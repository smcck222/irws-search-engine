FT  12 OCT 94 / Solace is discovered on distant shores: Jurek Martin finds
President Clinton enjoying foreign policy success - for now
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not for the first time, a US president in domestic trouble has found
temporary solace in foreign policy. For Mr Bill Clinton, the change may be
bittersweet, but the sudden absence of serious criticism about his conduct
of external affairs is worth savouring when his social reform programme at
home lies in partial ruins.
On Monday night, he was able to go on national television and to exude
confidence and resolve on two difficult fronts. Iraq's 'reckless
provocation' in the Gulf would be faced down by US military might and
Haiti's military regime would keep its commitment not only to relinquish
power but also to go into exile.
Mr Clinton was careful also to note the recent successful visits to the US
by President Boris Yeltsin of Russia and President Nelson Mandela of South
Africa. He could well have added the announcement in Washington last week of
progress in negotiations between Israel and Jordan, and the current mission
of his secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher, to Syria.
If he had felt very bold, or mischievous, the president might also have
mentioned the cessation of violence in Northern Ireland in the wake of US
initiatives. He could even have taken satisfaction in the defusing of trade
conflict with Japan.
Mr Clinton himself, who had cancelled a Monday campaign trip to New Jersey
to tend to the Gulf, was able to leave for Michigan yesterday to raise funds
for Democratic party candidates.
But the word from the White House - with Mr Leon Panetta, the chief of
staff, now more firmly in control - was to keep talk of any political
benefit in the mid-term US elections early next month to a minimum. 'We'll
leave that to the pundits,' one anonymous official said.
That caution is probably well advised. The current public mood does not look
kindly on foreign entanglements, though President Saddam Hussein of Iraq is
enough of a popular villain after the 1991 Gulf war to be considered a
special case. There may be admiration for the role by US troops in Haiti,
but the US occupation is still viewed at home with much scepticism.
History also suggests, as Mr Kevin Phillips pointed out in a recent edition
of his newsletter, American Political Report, that, although foreign
'October surprises' may influence presidential elections, they have much
less impact on the mid-term contests.
The only clear exception was the resolution of the Cuban missile crisis in
late October 1962, which cut projected heavy Democratic losses to only four
seats in the House of Representatives, offset by a gain of two in the
Senate. Mr Clinton would give his political eye-teeth for such an outcome on
November 8.
More telling: the Camp David agreement on the Middle East, in September
1978, lifted President Jimmy Carter's standing in the opinion polls by 10-16
points, but most of that had faded by the following November, when the
Democrats incurred losses. The US troop build-up in the Gulf in the autumn
of 1990, after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was, to the US electorate, both
controversial at the time and, in any case, overshadowed by poor economic
news.
However, Mr Clinton and the Democrats can take momentary consolation from
the fact that the Republican party assault on the foreign policy front has
been silenced, for now. Former officials of the Bush administration,
including Mr Laurence Eagleburger, once a caustic secretary of state, have
commended the president's resolve in the Gulf.
Mr Dick Cheney, ex-defence secretary, merely added the barb that it did not
look likely that Mr Clinton would have to send Mr Carter to Baghdad to
negotiate.
Criticism has emanated from the wilder shores. Mr Ross Perot, the 1992
independent presidential candidate who is urging his supporters to vote
Republican on November 8, naturally thought the Gulf confrontation a put-up
job to save Mr Clinton's skin.
Mr Oliver North, Republican candidate for the US senate in Virginia,
announced that Mr Clinton was not 'my commander-in-chief', and charged that
he had eviscerated US defence capability and thus encouraged Saddam Hussein.
This caused embarrassment to Senator Phil Gramm, a Republican from Texas,
who was at Mr North's side.
Local pundits thought he might have made his first serious campaign mistake
thereby. He certainly provided scope yesterday for Vice-President Al Gore,
who called Mr North's statements 'unpatriotic and despicable', and said he
was 'giving aid and comfort to a foreign dictator'.
The irony of Mr Clinton as an international tough guy, a role he did not
come to office intent on playing, is not lost on the US public, but the
transformation has won grudging approval in Washington. Both the state and
defence departments, the object of much virulent criticism for nearly two
years, suddenly seem in much surer hands, with rumours of more changes at
the top quiet for now.
During one month, Mr Clinton has twice dispatched substantial US military
contingents overseas. In Haiti, this may have been the only available
alternative after much agony over policy - and at least the occupation was
achieved with few guns blazing - but in the Gulf the second thoughts that
have often seemed to paralyse his administration have not been in evidence.
Both missions could yet become messy, as happened in Somalia. The Gulf
engagement, in particular, raises longer-term problems about how best to
contain Mr Saddam if the Iraqis themselves cannot dispose of him. Still, for
a beleaguered president, these may seem manageable after what happened to
his ambitious domestic programmes.

FT  12 OCT 94 / US machine tool 'opportunity'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US machine tool industry, in steep decline for more than a decade, has
an opportunity to recapture a significant share of the global market it used
to dominate, according to a report published yesterday by the
California-based Rand research institution.
Machine tool builders in the US are benefiting by a strong surge in demand,
technological advances and corporate restructuring, along with setbacks to
rivals in Japan and Germany, says Rand's Critical Technologies Institute.
The Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) US industry is relatively small and
fragmented, but is strategically important.
'A weak domestic industry means that the US risks losing access to the
latest manufacturing technologies,' says the report.
The US accounted for about 19 per cent of world machine tool production in
1981. However, by 1992, its share had slipped to about 8 per cent and its
position in the industry from first to a distant fourth behind Japan,
Germany and Italy.
In 1992, concerned by the US producers' collapse, Congress directed Rand to
produce the report. It says Japanese producers filled orders more quickly
with cheaper, more reliable products when US demand picked up after the
1981-83 recession.
In contrast, the US industry failed to rebound for various reasons. These
included a lack of enough big producers, weak export capacity, and poor
performance in the translating of technological research into market
advantage.
Many of these barriers remained but recent developments suggested a brighter
future. In particular, domestic demand rose 25 per cent last year.
The report suggests the US government could foster development of local
co-operative networks among small and medium-sized machine tool makers and
users, invest in the manufacturing infrastructure so as to bolster the
translation of research leadership into a production edge, and help US
machine tool builders compete internationally.
The Decline of the US Machine Tool Industry and Prospects for its
Sustainable Recovery: Vol 1; from Rand's Distribution Services, PO Box 2138,

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European exporters' organisations have threatened legal action against the
European Commission if it does not move quickly against a shipowners'
agreement to set prices across the north Atlantic. The British and French
Shippers' Councils have written to the commission's competition directorate
 -DG4 - demanding measures to outlaw the Trans-Atlantic Agreement (TAA). The
shippers are worried that unless action is taken soon, the TAA will go into
its third year and exporters will face price rises of 15 per cent on cargoes
crossing the north Atlantic.
The TAA is a 'conference' or agreement between 15 large shipping lines
accounting for about 85 per cent of sailings between northern Europe and the
US, to regulate both rates and capacity. It was introduced to stem losses by
shipping lines, and its members include many large container shipping lines
such as P&amp;A, Nedlloyd and Maersk.
The European Commission has issued a temporary judgment objecting to the
TAA, but shippers are now pressing for a final ruling. They also want a
decision to outlaw a compromise agreement, the Trans-Atlantic Conference
Agreement, proposed by the shipowners in July.

<TEXT>
Member states of the European Union and the European Commission yesterday
came before judges at the European Court of Justice for a case, the outcome
of which should allow the EU to ratify the Uruguay Round trade accord before
the January 1 1995 deadline.
The commission asked the court for its opinion after a disagreement with
member states over who has the power to negotiate in certain trade areas -
such as transport, services, and intellectual property rights. The
commission has argued it should ratify the Uruguay Round, under those
articles of the Rome and Maastricht treaties that give it exclusive
authority to negotiate on trade. But member states yesterday argued there
was a limit as to how far the commission could claim to have exclusive
competence in these areas.
The judges are expected to give their opinion on what constitutes the
correct legal basis for ratification on November 15.

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, will today announce a
telecoms development project in China which may mark a watershed in the
opening of the market to foreign telecoms operators. The deal will involve
Hongkong Telecom, of which C&amp;W owns a majority stake, in a joint venture
with Chinese partners to expand telecoms services. Until now, China has
maintained a state monopoly over telecoms services, although western
equipment suppliers have long been established there.
A leading Hong Kong analyst said the agreement would involve either a
substantial loan from HongKong Telecom tied to an operating agreement, or a
leasing arrangement, either of which might in time be convertible into
equity. 'This is a watershed, which could lead within months to a far wider
opening up of the Chinese telecoms to overseas operators,' he said.
The agreement follows months of contacts between C&amp;W and China's ministry of
posts and telecommunications and the Chinese government, during which the
ministry nominated C&amp;W as its 'preferred partner' for future operations.
China has ambitious plans to increase its number of phone lines from about
30m to at least 110m within the next decade. But state operators are
believed to be finding it increasingly difficult to secure supplier finance
for telecoms expansion, which has obliged them to move faster than expected
on joint ventures with network operators.

FT  12 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Free zone at centre of Turk trading hopes
 -Eric Watkins visits a site well placed for new emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC WATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cases of galvanised steel, piles of aluminium ingots, and crates of electric
fans testify to the growing importance of the Turkish city of Trabzon as a
free trade zone.
Located at the south-east corner of the Black Sea, Trabzon is well placed as
a centre for trade with the newly emerging markets of the former Soviet
Union.
'The fall of the Soviet Union has in fact played a crucial part in our
new-found success,' says Mr Alaattin Yuksel, governor of the region.
'Trabzon's historic role as a key centre of east-west trade ended
temporarily when the communists closed off the main trading routes. . . .
Those routes can (now) be reopened and trade resumed, much to our benefit,'
he says.
Some of those benefits have already become apparent, especially through the
growing influx of former Soviet citizens clamouring to buy Turkish goods for
re-sale at home. According to Mr Yuksel, Trabzon last year had more than
750,000 visitors from the former Soviet Union, most of them on day trips via
the Black Sea resort of Sochi.
But the Turkish government envisions even greater benefits from Trabzon's
free trade zone, one of five in the country. Established in June 1992, the
free trade zone is owned and managed by Transbas Trabzone Serbest Bolge
Isleticisi, a joint venture between the Turkish government's Maritime
Corporation, the UK's Balli Group, and the Marubeni Corporation of Japan.
The zone occupies 16 acres of the port area and offers 5,500 sq m of
warehouse space in the first phase of its development. Two further phases
are planned that will see warehouse facilities doubled to 11,000 sq m,
including 1,500 sq m of cold storage facilities. Further developments will
consist of storage tanks for chemicals and edible oils, as well as grain
silos and bagging facilities for sugar and fertilisers.
Current facilities in the port consist of seven quays, with a capacity of
2,000 ships a year and a modern container terminal. Cargo handling is,
according to the port authorities, provided on a two-shift basis for 17
hours a day while pilotage is available 24 hours a day. Onward delivery by
road is handled by local operators with up to 1,500 trucks available
monthly, depending on seasonal demand.
Trabzon's free trade zone has so far relied exclusively on sea and road
transport. There are plans to link in the local airport as well. But even
without use of the airport facilities, trade through the free zone has
boomed. Indeed, in dollar terms, the total volume of trade has increased
nearly five-fold in just more than two years of operations.
'The volume of trade for the first six months this year alone equalled last
year's and we expect to repeat that performance in the next six months,'
says Mr Kerim Kalafatoglu, chief executive officer of Cey International
Trading, a firm which trades within the zone. 'Location is a primary asset,
especially with the emerging markets in central Asia.'
To capitalise on those markets Turkish businessmen are aiming to establish
further free trade zones in neighbouring countries and to link them with
Trabzon by road transport. The Ulusoy group, predominant in Turkish
long-haul trucking, but also with interests in oil and insurance, have
already begun negotiations for such zones in Batumi, Tiblisi, and Baku.
Their aim, ultimately, is to use the linkages as a trade corridor with the
central Asian republics, oil-rich Kazakhstan in particular.
So far the bulk of trade through the Trabzon free zone has been from the
west with European countries supplying nearly 45 per cent of the goods
passing through the port. Much of that trade has involved industrial
materials and such traffic is expected to increase substantially as
developments associated with oil take off in nearby Azerbaijan and
Kazakhstan. Authorities in Trabzon's free zone hope that such developments
will stimulate an increased flow of trade from the east.
But Turkish ambitions do not end there. 'The Turks,' says a local
businessman, 'remember the days of their empire and are seeking to
re-establish their presence through trade in all directions of historic
interest whether in central Asia, the Middle East or North Africa'.
'Watch and you will see. The Turks are on the move and Trabzon plays a key
role in their plans.'

FT  12 OCT 94 / World Trade News: NEC plans Dollars 50m investment in
California semiconductor plant - Japanese company to produce 64-megabit
memory chip in US

NEC, the Japanese electronics group, yesterday announced
it would invest Dollars 50m in its semiconductor manufacturing facility in
California, becoming the first company to mass produce next generation
64-megabit chips in the US.
NEC also revised upwards its planned 1994-5 capital investment in
semiconductors by Y15bn (Dollars 153.1m). This would bring total investment
in semiconductor facilities in the year to March 1995 to Y125bn. This
represents a 39 per cent increase from the initial plan to invest Y90bn in
semiconductor facilities this year.
The decision to increase investments in semiconductor manufacturing
facilities follows last month's announcement of an Dollars 800m investment
in the company's semiconductor manufacturing facility in Scotland for
increased memory chip production.
'I am optimistic about the future D-Ram (dynamic random access memory)
market,' says Mr Hajime Sasaki, senior executive vice president in charge of
the semiconductor business.
In Japan, the video games and computer printer industries are providing a
strong demand for semiconductors as the advanced products coming to the
market require a larger memory.
The emerging multimedia market, with personal computers increasingly using
CD-Roms (small plastic discs on which vast amounts of information can be
stored and retrieved) for incorporating video images, is also supporting
buoyant demand for memories. Mr Sasaki said last month that there is a 20
per cent worldwide shortfall in memory chips.
NEC's investment at its Roseville plant in California, where it manufactures
current generation 4-megabit and 16-megabit D-Rams will go towards upgrading
existing facilities.
Although Roseville is acknowledged to be one of the company's most
successful plants, it lost out to the Livingston plant for the more
substantial investment of Dollars 800m.
NEC's decision to manufacture 64-megabit D-Rams, which are expected to come
into production around 1997, stems from the need for customers to secure
stable supply and flexibility, Mr Sasaki said.
Other new investments, making up the Y15bn increase in capital spending,
will be at four of its manufacturing facilities in Japan and facilities in
Malaysia and Singapore.
A strong increase in sales has lent support to NEC's increased investment
plans. In the first half of the current fiscal year, NEC's semiconductor
production value increased 11 per cent from Y395bn to Y440bn, the company
said yesterday. This was also a Y5bn increase from NEC's original estimate
for the year.
NEC expects full year shipments of semiconductors to increase by 12 per cent
to Y910bn from a previous Y810bn.
The company maintains an even more bullish outlook for its semiconductor
sales in the year to March 1996 when it expects sales to at least top
Y1,000bn for the first time.
Japanese chip companies are eager not to slip behind their US competitors'
expansion in capacity.
NEC last year lost its position as the world's top semiconductor producer in
dollar sales terms to Intel of the US, a symbolic blow which it intends to
redress.

FT  12 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Honda to manufacture car parts in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Honda, the vehicle maker, yesterday became the first Japanese company to
announce it would set up a joint venture to make car parts in China.
Honda said that it had reached agreement with Dong Feng Motor to produce
cast and forged parts.
The deal is in line with Chinese government policy to develop the country's
car parts industry and encourage foreign investments that will bring
technology to China.
Honda will establish a joint venture called Dong Feng Honda Automobile Parts
to be equally owned by Honda and its Chinese partner. The company will
invest Dollars 20m to build a new plant in Guangdong province in the
southern part of China.
The company will start producing parts in early 1996, which will be exported
to Honda's Asian vehicle production facilities. The initial production
target of parts for 50,000 cars in 1996 is expected to rise to 150,000 by
the year 2000.
Honda said that its decision to invest in parts production in China stemmed
from a desire to be in a growing market rather than from a need to combat
the impact of the yen's sharp appreciation. Although parts made in China
will replace those made in Japan and exported to its other Asian facilities,
the investment required will mean that initially costs will rise.
Honda already has four joint ventures in China, but this is its first
venture in the car sector. The others are in the motorcycle and power
equipment sectors.
Beijing has signalled its intention to strengthen the components sector, a
weak link in its vehicle-building industry.
Foreign car companies such as Ford, General Motors and Toyota have been told
that to 'qualify' for entry to China as fully-fledged participants in
passenger car manufacturing they must first invest in the components
industry.
Japanese companies are willing to go along with the policy in order to win
entry into a highly promising market. Toyota, for example, is also in talks
over the possibility of setting up a joint venture to manufacture car parts.
Toyota has held discussions with Tianjin Automobile Industry, a partner of
Daihatsu in the production of the Charade small car and minibuses. Toyota
has a 16 per cent stake in Daihatsu.
According to Japanese press reports, Toyota hopes by the end of this year to
start building a factory near Tianjin to produce engines, transmissions and
other main components for cars that would be sold domestically.

<TEXT>
China aims to export Dollars 150bn worth of electronics and machinery
annually by early next century under an ambitious three-phase plan aimed at
securing a substantial share of the world market.
'Expanding exports is the key to the development of China's machinery and
electronics industries,' the official China Daily newspaper quoted an
official of the Ministry of Machinery Industry as saying.
Exports of machinery and electronics are expected to reach Dollars 26bn this
year, an increase of Dollars 3.3bn or 14.5 per cent over last year's figure
of Dollars 22.7bn.
China has targeted the machine-building and electronics sectors as offering
the best options for rapid export growth. These are also areas of the
economy in which foreign investors are active.
Taiwanese, Hong Kong, Japanese and South Korean companies are investing
heavily in consumer electronics. Taiwanese manufacturers, for example, have
transferred to the mainland the manufacture of basic items such as computer
keyboards and disc drives. Pocket calculators are another item that is being
manufactured in increasing numbers in China for export.
China plans to increase exports of electronics and machinery to Dollars 30bn
by 1995, Dollars 60bn by 2000, and to exceed Dollars 100bn by the early part
of the next century, according to the three-phase plan. In 1993, exports of
these items accounted for 30 per cent of total exports of Dollars 86.3bn.
Exports of all manufactured items grew from 49.8 per cent of China's total
exports in 1980 to 78.5 per cent in 1993. Export growth for these items
reached 9.6 per cent in 1993 compared with the previous year.
China's coastal provinces have the lion's share of machinery and electronics
exports with Guangdong province dominant. Guangdong's exports last year
accounted for 62.1 per cent of the total, reflecting a surge of Taiwan and
Hong Kong investment.
China's export drive in products known as elaborately transformed
manufactures (ETMs), reflects a desire to become more competitive in both
world and domestic markets. This also coincides with Beijing's moves to
re-enter the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
'Only when Chinese companies can compete on the world market can they keep a
lock on the domestic market,' said an official quoted by China Daily.
'If domestic companies dare not enter the world market, they will almost
certainly lose the home one,' he said.
A senior US trade negotiator yesterday said China must make much faster
progress and be more flexible if it is to meet its goal of entering Gatt by
the end of the year. Ms Charlene Barshefsky, the deputy US trade
representative, said in Beijing: 'If it is to realise its accession or
completion of negotiations by December 31st 1994, we would suggest China put
its foot on the Gatt pedal.' Talks on China's accession to Gatt have been
continuing in Geneva for several weeks.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Inflation 'will stay China's big headache'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's economy is headed for a 'soft landing' in 1995, but inflation is
likely to remain the country's biggest headache, according to a joint report
by the State Statistical Bureau and the Academy of Social Sciences.
The authoritative study, based on the first eight months of this year,
forecast inflation for 1994 at 19.5 per cent and GDP growth at 11.5 per
cent, compared with a planning target of 9 per cent.
The study predicted what it described as a 'smooth slowdown' next year, with
growth of 10 per cent and inflation of 13 per cent. The report said that
most economic indicators had been 'getting nearer' government projections.
Economists had expressed fears that Beijing's attempts to curb monetary
growth and impose tighter credit ceilings risked severe retrenchment, but
GDP trends indicate that the economy is continuing to grow strongly.
China registered average GDP growth in the past two years of 13 per cent and
this contributed to overheating and inflation, partly fuelled by a capital
spending boom.
The study said that apart from inflation, China's 'prominent problems'
included excessive investment in fixed assets, poor performance of some
state-owned enterprises, relatively low growth in the agricultural sector,
and a development gap between regions.
Consumer prices in China's 35 biggest cities surged by 27.1 per cent in
August compared with the same month last year. China's leaders have made
fighting inflation their main priority, and have instituted price controls
on basic foodstuffs and services.
The survey predicted China's trade deficit would narrow this year, with
exports of Dollars 115bn (Pounds 76.6bn) and imports of Dollars 120bn,
compared with a deficit last year of about Dollars 10.4bn. The manufacturing
sector would show strongest growth this year of 16 per cent, with services
growing by 10 per cent and agriculture 3 per cent.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Vietnam's dollar ban confuses investors: Hanoi move to end
parallel money halts hard currency spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweeping regulations outlawing the use of the US dollar in most transactions
in Vietnam and favouring the local currency, the dong, appear to have dealt
a psychological blow to investors who have depended on foreign currency
revenues for profits.
The new rules have been announced by the prime minister but left to the
central bank, known as the State Bank, to implement. Under them, hotels,
airlines, taxis and shops are, as of October 1, no longer allowed to
advertise prices in dollars and will only accept payment in the not freely
convertible dong.
The measure also requires Vietnamese organisations to channel their hard
currency earnings through banks, rather than holding cash. Already in the
capital Hanoi and the south's Ho Chi Minh City, mini foreign exchange
counters have sprouted in hotels and restaurants, where tourists and
business people must exchange dollars for the local unit to pay bills
increasingly made out in dong.
Foreign investors are confused as to precisely how the rules will be
enforced and are worried about the effect it may have on investor
confidence.
Their biggest problem is working out how, under the rules, projects whose
earnings projections depend on dollar revenues will survive in an
environment where revenues are now earned in a currency which is impossible
to repatriate.
'At the moment people won't spend (hard currency) money until the position
is clarified,' said Bill Magennis, chief representative of Australian law
firm Phillips Fox.
The move in effect wipes out foreign companies' ability to receive earnings
in dollars and therefore to meet hard currency obligations abroad.
Indications from the State Bank are that clarifying guidelines will soon be
issued, possibly listing some exemptions. But until this is clearer, the
mood among foreign investors is likely to remain one of concern.
'Unless you can get some sort of counter trade sorted out, you're going to
be stuck with profits in a non-convertible currency,' said Tony Foster,
resident partner of London-based law firm Freshfields.
'You've got no assurance that you can get your money out of the country.'
There are also fears the move may drive the currency underground.
'Everyone's going to get dollars wherever they can and that's going to
create a black market,' Mr Foster added.
There are a few exceptions under the 1992 Law on Foreign Investment, which
allows for exporters, infrastructure investors and certain import
substitution projects freely to convert dong earnings into hard currency.
But since Vietnam opened up to foreign investors in the late 1980s, the
greenback has been the currency of choice for most transactions, with
business people and tourists preferring to pay in dollars rather than
unwieldy bundles of dong.
Now, everything from restaurant meals to purchases of foreign-made machinery
for investment projects will have to be made in dong. Although the local
unit has in the last two years stabilised against the dollars at around
11,000 dong to the dollar, the highest denomination note is 50,000 dong.
Policymakers are hoping the move will dampen inflation, which rose an
alarming 1.6 per cent in September from the previous month, endangering the
government's target of single-figure inflation for the whole year. Inflation
in the first nine months was 9.9 per cent, government statistics show.
Hanoi signalled its determination to eliminate the dual currency system in
statements earlier this year, aiming to siphon an estimated Dollars 800m in
dollar bills in circulation into the banking system and curb the growth of a
'shadow' economy in a country of 72m people.
Vietnam is particularly keen to ensure that roughly 300 Vietnamese
enterprises that trade primarily in dollars will in future channel their
hard currency through the banking system.
'Dollars are now the means of payment in the shadow economy,' said one
Vietnamese economist and top government planner. 'But by circulating Dollars
800m in Vietnam, Hanoi is providing Washington with Dollars 800m credit
without interest. The regulation is necessary because we need to get this
into the banking system.'
Hanoi has also launched a modest domestic bond sales programme targeted at
local Vietnamese, with the aim of coaxing an estimated Dollars 2bn in gold
and dollars currently stockpiled in people's homes. The idea is to try to
shore up foreign exchange reserves and attract more overseas loan for
development.
Foreign investors - particularly in the hotels sector - are likely to be
keen to seek exemptions from the ruling so that they will be able to convert
their dong earnings into dollars. It is understood that the State Bank has
set a deadline of the end of this month by which applications should be
made.
According to one State Bank official, they may receive a sympathetic
hearing. 'In principle, the State Bank says this is all right, but there
will have to be guidelines published detailing exactly how far this goes,'
he said.
Foreign bankers generally welcomed the move as a way of removing the
parallel currency system, but pinned the chances of success on how the rules
are enforced.
'I think that in the long term, it's a good move,' said one Hanoi-based
banker. 'It actively encourages some bona fide transactions to go through
the banking system. Certainly, the intention is not to scare away foreign
investors. But the way the transition is managed will be crucial.'

FT  12 OCT 94 / Japanese companies buy more machinery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese companies bought more machinery in August for the third month
running, the latest evidence that the decline in capital spending has
bottomed out.
A 7.1 per cent rise in machinery orders from the same month last year shows
machinery purchases could grow 4.7 per cent from the second to the and third
quarter of this year, the government's Economic Planning Agency said. But Mr
Ryutaro Hashimoto, international trade and industry minister, cautioned
yesterday on the strength of capital investment recovery.
A slow pick-up in capital investment, especially for small and medium
businesses, figured among several worries over the slowness of Japan's
economic recovery, he said. He feared small business output would revive
more slowly than in previous recoveries, and reductions in unsold stocks and
materials were 'stumbling'. The yen's continuing strength was a worry for
small businesses, Mr Hashimoto told the parliament's budget committee.
The recent growth in machinery orders, a leading indicator for overall
capital investment, has been driven mainly by exports and the public sector,
according to James Capel Pacific. The figures exclude shipbuilding and
electric power utilities.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lin Chen-kuo, Taiwan's finance minister, and Mr Day Linin, chairman of
the securities and exchange commission, are to appear before the
legislature's finance committee today for questioning.
There have been calls for their resignations for their alleged part in a
share market controversy that sent stock prices plummeting 14.7 per cent in
a week.
Mr Ma Ying-jeou, justice minister, told the legislature yesterday that the
government would crack down on illegal share trading activities, and those
responsible for the defaults crisis would be brought to justice.
The episode erupted last Wednesday when Hung Fu Securities, controlled by
the Hualon Group, bounced a cheque to the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corp,
triggering a rash of cheque defaults totalling TDollars 7.6bn (Pounds 182m).
Mr Lin and Mr Day will be asked to explain why they did not begin earlier to
investigate suspicious trading in shares of Imperial Hotel, controlled by
the Hualon group. The price of shares in the hotel rose from TDollars 75 to
TDollars 402 over 10 months, sparking concerns among underground financiers
lending to Hualon's chief, Mr Oung Ta-ming, which led them to withdraw
funds.
Investigations could show that legislators, big companies and even
government officials figured among Mr Oung's financial links. The three main
political parties yesterday announced party members found to be involved
would be punished.
Officials made a surprise raid on Mr Oung's headquarters late on Thursday
night and seized documents relating to the share crisis.
Mr Oung's chief trader and financial manager, Ms Li Hsiu-fen, was detained
last Thursday morning as she tried to flee the country and has been held
incommunicado since. Ms Li was responsible for Mr Oung's share trading
activities as well as negotiating with the underground financiers who backed
him.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Prize for Rabin, Arafat starts row

<TEXT>
The Nobel Peace Prize committee, wracked by its worst dispute in two
decades, has decided to give this year's award to Israeli prime minister
Yitzhak Rabin and PLO leader Yassir Arafat, the Oslo newspaper Aftenposten
reported yesterday, AP reports from Oslo. It said one committee member, Mr
Kaare Kristiansen, a pro-Israeli former government minister, was so angered
by the decision that he plans to resign in protest when the prize is
announced in Oslo on Friday.
The report appeared to break a tradition of secrecy before formal
announcement of the most coveted of the Nobel Prizes. Each award is worth
SKr7m (Pounds 600,000) this year. Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin gave an impetus to
Middle East peace with a handshake on the White House lawn on September 13
1993. They then signed a declaration of principles on limited Palestinian
self-rule as a first step toward an overall peace settlement.
Aftenposten said the five-member committee struggled with its decision at a
meeting last Friday over who should be honoured for achieving last year's
Middle East peace breakthrough during secret talks in Norway. The newspaper
said the committee might meet again in an attempt to patch up the dispute.
The committee can change its mind until the last minute, but Aftenposten
said this was unlikely as most members wanted Mr Arafat to share the prize.
Aftenposten said Mr Kristiansen had opposed Mr Arafat throughout the
selection process. He refused to confirm or deny the selection or his threat
to resign.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Thai state sell-offs prove to be a half-hearted business:
Privatisation can mean the government retains control and will not let go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
When is a privatisation not a privatisation? The answer, according to
critics of Thailand's half-hearted attempts to sell state enterprises to the
public, is when the government retains management control over the
'privatised' company and will not let go.
Thai Airways International was floated on the Thai stock exchange more than
two years ago, but only 7 per cent of the company was offered to private
investors; the poor performance of the shares has delayed the sale of
further tranches; the finance ministry has 93 per cent.
The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (Egat) embarks on
privatisation in the next few weeks by floating a subsidiary called Egco
that will own at least one power station, but Egat will keep a controlling
stake and sell only half the shares to the public.
The Telephone Organisation of Thailand (TOT), which failed for years to
provide Thailand with enough telephone lines, has contracted private
companies to instal 3m new lines in exchange for a share of revenues. But
the TOT and the Communications Authority of Thailand (CAT) maintain monopoly
control over local and international calls respectively.
In the oil industry, the Petroleum Authority of Thailand still controls 71
per cent of PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP), the subsidiary it
floated last year. Private investors hold only 20 per cent of Bangchak
Petroleum, the oil refiner and distributor floated last month. 'It's not
real privatisation,' says Mr Prachai Leophairatana, chief executive of the
privately-owned Thai Petrochemical Industry. 'The government still holds and
controls the whole thing.'
Thailand has embraced the principle of privatisation since 1988, both to
raise funds for heavy capital spending by state utilities and to increase
their efficiency, but successive governments have been slow to implement the
policy. Until now, there has been little sense of urgency. Egat, the biggest
state enterprise, has increased electricity generating capacity fast enough
to meet surging demand in Thailand's fast-growing economy.
In other state companies, some managers are reluctant to lose control of
lucrative fiefdoms or open the financial accounts of their companies to the
public. Before its privatisation, Thai Airways was controlled by the air
force; the company bought a bewildering array of aircraft and engines which
appeared to have little to do with building an efficient airline. Civilian
managers are now attempting to rationalise the company.
'Anomalies are more apparent in listed companies,' says Mr George Morgan of
stockbrokers HG Asia. 'It's much easier to spot where money can be siphoned
out.' He claims: 'Vested interests are woven deep' into the fabric of
various organisations. Anxious about the slow pace of privatisation, the
Thai finance ministry last year asked the World Bank to send a mission to
Thailand to examine the issue.
Mrs Manimai Vudtitornetiraks, one of the privatisation officials, says the
various state enterprises and their parent ministries have been reluctant to
privatise. 'I don't think we can force any ministry to do it, but we can try
to pressure them,' she says. 'That is why we asked the World Bank to make
suggestions. We expect to see a steady stream of privatisations but each
ministry will have to make the move itself."
World Bank officials are in no doubt about the benefits of selling state
companies to investors. 'Massive capital need is driving privatisation,'
says Mr Ismail Dalla, head of the Bank's privatisation mission to Thailand.
According to Mr Dalla, the 15 Thai utilities on which the Bank concentrated
its research have Dollars 94bn (Pounds 62.6bn) of capital expenditure
requirements up to the year 2000. They are not badly run and can generate
Dollars 41bn internally, but still need a further Dollars 53bn. 'If this
financing gap is taken care of by the private sector, the government can
focus on education, environment policy and welfare, which should be the role
of the government,' says Mr Dalla.
Apart from recommending the use of a range of international and domestic
financing mechanisms to ease the strain on the Thai equity market as it
absorbs huge privatisation issues, the bank has delicately suggested that
Thailand should end the confusion arising from the hesitant privatisation
moves made thus far.
The most pressing need is for independent regulators. At present the
state-owned TOT and CAT are expanding into new telecommunications markets
via private concessions and acting simultaneously as operators and
regulators. If the TOT and CAT are privatised, they could find themselves
competing against, and regulating, their own contractors.
Egat will be in a similar position in the electricity market. It would
hardly be surprising if Egat favoured Egco, which it controls, over its
private-sector rivals in the awarding of power contracts.
Indeed it already does so, according to Mr Prachai; he says Egat will buy
surplus electricity from his petrochemicals complex at a much lower price
than from Egco.
'We are not aware of any country that has chosen to promote private power by
creating a generating company that is affiliated with, and competes for, the
purchases of its parent company,' comments the draft World Bank report on
Thai privatisation.
'We recommend that the government fully divest Egco as soon as possible.'
State enterprise managers and employees may balk at privatisation because
they fear the loss of sinecures, but they are also tempted by windfall
profits from share offerings and by big salary increases for civil servants
who suddenly become executives in a 'private-sector' company.
'It is kind of tricky when you are taking away someone's toy,' says Mr
Vuthipong Priebjrivat, managing director of Thailand Rating and Information
Services, which assigns credit ratings to potential bond issuers.
'But once they realise they can get another, perhaps even more attractive,
toy when their business expands, they get interested.'
The World Bank's Mr Dalla agrees. 'A year and a half ago there was a lot of
fear, especially among the employees. But after PTTEP and Bangchak I think
they realise it's a win-win situation because all the employees become
wealthier through privatisation ..I think it will accelerate. There are
really no major hurdles in the way.'

<TEXT>
Lounes Mahtoub, the Kabyle Berber singer, kidnapped by Islamic guerrillas
two weeks ago, was released on Monday evening, Francis Ghiles writes from
Paris. The kidnapping of the popular singer, who strongly identifies with
Berber culture, had brought out 100,000 people into the streets of the
regional capital of Tizi Ouzou.
The kidnapping appears to have been the work of the extremist Islamic Armed
Group. The release of the singer appears to have been negotiated through
traditional channels of family and clan, Mr Mahtoub's family having
threatened retribution on the families of two of the kidnappers, who were
also Kabyle Berbers.

FT  12 OCT 94 / France offers gulf forces, but without enthusiasm
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France has told the US that French forces in the Gulf region are available
for any allied riposte to Iraq, but has so far moved only a single frigate
towards Kuwait, in an effort not to over-dramatise the situation.
In the same relatively cool vein, the French Foreign Ministry said yesterday
that Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, saw no need to modify his
planned trip to other three Gulf states this weekend by stopping off in
Kuwait.
Mr Juppe told his US counterpart, Mr Warren Christopher, on Monday that
Paris shared Washington's 'serious concern' about Iraqi threats to Kuwait,
and that its forces in the general region, including six Mirages in Saudi
Arabia, five Jaguars in Turkey, two ships in Muscat and 4,000 men in
Djibouti, would be available for any necessary action.
Just as France had been somewhat readier than the US or Britain to
contemplate an easing of sanctions against Bagdhad after a trial period of a
new United Nations monitoring system in Iraq, so France has been a bit less
enthusiastic than its Anglo-American Security Council partners to return in
force to the Gulf.
While Mr Juppe stressed that no risks should be taken with Iraqi troops, his
Foreign Ministry officials were cautioning against 'excessive dramatisation'
of the situation lest very rapid mobilisation on both sides of the
Iraqi-Kuwaiti frontier should make a clash almost inevitable.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Crisis could bring a blessing to Kuwait: US troop presence
will almost surely mean a mini-boom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kuwait's financial and business community has praised the professionalism
displayed by the government, the central bank and the Kuwait Investment
Authority (KIA) in maintaining public confidence and forestalling panic in
the emirate by 'flooding the market with liquidity,' as one banker put it
yesterday.
It is too early to assess the full impact of this latest crisis with Iraq,
but the presence of more than 70,000 US and other troops will almost
certainly lead to a mini-boom among importers, traders, and retailers and
increased activity in consumer durables, foodstuffs and the catering
business.
If the US maintains its resolve over Iraq and Saddam Hussein's ability to
intimidate Kuwait is eliminated, many in the banking and business
communities believe a more stable and healthy political environment could
emerge. This would lift Kuwait's, and the region's, economy out of the
present stagnation.
The rush to get cash and hard foreign currencies, which began on Friday, had
largely dissipated by Monday night, and according to some bankers had been
reversed by yesterday, when Kuwaiti dinars were again in demand and cash was
being returned to banks.
Given the imbalance in Kuwait's population between nationals and foreigners,
bankers said the rush to convert had sensibly been anticipated by the
central bank.
Of Kuwait's total population of 1.75m, only 670,000 are nationals, latest
figures from Al-Shall Economic Consultants show. Its head, Mr Jassem
Al-Saadoun, is an independent economic adviser to Kuwait's parliament. The
balance of some 1.1m people is made up largely of low-income workers, mainly
expatriate Arabs, some 519,000 Asians (mostly Indians), 7,200 Europeans,
4,400 North Americans, 282 South Americans and 479 Australians.
Those Kuwaitis who sold dinars were simply transferring money overseas
rather than taking cash. The demand for hard-currency cash came from the
foreigners; the demand volume from banks' automatic teller machines over the
Friday and Saturday banking weekend was always manageable. The population as
a whole stocked up on food, water and petrol, the last of which sells for
less than Dollars 0.5 per gallon.
According to Mr Ibrahim Dabdoub, chief executive of National Bank of Kuwait
(NBK), the leading commercial bank, the central bank minimised panic by
instructing all banks to ensure public demand was met. The only problem
encountered was getting hard-currency notes from one branch to another.
The government has gained in other ways.
It has frequently been at odds with the national assembly over the
management of the economy, but sensibly used Friday's emergency cabinet
meeting as a chance to invite the assembly's speaker, Mr Ahmad al-Saadoun,
into its councils.
Communication has also improved between government and the public, largely
because government spokesmen have encouraged the local press to be as
outspoken as it wants.
Even Kuwait's stock exchange, for years almost moribund, but recently
reviving, has reacted favourably. Share prices lost a little in the first
two days of the crisis, but since recovered.
The real underlying problems confronting the economy - the fall-out from,
successively, the Souk al-Manakh crisis when the unofficial stock market
crashed in August 1982, the instability from the Iran-Iraq war which only
ended in 1988, the oil-price fall of 1986, the Iraqi invasion of August 1990
and its aftermath, all of which drained private sector confidence - can only
be met with a return to sustained political stability.
A measure of the local economy's stagnation is shown in central bank figures
to last June. Some 55 per cent of Kuwaiti commercial banks' assets are
represented by their holdings of government bonds; a further 20 per cent by
their overseas holdings.
Only about 12 per cent of commercial banks' assets are in loans to the
private sector. Most financing to the private sector is connected to the
government's spending on oil or oil-related projects. The public sector in
Kuwait is responsible for 75 per cent of overall economic activity.
But the government in turn only spends when it has enough money from oil,
which accounts for more than 85 per cent of annual budget revenue.
The combination of prolonged instability and a government strapped for cash
dominating the economy meant that for years the private sector has kept its
money overseas.
A portent of any impending economic recovery, were enduring political
stability to return to the northern Gulf, came in September with the public
issue of shares held by KIA in the Commercial Facilities Company (CFC), a
local consumer credit company.
National Bank of Kuwait acted as lead manager for a group of local banks and
investment companies which underwrote the issue on behalf of the government.
Originally, KIA intended to sell only 30m of the 98m shares, 55 per cent of
its holdings in CFC. However, the share issue was five times oversubscribed
and in face of this, KIA ended up selling 70m of its shares, reducing its
holding in CFC to a mere 15 per cent.
If confidence returns to Kuwait, further public share issues could be as
successful. Then, finally, Kuwait's economy could turn the corner.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Russians bemused by 'Black Tuesday': Either by accident or
design, the government appears to have lost control of the rouble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia is not the first country to experience the humiliating effects of a
currency market in full flight - although few devaluations can compare with
the rouble's fall, in speed and scale. Like many before them, Russian
ministers and central bankers yesterday were like puppets tossed around by
the savage forces of a panicking market.
The Russian media were quick to pronounce 'Black Tuesday' following the
'catastrophic fall' in the rouble. The reaction of ordinary Russians was one
of stunned incomprehension.
No one in the streets knew what it would mean for the everyday economy.
'Collapse? Hyper-inflation? We simply do not know,' said one confused
Russian. Currency exchanges shut their doors for 'technical reasons' as
anxious crowds milled around outside.
Mr Yuri Zarubin, who works at a computer company which sells software priced
off the dollar was fearful of the effects, thinking his company's sales
would be badly hit.
His wife, Olga, said: 'All the prices will go up again and I do not know how
we will buy the most basic things.'
What cannot be measured is the psychological damage the rouble's fall will
inflict. The value of the currency has great symbolic significance in
Russia. A television advertisement for one Russian finance company envisages
the day in 1999 when the dollar will have collapsed to a few kopeks against
the mighty resurgent rouble. Such advertisements tap into a deep vein of
Russian pride.
Throughout the summer the central bank appeared to have done a good job in
husbanding the rouble. Indeed, in real terms it had appreciated against the
dollar, encouraging people to hold roubles to the benefit of the Russian
government bond market.
Russia's reformist ministers spoke with pride about how they were winning
the confidence of the people. Their economic stabilisation policies were
having a visible effect. Russia was beginning to become a 'normal' country
once again.
How severely the government's economic programme will be jeopardised by the
rouble's fall is - as yet - impossible to tell. The devaluation will
undoubtedly bring relief to some parts of the economy - at least
temporarily. The energy sector, in particular, which sells oil and gas
abroad for hard currency, will make useful currency gains although they will
also have to pay more for imported equipment.
The devaluation may also help domestic manufacturers compete more
effectively against imports. The Russian government has been seeking to
protect domestic industry by raising import duties.
The rouble's fall will have a similar effect. The relative price of imported
goods will shoot up making life difficult for the western consumer goods
manufacturers active in the Russian market.
In comparison with most countries, however, imports still represent a
relatively small proportion of all traded goods - especially outside the big
cities.
Some economists argue that it is far from certain that the rush into the
dollar will fuel inflation.
The critical test will be the effect the devaluation will have on the prices
of domestic goods.
Some devaluations have proved beneficial in retrospect and there is a
certainly a benign interpretation that can be placed on the rouble's fall.
One western economist in Moscow says: 'There are two ways of viewing it. The
negative one is simply that the government has lost the trust of the people.
The other is that the government is letting the rouble slide to help
exchange rate stabilisation in 1995. On this view, the rouble's fall is a
policy pursued by the government not imposed by the market.'
At the government's budget meeting held at Sochi at the weekend, it is
believed ministers discussed an extremely tight budget for 1995 with the aim
of reducing the monthly inflation rate to 1 per cent. Credit emissions would
be strictly controlled and a real attempt would be made to produce a
stabilisation package for 1995.
But some ministers argued that trying to stabilise with the rouble at too
high a level would inflict further unacceptable pain on Russian industry.
'At this new rate all opposition within the government to trying to fix an
exchange rate next year has been eliminated. Previously there was a view
that the stabilisation policy was too tough for Russian industry,' says one
source familiar with the discussions.
The government believes that perhaps as much as Dollars 10bn of western
money would be needed to stabilise the exchange rate, but it fears that the
IMF will not move quickly enough to support a new level. The IMF will face
an agonising decision about the extent of its support following the rouble's
latest collapse.
The danger for the government is that its plans, if such they are, might yet
be defeated by the manner of their implementation. The problem perhaps is
not so much the level at which the rouble now trades but the speed with
which it has fallen.
There is not much the central bank can do to stabilise the situation if the
rouble continues to run out of control. Mr Victor Gerashchenko, chairman of
the bank, promised to raise interest rates today to help defend the
currency, but that will further damage Russian industry.
'The trouble is the government's credibility has been obliterated. It will
now be that much harder to try to stabilise the currency next time round,'
one western banker said.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Irish PM's pay increase raises issues of state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Irish prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, yesterday came under attack
from opposition politicians over a proposed 17 per cent pay rise which, they
said, would make him the second-highest paid head of government in Europe
while he has one of the smallest countries to run, Reuter reports from
Dublin.
The row broke out shortly after the resolution of a parliamentary dispute
over top legal appointments between Mr Reynolds's Fianna Fail party and its
junior Labour party coalition partner. The dispute had briefly raised the
prospect of an early general election.
The attack on Mr Reynolds's pay increase was headed by Mr John Bruton,
leader of the opposition Fine Gael party. 'We have a situation where our
prime minister is the second-highest paid in Europe, while we are one of the
smallest countries. He is now paid more than (the British prime minister)
John Major, who has a job which involves dealing with a population between
15 and 20 times as big as the one for which Mr Reynolds is responsible.'
The pay increase would give Mr Reynolds, whose country has a population of
3.5m, an annual salary of around IPounds 100,000 (Pounds 99,240), compared
with the DM442,000 (Pounds 181,000) earned by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
head of a nation of 75m people and Europe's best-paid political leader.
Mr Bruton tabled a motion calling for the pay increase to be postponed but
it was unlikely to be adopted by parliament, political sources said.
Earlier, the Labour party leader, Mr Dick Spring, had raised the prospect of
an election, barely two years after the ruling coalition was formed, by
objecting to the naming of the attorney-general, Mr Harry Whelehan, as
president of the High Court.
However, the government said, a few hours before parliament was to end a
103-day summer recess, that it would legislate to change the way top legal
appointments are made.
This row had been seen as a trial of strength between Labour, whose
popularity has been slipping in opinion polls, and its dominant government
partner which might have held up an Anglo-Irish campaign to bring peace to
Northern Ireland.
Mr Spring had said that the Labour party wanted to be consulted and involved
in such top appointments. It had put forward alternative candidates whom Mr
Reynolds refused to accept.
The dispute was smoothed over when it was announced that the government had
accepted the recommendations of a parliamentary committee set up to mediate
in the crisis and had said legislative changes would be needed. The
statement said a new High Court president would be named when the changes
had been brought into law, but gave no further details.
The announcement ended weeks of wrangling over the appointment, which had
raised Fine Gael's hopes of ending Fianna Fail's grip on power.

FT  12 OCT 94 / French tear down symbol of urban conflict and despair: The
demolition in Lyons yesterday of a low-income tower block city that became a
national embarrassment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a suburb known almost universally throughout France as a synonym for the
worst in urban conflict and decay, Les Minguettes is remarkably hard to
find.
The area seems to be mysteriously off the edge of many of the maps of Lyons,
just as it is a little beyond the end of the metro line, itself only
extended far into the south-east of the city in recent years.
Many in the region would probably like it to remain forgotten, given the
associations of Minguettes with the riots in the 'hot summers' of 1981 and
1983 which gave it national notoriety and helped trigger a range of
government inquiries and new urban policies.
Yesterday was an exception, as thousands gathered to witness one of the most
ambitious such acts ever undertaken: 10 of the 15-storey, low-income housing
blocks in the suburb that became most tarnished with despair over the past
30 years were demolished by explosives in a matter of minutes. The so-called
'Towers of Democracy', distinguished by little more than the enormous purple
numbers on their flanks, disappeared from the skyline. The recently-erected
barriers will soon be removed and 86,000 tonnes of rubble trucked away.
The destruction left many - including former inhabitants - with a sense of
relief, and marked the end of an era of technocratic 1960s urban planning
strategies. But others were left wondering whether it was all in fact far
more symbolic than useful.
Some 48 high-density towers still stand in Minguettes, remnants of one of
the 'mushroom cities' constructed at great speed in the late 1960s and early
1970s to cope with extreme housing shortages. At their peak, the blocks
accommodated 35,000 people.
Mr Andre Gerin, the Communist mayor of Venissieux, the municipality in which
Minguettes is based, remembers the excitement when they were first built.
Formerly a worker in a lorry factory, he moved into one of the blocks in the
late 1960s and recalls the delight of being for the first time in a flat
that was modern and spacious, with central heating and a bathroom.
Yesterday he said he felt mainly 'relief' at the destruction of the flats.
The problem was partly poor quality construction and management, and partly
the failure of attempts to create socially-mixed housing. Low-income housing
policy started to favour lower-density construction. Over the following
years, those who could afford to moved out: the young professionals, skilled
workers, anyone with money. A residue of increasingly more marginalised
groups remained.
Struggling with economic recession, Minguettes became one of the most
concentrated areas of deprivation in the country. Even official statistics,
which substantially underestimate the problem, showed unemployment last year
at 22 per cent.
Nearly a quarter of the population are classified as immigrant, more than a
third are aged under 19, and more than 22 per cent live in households of at
least five people. Many families have fallen behind in paying their
subsidised rents. Crime, drugs and educational failure are all widespread.
The difference in lifestyles between the older French population and younger
immigrants in the area has helped fuel racial conflict, while relations
between the police and the local youth - particularly those of North African
origin - have always been tense.
Yet even the saga of the demolition of the 'Towers of Democracy' highlights
the problems of French urban policy. It has taken nine years and a number of
alternative plans for rehabilitation since the flats were emptied of
residents in 1985 in preparation for demolition.
Mr John Tuppen, a geographer at Lyons business school, says the delays were
partly explained by political complications and persistent disagreements
over the different policies of the various strands of government.
It remains unclear whether the local community will be able to gain
sufficient political and financial support for its plans for Minguettes: an
extension of the metro, a new media centre and a technical institute.
'Most of the proposals to do with 'Democracy' have come to nothing,' says Mr
Tuppen. Even the planned physical changes do little to affect the underlying
social problems. 'Despite all the rhetoric, it is unrealistic to expect any
major change while there is such high unemployment,' he says.
Mr Gerin, the mayor, is optimistic about the future, pointing to a strong
sense of local community. 'We need to proceed with humility and wisdom,
realising that it takes time to build a town,' he says. But his solutions
are ambitious: social integration, work and greater local power. Father
Christian Delorme, in charge of relations with the Moslem community for the
Diocese of Lyons, sees continued tensions between the second generation of
North Africans and other members of French society, including the police. 'I
am pessimistic. I see French suburbs becoming more like American ghettos. It
would be difficult to create balanced communities there now.'
While yesterday's demolition cost an estimated FFr14m (Dollars 2.65m) the
municipality still faces an outstanding bill of FFr17m to complete payments
to the state for the blocks' original construction. It will be a continual
reminder that the problems of the past are far from over.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Kuchma plans big reforms for Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma yesterday outlined a radical economic
reform programme in an inaugural policy address before parliament.
Mr Kuchma, elected in July, confronted the communist-dominated chamber with
plans to privatise land, overhaul agriculture and cut state subsidies as
part of Ukraine's first real attempt at reform. The president also claimed
wide powers to implement the steps even in the face of opposition from
parliament.
Mr Kuchma's speech, which had been postponed several times, is the first
clear public indication that the Ukrainian president intends to support
comprehensive market reforms. His address is a direct challenge to the
conservative legislature and to western governments, which Kiev will now
expect to deliver on promises of substantial aid.
The broad strokes of Mr Kuchma's reform programme come from the preliminary
deal agreed with the International Monetary Fund last week on a Dollars 360m
loan, the country's first since independence. But Mr Kuchma, defying
expectations of some western observers who doubted whether the former
missile factory director would ever be fully converted to the cause of
market reforms, went beyond that text.
After outlining Ukraine's economic predicament, the president said the only
way to ensure 'true independence' and prevent 'colonial status' was to
stabilise the currency and inflation, overhaul the taxation system to lure
businesses back from the growing shadow economy, and reform financial
services.
Although Mr Kuchma campaigned on a pro-Russian platform, he couched his
economic programme in national terms. Mr Kuchma, still viewed suspiciously
by some nationalist politicians who fear he seeks a reunion with Russia,
warned parliamentarians that economic reforms are crucial if Ukraine is to
survive as an independent state.
'Our banks are not strong enough to fight and compete with Russian banks,'
he said in his now fluent Ukrainian. 'We must do a lot to ensure economic
sovereignty.'
Against strong parliamentary opposition, Mr Kuchma also endorsed land and
property privatisation only days after Mr Alexander Moroz, the conservative
parliamentary chairman, vowed to oppose these measures.
The other bold step, awaited by World Bank negotiators keen on structural
reform, was the call to overhaul agriculture, potentially Ukraine's most
profitable industry but now heavily subsidised.
'The key to the realisation of real reform in Ukraine is agriculture,' Mr
Kuchma said.
Mr Kuchma also endorsed large-scale privatisation, currently stalled, and
the decentralisation of the economic control currently exercised by central
ministries. Both steps face strong opposition in parliament and among some
ministries.
Mr Kuchma warned that he would not permit parliament to hamper his economic
plans. 'Political changes are needed, too,' he told MPs. 'Parliament cannot
interfere in the affairs of the president (and) . . . does not have the
power to act independently on economic reform.'
With the constitution unclear on division of powers, Mr Kuchma claimed the
power to appoint regional government heads, unilaterally establish the
division of power between the president and the legislature and eventually
replace the Brezhnev-era constitution.
He also appealed to international financial institutions for further aid,
such as the Dollars 4bn promised at Naples' G7 summit, to promote reform. He
said 'we cannot solve energy problems on our own' and saw a need for
external financing to cover the chronic balance of payments gap, now at
Dollars 3bn.
His speech was seen as a direct attack against the communist-dominated
parliament which poses the greatest potential threat to reforms.

FT  12 OCT 94 / German Elections: Bonn government basks in the light of
television coverage - On air, some are more equal than others
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the night of August 17, German holidaymakers who had flocked to the
Canary Islands for their vacation had an unexpected opportunity to see an
interview with Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Sat 1, the private commercial
television channel. For one hour, the chancellor, unhindered by any
trenchant questioning, covered a broad range of issues. 'This was not a
political broadcast,' insisted Ms Simone Telgart from Sat 1. 'We interviewed
him not as head of the Christian Democratic Union but as the chancellor.'
That interview, directed specifically at German holidaymakers, was a
foretaste of things to come as television geared up for next Sunday's
federal elections.
'There is no doubt television has played a very important role in this
campaign and will play a crucial role in influencing the undecided voters,'
said Mr Manfred Gullner, head of the Dortmund-based Forsa Institute for
Social Research and Statistical Analysis.
'At least 15 per cent of voters have still to make up their minds how they
will vote. In this context, the role and influence of television in this
campaign is much greater than in other federal elections.'
In the past, particularly during the 1970s and early 1980s, voters were
exposed to only two state-run television channels: ARD, controlled by the 16
states, and the Mainz-based ZDF. Since the advent of private television in
1985, viewers have had a choice of several commercial and satellite
channels. These include: RTL, partly owned by the Bertelsmann publishing
group; Sat 1, jointly owned by Munich-based mogul Leo Kirch and the Springer
group; and Pro 7, also owned by Mr Kirch.
By law, the channels are required to provide equal opportunities for
expression of opinions. However, they are not required to give equal time to
each party outside party political broadcasts.
Sat 1, with 16 per cent of the audience, and ZDF, with 17 per cent, have
consistently supported the CDU, and particularly Mr Kohl, throughout the
campaign. 'You know exactly where you stand with Sat 1,' said Mr Gullner,
adding: 'It's the Kohl channel.'
Between January and the beginning of this month, Sat 1 had broadcast five
hours and 10 minutes of interviews with Mr Kohl, compared to one hour and 24
minutes with Mr Rudolf Scharping, leader of the opposition Social Democrats.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and leader of the Free Democrats, junior
partners in the Bonn government, was given a mere 47 minutes.
The Greens and the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), successor to east
Germany's Communist party, hardly got a look-in. Mr Joschka Fischer, Hesse's
environmental minister and a prominent Green, has been given one minute and
19 seconds; Mr Gregor Gysi, the PDS parliamentary leader, seven minutes.
Neither has been interviewed. Said Ms Telgart: 'We are concentrating on the
main established political parties. And in any case, its natural that the
chancellor gets the most air time.'
Mr Kohl and the CDU could hardly ask for better coverage from Sat 1,
particularly since Mr Kirch is able to extend his influence beyond
television. He owns a 37 per cent stake in the Springer group which
publishes the conservative Die Welt daily and the Bild tabloid, both
staunchly CDU.
At Springer, Mr Kirch can rely on Mr Jurgen Richter, its new chairman, to
promote the CDU. Like Mr Kirch, Mr Richter is a personal friend of the
chancellor from the days when he was running the Rheinpfalz newspaper group
at Ludswigshafen, near Mr Kohl's home. It was that newspaper group, backed
by the chancellor, which took over the Freie Presse in Chemnitz, one of east
Germany's largest dailies.
Such support for the CDU is boosted by ZDF. According to Media Control, an
independent company specialising in the electronic media, the channel has
given Mr Kohl more than five hours of air time between January and the end
of September, compared to three hours and 10 minutes for Mr Scharping. In
contrast, ZDF has given Mr Kinkel over four hours and 17 minutes.
Some of Germany's other television channels and newspapers have tried to
provide more balanced coverage. Mr Gullner reckons RTL and ARD are
'comparatively fair'. Indeed, Media Control has shown that there is only
about 30 minutes' difference between the air time given the two main
leaders, while the Greens, FDP and PDS are given coverage as well, although
no channel has managed to have a debate between Mr Kohl and Mr Scharping.
But Media Control has also shown that on the four main channels Mr Kohl has
received 17 hours and three minutes; Mr Scharping 10 hours and 11 minutes.
'We have complained to the television authorities about the bias,' said the
SPD's Ms Mechthild Reith. 'But we had little success. Without a doubt,
television has been pro-Kohl and CDU, and ZDF has becoming increasingly
pro-Kohl.'
The election coverage has convinced Mr Gullner, and Mr Hans Hege, head of
the Berlin-Brandenburg Medienanstalen, a body supposed to ensure a wide
variety of high quality programmes, of the need to set a ceiling on
ownership of television channels, or audience share.
'Once this election is over, there will have to be a major rethink about the
ownership structures,' said Mr Gullner.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Stock market points to Kohl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Growing confidence among investors that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government
would be re-elected on Sunday helped the German stock market to make further
gains yesterday after earlier concern that the coalition might lose the
vote.
The DAX index of leading stocks in Frankfurt added a further 2.3 per cent,
or 46.3 points, to reach 2,071 points after a rise of 3.3 per cent (64.2
points) on Monday. Also contributing to the continued upturn was the
stronger performance in the bond market. Despite the positive German stock
market showing, however, some economists still feel Chancellor Kohl could
have an uphill struggle to win. 'I think his chances are slightly better
than 50-50,' said Mr Holger Fahrinkrug, Frankfurt-based economist with UBS
Global Research.
This morning, he added, stock market opinion was probably tilting to a 55
per cent probability of a victory for Mr Kohl. Now, he thought, market
opinion in favour of a Kohl success had probably strengthened to 60 per
cent.
A new opinion poll yesterday gave Chancellor Kohl and his coalition partners
50 per cent. The result in the poll by the Allensbach Institute was the
coalition's best of recent weeks.
It gave the CDU/CSU 42 per cent, 0.9 points up from a week earlier, with the
FDP unchanged on 8 per cent. The SPD had slipped 0.2 points to 34.9 per
cent.
It gave the Greens 8.1 per cent, down 0.1, and the reformed communist Party
of Democratic Socialism (PDS) 3.9 per cent, down 0.6.
Recent opinion polls suggesting the governing coalition was likely to win an
outright victory have helped market sentiment.
So has confidence about the economic recovery and receding inflation,
despite yesterday's news that west German inflation in September had stuck
at 3 per cent instead of easing to an annual 2.9 per cent as provisionally
stated.

FT  12 OCT 94 / German engineers demand 6% pay rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IG Metall, the German engineering workers' union, yesterday called for a 6
per cent pay rise next year, and flatly rejected any attempt to delay the
introduction of a 35-hour week.
Mr Klaus Zwickel, the union's leader, said the claim was justified by the
gathering economic recovery, rising productivity after mass redundancies
over the past two years, and the need to give further stimulation to
consumer demand.
The claim was immediately condemned by the engineering employers as
'illusory', and as the wrong signal for the forthcoming pay round. The
employers want the 35-hour week (due to be introduced from next October) to
be renegotiated, in order to keep down costs in Germany's most important
export industry.
The 6 per cent claim, which affects some 3.8m workers in the industry, is
based on forecasts by IG Metall of consumer price inflation next year of 2.5
per cent, and productivity growth of 3.5 per cent. It amounts to a
recommendation to regional branches, which then submit their own precise
claims and negotiate with the employers.
At the same time, Mr Zwickel defended the proposed rise as an important way
of stimulating the economic recovery, and boosting consumer spending.
'People who have suffered from three years of net reductions in their income
have simply postponed their plans to buy new cars, refrigerators, and
washing machines for longer and longer,' he said. 'The greatest brake on our
economic recovery is (the lack of) private consumption. A significant
increase in wages would support internal demand, secure existing jobs and
create new ones.'
His argument was rejected by Mr Dieter Kirchner, chief executive of
Gesamtmetall, the engineering employers' federation, who insisted that cost
cutting remained the employers' highest priority in order to save jobs in
the industry.
The claim also became instant election campaign material, with Mr Gunter
Rexrodt, the Free Democratic party economics minister, saying that flexible
working hours should have precedence over wage increases, in order to
promote Germany's industrial competitiveness.
Mr Zwickel insisted that the present trend towards shorter working hours
must be maintained, in order to create the opportunity for more jobs. For
that reason he flatly rejected the employers' move to reopen the debate on
the 35-hour week, which was won by IG Metall after a seven-week strike in
1984.
That strike secured the union a staged move to a 35-hour week and has
reduced the working week progressively from 40 hours to the present 36.
In spite of the confrontational tone of the statements by union and
employers, there is a considerable degree of common ground between them.
Both stress particularly the need to preserve existing jobs, and both are
therefore likely to maintain the current deal allowing flexible cuts in
working hours, without full wage compensation.
Mr Zwickel said that far from slowing down, the reduction in jobs in the
engineering industry was still continuing, with total employment in the
second quarter of the year down 7.1 per cent compared with 1993.

The Romanian police have arrested three Moldovans, two Romanians and two
Jordanians in possession of 7kg of uranium and strontium, Radio Bucharest
reported yesterday. The seven were trying to sell the nuclear material for
Dollars 400,000 and had been arrested in Vrancea, central Romania, following
a tip off from security services. It is the second uranium smuggling
incident in Romania in the past 10 days. Police said last week they had
arrested six Romanians, including two army officers, who were attempting to
sell 4.5kg of uranium 235 and 238 at a villa near Bucharest. Officials said
they believed the uranium had come from abroad. The arrests follow a recent
spate of cases of uranium smuggling in eastern Europe. Most have involved
uranium from nuclear plants in the former Soviet Union. Romania, which
borders the former Soviet republics of Ukraine and Moldova, is close to
completing its first nuclear plant.

Representatives of all the countries surrounding the Caspian Sea will meet

natural resources. The precise demarcation of borders has been in dispute
following the break-up of the Soviet Union. Russia and Azerbaijan have
recently squabbled over oil rights after a Dollars 7bn exploration and
development deal was announced by the Azeri government. The sea is
enormously rich in oil resources and has been the focus of much exploration
activity by foreign companies. The other interested countries, which include
Iran, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan, will discuss the division of mineral and
fish resources and also navigational issues for shipping. The Russian
government, which will be represented by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, foreign
minister, will stress the unacceptability of unilateral action by any one
government bordering the sea. Mr Kozyrev met a representative of the Iranian

<TEXT>
The Belarus government, which until recently was pressing for monetary union
with the Russian rouble, has banned its use, along with other foreign
currency in all cash and domestic transactions. The Belarus rouble will be
the sole means of payment in retail trade by the end of the year and
enterprises have to comply with the order within a week. Russia approved a
similar move earlier this year, outlawing the common practice of many shops
to quote prices in dollars or other convertible currencies. Belarus's first
post-Soviet government lobbied for monetary union with the Russian rouble
but central banks in both countries dismissed the arrangement as unworkable
and President Alexander Lukashenko has dropped the proposal since his
election in July. The 'anti-crisis' programme approved by the Belarus
parliament earlier this month plans to cut monthly inflation to 7-8 per cent
by next June and reduce the budget deficit. Inflation last month stood at 25
per cent, down from 53 per cent in August.

<TEXT>
The Polish parliament's defence committee yesterday came out strongly in
support of Mr Piotr Kolodziejczyk, the defence minister who is at the centre
of a dispute over control of the armed forces between the government and
President Lech Walesa. The committee, meeting on the day after Mr Walesa
asked Mr Kolodziejczyk to resign, called on the government to examine the
circumstances of an alleged 'revolt' by the top military command against Mr
Kolodziejczyk last week on manoeuvres in Drawsko. President Walesa, who
wants to control the army directly through the general staff, explained in a
letter to the committee yesterday that he had indeed asked Poland's top
generals to express their view on the progress of army reforms. Yesterday,
however, Mr Kolodziejczyk, a retired admiral and once a Walesa favourite,
said the president had asked the generals to vote on his record. 'Eleven
voted against and two for,' Mr Kolodziejczyk said, adding that he would not
resign until the issue of bringing the army into politics in this way had
been resolved.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Private cable operators organise
</HEADLINE>

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A group of Europe's leading private cable operators will this week launch an
association to campaign for permission to carry telecommunications services
across their networks in competition with phone companies. The move comes as
the European Commission seeks to persuade EU telecoms ministers to allow
competing telecoms networks, including existing cable television systems.
The Association of Private European Cable Operators will include Generale
des Eaux, the main French private sector cable operator, UK-based cable
companies - which since 1991 have been allowed to offer telecoms services
and now have more than 500,000 phone subscribers - and independent operators
in Denmark and Germany. The association, based in Brussels, is a break-away
from the European Cable Communications Association by private operators
whose interests are diverging sharply from those of the state-owned phone
companies which account for 40 per cent of Europe's cable connections. About
43 per cent of Europe's cable connections are provided by private operators,
with a further 17 per cent provided by local authorities or non-telecoms
utilities.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Serb-Croat deal'on the cards'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Serb and Croat media reports insisted yesterday that a formal reconciliation
between Belgrade and Zagreb was under active consideration, despite official
denials from both sides. Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic has come
under strong pressure from western countries and his close ally, Russia, to
recognise the Croatian government and acknowledge, at least in principle,
Croatia's territorial integrity. This would mean renouncing all claims that
a separate mini-state has been created in the Serb-controlled areas of
Croatia. Mr Predrag Simic, director of Belgrade's leading foreign policy
institute, said reconciliation with Zagreb would be the 'logical next step'
in the more moderate foreign policy course charted by Mr Milosevic since his
decision in August to sever ties with Bosnian Serbs. There have been
persistent reports of a secret Serb-Croat meeting at Graz, Austria, having
taken place recently.
Meanwhile, prosecutor Richard Goldstone said yesterday in The Hague that the
Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal would issue indictments next month. He expected
to begin trials in March. He said Croatian officials had agreed to surrender
war crime suspects but there was no indication of the identities of the
suspects, or whether they were even in custody. So far the Serbian
government has refused to co-operate with the inquiry, set up by the UN
Security Council last year.

<TEXT>
Hungary's trade deficit jumped to a record Dollars 473.6m in August,
bringing the total deficit in the first eight months to Dollars 2.594bn, the
Trade and Industry Ministry said. Exports in the same period were Dollars
6.361bn, up 12.2 per cent over the first eight months of last year, while
imports rose 16.1 per cent to Dollars 8.954bn. Officials blamed the August
deficit on exceptional items such as a Dollars 147m payment for the lease of
Boeing airliners by Malev, the national carrier, and energy imports costing
Dollars 136m. The central bank has devalued the forint by 1.1 per cent with
effect from today, bringing total devaluation to 14.9 per cent this year.
Denmark's gross domestic product growth rate is set to level off, with no
signs as yet of higher inflation, the central bank governor, Mr Erik
Hoffmeyer, said yesterday. 'We expect the. . . high 4.4 per cent rate
predicted for 1994 to level off to 3 per cent in 1995,' he said.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Hambro buys Nationwide's 304 estate agencies for Pounds 1
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nationwide building society has agreed to sell for just Pounds 1 a total of
304 estate agency branches acquired since 1987 for Pounds 120m.
The sale marks the latest exit from the struggling business by leading
financial services groups. These paid high prices in the late 1980s to buy
branches from which they could sell a range of services such as home loans
and insurance policies.
The collapse of the housing market, however, has led to mounting losses,
prompting large scale closures and disposals. About a quarter of all estate
agency branches are estimated to have closed since 1988.
The Nationwide chain, which is being acquired by Hambro Countrywide, the
estate agency and financial services group, has made losses of Pounds 80m
since 1987, taking the total loss to Pounds 200m for Britain's second
largest building society.
A loss of less than Pounds 50m has also been incurred by Guardian Assurance
which had a 49 per cent stake. Guardian is thought to have paid Nationwide
to acquire its stake prior to the sale.
Abbey National bank and Prudential Corporation made combined losses
totalling more than Pounds 500m when they sold their estate businesses in
1993 and 1991.
Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's chief executive, said the society had secured
new mortgage business from its estate agents but house sales had been
disappointing.
Not all financial services groups have been displeased with their expansion
into estate agency. Halifax, Britain's biggest building society, said a
tenth of its mortgage business was generated through it 530 branches. It was
'strongly committed' to remaining in the business even though the division
made a Pounds 2m loss in the first six months of this year.
The sale by Nationwide will make Hambro Countrywide, 50 per cent owned by
Hambros Bank, the UK's largest estate agents chain with 750 branches
handling 6 per cent of all house sales. Nationwide's agencies made a pre-tax
loss, after interest, of Pounds 13.8m for the 12 months to the end of March
on a turnover of Pounds 37.4m.
In a separate deal worth Pounds 12m, Hambro is also acquiring Nationwide's
surveying and property valuation interests. Hambro Countrywide will issue
24m new shares to Nationwide, half of which will be purchased by Hambros
Bank from the building society at the issue price of 50p. This will leave
the bank with a 52 per cent stake and Nationwide with 3.4 per cent.
Hambro made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 707,000 for the six months to June 30,
due to a rise in losses from its estate agency division from Pounds 1.73m to
Pounds 2.18m.

FT  12 OCT 94 / US disputes Iraqi troops pullback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US disputed claims from Iraq yesterday that it had moved a significant
number of troops away from the border with Kuwait, and warned that a
pre-emptive military strike was being considered.
The Pentagon announced that 156,000 ground troops were on alert. Nearly
40,000 troops are in or heading for the Gulf, together with an additional
350 warplanes, including B-52 bombers and F-117 stealth fighters. Their
arrival will bring the total of US aircraft and helicopters in the region to
more than 650.
The US was also said to be consulting other United Nations Security Council
members about establishing some form of exclusion zone to prevent Iraq from
conducting provocative manoeuvres in the future, a US official at the UN
said.
General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said some
Iraqi units might have moved away from their combat positions, but that
'considerable units' remained close to the Kuwaiti border. He said: 'We
still have quite some time to look at this situation before we are certain
as to their intentions and where they are moving. I am not prepared yet to
say that the crisis is over in any way.'
However, Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN Special Commission in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said at the UN he believed
Iraq no longer had the capability of using its weapons against Kuwait or any
other country in the region. He was introducing his report on long-term
monitoring of Iraq's weapons potential, which he believes triggered the
weekend troop movements.
Ms Madeleine Albright, US ambassador to the UN, said earlier that a
pre-emptive strike against the forces of President Saddam Hussein was under
consideration because 'we want to make sure that they do not do this again'.
She also said there was evidence of a minimal Iraqi troop movement away from
the border.
Mr Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf, Iraqi foreign minister, said all Iraqi forces
had left their forward positions by noon yesterday. A Reuter correspondent
returning from Basra to Baghdad yesterday reported large numbers of tanks,
armoured troop carriers and artillery moving north, but some forces were
moving south.
Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said a pre-emptive strike remained
an option if the Iraqi forces did not pull back: 'We have prepared the
contingency plans to do that if it turns out to be the appropriate course of
action. We will resolve the crisis in a relatively short amount of time, and
if that requires the use of military power, we are prepared to use it.'
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, left for Kuwait last night where
he is expected to meet the Gulf Co-operation Council. In Moscow, the Russian
foreign ministry said it was sending two senior diplomats to Baghdad and
Kuwait in an effort to defuse the crisis.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Lamont reopens Tory split on Europe: Hurd attacks
ex-chancellor's suggestion that UK might have to consider quitting EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, last night reopened the deep
divisions in the Conservative party over Europe with the stark suggestion
that Britain might have to consider withdrawal from the European Union.
His uncompromising rejection on the first day of the Tory conference of any
further moves towards European integration was instantly dismissed by Mr
Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, as 'completely out of date'.
But, with some on the Euro-sceptic wing of the party backing Mr Lamont's
stance, his speech signalled the potential for the 1996 intergovernmental
conference on the next stage of EU integration to spark a renewed Tory civil
war.
Mr Lamont accused Mr John Major of 'wishful thinking' in judging that
Britain's partners would not press ahead with a single currency and
dismissed as 'simplistic' the prime minister's assertion that leaving Europe
was 'unthinkable'. There was not a 'shred of evidence' that any of the 11
other governments shared Britain's view of the EU's future.
Earlier Mr Hurd had anticipated the intervention by warning the conference
to ignore the Eurosceptics. 'There will always be siren sounds suggesting we
can just turn our backs on the awfulness of Europe,' he said.
Insisting that the federalist ambitions of Britain's partners had been
severely curbed by the experience of the Maastricht Treaty, Mr Hurd said: '
We must resist that temptation. Our interest lies in steering Europe our
way, rather than pretending we belong to another continent.' Amid criticism
from the pro-European wing of the party, other cabinet ministers were less
diplomatic. Privately they accused Mr Lamont of being driven by a desire to
exact revenge on Mr Major for his dismissal from the Treasury.
But Mr Lamont, whose Euro-sceptic credentials pre-date his departure from
the government last year, articulated the views of a small but powerful
minority within the party at Westminster.
Some ministers - including in the cabinet Mr Michael Portillo, Mr Peter
Lilley and Mr John Redwood - are understood to believe that Britain should
not accept any further integration at the 1996 conference.
Speaking at a fringe meeting organised by the rightwing Selsdon Group, Mr
Lamont stressed he was not advocating immediate withdrawal from the EU.
But he said: 'Britain is on a collision course with its partners unless we
find a means of resolving the different aspirations.'
He suggested that Britain should accept no further moves towards a federal
Europe and opt for membership of the European Economic Area rather than the
Union or an outer tier of EU membership.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Market turmoil as rouble falls more than 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian rouble plummeted 21.5 per cent yesterday, its biggest one-day
fall.
The currency's collapse shocked Russia's emerging financial markets, caused
confusion in the streets, and prompted debate among politicians about the
future of the country's reforms. There were unconfirmed reports that prime
minister Viktor Chernomyrdin would break his holiday and return to Moscow.
The government appeared surprised by the extent of the fall and said it
would raise its three-month refinancing rate from 130 per cent to 170 per
cent from today in a desperate attempt to defend the currency.
Many Russian banks refused to exchange currency and shut for the day,
creating bewilderment and anger among crowds outside.
One western economist in Moscow said: 'It is a full-blown panic. The
challenge to the government is going to be not to overreact and to
recommence its stabilisation programme.'
The Central Bank held a crisis meeting yesterday afternoon amid allegations
that 10 banks had colluded to dump roubles on the market. The low volumes
traded on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange (Micex) make it vulnerable
to speculation, said currency experts.
On Micex, the rouble plunged to 3,926 to the US dollar from 3,081 on Monday,
taking this month's decline to 32.9 per cent.
The Moscow Commodities Exchange, one of the main dollar futures trading
floors, shut down when the Micex rate was announced, member brokers said.
Trading in shares was also affected as brokers checked to see if prices had
been updated.
Government ministers expect a fierce debate on the rouble in the Russian
parliament today.
Mr Sergei Glazyev, head of the parliament's economic policies committee,
said the rouble's large fall would have a destabilising effect over the
medium-term.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, a former minister of finance and fierce critic of the
government said: 'The markets reflect the real situation in the country;
that everything is getting worse and we have a government of mediocre and
drifting economic policy.'
Mr Victor Gerashchenko, chairman of the central bank, rejected suggestions
that the rouble might fall to 5,000-6,000 to the dollar by the end of the
year and dismissed out of hand the prediction by Mr Fyodorov, that it would
rise to 12,000.

FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais takes tough line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais hopes by the end of next year to recover some FFr12bn
(Dollars 2.27bn) of its total FFr70bn worth of doubtful loans for which
provisions have been made, Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman, said yesterday.
In an interview with the Agence France Presse news agency, he signalled a
tougher line in pursuing creditors, and for the first time quantified the
impact the bank hoped this policy would have on its balance sheet.
The bank is involved in legal action to recover its loans to Mr Bernard
Tapie, the businessman-politician, and has started criminal proceedings
against former staff of its International Bankers subsidiary.
Credit Lyonnais had often been lax in trying to recover loans once provision
for possible non-repayment had been made in its accounts, a bank spokesman
said yesterday.
But it now has FFr70bn in provisioned loans on its books - excluding FFr40bn
doubtful real estate loans transferred to a state-guaranteed company earlier
this year.
Mr Peyrelevade 'firmly hoped' the group's current banking business should
show a profit next year. In the first half of this year, pre-tax 'current'
operations produced a FFr1.57bn profit. However, this was submerged in a
FFr7.2bn loss on 'exceptional' bank and non-bank loans inherited from the
past.
But the chairman said the possibility of hiving off and privatising the
purely banking parts of Credit Lyonnais was 'only one solution among 50
others'.
He added that he was still negotiating with the government as to how to
carry out their joint agreement that the bank should be protected from
'risks latent' in past loans and investments made under his predecessor, Mr
Jean-Yves Haberer.
He again denied that he told analysts on September 30 that the state would
take all doubtful assets off the bank's books. Reports of such a move
prompted a sharp rise in the bank's non-voting shares and led to questions
from the Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB), the stock exchange
watchdog authority.
Mr Peyrelevade has so far reached FFr6.8bn towards his target of selling
some FFr20bn of the bank's industrial and financial investments, and
yesterday said he planned to complete 'very rapidly' the sale of Credit
Lyonnais' 9.4 per cent stake in the Meridien hotel chain to Forte at the
same price which the UK hotel group is paying Air France for control of
Meridien.

<TEXT>
Mr Ronald Freeman, deputy head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, yesterday warned Czechs against investment xenophobia after
several deals involving foreign investors or management ran into trouble,
Reuter reports from Prague.
He cited problems at partnerships involving Volkswagen and Air France as
creating a negative impression of the Czech Republic.
'If the Czech way is xenophobia, I'm against it,' he told an international
conference on the Czech economy. 'It's very tempting to regard the foreigner
as a threat.'
Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the trade and industry minister, stressed that the Czech
Republic needed more, not less foreign investment and said he believed VW's
high-profile investment in Skoda Auto would prove a success.
The Czech Republic has been one of the most successful of the former eastern
bloc and Soviet states in rebuilding its economy after 40 years of
communism. But while the economy is growing after three years of shrinkage,
the success has not been without problems.
VW has said it would sharply cut its planned investment in Skoda under its
policy of belt-tightening after heavy losses.
Air France sold its 19.1 per cent stake in national carrier Ceskoslovenske
Aerolinie back to the government earlier this year.

FT  11 OCT 94 / JP Morgan opens 'black box'
</HEADLINE>

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JP Morgan, the US investment bank, is to open up a central component of its
'black box', an internal system for measuring financial risks, to customers
and rivals - indeed to anyone who is interested.
The bank will make the system it uses to measure daily movements in interest
rates - including money markets, swaps, and government bonds - exchange
rates and equity indices available free of charge, even though this has
taken years of work and many millions of dollars to build up. The move is
designed to improve risk management and foster greater stability in markets
for derivatives instruments such as swaps, futures and options whose value
is 'derived' from more conventional assets.
It follows reports by industry bodies, such as the Group of 30 and the Bank
for International Settlements, which have stressed the benefits of a single
consistent measure for calculating market risk. 'This is a tool box rather
than a black box,' said Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of JP Morgan, and
head of the G30 study, which recommended the use of a consistent measure to
calculate market risk.
'We believe this is a first step towards better risk management. It should
help companies understand and come to a judgment about their risks,' he
added.
JP Morgan said the system - which it calls 'RiskMetrics' - provides a
consistent methodology for measuring market risks and data needed for daily
evaluation of risk. It provides clients with daily data on both the rate and
volatility of daily movements in rates and measures more than 100,000
correlations between more than 300 financial instruments in 15 markets.
Information will be provided through public access computer networks and
some other channels.
It should allow banks, fund managers and corporate treasurers to assess
their exposure to market risk on a daily basis and estimate the potential
effects of changes in market conditions on the value of their positions.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Tighter bankruptcy legislation welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers and consumer groups are welcoming changes to the US bankruptcy code
that slipped through Congress in the closing days of the session last week,
writes George Graham in Washington.
The legislation makes the first substantial changes to US bankruptcy law
since 1978, and is viewed as partially redressing a balance that had swung
too far in favour of the debtor.
Once the measure has been signed into law by President Bill Clinton, court
proceedings will be speeded up by the imposition of a 30-day time limit for
courts to rule on requests for an automatic stay, which allows a debtor to
avoid foreclosure on property when filing for bankruptcy.
The bill would also seek to prevent debtors from extending their bankruptcy
hearings. It would give creditors the right to appeal against any extension
of time granted to a company to file its bankruptcy reorganisation plan.
For personal bankruptcies, the lower limit for filing for Chapter 13
protection - a procedure which shields a debtor while allowing time to work
out a repayment plan - would be raised from Dollars 450,000 to Dollars 1m.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Longer reach for enforcing US anti-trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US anti-trust enforcement agencies are expected to be able to expand their
reach overseas when President Bill Clinton signs a bill, passed in the
closing hours of the congressional session on Saturday, to allow greater
co-operation with foreign competition authorities.
The bill will allow the US Department of Justice and Federal Trade
Commission, which share responsibility for enforcing anti-trust laws, to
provide information which they would otherwise be barred from divulging to
countries which agree in return to share their own information.
The US has this sort of legal co-operation agreement only with Canada.
Justice department officials credit the co-operation pact with helping them
break up a cartel fixing prices of thermal fax paper and plastic cutlery
this year.
Ms Janet Reno said the new law would 'give us unprecedented access to
evidence needed to conduct investigations of international business
activity'. In exchange, she said, US laws would be retooled to accommodate
similar requests from foreign countries.
The US worked closely with European Union competition authorities in an
investigation of Microsoft, the computer software giant, that resulted in a
settlement this year.
In that case, however, Microsoft gave its consent for the exchange of
information which the Justice Department would otherwise have been
prohibited from divulging. The US signed an anti-trust co-operation deal
with the European Community in 1991, but that was overturned this year by
the European Court of Justice on the grounds that it should have been
concluded by the Council of Ministers, not the Commission.
Although the US administration launched its campaign for the bill in June,
it was squeezed through the House of Representatives judiciary subcommittee
on economic and commercial law less than two weeks ago, and was one of a
long list of mostly uncontroversial measures passed by the Senate without a
recorded vote in the final hours before members went home to campaign for
the November 8 election.

The environmental pressure group Greenpeace has brought to Brazil its global
drive to save ancient forests, AP reports from Rio de Janeiro.
Its ship, also called Greenpeace, was set yesterday to begin a 30-day voyage
down the Amazon. The organisation's Brazilian rainforest co-ordinator, Mr
Jose Augusto Padua, said Greenpeace will protest at illegal logging and at
the poisoning of rivers by mercury used by gold miners.
Brazilian mahogany is in danger of extinction because of logging by both
lumber companies and tribal peoples. The biggest buyers of such wood are in
the US and the UK.
Greenpeace launched its forests campaign last May in Siberia. It has already
visited Canada, the US, Central America and Guyana.

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A tug of war between Poland's President Lech Walesa and the government over
control of the armed forces broke into the open yesterday when Mr Walesa
asked Mr Piotr Kolodziejczyk, defence minister, to resign.
The move came after Mr Kolodziejczyk opposed new draft laws which would
bring the military under control of the general staff, answering directly to
the president and sidelining the defence minister.
Spokesmen for the defence ministry said yesterday that Mr Kolodziejczyk was
not ready to resign immediately and implied he was looking to Mr Waldemar
Pawlak, the prime minister, to support him. Mr Kolodziejczyk is due to
report today to the parliamentary defence committee called to review the
situation.
Matters came to a head last week at Drawsko, in north-western Poland, where
senior military commanders present at an annual training session openly
criticised Mr Kolodziejczyk. The defence minister is a retired Warsaw Pact
admiral and was once favoured by Mr Walesa.
It is commonly accepted that Mr Walesa, who attended the meeting, encouraged
Mr Kolodziejczyk's critics at Drawsko to speak out. Yesterday, Mr Janusz
Onyszkiewicz, a former defence minister and member of the opposition Freedom
Union, called the meeting 'an inexcusable attempt to bring the army into
politics'.
The incident marks the first time the military have been brought into the
political arena since Polish democracy was restored five years ago.
Under Poland's present constitutional arrangement, the president has general
responsibility for defence, internal and foreign affairs; his nominees head
these three ministries. But all three formally answer to the prime minister
and are cabinet members.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Russia softens its stance on role of CSCE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia yesterday appeared prepared to back down on its proposal to transform
the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe into the continent's
most powerful security structure.
Speaking at the opening of a two-month CSCE review conference in Budapest,
Mr Yuri Ouchakov, the head of the Russian delegation, said the CSCE should
be the 'major moving force in European security' but that there was no need
to set up a 'hierarchical system'.
Since May, Russian officials have proposed that the CSCE become Europe's top
security organisation, subsuming Nato and the Commonwealth of Independent
States. The strengthened organisation would be headed by a United
Nations-style 10-nation steering committee and would mandate Nato or CIS
forces to intervene in regional conflicts.
The idea to strengthen the CSCE followed Russian concerns that its influence
in Europe was being undermined by Nato. Unlike other former communist states
in eastern Europe, Russia has been given little hope by the west that it
will eventually join Nato or the European Union.
However, the proposal to strengthen the 53-nation CSCE, which includes
European and CIS countries, the US and Canada, has been rejected out of hand
by western nations, including the UK and the US.
Mr Sam Brown, the US delegate, said Mr Ouchakov's statement showed
flexibility on the part of the Russians and recognition that its proposals
were not possible in the present situation. He said the US would welcome
strengthening the CSCE, but it should remain one of a number of security
structures. It was important the organisation continued to make decisions by
consensus among all members rather than through a leading body.
The future role of the CSCE, which was set up under Russian proposals
following the 1975 Helsinki conference, is expected to dominate the
two-month conference which will end with a summit in December. The
organisation, which has few permanent staff and a small budget, is credited
with a significant role in ending the cold war but has since struggled to
define itself or play a useful role in preventing conflicts.
Mr Brown said CSCE members were still far from reaching agreement over
'peace-keeping' activities by member states. Russia is asking for a CSCE
mandate to act as mediator and peacekeeper in disputes in former Soviet
states.
Mr Brown said that if Russia wanted international approval for such
activities it would have to be genuinely and independently invited to
intervene in conflicts and its intervention would have to be for a limited
duration and with clear goals. These conditions had not yet been accepted by
the Russians, he said.
The US also welcomed statements by EU representatives that CSCE goals could
be underpinned by greater economic co-operation between western Europe and
former communist states in transition to a market economy.
He said the US had long recognised this principle as of 'fundamental
importance' for the future security of Europe.
Germany, speaking for the EU, also proposed strengthening the CSCE by
suggesting members use its conflict-resolution mechanisms.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Italian PM in pledge on Fininvest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, yesterday pledged a speedy
introduction of legislation to prevent a conflict of interest with his
ownership of Fininvest, Italy's second largest private business group.
The promise came in the wake of the weekend publication of a report by three
jurists, commissioned by Mr Berlusconi in May, recommending a conflict of
interest law.
Mr Berlusconi hinted he was not entirely happy with the report's
recommendations. 'It seems to me the solution found is tough and inflexible,
more inflexible than in other countries,' he said.
The jurists said Mr Berlusconi could not to be forced to divest ownership of
Fininvest; but he would have to consider voluntary divestiture or the
appointment of a trustee to control the group while he held office.
By committing himself to early legislation, Mr Berlusconi appeared anxious
to resolve the conflict of interest issue. Since becoming prime minister
five months ago, he has come up against many problems arising from his
ownership of an empire which spans television, films, publishing, chain
stores and financial services.
As debate on the report began yesterday in the senate, members of the
right-wing coalition government were arguing on the need for a prior
agreement on the legislation. This would ensure a smooth and speedy
parliamentary passage - providing the populist Northern League co-operated.
The League has been mild in its comments on the report despite the threats
of Mr Umberto Bossi, the leader, that he would cause difficulties over the
conflict of interest.
However, the opposition voiced concern over the lack of provision in the
proposals for independent monitoring of abuses. The two bodies nominated in
the report - the anti-trust authority and the media watch-dog commission -
are both controlled by parliament.

Albania's President Sali Berisha yesterday rejected a Greek proposal for
dialogue in exchange for the release of five ethnic Greeks convicted of
espionage and illegal arms possession. 'They are and will remain Albanian
citizens, and we do not indulge in trade with our citizens,' Mr Berisha
said. Greece has offered negotiations on improving sour relations between
the two countries on condition that Albania set the five free and allow them
free passage to Greece. Last week, an appeals court reduced their jail
sentences of 6-8 years by 1-2 years. Also last week, a terrorist
organisation in northern Greece admitted being behind an attack earlier this
year on an Albanian army centre that killed two soldiers. President Berisha
said capture and punishment of the perpetrators would be welcomed by
Albania. He also defended a draft constitution that would force the Greek
head of Albania's Orthodox church to step down. Still to be approved,
probably by referendum, it stipulates that heads of Albania's mainstream
religious communities must be Albanian-born citizens who have lived there
for the past 20 years.

FT  11 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAA advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Airports group BAA was the day's best performing Footsie stock. jumping 22
to 496p as interest in the shares mounted ahead of Thursday's traffic
figures for September.
Activity was relatively light at 1.7m trades but traders said interest was
keen following last week's better than expected traffic showing from British
Airways.
Hambros delivered the best performance among the merchant banks, the shares
moving up 10 to 243p, while SG Warburg jumped 23 to 610p. Buy
recommendations from Smith New Court helped drive Kleinwort Benson 16 better
to 449p and Schroders up 10 to 1323p.
Standard Chartered was the star turn in the banks with the shares
aggressively bought after a profits upgrade by NatWest Securities. The
latter's banks analyst, Mr Mark Eady, lifted his current year profits
estimate to Pounds 500m, from Pounds 464m and that for next year to Pounds
559m, from Pounds 559m, after a trip to the bank's far eastern operations.
Standard Chartered shares closed 9 higher at 267p.
Persistent rumblings around the market that Barclays Bank has suffered from
big losses in proprietary trading failed to prevent the bank's shares moving
up 11 to 553p. There was also talk that some institutions had been switching
out of Barclays and into NatWest, up 12 at 494p.
The persistent bid rumours circulating in the insurance sector remained
sharply focused on Willis Corroon, the insurance broker whose shares edged
up 3 more to 155p, with a big buyer of Willis shares said to have been
operating in the market. HSBC, the bank, was mentioned as a potential bidder
for Willis. Earlier this year HSBC bought a 6 per cent stake in Hogg Group,
the insurance broker but later sold it on the Inchcape after the latter
launched a bid for Hogg.
The results from Lucas Industries pleased the market, pushing the shares up
17 to 194p and prompting most analysts to upgrade their forecasts for
current year profits.
The company's Pounds 110m of operating provisions were right at the top end
of brokers' estimates but a maintained dividend and confident statement
helped push the shares ahead steadily on turnover of 4.6m.
The feeling among securities houses is that the bulk of the axe-swinging by
new chief executive George Simpson is now over. Panmure Gordon has upgraded
1994-95 profit forecasts by Pounds 15m to Pounds 125m.
Diversified industrials were heavily traded with turnover of close to 6m in
both Cookson and Harrisons and Crosfield. BTR rose 10 to 314p aided by short
covering following the expiration of Friday of a line of warrants.
PowerGen jumped 20 to 559p and National Power 13 to 487p as institutions
continued to increase weightings ahead of the February sale of the
government's remaining 40 per cent stakes in both groups.
Oil shares moved higher, but never looked like outpacing the wider market,
eventually closing below the day's highest levels, along with crude oil
prices. Oil sector specialists said institutions had been buyers of the oil
majors, but only as an insurance against a potential escalation in the Gulf
story.
BP added 3 at 418 1/2 p and Shell, catching up after its underperformance
against BP, rose 9 to 710p.
The news that J Sainsbury had raised the stakes in the tough pricing battle
between UK food retailers unsettled the shares leaving them 2 1/2 lighter at
394 1/2 p.
Great Universal Stores closed at 562p xd. There was some speculation that
the company was about to carry out the much talked about share buy-back
scheme.
Pharmaceuticals group Zeneca fell 8 to 807p as one house was said to have
been unable to find a home for a line of 2m shares. Some dealers suggested
the shares were finally placed at 812p by BZW but the overhang cast a pall
over the sector and Wellcome lost 8 to 660p. Glaxo, also affected by news
that its German subsidiary was changing the label on its Imigran migraine
drug and alerting doctors to possible risks associated with the medicine,
shed 2 1/2 to 572 1/2p.

FT  11 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Telegraph deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The buy-back of Telegraph shares began as dealers said parent group
Hollinger came into the market to acquire 1.4m shares at 330p a share.
The block is part of an intended 6.5m share purchase announced on Friday and
the trade is expected to irritate financial institutions who were persuaded
to pay 580p a share for 12.5m shares sold by Hollinger in May.
One month after the original stake sale the Telegraph cut its newspaper
cover price and the shares slumped to the current price. Yesterday the
shares improved 4 to 334p with final turnover hitting 3.3m, the highest
since the June slump.

FT  11 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Scottish TV under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Television was one of the main casualties in the London market, the
shares falling 44 to 430p as the company warned that profits for the year
would be around Pounds 9m against Pounds 13.1m last time because of limits
on airtime sales.
The warning came less than three weeks after Mirror Group acquired around 20
per cent of the company's shares at 520p a share. There were some mutterings
in the City that the group, and the securities house which carried out the
deal, might now be looking foolish and Mirror shares fell 3 to 128p.
Mr Neill Junor of NatWest Securities, the house which carried out the
initial agency crosses representing 14.9 per cent, said that there might
have been a very short time available to the Mirror to acquire the stake and
it would be able to offset the cost of the interest payable through equity
accounting. Mr Robert Jolliffe of Hoare Govett argued that it was a long-
term play and said: 'In time the strategic value of the deal should become
clear.' Mr Junor held his 1995 forecast at Pounds 17m and Mr Jolliffe
downgraded by Pounds 3m to Pounds 19m.
Although it was suspected that the Scottish interim figures would be
disappointing, they came only two days before Mr Stephen Dorrell, the
national heritage secretary, is expected to make a key speech at the Tory
party conference. There is speculation that he might announce plans to lift
restrictions on cross-media ownership. If so, there could be a sharp impact
on prices as the market looks for the next wave of takeover deals.

FT  11 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong rise in shares in modest
trading volume - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A wide-ranging but somewhat thinly-supported rally in UK stocks yesterday
took the FT-SE 100 Share Index comfortably clear of the 3,000 mark. With the
US bond market shut down for the day, London equities responded readily to
firmness in British government bonds and to a good premium on the Footsie
future contract, although volume in the derivatives market was also low.
Most of the gain came at the opening of the session, and the final reading
of 3,032.3 on the FT-SE 100 Index, while showing a net gain of 33.6 on the
day, was a shade off the mid-morning level. The strength of German bond and
equity markets helped UK markets forward.
The market appeared unaffected by developments in the Middle East, although
oil shares were generally firmer behind strengthening crude oil prices.
Traders said that the rebound in share prices reflected an oversold market,
with bear covering encouraged by further signs of returning stability in the
gilt-edged market. The latest survey of fund managers' opinion by Smith New
Court, the London securities house, and Gallup, indicted significantly
increased optimism towards UK government bonds; a more stable bond market is
regarded as the necessary basis for a genuine upturn in equities. The fund
managers' survey appeared to indicate the impact of the latest rise in base
rates on domestic inflation.
There was little response to the day's economic data, showing a modest rise
in UK producer in prices and some improvement in consumer spending. This
week will bring a heavy list of economic data. Domestic inflation figures
will be published tomorrow, but dealers said that the chief test will come
at the end of the week when US industrial production and plant capacity
statistics are due. The company news list was headed by Lucas Industries
which rose sharply on news of higher profits and a greater focus on the
automotive business.
There was little distinction between the blue chip market and the second
line issues. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index added 35.3 to 3,482.8. Seaq volume
dipped to 488.7m shares from Friday's 512.4m; retail or customer business on
Friday returned a worth of Pounds 1.42bn. London took little notice
yesterday afternoon of the Dow Industrial Average, up 16 in UK trading hours
in a New York market moving at half speed for Columbus Day.
The strongest rebounds came among the bank shares. Retail or consumer issues
made some headway, although dealers admitted that trading volumes had been
unimpressive. Shares in Eurotunnel made progress after the first reports
disclosed a favourable trend in freight volume during the first two months
of operation.
Much of the trade recorded yesterday consisted of professional
bargain-hunting by securities houses unwilling to wait for the return to
full trading in New York this afternoon. While many analysts still predict
that the London stock market will improve before Christmas, they also
believe that any improvement should be viewed as 'no more than a seasonal
rally.' There are also fears that consumer spending power may remain
squeezed during the coming twelve months, thereby continuing to deprive the
economic recovery of an important impetus. This combination of cautious
optimism and nervous concern has caused market analysts to recommend shares
regarded as dependable, rather than those offering potentially above average
growth.
This somewhat muted confidence depends on assumptions that UK base rates
will remain unchanged until the new year. Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor
of the exchequer, said yesterday that he had seen no further evidence of
domestic inflation since his last meeting with the Governor of the Bank of
England.

FT  11 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures moved ahead briskly - for the third session in a row -
but activity was disappointing with volume falling short of 11,000
contracts, writes Jeffrey Brown.
At the official 4:10pm close the FT-SE 100 December contract was 40 points
higher at 3,057. This was just short of the 3,058 best of the day. The
premium to the cash market 24.7 points and the fair value premium around 16
points.
The premium to cash equities was substantial for most of the day but traders
said most attempts to provide the the cash market with a viable lead lacked
conviction.
Traders pointed to the lacklustre level of activity - there were just 10,657
contracts, against 13,892 on Friday - and said this reflected the finely
poised balance of opinion on where the December contract goes from here.
'There are plenty of people around who cannot really believe that a recovery
in equities is finally under way', said one leading trader yesterday.
Volume in traded options totalled 24,420 lots, down from 27,669 lots on
Friday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume accounted for more than half of the
day's trading at 14026 lots.
BT (765 lots), RTZ (765) and Redland (698) were the most actively traded
individual options

FT  11 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Attention turns to the
outlook for earnings
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks made progress for a second straight session yesterday morning,
with investors shifting their attention from interest rates to corporate
earnings, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 23.89 higher at 3,821.32, while
the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 3.94 ahead at 459.04.
The Nasdaq composite was 6.85 better at 756.81 and the American SE composite
up 0.86 at 455.98.
On the NYSE, advancing issues led declines by a two-to-one margin. Volume
was light, with some investors observing the Columbus Day holiday. Only 231m
shares were traded by the close.
Concern over an imminent tightening of monetary policy had eased a little
after Friday's employment data, which suggested that the economy was not
growing as fast as had been feared by many analysts.
Yesterday the market began to focus more intently on the third-quarter
reporting season, which was about to get under way in earnest.
Anticipation of strong results pushed many stocks higher, especially those
on the cyclical side. General Motors led the motor vehicle group, climbing
Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 45 1/2 . Chrysler gained Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars
45 3/4 and Ford added Dollars 1 to Dollars 28 1/4.
Computer-related issues were among the most active. Micron Technology jumped
Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 35 after Goldman Sachs put the stock on its 'buy'
list. Compaq was up Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 34 3/4 , and Digital Equipment
added Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 27 7/8.
Apple was near the Nasdaq's most active list, climbing Dollars 1 7/8 to
Dollars 38 7/8 in volume of 4.7m shares. The stock was helped by a report
that the company was close to agreeing a common computer standard with IBM,
up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 71 1/2.
Paper stocks were also strong. Scott Paper was marked up Dollars 3 1/4 to
Dollars 64 3/4 on its decision to sell its SD Warren business to an
international investment group.
Sprint, the long-distance telephone company, appreciated Dollars  3/8 to
Dollars 38 1/8 after breaking off talks with two regional telecoms on
merging their cellular businesses.
On the Nasdaq, Tele-Communications was marked up Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 22
3/4 , helped by comments by CRI Media Partners.
ADRs in Grupo Televisa, a Mexican media group, plunged 13.2 per cent, or
Dollars 7 1/4 , to Dollars 47 1/2 after Goldman Sachs lowered its earnings
estimate.

Equities closed 1.06 per cent lower suffering mainly from a sharp decline in
share prices of Mexican media giant Grupo Televisa.
Transactions were dominated by movements of Televisa shares traded locally
and on Wall Street as ADRs. Televisa's CPO shares were crushed in the
sell-off, dropping 13.72 per cent, or 12.9 new pesos, to 81.1 new pesos.
The key IPC index closed off 28.16 points at 2,621.63. Volume totaled a
moderately light 601.3m new pesos, on 34.7m shares traded.

FT  11 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Gulf tensions take toll
on regional markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The region had mixed feelings about the latest threat in the Middle East.
Taiwan, meanwhile, was closed for the national day holiday after a fall of
6.1 per cent on Saturday on rumours of the death of the Chinese leader, Deng
Xiaoping; this followed a 7.8 per cent fall in the previous three days,
dragged down by the Hualon group's payments default case. Tokyo was also
closed for a public holiday.
BANGKOK dropped 2.2 per cent on blue chip selling initiated partly by fears
of renewed tensions in the Gulf. The SET index closed 31.66 lower at
1,428.12 in turnover of Bt7.38bn.
The finance sector was the biggest loser and the most active, falling 3.25
per cent in turnover of Bt1.2bn. Siam City Bank topped the active list,
shedding Bt0.75 to Bt29.50.
KUALA LUMPUR was under pressure early in the day following the news that
Iraq was massing troops near its border with Kuwait, although prices
subsequently recovered from their lows on late bargain-hunting.
The composite index ended 12.21 or 1.1 per cent lower at 1,110.12 after a
low of 1097.34, with the bearish sentiment also aggravated by apparent
political tension in Malaysia when an Umno youth leader clashed with the
prime minister, Mr Mahathir Mohamad, over the ousting of a scandal-hit party
official.
Among gainers, Berjaya South picked up MDollars 4 or 15.1 per cent to
MDollars 30.50 on news that it was buying into Malaysia's privatised
sewerage consortium.
SYDNEY combined positive exploration news from a number of oil companies
with speculation on an oil price rise due to the Iraq-Kuwait confrontation.
The oil and gas index closed 29.5, or 3.2 per cent higher at 940.3, helping
the All Ordinaries index to a gain of 20.5, or 1 per cent at 1,988.0.
SINGAPORE was lower with the mood bruised by tensions on the Iraq-Kuwait
border. Heavy profit-taking in Malaysian stocks traded over the counter also
weakened sentiment.
The Straits Times Industrials index fell 27.81 to 2,302.28, just managing to
hold above the psychological 2,300 level.
SHANGHAI's A share index closed 5.5 per cent lower as last week's rumour
laden trading, concerning the health of China's leader Deng Xiaoping,
continued to overshadow the market. The index finished down 42.00 at 715.86
in increased turnover of Yn5.0bn.
Large capitalised issues led the day's fall. Shanghai Petrochemical lost
Yn0.15 or 6.8 per cent, to Yn2.06 in heavy volume of 21.9m shares. Maanshan
Iron and Steel gave up Yn0.14 or 6.5 per cent, to Yn2.03 in volume of 10.0m
shares.
In Shenzhen, the A share index fell 10.09 or 5.8 per cent to 162.99 and the
B index edged down 0.40 to 116.05.
HK stocks close off lows in thin, bearish trade.
HONG KONG closed off its lows after a day spent languishing around the lower
support level of 9,200 in thin turnover and weak sentiment with foreign
funds liquidating south east Asian holdings.
The Hang Seng index closed 36.48 down at 9,248.40 in turnover of HKDollars
2.2bn compared with HKDollars 2.9bn on Friday.
The H-share index of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong fell 30.98 or 2.4
per cent to 1,284.69 in response to the latest fall in the Shanghai A index.
BOMBAY was lower on weak buying support in thin volume. The BSE 30 share
index dipped 15.61 to 4,410.95.
Brokers said that they expected trading to remain low in the next few days
ahead of a Hindu festive season.
SEOUL closed higher in moderate trading, in spite of consolidation by
primary blue chips as a rally persisted among banks, financial companies and
low and medium-priced shares. The composite index closed 6.72 higher at
1,068.68.
Trading volume totalled 46.89m shares compared with 68.83m on Friday.
WELLINGTON ended a four-day losing streak which saw the NZSE-40 index lose
3.8 per cent, but only barely with a rise of just 4.89 to 1,992.93. Equities
were supported by a firm bond market, although the New Zealand finance
minister said yesterday that higher rates were inevitable.
MANILA's composite index closed 25.05 lower at 2,972.108 in turnover of
1.584 bn pesos, also reflecting the Iraqi troop movements.
JAKARTA watched the Gulf, and took profits after last week's sharp rebound,
the official index ending 3.18 off at 511.86 in thin volume.

Markets in the eastern Mediterranean sent a cautionary message to their Arab
neighbours yesterday with Turkish equities down 4 per cent, Israeli blue
chips by another 1.3 per cent for a two-day, 3.2 per cent fall, and Greek
stocks by 1.4 per cent although Athens was moved by domestic concerns.
Istanbul's composite index, down 1,090.25 at 26,136.56, plunged on worries
over the survival prospects of the coalition government led by the prime
minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller, as well as on an escalation of tensions in the
Gulf.
Brokers quoted recent reports that the coalition partners - Mrs Ciller's
conservative True Path Party (DYP) and the Social Democrat Populist Party
(SHP) - had fallen out over draft laws to accelerate privatisation and
improve democratic rights.
Mrs Ciller, hoping that sell-offs would rescue the ailing Turkish economy,
had made the privatisation law her top priority.
As a Nato member, Turkey supported the US-led western forces against its
neighbour, Iraq, during the Gulf war in 1991. Istanbul share prices fell
sharply in the days following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on August 2,
1990.
In Tel Aviv, market sources said that banks had called in credit extended to
the public for investment in securities. The Mishtanim index fell another
2.34 to 180.24 and turnover rose from a slim Shk137m to moderate, at
Shk168m.
The market closed off its session lows as investment funds led a small late
rally and traders said that demand for call options at that time indicated
that speculators expect a technical rally today.
Athens was more worried that a sharp rise in September inflation, to 11.9
per cent, would inhibit a fall in interest rates. The general share index
ended 11.96 down from Friday's close at 862.07 03 after opening slightly up
at 875.04.
Turnover was Dr3.1bn. Brokers said that there was intense pressure on the
market.

FT  11 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Equity markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Attention will remain focused on US economic data this week, as it was last,
while the build-up of tension in the Gulf will also inevitably have a
bearing on the movement of the world's equity markets over the next few
days.
Investors are waiting for US inflation data, due out by the end of the week
which, depending on the figures, could provoke the Federal Reserve finally
into making its sixth increase in interest rates so far this year. Some
analysts suggest that the financial markets have already factored a further
rates rise into share prices, and forecast that bourses could move ahead on
the announcement.
European investors will also be looking for signals from the German
Bundesbank when it meets on Thursday, although there is probably only a slim
chance that rates will be cut here; while the continuing political crisis in
Italy - last week's worst performer by a long way among the world index
constituents - will again cast its shadow over that market's performance.

FT  11 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt rockets up on short
covering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the weekend, two opinion polls predicted a hung parliament following
this week's German general elections, and one pointed towards an outright
victory for the chancellor, Mr Helmut Kohl, writes Our Markets Staff.
The addition of this ingredient to short covering in Frankfurt, the absence
of the US bond market on a day's holiday and a comfortable start for the Dow
made for phenomenal results in German equities yesterday, and other bourses
came along for the ride.
FRANKFURT saw its bond market stabilise, and appreciate, and the gain in
bund futures transmitted to equities after last week's gloom which saw some
pessimists talking about 1,850 for the Dax index while selling equities and
Dax futures short.
Short covering was the order of the day. Dealers said that they saw little
true investment business as the Dax rose 64.20, or 3.3 per cent on the
session, to 2,024.79 and put in another kick to close the post-bourse 70.89,
or 3.6 per cent higher at an Ibis-indicated 2,048.56.
Turnover rose from DM6.6bn to DM7.6bn. Big winners included stocks hurt in
the market's recent bout of weakness, including Daimler, up DM41.40, or 5.6
per cent at DM778.90;in the post-disaster stock category, Metallgesellschaft
rose DM15.90, or 11.4 per cent, to DM154.90.
Other big winners included Bayernhypo in banks, Thyssen in steels and
Volkswagen in carmakers, all up between 5 and 6 per cent; but there was
little respite for the phamaceuticals group Schering, up only DM3 at DM898
ahead of yesterday's data from the competing Biogen in San Francisco.
PARIS built on Friday's gains and, towards the end of the day, the CAC-40
index momentarily breached the 1,900 level for the first time since the end
of September. However, the breakthrough was short-lived and the index ended
the day at 1,898.32, up 41.94 points or 2.3 per cent.
Following the decline to a new 1994 low during last week some analysts
believed that the market was due for a rebound and forecast that the CAC-40
could well attain the 1,950-2,000 level by the end of the year.
Bouygues went against the trend, losing FFr14 to FFr550, on reports that
company officials had been interviewed recently in connection with a
judicial investigation into financial irregularities.
There was better news for Danone, up FFr8 at FFr704, as it confirmed that it
was looking at the possibility of buying the Colman's division from Reckitt
and Colman of the UK.
The 'Euro stocks' went separate ways: EuroDisney weakened 25 centimes to
FFr7.50 in spite of denying a report that attendance figures had fallen,
while Eurotunnel improved 55 centimes to FFr21.95 as the company said that
freight traffic was on target.
ZURICH finished 2.3 per cent higher in a strong technical rebound, and the
SMI index rose 56.5 to 2,553.4.
Shares in UBS, under pressure last week as Mr Martin Ebner's BK Vision
sought to increase its influence, bounced back. The bearers picked up SFr31
to SFr1,225, with UBS said to be a buyer of its own stock, while the
registered added SFr6 to SFr296. CS Holding rose SFr21 to SFr530.
Swiss Re gave up SFr10 to SFr689 with investors said to be still swapping to
the other insurers. Zurich Insurance rose SFr30 to SFr1,185.
Nestle rose SFr40 to SFr1,206 and Brown Boveri, which announced a Russian
joint venture, was SFr18 ahead at SFr1,067.
Among the pharmaceuticals, Ciba added SFr12 to SFr729 as investors awaiting
third quarter sales figures tomorrow and Roche certificates, which reports
its own third quarter sales details next Monday, rose SFr165 to SFr5,785.
MILAN saw a technical rebound as some shares began to look relatively cheap
after last week's cumulative 7.3 per cent losses and on short covering ahead
of trading deadlines for the October account. The Comit index picked up
10.16 or 1.6 er cent to 640.06.
Politics remained the driving force, but attention switched from the
damaging row between the government and investigating magistrates to
proposals aimed at distancing the prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, from
his Dollars 7bn a year Fininvest media empire.
Mr John Stewart at InterEuropa in Milan commented: 'The prospect of an
immediate political crisis looks to have been averted but the situation
remains extremely unstable.'
Industrials led the market higher. Fiat was L110 higher at L6,360, Olivetti
rose L30 to L1,900 and Pirelli was up L45 at L2,270.
Financials followed the trend. BCI was L50 higher at L3,600 and Credito
Italiano rose L40 to L1,940. Generali was L700 ahead at L38,700, but Ras
gave up L350 to L20,350, still depressed by talk of a capital increase to
finance its purchase of the Swiss Eliva insurance group.
Benetton bounced L1,170 or 6.3 per cent higher to L19,670, paring some of
last week's sharp losses.
AMSTERDAM moved forward as equities were encouraged by strength in the bond
market. The AEX index rose 5.84 or 1.5 per cent to 398.71.
Philips, up 80 cents at Fl 53.20, was bought on news that it had signed a
co-operation agreement with IBM of the US for the production of
semi-conductors at the latter's German factory.
Reports of changes in the Dutch broadcasting system initially affected the
performance of VNU, the publishing house, which has a substantial stake in
two commercial channels. VNU fell to Fl 171.20, rallied to a session high of
Fl 175.30 before closing at Fl 174.00.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Inflation worries cause 6 per cent fall in
rouble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continued fears about inflation and the state of public finances yesterday
caused the Russian rouble to fall by 6 per cent, writes Philip Gawith.
The currency is not fully convertible, and hence is not traded on
international foreign exchanges. It closed on Moscow's Interbank Currency
Exchange at Rs3,081 from Rs2,896 on Friday.
Trading elsewhere was very quiet, with Japanese markets closed overnight,
and US markets closed for the Columbus day holiday.
There was little evidence of the dollar gaining ground from tensions in the
Gulf. It closed in London at Y100.63, from Y100.225, and at DM1.55 from
DM1.5411.
Sterling lost half a cent against the dollar, to close at Dollars 1.5852,
from Dollars 1.5905. It gained a similar margin against the D-Mark,
finishing at DM2.4569 from DM2.4511.
A bright spot on the markets was the performance of short sterling futures
which continued their recent recovery. The March 1995 contract closed at
92.63, 45 basis points higher than where it was a week ago. In the UK money
markets the Bank of England provided Pounds 243m liquidity, compared to a
Pounds 550m shortage.
The D-Mark was mixed in Europe, with two of the latest opinion polls
predicting a hung parliament, and one a victory for Chancellor Kohl, in
Sunday's national elections.
While the immediate cause of the recent slide in the rouble was the
authorities' decision to stop intervening in the market, this comes against
the backdrop of high levels of inflation.
Other factors include concerns about the health of President Boris Yeltsin,
and the level of foreign reserves. Yesterday Mr Vyacheslav Solovov, deputy
central bank chairman, blamed the rouble's fall on speculation and said the
bank would not use its currency reserves. 'We do not want to help market
speculators,' he told Reuters.
Some observers believe interest rates are too low, but Mr Viktor
Gerashchenko, central bank chairman, has ruled out any immediate rise in
rates.
In Europe the Finnish markka maintained its recent strength ahead of
Sunday's referendum on joining the European Union. It closed at FM3.072
against the D-Mark, from FM3.07, after earlier rising to FM3.06.
Analysts said the markka had weakened after firm selling pressure had driven
the Swedish krona down earlier in the day. It fell to SKr4.7830 against the
D-Mark, from SKR4.76, before recovering to close at SKr4.770.
Mr Keld Holm, international economist at Lehman brothers, said the other
factor supporting the markka, other than optimism over the EU, was the
strong export performance. He said people were beginning to realise that
Finland was very well placed to benefit from any growth in Russia.
The markka has appreciated from FM3.32 at the beginning of June to its
current level.
After initially showing some inclination to buy the dollar on tensions in
the Gulf, the market now appears to be reconsidering. Mr Peter Luxton,
international economist at MMS, said the lesson of the Gulf War in 1991 was
that while it provided some short term support for the dollar, it had no
longer term effect. The longer term trend was determined by the state of the
US economy.
In Brazil, the central bank bought dollars at RDollars 0.84. This was the
second time, since the launch of the real three months ago, that the central
bank has acted to curb its rise. The real has risen, from parity against the
dollar, on the back of dollar weakness, and pre-election optimism about a
victory for Mr Fernando Cardoso.
Exporters are now voicing disquiet, and the central bank is understood to
want to curb further appreciation.
The uncertain outlook for currencies is reflected in a Chief Dealer survey
published by the New York based Foreign Exchange letter. The survey, of 38
chief dealers, found that 26 per cent expect the dollar to fall below Y95 in
the next three months, while 34 per cent saw it above Y105.
The Dollars /DM picture is similarly confused, with 37 per cent of
respondents expecting to see the dollar below DM1.50, and 39 per cent
expecting to see it above DM1.60. Sterling's recent strength is expected to
continue, with 55 per cent seeing it above Dollars 1.55.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Tapping a
precious resource - Irrigation is taking well over half Israel's water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Israel is one of the most crowded countries in the world. Even without the
possible repatriation of some of its citizens from the occupied territories,
from which it may have to withdraw to complete the peace process, the bulk
of its population north of the Negev Desert, is more concentrated than that
of either Holland or Belgium.
Together with the hot climate and a shortage of rivers and freshwater lakes
this means that water is the country's most precious resource.
Moreover, the population is forecast to increase greatly over the next 40 to
50 years and the provision of water for both domestic use and industry,
particularly agriculture, is already concentrating the minds of the Israeli
government and its advisers.
A study published for the World Bank a few weeks ago by Dr Avishay
Braverman, president of the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Beer
Sheeba, with others, spelled out the scale of the potential problem.
'Israel's population,' says the report, 'is expected to increase from 4.9m
in 1990 to 7.7m in 2010 and 12.1m in 2040.' This will be as a result of
continuing immigration of Jews from around the world and from the children
born to those already in the country.
In addition, the report continues 'the Arab population in the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip is expected to increase from 1.6m in 1990 to 3.2m in 2010 and
6.3m in 2040'. For the purposes of the study, the authors considered the
water needs of the entire area together. Furthermore they assumed and
advocated that consumption of water, at present much lower in Arab areas,
would, over the period, rise to around the same level per capita as that
used by Israelis.
In short, plans must be made to supply water to between 18m and 19m people
who will be living in an area where existing water resources are already
stretched by the current population of only 6.5m.
The implications for farmers and growers are immense because they use well
over half the available water to irrigate their crops. Indeed agriculture
was at first seen as the main problem that would hasten the water crisis.
Politicians, who once treated farmers as the most important people in
Israeli society as they established idealistic co-operatives to produce
food, began to question whether they could still afford them.
As one insider told me 'once agriculture was a sacred cow; all at once it
was just a cow'.
The value of the agricultural industry's extensive exports, of horticultural
products in particular, to premium western markets began to be questioned
when the real costs, including those for subsidised water, were calculated.
The era of free trade around the world had arrived and perhaps it would be
better business to import some more food rather than keep up the flow of
exports - especially if this would release water supplies for urban
development. That opinion is still expressed by some of the influential
elite close to the government.
But Dr Braverman and his group do not see it that way at all. 'Agriculture
should not be seen as part of the problem but as part of the solution,' he
told me last week. And he went on to explain how sewage from the
ever-expanding urban population would itself soon create a major problem if
it were not dealt with adequately.
His proposed solution was to part-treat sewage to the point where the liquor
could be applied to crops as irrigation, thereby saving limited sweet water
for drinking. The material could be pumped all around the country, as is
sweet water from the Sea of Galilee already, and farmers could use it on
their crops.
I was taken to see a pilot plant and a farm using waste water and it seemed
to work. Farmers using the treated sewage water were experiencing no
particular problems provided they did not apply it to sensitive crops that
could not tolerate it. The concept already seems to be generally acceptable
to Israeli agriculturalists.
As the waste water filters through the soil it is purified before it reaches
underground aquifers. Indeed if such measures were not taken, Dr Braverman
forecasts, untreated sewage, at present stored in lagoons, would soon
percolate the soil beneath them and pollute drinking water reserves.
Dr Braverman admitted, however, that on its own this would still not solve
the entire problem. Sewage waste water would, according to his calculations,
supply less than half the irrigation requirement in 2040. Also, to satisfy
the urban demand and the balance needed for agriculture, it would be
necessary to desalinate sea water from the Mediterranean.
He was confident that this could already be done at a running cost of
USDollars 1.10 a cubic metre of water and that as technology improved the
figure could be cut to no more than 70 cents a cu m, which he considered
entirely acceptable.
There remained, of course, the matter of the capital cost. To deal with the
sewage it was estimated that an investment of Dollars 3bn would be required;
and to desalinate sufficient drinking water a further Dollars 3.3bn. It was
clearly hoped the World Bank would provide at least part of the money.
But Dr Braverman pointed out that defence spending in recent years had been
Dollars 250bn. 'Therefore the proposal is viable and affordable - especially
now we are on the brink of peace with our neighbours.'

Brazil's coffee growers are to urge the government not go ahead with the
sale of up to 900,000 bags (60kg each) of stocks to domestic roasters,
reports Reuters from Rio de Janeiro.
'The National Coffee Council will recommend that the government does not
hold the auctions because international prices have fallen to a level that
makes the auctions unnecessary,' said Mr Manoel Bertone, the council's
president, yesterday. The proposal to sell 300,000 bags a month between
October and December was made by roasters and is still under review.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metal traders warned of
speculative sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A warning was given yesterday that non-trade investors, such as investment
funds and banks, might drive London Metal Exchange prices lower than many
market watchers would expect as the world economy turned down.
Mr Alan Heap of County NatWest Securities Australia, said that, by their
involvement in the LME, funds and banks had increased metals prices and the
volumes traded and sometimes caused prices to anticipate improvements in the
fundamental supply-demand balances. But all the evidence showed they had not
increased volatility or instability.
The impact on prices of their withdrawal would depend on the supply-demand
balance and market liquidity but in the early stages it was likely that
fundamental strength would be enough to absorb their selling. 'Later in the
cycle short-selling by non-trade players may push prices lower than many
market watchers would expect,' said Mr Heap at an LME seminar at the start
of London Metals Week.
He said that banks held metal in LME warehouses as collateral against loans
and also as a revenue-earning investment. This metal was therefore not
available for immediate delivery. He estimated that nearly half of LME metal
stocks were tied up as collateral. As for that held under revenue-earning
arrangements, the recent rises in prices had changed the economics and deals
would be progressively unwound in coming months. However, he dismissed
suggestions that this would take place swiftly and consequently depress
prices. 'A progressive release of metal (from LME warehouses) in response to
high prices seems more likely.'
Mr Heap's generally bullish tone was echoed by most other analysts at the
seminar. The exception was Mr Stephen Briggs of Metals &amp; Minerals Research
Services, who said years of high prices had resulted in a big increase in
copper production capacity. He forecast at net 4.5 per cent rise in capacity
in 1995 followed by one of 7.5 per cent in 1996. Consumption would not keep
up and Mr Briggs suggested that the copper price, at present about USDollars
1.13 a pound, would drop below Dollars 1 in the second half of next year.
Aluminium, in contrast, was likely to perform better than any other LME
metal during the rest of the decade, according to Mr Nick Moore of Ord
Minnett. He suggested demand would grow by at least 4 per cent annually in
1994-1996. Supply would be constrained in 1995 but there would be 'a mighty
turnround in 1996' with up to 1.2m tonnes of capacity being added in that
year. Nevertheless, aluminium prices in 1995 were likely to average 20 per
cent more than those seen so far in 1994 and rise to Dollars 1,720 a tonne
and then climb to an average of Dollars 1,875 in 1996.
Nickel's price was also forecast to rise rapidly between 1994 and 1997 on
the back of increasing demand for stainless steel, the main user. Mr Heinz
Pariser, of Heinz Pariser Alloy Metals &amp; Steel Market Research. predicted
nickel prices would average Dollars 2.90 a pound in 1994 and rise to Dollars
3.20-Dollars 3.50 next year. They would then accelerate to Dollars 4-Dollars
5 in 1996 and to Dollars 5-Dollars 6 the following year. Nickel stocks would
be at 'dangerously low levels' in 1997, Mr Pariser warned.
Lead stocks would fall substantially because of strong demand growth, said
Mr Angus MacMillan of Billiton-Enthoven Metals. Consequently prices were
likely to be Dollars 700 a tonne next year against an estimated Dollars 550
this year and Dollars 420 in 1993. But very high stock levels would
constrain zinc prices. Billiton was forecasting an average Dollars 1,100 a
tonne next year compared with Dollars 990 in 1994 and Dollars 980 in 1993.
Mr Fidelis Madavo of CRU International, suggested tin stocks should start to
fall from this year because of producer cuts and a 'modest 2 to 2.5 per
cent' annual growth in consumption. The LME cash price was likely to average
Dollars 2.43 a pound this year and would break through Dollars 3.50 'by the
end of the 1990s'.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: St Lucia looks for alternatives
after banana disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The West Indies island of St Lucia lost 70,000 tonnes of bananas or 68 per
cent of its crop in the recent tropical storm that ravaged the Windward
Islands. It will cost Pounds 60m and take about two years to repair the
damage and get the island's agriculture industry back on its feet again,
said Mr John Compton, prime minister, last week.
But he stressed that the country was using the damage wrought by tropical
storm Debbie to step up its programme of agricultural diversification.
'We're looking at tree crops such as mangoes and avocado pears to grow in
the hills for niche markets in Europe,' Mr Compton said.
Bananas have traditionally been a mainstay of St Lucia's economy with most
destined for the British market. But Mr Compton believes Caribbean producers
must become more competitive and diversify their farm industries.
'We plan to re-organise the whole structure of our banana industry as we
realise that competition in Europe will continue to be strong,' he said. The
country is looking for around Pounds 10m in aid from European Union
programmes to assist in increasing production and productivity in bananas as
well as diversifying.
Mr Compton believes producers in St Lucia can increase productivity by 50
per cent in fertile valleys by using irrigation methods, better drainage,
better disease and pest control. He aims to produce the country's quota to
the EU market - 127,000 tonnes - on less acreage.
But the storm caused major structural damage, altering the course of rivers,
knocking out all but one of the island's water supplies. and silting up some
rivers. Mr Compton reckons that 20 per cent of the island's fertile valley
land is irrecoverably damaged.
'The storm has set back our efforts considerably, but we want to use this
opportunity to go ahead and properly re-organise our farming industry,' Mr
Compton said.
In the meantime, the Windward Islands, which supply 3 to 4 per cent of EU
bananas are looking to buy in bananas from elsewhere to fulfil their quota
and hold on to market share. But the commission has yet to approve the
request.
Belize is asking for an increase in its EU quota to reflect the growth in
its own banana industry - the country has a quota for 40,000 tonnes, but
production will exceed 55,000 tonnes this year.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian smelters seen heading
for the scrap heap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One third of the former Soviet Union's 3.6m tonnes of aluminium smelting
capacity could be expected to disappear in the next five years, driven out
of production by high costs and obsolete equipment, according to Mr Horst
Peters, managing director of VAW Aluminium-Technologie.
He pointed out during a conference in London yesterday that, if they were to
meet present Russian emission standards, Russia's aluminium smelters needed
total investment of USDollars 3.5bn. A further Dollars 2bn would be required
if the country's copper, lead and zinc smelters were to meet pollution
targets.
Money for this purpose was at present not available in the former Soviet
Union, nor in the western financial markets, Mr Peters insisted.
So those smelters not worth modernising would be phased out.
He suggested that some of the heavily-polluting aluminium smelters could be
modernised using a step-by-step approach, which could be financed out of
cash flows with some help from international financial institutions or
export credits.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: Bunds higher as traders bank on Kohl
victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European government bond prices rose yesterday, led by the German market.
The US markets were closed and European dealing was slow, with investors
thin on the ground ahead of this week's data from the US, a Bundesbank
council meeting on Thursday and the German election.
German government bonds were lifted in a futures-driven squeeze as investors
prepared their positions for a victory by the coalition government led by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the federal election on Sunday.
'A Kohl victory is now priced into the market,' said Ms Alison Cottrell,
senior international economist at Kidder Peabody in London.
This view was shared by Mr Nigel Richardson at Yamaichi in London. 'There is
a general degree of optimism that he will be re-elected,' he said.
He added: 'The general election does not represent a major threat to policy
on supply, and any risk premium in the market is not justified.'
Mr Martin Korbmacher at JP Morgan in Frankfurt said there was now a 70 per
cent probability that Chancellor Kohl would stay in office.
'It will be business as usual,' Mr Korbmacher said. He added that business
was thin yesterday, with a total of 82,000 contracts traded on Liffe and
33,000 on the Deutsche Terminborse.
The December bund future was around 89.07 in late trading, up 0.67 point on
the day.
The UK government bond market took its tone from bunds, and on Liffe the
December long gilt future was around 100 19/32 in late trading, a rise of
5/32 on the day. The yield spread over bunds was around 126 in late trading.
Economists were searching the minutes of the September 7 meeting between Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of
England, for clues to the next UK base rate increase. That meeting led to
the 50 basis point rise in the base rate on September 12.
Mr Michael Saunders, at Salomon Brothers in London, believes the base rate
will rise another 1 or 1 1/2 percentage points, either later this year or
early in 1995. He said: 'I can't see politics playing a big role at the
moment. It is in Mr Clarke's interest to act like a central banker.'
Mr Simon Briscoe at SG Warburg believes that if the third-quarter GDP
figures, which are released on October 21, are strong, then base rates will
go up shortly afterwards.
He said: 'It is clear the Bank is in the driving seat and it is focusing on
the longer term.'
The gilt market took heart from the level of agreement between the
chancellor and the governor, said Mr Andrew Roberts at UBS. He said: 'Mr
Clarke seemed almost as willing as Eddie George to put up rates.'
Mr Roberts believes gilts may do well against bunds in the coming week, with
the spread coming in to around 110 basis points. He said: 'You have a
feeling of domestic stability in the UK and political uncertainty in
Germany.'
Mr Roberts pointed out that the figures for UK producer prices, released
yesterday, showed a lessening of inflationary pressure.
'Input prices may be rising but they were not passed on to output prices,'
Mr Roberts said.
The Bank of England is due to make an auction announcement on Friday, and Mr
Roberts believes the new stock will be long-dated.
The Bank of England issued Pounds 650m in tranches of new stock yesterday.
It issued Pounds 250m of 6 per cent due 1999, Pounds 250m of 8 per cent due
2009, and Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked due 2024.
The yield on 10-year Spanish government bonds fell to 11.09 per cent from
11.31 per cent.
Mr Simon Maggs at UBS in London said the market may have been anticipating
data due today which are expected to show a fall in inflation.
The yield on 10-year Italian government bonds fell to 12.16 per cent from
12.32 per cent, as the bonds rose in line with bunds.

Nordbanken, the Swedish state-owned bank, has decided to increase
significantly its services in money and bond markets to both Swedish and
international customers, Reuter reports from Stockholm.
'This will happen by taking over the Swedish money and bond market
operations in brokerage Carnegie,' the bank said.
However, it made no comment about what would happen to Carnegie's other
operations, including its equity brokerage. Carnegie is currently a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Nordbanken.
Earlier this year, Nordbanken said its goal was to spread the ownership of
Carnegie. It is not clear how this policy will be affected by the latest
move.
In March, Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale pulled out of talks to buy
Carnegie.

FT  11 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Korean fund aims to raise
Dollars 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An investment fund investing in South Korean equities is to be launched next
week by Coryo International (UK) and another UK investment company.
The Korean Golden Gate Fund will be listed in Luxembourg as a SICAV, which
will allow it to hold variable amounts of capital, and will be an open-ended
fund.
Coryo plans to raise around Dollars 100m, although this amount depends on
investor demand, Coryo said. Coryo International is a subsidiary of Coryo
Securities of Korea, South Korea's sixth largest securities investment
company.
The launch comes after the announcement by the South Korean government last
week that the limits on foreign ownership of company shares will be raised
from 10 per cent to 12 per cent on December 1.
'Very few emerging market funds invest in South Korea,' said a spokesman at
Coryo International. 'It is a specialist market. This fund allows exposure
to South Korea and will be preferred to investing directly in stocks.'
He added: 'You can buy South Korean stocks at the moment above the 10 per
cent ceiling, but you have to pay a huge premium.'
Shares in the fund will be priced at Dollars 1,000 each and are expected to
be offered to international investors in the coming weeks when the
prospectus is issued and the SICAV listing is approved, Coryo said.
An application is to be made for SIB authorisation so that UK private
investors can take advantage of the fund.
Coryo has invested Dollars 10m in the fund. It has raised a further Dollars
50m to Dollars 75m so far in Europe, mainly from institutional investors in
France and Germany.
It will complete a series of meetings with private investors in Europe next
week, the spokesman said.
The fund will invest in Korean equities and other instruments such as North
Korean US dollar-denominated convertible bonds.

FT  11 OCT 94 / International Bonds: GECC launches two-year sterling
offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A short-dated sterling issue by General Electric Capital Corporation was the
eurobond market's main focus of attention yesterday, in a session which saw
little new issuance with North American and Japanese markets closed.
GECC launched a Pounds 100m offering of two-year bonds priced to yield 20
basis points over UK government bonds, in a deal lead-managed by HSBC and
Paribas.
HSBC said 50 per cent of sales were made to UK institutions. There was also
broad demand from retail investors in France, the Benelux region,
Switzerland and south-east Asia, Paribas said.
'We are seeing a lot more international flows at the short-end of curves and
hence this deal and our recent deals for Abbey National and Sweden,' a
syndicate manager at Paribas said.
The launch was boosted by the better tone in the gilts market, which has
outperformed other domestic European markets over the last week, the
syndicate manager said.
The sterling market has also been supported by the current strength of the
pound and by reports that UK economic growth is moderating, a syndicate
manager at HSBC said. 'There is now less immediate pressure upwards on UK
interest rates,' he said. He also emphasised that HSBC was seeing very
strong institutional demand, as well as retail demand, for bonds.
In the D-Mark sector, Statkraft, the Norwegian state-owned electricity
generator, launched its debut eurobond with a DM300m five-year offer.
Lead manager Deutsche Bank reported demand from Japanese banks, UK
institutions and German funds attracted by the relatively high spread
'Very rarely does a new name of high quality come to the market,' said a
syndicate official at Deutsche Bank. 'There has been a number of recent
issues in the five-year D-Mark area, which has made this sector difficult,
but it still went very well.'
Statkraft is unlikely to come to the market again this year, although when
it does it is likely to tap the dollar sector, sources said.
The dollar sector saw two five-year FRN issues. Cariplo London launched
Dollars 150m of bonds priced to yield 12 1/2 basis points over three-month
Libor. The Hellenic Republic issued Dollars 200m of bonds priced to yield 80
basis points over six-month Libor.
'Both deals are tightly priced, whatever that means in current conditions.
At the moment, the market lacks direction. We are in a bear market and we
just have to continue doing a variety of small deals that may go slowly but
do at least add value,' one syndicate manager said.

FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Campari stirred as the dynasty
adds a dash of Dutch - BolsWessanen is the first outsider to take a stake in
the Italian drinks company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A measure of Campari, a shot of artichoke-based Cynar, a few bottles of the
non-alcoholic aperitif Crodino, a magnum of Riccadonna sparkling wine, and a
bucketful of assorted mineral waters, vermouths and grappa. As a cocktail,
it sounds unpalatable, but as a business deal the drinks' producers Davide
Campari-Milano and Bols-Wessanen hope it will prove to be surprisingly
drinkable.
Campari, privately owned since its foundation in 1860, and BolsWessanen, the
Amsterdam-quoted food and drink company, agreed last month on a
delicately-balanced strategic alliance.
The deal, which should be completed around the end of the year if approved
by the Italian anti-trust authorities, involves the transfer of
Bols-Wessanen's Italian drinks business to Campari. In exchange, the Dutch
group will receive a stake of around 33 per cent in Campari.
If this is an interesting move for BolsWessanen, it is akin to an earthquake
for Davide Campari-Milano. It will be the first time investors unconnected
to the original Campari dynasty have held shares in the company and the
first substantial diversification beyond the company's trio of Campari-based
products, bitters, soda and cordial.
Adding the BolsWessanen brands and production facilities in Italy will
nearly double Campari's annual turnover, which was L401bn (Dollars 257.7m)
in 1993. In 1994, core Campari sales should generate L430bn, but income from
the former BolsWessanen operations will add a further L354bn.
In the past Davide Campari-Milano has turned down other international
suitors, but Mr Marco Perelli-Cippo, managing director, says the fear of
allowing Campari shares to fall into the hands of outsiders 'has been
analysed and overcome'. 'We are more afraid of the dimensions of the
acquisition,' he explains, adding that it will take about a year to digest
the old BolsWessanen activities.
'Frankly I would have preferred to carry out a slightly smaller purchase at
first and then pass to a larger acquisition,' he says.
But the deal fits into the strategy Mr Perelli-Cippo outlined for Campari
this year. Campari says volume and turnover of its products are still
rising, but analysts claim volume has begun to flatten in recent years as
the aperitif market has come under pressure.
In April, Mr Perelli-Cippo spoke of the need to add new products to the
limited Campari range and use Campari's international distribution and
marketing network, which annually spends the equivalent of 10 per cent of
turnover on publicity, to promote them.
Both BolsWessanen and Campari have carefully talked about the mutual
benefits of strategic alliance, but for the respective domestic audiences a
little judicious spin has been applied to the implications of the deal. This
suggests there may well be tough negotiations about how to develop the
alliance's international activities.
In the Netherlands, Bols-Wessanen, advised by Lazards, has underlined the
synergy between the two companies' Italian operations, the prospects for
'international co-operation' and the importance of acquiring a significant
stake in Campari.
In Italy, Campari - advised by the specialist investment bank Colker
Gelardin - has successfully peddled the line that the accord will return
some proud Italian brands to Italian ownership, rather than deliver the
company into the hands of the Dutch.
Indeed, Campari is adamant that BolsWessanen will be unable to increase its
stake in the Italian company unilaterally. Mr Perelli-Cippo briskly
dismisses the suggestion the Dutch presence on the share register and in the
boardroom might compromise Campari's tradition of independence. The Dutch
company will have three out of 11 seats on the board, he says. This will
allow BolsWessanen to take part in 'general strategic decisions' which
affect the value of their investment, but not in decisions on everyday
operations or choice of management.
Although the exact structure of the Campari share register after the deal
has not been clarified, it seems the family of the late Mr Domenico
Garavoglia - one of two Campari managers to whom the company was left by the
last of the Campari dynasty in the 1980s - will retain majority control of
the group.
BolsWessanen is likely to acquire most of its stake, said to be worth about
L500bn-L600bn, from the minority Rossi family.
As Mr Perelli-Cippo puts it: 'The majority shareholder had already developed
the ability to handle a minority shareholder: now it's simply a question of
handling a minority shareholder who speaks Italian less well.'
Whether this is a comfortable arrangement for both parties will depend
partly on what happens in the continuing negotiations about the alliance's
international potential, the part which most interests BolsWessanen.
'Bols drives a very hard bargain,' says Mr Leon Stelmach of Canadean,
specialists in marketing and information for the beverage industry. 'I can't
imagine that Campari has such a wonderful deal.'
The Dutch company has said it expected a higher profit contribution from
Italy in 1996, once its activities were integrated with those of Campari.
But a spokesman adds: 'We don't just have a share in Davide Campari in
Italy, we have a sizeable share in Davide Campari worldwide. That's where we
would have an influence.'
Outside Italy, the companies have duplicate production facilities in certain
countries. For example, even after the deal has been concluded, production
of the Cynar aperitif in Switzerland and Brazil will remain under Dutch
control, while production of Campari in the same countries will belong to
the Italians.
Detailed discussions will concentrate on the interpretation of existing
international licensing, marketing and distribution agreements. But in the
longer term, BolsWessanen will try to use its boardroom influence to exploit
the agreement's international potential.
As for Campari, it is not expected to wait another 134 years before making
its next strategic move. It may even seek a stock exchange listing, but only
if it needs to raise capital. For the time being, however, Mr Perelli-Cippo
is content to concentrate on the latest challenge. 'After all, if you put
too many steaks on the grill, they'll all end up burnt,' he says.

FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Thai power company launches
flotation roadshow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Electricity Generating Co (Egco), which is poised to become Thailand's first
privatised power company after months of delays, will launch a roadshow next
week to publicise its flotation.
Bangkok stockbrokers said yesterday that the company should complete its
initial public offering in Nov-ember.
Egco, a subsidiary of the state-owned Electricity Generating Authority of
Thailand (Egat), has successfully arranged Bt14.75bn (Dollars 590m) of debt
financing and plans to raise nearly Bt5bn more by selling its shares.
Egco stock is expected to begin trading on the Stock Exchange of Thailand in
December or January.
The money raised is to fund the purchase of an Egat power station at Rayong,
south-east of Bangkok.
Egco also has the option of buying the Khanom power station being completed
in Nakhon Si Thammarat in the south of the country.
In line with the Thai practice of partial privatisation of state
enterprises, only 50 per cent of the shares will be sold to the public, with
Egat keeping 48 per cent and 2 per cent going to the Crown Property Bureau.
Full details of the offering have yet to be released.
Brokers say that demand for the shares is likely be strong. The Thai economy
is growing at more than 8 per cent a year, and electricity use has been
increasing even faster.
Furthermore, the pricing formula agreed between Egat and Egco ensures Egco a
predictable income because it is based on Egco's usable capacity and not on
the amount of electricity actually produced and sent to the grid.
Egco executives say they expect their company to take part in future
projects by independent power producers (IPPs), although since Egco will
still be controlled by Egat it would appear to enjoy an unfair advantage in
bidding for concessions to be granted by Egat itself. The World Bank has
therefore recommended that Egco be fully privatised.
Egat has asked IPPs to propose by February next year power projects to
produce 3,800MW in three tranches from 2000 to 2002.
By then, Egat and the metropolitan and provincial distribution authorities
are expected to have sold some of their equity to private investors.
Egat believes that Thailand's demand for electricity, currently around
10,500MW, will rise by about 1,000MW annually over the next few years.
The organisation wants the private sector to share the cost of expanding
capacity, estimated at about Bt900bn in the next decade.

FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Lower metal prices hit Alcoa
Australia
</HEADLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Alcoa of Australia, the integrated aluminium group, has suffered a 35 per
cent slide in net earnings for the nine months to September, reflecting the
combined effect of lower metal prices and a strengthening Australian dollar.
The company yesterday reported trading profit down to ADollars 196.4m
(USDollars 145m) from ADollars 300.4m on revenues down 8 per cent to
ADollars 1.53bn from ADollars 1.67bn. An abnormal tax gain of ADollars 59.7m
in the previous period meant that earnings available to shareholders
declined by more than 45 per cent.
Directors said that lower product prices were partially offset by higher
sales volumes of alumina and chemicals, and lower unit production costs for
most output. An exception was gold, where lower ore grades cut production
and increased costs per ounce.
The company has reacted to tighter conditions by cutting capital spending to
ADollars 82.7m from ADollars 138m and dividend payouts to ADollars 180m from
ADollars 280m in the nine months.
Alcoa's future earnings may be threatened further by a dispute with the
Victoria state government over the pricing of electric power to its Portland
smelter. The government has withdrawn some of the smelter's power supply,
but directors said yesterday that it was still operating at about 90 per
cent of capacity.
The lastest result followed a reduced tax provision of ADollars 84.3m
(ADollars 152.5m previously) and depreciation of ADollars 114.2m, compared
with ADollars 111.2m. Interest expense eased to ADollars 12.8m from ADollars
20.6m in the period.

Algoma Steel, saved from collapse in mid-1992 at the height of the recession
and now solidly profitable, plans to recapitalise to pave the way for a
CDollars 500m (USDollars 373m) investment programme.
Algoma wants to complete modernisation before the next cyclical steel
downturn arrives, said Mr Allan Hopkins, president.
Mr Hopkins said the recapitalisation would focus on Algoma's preferred
capital, debt structure and future sources of external finance. He would not
comment on industry suggestions that Algoma's seamless tube plant may be put
up for sale.
Algoma, based in Sault Ste Marie, Ontario, specialises in sheet, tube and
plate. It was formerly controlled by Dofasco, Canada's leading steelmaker,
but is now widely held.
The employees, in return for pay concessions in 1992, will own 60 per cent
of the existing equity by 1997.
In the first half Algoma earned CDollars 49.2m, or Dollars 1.87 a share, on
revenues of CDollars 528m.

MoDo, Swedish forestry products group, does not plan to go ahead with any
rights issue, in spite of shareholder approval to launch one, Reuter reports
from Stockholm. As a result of speculation about a possible rights issue,
the company's board has decided that the authority granted for a rights
issue at an ordinary shareholders' meeting on May 26 will not be used, MoDo
said. The shareholders' meeting gave the company authority to make an issue
of up to 4m B shares between that meeting and the 1995 annual shareholders'
meeting.
The company also addressed another subject of market speculation - its plan
to consider building a third newsprint machine at its Braviken paper mill.
It said that a final decision in principle would be taken at a board meeting
planned for November 24.

Singapore Aerospace said it planned to sell two wholly-owned subsidiaries to
state-owned Singapore Technologies Venture for SDollars 52.7m (USDollars
35.6m), Reuter reports from Singapore.
It said the sale of Singapore Aerospace Manufacturing (SAM) and California
Avi-Tron Corp (CAT) would allow SAE and its subsidiaries to concentrate on
aircraft maintenance and modification.
Singapore-incorporated SAM began as a maker of military aircraft parts, but
commercial aircraft parts now account for most of its turnover.
CAT, incorporated in California, is a sub-contractor for sheet-metal
products, including window frames, shrouds and plenums for Boeing aircraft.
SAE said the aircraft industry had been hard hit by overcapacity and the
global economic slowdown.
The purchase of SAM and CAT will enable Singapore Technologies Venture to
broaden its engineering base to support aero-parts manufacturing and other
precision manufacturing.

FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Danone looks at Colman's food
and drinks side
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Groupe Danone is studying a possible acquisition of the Colman's food and
drinks businesses of the UK's Reckitt and Colman, a spokesman for the French
food group said yesterday, writes John Ridding in Paris.
According to the spokesman, the study is at an early stage. He said it was
natural that Danone would be interested in buying an important force in its
own markets when the opportunity arose.
The possibility of the acquisition of Colman's follows the decision by
Reckitt and Colman to sell assets to finance its Dollars 1.55bn acquisition
of L&amp;F Household, a subsidiary of Eastman Kodak of the US. Industry
observers estimated that the Colman's food and drinks operations, which
include well-known brands such as Colman's mustards and Robinson's soft
drinks, are worth between Pounds 250m (Dollars 395m) and Pounds 300m.
Colman's operations would complement Danone's existing businesses. The
French group is the market leader in mustards in France and already owns the
Maille and Amora brands. Each of these brand lines achieves annual sales of
about FFr1.2bn (Dollars 220m). Danone, however, is just one of the companies
thought to be interested in the acquisition of Colman's. Corn Products of
the US and Ranks Hovis McDougall of the UK are also considered likely
candidates.

FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Japanese banks return to their
roots - Some regional banks look stronger than their city counterparts
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
At a time when Japan's leading commercial banks are suffering from mounting
bad loans and weak demand for loans, the country's regional banks are
finding business growth in their local provinces.
The Bank of Fukuoka, based in the southern island of Kyushu, is one of the
many regional banks going back to the basics of regional banking. It is
increasing lending to local medium-sized and small companies, while
increasing procurement from deposits from retail clients.
As of last August, the bank's loans to companies based in Fukuoka prefecture
rose 4.8 per cent, while lending to corporations in Tokyo and Osaka declined
6.4 per cent.
Large lot deposits from companies at money market rates fell by 5.3 per
cent, while ordinary deposits from retail customers gained 5.8 per cent.
Bank of Fukuoka's return to its provincial roots reflects a sharp contrast
in strategy from the 'bubble' period of the late 1980s, when regional banks
strived to become more like the city banks, their larger counterparts which
lead the industry.
The traditionally conservative regional banks, which long relied on deposits
from the retail level, shifted fund procurement from deposits to the money
market, and also increased lending to larger companies based in Tokyo and
Osaka.
In an effort to ride the wave of internationalisation, the regionals also
expanded their overseas operations, setting up branches in New York and
London. However, the rise in interest rates squeezed profit margins and,
like the larger banks, regional financial institutions were hurt by the
subsequent fall in asset prices. 'Most of the regional banks were burned by
market risk, then by credit risk,' says Mr Masahiko Tsuchiya, in charge of
business planning at the Bank of Fukuoka.
To tackle the bad loan problem, Bank of Fukuoka wrote off Y25.2bn (Dollars
251m) last year. It has also shifted Y20bn of its 'high risk' loans from
branches to its head office to allow the branches to focus on nurturing new
lending, rather than having to deal with problem loans made in the past.
But while some of the smaller regional banks have been severely hurt by the
increase in bad loans, the overall exposure among most banks based in the
provinces to asset speculation, including real estate projects, has been
lower than that of the large commercial banks. 'Non-performing loans for
some regional banks are the result of the weakness of local industries
rather than asset speculation. At these banks, problem loans should decline
quickly as the economy recovers,' says Ms Alicia Ogawa, banking analyst at
Salomon Brothers in Tokyo.
Thanks to the provincial business, some of the more larger regional banks
are proving to be stronger than the leading 21 commercial, long-term credit,
and trust banks, which hold 45 per cent of the private loan market. As with
the the Bank of Fukuoka, profit margins on lending to local small businesses
and consumers are higher relative to loans to large Tokyo- and Osaka-based
companies.
Moreover, with long-term deposits which were contracted to retail customers
two to three years ago, when interest rates reached their peak, starting to
mature, regional banks are expected to see a sharp fall in funding costs
over the next few years. Bank of Fukuoka, for instance, estimates that
Y300bn worth of fixed-term deposits, with an average cost is 5.9 per cent,
will expire during the current business year.
Meanwhile, a firm regional economy is also helping its business. Banks based
in provinces where the regional economy was relatively unaffected by the
'bubble economy', unlike Tokyo and Osaka, have seen sustained loan demand.
Public spending on infrastructure development has remained strong in the
regions, especially in the northern part of Japan, while private businesses
have moved into the provinces to benefit from lower costs.
Although lending growth by the leading city banks has fallen this year for
the first time on record, loan demand at regional banks remains relatively
firm. For example, Bank of Fukuoka's outstanding loans in August rose 2.9
per cent to Y3,988bn from a year earlier.
The island of Kyushu, which accounts for around 8 per cent of Japan's GNP,
has seen investment from the car and electronics industries over recent
years. Consumption has remained firm, due to the resultant population
increase. Fukuoka is trying to position itself as a city linking Japan and
south-east Asia, and infrastructure projects to create its appeal as a
international hub have sustained construction activity.
But with more than 5,700 regional institutions fighting for 55 per cent of
the private-sector loan market, and the leading 21 banks also trying to
expand in the provinces, the regional banks face mounting competition.
Mr Brian Waterhouse, banking analyst at James Capel in Tokyo, says regional
banks operating in the stronger local economies are likely to see high loan
growth and core earnings.
However, those whose operations are concentrated on the major urban centres
such as Tokyo and Osaka, with a larger percentage of problem real estate
loans on their books, are unlikely to see strong profits growth over the
next two to three years.
Mr Tsuchiya at the Bank of Fukuoka says strong ties to local companies is
the key to competitiveness.
City banks moving into Fukuoka lack the network and information to expand
business aggressively, while smaller regional banks do not have the status
which the Bank of Fukuoka still maintains within the region. 'We're thankful
that dealing with the Bank of Fukuoka still means something for many small
and medium companies,' he says.

FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Dow Jones lifts income 14% to
Dollars 34m

<TEXT>
Dow Jones, the US media group that publishes the Wall Street Journal, lifted
net income by 14 per cent to Dollars 33.7m in the third quarter to
September, helped by a big increase in revenues from its electronic
information services division.
However, the underlying profits growth was less strong than appeared. As the
company pointed out, the previous year's third quarter included an unusually
high tax charge relating to an increase in federal taxation. If that had not
occurred, the year-on-year increase in net income would have been 7 per
cent.
Group revenues rose by 7 per cent to Dollars 501m, but operating income
edged ahead only 2.5 per cent to Dollars 69.6m. Earnings per share rose from
30 cents to 34 cents.
The biggest contributor to profits growth was the information services unit,
which comprises the Dow Jones/Telerate group of real-time news services and
the business information services group.
Revenues from the division, fed by demand for its products, surged 15 per
cent to Dollars 246.6m, lifting operating income 22 per cent to Dollars
49.6m.
The business publications division did less well. The Wall Street Journal,
the company's flagship newspaper, suffered from poor advertising revenues
caused by the same downturn in financial market activity that is afflicting
Wall Street investment houses. The division's revenues fell by 1 per cent to
Dollars 190.5m and its operating income slumped 37 per cent to Dollars
14.6m.
For the nine months, Dow Jones increased net income by 20 per cent to
Dollars 119.9m on revenues up 7 per cent at Dollars 1.5bn. Earnings per
share rose to Dollars 1.20 from Dollars 1.01.

FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: JP Morgan offers free use of its
toolbox - Bank's decision to open up its risk measurement system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by J. P. Morgan to offer its Risk-Metrics financial risk
measurement system free of charge prompts an obvious question.
Why is one of the world's most powerful investment banks choosing not to
charge for a service which has cost it millions of dollars to develop?
There are two basic answers. First, the move must be viewed against the
background of the debate over the regulation of derivatives, which has
intensified as a result of a string of recent losses.
Investors and corporate treasurers have become more frequent users of
derivative products but are increasingly aware of the risks of financial
loss.
Over the past 12 months losses related to derivatives - incurred by
companies such as Metallgesellschaft and Kashima Oil - have amounted to more
than Dollars 6bn, according to one recent estimate.
The use of a consistent measure to calculate market risk over a defined time
horizon was among the leading recommendations of a study in 1993 by the
so-called 'Group of 30', headed by Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of J.
P. Morgan.
Sir Dennis said yesterday the system 'will benefit the market if we can add
transparency. If we didn't do something the risks of accidents were greater.
By establishing a benchmark for genuinely useful risk management it could
improve the market overall.'
The widespread use of so-called 'mark-to-market valuation' techniques has
made participants in the financial markets more aware of what were
previously 'unseen market risks'.
'RiskMetrics will promote greater transparency of risks, which is a key to
identifying potential problems,' adds Mr Till Guldimann, head of global
research at J. P. Morgan.
Second, J. P. Morgan must also be hoping the association of its name with
what it hopes will become a widely accepted benchmark will yield longer-term
commercial advantages, partly through strengthening ties with existing
customers.
The bank plays down the proprietary character of the information it is
offering, arguing, for example, there is nothing new in the algorithms or
mathematics deployed in the RiskMetrics system.
But it concedes the development of 'common numbers and a common framework'
will increase its dialogue with customers about risk management, presumably
encouraging the more effective use of derivative products.
Certainly those of its customers at its Budapest 'client meeting' last
weekend, where the RiskMetrics system was announced, were keen on the new
systems.
'The information you could get before was simply unreliable,' said Mr Miguel
Escrig, a director of Banco Santander, one of Spain's largest banks.
Mr Escrig pointed to information on both the volatility of financial
instruments and on the correlation between the performance of various
classes of assets as being 'either inadequate or simply not available'.
Predicting that the service would be particularly useful for medium-sized
investors, he added: 'Some banks offer this as a consultancy service but it
is a big project and it can be expensive.'
The system will not completely prevent loss, a fact underlined just two
years ago when - in an otherwise highly profitable year - Morgan lost up to
Dollars 150m in mortgage-backed bond trading.
Nevertheless, Mr Jacques Longerstaey, head of market risk research, said
firms could now 'concentrate on building good risk management systems rather
than occupying themselves with collecting data, much of it hard to find'.
Sir Dennis insists that Morgan is offering a 'tool box' rather than its
black box. 'The information will help but companies will still need to make
their own judgments,' he says.

FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Outokumpu ahead at FM557m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Outokumpu, the Finnish mining and metals group, yesterday announced a FM557m
(Dollars 117.6m) profit before extraordinary items and taxes for the first
eight months of the year.
The group said foreign exchange gains and reduced financial costs had
enabled it to lift its profit from FM130m in 1993 in spite of a lower
operating result.
It also highlighted the impact of cost-cutting and increased metals
consumption but said these were more than offset by a 15 per cent
strengthening of the markka against the dollar and generally weak metals
prices.
In upbeat vein, Mr Jyrki Juusela, chief executive, said the group could
expect buoyant conditions over the next few years.
'We can expect to register both growth and profitability improvement,
accelerating as market conditions continue to improve,' he said.
The group, which saw state ownership fall to 40 per cent during the summer
following a global share offering, said sales were static at FM10.9bn,
partly because of the stronger markka.
It also said its 1993 figures contained a FM900m contribution from
operations which have since been sold.
Operating profit fell to FM628m from FM653m. The latest figure was fattened
by FM210m in inventory gains, compared with FM17m in losses in the
comparable 1993 period.
The copper products division saw the biggest improvement, with profits
climbing to FM219m from FM29m. In stainless steel, profits fell to FM518m
from FM635m, while technology slumped to a FM62m loss from a FM24m profit.
Base metals recorded a FM6m profit after a FM28m deficit.
Reduced debt, lower interest rates and exchange gains meant the group's net
financial costs dropped to FM71m from FM523m.
The group said its performance would reflect rising metal prices and
expanded production following investments in its base metals and stainless
steel activities. Its equity-to-assets ratio is 11 per cent higher than at
the beginning of the year, at 38.0 per cent.

FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: French ministry acts to stem
losses at Eurocopter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French defence ministry is to speed up FFr800m (Dollars 151.51m) of its
planned purchases from Eurocopter to stem financial and job losses at the
Franco-German helicopter joint venture, Mr Jean-Francois Bigay, Eurocopter
president, said yesterday.
However, Eurocopter will end the year FFr350m in the red - compared with
last year's loss of FFr462m - because of lower production and extra charges
for some 350 planned voluntary redundancies at its Marignane plant near
Marseilles, Mr Bigay said in an interview with the Les Echos financial
daily.
The ministry's accelerated orders for 14 Fennec, Panther and Cougar
helicopters and for additional spare parts will only affect the group's
French division, which accounts for most of Eurocopter's production
capacity.
Eurocopter is owned 70 per cent by Aerospatiale of France and 30 per cent by
Deutsche Aerospace.
Mr Bigay said the ministry had been spending so much of its helicopter
budget on developing the Tigre and NH-90 models that it had virtually
nothing left to buy other helicopters off the production line.
The development of the NH-90 is proving a drain on Eurocopter, which is
funding 18 per cent of this four-nation collaborative programme between
France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.

FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Longuet favours Renault link
with Mercedes-Benz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, said yesterday that he
favoured closer links between Renault, the state-owned motor group, and
Mercedes-Benz of Germany.
'I would like every opportunity to be seized for Mercedes and Renault to
co-operate, be it in trucks or cars,' he said at the Paris motor show.
Mr Longuet's comments are the latest indication of mutual interest between
the two groups. Last week, Mr Helmut Werner, chairman of Mercedes, described
Renault as 'a very attractive partner'.
In an interview with Le Figaro newspaper, Mr Werner said that discussions
had been held with Renault. He raised the possibility of co-operation in the
development and production of components, arguing that increased competition
in the international motor industry was forcing companies to find economies
of scale.
'There are many things we can do together,' said Mr Werner. He rejected,
however, the idea of a merger. 'Mercedes is not for marrying,' he said.
Following the collapse of its merger plans with Volvo of Sweden at the end
of 1993, Renault is also seeking to forge partnerships to reduce costs.
Earlier this year, for example, it announced an agreement with Fiat of Italy
for the joint production and development of truck cabins. Renault already
has agreements for the co-production of components with other car groups,
including Peugeot, its domestic rival.
Mr Longuet said Renault had attained a level of quality which made it an
acceptable partner for Mercedes.
The French government is launching a partial privatisation of Renault, which
will bring its shareholding down from 80 per cent to just above 50 per cent.
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has said that a complete
privatisation must await the formation of industrial partnerships which can
secure Renault's position in the international industry.
Analysts expect strong demand for shares in Renault's flotation, partly
because of the limited nature of the operation and the strong performance of
the company.
In an interview in the weekly magazine, La Synthese Financiere, Mr Louis
Schweitzer, Renault chairman, repeated his prediction that the group would
see a sharp increase in profits this year. In 1993, Renault reported profits
of FFr1.07bn (Dollars 200m).

<TEXT>
Ontario Hydro, a Canadian electric power utility, is considering cutting
staff by at least 2,000 in 1995, on top of reductions totalling 10,500 in
1993-94.
The utility said its projected CDollars 700m (USDollars 522.3m) profit for
1994 and estimated results for 1995 to 1997 fall short of its debt service
and repayment commitments, intensifying cost reduction pressures.
The cuts will fall most heavily on the nuclear power division.

FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais chases bad loans

<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais hopes by the end of next year to recover some FFr12bn
(Dollars 2.27bn) of its total FFr70bn worth of doubtful loans for which
provisions have been made, Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman, said yesterday.
In an interview with Agence France Presse, he signalled a tougher line in
pursuing creditors and for the first time quantified the impact the bank
hoped this policy will have on its balance sheet.
The bank is involved in legal action to recover its loans to Mr Bernard
Tapie, the businessman-politician, and has started criminal proceedings
against former staff of its International Bankers subsidiary.
Credit Lyonnais had often been lax in trying to recover loans once provision
for possible non-repayment had been made, a spokesman said yesterday. But it
now has FFr70bn in provisioned loans on its books - excluding FFr40bn
doubtful real estate loans transferred to a state-guaranteed company earlier
this year.
Mr Peyrelevade 'firmly hoped' the group's current banking business should
show a profit next year. In the first half of this year, pre-tax 'current'
operations produced a FFr1.57bn profit.

FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Four Polish banks plan merger
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The consolidation of Poland's fragmented banking sector moved forward
yesterday when four state-owned banks signed a letter of intent to merge
their operations.
The four, the Bank Zachodni in Wroclaw, the Bank Depozytowo Kredytowy in
Lublin, the Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy in Lodz and the Pomorski Bank
Kredytowy in Szczecin, have established a committee to report on the issue
by the end of next month.
The move comes after state sector banks were told by the government to find
partners as part of the privatisation process. It leaves Bank Gdanski as the
only bank of the nine hived off from the central bank in 1989 without a
merger deal in sight.
The four banks are among Poland's 10 largest banks. The merger would give
them a capital base worth 8,175.5bn zlotys (Dollars 362m), making them the
second largest bank in the country. Their combined balance sheet at the end
of June was worth 112,313bn zlotys and amounted to 11 per cent of the
banking system.
At the weekend, the Bank Zachodni, acting in its own right, purchased the
small private Market Bank in Poznan for 6.1bn zlotys.
Mr Krzysztof Kalicki, deputy finance minister responsible for the banking
sector, yesterday said the Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy (PBH) in Krakow would
be sold through the Warsaw stock exchange on January 14. He said one more
bank would be privatised during the year in a process which is to run until
1997.

FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Kone to purchase US elevator
group for Dollars 280m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kone, the world's third largest elevators group, has agreed to buy
Montgomery Elevator of the US for Dollars 280m in a large expansion of its
North American business.
Montgomery, based in Moline, Illinois, is the fourth largest supplier of
elevators and escalators in the US with annual sales of Dollars 400m and
3,800 employees.
Dr Gerhard Wendt, Kone president, said the acquisition - the biggest it has
made - would assist Kone in its 'long-term goal of becoming a major force in
the important North American elevator market'.
It will double Kone's North American market share to about 20 per cent while
increasing the North American share of group sales from less than 10 per
cent to about 25 per cent.
The purchase follows a disposal programme which has concentrated Kone's
operations on its core lifts business. Over the last 12 months it has sold
MacGregor-Navire, a supplier of shipboard cargo handling equipment, Kone
Cranes and Kone Wood.
It is a clear sign of commitment to the business by the Herlin family, which
controls about 40 per cent of Kone's capital and 70 per cent of the votes.
In May, there was speculation that the Herlins intended to sell out after
talks with Germany's Thyssen Group.
Montgomery Elevator has five factories in four US states - Illinois, Kansas,
Arkansas and Texas - and nearly 170 branches and sub-branches throughout the
country.
Kone plans to merge its own Kentucky-based Armor Elevator unit with
Montgomery to maximise synergy benefits. It wants to lift Montgomery's
annual profits to Dollars 25m-Dollars 35m from Dollars 15m-Dollars 20m.
Dr Wendt said the two companies operations fitted well geographically, with
Chicago and California the only large areas of overlap. 'Montgomery should
fit into our international organisation like a hand in a glove,' he said.
The purchase expands Kone's maintenance business, which it has relied on to
maintain profitability at a time of a sluggish growth in new elevator sales.
Montgomery maintains 48,000 elevators and escalators, taking Kone's total
number of units under maintenance to 410,000.
Montgomery and Kone have operated a joint venture in Canada since 1985. Mr
Dan Blount, Montgomery president, said: 'During ten years of working closely
with Kone personnel in Canada, we felt our companies were a good match in
terms of corporate philosophy and ways of doing business. Becoming part of
Kone is the best assurance for Montgomery's continued success in this tough
international marketplace.'
Last year Kone achieved a FM328m (Dollars 61m) profit after financial items,
on sales of FM10.8bn.

FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Strong improvement at Kemira
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kemira, the Finnish state-owned chemicals group, yesterday announced a
strong improvement in interim pre-tax profits ahead of the international
share issue which it launches next week.
Profits before extraordinary items and taxes amounted to FM279m (Dollars
51.7m) in the first eight months, compared with FM153m in the same period in
1993.
Cost-cutting, volume increases, and reduced financial expenses more than
offset the impact of a stronger markka and low titanium dioxide prices.
Kemira, Finland's eighth largest company by sales, will launch its share
issue next Monday, the day after the Finnish voters are expected to approve
EU membership in a national referendum. The move, part of an initial public
offering, will cut state-ownership to as little as 71 per cent from 100 per
cent in line with the government's plans to widen ownership in state-owned
companies.
Up to 35m shares will be offered, with indicative pricing in the range of
FM37 to FM44 per share.
Proceeds will be used to reduce net debt to FM6.4bn from FM7.9bn and lower
gearing to 167 per cent from 321 per cent.
The issue is being timed to reflect a cyclical upturn in many of the group's
main businesses and its return to profit in 1993 after two years of losses.
Kemira expects its 1994 figures to be 'significantly better' than last year
when pre-tax profits before extraordinary items amounted to FM101m. Figures
in the final four months would reflect higher titanium dioxide prices, it
said.
A 10 per cent strengthening in the markka reduced sales to FM7.98bn in the
first eight months from FM8.18bn. Excluding currency factors, the figure was
4 per cent higher. Operating profit was 15 per cent higher at FM707m while
financial expenses dropped to FM428m from FM460m.
Kemira Agro, the group's biggest division, saw a 10 per cent drop in sales
to FM3.64bn due to lower agrochemicals sales, the transfer of some
businesses to the chemicals division, and the stronger markka. The
division's operating profits were 25 per cent higher at FM226m.
The best performance came from the chemicals division where sales were up 15
per cent and operating profits were 40 per cent higher. The unit benefited
from strong demand from the pulp and paper and water treatment sectors.
Net income after taxes dropped to FM167m from FM282m and income per share
fell to FM2.48 from FM3.69.
The fall reflects the change in the company's tax position following the
full utilisation of tax losses carried forward in Finland.

FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: MAN press distributors merge to
boost sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eight mainly family-owned businesses in six European countries have merged
their operations into a new company which will distribute printing equipment
across the continent for German press manufacturer MAN Roland
Druckmaschinen.
All the companies forming the new Omnigraph group in the Netherlands already
distribute MAN Roland equipment but hope to enhance their combined market
position. The new group with have annual sales of Fl 630m (Dollars 364.1m).
The Omnigraph deal, concluded at the end of last month, will provide MAN
Roland with a commonly-owned chain of distributors similar to that used by
its main competitor, Heidelberger of Germany.
The move follows the merger in The Netherlands last year of three paper
companies - KNP, Buhrman-Tetterode and VRG Group - which left the enlarged
company, KNP BT, with interests in both MAN Roland and Heidelberger
distributors.
This deal gave KNP BT an 80 per cent share of its market in Belgium and The
Netherlands. The European Commission gave the company until the end of this
year to dispose of one of its interests.
In a complex series of moves concluded by the formation of Omnigraph, KNP BT
also sold its interests in two distributors of Heidelberger equipment in
Hong Kong and South Korea earlier this year.
KNP BT will have a seat on the advisory board of Omnigraph but will play no
executive role. Omnigraph's shareholders believe the new company stands more
chance of a stock market flotation than the individual businesses on their
own.
Omnigraph hopes exposure to more markets will help it to weather the
cyclical demand for printing equipment. The company also plans to increase
sales of items like rollers, inks and plates.

Worms, the French holding company, yesterday reported consolidated profits
of FFr381m (Dollars 72.15m) for the first half of 1994, compared with
FFr362m in the first half of last year.
The contribution from the parent company was down to FFr11m from FFr106m.
The reduction was offset by a 44 per cent increase in profits from
subsidiaries, which jumped to FFr370m against FFr256m last time.
Turnover at Athena Assurance, its insurance subsidiary, rose 11 per cent to
FFr8.1bn, giving a profit of FFr277m against FFr217m. Largest growth came
from increased life assurance business.
Profits at Demachy Worms, the group's banking holding, fell to FFr30m from
FFr44m, which it said was explained by provisions in a subsidiary in
relation to the declining financial markets.
Compagnie Nationale de Navigation, its shipping unit, posted a loss of
FFr69m compared with FFr41m.

FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Lufthansa sees gains from Thai
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lufthansa, the newly-privatised German airline, said its profits should
start to benefit next year from the cargo and passenger freight deal signed
yesterday with Thai Airways International.
At a time when Lufthansa is returning to the black - it posted its first
profit for five years in the first half of 1994 - analysts said the alliance
with Thai, foreshadowed earlier this month, should bring considerable cost
savings. It also showed the strength of Lufthansa's ambitions in south-east
Asia, with more deals expected.
Mr Jurgen Weber, Lufthansa's chairman, said the link with Thai should lead
to an improvement of at least DM10m (Dollars 6.4m) in net profits in the
first full year of co-operation. The tie-up begins next spring. Mr Michael
Broeker, head of German equity research at Nomura International, said the
figure could be about DM20m. First-half pre-tax profits totalled DM105m
against a DM221m loss in the same period of 1993.
Mr Weber did not rule out the possibility of a share exchange between the
airlines. 'If this (the co-operation deal) is successful, then such an
exchange of equity is possible.' However, Lufthansa said it was not the
airline's usual policy to take stakes in airlines with which it was
co-operating.
Both Lufthansa and Thai are linked with United Airlines of the US through
co-operation agreements, and the German company said the three carriers
would be running what it called 'the world's largest international network
of air services'. Mr Weber said the Thai deal would enable both companies to
offer new destinations, with joint flight bookings, increased flight
frequencies and new connecting services.
'Given the importance of Asia, I think it's a very important strategic move
by Lufthansa,' said Mr Julius Maldutis, airlines analyst at Salomon
Brothers. 'The big savings are in cost-avoidance.' Both he and Mr Broeker
saw potential in the fast-growing freight market, with Lufthansa saying the
intention was to make Bangkok the leading cargo hub for the Asia-Pacific
region.
Lufthansa would not comment on speculation that further deals were likely in
Asia, possibly in China or with Garuda of Indonesia. But Mr Broeker said:
'The next step is definitely coming in this market.' Lufthansa has limited
co-operation deals with Cathay Pacific on freight, Japan Air Lines on
passengers and Garuda on technical support.

Heart of Midlothian is asking its supporters for funds to strengthen the
playing squad in an attempt to re-establish the Edinburgh football club as
one of the Scottish Premier League's leading lights.
Hearts is launching an issue of Club shares, which carry a range of benefits
but no voting rights, and aims to raise up to Pounds 1.5m after expenses -
estimated at Pounds 350,000 - for fresh players. Any further proceeds will
be used for general on-going development of the core business.
Mr Chris Robinson, chairman, said that as well as team strengthening 'we
believe that the expansion of the commercial activities are key to the
future success of the club'.
Club shares are available in blocks of 200 at Pounds 250 per block - 125p
per share - until November 15. New shareholders will have the right to
appoint two new directors to the board.

FT  11 OCT 94 / UK Company News: No Adviser the magician's rival / A look at
the role played by in-house financial teams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ask mergers and acquisitions professionals to name their firm's toughest
rival and they reply as if in one voice: 'My biggest competitor is No
Adviser.'
They mean the in-house team at a potential corporate client which handles
deals without calling on, and paying, a financial adviser.
If 'no adviser' was included in the M&amp;A league tables, it would soar above
the likes of Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and SG Warburg which usually vie
for the top positions.
Imperial Chemical Industries has perhaps the most active in-house
acquisition team. The 'A-team' has handled 600 transactions over the last 10
years.
'We've done more deals than Warburg, Schroders and Goldman Sachs,' says Mr
John Dewhurst, group manager of planning and acquisitions. 'We've done more
deals than all of them put together.'
Mr Dewhurst is convinced of the virtues of the ICI approach. 'We believe we
can do everything a merchant bank can do. If you know what you are doing,
you can save a lot of money and probably get a better deal.'
Some investment bankers concede that in-house teams have advantages. 'They
will know exactly what the company wants,' says a UK corporate finance head.
'It's a real headache.'
Developing an internal department for corporate development may not be
cost-effective for smaller companies; but those the size of ICI,
Rhone-Poulenc, Unilever and British Petroleum have found it makes business
sense.
Last Christmas, when Mr Dewhurst was discussing his annual bonus, he
calculated how much ICI would have had to pay had it used external advisers:
Pounds 12.5m. ICI pays ICI salaries to the A-team. Mr Dewhurst says the
overall cost is vastly less: 'Take off a couple of zeros.'
Investment bankers respond that a company gets what it pays for.
An in-house team does not have the broad perspective of an investment bank.
It is often unfamiliar with sectors outside its core competence. Most
companies have to turn outside to arrange financing.
Nor can a company handle a flotation or a takeover alone. Lasmo paid Pounds
16m in fees to Schroders, Goldman Sachs and NatWest Markets to fend off the
Pounds 1.6bn hostile takeover bid by Enterprise Oil.
One investment banker, scoffing at ICI's claims not to use advisers, jokes
that the group paid a decade's worth of fees on the demerger of Zeneca.
A straightforward 'vanilla' deal with other companies in a sector is another
matter. 'We've lived with other chemical companies, we've grown up with
them, we measure them,' says Mr Dewhurst. 'Our database is better than an
investment bank's' A sizeable multinational also has the resources to
finance an individual acquisition internally.
That said, few multinationals have followed the ICI approach. More have
opted for a halfway house: an in-house corporate development department
which farms out work it cannot efficiently do alone.
One manifestation is that fees for complex work have held firmer than those
for plain 'vanilla' transactions. 'Clients are happy to pay fees when they
can see that a banker has added real value,' says Mr Jim Downing, of Lehman
Brothers.
The head of ICI's A-team tells investment bankers the same thing: 'If you
bring something to me and you bring added value then we will pay you for
it.' But Mr Dewhurst adds: 'In the last 10 years, with one exception, we
haven't paid any merchant bank.'
One, after its suggestions had been rejected one time too many, asked: 'Are
we wasting our time?'
Sanguine bankers maintain there is nothing startling about corporate clients
maintaining A-teams. 'I don't think it's a new rash,' says Mr David Verey,
chairman of Lazard Brothers, the UK merchant bank.
Nevertheless the character of the 1990s' wave of M&amp;A has had an impact.
Strategic rather than financial logic is the driving force and core
competence rather than diversification the catchword.
That does lead companies to dispose of peripheral businesses and usually to
make use of an investment bank's wide range of contacts to do so. But when
such companies look for targets and alliances they increasingly concentrate
on their own sector. The more intimately they know the industry, the less
they need financial advisers.
Corporate clients are also catching up with the investment banking
techniques that once dazzled them.
'People used to say these guys are magicians,' says an M&amp;A specialist at a
US investment bank. 'Today you can walk in and find that a company knows
more about the market than you do. The more sophisticated the client base
has become, the more sophisticated we have had to become.'
Most importantly, multinationals have broadened their horizons and are
increasingly comfortable with cross-border deals, at least those within
their sector and the developed world.
'It would be mad to compete with that,' says Mr Will Samuel, head of
corporate finance at J Henry Schroder Wagg, the UK merchant bank. 'We should
move to where we can add value.'
Investment banks are fleeing forward. Mr Samuel says: 'Investment banking is
about competing in areas which are changing rapidly, be they products,
countries or industries. BAT Industries provides an illustration. BAT
handles most of its acquisitions internally but made an exception for its
east European acquisitions, on which it hired Schroders as adviser.
In the US and UK, in-house acquisition teams may represent a challenge; but
on the Continent investment banks can win clients among companies which have
never used financial advisers.
'My biggest competitor may be No Adviser,' says an executive at a US
investment bank in London. 'But it is going after that market that is most
interesting.'

FT  11 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Clinton buys in time to boost Christmas
sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clinton Cards added 86 shops to its chain of 277 greeting card and gift
stores in a Pounds 3.5m purchase announced yesterday alongside its interim
results.
The group, which is controlled by the Lewin family, claims that the
acquisition from its principal card supplier, Hallmark, the UK arm of the US
group, lifts its share of the UK greetings card market from 7.5 per cent to
9 per cent.
The acquisition will lead to the closure of more than 12 stores where
Hallmark shops compete with Clinton Cards in England and Wales. 'It
basically takes a competitor out of the high street,' said Mr Clinton Lewin,
managing director.
Pre-tax losses deepened from Pounds 956,000 to Pounds 2.19m while turnover
edged up from Pounds 32.1m to Pounds 32.7m in the six months to July 30. An
interim deficit is normal because the chain makes a large proportion of its
profits in the Christmas period.
The group blamed weak consumer confidence for a 4 per cent drop in
like-for-like sales and a 'disappointing' operating loss of Pounds 1.98m
(Pounds 770,000). In June the shares fell 31p to 105p after the company
warned that profits were unlikely to exceed last year's Pounds 3m.
Hallmark's 86 shops incurred a loss of Pounds 345,000 last year on turnover
of Pounds 21.1m. The purchase, which includes Pounds 2.7m of stock, will be
completed before Christmas trading begins.
A cash consideration will be paid over four and a quarter years without
interest, with annual repayments linked to Clinton's purchase of Hallmark
goods. Gearing stood at about 60 per cent at the period end.
Losses per share emerged at 8.4p (3.66p) and the interim dividend is
unchanged at 1.6p.
COMMENT
Clinton Cards' acquisition of the Hallmark shops seems to make sense for the
card retailer. The stores should need little work to fixtures and fittings,
and will be trading for Clinton over the busy Christmas period. Moreover,
Clinton's repayments are attractively linked to its demand for Hallmark
goods over the next four years. The interim results are worse than last
year, but are not as gloomy as expected after this summer's profits warning.
The group is thought to have improved cost control and should be in a good
position to benefit when consumer confidence returns. Analysts forecast
pre-tax profits of about Pounds 2m for the year, which gives a prospective
multiple of 13.7 on yesterday's close of 103p, up 2p. For those confident of
an upturn in consumer spending, the shares have scope for further recovery.

FT  11 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Hamleys achieves strong growth to Pounds
0.68m midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Hamleys, the self-styled 'finest toyshop in the world'
which floated in May, jumped from Pounds 115,000 to Pounds 676,000 in the
half-year to July 30, on turnover up 16 per cent from Pounds 7.67m to Pounds
8.91m.
With operating profits up 46 per cent at Pounds 858,000 (Pounds 588,000),
the operating margin grew from 7.7 to 9.6 per cent. Mr Howard Dyer,
chairman, ascribed this growth to increased sales, greater productivity per
employee, and 'that small business mentality where you watch every penny'.
He hoped the profits rise was 'an outperformance' of City expectations,
though the shares were unchanged at 168p. The flotation price was 185p.
Mr Dyer said the store in London's Regent Street, which accounts for 75 per
cent of group sales, was seeing the results of the refurbishment completed
in June 1993. Sales in the store increased by 14 per cent.
The satellite operations - shops in Covent Garden and Heathrow's Terminal 4
 -performed well. Mr Dyer said that, aided by the duty free impact, the
company had been able to sell more expensive items in the airport. He
suggested that Hamleys would look to European airports and Far and Middle
Eastern franchises for expansion in the next two to four years. Also, once
passengers could use the Channel Tunnel, the shop at the entrance would
open.
Between April and June a further seven House of Toys concessions opened
within House of Fraser stores: another 16 will open for the six-week run-up
to Christmas. Mr Dyer said that 95 per cent of HoF toy sales came in the
second half, against 60 per cent for the Regent Street store, which relied
far more heavily on tourists.
Extra House of Toys stock totalled Pounds 500,000, though currently Hamleys
had 'small cash reserves'. With the float proceeds, long-term debt was wiped
out and the interest charge fell to Pounds 182,000 (Pounds 473,000).
Earnings per share were 2.7p, against 0.5p, or 1.5p pro forma. The maiden
interim dividend is 2p.

FT  11 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Eastern Group sheds 450 jobs in restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eastern Group, the biggest of the 12 regional electricity companies in
England and Wales, is cutting 450 jobs and investing Pounds 500m in its
distribution network as part of a wide-ranging reorganisation revealed
yesterday.
The announcement brings to more than 4,000 the number of planned job cuts in
the sector since the electricity regulator called for a reduction in
distribution prices in an industry review in August.
The job cuts and reorganisation are expected to bring annual savings of
about Pounds 25m by 1996-97.
Mr John Devaney, Eastern's chief executive, said this latest round of cost
cutting would be the company's 'last major announcement for a little while'.
Since privatisation, Eastern has shed about 30 per cent of its electricity
workforce, which will total about 4,800 after the latest cuts. These will be
spread over two years and are expected to occur through early retirement and
voluntary redundancy.
The cuts will be accompanied by a 30 per cent jump in capital spending over
five years. Instead of maintaining the existing network, Eastern intends to
invest Pounds 500m between 1995 and 2000 in technologically advanced
equipment. 'We will have a company which is more capital intensive,' said Mr
Devaney, 'but it will cost less to run.'
Some 650 jobs will be transferred from the day to day operations of the core
electricity business to implement the increased capital spending programme.
Eastern is also reorganising the engineering operation of its electricity
division, which will be operated through business units instead of
regionally.
All the associated costs have been provided for in last year's Pounds 38m
charge.
The market welcomed Eastern's announcement with some reservations. The cost
cutting would improve profits but higher capital spending would soak up any
cash flow gains. Furthermore, many had expected Eastern to announce further
share buy-backs before its closed period begins on Wednesday. 'The market
was looking for more excitement,' said one analyst. 'Yesterday's
announcement was not a huge surprise to anyone.'
The shares closed 1p down at 760p.

FT  11 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Housing recovery underpins Tay Homes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Tay Homes yesterday rose 12p to 163p as the Leeds-based
housebuilder announced pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 3.09m
to Pounds 6.23m for the year to June 30.
The recovery in the new housing market underpinned the rise, which was also
helped by the return to profit of the group's Scottish region.
Turnover advanced 22 per cent to Pounds 85.1m (Pounds 69.6m). The group sold
1,308 houses, an increase of 18 per cent on last year's 1,107, at an average
price of Pounds 64,700, compared with Pounds 61,000.
However, the land bank declined from 4,200 to 4,000 plots.
Mr Trevor Spencer, chairman, blamed the rise in land prices, which have
reached levels not seen since the boom of the late 1980s.
'We have been forced to become more selective in our land purchases,' Mr
Spencer said.
Land prices rose by an average Pounds 1,800 to Pounds 11,300 a plot during
the year, the rise eating into the group's cash pile despite the boost from
last year's Pounds 10.2m rights issue. As a result, gearing rose from 36 to
45 per cent.
Cost pressures had been felt from building materials suppliers but had been
largely contained at about the 4 per cent level.
Earnings per share increased from 9.1p to 15.5p and a proposed final
dividend of 5.1p lifts the total to 6.45p (5.85p).
Mr Spencer said that the group was now well positioned to take advantage of
the recovery in the market. However, although sales reservations were 25 per
cent ahead of the position seen this time last year, they had dropped off
since the latest rise in interest rates.
'Things have definitely slowed down, but we are hopeful that the level of
customer interest that has been shown will still convert into steady sales,'
he said.

Jones Group, the Dublin-based shipping, manufacturing and oil distribution

FT  11 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Argent to redevelop landmark office site
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argent Group yesterday announced plans to redevelop a 120,000 sq ft office
site in the City of London in a Pounds 17.4m deal.
Midland Bank, which owns the freehold to the site and rents the building -
Suffolk House in EC4 - at Pounds 1.25m a year from Argent, is to pay the sum
to free itself from the 40-year lease.
Argent said the price represented a 35 per cent increase on the amount it
paid for the lease 18 months ago.
Argent has also acquired, for a nominal Pounds 1, an option to buy the
freehold on the site from Midland, which no longer occupies the building. Mr
Michael Freeman, Argent's joint chief executive, said the company would
'almost definitely' be proceeding with the purchase and development if
planning permission were granted within the next few weeks.
'There is only one other building of Grade A office space over 100,000 sq ft
left in the City. The race is on to provide this kind of accommodation. I
doubt if any building of this grade will come in at a rent of below Pounds
40 per sq ft in 1997.' Mr Freeman said that even at only Pounds 37.50 per sq
ft and a 6.5 per cent yield, the development would be worth more than Pounds
70m.
Argent is to repay loans of Pounds 10.4m secured on the Suffolk House lease.
The net cash addition from yesterday's deal will come to Pounds 7m.
Analysts agree that rent rises have started to stick for high-quality
central London office space, but disagree over how quickly sustained growth
will come through.
Recent evidence from the Investment Property Databank suggests that an
excess of available space continues to hang over the property market and is
likely to limit rental rises if not depress them, at least in the
short-term. On the other hand, surveyors Richard Ellis and Jones Lang
Wootton are forecasting rental growth coming through more strongly next
year.

FT  11 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Manganese Bronze hails rise in black cab
sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manganese Bronze Holdings, the black taxi cab manufacturer, yesterday
reported a 36 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds
2.04m for the year to July 31.
Turnover remained flat at Pounds 74.6m (Pounds 75.4m) after an improved
performance by the group's vehicles division was offset by a slide at the
components side, which supplies bearings and precision castings.
The company announced it was increasing taxi production to 44 per week,
compared with a record low of 32 per week in June last year.
Orders for the black cabs, which retail at about Pounds 20,000, are expected
to reach 1,900 by the end of the year, compared with 1,600 last year.
'Business is picking up for taxi drivers, although I am not sure that many
of them would admit to that,' said Mr Jamie Borwick, chief executive. 'Quite
a few are bringing back orders they had deferred during the recession.'
The vehicles division trebled pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.23m on turnover of
Pounds 43.4m.
But the components division suffered a 70 per cent drop in pre-tax profits
to Pounds 551,000 after a 'disappointing' loss at the Redditch-based
precision castings business.
Last month the company disposed of LTI Homer, its lossmaking fuel tanks
offshoot, with an associated loss of Pounds 1.44m. However, it retains the
Fairway Nissan car dealership which continued to incur losses.
The Deans Powered Doors division, which supplies rail and bus manufacturers,
incurred a Pounds 315,000 loss (Pounds 2,000 profit). The company cut its
rail door manufacture, involving exceptional costs of Pounds 300,000.
Net interest charges fell from Pounds 320,000 to Pounds 52,000, and gearing
was reduced from 20 to 5 per cent.
A recommended final dividend of 2.5p makes a total of 4p (2.5p) for the
year, payable from earnings per share ahead to 7.58p (5.89p).
The shares dropped 2p to 147p.

FT  11 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Norweb leads recs with move to listing in
US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norweb today becomes the first UK regional electricity company to have its
shares listed in the US.
The Manchester-based utility has obtained a listing for American Depositary
Receipts on Nasdaq, the over-the-counter market.
The company said it had the largest proportion of shares in US hands of any
rec - about 5 per cent - and the move would provide greater liquidity for
American shareholders. The initial marketmakers will be Smith New Court and
Lehman Brothers.
The listing also reflects Norweb's strategy of raising its profile in the
US, where earlier this year it took a 50 per cent stake in a gas-fired power
project in Virginia. The company has an active policy of overseas expansion,
particularly in countries with a well developed regulatory framework and a
stable and mature political, economic and legal environment.
Norweb is also among those recs which have defined a specific dividend
policy. It aims to deliver annual real increases of 6 to 8 per cent up to
2000.
Analysts thought it unlikely that there would be a rush of other recs
seeking a US listing. The cash-rich electricity distributors have no need to
tap foreign capital mar-kets. Indeed, many of them - including Norweb - are
in the process of buying back up to 10 per cent of their shares. Few have
business interests or large numbers of shareholders in the US market.
However, Norweb's move could pave the way for a listing by the National Grid
company, which is owned by the recs and likely to be sold off next year.

FT  11 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Development Securities acquires two City
sites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Development Securities is to undertake its first development in the City
since it grew out of Clayform Properties under the hand of Mr Martin Landau,
the property entrepreneur.
It has exchanged a conditional contract for the purchase of Milton House and
Shire House in Silk Street, EC2, which currently comprise 450,000 sq ft of
offices. The deal is forward-funded by Haus Invest, the open-ended
Commerzbank property fund, and the properties are to be acquired for more
than Pounds 40m.
The vendor is a consortium of five Japanese banks, led by the Long Term
Credit Bank of Japan, which is the receiver to EIE, the Japanese developer
which went bankrupt. EIE paid about Pounds 200m for the properties.
Mr Erik Raune, senior development surveyor at DS, said all of Shire House
and a 'substantial' part of Milton House had been pre-let to Linklater &amp;
Paines, the international law firm, for its new City head office. After
refurbishment and with the benefit of pre-letting, the properties are
expected to be worth about Pounds 170m, DS claims.

FT  11 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Stanhope fails to dispel gloom - Group's
shares continue to fall as prospect of viable rescue wanes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stanhope's share price fell 26 per cent yesterday, after the heavily
indebted property developer revealed that potential rescuers were unlikely
to match last Friday's depressed share price.
The share price has almost halved in the past two weeks, and closed 5p lower
yesterday at 14p.
The price has been hit by share sales from a former director, but also by
growing evidence that refinancing discussions have not progressed, and that
Stanhope's time is running out.
The group has Pounds 130m of bank debt, and insufficient revenues to fund
it.
It needs to sell assets - primarily its 50 per cent stake in Broadgate
Properties, the City of London property company - or secure refinancing,
before a hands-off agreement with its banks expires on December 19.
Mr Stuart Lipton, chief executive and owner of 29 per cent of Stanhope, said
yesterday that whatever happened, the company would be forced to sell
assets.
The company has had a number of approaches, and Mr Lipton said there
remained three bidders, but he said negotiations were at both a 'preliminary
and conditional stage'.
It is understood that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which both run
substantial property funds, are now waiting on the sidelines after
expressing initial interest.
Stanhope's banks, led by Barclays, are currently reviewing a new set of
financing proposals presented by the company, but have given no response.
Mr Lipton said it was too early to say 'whether a recapitalisation would be
more or less beneficial for shareholders than the terms that might be
available from a possible offer'.
The company's difficulties will play into the hands of British Land, which
has secured a ringside seat at the auction by buying 30 per cent of
Stanhope's shares.
British Land would not comment on the state of negotiations, but said: 'If
there is someone who is interested out there, they would be wise to come and
talk to us, both because of our known interest in Broadgate and our major
shareholding in Stanhope.'
The initial share purchase by British Land resulted in the collapse of
negotiations that had been taking place earlier this year with a south-east
Asian investor which wanted to take a majority stake in the company.
One property banker said: 'Stanhope has been sitting there waiting for a
fairy godmother to come out of the wings and rescue it. It is finally
sinking in that this is very unlikely to materialise.'
Analysts suggest that Broadgate would fetch less than Pounds 1bn, almost
certainly leaving Stanhope with a negative net value.
The alternative of bank refinancing would result in high costs, and the
falling share price would make it difficult to pursue a debt-for-equity
swap.

FT  11 OCT 94 / JP Morgan allows peek into 'black box'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JP Morgan, the US investment bank, is to open up a central component of its
'black box', an internal system for measuring financial risks.
It will make the system it uses to measure daily movements in interest rates
 -including money markets, swaps, and government bonds - exchange rates and
equity indices available free of charge, even though this has taken years of
work and many millions of dollars to build up.
JP Morgan said it aimed to improve risk management and foster greater
stability in markets for derivative instruments such as swaps, futures and
options.
The move follows reports by industry bodies, such as the Group of 30 and the
Bank for International Settlements, which have stressed the benefits of a
single consistent measure for calculating market risk.
'This is a tool box rather than a black box,' said Sir Dennis Weatherstone,
chairman of JP Morgan, and head of the G30 study, which recommended the use
of a consistent measure to calculate market risk.
JP Morgan said its 'Risk - Metrics' system provides a consistent methodology
for measuring market risks and data needed for daily evaluation of risk.
The information will be provided through public access computer networks and
some other channels.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Scottish TV shares slide after profits fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The share price of Scottish Television dropped by 44p yesterday to 430p
after the company reported considerably worse than expected half-year
results.
The commercial television company, noted for programmes such as Taggart and
Doctor Finlay's Casebook, said pre-tax profits had fallen from Pounds 3.1m
to Pounds 1.7m in the six months to June 30.
Scottish TV put most of the blame on the chaos in television sales house
operations - the intermediaries between advertisers and television companies
 -after the spate of ITV takeovers and new government limits on sale house
ownership. An advertising boycott by Unilever, one of its large clients,
accounted for about one third of the setback.
As a result, Scottish TV's share of total advertising revenue dropped from
5.2 per cent to 4.9 per cent in the period.
Mr William Brown, Scottish TV chairman, yesterday issued what was in effect
a profit warning by predicting that profits for the whole year would fall to
about Pounds 9m from the 1993 figure of Pounds 13.1m.
The figures came a week after The Mirror Group, publisher of titles such as
the Daily Mirror and the Scottish Daily Record, bought a further 5 per cent
in Scottish TV to take its total stake to just under 20 per cent.
Last week's purchase and the original 15 per cent raid last month were both
at 520p.
Yesterday's drop in price means the Mirror, which has adopted a strategy of
expanding into electronic media, is showing a loss of more than Pounds 8m on
its Pounds 49m investment.
The Mirror argued yesterday that the share price had merely returned to the
level before its share purchase.
Scottish TV has now signed up with advertising sales house Television Sales
and Marketing Services and said it was looking forward to settled trading
conditions. 'We are hopeful that 1995 will see a return to growth and
progress,' Mr Brown said.
Six-month turnover fell from Pounds 64m in 1993 to Pounds 58.4m this time
and earnings per share dropped from 5.84p to 2.33p. The company is, however,
increasing its dividend by 5 per cent to 2.2641p. The figures included
Pounds 2.5m in exceptional restructuring costs, which it said would lead to
Pounds 1m savings next year.
Analysts, who had forecast full-year pre-tax profits of between Pounds 12m
and Pounds 16m, yesterday took Scottish TV at its word and cut expectations
to Pounds 9m.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Tiphook's finance director resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The exodus from Tiphook continued yesterday with the resignations of the
troubled transport leasing company's finance director and company secretary.
Half of the group's ten board members had resigned in March. Tiphook said
the latest departures reflected clashes of management style with the new
chairman, Mr Ian Clubb.
Mr Andrew Chandler, finance director, is likely to receive compensation of
about Pounds 100,000, as he had a one-year contract. This compares with
compensation payments of Pounds 2.68m in the year to April 1994, during
which the company reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 331.1m.
Mr Philip Price, company secretary, was not a director, and it is understood
that his compensation will be significantly less. Tiphook played down the
significance of the departures, which were described as amicable.
Mr Clubb, the former finance director of BOC Group, only recently took over
as chairman, following his appointment in June. He was seen as wanting to
stamp his authority on the finance systems of a company which has in the
past found it hard to predict revenue streams.
Mr Chandler had just returned from the US, where he and Mr Robert Montague,
Tiphook's chief executive, have been talking to the lawyers representing
plaintiffs in a Dollars 700m (Pounds 443m) class action suit against
Tiphook. The US investors claim they were misled when they bought Dollars
700m of bonds shortly before Tiphook's transformation from a high-flying
container leasing company into a substantial loss maker.
Tiphook said there were no developments to report from these meetings, and
that they were not connected to Mr Chandler's decision to leave. He is to
work until the end of November.
Mr Chandler was himself a sudden appointment, replacing his former boss Mr
Roger Braidwood, who left 'amicably' in August 1993 and received Pounds
560,000 in compensation.
Tiphook said recruitment of a new finance director was 'already under way',
and a new company secretary was due to join 'shortly'.
It is understood that Mr Montague will shortly be served with a bankruptcy
petition, over a Pounds 2.3m loan from Royal Bank of Scotland. Mr Montague
claims he is in no financial difficulty.

Yesterday the new chief executive of one of the UK's best, but not always
flatteringly, known international engineering groups displayed his new
regime.
Announcements of new divestments, restructuring provisions, stock value
revaluations and goodwill write-offs suggested a new broom sweeping clean.
Here was a new management team taking the nasty financial decisions which
would be more difficult after three years of responsibility.
There were the hints of the Simpson style, honed at Rover, where the
corporate culture shifted to the notion that customers need to like the cars
they buy.
'There's been a little bit of a tendency at Lucas to have technology for
technology's sake,' he said, adding that a 'refocusing of the businesses
will allow us to do things more quickly than we did before.'
Mr Simpson said: 'Lucas has been held back by too many businesses in the
portfolio which have been underperforming.'
But by getting rid of small businesses on the edge of Lucas's mainline
automotive, aerospace and electronic activities, Mr Simpson is doing nothing
new. He is following a restructuring policy which started with the
provision, during 1991-92, of Pounds 88.4m, which has all been used.
In another respect, his arrival suggests continuum rather than any break
with the past. He has the blessing of Sir Anthony Gill, his retiring
predecessor. Mr Simpson was, said Sir Anthony yesterday, 'worth waiting
for'. Indeed, given the size of Sir Anthony's shareholding in Lucas, Mr
Simpson is the guardian of his pension.
Mr Simpson's aim is to accelerate change, to use the technological base of
Lucas more forcefully. 'What has been missing has been consistent financial
success,' he noted. Underlying that is the fear that unless there can be
forged a closer alliance between technology and revenue, Lucas will be
picking up the crumbs of the major players in the automotive and aerospace
industries.
These players are reducing the number of their component suppliers. They are
forming long-term relationships, but at a price. They expect them to play a
design and supply role which demands both the ability to fund front-end
development and the manufacturing skills which continually drive down costs.
Lucas intends to play in that group; thus it needs to expand.
The main restructuring effort at Lucas is directed at the aerospace
activities precisely because they need, in Mr Simpson's view, to be welded
into a base on which there can be expansion to give Lucas more weight in the
industry.
Emphasis on the automotive side is different. There the problem is
organising enough capacity to meet demands for diesel fuel systems which
already exist. Technology has run ahead of manufacturing capacity.
Additional financial power - and Mr Simpson thinks it will take two years
for the full effects of the restructuring to come through - would take Lucas
out of the league of takeover targets and into the ranks of the predators.
Lucas has been the subject of persistent bid speculation by larger and more
powerful companies.
As it is, the costs of staying a supplier, not of parts but of systems, are
such that Lucas will seek collaboration with other groups on particular
projects. Mergers have been ruled out, if only on the grounds that such an
idea would create substantial regulatory difficulties.
Lucas and Bosch of Germany, for example, between them already have
overwhelming dominance in the market for diesel engine fuel injection
systems.
Mr Simpson's plans emerge from a review of Lucas since he took over last
April. It has already led to management changes which broke up portfolios of
businesses into product-dominated groups, each with a managing director.
He has chosen a good time to make changes, 'to create a new impetus', as he
put it. The fortunes of Lucas, regardless of internal changes, are turning.
The market for automotive products has been improving to the extent that
Lucas was able to push up margins by two percentage points last year. The
aerospace market's return to health is unlikely for 1 1/2 -2 years, but
Lucas thinks that it has at least bottomed out.
Margins in the automotive sector were 5 per cent while margins in the
aerospace business were 2 1/2 per cent. It is an indication of the distance
Mr Simpson wants to travel when he said that 'double digit margins would be
fantastic.'

Sappi, the South African paper company, is paying Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds
1.01bn) for SD Warren, a subsidiary of Scott Paper of the US, in the biggest
international acquisition yet undertaken by a South African company. The
deal is the second big acquisition by a South African company since the
country's April elections and follows mining house Gencor's Dollars 1.3bn
purchase of Billiton from Shell in July.
Sappi is buying Warren, which Scott put up for sale in May, in partnership
with US merchant bank Donaldson, Lufkind &amp; Jenrette and UBS Capital, a US
subsidiary of Union Bank of Switzerland. Sappi will have 70 per cent of
Warren's equity.
The acquisition lifts Sappi into the front rank of world paper makers.
Warren claims 27 per cent of the US market in coated woodfree papers, used
for glossy publications such as magazines and catalogues. Sappi will become
the world's largest producer of coated woodfree paper, with a claimed 15 per
cent global share.
Scott's sale of Warren, which accounts for 25 per cent of its turnover, is
part of a sweeping reorganisation announced in the summer by Mr Al Dunlap,
the company's new chairman. Scott aims to concentrate on its paper tissue
business, in which it is the world leader.
Sappi is South Africa's largest paper company, with 50 per cent of the local
market, and already has widespread international interests, including five
paper mills in the UK, and Hannover Papier in Germany, which was purchased
in 1990.
As a means of avoiding South African exchange control regulations, the deal
will be financed entirely off-shore, with Sappi raising debt outside South
Africa and securing it on its European assets. Sappi will put up Dollars
250m, of equity, DLJ Dollars 125m and UBS Dollars 25m. The rest of the
purchase price will come through a mixture of debt and junk bonds.
Mr Basil Anderson, Scott's chief financial officer, said part of the
proceeds would be used to pay down Scott's Dollars 2.3bn of debt. Scott
would also buy back 'a fair amount' of its own shares, he said, adding that
the company planned further unspecified asset sales. He said the Warren
disposal would reduce Scott's previously announced capital investment of
Dollars 900m over the next two years by about Dollars 200m.
Last year, Warren made pre-tax profits of about Dollars 80m on sales of
Dollars 1.2bn. In its peak year of 1989 it made Dollars 253m. The final
bidding for Warren is understood to have come down to a handful of
international paper companies, among them the Anglo-French paper maker Arjo
Wiggins Appleton with a partner. This was an apparent reversal of policy for
Arjo, which had previously denied it was interested in the whole of Warren.
Sappi said it had been helped in the bidding by the fact that US anti-trust
laws had ruled out a number of big US paper makers. It is understood that
several , including International Paper and Union Camp, dropped out at an
early stage.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Insolvency case work should go to private sector, report
advises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The private sector is likely to take over much of the administrative work
required to process insolvencies as a result of a report published
yesterday.
The work is currently carried out by the Insolvency Service, a Department of
Trade and Industry agency responsible for dealing with financial failure and
tackling fraud in insolvencies.
The report to the government by accountants Stoy Hayward advocates that
administrative 'case work' be done by private sector insolvency
practitioners, leaving the Official Receivers more time for investigations.
Stoy Hayward was asked last year to study options for the privatisation of
insolvency work.
Its recommendations would open up Pounds 31m-worth of work a year to
competition between private sector licensed insolvency practitioners, many
of them members of the big six accountancy firms.
The DTI said Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, had told
officials to start preparing for implementation of the preferred option, but
no final decision had yet been taken.
While the DTI's announcement emphasised the benefits of the option for the
prevention of fraud, Stoy Hayward's detailed report did find problems with
the plan. It would result in the private sector - which would become
involved after an insolvency order was made - having a role in setting
standards and spotting fraud before handing over work to an Official
Receiver.
'If this interface does not work well the investigations of the Official
Receiver would be impaired,' says the report.
The consultants sent details of the scheme to 78 potential contractors and
42 expressed interest in undertaking work for the Official Receivers. Fees
quoted by insolvency practitioners 'may have the potential to provide
improved value for money', according to the report.
Mr Keith Ellis, a spokesman for the trade unions at the Insolvency Service,
said the option, if carried through, would cost 1,000 jobs and undermine
efforts to combat fraud.
He said case work formed a vital part in the early stages of insolvency
work.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Major attacks Labour on Scotland and Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major last night put defence of the constitution and preservation of
Britain's independence in Europe at the centre of his strategy to counter
the electoral threat from Mr Tony Blair's Labour party.
On the eve of the official opening of the Tory party conference, the prime
minister accused the opposition of 'pandering' to Scottish separatism and
adopting a 'craven' approach to the integrationist ambitions of Britain's
European partners.
His comments came as Mr Jeremy Hanley, the newly-appointed but already
beleaguered Tory party chairman, predicted that this week's Bournemouth
gathering would demonstrate the Conservatives' credentials as 'the party of
government'.
Facing evidence of deep unrest among the party's grass roots supporters over
the economy and the government's record on law and order, Mr Hanley told an
opening news conference: 'Our aim is to produce a permanently stronger
United Kingdom and tax cuts will follow.'
Mr Major's speech marked a further nod in the direction of the leading
figures on the Tory right who see Europe as the defining issue of the 'clear
blue water' which he has promised to keep between the Conservatives and
Labour.
But it will add to the concern of pro-European Tories and those on the
centre-left who fear Mr Blair's move into the political centre ground will
drive the government towards the right.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has warned against the Tories
abandoning their chosen political territory for more 'extreme' policies.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, echoed that sentiment yesterday when he
said the government would not abandon its commitments to the key public
services to pay for pre-election tax cuts. But speaking to the traditional
pre-conference dinner of party agents, Mr Major said Labour's plans for a
Scottish assembly were 'explosive'. By pandering to the Scottish
Nationalists, Labour risked a breach similar to that between Quebec and the
rest of Canada.
Turning to Europe, Mr Major said that Labour had promised to accept anything
proposed by Britain's partners. It meant they could abolish 'the pound
sterling' just because others wanted them to. He added: 'I have never heard
such a craven attitude from a serious political party.'
He insisted the Tories would stick by their principles in the face of the
Labour threat. They included: freedom of the individual, responsible
citizenship, an economy built on enterprise, and allowing people to keep
more of the money they earn.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Ministers' deficit deal paves way for EU budget rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union finance ministers agreed yesterday on recommendations for
member states to cut their budget deficits to comply with the Maastricht
treaty terms on economic and monetary union.
The ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, also appear to have averted an EU
crisis by pressing Italy to agree on ratification of a planned increase in
the Union budget next year.
Without this increase, Spain had said it would not ratify an EU enlargement
plan to bring in Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway in January.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, resisted any suggestion that
he would be unable to make tax cuts because of the European Commission
deficit recommendations, which apply to all member states except Ireland and
Luxembourg.
With an eye on this week's Conservative party conference, he said: 'We will
make real tax cuts when we have reached a satisfactory position in public
finances.'
France won a token victory in deferring formal adoption of so-called
'excessive deficits' recommendations, after Mr Phillipe Seguin, the
anti-Maastricht Gaullist president of the National Assembly, demanded that
the European Parliament should be consulted first.
The recommendations urge member states to stick to the European monetary
union convergence plans they originally presented to their colleagues.
Italy, one of the most indebted member states, was urged to return to its
original target of stabilising its government's ratio of debt to gross
domestic product in 1995, instead of the new target of 1996 adopted by the
Berlusconi administration, in the light of economic recovery.
On the separate issue, Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said he
expected the Italian opposition to the EU budget increase to be resolved
within weeks.
A senior EU official said the likely compromise would probably lower Italy's
EU fine for cheating on its milk quota of over Ecu3bn (Pounds 2.36bn) which
the Commission has sought to halve.
The UK is challenging this reduction in the European Court but, as part of
the deal, would drop its case.

Saddam Hussein may be backing down from a Gulf confrontation, but that is
not necessarily bearish for crude prices. Since the US has gone to the
expense of mobilisation, it is unlikely to reward Saddam by swiftly lifting
the embargo on Iraqi oil exports. There should also be less pressure on the
administration to soften its line from Russia, China and France. If the
embargo is not lifted next year, it could last beyond 1996. President Bill
Clinton will not wish to give the appearance of caving in to Saddam in an
election year.
As important as what happens in Iraq is the picture of world demand and
supply. This year demand outside the former Soviet Union, where economic
activity has collapsed, looks set to grow by nearly 3 per cent. Much of the
growth has come from the US. That growth in US demand could slow down as its
economy responds to higher interest rates, but this is likely to be more
than offset by growth in continental Europe and Japan.
Meanwhile, supply remains tight. Opec shows every sign of maintaining
production discipline. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iran have all indicated that
this year's quotas should be rolled over when the cartel next meets in
November. A combination of growing demand and tight supply would have
predictable effects. Any dip in crude prices if the Iraqi crisis is indeed
resolved is likely to be temporary.

The record monthly increase in consumer credit in August appears to give the
lie to the idea that consumers are feeling glum. But the latest figures sit
oddly with signs of weakness from confidence surveys, as well as sluggish
retail sales and the stagnating housing market. So one should perhaps take
the consumer credit data with a pinch of salt. Not only do the data
fluctuate widely from one month to the next' increased borrowing could be
due to cheap credit offered by retailers to help move their stocks. The
interim results from the clearing banks would certainly support this view.
The essential point is that consumers still seem price conscious. If they
are borrowing, it is certainly not yet to finance a spending spree in which
cost is no object. While that holds true, there is less to worry about from
the large increase in producer input prices. No doubt last month's base rate
increase was a warning shot across the bows of companies thinking of trying
to pass on higher costs of raw materials, but it remains quite difficult for
them to do so anyway.
The art for the authorities will be to tighten policy just enough to keep up
that pressure without stifling demand altogether. The slight underlying
acceleration in the rate at which producer output prices are now rising
suggests the base rate move was timely. Gilts should take comfort from the
fact that, though Mr Clarke needed some persuading to make his pre-emptive
strike, at least he acted in the end.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sappi's Dollars 1.6bn acquisition of Scott's coated paper subsidiary, SD
Warren, is the largest US transaction struck by a South African company.
Such deals will proliferate as compatriot companies take advantage of their
country's international rehabilitation to reduce dependence on the domestic
market.
Given the recent inexperience of South African groups, Sappi's strategy, the
price it paid and its ability to reduce debt require special scrutiny. The
strategy looks valid; Sappi will now be world leader in coated paper, the
industry's fastest growing segment. The price, at 15 times historic
earnings, is no steal, but at a small discount to net asset value looks
reasonable. As for debt, Sappi could be accused of recklessness in taking on
such large sums so late in the US cycle. However, cash flow prospects are
promising. The coated sector, plagued by overcapacity, has lagged other
paper grades, but US prices bottomed in July, and since then two increases
have been announced and achieved. Little additional capacity is under
construction to undermine further rises. With the prospect of volume growth,
escalating prices, and the promise of further cost savings, Sappi should
quickly reduce its debt burden.
While Sappi may celebrate, for Arjo Wiggins Appleton the South Africans'
success is a setback. The Franco-British group had made no secret of its
desire to acquire elements of SD Warren. Yet again, financial constraints or
lack of nerve has held back the group's industrial progress. Restraint can
be a strength, but timidity is a serious management weakness.

FT  11 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Lucas limbers up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Provisions on the scale of those announced yesterday by Lucas Industries do
not normally trigger a euphoric stock-market reaction, especially when the
company concerned last pushed through a chunky restructuring provision only
two years ago. But, after his achievements at Rover investors have faith in
Mr George Simpson, believing that his strategy, and the sheer scale of the
provisions, imply a genuine break with Lucas's accident-prone past.
If the provisions were bigger than expected, so was the increase in
underlying profits and sales. Encouraging, for example, was the 13 per cent
increase in automotive turnover, achieved despite the modest pace of
recovery in the European car industry. Operating profits for this business
segment nearly doubled. Even so, margins here are a meagre 5 per cent. Lucas
aims to raise them to at least 9 per cent, which it earned at the top of the
previous cycle, but this will be no easy task.
Cost-cutting will help, but the path to robust margins - across the Lucas
group as a whole - requires the patient development of new products and
strategic alliances. In this respect Lucas looks a long way behind
competitors such as Bosch, Valeo or GKN in the race to become one of the
select band of favoured suppliers to the automobile industry.
If any manager can induce Lucas to catch up, it is Mr Simpson. But the
shares are taking a great deal for granted. They stand on a multiple of 18.5
times 1994-95 earnings, based on consensus forecasts, and yield little more
than the market average. This looks demanding, especially as the prospects
for a bid will be diminished by Lucas's determination to put its own house
in order.

Bully for St Edmund's College; it can take a joke. Observer recently
mentioned that England's oldest Roman Catholic school wants planning
permission for a petrol station/roadside cafe, and suggested it might
exchange its motto - Avita pro fide (for the ancient faith) - for a more
contemporary version, like 'Fill 'er up'.
Donald McEwan, St Edmund's headmaster, argues: 'Surely it should be in
Latin, and not the fractured English you suggest.'
He offers three options. Tu das escam in tempore opportuno - 'you fill them
up at the necessary moment' - is a little verbose. Mens sana in vehiculo
sano - 'a healthy mind in a healthy vehicle' - is a touch obvious. But
Conviva felix - 'happy eater' - has the snappy ring of commercialism.

So the greatest living novelist isn't going after all? The reason why Lord
Archer is not at the Conservative party conference, says Jeremy Hanley,
party chairman, is that the millionaire author is far too busy in the House
of Lords, where Labour's front bench yesterday demanded publication of the
Department of Trade and Industry's report into Anglia TV share dealing,
which gave Lord Archer star billing.
But no, he wasn't there either. The plot curdles.

Sexual politics are taking on a new meaning in the run-up to Germany's
elections. According to the German version of Playboy magazine, there is a
strong correlation between voting and mating habits. Polling some 1,300
people, the mag discovered that more than 50 per cent of Christian Democrat
voters record having sex once a month or less. Germany's most sexually
active voters are to be found in the reformed communist Party of Democratic
Socialism; 20 per cent reckon they have sex at least once a day. Is that why
they have no chance of forming the next government?

A new star is about to take her bow in London's diplomatic round. Noemi
Sanin, Colombia's new ambassador, is a conservative politician from Medelln
who enlivened many a dreary Latin American summit in her last job as
Colombia's foreign minister.
The London posting, which she will take up after completing a course in
English, is seen by some as just a stepping stone to her ultimate goal of
becoming Colombia's president. So as well as being out to refurbish her
country's image as a land of drug traffickers, she will be keen to have lots
of interesting photo-opportunities beamed back to Bogota as evidence of her
statesmanship.
No doubt Tristan Garel-Jones, the former foreign office minister and ardent
admirer of Ms Sanin and her country, can be counted on to make the right
introductions.

Don't panic. It's not another scandal sloshing across the bows of tugboat

Once they buzzed like bees round a honeypot; now they're all too busy. To

John Major will share a cup of coffee with her, before she waltzes on to the

Her media and business friends have more spare time. Sunday Telegraph editor
Charles Moore, Sir James Goldsmith and ITN's Dame Susan Tinson are on the

England (with envious greens); sour grapes and hard cheese to follow.
Will Sir Basil Feldman, Tory grandee and conference organiser, be welcome?
Surely not. Greeting the press, he recalled that Bournemouth 'has many happy

to ditch Lady Thatcher, who was gone within weeks.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Leading Article: University reform
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Quality is in danger of being crowded out by quantity in the debate over the
future of the UK's universities. With student numbers double the level of a
decade ago, ministers and universities should focus more on managing
expansion and less on measuring it.
Contrary to recent fears, demand for higher education is still increasing.
The number of university students enrolled for the current academic year is
not significantly down on last year - despite a fall of 4 per cent in the
number of 18-year-olds, who make up the bulk of university entrants.
However, controversy about precise numbers has distracted attention from
worrying evidence that the university system is under strain. Five years ago
there were 10.6 students for every lecturer. Now there are 14. Despite this,
the proportion of students gaining first-class honours degrees has risen by
50 per cent over the last decade, even when former polytechnics are
excluded. The Higher Education Quality Council, the universities' own
self-regulatory body, has found 'little consistency and much variation'
between universities, and even between faculties of the same universities,
in the methods used for classifying degrees. This points to a worrying
dilution of standards.
With government encouragement, universities have generated a number of plans
to improve quality assurance. They are developing new credit accumulation
systems, by which courses are assessed in separate units, and have proposed
a more powerful system for monitoring standards.
Such developments are welcome, but they are only a start. To safeguard
quality, universities need to attract first-rate staff - many able graduates
are deterred from entering academe by low salaries - and to foster
diversity. Universities that specialise are more likely to achieve
excellence.
The most effective policy to safeguard diversity is to ensure that former
polytechnics focus primarily on teaching and training, roles they were
performing well before acquiring their new status. Other universities should
develop more specialised research interests.
Ironically, the greatest obstacle to this at present is the government's
funding system. It was intended to produce a handful of research-based
universities. In practice, by tying funds to each university's quality of
research, it has encouraged precisely the opposite trend. Universities,
fearing a loss of funds, have stepped up their research work, which has
resulted in a wasteful duplication of effort across the system.
Rather than continue to encourage an unwarranted universalism, ministers
should limit the number of universities allowed to compete for research
funding. Competition for funding should continue, but only among a
designated 20 or so universities. The list should not be cast in stone. But
only by allowing such a group to excel will the twin principles of expansion
and excellence be maintained.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Dread of routine misery: Mark Nicholson and Edward Mortimer
explain the internal pressures driving the president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever the real threat to Kuwait posed by President Saddam Hussein's troop
build-up, there can be little doubt that he has mounted this defiant show of
force partly to deal with a domestic threat to his own regime.
The timing of the build-up is clearly related to discussion in the UN
Security Council on easing the sanctions imposed four years ago, especially
the ban on oil sales. It seems likely that Mr Saddam hopes, by staging a
crisis and generating criticism of US 'belligerence' at home and abroad, to
persuade the US to strike a deal, lifting sanctions in exchange for Iraqi
recognition of Kuwait within its UN-designated borders.
However, Mr Saddam's domestic audience is as important to him as the
international one. Many observers believe the past year has seen a
significant shift among ordinary Iraqis and in the army towards blaming Mr
Saddam for the grave suffering sanctions have wrought.
Mr Saddam himself took formal control of the government in May. Since then,
official food rations, on which the majority of the population depends, have
been halved, and barbarous penalties of amputation and branding (most of
them without any base in Islamic law) have been introduced for hoarders and
black marketeers.
Mr Saddam and his cabal of 20 or so executive leaders, almost all from his
own Tikriti clan, or related to it by marriage, have for the last four years
blamed Iraq's plight on a hostile conspiracy, hatched in Washington and
London and enforced by a 'hijacked' UN.
But according to Mr Anoush Ehteshami, senior lecturer in Middle East studies
at Durham University, the entire fabric of Iraqi society is 'unravelling'
because of the impoverishment of Iraq's middle classes, the increasing
inability of the state to provide basic nutrition and health, and the
climate of political fear and repression. Mr Saddam, he says, 'is seeing the
whole state crumble away at the edges'.
Mr Ehteshami points especially at an apparent erosion of support for Mr
Saddam in the regular army. The flow of desertions has accelerated in recent
months, with opposition sources claiming it to be as high as 40 per cent.
Except for elite units such as the Presidential and Republican Guards, Mr
Saddam's emptying coffers have not been able to maintain the army at the
privileged level of pay and perks to which it is accustomed.
'Much of the military is beginning to link up, through shared poverty, with
civil society,' says Mr Ehteshami. 'And among both there is increasingly the
view that nothing will change while Saddam is in power.'
Whether disgruntled army officers could rise up and overthrow Mr Saddam is
doubtful. Repeated rumours of coup attempts since the Gulf war have mostly
been followed by rumours of purges and disappearances among the senior
ranks, while Mr Saddam and his close-knit ruling clique have continued to
sit tight.
This spring, however, there appeared to be a serious rift in the clique,
when members of the hitherto powerful Duri clan were dismissed. Since then,
opposition sources have detected signs that even closer allies, such as the
defence minister, Ali Hassan Majid, are under suspicion. More and more,
power is vested in Mr Saddam's two sons, Udeh and Qaussy.
One explanation for this week's large military deployment is that Mr Saddam
felt the need to occupy the army in a distracting adventure. At the same
time, by forcing an international crisis and the arrival in the Gulf of tens
of thousands of US troops, the Iraqi leader may hope he can refocus
attention inside and outside the country on the alleged US and western-led
'conspiracy'.
'What Saddam dreads most is this feeling among Iraqis of routine misery and
that life under him has become tedious and unpleasant,' says Mr Charles
Tripp, a lecturer in Middle East politics at the School of Oriental and
African Studies in London.
An external crisis provides a note of drama, and enables Mr Saddam to strike
a 'heroic' pose.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Those who take pleasure in poking fun at the fickleness of management
fashion are having a field day. Two very different styles of management
theory are now parading down the catwalks.
One model, firmly in favour for the past few seasons, is for extreme
corporate concentration. The strategy is to pare the company back to a
streamlined core through repeated cuts in staff numbers and divestment of
superfluous divisions.
But the wave of mega-mergers which has been such a feature of US stock
market activity this year, creating some of the world's biggest empires in
media, healthcare and defence, makes a different argument: size is
essential. Can they both be right?
To an extent, yes, in that they both recommend specialisation. Some
divestments simply represent the acknowledgement that the ambitious
acquisitions of the last decade did not deliver the expected benefites.
Specialisation was certainly the mantra recited yesterday by Lucas
Industries, the UK-based conglomerate, in explaining the Pounds 214m of
exceptional charges for restructuring in its half-year results. Although it
pronounced the outlook 'quite bullish', it announced the sale of half a
dozen 'non-core' businesses to focus on aerospace and automotive products.
But the Lucas statement, which comes just weeks after Grand Metropolitan
revealed radical restructuring plans at its IDV drinks business, raises
other questions. Why are the changes necessary after so many years of
recession, and how far should the process be taken?
The restructurings partly reflect disappointment with the nature of the
economic recovery. Pressure on many companies' margins has been unexpectedly
great, a point made forcibly last month by BTR, the UK-based industrial
conglomerate, unveiling unexpectedly poor half-year results. Raw material
costs have risen, but growing international competition has - so far, at
least - prevented much of that increase being passed on through higher
prices in many sectors. Meanwhile, advances in telecommunications and
electronics have helped executives make repeated cuts in middle management.
But downsizing is not necessarily the best response to margin pressure.
Companies can weaken themselves if they become too lean. Cutbacks can lead
to problems in hiring and training new staff if growth in demand resumes,
and to sharp inflation in the salaries of the best staff. Excessive
slenderness may also inhibit investment, and sacrifice genuine opportunities
for synergy between different activities.
The retreat from constant corporate dieting may now be under way. Last week
General Motors hired several hundred production workers, the first it has
taken on since 1986. But in an environment of low inflation, management and
shareholders in some industries may have to accept that margins will be
lower than in the past.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Saddam back to centre stage: Iraq's leader is the focus of
world attention. But he may have made a serious misjudgement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For more than a decade President Saddam Hussein has developed and practised
his own personal formula for political survival. Its twin pillars are the
ruthless suppression of domestic opposition and the effective manipulation
of self-created external threats.
As the Iraqi leader has stumbled from one calamitous misjudgement to the
next, those two policy elements have become ever more critical to his
survival. And both have been, and still are being exercised without regard
to world opinion or changing international circumstances.
Mr Saddam's renewed military threat to Kuwait fits neatly into the pattern
that has evolved since Iraq embarked on its eight-year war with Iran in
1980. After modest initial successes, the war with Iran turned into a
disaster, costing hundreds of thousands of lives and almost bankrupting a
once relatively prosperous economy.
But the national struggle for survival against the radical Islamic threat
from Iran helped to deflect blame being attached to Mr Saddam. And far from
being subdued by the tough economic consequences created by the war with
Iran, Mr Saddam sought to recoup by invading Kuwait.
Again he massively misjudged, with yet more serious consequences for the
people of Iraq. But the western allies stood by as he snuffed out a
rebellion in the south and only belatedly prevented similar action being
taken against the Kurds in the north. Those twin threats to the national
authority of Baghdad helped rally support for Mr Saddam from his main
constituency in the central part of Iraq and part-icularly around his home
town of Takrit.
However the Iraqi leader has been unable to escape from the impact of UN
sanctions, imposed in 1990. Mr Saddam's immediate clique may still be living
well, but his grudging compliance with UN Security Council resolutions
dealing with the destruction and monitoring of weapons of mass destruction
underlines just how anxious he is to see sanctions lifted.
Recent statements from senior US officials, largely supported by Britain,
show equally just how far Mr Saddam has still to go before they will support
any such moves on sanctions.
The US administration believes that Iraq is still hiding Scud missiles and
facilities for producing biological weapons, and cites its unwillingness to
recognise Kuwait's UN-designated international border as further evidence of
the regime's undiminished regional ambitions. In short, sanctions on Iraq
will remain for the foreseeable future.
Mr Saddam is thus left with the one option he is most practised at
exercising: the threat of military force. But it is a threat that is in
every sense much less potent than it was four years ago.
Militarily Iraq has been greatly weakened, if not in manpower then certainly
in terms of equipment, spares and ammunition. The international alliance
created to launch Operation Desert Storm in January 1991 is still broadly in
place and militarily will benefit from pre-positioned equipment in Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait.
Mr Saddam might have had some excuse for failing to gauge international
reaction correctly in 1990. The Soviet Union had crumbled, but the
whole-hearted Russian support for the allied action in defence of Kuwait was
not entirely predictable. In 1990, the Arab-Israeli conflict did not look
susceptible to resolution, and there were other Middle Eastern regimes and
their populations attracted by the possibility of indirectly attacking US
and Israeli interests in the region.
Just how much this situation has changed can be seen from the stances of the
Palestine Liberation Organisation and of Jordan. Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO
chairman, gave initial support for the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and King
Hussein was the most vigorous proponent of a negotiated settlement with the
Iraqi regime. Today both men are locked into a peace process with Israel and
both are welcome guests in the White House. Neither will easily sacrifice
that, and initial reports suggest that they are under no domestic pressure
to do so.
Elsewhere in the Middle East, the realities of US diplomatic and military
dominance, coupled with the possibility of a durable peace with Israel, have
encouraged similar policy shifts.
Tunisia and Morocco, where support for Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was evident
among sections of the public, are on the road to establishing full
diplomatic relations with Israel. The six members of the Gulf Co-operation
Council (GCC) have begun to dismantle the Arab boycott. Yemen, which was
also sympathetic to Mr Saddam, has been further weakened by civil war, while
Sudan is an irritant limited to marginal involvement in Islamic extremism.
Meanwhile the stance of those Arab countries which supported the western-led
alliance in 1990 appears to be largely unchanged, and perhaps even more
solidly supportive. Syria, under president Hafez al-Assad, says that it has
made a strategic commitment to seek peace with Israel and has not softened
its long-standing hostility to the Iraqi regime. Egypt's consistency remains
unwavering, while the GCC states are predictably united in their
determination to do whatever is necessary to beat off any fresh threat from
Iraq.
There may even be benefits for the region's main oil producers from Mr
Saddam's latest threat of military action. The possibility of Iraq being
allowed to resume exports was one of the main causes of the weakness in the
oil price, especially earlier this year. With Saudi Arabia and Kuwait both
running substantial budget deficits and committed to ambitious spending
plans, a sustained weakness in the price of oil indicated difficult
political decisions in the years ahead.
The maintenance of UN sanctions against Iraq will not remove the need for
those structural adjustments, but a firmer oil price should help to ease
immediate budget pressures. This, in turn, will help to ensure that Saudi
Arabia in particular can finance its substantial military and civil airliner
procurement programmes.
Against that must be set the costs of a new military build-up in the Gulf.
The US is likely to require a contribution from its regional allies whose
ability to pay has been sharply reduced by the 1990-91 conflict. Saudi
Arabia estimated that the Gulf war cost it some Dollars 60bn, or virtually
its entire available reserves, which it has had no opportunity to replenish.
Whether any of these considerations impinge on Mr Saddam's decision-making
process is virtually impossible to know. By moving troops close to the
border with Kuwait, the Iraqi leader has already cut the ground from under
the feet of governments which would have liked to soften the hardline US
policy towards the containment of the Iraqi regime.
France and Russia in particular had seen merit in offering the prospect of
easing sanctions as a result of Iraqi compliance with the monitoring of
weapons production.
Indications that Mr Saddam may be pulling back from the brink emerged last
night when Mr Hamed Youssef Hummadi, the Iraqi minister of information,
claimed that 'not one unit' had been moved and suggested that talk of a
build-up of troops was a 'total fabrication by the US'.
Mr Saddam has several times in the past purged incipient rebellions with his
officer corps, but even his iron political control of the army might be
tested by a decision to order troops into a certain repeat of the Desert
Storm experience.
The Iraqi leader's next move will depend largely on how fragile he believes
his domestic position to be. He may calculate that he has lost nothing by
provoking an international crisis, because sanctions were not going to be
lifted anyway.
At the same time, Mr Saddam is back at the centre of world attention where
he most wishes to be. That might be enough for the time being.
But President Clinton and his allies are wise to prepare for the possibility
of military action. Mr Saddam was a dangerous political animal when at least
some of the chips were stacked in his favour. He is unlikely to be less
dangerous now that he feels he has little more to lose.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Power shift in Austria
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sharp drop in support for Austria's long-lived coalition of
conservatives and socialists in Sunday's general election illustrates a
Europe-wide trend. Five years after the fall of the Berlin wall, the effects
of political and economic transition are making life difficult for incumbent
parties nearly everywhere, with consequent benefit for the electoral
fringes. The Social Democratic party and the conservative People's party
will remain in power, but both recorded their lowest election scores since
1945.
Elsewhere in Europe, government parties have suffered setbacks in elections
this year in Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark. At the German
elections on Sunday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl will probably hold on to power,
yet the conservative Bonn parties appear likely to register their lowest
share of a general election vote since 1949.
The main winner in Sunday's Austrian poll was the far-right Freedom party,
whose leader Mr Jorg Haider combines a xenophobic stance on social and
immigration policies with liberal economic views. He has edged closer to
power, conceivably in a coalition with the People's party at the next
election in 1998 or sooner.
However, it would be mistaken to see Sunday's result exclusively as a swing
to the far right. In terms of their proportionate increase in seats, the
left-leaning Greens and the centrist Liberal Forum did as well as the
Freedom party. Final parliamentary assent for Austria to join the European
Union in January is not in doubt.
Many voters have deserted the government parties, but they are far from
expressing blind faith in Mr Haider's doctrines. Rather, the electorate has
shown its frustration at the grand coalition's octopus-like grip on
Austria's political and economic life. If the coalition's buffeting results
in genuine moves to loosen Austria's inbred corporatism, the shift will be
greatly welcome.
The coalition's reduced majority will none the less add to policy-making
difficulties. Stern fiscal action will be necessary to keep the budget
deficit from rising beyond 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product next year,
when expenditure is due to rise because of additional payments to farmers
and to the EU budget.
In relations with the rest of Europe, the fraying of the coalition may make
Austria a less comfortable partner. Integrating Austria with the rest of
Europe was supported by two-thirds of voters in the June referendum, but it
could cause pain for protected sectors of the economy.
The impact of Mr Haider's rise should not be over-stated, but it indicates
the reservations of some Austrian voters about moving towards the more
federal Europe envisaged under the Maastricht treaty. Austria is one of the
countries closest to fulfilling the Maastricht criteria for economic and
monetary union. However, on the evidence of Sunday's poll, Austrian
scepticism about tightening integration further may, in future, become more
overt.

If the Conservatives establish 'clear blue water' between themselves and
Labour this week, they will drown in it. Few tears would roll down the
nation's cheeks. The anti-government majority would be well pleased.
Thinking Tories, who are more numerous than appearances suggest, might tell
themselves that a spell of opposition would be the most constructive way to
spend the last few years of the century.
'Clear blue water', a Tory cliche, has become a term of political discourse.
It implies a stance distinct from, and usually to the right of, the
opposition. Mr Michael Portillo, the chief of the liberal-nationalist
faction of his party, is one proponent of the transparent azure liquid
strategy. The assumption is that, if he were to be elected paramount chief
of the Conservatives, he would rule with a firm hand, and lead us towards
minimalist government, the reassertion of family values and the protection
of national sovereignty.
He would doubtless create a forcefield somewhere in the middle of the
English, or more accurately Franco-British, Channel. The latter would be
maintained at a strength sufficient to protect us from continental European
influences. Romantic xenophobes and market worshippers would delight in such
a party. The rest of us could enjoy the frisson of watching it flounder.
That might have been the consequence of last October's Conservative
conference in Blackpool, in which Mr John Major, then perceived to be in
danger of defenestration, leaned heavily to the right. The ministerial
speeches were nearly all in the same direction. As to this year, we must
wait. The prime minister is not about to be overthrown. Some of his
colleagues, such as Mr Kenneth Clarke, have kept their sights on what the
electorate expects. 'I am certainly not going to go back on our election
commitments to the great public services and start making cuts that go
beyond cutting out waste,' the chancellor said yesterday.
The Tory convention, which begins in Bournemouth this morning, is likely to
be preoccupied with the growing strength of the Labour opposition. What to
do? The choice must be agonising. Some urge a further rightwards turn,
towards what Mr Tony Blair has memorably designated 'planet Portillo';
others a return to the centre a la Clarke; yet others that ministers should
henceforth do very little and say nothing startling.
The latter is a sensible approach. It is compatible with Mr Clarke's
persistent theme, which is that only a prolonged period of 'good government'
will get the Conservatives out of the deep hole in which they find
themselves. If two more years of economic recovery and low inflation are
crowned with pre-election tax cuts, the voters may be gulled again.
That would be a pity. The Tories need to go into the wilderness and
contemplate their past and our future. Conservative Century*, a sympathetic
new history, tells us how the party has found itself in government twice as
often as its opponents. Mr Robert Waller, one of the score of contributors,
reminds us that since 1900 it has won 13 of 24 general elections outright,
and done very well in four others. Mr Anthony Seldon writes that 'either
standing alone or as the most powerful element in a coalition, the party
will have held power for 70 of the 100 years since 1895'. There is no
mystery about how this was achieved. 'The Conservative party's greatest
strength has flowed precisely from its determination to reflect public
opinion. Where it lost touch, ignored it, or was slow to adapt . . . it was
denied power.'
That is why its proper role is to lose next time. As a mirror of popular
expectations, the party is cracked from side to side. It would be unfair to
place all the blame for this on Mr Major and his colleagues. Most of us are
bewildered by the conundrums of post-communist capitalist society: how much
to be done by government, how much privately; how to reduce unemployment;
what measures are necessary for survival in the global economy. But Labour
showed in Blackpool that it is searching for popular answers. The Tories
have arrived in Bournemouth in factions.
Nowhere is this more the case than over Europe. Professor Keith Middlemas,
another contributor to Conservative Century, writes that the Single European
Act can be seen in part as a response by the Conservative government of the
day to pressures by leading corporations to open up previously closed
European markets. For financiers and industrialists, he argues,
'sovereignty, law and state power are no longer conceivable in strictly
national terms'. Not for the first time, he concludes, 'the party lags
behind'. Mr Major addressed Tory agents in Bournemouth last night. He
accused Labour of pandering to Scottish separists, and rolling over in
Europe. It was sharply phrased, and it promised no catch-up.
The proposition that a few years of opposition would provide productive
reconsideration time for the Tories is rejected by Mr Daniel Finkelstein,
director of the Social Market Foundation, a think-tank. Mr Finkelstein has
been in post-Reagan/Bush America. The Republicans, he writes in SMF Memo No
9**, are more divided, leaderless and lacking in coherent ideas than ever.
Some want to retrench the US welfare state; some are deregulators and
tax-cutters; others preach the US version of 'back to basics'; yet others
are protectionists and isolationists. A synthesis is 'more likely to emerge
in government as politicians struggle to implement a programme in diverse
departments and are bound by collective responsibility', writes Mr
Finkelstein.
In Britain, the opposite is true. The Conservatives are in government, and
yet in difficulties because they are divided, not strongly led, and wanting
in coherence. Worse, after 15 years of uninterrupted power, they appear to
be falling victim to Acton's dictum. British corruption is not traditionally
of the sort that puts money in pockets, but the alleged and proven
transgressions of this code are becoming too numerous to ignore. A prolonged
dip in the translucent briny might do more than untangle the Conservatives'
thinking. It might clean up their act.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Well equipped for investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From PETER ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Once again the leading UK industrial associations are pressing a case
for better fiscal incentives to stimulate investment ('Industry leaders
press Clarke for investment Budget', October 10). In doing so they point to
the lower investment levels in the UK relative to most other industrial
countries in the past 30 years.
This is a correct observation. Gross domestic fixed capital formation as a
proportion of gross domestic product in Britain averaged 18 per cent over
the period 1960-89, when compared with the OECD average of 22 per cent.
However, all of this shortfall was a result of lower levels of investment in
UK residential and non-residential construction. Investment in equipment and
machinery as a proportion of GDP averaged 8.5 per cent over this period,
compared with an OECD average of 8.7 per cent, and 8.8 per cent in France
and 8.6 per cent in Germany. Thus, there has been no dramatic shortfall in
the UK in the volume of equipment investment.
Yet it is higher equipment investment which is usually postulated as being
most likely to make a contribution to higher long-run productivity growth.
This is the variable favoured by the 'new growth economics' currently
popular with the Labour leadership, and by the industry associations. There
may indeed be a case for looking again at the tax system to see if there are
any biases against equipment investment. However, the level of equipment
investment is not obviously the area where Britain has trailed significantly
in recent decades.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Explanation of what will do the trick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARK CORNEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Two sound bites still echo from Labour's debate on the economy. First,
shadow chancellor Gordon Brown's commitment to 'use every possible measure'
to achieve full employment. And, second, GMB general union leader John
Edmonds's obvious point that the 'minimum wage is meaningless without full
employment'.
Clearly, Brown must tell the electorate whether he thinks investing in
skills and increasing the capacity of the economy are sufficient measures to
achieve full employment without pay inflation. If he does, then presumably
he thinks the UK's increasingly flexible labour market will curb pay
inflation (as the economy moves towards full employment), an inheritance
which he must credit the present government for.
However, if he does not think that a combination of investing in skills,
boosting industrial capacity and highly flexible labour markets will do the
trick, perhaps he might explain the 'measure' which will.

Sir, Your editorial, 'Free the Post Office' (October 7), asserts in nebulous
privatise-speak that 'consumers stand to gain from the greater efficiency

Were the benefits really so transparent, I doubt that your correspondent
would have felt obliged to report only a week before ('Post Office watchdog
raps sell-off plans', September 30) that 'users were also concerned. . .as
to the benefits likely to flow from privatisation'.
In reality, the benefits seem confined to satisfying party dogma.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW WARREN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The duties of the director-general of Ofgas are specified unequivocally
in the Gas Act 1986. The present director-general, Clare Spottiswoode, chose
to emphasise their limitations most emphatically when she decided to
repudiate the agreement made by her predecessor to provide funding for the
government's Energy Saving Trust, as being outwith her remit.
However, you quote Clare Spottiswoode ('MPs to speed up gas deregulation
probe', October 4) as saying that she has a 'duty' to warn the government
that indecision regarding possible new legislation for deregulating the gas
market might damage the interests of those considering entering this market.
That 'duty' is not easy to identify in the 1986 Gas Act.
One can only hope that her latest definition of her duties also allows Ms
Spottiswoode to reconsider the damage that Ofgas's volte face on funding the
Energy Saving Trust has done, to the interests of those operating within the
energy efficiency market.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Into the EU's arms: Finland's bid to join the European Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Finland looks set to vote to join the European Union on Sunday, in a
referendum that will not only mark an historic shift in its own regional
allegiance, but which could prove a turning point in the enlargement of the
Union.
A Yes vote would represent a decisive move by Finland away from cold war
neutrality and into the west European fold. After the deepest recession
since the 1930s, many Finns hope it would also bring substantial economic
benefits.
But more important, as the first of three referendums on EU membership in
the Nordic countries, the Finnish vote may influence the outcomes in
neighbouring Sweden and Norway.
Austria has already voted in a referendum in June to join the EU. But there
have been strong doubts over whether the people of the three Nordic
neighbours would agree with their leaders on the desirability of membership.
The sequence of Nordic referendums was therefore deliberately staged to
start with Finland, where opinion has tended to be the most pro-EU. The hope
is that a Finnish Yes will encourage Sweden to opt for membership, in its
November 13 vote, and even overcome the formidable anti-EU ranks massed in
Norway, where voting takes place on November 28.
If all four applicants accept membership, the EU will be expanded from 12 to
16 members on January 1, and the way will be clear for its next great
expansion - into eastern Europe. Already last week, the European Commission
was asked by EU foreign ministers to draw up a detailed report on how
Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania could be
integrated into the EU's single market ahead of their full membership.
But this scenario would be seriously disrupted if the Nordic countries were
to turn their backs on Brussels, and the Finnish campaign has not been a
smooth ride for the Yes camp.
The leading party in Finland's centre-right coalition government, the Centre
party of prime minister Esko Aho, has been deeply divided over EU
membership.
It is the party of Finland's farmers, and the farmers, through their union
the MTK, have bitterly opposed joining the EU, because of the reduction in
agricultural prices and subsidies that membership would bring. The MTK is
outraged that membership could see parts of Finland receiving less farm
support than more prosperous farmland elsewhere in the EU.
This has prompted open opposition to EU membership among influential Centre
party members such as Mr Paavo Vayrynen, who was foreign minister when
Finland began its membership negotiations with Brussels.
Mr Aho has, however, managed to retain official Centre party support for
membership, chiefly by pushing through a FM4bn farm support package to
cushion farmers against the shock of joining.
But EU supporters - led by the Centre party's main coalition partner the
Conservative party and the opposition Social Democrats - have become
increasingly confident of a Yes vote not because the farmers have been
mollified, but because they believe voters are being persuaded by the
broader economic and strategic gains of membership.
A detailed study of attitudes towards EU membership by the Centre for
Finnish Business and Policy Studies last month showed that while voters were
concerned about the negative impact of EU membership on social issues - with
44 per cent believing it would affect healthcare negatively, against just 3
per cent - most voters believed membership would benefit the economy.
This belief is made more potent by the depth of Finland's most recent
recession. Between 1991 and 1994, the economy shrank by 13 per cent - partly
due to the loss of privileged trade with the Soviet Union. Unemployment has
risen to almost 20 per cent of the workforce, ranking with Ireland and Spain
as among the highest in Europe.
Finland already complies with the bulk of EU economic and trade policies as
a member of the European Free Trade Association. But full membership of the
EU would mean taking on board the Union's agricultural policy as well, which
could harm Finland's farming sector. EU advocates argue, however, that
membership is vital to a broadly-based economic recovery.
Membership would help Finland attract both the internal and inward
investment needed to re-establish long-term growth and bring down
unemployment, they argue.
'In a small economy such as Finland's we have learnt that what you can
determine on your own is not much and is getting narrower all the time,'
says Mr Pekka Ahmavaara, leader of KEY, a joint trade union campaign for a
Yes vote. 'All the research shows membership is a better solution for
economic growth than staying outside.'
Finnish voters seem persuaded. Some 64 per cent of voters in the CFBPS study
believed EU membership would enhance export and foreign trade, with just 5
per cent believing the opposite, while 39 per cent expected EU membership to
improve foreign investment, compared with 11 per cent against.
They also seem convinced of the strategic benefits of membership, with 49
per cent indicating that 'as a neighbour of unstable Russia', the country
would be more secure within the EU, as against 27 per cent who believed the
opposite.
'We need to stabilise our international position,' says Mr Paavo Lipponen,
leader of the Social Democrats. 'That is the most important thing after the
changes in Europe. And the economic costs of staying outside the EU have
grown higher because of European integration.'
Mr Risto Volanen, working for the No side, says that as an EU member,
Finland would be forced to identify with western security and defence
policy, which could be provocative to Moscow. 'I am worried we are putting
ourselves on the chessboard in such a way that we are not in control of the
moves that are made,' he says.
But the government is adamant: 'The mere fact that we are members will give
security without us having to make any new military arrangements,' says Mr
Pertti Salolainen, minister for foreign trade. 'If you are a member of the
EU you are untouchable because the Union could never accept any aggression
against one of its members.'
The signs are that this view sums up the feeling of a majority of Finns.
They may not be filled with much Euro-enthusiasm, but a deep sense of
defensive pragmatism should be enough to make voters accept the biggest
change in Finland's international alignment since 1945.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: No evidence favouring car
supermarkets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor JONATHAN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your editorial on the European Commission's decision on the block
exemption for the car dealer system ('Brussels' foot on the brake', October
6), you appear to assume the present system is more expensive and offers
less choice and convenience to consumers than possible alternatives, notably
some form of car supermarket. The evidence does not support these
assumptions.
A typical UK car dealer retains less gross profit margin before his expenses
than the large grocers make as net profits: the total asset turns of the two
industries are broadly similar. As margins are driven down by the fierce
competition between dealers and manufacturers, selling new cars is close to
being intrinsically unprofitable; there is very little scope for reducing
prices on the back of lower costs.
Research in both conventional retailing and the dealer industry indicates
that increased outlets would not significantly reduce operating costs.
Grocery superstore profit benefits flow more from market power and logistics
(that do not apply to the car market) than outlet operating economics. Car
supermarkets would use their local market power to raise margins and prices
to the detriment of the consumer.
There is no reason to believe that car manufacturers could lower costs as a
result of increased retail concentration. European manufacturers already
face the problem of overcapacity of 4m vehicles, a far more worrying
problem.
Would consumers really want car supermarkets? There would be fewer of them,
presumably much further apart, so the average distance travelled to buy
would increase and the car would have to be serviced by a different company.
As for the benefits of several makes in one showroom, research shows that,
because the single-franchise outlets are more experienced with the product,
they are preferred by many consumers. Many decide what to buy long before
they reach a dealership, their decision being based on magazine reviews,
their own and friends' experience etc. Fewer dealers would mean less
intra-network competition, again giving the seller more opportunity to raise
prices.
Product choice would also be reduced. In a competitive market, car
supermarkets would have to adjust their selling effort to respond to the
relative success of different car models. As cars are physically large and
as there are more than 500 car models sold in the UK, the supermarkets would
make frequent choices of which selection of cars to support. This would
raise the volatility of demand at product-line level, raising risk in the
industry, forcing the manufacturers to ask for higher margins and putting
pressure on them to cut marginally profitable niche products.
Those who draw analogies between different industries - as BEUC, the
European consumers' organisation, and others seem to be doing - should
beware being over simplistic.

Sir, In the Lex column, powerful arguments were advanced in favour of the
rationalisation (by merger) of the US rail network ('US railroads', October
7). The comment was made that the 'fragmented rail network is an immense
burden on the US economy. It drives up costs. . .and prevents the sector
winning business from road haulage. Rationalisation would also allow rail
companies to cut duplicative headquarters, rail routes. . .'.
Forgive me for quoting so much. The reason is that the arguments apply with
equal, indeed greater force, to the forthcoming fragmentation of the British
Rail network. Would it not be sensible to call a halt before further costs
are incurred and the network is actually broken up.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Arts: Impressionist view of social realism - William Packer
finds the work of Gustave Caillebote full of surprises, despite his
bourgeois reputation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In his proper character as a painter, Gustave Caillebotte is perhaps the
least well-known of all the Impressionists. A few particular images  - the
huge 'Paris Street in the rain', of 1877, from Chicago's Art Institute, for
example, with its forced perspective and grey-suited figures under grey
umbrellas, stark against the wet, bright pave: or the Musee d'Orsay's
'Parquet layers', of 1875, the workmen kneeling and stretching to their
planes in strong silhouette against the reflective floor - have alone
sustained a curiosity as to whatever else he might have done.
But fate conspired against him, not in any single regard, but in perverse
combination. He died comparatively young - this year marks the centenary of
his death at the age of 45 after a career of barely 20 years. He was
well-off - so much so that he was able to put together a notable and pioneer
collection of the work of his Impressionist friends. He then left his
collection to the state.
Not all of it was accepted, but some 40 works were finally picked out, of
Cezanne, Manet, Degas, Sisley, Pissarro, Monet, Renoir . . . They include
such famous plums as Manet's 'Balcony', Monet's 'Gare St Lazare', Renoir's
'Bal du moulin de la Galette' and his most delicious nude, who sits in
dappled sunlight beneath the trees. Thus Impressionist painting came into
the French public collection for the very first time.
But all this left poor old Caillebotte's own reputation rather up in the
air. His dealer, Durand-Ruel, did give him a memorial show in the summer of
1894, and a couple of his best things - the 'Raboteurs de parquets' and a
view over roofs in the snow - were also given to the state by his heirs, but
all too soon the name of Caillebotte the painter gave way to that of the
dilettante, the amateur, the benefactor.
No doubt, had he lived, his weightier oeuvre would have redressed the
balance. Other painters have enjoyed private means but have then been less
sociable and urbane. Other painters have died young, but in circumstances
more fraught or tragic. Caillebotte, perhaps, was simply too normal a
bourgeois, too open in his interests and unextreme in taste and temperament,
to be taken that seriously.
He was admittedly an uneven artist, a function, perhaps, simply of
inconsistency of application. Clearly much of his work was done in
intermittent bursts of activity that settled on particular themes or visual
interests, albeit sustained over considerable intervals - the raboteurs, the
life of the streets, industrial development and urban renewal, rowing and
sailing, the garden in the country, the grands boulevards, the still-life.
But, uneven or not, episodic or not, the work is unmistakable in its
essential quality and interest. And it is full of surprises. Comparisons are
inevitable - with Renoir in the soft, tactile modelling of the figure; with
Degas in the radical liberties taken with the composition; with Monet and
Manet on the river and Pissarro in the fields and gardens - but always
Caillebotte remains his own man, with a view of the world that is entirely
his own.
A little younger and a later starter than his fellows, he retained rather
more thoroughly than they, perhaps, the academic influences of the Ecole des
Beaux Arts. His compositions were conscientiously worked out, squared up
from preliminary drawings, the figures studied in isolation, details noted.
And there is something, too, of the social realism of the Salon in the
contrast he draws between the bourgeois and the working life, and in his
interest in the modern, changing city, with its iron bridges and Haussmann's
wide new boulevards.
The ironies of workmen laying expensive parquet, or a bourgeois, au paysan,
working his kitchen garden, were surely not lost on him. Yet there is no
polemic to it, none of a Millet's romantic self-identification, or a
Pissarro's socialist agonisings. His cooler detachment is quite his own.
His vertiginous perspectives were new, and look how the tracery of the
balcony itself becomes the near-abstract subject of the picture. Look down
at the island refuge in the middle of the carrefour. Look down upon the tree
below, and the circular grating at its base, and the bench beside it, set
out like a map. There is a freshness of vision here, an unselfconscious
originality that should be recognised. Near and far are what fascinate him,
the figure set on the balcony against an infinite distance, the fists of the
oarsman thrust up to the picture-plane, the tiny figures glimpsed through
the ironwork.
But how well, at its best, it is done, how fresh in the paint, how crisp and
lush the chrysanthemums, how strong the oarsmen in the modelling, how light
the snow on the rooftop. Here surely is a true painter seen clearly at last,
and seen whole, in his own right. Was he the first to look down on the
boulevard far below, to make the balcony a subject in itself, to remark the
dignity of labour, to take a boat on the river? No: but it hardly matters.
In the end, as always, it is painting as painting that counts.

Since other book prizes involve larger sums of money, and since The Booker
Prize is so flawed by the determination to choose the politically correct
rather than the best, it is hard to see why BBC2 continues to play along by
providing the hype so deeply desired by the organisers. But they do. In
addition to live coverage of the event at 8.00 they also lay on an interview
with the winner in The Late Show at 11.15. BBC1's new series Natural
Neighbours sounds like another of those 'just fancy that' shows which are
replacing journalism on television. Today's opening edition rounds up lots
of stories about brave and intelligent pigs (8.30). Wasted Windfall is the
second in three programmes about North Sea oil. Do you really need to watch
once you have read the title? (9.00 C4). Talking of titles, there is surely
a hostage to fortune in Alan Bleasdale Presents. There would be weight in
'Alan Bleasdale Writes' or even 'Produces', but 'Presents' just sounds like
a way of working in his name. Tonight's drama is said to be a black comedy
(10.00 C4). Network First is about Britain's chemical weapons programme
(10.40 ITV).

FT  11 OCT 94 / Arts: Maria Stuarda - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is surprising that nobody north of the border has thought of bringing
together a mini festival of the best-known Scottish operas. Not operas by
Scottish composers of course, as there are not enough; but those early
19th-century Italian operas set in Scotland, which were so popular at a time
when anything wrapped in tartan was fashionable.
The leading contender has to be Donizetti's Maria Stuarda, however diluted
its Scottish blood may be. Schiller wrote the play, traducing historical
facts as he went, and there is no local colour in either the music or the
drama. At times, one could be dealing with the stock characters that people
most of Donizetti's historical operas, except that between them composer and
dramatist did create a genuinely noble and suffering personality for their
heroine, Mary Stuart.
It is a shame that Scottish Opera should have given her one of its least
convincing productions of recent seasons. Donizetti follows Schiller by
making a fictitious confrontation between Mary and Elizabeth I the high
point of his opera and Stefanos Lazaridis's production never lets us forget
it: a revolving platform centre-stage is divided with Mary's door on one
side and Elizabeth's on the other, each popping out as the occasion demands,
like figures in a weather clock.
When Elizabeth swings into view, we know stormy weather is on the way. The
soprano Michie Nakamaru lets fly at the role wildly and gives more than her
voice - not a large or lustrous instrument - might reasonably be expected to
deliver.
In contrast, the appearance of Mary forecasts placidity. Yvonne Kenny in the
title-role gets all the best music and treats it with due care, shaping
lines thoughtfully, shading the voice sensitively (except at the top, where
the tone becomes harsh). History's Mary Stuart was haunted by many ghosts
from the past, but anybody singing the role in Britain today need fear only
one: Janet Baker, whose performances in the 1970s are stamped on the memory
of all who saw them. Kenny is not in that league. Her Mary Stuart was
sometimes touching, sometimes beautiful, but never memorable.
There is a reasonable supporting cast. Peter Bronder was best when Leicester
was at his most forceful. Stafford Dean was a Cecil who delivered Mary's
sentence of death with suitably funereal tone; David Ellis made an adequate
Talbot. Richard Armstrong performed a more complete text of the opera than
usual and conducted it all with invigorating fervour. Some imaginative
decorations would have been welcome in the second verses, but this was not
primarily an evening for fans of trills and scales.
Lazaridis's intention (as producer and designer) was to give the audience
something to think about, a course which can backfire with Donizetti. Too
many arty ideas - like 'shadow queens' running about playing Mary and
Elizabeth in their youth - can sink a bel canto opera under the weight of
their own cleverness. Better just to play the opera as it stands. Never mind
about history. Donizetti rarely did.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Arts: Get Off My Foot] - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN SHUTTLEWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No fictional examination of stage comics and death can ever hope to achieve
the bizarre and disconcerting pitch of the late Tommy Cooper's demise -
literally, leaving them laughing. In their latest collaboration Get Off My
Foot], Phelim McDermott and Lee Simpson attempt simultaneously to muse on
the offstage agonies of funny men, to acknowledge various figures and double
acts from the heyday of variety and to exploit their joint talent for
creating work which mixes laughs with sporadic weird shivers.
From the beginning, Dougie Mason and Stanley Hardcastle make a strange
double act, not least because Dougie is dead (the show also recognises the
influence of Randall and Hopkirk Deceased). A series of flashbacks recount
key moments in their personal and professional relationship, enlightening
the amnesiac Dougie as to how and why he died. Dougie (McDermott) is
revealed as the demon of the pair: callous and single-minded, not hesitating
to fake a terminal disease if it will help him talk his way inside the
sequinned leotard of the new girl in the chorus. Tensions between him and
diligent but unambitious 'nice lad' Stanley come to a head when the alluring
but independent Angel (Linda Dobell) joins the act.
McDermott and Simpson's slightly disconcerting visual imagination is given
form by Alice Purcell's design. The only clearly-defined location is a
trompe-l'oeil rooming-house upstage, whose collapsible furniture and missing
walls offer enormous scope both for gags (Dougie proves he is a ghost by
walking through the fourth wall) and for violence. Supernatural effects are
enacted using scale models of the house and puppet protaganists, and are
executed with a wry self-consciousness which, by deflating such moments,
paradoxically makes them easier to swallow.
The snatches of Dougie and Stan's stage act (on which variety comedian Len
Lowe acted as adviser) are polished but unexceptional examples of the form.
Programme notes make much of the show's debt to 1940s Lancastrian jester
Frank Randle: his shade is written into the show as the guardian angel of
dead comics, and even its title derives from one of his catch-phrases.
Randle, though, has long been a fashionable name for heritage-minded
comedians to drop, and Get Off My Foot is both more and less than a
full-blown tribute either to him in particular or to past comedy acts in
general.
Like Dougie Mason, the piece itself exists in a strange theatrical limbo.
McDermott and Simpson's devised, clowning style is more familiar in a studio
setting, but the conventions of variety and the sheer physical resources
necessary for this production require a theatre the shape and at least the
size of Nottingham's Playhouse. When clowning company The Right Size made a
foray into middle-scale shows recently, its members found that the change of
size coarsened and attenuated both comic and sinister effect in their work,
and have now triumphantly returned to the top end of the studio bracket with
a double-act confection of their own. Get Off My Foot walks a fine line
between these two areas; the fact that it holds its own in these
surroundings testifies to its creators' precision in realising their ideas.
After all, bashing someone around the head with a frying pan can be a
surprisingly delicate matter.
At the Nottingham Playhouse until October 22 (0602 419419).

FT  11 OCT 94 / Arts: Mahler and Mutter - Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Michael Tilson Thomas's Mahler cycle at the Barbican approaches its
midpoint, we begin to have a clear overview of this conductor's strengths
and foibles. The former outweigh the latter by far, but Mahler shows
everything up, since he was a master conductor-composer.
On Sunday (and Monday) the London Symphony played the Fourth for him. It has
a dewier, more innocent surface than Tilson Thomas could make plausible: TT
never twinkles. The first movement, with its sleighbells, pranced and
curvetted artfully, every moment of it calculated to the hilt. The same
anxious care, applied to the great Poco adagio - here a Molto adagio - left
it gluey. TT lacks the gift of his master, Leonard Bernstein for drawing
'natural' playing from his orchestra; they sounded thoroughly practised,
hardly ever spontaneous.
Yet the Scherzo was dazzling, kaleidoscopic. TT revelled in bringing out
lines - a bassoon melody here, a string of pizzicati there - that nobody
else uncovers; the score churned with excitement. For the finale he had the
soprano Renee Fleming as soloist: lovely singing, but the voice is really
too womanly-mature for the child's-eye Wunderhorn sentiments. Earlier, she
had delivered Schubert's 'Shepherd on the Rock' with such fine grace as to
make it seem almost a good piece, abetted by Nicholas Rodwell's elegant
clarinet and TT at the piano.
That was part of a strange mixed first half, comprising Morton Feldman's The
Viola in my Life IV and a John Tavener premiere, The Myrrh-Bearer. Yuri
Bashmet was the peerless viola soloist in each. The Tavener is much the
usual mixture, with a semi-chorus whispering 'Kyrie Eleison' over and over
again beneath repetitive shouts from the main chorus, while the viola goes
floridly up and down a couple of scales for well over half an hour.
Bashmet made that sound almost interesting. He did as much for Feldman's
solo part, which plays almost continuously for 20 minutes while the
orchestra does Feldman's customary thing: deliberately, polemically
low-profile, apparently quite unstructured.
Two nights earlier, Anne-Sophie Mutter's violin recital in the same hall had
been remarkable chiefly for the height of her stiletto heels, surmounted by
a slinky black number. Miss Mutter is of course a performer of the highest
professional competence, and in the right repertoire - passionate virtuoso
stuff - she wields a scathing authority. Here, however, she essayed
Beethoven's last sonata, op. 96 in G, and Schumann's second-last, his op.
121 in D minor: the one mostly gentle and reflective, the other lean and
dramatic but formally patterned.
Her way with the Beethoven was to play it all sweetly, declining to read any
particular character in it. A 'soft, oleaginous mutter' indeed, though with
a very fast, sentimental vibrato applied to everything. Her svelte Schumann
had plenty of energy - but a work so full of repetitions should not have
them all repeated with such literal exactitude. A touch of waywardness is a
bonus in this sonata.
Aftersong, a workmanlike piece composed for Miss Mutter by the American
Sebastian Currier, gave her - and her excellent pianist Lambert Orkis - bold
things to do. Its heart remained in Samuel Barber territory, its nerves
recalled Walton; Messiaen surfaced later on. There was more red-blooded
music in the suite Stravinsky arranged from his Pulcinella, pastiche though
it partly is. They played not the familiar arrangement for Dushkin, but an
earlier, more virtuosic one Stravinsky made for Szymanowski's violinist Paul
Kochanski: and they delivered it with engaging flair.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Technology: Creating false images - The latest software
makes it possible to alter photographs digitally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forget the adage that the camera never lies. The latest generation of image
editing software makes it possible to alter photographs digitally so well
that it is virtually impossible to spot the change.
This technology is creating an entirely new image-editing industry - and
raising legal and social questions. Time magazine recently drew criticism
over a digitally altered photograph of OJ Simpson, the US football star
accused of murder. Critics said the altered picture made him look menacing.
Vancouver-based Western Pro Imaging Labs has launched a service for divorced
people called DivorceX that allows them to digitally 'cut out' their
ex-spouses from family photos. Keith Guelpha, the company's president, says
the gaps are filled in with elements of the existing background. It is also
possible to place a new partner in the photo once a former spouse has been
removed.
The technology is standard off-the-shelf equipment - a personal computer, a
good colour scanner, some powerful image-editing software and the ability to
output to photographic paper, film or colour laser devices.
Unlike traditional methods of re-touching photographs, which require
considerable skills, in digital image editing most of the hard work is done
using a system costing only a few thousand dollars.
Photographs can also be altered to change features - people can be made
thinner, fatter, or younger. They can acquire a firmer chin or lose a scar.
'A normal person would never be able to tell the difference,' says Guelpha.
'If it's a good picture to start with, the blending is seamless.'
With the advent of digital photography (using products such as Apple
Computer's QuickTake digital camera), the 'real' image may never even hit
photographic paper before it is edited on the computer screen. The image,
stored digitally in the camera's memory, can be transmitted directly into a
PC.
The industry itself is conscious of the potential for misuse of digital
imaging. For example, 'polishing' photographs throws doubt on the legal use
of photographic evidence.
Guelpha says he takes care to ensure his digitally-altered photographs are
for legal purposes only.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Technology: Charged up for zero emissions - AEG's plans for
high-performance batteries for electric cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an upstairs room in AEG's Berlin works in Sickingenstrasse, a trainee
robot is making a hash of inserting a strip of metal into a stainless steel
tube. Its minder frowns, tweaks a button, makes a note. The automaton tries
again, misses, and bends the strip into an elegant 'J'.
It is one of a dozen or so in the early stages of programming for a venture
into high-performance battery manufacture, which the loss-making
Daimler-Benz subsidiary hopes will give it a charge of profitability in the
budding market for electrically-powered passenger cars.
The robot stands at the front of a fully-automated, DM20m (Pounds 8.1m)
pilot assembly line producing sodium/nickel chloride cells for assembly into
batteries weighing up to 300kg.
AEG claims it is the first company in the world to start series manufacture
of high-performance batteries. Despite widespread scepticism about the
weight, efficiency and high prices of electric drive technology for road
vehicles - a 300kg battery is expected to cost DM15,000 - it plans to stay
ahead of the rest. The intention is to build a full-scale plant to make
15,000 so-called Zebra batteries a year, opening in 1998.
Zebra - zero emission batteries research activity - is the first fruit of a
joint venture dating back to 1988 between AEG and the South African Anglo
American Group, which owns the technology patents.
The initial aim of the project was to produce power sources for fork-lifts,
diesel-electric vehicles and stationary units, but the project has gained
momentum following Californian legislation that insists that as of 1998, at
least 2 per cent of car makers' sales in the state must be zero-emission
vehicles. At current registration levels, that represents 20,000 cars a
year. The quota is scheduled to rise to 10 per cent by 2003.
Test results and support from vehicle makers have also been encouraging. On
a weight-for-weight basis, AEG says the batteries deliver up to four times
more power than conventional lead-acid units. In tests on the flat Baltic
island of Rugen, its power packs have proved capable of providing up to
150km range between charges.
Considering that they have been tested in conventional heavy car bodies, AEG
feels this is pretty good. It claims that vehicle manufacturers agree,
noting that of the 60 test cars of various makes scooting silently around
Rugen, 31 are fitted with Zebra power packs. Trials also show that the
batteries can be recharged up to 1,500 times - exceeding the vehicle makers'
minimum requirement of 1,000 - and are good for more than 100,000km.
In its own modest way, the Zebra project contributes to Daimler-Benz's
tarnished ambition of becoming an integrated technology group, drawing
together skills and technologies from disparate sectors of the concern.
The batteries' metal parts and pressings come mainly from Mercedes-Benz. The
core element - a special aluminium hydroxide ceramic electrolyte - is made
by a group subsidiary in the UK. Assembly techniques for such materials are
a particular speciality of the Sickingenstrasse works, which manufactures
more workaday filled-ceramic products such as capa-citors for fluorescent
light fittings.
Customers for the pilot plant's output of 450 batteries a year include Adam
Opel, BMW, Toyota and, naturally, Mercedes-Benz, AEG's more successful
sister company, although none has yet ordered commercial-scale deliveries.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Technology: A model range - CD-Roms are making life easier
for a number of businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At its Face of 1994 competition at the Grosvenor House last week, Storm
Management became the first UK model agency to put its portfolio on CD-Roms,
small plastic discs on which vast amounts of information can be stored and
retrieved.
The CD-Roms, which showed 250 models (six images of each), together with
some video clips, were given 'a tremendous response' by the photographers
and casting directors present, according to Simon Chambers, a Storm
director.
Instead of thumbing through a bulky catalogue, Storm's clients are now able
to search the database looking for models that meet a particular criteria
such as height or hair colour. Moreover, the CD-Rom is cheaper to mail than
Storm's glossy brochure, allowing the agency to send out quarterly updates.
The model catalogue is one example of the way in which CD-Rom technology is
making inroads into business. An expanding range of business CD-Rom titles
are being produced by companies for their own use and by external
publishers.
Many large companies now have CD-Rom libraries which stock annual reports,
newspapers, legal information, market research and reference works, as well
as producing their own discs for marketing or training purposes. Although
specialist discs can cost thousands of pounds, prices can be less than
Pounds 1 a disc for companies printing them in large volumes.
Within businesses the potential for CD-Roms is most likely to be seen in
sales departments, which are keen to exploit the ability to combine text,
video, sound and graphics.
'Sales people are clamouring for multimedia presentation tools,' says Todd
Harris, editor-in-chief of CD-Rom World, a magazine based in Westport,
Connecticut.
Training departments are also enthusiastic users of CD-Roms. For example, in
April 1993, Abbey National, the UK building society, replaced computer-based
training with CD-Rom training packages because of their stronger visual
impact and their interactivity.
Hyster Europe, the forklift truck distributor, has distributed training
information on CD-Rom to dealers throughout Europe. It found that even small
workshops were prepared to invest in the hardware to use the discs. 'There
was far less resistance than we initially expected,' says Roy Jackson,
dealer support co-ordinator.
CD-Rom technology also allows companies to present vast amounts of
information in a manageable and revisable form. Price Waterhouse, the
accountancy firm, uses quarterly-updated CD-Roms to alert its staff to
changes in accounting and legal regulations throughout the world.
Many companies are putting their technical manuals on CD-Rom. The RAC has
invested Pounds 500,000 in storing its patrol teams' technical manuals on
CD-Rom using Panasonic 'electronic book' players.
The discs, which replace 30m sheets of paper a year, are able to store extra
information, including local car dealerships and members' entitlements.
Because patrols no longer have to carry bulky manuals, they are able to fit
in an extra part or passenger into a car. Pilot trials suggest also that the
electronic books are easier to use, allowing patrols to fix more faults at
the roadside.
The proliferation of CD-Rom titles is also fuelled by publishers.
Mecklermedia, a publisher based in London and Westport, Connecticut, which
produces a directory, CD-Roms in Print, calculates that the number of
published titles has reached nearly 6,000, up from 3,500 last year.
Many of these titles use the immense storage capacity of CD-Roms to
accommodate large databases, telephone directories and mailing lists on a
single disc, which makes them a useful tool for direct marketers.
Training packages are also popular, with titles such as the New Dynamics of
Winning and The Secrets of Executive Success. Another category of CD-Roms
are those which provide graphics to help with desktop publishing and
business presentations.
Detailed information on companies and industries is also available - for a
price. For example, Kompass UK, with details on 140,000 top companies, costs
Pounds 4,200. Pira International, the UK paper and packaging industry's
research association, has launched a disc that includes market statistics,
company profiles and new products for Pounds 2,570 a year.
Many of these CD-Rom titles run on Windows or Macintosh, which are
relatively easy to use. However, many discs aimed at the business market are
known as 'professional' CDs, which often have complicated command
structures. Some discs have limited access, either in the number of times it
is used or the length of time it can be used.
The number of available titles is likely to increase as CD-Rom players are
more widely used. At present, only 7 per cent of PCs installed have CD-Rom
players, according to Primary Research, a New York-based company.
'Although the total number of CD-Roms is small, we expect to see an
explosion in their number,' says Harris.
The surge in the amount of information available from CD-Roms and on-line
information services is giving businesses quicker and easier access to more
information than ever before. But at the same time, it is making the task of
sifting and filtering the data more acute.
'People are beginning to feel distressed by the volume of data sources
available to them. The major challenge now is managing the provision of
information,' says Toby Stephens, a senior manager at Price Waterhouse's
technology group.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Forging links of survival
 -Europe's single market can provide a rescue route for companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In its heyday in the late 1980s, Pershke Price Service, a privately-owned
distributor of printing machinery in the UK, had sales of more than Pounds
70m and employed 340 people. Then, as with many companies in the printing
industry, recession hit with a vengeance. Plans to list on the USM were put
on the back-burner. The workforce was cut by one-third, sales halved and the
company is only now profitable again after losses in two of the last three
years.
But this week the prospect of a considerably brighter future for PPS came
with the announcement of a significant merger, made possible by the opening
up of Europe's single market.
After nearly a year of delicate talks led by accountants KPMG, PPS and seven
other mainly family-owned European companies have formed a new company -
Omnigraph Group NV - in the Netherlands. It will have annual sales of Pounds
250m.
The group will initially combine all the operations of its eight member
companies, which already all distribute MAN Roland equipment; they will
expand to sell pre-press and post-press equipment from other suppliers.
Also, to reduce dependence on equipment sales, which experience has shown
are highly vulnerable during recession, Omnigraph will place greater
emphasis on sales of consumable items such as rollers.
Chris Marks, until the merger the chief executive of PPS and now one of
three directors on Omnigraph's executive board, says the new company will
have an international network similar to those run by the competition.
The main distributor for MAN Roland's large competitor, Heidelberger,
already operates through a single European distributor, Dutch-based
Buhrmann-Tetterode.
'A lot of our customers are investing in the graphic arts business across
borders,' says Marks. Customers do not want to talk (to their distributors)
country by country.'
The move also gives PPS's shareholders - the Werkmeister family and Montagu
Private Equity - a considerably increased chance of floating the company.
'One of the major driving forces behind creating a European company of this
size is the intention that we will go to the market in three to four years,'
says Marks.
The driving force behind the merger was the creation of Dutch paper giant
KNP BT, which was formed early last year when KNP, Buhrmann-Tetterode and
VRG amalgamated. This merger gave KNP BT a stake in distributors of both MAN
Roland and Heidelberger equipment, which together had more than 80 per cent
of the Belgian and Dutch market, a situation the European Commission would
not allow.
KNP BT responded by injecting its interests in the Dutch and Belgian
distributors into Omnigraph, where it will play no part on the executive
board.
Corporate financiers say, however, that the gradual arrival of a level
playing field in Europe may make similar transnational mergers more common
and give private as well as quoted companies something to consider.
Many companies - like PPS - suffered both volume and margin falls in the
recession. While volume might be returning, retrieving margin may be more
difficult. This is particularly true in the printing machinery industry,
where Japanese distributors quickly built market share when established
European press manufacturers could not meet demand in the 1980s.
The only way they might be able to regain margin is by exploiting synergies
by combining stocks of parts and engineering support.
For controlling families, the prospect of the loss of control is not easy.
'It is a break of a long family tradition,' Marks says. 'But in today's
world it is difficult for family businesses with high capital requirements
to maintain long-term independence.'

FT  11 OCT 94 / Management (The Growing Business): How to nurture smart
ideas / A look at alternative ways of ensuring that bright inventions reach
their potential market

The Lion King, Walt Disney's latest animated epic, opened last week in the
UK with all the hype of a film that has already taken US box offices by
storm. Like each new Disney release, the latest extravaganza is packed with
ground-breaking techniques to captivate audiences and animators alike.
While The Lion King, by most accounts, reinforces Disney's position as the
world's pre-eminent animator, a small UK company, Cambridge Animation
Systems, hopes it has developed new software that will dramatically change
the way many cartoons are made.
Apart from the cleverness of the software, now surrounded by patents,
Cambridge Animation has taken one crucial step. It has recognised there is
little value in developing a wonderful new product if it cannot reach its
market and support it. As a result the company will today announce it has
raised Pounds 500,000 of new equity from venture capitalists 3i, to add to
Pounds 300,000 raised earlier this year from Jafco, Japan's largest venture
capital group, and the company's original institutional investor, Korda &amp;
Co.
'One of the reasons products are jeopardised is that entrepreneurs are not
prepared to raise enough money to get the product to market,' says Ruth
McCall, one of three founders of Cambridge Animation.
The three founders set about developing the Animo suite of products in late
1990 when they saw that automation had hardly touched the production of
two-dimensional cartoon animation.
While some companies were using software to computerise the simplest and
most repetitive part of the process - the 'in-betweening' where pen and ink
are used to colour hundreds of different acetates - no one had attempted to
computerise the whole process while leaving the animator room for
creativity.
As a result, many animators ship work to studios in the Philippines, Vietnam
and China where there is a significant labour cost advantage but where
control of the process and quality is greatly reduced. Animo says its
product will remove the cost disadvantage and increase quality, helping to
repatriate animation work to Europe.
The Animo software is being assessed by Nelvana of Canada and Warner Feature
Films, which are about to computerise parts of their animation studios. In
the case of Warner, Cambridge Animation is up against US Animation in Los
Angeles and Soft Image Co in Montreal, both of which offer software which
McCall claims does less of the animation process.
But a year ago they needed more cash to support the product, to introduce it
at trade shows and open sales and maintenance offices in the US and Japan.
Hence, the Pounds 1m of new capital.
Cambridge Animation's strategy for developing and exploiting its idea was
fairly traditional - a straight approach to investors. But there are also a
number of government initiatives designed to increase the rate at which
high-tech ideas are developed and commercialised.
At a European level, the Commission's Value programme aims to disseminate
the results of European Union funded research and to exploit its potential
across borders and across industries. The programme, administered through 27
Value Relay Centres - four in the UK - is part of the Third Framework
programme of research and technological development, which is due to be
upgraded in December.
One beneficiary of the programme is Oxford Computer Services, a software
developer and IT consultancy set up by university academics. For the past
three years, the company and nine European partners have been collaborating
on a Ecu3m (Pounds 2.36m) project to develop engineering software that aids
the design and increases the applications of computer co-ordinated
manufacturing techniques.
The so-called MCOES system is being used by Valmet in Finland, which
manufactures paper-making machinery, but otherwise the consortium had no
customers.
'We had the software but it was a long way from workstations and being
packaged,' says JO Thomas, director of Oxford Computer Services. 'So we
approached the Value programme. We asked them to look for end users -
factories where it might be installed - and we asked can MCOES be used for
existing Cad-cam companies?'
As a result of the introduction from Technology Broker, the Cambridge-based
Value Relay Centre, Oxford Computer Services is negotiating to install its
been put in touch with EDS Unigraphics, part of the giant US computer
services group now a subsidiary of General Motors.
'The Technology Broker has been extremely effective,' says Thomas. 'This has
been a genuine attempt to try to fill the gap between the invention process
and having a product people can buy.'
Jean-Noel Durvy, the Commission's co-ordinator of the Value programme,
expects ministers at the Research Council in early December to approve a
replacement for the Value programme under the Fourth Framework. This will
combine the goals of Value and the Sprint programme, which focuses on
encouraging technology transfer in the community.
The previous Value programmes were limited to EU funded research. But the
new programme is expected to have a budget of about Ecu290m over five years
and will attempt to encourage the dissemination and exploitation of any
community-based research through an expanded network of Relay Centres.
Government support is also available at a national level. In the UK, the
Department of Trade and Industry offers support at two stages during an
idea's development. Its Smart awards - the Small Firms Merit Award for
Research and Technology for companies with up to 50 employees  - first helps
the development of ideas with grants awarded through regionally-based
competitions, and then offers a large second grant to help
commercialisation.
Since the Smart awards were launched in 1986, more than 1,000 companies have
been helped through the regionally-based competition and the DTI has given
grants of Pounds 66m. A similar Spur award - Support for Products Under
Research - is available to companies with up to 250 employees and has
provided Pounds 36m of assistance to more than 400 projects since it was
launched in 1991.
This kind of programme of support has been widely applauded. One
Newcastle-based company, Novocastra Laboratories, says it could not have
developed without Smart.
The company was set up by Professor Wilson Horne, professor of pathology at
Newcastle University. It has won seven Smart awards to develop and
commercialise its process for the manufacture of monoclonal antibodies used
by research establishments worldwide. After seven awards the DTI has said it
will not be winning any more competitions.
Brian Angus, another academic and director of Novocastra, says the support
from the university, which took only 20 per cent of the equity, was crucial.
But so was the Smart programme. 'There was very strong financial support
through Smart for the development of new ideas to a point where it might be
commercialised,' says Angus.
'Most of the things they have funded have yielded a commercial return. It
has been a great help to a company that started with no commercial capital.'
Novocastra is expecting sales of Pounds 1m this year from the 20 products it
has developed and the 200 it sells on behalf of others.
While the DTI and - increasingly - the EU are becoming more aware of the
need to commercialise the fruits of Europe's intellectual capital, some of
their efforts remain bureacratic.
McCall recalls an approach Cambridge Animation made to the EU Cartoon
Initiative, part of the Commission's effort to support the union's
audio-visual industry. Cambridge Animation asked for funding for a studio to
make a cartoon feature film using an early version of its software.
Eighteen months later - when Cambridge Animation had already completed most
of the development work - McCall says the Cartoon Initiative came back with
the idea that it would 'fund a study' of the uses of new technology in the
animation industry.
Some officials trying to support the commercialisation of products still
have to learn that 'late' is rarely better than 'never' in fast moving
global markets.

FT  11 OCT 94 / People: Scottish food retailer takes life easier
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gordon Baxter is retiring as chairman of Baxters of Speyside, the family
soup and jams producer, which he has expanded from employing 11 people in
1946 to a payroll of 600 today. He is handing over at the age of 76 to Joe
Barnes, who was joint managing director of the retailer J Sainsbury until
1990.
Baxters' products - such as its well known Royal Game Soup - are made at its
base at Fochabers in northeast Scotland. It claims to dominate the premium
end of the UK soup market. Last year it had sales of Pounds 38.46m, on which
it made profits of Pounds 3.7m.
Although the business was founded by Gordon's grandfather in 1868, its real
growth took place after the second world war. Gordon is considered an
inspired marketeer who has built up excellent contacts in the UK food
industry, while his wife Ena devised some of the most successful recipes.
The company is 98.6 per cent owned by the Baxter family and Gordon says the
tally of takeover approaches he has rejected now stands at 172. 'We give
them a nice reception, may even take them fishing on the Spey, but send them
away empty-handed,' he says. He expects the company, which has no debt, to
remain in family hands for another generation.
Barnes, 64, will be part time chairman for two or three years and will train
a family successor. Gordon says this is likely to be his son Andrew, 35, now
group deputy chairman. Andrew's sister Audrey, 33, is group managing
director.
Gordon Baxter's retirement will not be restful. He will handle the group's
corporate public relations and links with leading figures in worldwide food
retailing, as well as supervise the busy visitor centre at Fochabers.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Business and the Law: First cases clarify role of Efta Court
 -Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The kind of issues which will occupy the Efta Court, set up to settle
disputes relating to the European Economic Area Agreement, are becoming
clearer, as the Geneva-based tribunal takes on its first cases.
The Swedish Supreme Court has asked it for a ruling on the application of
Swedish procedural rules in a case brought by a UK company against Swedish
defendants.
The Supreme Court wants to know whether requiring the UK company to provide
security for costs - a deposit of money against legal costs if the company
loses - is contrary to the EEA Agreement, and in particular the prohibition
of discrimination on grounds of nationality, since no corresponding
requirement may be imposed on Swedish nationals.
Two cases concerning television advertising in Sweden have also been
referred to the Efta court by the Swedish Market Court. The Market Court has
asked for an advisory opinion on whether the EEA agreement and the EU
directive on 'Television without frontiers' prevent action being taken
against TV advertisements shown in Sweden but transmitted from elsewhere in
the EEA.

FT  11 OCT 94 / People: Sword gives edge to Hall's board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Sword, former chief executive of Massey Ferguson, has joined the board
of Hall Engineering (Holdings), taking over as managing director of the
Shrewsbury-based group on October 31.
Hall, whose interests range from steel stockholding to construction products
and automotive engineering, head-hunted Sword. The current managing
director, Brian Hinkins, retires this month having reached 65. He will stay
on the board until next April's annual general meeting.
Sword, 51, below, is a well-known name in industry, especially in
agricultural and construction equipment, after 11 years at Massey. He left
the Midlands-based, US-owned tractor maker in July last year and spent
several months developing a Pounds 230m buy-out of the company from its
parent, Varity Corporation.
To Sword's intense disappointment, however, Varity sold Massey this April to
Atlanta-based Agco, even though the European investor group led by Sword
claimed to be offering a higher price.
Sword has a strong management record from his years at Massey, and in a
previous nine-year spell at GEC, where he was managing director of Ruston
Diesels on Merseyside.
Appointed to run Ruston at the age of 30, Sword transformed its fortunes,
quadrupling sales and restoring profitability.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Business and the Law: Advantages of the City - Robert Rice
investigates London's competitive edge in legal services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As London's commercial law firms climb slowly out of recession, they appear
to be facing a period of great uncertainty and change.
A spate of aggressive hiring of English lawyers by large US law firms has
left many wondering whether they are facing increased competition in the
commercial legal market from a new breed of multinational partnerships.
Others are concerned by the interest being shown by the six large
accountancy firms in legal services. Many medium-sized commercial firms, in
particular, are left wondering where precisely, if anywhere, they fit into
this brave new world.
A report*, on the competitive advantage of law and accountancy in the City,
should provide them with some comfort. The report, by Professor John Kay,
chairman of economic consultants London Economics, was published on Friday
as part of the three-year City Research Project. The project, set up last
November by the Corporation of London, the local authority for the City of
London, and managed by the London Business School, is designed to look into
London's competitive position in international financial services.
Prof Kay concludes that the future structure of the commercial legal
services market will not change greatly. The competitive advantage enjoyed
by City law firms is based on factors which will be sustained and are
sustainable, says the report.
Prof Kay's starting point was to ask whether the structure of the legal
services industry is different from other professional services industries,
such as accountancy.
A quick comparison between law and accountancy shows the markets are
different. Accountancy is dominated by the Big Six partnerships and produces
an international product similar to manufactured products such as cars. The
legal market is fragmented and the product is basically national in
character. City law firms derive almost 50 per cent of their turnover from
non-UK clients, but the product they export is English law.
Turnover figures for the top 20 accountancy firms and law firms in the UK in
1993 illustrate the point. The Big Six accountants had a combined turnover
of about of Pounds 2.5bn - or a market share of 80 per cent - and the 14
second-tier firms a turnover of just Pounds 511m. In law, the top six firms
had a turnover of Pounds 844m, only slightly more than the second-tier
firms' Pounds 756m.
The City's law and accountancy firms are pre-eminent internationally. But
their approaches to delivering international services differ.
There are basically three models of internationalisation, according to Prof
Kay. The first is epitomised by aircraft maker Boeing, which, from a large
domestic production base in Seattle, exports its products around the world.
The second model is represented by General Motors, which operates and sells
in different places around the the world - a model based on global
production and local sales. The third model is typified by Hertz car rental,
where the product is global but mainly produced and sold locally.
Accountancy, he says follows the Hertz model - international firms attach
their names to local products and local producers, with most of the benefits
going to the local partner. Probably less than 25 per cent of the revenues
of City accountancy firms originates overseas.
Legal services are closer to the Boeing model. City law firms export legal
services from London, with most of the benefits returning to the UK and the
firms based there.
The reason for the difference in the structure of the two industries lies in
the nature of their products: in particular, legal services and audits.
Audits are unusual, he says, because regulations force companies to have
them. The incentives of the purchaser are not the same, therefore, as in
legal services.
In legal services, the purchaser is looking for the best product in the
marketplace or the best product for its current needs. Quality and expertise
are the most important factors for clients.
In accountancy, adequacy not excellence is the priority, he says.
Accountants provide services that meet the standards required at local
levels and make no differentiation between products.
The reasons for buying legal services are more diverse and more related to
local need. That does not mean clients are not concerned with value for
money. But they do not buy legal services because regulations force them to.
They buy because they need them.
Given that the legal services industry has a different structure from other
professional industries, does it need to change to succeed in the 1990s?
Prof Kay says not. In spite of the increasing internationalisation of many
professional activities, the majority of legal advice is still provided by
law firms which concentrate on their domestic jurisdiction.
The demand for legal advice in relation to international financial market
transactions is mostly directed to English and US law firms, whose common
law systems are best suited to the purpose. English and US firms also have
substantial experience of international transactions and are big enough to
cope with complex deals.
Since law firms operate in a transaction-based market, the strength of City
law firms in respect of international financial deals lies in the
competitive environment they can offer to clients around the world. This is
provided by the English legal system, the pre-eminence of London as a
financial centre, and their reputation for efficiency in handling
documentation.
The competitive advantages enjoyed by the large City law firms - a de facto
monopoly on English law and their location in London, where a large number
of primary international financial institutions are based - are unlikely to
vanish overnight, says Prof Kay.
There is therefore unlikely to be any significant change in the structure of
the legal services market in the near future. There may be some further
moves towards internationalisation, but if firms do open overseas offices it
will generally only be where their expertise and reputation acquired in
London offer a unique selling point.
Prof Kay says there may be further concentration of law firms, but this will
not be rapid as the base is too fragmented and there is little demand for
larger law firms.
The threat from US firms is overstated, he says. In the short term, there is
little prospect of US firms hiring lawyers of sufficient standing to pose a
threat to the practice of English law by English firms.
The future of large City law firms, therefore, seems secure - at least while
London maintains its prominence as an international financial and commercial
centre.

Court

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice has been re-constituted. Six members have
retired, one has moved from the post of advocate-general to that of judge,
and three new judges and three new advocates-general have been appointed.
None of the appointees, announced last week, were women, leaving the Court
once again all male.
One of the Court's first tasks was the election of its president. Spain's
Judge Rodriguez Iglesias was chosen to replace the retiring Judge Ole Due.
Judge Rodriguez Iglesias was an academic prior to joining the Court in 1986.
The new judges are Antonio La Pergola, Jean-Pierre Puissochet and Gunter
Hirsch, together with Claus Gulmann, who moved from advocate-general to
judge. The new advocates-general are Georgios Cosmas, Philippe Leger and
Michael Elmer.
The new appointees come from a variety of legal backgrounds, but all have
judicial experience in their own countries.
Community preference in
the banana market lawful
In one of the last judgments of the old Court, the European Union's 'common
organisation' (CO) of the banana market was held to be lawful in spite of
the preferential treatment given to traditional banana producers from
African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.
The CO banana market was established in 1993. Prior to the CO's formation,
member states followed different rules on banana imports. Some states placed
restrictions on non-EU or non-ACP bananas, others did not. Germany, in
particular, imported bananas from non-ACP sources. Because of structural
deficiencies in their markets, EU and ACP bananas were more expensive than
those from third countries.
The CO set up a quota system under which traditional ACP producers enjoyed
duty-free access to the EU market for a specific quantity of bananas. Quotas
were also established for bananas from third countries and non-traditional
ACP producers. All third-country bananas were subject to import duties,
while banana imports from non-traditional ACP producers were liable to duty
once the relevant quota had been exhausted. The effect of these changes was
to increase the price of bananas in, for instance, Germany. As a result,
Germany lodged an application to annul the quota system.
Germany alleged that the new system had led to procedural violations. These
included the Council of Ministers' adoption of regulations which were
contrary to the European Commission's original proposal, without first
receiving a modified Commission proposal.
The Court ruled the Commission had agreed to a modified proposal being put
before the Council; the fact that such an agreement was not in writing was
irrelevant. The Court said the EU's legislative process was characterised by
an informality which was necessary if a convergence of views was to be
achieved between the EU's institutions. However, this approach was not
relevant to actions which directly concerned individuals, for which strict
rules were necessary.
Germany also alleged there had been breaches of the Rome treaty, such as
those those relating to the provisions on agriculture as well as the
principle of 'non-discrimination' and 'proportionality'.
The Court said the agricultural objectives of the Rome treaty had to be seen
in the context of the EU market as a whole, not in the context of a single
member state.
On the issue of non-discrimination, the Court ruled that although the new
system treated banana importers differently, such differentiation was
inherent in the CO's objective of integrating previously closed national
markets.
On proportionality, the Court found that although other methods of attaining
the same goals could not be ruled out, on the particular issue of the
adequacy of the measures taken, the Court could not substitute its views for
the Council's.
Germany also alleged breaches of the Lome Convention for trade with the
third world, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the banana
protocol for the EU's overseas territories. None was upheld.

John Jackson, 47, who led Richard Branson's unsuccessful bid for the UK
National Lottery project, has been appointed chief executive of Sketchley,
the dry-cleaning and film processing group with around 800 retail outlets.
Sketchley, which was losing Pounds 800,000 a month when it was rescued by
Tony Bloom and John Richardson in 1990, has been looking for a chief
executive for some time. Richardson, 51, former chief executive of Hong
Kong's Hutchison Whampoa, is returning to Hong Kong at the end of the month
to work for BZW and Bloom, 55, a former chief executive of South Africa's
Premier Group and Sketchley's other deputy chairman, intends to become
non-executive after next year's annual meeting.
Jackson, an accountant, worked for Bristol-Myers for 14 years before joining
Chesebrough Pond's. In 1986 he was recruited by Virgin's Richard Branson to
be his special project director. Two years later was appointed managing
director of Body Shop International. In May 1993 he quit Body Shop and
rejoined Branson to mastermind Virgin's bid for the UK National Lottery
project.

FT  11 OCT 94 / People: Hickson chooses Hann as chairman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
James Hann, the outspoken chairman of Scottish Nuclear, has taken the helm
at Hickson International following the speciality chemical company's
six-month search for a successor to Sir Gordon Jones.
The 61-year old Wykehamist, below, will remain part-time chairman of the
state-owned nuclear power company, but is expected to spend two days a week
with the Castleford-based chemicals group.
'His understanding of the safety management culture and policies of one of
the UK's major nuclear companies will be of great value,' said Sir Gordon,
67, who announced his decision to retire in March.
Hickson refused to disclose details of Hann's package or whether it would
match the Pounds 60,000 paid last year to Sir Gordon, who is also chairman
of Yorkshire Water and The Water Industries Association. By comparison, the
Scottish Nuclear chairman earned Pounds 34,439.
Earlier this year, Hann criticised the government for slowing Scottish
Nuclear's transformation into a more commercial operation.
'Every time our industry tries to move forward it is being halted in its
tracks as a result of operating in the public sector,' he said at the time.
Before joining Scottish Nuclear in 1990, he was chief executive at Seaforth
Maritime, the offshore oil and gas business.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Sheehy, 64, expected to retire as chairman of BAT Industries in
a year's time, has joined the board of Asda Property Holdings, a small
property company controlled by the family of Manny Davidson, the founder.
The company was named after Davidson's mother, Annie Sara Davidson.
Asda Property has survived the recession better than many property companies
and is one of the few not to have lost money. Tony Roscoe, Asda's managing
director, said: 'We can make money out of property in a static property
market but the firm wanted to make sure it did not miss the bigger picture'.
He added that recruiting Sir Patrick would help reassure the company's
outside shareholders.
Sir Patrick takes over from Lord Finsberg, former Tory MP for Hampstead, who
retired earlier this year. Sir Patrick already sits on the boards of BP and
Cluff Resources.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Mark Thatcher a marginal middleman in Pounds 20bn deal:
Political manoeuvres behind the sale of fighter aircraft to Saudi Arabia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was US politicians rather than middlemen such as Mr Mark Thatcher who
gave Britain its first foot in the door for the Pounds 20bn Al Yamamah arms
deal with Saudi Arabia.
If the strong Jewish lobby had not persuaded Congress to veto the sale of US
F-15 fighters to the kingdom Britain would probably never have had the
chance to negotiate the deal.
Once the veto had been applied Britain was in a very strong position to
supply the Saudis with advanced fighter aircraft. The UK had a long-standing
defence relationship with Saudi Arabia, stretching back to the supply and
maintenance of 46 Lightning aircraft in the 1960s.
Baroness Thatcher, visited the kingdom when prime minister and made a strong
impact on King Fahd. Personal relationships between leaders are very
important in the Gulf. The French, the other potential suppliers, had no
such pull.
So in 1984-85, with the Gulf war between Iran and Iraq raging near their
northern border and concerns about the spread of Islamic fundamentalism
growing, the Saudis were keen to improve their defences as quickly as
possible. The way was open for the UK to strike a deal.
The three main British negotiators for Al Yamamah were Sir Colin Chandler,
then head of the government's defence export services organisation (DESO),
previously a marketing chief of British Aerospace and now chief executive of
Vickers; Mr Dick Evans, the marketing head of British Aerospace and now its
chief executive; and Lady Thatcher herself.
Lady Thatcher did not have particularly close links to the BAe executives,
although all involved were obviously keen to secure the order. It was Lady
Thatcher's link to King Fahd which was the motor for the deal.
The British team used Mr Wafic Said, a London-based Saudi, as the
go-between, and he brought Lady Thatcher's son Mark into the deal. If his
intention was to make sure of his mother's support, he need hardly have
bothered, as the prime minister was keen on the idea anyway.
One official involved at the time said: 'Mark certainly tried to generate
the impression that he had influence. He was putting himself around a lot.
But in practice I think he didn't have much pull.'
A former director of BAe said: 'Mrs Thatcher's intervention was crucial, but
she came in at the request of BAe, not as a result of Mark Thatcher's
efforts.'
The outline Al Yamamah deal was concluded in September 1985, with the full
contract signed the following year. It was a government-to-government deal,
with BAe nominated as the company primarily responsible for the business.
Commissions were paid to middlemen as a result of the deal. Mr Said insists
he was not paid a commission, but an ex-BAe director said: 'Commissions
would have been paid on the deal. I do not know if Mr Thatcher received
money, but I wouldn't rule it out.'
Saudi Arabia agreed to buy 72 Tornado aircraft, a mixture of the air defence
fighters and ground attack bombers, and 60 Hawk advance trainers and PC9
basic training aircraft. A big package of training and support services was
included in the deal - BAe has had about 4,500 personnel in Saudi Arabia
working on the Al Yamamah deal ever since.
Instead of cash, the Saudis paid in oil - initially set at 400,000 barrels a
day, which soon increased to 500,000 as the oil price weakened.
The oil was paid into a central fund in the UK, controlled by a Saudi
Arabian project office at the ministry of defence. The oil was sold on the
market at the project office's discretion, and BAe could draw on the funds
as it met milestones in the project.
Since the contract was started in 1986 it has brought in more than Pounds
2bn a year to BAe. Because the oil revenues were sometimes insufficient to
meet the project costs the fund has twice been topped up with cash - once in
1992 to the tune of Pounds 1.5bn.
In 1988 a second contract was negotiated for a further 48 Tornado aircraft
and associated training aircraft, as well as a large new airbase at Al
Sulayil, which was to cover an area the size of greater London. However, oil
prices continued to be weak and the plan for the air base was eventually
dropped.
As a result of budgetary pressures the second deal was not signed until
January 1993, just six months before the Tornado production line was due to
close. It was initially for the 48 ground attack Tornado aircraft, with
training aircraft to follow. To pay for the extra equipment the daily oil
output was increased to 600,000 barrels.
The second batch of Tornado aircraft is due to be delivered between 1996 and
1999, and some of the Hawk and PC9 training aircraft to go with them were
ordered at the Farnborough Air Show last month.
BAe remains confident that Britain will retain a strong defence link to
Saudi Arabia. The company even hopes to sell the Saudis its newest
Eurofighter in time. Al Yamamah III, however, is still a long way off.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Lottery tickets on sale next month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tickets for the National Lottery are to go on sale for the first time on
November 14 - just six days before the first multimillion-pound weekly draw.
The Pounds 1 tickets will be available initially at about 10,000 outlets all
over the UK.
As well as announcing the date for the launch of ticket sales, Camelot, the
consortium operating the National Lottery, also announced the introduction
of a new tier of weekly prizes of about Pounds 100,000.
Until now there was a wide gap between the likely first prize of as much as
Pounds 2m and smaller prizes ranging from Pounds 10 to about Pounds 1,500.
The new prize, inserted to increase interest, will be awarded on the basis
of drawing an additional numbered ball. To win the first prize a lottery
player must correctly choose six numbers out of a total of 49 in any order.
A player who has chosen five of the correct numbers will be able to win a
Pounds 100,000 prize if the seventh produces the missing correct number.
Mr David Rigg, a director of Camelot, said yesterday: 'The bonus number adds
to the excitement and should increase the number of big winners on the
National Lottery each week.' The consortium brings together the food and
drinks group Cadbury Schweppes, computer company ICL, the security printer
De La Rue, Racal Electronics and GTech, the US manufacturer of lottery
equipment.
The special computer terminals needed to play the Lottery will be located in
high street stores which range from Tesco and J. Sainsbury to WH Smith and
Woolworth and in petrol stations such as Esso and Shell.
It is hoped the lottery will raise about Pounds 9bn by the year 2001 for
five 'good causes' - the arts, charities, a millennium fund, national
heritage and sport.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Tory chief strives to deflect row over contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jeremy Hanley, Conservative party chairman, yesterday committed the
government to 'the highest possible standards in public life' as senior
ministers sought to deflect allegations of impropriety in arms sales to the
Middle East.
Amid a welter of allegations about the involvement of Mr Mark Thatcher in
the Pounds 20bn Al Yamamah deal with Saudi Arabia, Mr Hanley said that no
evidence of any financial impropriety had been produced.
Seeking to distance the government from the administration led by Baroness
Thatcher, who negotiated the Al Yamamah deal in 1985, Mr Hanley said
ministers were not answerable for the activities of individuals such as Mr
Thatcher.
'The government is led by a prime minister who is highly honourable and
honest in his dealings, and the government has a record of which we are
proud,' he said on the eve of the party conference in Bournemouth.
'This conference is about the record of this government, and we what are
going to do over the next two-and-a-half years.'
Mr John Major, who will meet Lady Thatcher when she arrives in Bournemouth
today, is understood to be deeply angered by the reports, which divert
attention from efforts to steer the government away from Labour taunts about
'sleaze'.
However, ministers appeared unable to escape the jibes, which were given
fresh currency by a Daily Telegraph opinion poll suggesting that the
government is widely associated in the public mind with 'sleaze'.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said in Brussels that the findings were a
'sad comment' on the public perception of British politics.
'The fact is British politics is probably still the most honest in the
world,' he said on BBC Radio. 'It is a bit of a joke to claim that any
political party in Britain has standards that can really be described as
'sleaze'.
'I think in the knockabout of party political exchange some people use
language which is extremely unfortunate and some of the Labour spokesmen who
go completely over the top ought to reflect on the damage they are doing to
public confidence in politics.'
Labour MPs showed no signs of easing their campaign against alleged
'sleaze'. Mr Kim Howells, a Labour member of the Commons public accounts
committee, said it was 'extraordinary' that most committee members had been
prevented from seeing a report on the Al Yamamah deal. 'There were rumours
flying around left, right and centre . . .'

FT  11 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Step-by-step response to
IRA considered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government is considering a step-by-step response to the IRA
ceasefire in Northern Ireland amid acknowledgement among senior ministers
that it may never be given an unequivocal pledge that it is permanent.
The idea that the government should open a 'reversible' dialogue with Sinn
Fein, the IRA's political wing, will be considered by Mr John Major and
cabinet colleagues next week.
Ministers accept that in spite of worrying comments in recent days by senior
Sinn Fein officials and of evidence that the IRA is maintaining its military
capability, the signs are that the republicans intend the ceasefire to be
permanent.
A staged response - perhaps involving first the lifting of the exclusion
orders on prominent Sinn Fein members and the re-opening of indirect
contacts - would allow the government to be seen to be responding positively
while maintaining the option of withdrawing contacts.
Such an approach would allow the government to test further Sinn Fein's
commitment to a permanent peace by exploring whether the IRA was ready to
give up its arms and ammunition.
No decisions will be taken during this week's Conservative party conference
but ministers are expected to consider a detailed assessment of the
situation in the province on their return to Whitehall next week.
The government faces a potentially hostile response to its Northern Ireland
policy on Thursday when a number of party activists intend to press for the
full integration of the province into the UK.
But Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, hinted at the change of
tack yesterday. He said that the government was still not satisfied that the
IRA had halted violence permanently, before adding: 'If we are not satisfied
at the moment, we do not know for sure that we will ever be.'
Sir Patrick said in Belfast that there had been 'encouraging progress' but
the government was fully justified in its caution.
He rejected suggestions from Mr Peter Temple-Morris, the Conservative
backbench MP, that Mr Major would accept the permanence of the ceasefire
soon after this week's conference but did not rule out a more limited
response.

FT  11 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Rightwingers descend into
slough of despond - Fear of losing their seats will cause Eurosceptics to
keep quiet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This time around they will mainly avoid public confrontation. But Mr John
Major would do well not to misinterpret the relative calm of the Tory right
in Bournemouth this week.
It will not be the calm of the content. Still less of the vanquished. It
will be the calm of the despondent. And of a group that knows on which side
its bread is buttered.
Put bluntly, with the second half of the parliament now upon us rightwing
MPs, in common with the rest of the party, are starting to worry about
keeping their seats in the next general election.
With the Conservatives lagging woefully in the polls and a bright young
Labour leader threatening to make his party electable for the first time in
more than a decade, they have concluded reluctantly that the last thing the
party needs is a show of disunity. As Mr David Evans, a rightwing member of
the executive of the influential 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers, puts
it: 'The Tories like winning. They won't win if they are divided.'
Rightwingers seem as unhappy with the government's performance today as at
any time since April 1992 - although they were encouraged both by the
Eurosceptic rhetoric used by the prime minister in the European elections in
June and the promotion of two of their favourites, Mr Jonathan Aitken and Mr
Michael Portillo, in July's cabinet reshuffle.
But they fear that any immediate move to oust Mr Major could leave them
lumbered with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the incorrigibly Europhile chancellor. As
Mr Nicholas Budgen, the Eurosceptic MP for Wolverhampton South West, put it,
the right was likely to keep quiet in Bournemouth because: 'I don't think
there is any alternative.'
When they do speak out this week it will be to contribute to the debate
inside the party about how best to combat Mr Blair. They will advise against
any move to contest the centre ground that the Labour leader is attempting
to make his own. Instead, they will call on the leadership to nail its
colours to the mast in three key areas where they think it is vital to put
'clear blue water' between themselves and Labour.
The most important of these was spelt out by the Thatcherite Conservative
Way Forward in its probably vain eve-of-conference call for 2p off income
tax in next month's Budget. Even those who - like Mr John Townend, chairman
of the Tory backbench finance committee - think Mr Clarke is right not to
cut taxes until public borrowing has been reduced to acceptable levels,
still expect the chancellor to take the axe to public spending to clear a
path for tax cuts in November 1995. 'He has got to start cutting spending
this year if we are to get meaningful tax cuts before the election,' he
said.
Mr Townend also cautions against further increases in non-direct taxation.
'I think the government has underestimated the impact on the electorate of
tax increases by sleight of hand,' he said.
The right is also anxious for the government to retake the initiative on law
and order, an issue on which it thinks Labour has eroded the Conservatives'
traditional advantage, and on Europe, where it wants Mr Major to make it
clear that Britain would not join a single European currency.
With Maastricht done and dusted and the next intergovernmental conference
still more than a year away, the Tory schism over Europe looks set to be
less exposed in Bournemouth than at any Conservative conference since
Baroness Thatcher's fall. There is a potential flashpoint today in an
agriculture debate commending the government for its part in reforming the
Common Agricultural Policy. But the debate's timing, at the start of the
very first session, makes it likely that any trouble from Eurosceptics will
be on a small scale.
More worrying for the government is the right's attitude to the European own
resources bill, increasing Britain's payments to the European Union, which
is likely to come before MPs early in the next parliamentary session. Sir
Teddy Taylor is '100 per cent' certain to oppose it, notwithstanding the
feeling that the party needs to hang together at all costs. The MP for
Southend East believes the bill will be 'a massive embarrassment to
everyone' since it will increase public expenditure at a time of huge
pressure to bring spending down.
According to Sir Teddy: 'There is a depth of depression in the party I have
never seen before in 30 years. I think there is a feeling of deep gloom and
despondency. And a feeling I haven't seen since Ted Heath's time that we
hope something will turn up.'
If nothing does turn up and the party continues to trail Labour in the polls
by more than 20 points, then the main talking-point at next year's
conference in Blackpool may be the identity of Mr Major's successor.
Without some sign of tangible progress the right would by then have
concluded that if holding their tongues and avoiding public divisions was
not working, then they had better try something else. They would no longer
be prepared to 'hang on to nurse for fear of something worse'. As one
rightwinger said: 'If the Blair honeymoon doesn't end, it's better to try
anything rather than go off the precipice.'

FT  11 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Sceptical Saatchi warns on
slogans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mastermind behind the Conservative advertising campaigns since 1979 has
given the first public insight into the strategy behind the snappy electoral
slogans which helped ensure the party's four general election victories.
In a speech on the black arts of political propaganda Mr Maurice Saatchi
delivered a timely warning to the Tories that the slogans are useless unless
they are built on political substance.
Speaking at a dinner hosted by Mr Richard Ryder, the Conservative chief
whip, Mr Saatchi dismissed the idea that the creative skills of the
advertising industry's copywriters could provide a substitute for cogent
political argument.
Mr Saatchi, who has in the past avoided public comment on the thinking
behind such images as 'Labour isn't working' and 'Labour's tax bombshell',
said the campaigns had not worked by tricking the electorate.
The Conservatives had been successful because the party had recognised that
political campaigning was an adverse activity - a world of 'trial by combat'
in which, instead of behaving like an incumbent government, the party
behaved as if it was the opposition.
The slogans had worked because they encapsulated a basic truth. In a process
which ensured that 'only honest thought, as only honest merchandise, can
stand the limelight of organised publicity for any length of time',
advertising became reductio ad verite.'
But the ability to speak 'over the head' of the media directly to the voters
had dangers as well as advantages. If sufficiently wide and continuing,
advertising forced politicians to be exact or it annihilated them.
In what may be taken as a warning to the government to demonstrate a clearer
sense of purpose, Mr Saatchi said the political strategy behind the
advertising had to be as clear as the slogans: 'There's nothing fine about a
long-winded rambling argument that goes nowhere and never gets to the
point'. Instead: 'If you can't reduce your argument to a few crisp words of
phrases, there's something wrong with your argument'.

FT  11 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Lilley to offer benefit
inducement to jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, is expected tomorrow to unveil
an innovative reform of the benefit system to encourage more of the
long-term unemployed back into the labour market through part-time jobs.
In his address to the Conservative party conference in Bournemouth he will
propose a 'claim and save' system for unemployed people who take part-time
jobs but remain on benefit.
Any money now earned by an unemployed person above Pounds 5 a week is clawed
back from the benefit they receive. Under the 'claim and save' system the
money would still be clawed back, but it would go into a fund which would be
paid to the person when he or she took a full-time job and left the benefit
system.
The Lilley scheme is similar to one called Action Credit with which there
were experiments in the late 1980s. It was the brainchild of Mr Peter Ashby,
head of the lobby organisation Full Employment UK, but was introduced just
as unemployment started to rise and was not regarded as a success.
The 'claim and save' scheme acknowledges that many of the long-term
unemployed are working in the hidden economy, but it says that with the
right incentives they could be lured back into formal employment.
It is based on the assumption that a brief spell of employment, even
part-time employment, is the best way of making the long-term unemployed
more attractive to employers.
By providing a lump-sum payment on returning to work it also solves the
difficulty faced by many unemployed people in coping with the initial costs
of working before they have received a pay cheque.
Labour market experts in Whitehall have long been interested in using
part-time jobs as a stepping stone into full-time work, but there has been
strong resistance from the Treasury to tampering with the earnings
'disregards' which limit the amount it is possible to earn before claimants
lose benefit pound-for-pound.
Many of the 'claim and save' scheme's details have yet to be worked out,
including the period over which money can be accumulated in a fund and the
way in which that money will be treated by the tax and benefit system.
Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, who will also speak tomorrow, is
expected to spell out more of the detail of the Jobseekers' Allowance which
merges unemployment benefit and income support. There will be a white paper
on the JSA next month and it is expected to be implemented in 1996.
Mr Portillo will stress that receiving benefit depends on the recipient
signing a new agreement with the Employment Service and taking jobs which
are offered.

FT  11 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Party faithful scared of
the Blair factor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Standing in the taxi queue at Bournemouth railway station yesterday Mrs
Daisy Clement from Kent was looking grim.
'We have got to get our act together,' said the Tory party activist. 'Things
could not be worse than they are at the moment.'
As the Tory faithful assembled yesterday for their 111th conference the need
to improve the party's act was on the minds of many representatives.
The Tories are more than 20 points behind Labour in the opinion polls. The
economic recovery has still not brought a 'feelgood' factor in many parts of
the country. Above all, Mr Tony Blair's attempt to create a new Labour party
has raised a political challenge of a kind the Tories have not had for two
decades.
As Mr Peter Wormell, a delegate from Colchester put it: 'This is not the
Tory conference. It's 'Contain Tony Blair' week.'
Whatever worries they have the Tories at Bournemouth are not in a state of
panic. Last year there was incessant whispering at Blackpool about whether
Mr John Major would be challenged for the leadership. Yesterday praise for
the prime minister was modest but universal.
Some representatives also believe that Mr Blair's political ability has been
exaggerated by the media. Mrs Margaret Snowling from Newcastle said:
'Blair's performance does not bother me too much. He is a young leader and
has a great deal to prove. The media are too much in love with him.'
And the media's current pre-occupation with sleaze - in particular whether
Mr Mark Thatcher, the son of the former prime minister, received backhanders
from an arms deal in the 1980s - was not shared in Bournemouth's guest
houses yesterday.
Mrs Rita Hudson, a councillor from Humberside, said: 'There is sleaze in all
walks of life. If you have been in power as long as we have, there are bound
to be a few allegations like these.'
Where party activists were less certain was whether Mr Major should continue
to take the party on its current political course or move it further to the
right.
Mr Brian Delbridge from Yeovil said: 'John Major should stick to his own
agenda. The last thing we need is to move any further rightwards.'
Others were determined to give Mr Michael Portillo, the darling of the
right, a good reception when he delivers his speech as employment secretary.
'He alone embodies the determination we have as a party to cut back public
spending,' said one woman.
But one issue and one cabinet minister occupied everyone's mind yesterday.
After a wave of prison break-outs and bad crime figures, Mr Michael Howard's
performance as home secretary came in for severe criticism.
Mr Simon Kearney, a member of the Young Conservatives, said: 'Law and order
are absolutely vital to us. Michael Howard has got to pull his thumb out. We
can't let Tony Blair take the issue away from us.'
A delegate from the north-east was more forthright. 'I was much more
optimistic last year,' she said. 'I had great hopes when Michael Howard came
out with his detailed proposals on crime, but he is yet to get a grip.'
For her - and many others at Bournemouth - the home secretary's speech this
week will be the one thing that determines whether this party has really got
its act together.

FT  11 OCT 94 / 24 in court over London violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporter
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty-four people charged with offences arising out of Sunday's protest in
London against the criminal justice and public order bill appeared yesterday
at Highbury and Camberwell magistrates courts in London.
They were variously charged with violent disorder, affray, assaulting
police, possessing cannabis and threatening behaviour. They were remanded,
mainly on bail, for a few weeks.
Recriminations continued yesterday with police and protesters each blaming
the other for the disorder in Hyde Park and Oxford Street that led to
violent confrontations between an estimated 20,000 demonstrators and 2,000
police.
Mr Jeremy Hanley, Conservative party chairman, said yesterday that no party
had voted against the bill in the Commons. 'The vast majority of those who
demonstrated yesterday were demonstrating peacefully. It was a hard core of
very unpleasant people who decided they wanted to have violence and to break
shop windows. There is no place for them in our society.'

FT  11 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Irish Peace process may be
delayed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation proposed by the government of the
Irish Republic may be delayed until early next month, straining Dublin's
attempts to bring Sinn Fein into the peace process.
The republic is keen to use the cross-party forum to bring Sinn Fein, the
IRA's political wing, into the democratic process as soon as possible to
bolster moderates in the movement.
Underpinning Dublin's calculations is concern that republican hardliners
could abandon the peace process. Mr Mitchel McClaughlin, Sinn Fein's
northern chairman, told former republican prisoners in Londonderry at the
weekend that the conflict would be resumed if political negotiations broke
down.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Mucous membrane injury claims to be reviewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Campaigners pressing for compensation for sufferers of mucous membrane
disease caused by exposure to industrial irritants claimed a breakthrough
yesterday.
Welfare rights workers who launched a drive to alert sufferers to their
potential eligibility to compensation said new medical evidence on the
condition meant that cases previously rejected by the Department of Social
Security would be re-examined.
The campaigners, who have already helped win about Pounds 500,000
compensation from the DSS for people in the Wearside area, estimated that
the eventual total in their area alone could run into many millions of
pounds, with up to 10,000 cases being re-examined.
Awards so far include lump-sum payments ranging from Pounds 3,000 to Pounds
20,000. Successful claims may also result in weekly disablement pension
payments and reduced earnings allowances.
The Benefits Agency said it understood more medical evidence about the
disease had become available. Previously unsuccessful claims could be
reviewed on production of new evidence, but this did not necessarily mean
decisions would be reversed.
The campaign was launched by the Trades Union Congress Unemployed Centre in
Sunderland two years ago, in conjunction with Sunderland City Council's
social services department.
Industrial hygiene specialists from Newcastle upon Tyne University and ear,
nose and throat surgeons from Sunderland Royal Infirmary and Newcastle's
Freeman Hospital have been involved in collecting data on the disease.

FT  11 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Leaders accused of
stifling debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Charter Movement, a Conservative splinter group, has strongly attacked
the organisation of this year's conference in Bournemouth, accusing the
party leadership of making a determined effort to stifle debate.
Amid signs that Tory activists are divided over a large number of issues
this year - including privatisation of the Post Office and the possibility
of tax cuts - the movement said that the Tory leadership had shown
'feebleness' and 'failure' in the motions it had chosen for the conference.
The movement told delegates in a newsletter published yesterday: 'Do not
enter the conference hall burdened by commonsense. It is intended to be a
judgment-free zone.'
According to Charter the conference organisers have avoided debating a
number of issues this week which are of considerable interest to the
grassroots of the party.
'Forty-two constituencies have submitted a motion on identity cards,' the
movement says. 'But these have been completely ignored. It is clearly a
subject of intense interest, but this is no criterion when it comes to
deciding the conference agenda.'
Charter says that the subjects for this year's balloted motion - due to be
debated on Friday - have been carefully restricted. The movement says that
just 98 motions out of the 1,160 submitted by constituency associations will
be thrown into the ballot, and that these will be restricted to just six
subject headings.
It said yesterday: 'The Conservative party has become incapable of deciding
issues of debate. For so long, its conference organisers have striven to
eliminate the possibility of more than one point of view being expressed.'

FT  11 OCT 94 / Names may pay more damages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A larger proportion of the damages won in UK courts by lossmaking members of
Lloyd's of London might have to be funded from within the insurance market.
Munich Re and Swiss Re, two of the world's largest reinsurance companies,
yesterday released figures to counter suggestions that they would pick up a
substantial part of the damages bill.
The figures suggest that the sums the companies will pay out on professional
liability policies taken out by the Lloyd's agencies being sued will be far
less than hoped by many of the worst-hit Names.
Though few details about the underwriting and reinsurance of such
errors-and-omissions policies have been revealed, the figures indicate that
Names who have underwritten errors-and-omissions policies may have to fund a
larger proportion of the damages awards.
The figures also imply that Munich Re and Swiss Re would have only a minor
role - if any - in an attempt to strike a fresh out-of-court settlement
between Lloyd's, the members' agencies and the Names.
Last week the Gooda Walker Action group celebrated a High Court ruling it
said was worth Pounds 504m in damages for losses incurred by Names on Gooda
Walker syndicates as a result of catastrophes in the late 1980s and early
1990s.
The action group expected that a large share of the damages would be paid
out of errors-and-omissions policies - either by direct insurers or those
who reinsured such policies. But Munich Re yesterday estimated that the
maximum amount it may have to pay out was between DM10m (Pounds 4m) and
DM20m.
The group said this was because errors-and-omissions policies taken out by
Lloyd's underwriters had been only partly reinsured outside the London
market and that the cover it provided was only 'part of a part'.
The group added that it stopped signing such professional liability policies
'four or five' years ago - suggesting the amount it might have reinsured
during 1991, when Lloyd's made heavy losses, may well have been negligible.
Munich Re added that the maximum losses it expected to incur as a result of
other legal action by Lloyd's Names would be 'relatively low'.
Swiss Re estimated that it would have to pay out no more than SFr10m (Pounds
4.9m) on the errors-and-omissions policies of the Lloyd's agencies it
reinsured. Mr John Coomber, chief executive of the group's British
subsidiary Swiss Re (UK), described the group's exposure as 'relatively
modest'.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Financial market opinion influenced interest rate rise: Bank
was more concerned on inflation than Clarke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The attitude of financial markets played an important role in the decision
to raise base rates last month, according to the minutes of the September 7
meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the
governor of the Bank of England.
Base rates were increased from 5.25 per cent to 5.75 per cent five days
after the meeting. In the minutes, the chancellor noted that financial
markets were expecting interest rates to be raised sooner rather than later.
If those expectations were not realised, the markets could become more
volatile and the eventual rise in rates might need to be larger. An increase
in interest rates now would be an act of prudent economic management.
Mr Clarke added that moving then would keep the authorities in control,
rather than being driven by financial markets. The chancellor also
recognised that delaying would run a risk of an adverse market reaction.
Mr George, who proposed the increase in rates, also cited the financial
markets as an important factor. There were arguments for waiting a little
longer but the dangers - including the financial market dangers given
present international uncertainties - increased the greater the delay.
The governor warned the chancellor that if the decision were delayed, they
might need to return to the issue before the next monthly meeting. After a
two-day pause Mr Clarke agreed to the rise.
The minutes show that the governor was more enthusiastic about a rate rise
than the chancellor. Mr George based his case on data, such as
second-quarter gross domestic product growth, which showed that the economy
had been growing faster than previously appeared and above its trend rate.
The governor also pointed to concerns about inflation which, he said,
stemmed from business surveys and anecdotal evidence. He concluded that the
risks to the inflation objective further ahead had increased since the last
meeting.
Mr Clarke agreed that growth was strong but cited 11 separate reasons why
the inflationary indicators were not causing concern. The chancellor said
the UK was not on the verge of a take-off in inflation. Nevertheless he
added that the authorities had a duty to raise interest rates when necessary
to prevent inflation accelerating.
Although Labour was careful not to attack the decision to raise rates at the
time, sources close to Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday
criticised the decision-making process, and the emphasis placed on the
financial markets.
An aide said: 'Kenneth Clarke has become a chancellor who at best dithers
about important decisions and at worst lacks confidence in the government's
economic strategy.'

FT  11 OCT 94 / Equal opportunity policies attacked
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Equal opportunities policies which single out minority groups from the rest
of the workforce are doomed to fail, according to a study to be unveiled
later this month at the conference of Britain's main personnel organisation.
Ms Johanna Fullerton, who co-wrote the study for the Institute of Personnel
Development conference, told the magazine Personnel Today that policies
which appear to offer universal benefits for all are more successful.
Policies such as setting targets for the composition of the workforce and
positive action in recruitment advertising were the least successful,
according to the study of 285 companies. 'People seen to be given
preferential treatment doubt why they got the job, the promotion or the
training - and so do their colleagues,' said Ms Fullerton.
However, Ms Marie Cunningham, an equal opportunities adviser with British
Rail, told Personnel Today that the problem was with those implementing the
policies.

FT  11 OCT 94 / London's economy set for slow growth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London's economy is expected to grow 3 per cent in 1994 and 2.8 per cent in
1995, slower than the UK average, according to the London Chamber of
Commerce and Industry.
The chamber says the recession hit the London economy particularly hard
because of its exposure to the service sector but also because of a further
erosion of its manufacturing base.
London now has an unemployment rate higher than all other regions bar the
north of England and Northern Ireland.
The chamber says the housing market is a weak link, with London having the
worst negative equity position in the country.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Fall in business failures predicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business failures will fall by about 5 per cent in the third quarter of this
year compared with the second quarter according to Trade Indemnity, the
specialist trade credit insurer, Jim Kelly writes.
Compared with the same quarter last year the fall is predicted to be 33 per
cent. The figures are based on businesses linked to Trade Indemnity's
policyholders.
The fall in the second quarter of 1994 was 19 per cent from the first
quarter and 41 per cent from the same quarter last year. Total failures in
the second quarter were 829 compared with a predicted 785 in the third.
Mr William Simpson, chief economist with Trade Indemnity, said: 'The latest
decline in business failures supports other evidence of recuperating
corporate sector balance sheets.'
He noted, however, that house price deflation, and attempts to control
inflation in conjunction with tax increases, could combine to slow
consumption.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Changes to credit data leave City in two minds: CSO moves to
smooth data movements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The record consumer credit figures for August might have seemed dazzling -
but the reaction from many City economists was distinctly ambiguous. As
analysts debate the impact of the recent tax rises there is mounting
uncertainty about how far the recent credit surge points to any increase in
consumer confidence.
One reason is that the figures have proved highly volatile in recent months.
Net lending fell to Pounds 256m in May before soaring to Pounds 603m in June
then falling back to Pounds 349m in July. Levels of new lending have
fluctuated, often apparently at odds with official retail sales data.
The Central Statistical Office yesterday attempted to smooth out some of the
volatility in the new lending series by modifying its system of seasonal
adjustment. This takes account of the variation in the number of credit
processing days in a month, which can differ as a result of bank holidays
and other factors.
The move has been welcomed by groups such as the Credit Card Research Group,
an industry research body. Mr Peter Welch, head of research at the group,
yesterday said that if the CSO had not introduced the new system in August
the level of new credit-card lending would have apparently surged 11 per
cent, because August had 5 per cent more processing days than usual. Under
the new system of adjustment the figures showed credit-card lending up by
less than 1 per cent.
This move may have removed some of the statisticians' concerns, but has done
little to ease economists' broader uncertainty about what the series is
indicating.
In previous recoveries levels of lending have been regarded as a useful
barometer of consumer confidence and spending. Some economists still say
that the rise in credit this year is useful as a leading indicator of
confidence.
Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley, said: 'These figures show
us that the consumer is much less worried about borrowing - and much more
confident too - than the wider world would have us believe.'
Other economists believe that this analysis seems to be at odds with other
recent retail sales data and consumer confidence surveys.
Some observers suspect that the rise in credit-card borrowing could reflect
the fact that households have not been able to pay credit-card bills as
easily after the recent tax increases.
Similarly, the increase in finance house lending might indicate that
consumers are increasingly canny in retail purchases, choosing to buy white
goods through cheap finance loans.
Mr David Owen, UK economist at Kleinwort Benson said: 'You can argue it
either way - it can either be an indicator of consumer confidence, or quite
the reverse.'
Another, more significant, factor that may also be affecting the data is
that consumers' use of credit tools appears to be shifting. Mr Welch
believes that the recent increase in credit-card lending owes more to the
increasing popularity of cards as a payment tool rather than any pick-up in
confidence.
Ms Lesley Kay, of the Finance and Leasing Association, said that the recent
surge in finance house lending might reflect the fact that 'in store' credit
is becoming more popular than bank loans or other payment tools.
As another example of the way in which finance houses may be increasing
their market share, she pointed out that the level of car loans issued
through finance houses in August grew much more rapidly than the overall
level of new registrations - a trend which is likely to please the finance
houses, but do little to help statisticians make sense of the credit
numbers.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Daewoo to set up its own car 'supermarkets'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Daewoo, South Korea's second-biggest carmaker and the world's 33rd biggest
business group, is to sell its cars direct in the UK from its own
'supermarket' sites - complete with cafes and qualified nannies to look
after prospective buyers' children - starting in March.
Daewoo's Pounds 150m experiment to eliminate independent dealers, using a
network of 30 'Vision 2000' superstores backed by 100 wholly-owned or leased
service and used-car sales centres, is believed to be unprecedented.
It is not unusual for a manufacturer to own some of the outlets in its
dealership network. But most are independently-owned and the conventional
car distribution business is thus structured to achieving profits for both
parties.
Daewoo appears ready to mount a significant challenge to traditional car
retailing by stripping out a profits tier, using the scale economies of its
operating systems and taking advantage of its purchasing muscle.
Mr Leslie Woodcock, managing director of Daewoo Cars, the wholly-owned
subsidiary, refused yesterday to give any details of the pricing policy
Daewoo will pursue when its Nexia and Espero hatchback and saloon ranges go
on sale next March.
But Korea is an efficient car-making country with much lower costs than
Japan. Motor industry pay rates are about Dollars 8 (Pounds 5) an hour
compared with Japan's Dollars 32 and the Korean won has yet to rise sharply
against western currencies in the same manner as the yen.
The Retail Motor Industry Federation said yesterday: 'We shall watch what
Daewoo does about pricing with great interest. Will it mean, for example,
that they won't get into dealing - offering discounts on their list prices.
Will it mean that the sticker price on the windscreen is the end of the
story?'
Daewoo has set a target of selling 20,000 cars a year in the UK by 1997,
about 1 per cent of the new-car market. Mr Woodcock said the UK venture
would create nearly 2,000 jobs over three years.
The Nexia competes in the Ford Escort-sized sector and the Espero in the
medium-to-larger-sized sector.

FT  11 OCT 94 / DTI halts action on Arrow chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday dropped proceedings against
Mr Tony Berry, the former chairman and chief executive of the Blue Arrow
employment services group, which sought to have him disqualified as a
company director.
More than two years after the DTI applied to the High Court for the
disqualification - and only half an hour before Mr Berry was scheduled to
appear in court for a procedural hearing on the case - Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary, said the department would not continue with
its case.
The department said it was abandoning the case, initiated in September 1992
when investigators published the results of a probe into Mr Berry's
leadership of Blue Arrow, because legal counsel had advised Mr Heseltine
that a disqualification would be difficult to obtain.
The DTI said Mr Berry's evidence, the unwillingness of certain witnesses to
confirm their original reports to the inspectors, and the emergence of new
witnesses in support of Mr Berry led Mr Heseltine to his late decision.
After the decision Mr Berry criticised the time it had taken the DTI to
decide to throw out the proceedings. 'The government has been outrageous in
their treatment of me, to leave it right to the last minute,' he said. 'But
I do feel vindicated.' The DTI emphasised, however, that the findings of the
report 'still stand'.
The report said Mr Berry failed in his fiduciary duty to Blue Arrow and paid
insufficient regard to his statutory obligations as a director.
The investigation was launched in May 1989 after the details of an
investment approved by Mr Berry when he was chief executive came to light.
Mr Berry had already been stripped of his executive duties during a board
coup in January and had resigned as chairman the month before.
According to the report the circumstances of the Pounds 25m loan, to a
company controlled by Mr Peter de Savary, the entrepreneur, and involving a
property project on Canvey Island, Essex, were not disclosed to Blue Arrow's
board, shareholders or the Stock Exchange.
Mr Berry has always rejected the findings of the report.
He has maintained his directorship on the board of Tottenham Hotspur
Football and Athletic company, where he is deputy chairman.
He resigned as chairman of Business Technology Group in October last year
and is now chairman of Recruit, a private employment services company which
he bought in December last year.
When asked where he had found the funds to invest in Recruit, he said: 'I
begged and borrowed, but I did not steal.'

FT  11 OCT 94 / Jump in net lending to consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Net lending to consumers rose to record levels in August, after a small fall
in credit levels in the previous month, the Central Statistical Office said
yesterday, Gillian Tett writes.
Total lending to consumers through non-mortgage building society loans,
finance houses and credit cards covered by the Visa and Mastercard system
rose to Pounds 632m, from the previous month's Pounds 349m.
Measured on a three monthly basis - a figure regarded as a better guide to
the underlying trend - total consumer lending was Pounds 1.58bn in the three
months to August, up from Pounds 1.15bn in the previous three months.
The CSO said that the rise in the level of consumer credit reflected the
underlying upward trend in lending seen since the start of the year.
Higher net lending by finance houses, which provide finance for cars, store
cards and 'in-house' store credit, accounted for the biggest part of the
rise. Net lending by this sector rose to Pounds 486m in August, from Pounds
324m in July.
New lending by finance houses rose to Pounds 2bn in August, up from Pounds
1.91bn in the previous month. New lending in the three months to August was
2.3 per cent higher than in the previous three months.
Lending on credit cards also rose in the month, following a significant
repayment by consumers in July.
Net lending on credit cards rose to Pounds 125m in August, compared with
Pounds 18m in July. New lending on cards rose to Pounds 3bn in the month -
up 2 per cent on the previous three months.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Lloyd's damages bill doubted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of the world's largest reinsurance companies yesterday moved to counter
suggestions that they would pick up a substantial part of the bill for
damages won in UK courts by lossmaking members of Lloyd's of London.
Figures released by Munich Re and Swiss Re suggested that the sums they will
pay out on professional liability policies taken out by the Lloyd's agencies
being sued will be far less than hoped by many of the worst-hit Names.
Though few details about the underwriting and reinsurance of such 'errors
and omissions' policies have been revealed, the figures indicated that a
larger proportion of damages than previously thought might have to be funded
from within the London insurance market. As a result, Names may fund a
larger proportion of their own damages awards.
The figures also suggest that Munich Re and Swiss Re would play only a
relatively minor role - if any - in any attempt to strike a fresh
out-of-court settlement between Lloyd's, the members' agencies and the
Names.
Last week, the Gooda Walker Action group celebrated a High Court ruling it
said was worth Pounds 504m in damages for losses incurred by Names on Gooda
Walker syndicates as a result of catastrophes in the late 1980s and early
1990s.
The action group expected that a large share of the damages would be paid
out of errors-and-omissions policies - either by direct insurers or those
who reinsured such policies. But Munich Re yesterday estimated that the
maximum amount it may have to pay out was between DM10m (Pounds 4m) and
DM20m.
The group said this was because errors-and-omissions policies taken out by
Lloyd's underwriters had been only partly reinsured outside the London
market and that the cover it provided was only 'part of a part'.
The group added that it stopped signing such professional liability policies
'four or five' years ago - suggesting the amount it might have reinsured
during 1991, when Lloyd's made heavy losses, may well have been negligible.
Munich Re added that the maximum losses it expected to incur as a result of
other legal action by Lloyd's Names would be 'relatively low'.
Swiss Re estimated that it would have to pay out no more than SFr10m (Pounds
4.9m) on the errors-and-omissions policies of the Lloyd's agencies it
reinsured. Mr John Coomber, chief executive of the group's British
subsidiary Swiss Re (UK), described the group's exposure as 'relatively
modest'.

Safety regulations have been breached at Drigg, the repository for low-level
nuclear waste at Sellafield in Cumbria, according to Greenpeace.
The environmental group said a team entered the dump one night in July and
found evidence suggesting that it contained intermediate level waste. The
waste was uncovered, and contained jagged edges which could tear the
membrane which isolates it from the water supply.
British Nuclear Fuels, which operates the site, said it had been running the
site for 35 years to the complete satisfaction of the authorising bodies.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Commodity prices hit industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of materials used in manufacturing rose last month as the impact of
recent commodity price increases started to be felt. Overall, the input
price index rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.7 per cent in September, the
Central Statistical Office said yesterday.
Coffee, copper and pulp prices all rose sharply while the cost of crude oil
purchased by manufacturing fell slightly during the month.
The key reason for the coffee price rise was a world shortage which has been
aggravated by recent frosts in Brazil. The price of coffee imports has risen
by 5.3 per cent in the past month and has trebled in the past year.
The coffee price surge pushed the overall price of imported materials for
food manufacturers higher, the CSO said. Imported food manu-facturing
materials rose 2.4 per cent in September compared with August, adding 0.2
percentage points to the input price index.
This compares with a fall of 1 per cent in the month for home produced food
manufacturing products.
Rising copper prices on world commodity markets had a significant impact on
the metals sector, where input costs rose 2.4 per cent in September compared
with August, and 13.9 per cent in the year to September.
Copper prices rose 3 per cent in the month and are 30 per cent higher than a
year ago, the CSO said.
The rise in copper prices has been fuelled by stronger than expected
European economic growth and recovery in the construction industry, which
has boosted demand for the metal in the housebuilding and car industries.
Elsewhere in the index, the pulp, paper and publishing industry reported
price rises of 0.6 per cent in the month. These rises were largely passed on
to consumers, with output prices in this sector also growing by 0.6 per cent
in the month.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Virgin to launch cola drink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Virgin, Mr Richard Branson's airline and retailing group, is planning to
break into cola markets around the world with its own brand of soft drinks.
Virgin said last night: 'In partnership with a major north American group,
we will operate in a large number of markets through selected multiple
retailers.' A formal announcement is expected soon.
Cott, the controversial Canadian producer of own-label drinks and foods, is
thought to be the partner. It broke into the UK earlier this year by
producing the own-brand Classic Cola for J. Sainsbury.
Classic Cola embroiled Sainsbury and Cott in a fight with Coca-Cola over
packaging. Sainsbury changed its packaging after Coke protested it was too
similar to Coke's own distinctive style.
The Sainsbury's drink has taken varying shares of the market depending on
how heavily it was promoted at any one time. Sales of Coke, produced in the
UK by Coca-Cola and Cadbury Schweppes, have been hit to some extent. But
Pepsi-Cola has enjoyed a rising market share due to the success of its
Pepsi-Max.
Virgin Cola, plus caffeine-free and diet versions, are believed to be in
production at the Ben Shaw plant in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, of which
Cott owns 51 per cent. Some 1bn cans are due in the first year, using a
different formula from the Sainsbury drink.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Directors accused of illegal deals: Share support charges
denied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of European Leisure, the entertainment group, mounted an illegal
share support operation during the company's successful 1990 takeover bid
for Midsummer Leisure, it was alleged at Southwark Crown Court yesterday.
Mr Michael Ward, the former European Leisure chairman and chief executive,
and other former directors used their own money to fund third parties buying
shares in the company to maintain or increase its share price during the
bid, Mr Anthony Donne QC, prosecuting, said.
Mr Donne was opening the prosecution of Mr Ward, Mr Jeremy Howarth, a former
EL finance director, Mr John Doyle, a Jersey taxi-driver, Mr Walter
Crawford, a Glasgow ship-repairer, and Miss Angela Pollard, a former EL
public relations manager.
Mr Ward denies charges of conspiracy to defraud, conspiring to create a
false market and theft. The others deny various similar charges. Mr Crawford
is charged only with theft and false accounting.
Mr Donne told the jury that the share support operation was started after
EL's share price dropped in a general slump in the leisure sector after
which Midsummer withdrew its approval of the bid. Mr Donne said that during
the takeover period, in April and May 1990, four separate share support
operations were carried out to purchase stock worth almost Pounds 500,000.
These involved:
Using an intermediary company and later covertly reimbursing losses suffered
on the sale of the shares through paying a false invoice.
Paying cash to Mr Doyle to buy shares.
Using a Guernsey account in the name of Rebecca Tye, Mr Ward's former
housekeeper and sister-in-law of Angela Pollard, to buy more shares.
Using Mr Crawford to buy shares paid for through a false invoice for work on
a ship.
The false ship repair invoice was questioned by other EL executives
including Mr David Brownstone, the commercial director, and discussed at a
meeting with EL's lawyers. Before the meeting the EL company secretary, Mr
Tony Freeman, gave Mr Brownstone other documents about the share support
operation.
Although the lawyers accepted Mr Ward's denial of any impropriety, Mr
Freeman and Mr Brownstone both resigned. Mr Donne said that before Mr
Freeman resigned he was subjected to a tirade of abuse from Mr Ward.
The trial continues today.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Channel 4 seeks legal guidance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Channel 4 is seeking legal guidance on whether a parish council can take the
company to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission over allegations that a
programme unfairly and unjustly branded a local community as harbouring
dangerous racists.
The company was yesterday given leave to seek a High Court ruling that the
commission has no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint from
Elmton-with-Creswell parish council in Derbyshire.
Mr Justice Auld said he had some doubts about the application but 'just
about on balance' there was an arguable case.
Mr Jonathan Caplan QC, for Channel 4, said any programme involving
allegations of disreputable behaviour in a particular area would give rise
to 'a whole host of potentially admissible complaints' if the commission
were allowed to hear the case.
The action stems from a programme in The Brief legal series broadcast in
March concerning a private member's bill on racism and racial violence being
debated in the Commons. As part of its report the programme looked at an
ethnic minority family.
The parish council said the programme 'gave the impression that there is a
serious racial problem within the community', which it denied.

ScotRail, which operates most passenger trains in Scotland, yesterday
launched a series of marketing initiatives aimed at replacing revenue lost
because of the signalworkers' dispute, James Buxton writes.
Mr Chris Green, the former managing director of InterCity who became
managing director of ScotRail in April, said the company's revenue from
fares was down by Pounds 8m.
It also lost passengers because of disruption in the Haymarket area of
Edinburgh owing to a major signalling fault.
To win back lost passengers ScotRail has cancelled its usual autumn fares
increase. It has a two-for-one offer until the end of November under which
applicants obtain a free voucher for a second person if they pay for one
ticket for travel anywhere in Scotland.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Eurotunnel in 'strong start'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel said yesterday that its shuttle freight service had made a strong
start in its first two months of operations, but ferry companies denied that
it had made any inroads into their cross-Channel business.
Mr Christian Zbylut, Eurotunnel freight director, said shuttle freight
trains had carried up to 350 trucks a day, equivalent to 12 per cent of the
Dover-Calais market, and were well placed to achieve the target of 22 per
cent of the cross-Channel freight market by the end of next year.
Eurotunnel is offering 34 departures a day in each direction. This will rise
to 50 departures in early December.
The freight shuttle was used by 450 customers on a regular basis last month.
Among big customers of the service are Securicor Omega Express
International, which has replaced airborne deliveries with tunnel services.
Eurotunnel said it was not challenging the ferries on fares and its prices
were 5 per cent to 10 per cent higher than the ferries because it offered
the advantage of speed and reliability. Tariffs are negotiated individually
with hauliers. A typical price per truck to regular users was about Pounds
200 compared with Pounds 390 for a one-off journey.
The ferry companies retorted that their freight shipments were increasing
and there was no sign of Eurotunnel taking away any of their business. Stena
Sealink said there had been 'absolutely no impact' on its Dover-Calais and
Dover-Dunkirk traffic. Hauliers attracted by Eurotunnel's initial discounts
had return-ed to the ferries, it said.

FT  11 OCT 94 / TV staff face jobs ultimatum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employees of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television face a deadline of 4pm today to
accept new terms and conditions imposed by their employer or face dismissal.
The company said the new cost-saving terms were necessary to ensure that it
remained competitive in bidding to make programmes for the national ITV
network.
The unions, which say YTTV is trying to coerce its employees, are taking
legal advice in an attempt to ensure that the company honours its
contractual obligations to its staff.
The company said last night that it was acting lawfully and added: 'If we
fail to convince them, dismissal would be the result.'
YTTV's 800 employees, spread through Yorkshire, Humberside and north-east
England, already work on an annualised hours system.
The new deal would mean than any overtime hours worked in addition to those
hours would be paid at a flat rate, not at a premium rate - mostly one and a
third or one and a half times normal pay, as at present.
Mr Colin Bourne, the northern region organiser for the National Union of
Journalists, said this change would mean some employees' earnings would drop
by up to 40 per cent.
Flat-rate overtime pay for flexible hours is becoming common in ITV with a
number of companies paying premiums only for late rostering or very
concentrated rostering.
In addition new ITV companies such as Meridian have individual contracts
rather than collective bargaining.
At least one senior ITV executive suggested yesterday that YTTV was trying
to catch up in terms of the competitiveness of its work practices.
YTTV moved to impose the new terms this week after three months'
negotiations with the unions failed to produce agreement.

<TEXT>
Citizens' advice bureau services across England are under 'serious threat'
because of a central funding crisis at a time when record numbers of people
seek help with social security benefit and debt problems, the national
organisation for the bureaux said yesterday.
A four-year funding freeze imposed on the National Association of Citizens'
Advice Bureaux seems likely to disrupt core services to local bureaux across
England.
Staff fear that the national information system, on which the bureaux rely
for advice, will be hit. That would lead to patchy services when they are
most needed.
They blame officials at the Department of Trade and Industry, which has
imposed the cash standstill on the national association, which relies on the
government for 80 per cent of its funding.
Workers said the service would receive Pounds 12m for 1993-94 and the figure
would remain at that level for four years.
Ms Helena Shovelton, who chairs the association, said: 'The CAB service is
facing a serious threat. A funding standstill in reality means serious
cutbacks in services, and this is something we cannot just sit back and
accept.'
She vowed to fight for more money and added: 'It is neither reasonable nor
realistic for the government to expect the CAB service to deal with an
ever-increasing workload - much of it resulting directly from the
government's own legislative programme - without proper recognition of our
own resource needs.'
Introduction of incapacity benefit and the job-seeker's allowance, and plans
to tighten homeless legislation, were all likely to increase the workload,
she added.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Ex-soldiers seek probe into tests
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Former soldiers yesterday launched a campaign for an independent medical
inquiry into chemical weapon tests on human subjects in military
laboratories.
Thousands of servicemen have been tested with chemical agents such as nerve
gas and mustard gas at the Chemical Weapons Establishment at Porton Down,
Wiltshire, according to the newly formed Porton Down Volunteers'
Association.
It says increasing numbers of the men are complaining that the experiments
have damaged their health. The former soldiers are demanding compensation
and urging the government to admit that the tests were harmful.
The Ministry of Defence insists that there is no evidence that the health of
any servicemen has deteriorated as a result of participation in the
experiments.
But the association stresses that Porton Down has not carried out regular
medical checks on the men. Association spokesman Mr Mike Roche said: 'How
can they claim that no one had become ill when they have not even checked
properly?
'We believe an independent scientist should investigate the health of any
serviceman who believes his health has been harmed. The government should
then accept the findings.'

FT  11 OCT 94 / Sugar daddies of the technology colleges / A look at how a
government initiative gets its funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Children at St Aidan's high school in Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire, will
soon have a new network of 50 computers for lessons ranging from drama to
geography, thanks to a government initiative to attract sponsorship of
educational technology.
St Aidan's is among 50 so-called technology colleges, the latest of which
were announced yesterday by the Department for Education. All have been set
up since February as a result of an unusual partnership between government
ministers and Sir Cyril Taylor, a radical educationalist who is chairman of
the City Technology Colleges Trust.
While Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, caught the headlines
with the announcement of eight more colleges, all of them existing secondary
schools, Sir Cyril has been responsible for much of the less visible
activity.
Sir Cyril, a former Procter &amp; Gamble advertising manager, served in the
1950s with the King's African Rifles in Kenya against the Mau Mau
guerrillas. Nowadays he is battling to promote science and technology
teaching through greater involvement by business.
In recent months he has organised and paid for a series of dinners at
London's solidly Conservative Carlton Club to tell small groups of business
leaders about the aims behind technology colleges.
Mrs Shephard was to have attended the latest one, held last month, but fell
ill and her place was taken by Mr Robin Squire, the schools minister.
Previous dinners have been attended by Mr John Patten, the former education
secretary who lost his job in the summer ministerial reshuffle.
The guests on these occasions have included Mr Steve Grigg, education and
strategic liaison director at British Aerospace, a strong supporter of
closer links between industry and schools. BAe is putting Pounds 150,000
into two technology colleges - one of them St Aidan's - while backing
relatively small scale projects at a further 40 or so schools.
Mr Grigg said: 'The dinners are not about cadging people to become sponsors
but are a way to promote discussion about bringing companies closer to
education to help UK Ltd.'
Less enthusiastic about technology colleges is Mr Dominic Cadbury, chairman
of food and drink maker Cadbury Schweppes and who was at last month's
dinner. Mr Cadbury said his company 'had chosen a different route' for
spending money on schools, by concentrating on projects involving a range of
schools mainly in the Birmingham area.
Sir Cyril is described by a friend as 'a brilliant educational entrepreneur
 -someone who likes to get things done'. In the early 1960s he set up the
American Institute for Foreign Study, a private company which arranges
student transfers to and from the US. He started the CTC Trust, a charity,
in 1987. Since then he has been informal adviser to a series of Conservative
education secretaries. He is on friendly terms with Mr John Major, the prime
minister, with whom he and other leading business people had dinner earlier
this year.
When the trust first started its brief was to help promote city technology
colleges, a series of 15 purpose-built new schools funded by private
sponsors with large amounts of cash, typically Pounds 1m per school. In the
past year the trust has redirected its energies towards attracting sponsors
for the more modest series of technology colleges. The trust has a grant of
Pounds 300,000 a year from the education department.
Sir Cyril said the trust had had 'a very high success rate' in targeting
companies which later became sponsors of colleges. The colleges were an
'extremely cost efficient investment'. Asked about the dinners, Sir Cyril
did not want to disclose his guests but last month's gathering included
representatives from US computer companies Intel and Oracle, New York
investment bankers Salomon Brothers, North West Water and Rolls-Royce.
The 50 technology colleges set up so far have all arranged at least Pounds
100,000 of private funding from a total of more than 120 companies,
charities or private donors. In each case the school has had an equivalent
amount of cash from the education department.
The money goes on capital projects such as new laboratories and computers,
while the government also provides a small yearly grant for extra revenue
costs. Corporate backers have included ICL, Midland Bank, Tate &amp; Lyle,
National Westminster Bank, Apricot Computers and Thames Water.
Not all the companies Sir Cyril has talked to have proved receptive. One
criticism - voiced by Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman of food maker
Northern Foods and who was at last month's Carlton Club dinner - is that the
government is seeking extra funds from corporate sponsors to help reduce the
load of schools funding on the taxpayer.
More bullish is Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of electrical goods retailer
Dixons, and another dinner guest in recent months. Mr Kalms's company put
Pounds 2m into a City Technology College in Bradford, Yorkshire and more
recently he contributed Pounds 100,000 of his own money to two technology
colleges in northern England.

FT  11 OCT 94 / ScotRail tries to win back travellers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ScotRail, which operates most passenger trains in Scotland, yesterday
launched a series of marketing initiatives aimed at replacing revenue lost
because of the signalworkers' dispute.
Mr Chris Green, former managing director of InterCity who became managing
director of ScotRail in April, said the company's revenue from fares was
down by Pounds 8m because of the 18 days of strikes in the past three
months.
It also lost passengers because of disruption in the Haymarket area of
Edinburgh owing to a major signalling fault that took Railtrack three months
to repair. The fault caused punctuality on services from Edinburgh to
Glasgow and Fife to plummet but they have now recovered.
To win back lost passengers ScotRail has not had its usual autumn fares
increase. It is promoting a two-for-one offer running until the end of
November under which applicants obtain a free voucher for a second person if
they pay for one ticket for travel anywhere in Scotland.
ScotRail has launched an executive ticket to promote first class
accommodation on services linking Aberdeen with Edinburgh and Glasgow. The
return ticket costs Pounds 49 instead of Pounds 96.
Eight other promotions are planned to boost train travel in the winter
months.
Mr Green said the promotions would cost Pounds 250,000 but should bring
extra passengers on trains which were running anyway and incurring fixed
costs.
He said ScotRail was 'more or less on schedule' with its preparations for
the selling of its franchise by the government, which should take place late
next year.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Drug success claimed in fight to slow MS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Multiple sclerosis victims may be able to obtain, by 1996, a drug that
drastically slows the progress of the disease.
The results of clinical trials, presented yesterday in San Francisco, showed
with 98 per cent certainty that the progress of the disease's symptoms in
patients taking beta interferon was about half the speed in those taking a
placebo.
If approved by regulatory authorities, the drug should bring its developer,
the Massachusetts biotechnology company Biogen, more than a third of a world
market estimated at Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 880m) by 1998.
MS is the most common disease of the nervous system in young adults. It
affects worldwide some 2m people who suffer a slow disintegration of
physical co-ordination.
The results of large-scale clinical trials were announced yesterday at the
American Neurological Association meeting in San Francisco.
As well as the slowing of the disease's progress, the proportion of patients
reporting 'flare-ups' in the debilitating disease was cut by half over 18
months.
These results seem better than with the one drug now on the market,
Betaseron from the German company Schering.
However, clinical trial results are not directly comparable because of
differences in condition of patients in the trials and in effectiveness
measures.
Even so, Mr Lawrence Jacobs, head of neurology at Buffalo General Hospital
in New York, who conducted the trials, was confident that Betaseron would
not have been as effective as beta interferon if the two had been compared
in idential trials
Analysts at Lehman Brothers, the US stockbroker, forecast that sales of
Biogen's drug will have overtaken those of Schering by 1998. However, there
could be two or three other drugs on the market by then.
Switzerland's Ares Serono is producing a beta interferon similar to
Biogen's, while Israel's Teva has a drug which works by a different
mechanism.
Such competition could reduce the price of the drug per patient from about
Dollars 9,000 a year at present, says Lehman Brothers.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Chaos puts aid effort at risk: Ted Bardacke on rebuilding
the Haitian nation without a government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government in Haiti has all but ceased to exist. So, when millions of
dollars in foreign aid follow the planned return this week of exiled
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, getting it to those who need it most will
be no easy task.
And, when business groups prepare for the restoration of a normal economy,
knowing whom to negotiate with and trust will also be difficult. The
military government the US came to remove is no longer functioning. Except
for levies on consumption, no taxes and tariffs are being collected; bills
from the state-owned electricity company are unpaid.
The national government has an annual budget of just Dollars 125m (Pounds
79m), 35 per cent of which went to the armed forces. In the three years of
military rule, there has been virtually no spending on education or public
works.
'The Haitian budget has a very low impact on the country's economy,' says Mr
Raymond Lafontant, head of the Haitian Industrial Development Association.
'If they closed all the ministries, the country would still work.'
A senior official at the ministry of economy and budget says he has had no
contact with the Aristide team that will take over the management of the
economy. Upon President Aristide's return, he says, he will 'not
necessarily' have a job.
Between Dollars 450m and Dollars 770m in aid is due to be disbursed over the
next several years. While the government - a government - is set up again to
administer it, several solutions are being offered to keep aid money under
US control so that it gets to the people who need it in this country with an
annual per capita GDP of Dollars 250.
The United States Agency for International Development, which will control
many of the new assistance programmes, wants much of the money to go through
local government officials. To do this they must wrest the control of local
administration from the dreaded so-called Section Chiefs, rural strong men
appointed by the military regime. So USAID will immediately look to fund the
December local elections, where it is hoped that the Section Chiefs will be
swept into oblivion.
'Those elections are the insurance policy for our aid,' says one USAID
official.
The US occupation force is also doing its part. One of the mandates of
Special Forces troops operating in rural areas is to determine development
priorities for the new government, and in the capital army doctors are
designing a plan to convert an abandoned hotel into a hospital.
'The government has no absorption capacity,' says Mr Dieter Hannusch of the
United Nations Development Programme. 'The best situation would be for the
government to oversee the projects without having government employees do
the actual work.'
Many of the humanitarian assistance programmes would be contracted out to
Haitian non-governmental organisations (NGOs), while infrastructure works
would fall to the private sector.
Haitian NGOs were given much responsibility under the Aristide government
but were accused of being partial to Aristide supporters. Since the coup,
USAID has been working with leaders of those NGOs, many of whom had gone
underground, identifying those considered 'trustworthy and independent'.
Haitian business groups, while happy to win contracts from international aid
groups and to have the UN economic embargo lifted, say that the Aristide
government must focus its energies on political stability.
'We can work with anybody as long as they ensure peace and stability,' says
one prominent local businessman, while Mr Lafontant estimates that with
political stability half the country's 45 export-oriented assembly plants
will be functioning within six months.
'Aristide understands that an infusion of capital directly depends on the
level of stability in the country,' a senior US official said during a visit
to Haiti last week.
The embargo has created an unprecedented level of pent-up domestic
investment capital. 'People who made a lot of money off the black market are
eager to invest in concrete projects,' says Mr Robert Stryhanyn who owns
concerns in cement and transportation.
At the country's only iron and steel foundry, owner Mr Gilbert Bigio is
constructing new sales offices to handle the expected growth in business.
Yet many businessmen complain that the market is too free and that to
sustain economic growth beyond what the initial aid and euphoria will bring,
the government must start to do something about the high hidden costs
associated with the breakdown of economic order.
For instance, moving goods through the capital's port costs three times as
much as it does in the neighbouring Dominican Republic because of
corruption, even though most cargo comes in tax free. Private security
services, which make up for a lack of police protection, are a big cost.

<TEXT>
Lt-Gen Raoul Cedras, head of the military government in Haiti, resigned his
post yesterday and announced he was leaving the country, thus facilitating
the return of the man he overthrew in a bloody 1991 coup, President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Mr Aristide's supporters immediately took to the streets of the capital,
Port-au-Prince, to celebrate, forcing the US military to protect Gen Cedras
and his family, as well as Gen Jean-Claude Duperval, who was appointed
interim head of the Haitian military yesterday.
At a public ceremony on the steps of military headquarters, Gen Cedras
attempted to leave power in a dignified manner, handing over nominal control
of the armed forces and police to Gen Duperval, his second-in-command, as a
40-piece military band played the battle anthem of Haiti's armed forces.
But thousands of Aristide supporters turned the ceremony into a mockery,
singing anti-military songs to the band's tune. Chants of 'Aristide is
coming back, Cedras is going to eat sewage', and the noise of US military
helicopters overhead, drowned out much of the departing general's speech.
Gen Hugh Shelton, commander of the 17,000 US personnel on the ground in
Haiti, oversaw the ceremony, escorting Gen Cedras to the podium while US
troops kept screaming supporters of President Aristide at bay.
'I choose to leave the country because my presence could be a pretext for
unjustifiable acts,' Gen Cedras said.
There was no immediate announcement of which country would give him refuge,
but Ms Madeleine Albright, US ambassador at the UN, said last night the
general would move to an 'undisclosed South American country'. A US diplomat
ruled out Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Paraguay.
US officials also said they believed Gen Duperval would relinquish power to
President Aristide's nominee to head the military when the president made
his expected return on Saturday. Five Haitian colonels met the president
last week in Washington to discuss civilian control of the military.
The resignation followed two days of meetings with US officials, including
Mr William Perry, defence secretary, and Gen Shelton, in which Gen Cedras's
safety after he had stepped down and ways to deal improve the maintenance of
law and order in the country were discussed.
The general's authority over the military, and the military's reign of
terror over the population, had been steadily declining over the past week
as it became apparent that he had no future as commander.
Pro-Aristide demonstrations throughout the country have become widespread,
often with deadly consequences for the president's supporters.
On Friday in the town of St Marc, about 75km north of the capital, at least
10 people died and scores were injured as a bus ploughed into a pro-Aristide
rally. At the weekend, a similar incident occurred near Miragone, south of
the capital, killing 12.
Over the next few days, US forces will be under pressure to protect both
pro-Aristide rallies, sure to increase as the population prepares for the
return of its president, and members of the Haitian military, which is in
disarray but under unusual orders not to fire on Haitians.
Gen Cedras took power on September 30 1991, when his two leading associates
 -Brig-Gen Philippe Biamby and the police chief Lt-Col Michel Francois -
took President Aristide from his home and sent him into exile, first in
Venezuela and then in Washington.

<TEXT>
US anti-trust enforcement agencies are expected to be able to expand their
reach overseas when President Bill Clinton signs a bill, passed in the
closing hours of the congressional session on Saturday, to allow greater
co-operation with foreign competition authorities.
The bill will allow the US Department of Justice and Federal Trade
Commission, which share responsibility for enforcing anti-trust laws, to
provide information which they would otherwise be barred from divulging to
countries which agree in return to share their own information.
The US has this sort of legal co-operation agreement only with Canada.
Justice Department officials credit the co-operation pact with helping them
to break up a cartel to fix the prices of thermal fax paper and plastic
cutlery earlier this year.
Ms Janet Reno said the new law would 'give us unprecedented access to
evidence needed to conduct investigations of international business
activity'.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Kuwaiti army puts on an unconvincing display: Troops look
self-conscious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   IRAQ-KUWAIT BORDER
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Kuwaiti army put on an unconvincing display of its military preparedness
to scores of journalists taken to within 10km of Kuwait's northern border
with Iraq yesterday.
On a windless day with temperatures well into the 90s, there was little
movement of any kind in the featureless desert from the Jahrah Ridge (site
of the decimation of the retreating Iraqi army on the second-last day of
Desert Storm in March 1991) up to the demilitarised zone (DMZ).
Journalists were bussed 80km up the highway running north from Jahrah, 20kms
west of Kuwait City, to two forward command posts, the nearest 5km from the
DMZ. The zone runs the full length of the 207km Kuwait-Iraq border,
extending 5km into Kuwait and 10km into Iraq.
Some 20-30 of Kuwait's arsenal of 150-200 aged M-84 tanks could be seen
spread out and occasionally dug in either side of the north-south highway
from the Jahrah Ridge towards the border town of Abdali. One oil-field fire
was burning and gas was being flared in the area of the Sabriya oilfield,
part of the much larger Raudhatain Reservoir south of the border.
Whole areas of desert were scarred by rusted metal and other waste typical
of military activity and oil camps. At one spot beside the main road, Kuwait
army spokesmen took special pride in pointing out what they said were the
remnants of an Iraqi soldier's uniform, barely visible above the sand and
long since shredded by sun and wind.
Journalists were invited to photograph soldiers posing behind machine-guns
mounted on pick-up trucks or atop an M-84, a re-designated version of the
Soviet T-72 modified by the former Yugoslav army.
Major General Ali al-Mumin, Kuwait's army chief-of-staff, said his men had
experienced war on August 2, 1990 and in the subsequent liberation of
Kuwait, and were in a state of 'highest alert'. Appearances can be
deceptive. Still, those few troops visible looked more self-conscious, or in
the case of the tank-crew, remarkably cool despite the heat and their
cramped space, than alert or battle-hardened.
But Gen al-Mumin maintained a brave face. He suggested the Iraqis facing him
across the DMZ comprised three Republican Guard divisions numbering
50,000-60,000 men, an estimate some 20,000 less than the figure given on
Sunday night by Sheikh Saud Nasser al-Sabah, Kuwait's information minister.
Facing them are 20,000 Kuwaitis.
Asked to justify his confidence in view of the Iraqi numerical superiority,
Gen al-Mumin referred to the support given by 'our brothers-in-arms and our
friends', a clear reference to US forces which he said would be arriving
'sooner than you think'. Many arrived in Kuwait on Sunday night.
Brigadier General Salem al-Surour, army commander in the Abdali sector, said
Kuwait's army would stay on full alert whatever the outcome of the debate in
the UN Security Council.
A more spontaneous reaction to Kuwait's military preparedness was given by
an off-duty conscript who bluntly commented that were it not for the US
forces, many Kuwaitis would have left for Saudi Arabia. Several journalists
who had been with coalition forces during Desert Storm were equally negative
in their comments on the army's seeming military unpreparedness.
As though in recognition of this, the numbers of US reinforcements due to
arrive in Kuwait have increased to some 18,000 marines plus thousands of
extra ground troops from the Rapid Deployment Force attached to the US
Central Command. These extra troops are in addition to the several thousand
already in Kuwait.
The military confrontation with Iraq has been blurred by the arrival of
several thousand 'stateless' Bidoon who have pitched some 6,000 tents on
Iraq's side of the border in the port city of Umm Qasr. Described by Kuwait
as 'Iraqi soldiers in civilian clothes', it is expected they will be
encouraged by Iraq to hold 'demonstrations' to draw attention to their
'plight', to embarrass the Kuwaiti government.

<TEXT>
President Saddam Hussein's aggressive troop deployment in southern Iraq has
'changed the environment' within the United Nations Security Council and
suffocated previous support from France and Russia for early moves towards
an easing of sanctions, diplomats in New York said yesterday.
The diplomats described the deployment as a 'foolish' and 'failed' attempt
to bully the Security Council which, they said, would only postpone any
consideration of easing the economically crippling four-year-old oil
embargo. 'The Council cannot accept to be threatened,' said one official.
'This has been very counter-productive for the Iraqis.'
Security Council members are today due to receive a report from Mr Rolf
Ekeus, UN special envoy, on the readiness of monitoring systems to ensure
Iraqi compliance with a post Gulf war ban on developing weapons of mass
destruction. The report is expected to say the systems are in place and that
a test period can begin.
Last week Iraqi officials issued an ultimatum, apparently backed up by the
past few days' show of military muscle near the Kuwaiti border, threatening
unspecified 'measures' should the Security Council not act immediately on Mr
Ekeus's report and move towards easing sanctions.
However, diplomats said that while the Security Council is likely to
consider the report at a meeting tomorrow or Thursday, it is not expected to
issue more than an acknowledgment that the weapons monitoring systems are
'provisionally operational'. As a western official said: 'I don't know what
Saddam is waiting for, but he's not going to get anything out of the
Security Council.'
France and Russia, along with China, had previously said they backed
offering Iraq a definite six-month monitoring test period which, if Iraq
complied, they said should lead to a full Security Council discussion on
easing sanctions. Britain and the US opposed giving Iraq such concrete
criteria for the lifting of sanctions.
Yesterday, however, diplomats said the Iraqi troop movements had reversed
these diplomatic gains. 'All the environment has changed,' said one. 'And we
cannot expect the council to take any positive action on the Ekeus report.'

FT  11 OCT 94 / Strong US support for Clinton over Gulf stand
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton may have found it hard to win support for his policy
in Haiti, but he has no shortage of backers for his actions in response to
the build-up of Iraqi troops near the Kuwaiti border.
Republicans who were closely involved in the US's first confrontation with
Iraq in 1990-91 were quick to back both Mr Clinton's decision to reinforce
the US military presence in the Gulf and his firm statements of the US's
determination to thwart any repeat of Iraq's 1990 invasion.
'I thought President Clinton did it right today: let's not get excited, but
let's, on the other hand, remember that Saddam Hussein is totally
unpredictable,' said Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state
during the Gulf war and later secretary of state.
Mr Dick Cheney, the Bush administration's defence secretary, added his
support for the reinforcements sent to the Gulf and for Mr Clinton's strong
statements.
But he went further in suggesting that the US should be ready to attack
pre-emptively.
'I think we ought to take the initiative at the appropriate point, when
we're ready. He ought to be told either to stand down his force or we'll hit
him, and it ought to be at our timetable, not his,' Mr Cheney said in a
television interview yesterday.
Mr William Perry, his successor at the Pentagon, refused yesterday to rule
out the possibility of a pre-emptive strike.
Republicans have been quick to warn Mr Clinton not to allow himself to get
trapped into negotiations with Baghdad.
'There's no mission here for Jimmy Carter,' quipped Mr Cheney.
Mr Carter's recent missions to North Korea and Haiti have both been
successful in winning some kind of agreement that averted the threat of war,
but the former president has been strongly criticised for backing the
administration into making too many concessions.
The only strong criticism of Mr Clinton's actions came from Mr Ross Perot,
the Texan billionaire who lost to Mr Clinton in the 1992 presidential
election.
In a tirade more rambling than his norm, Mr Perot accused the president of
orchestrating the tension with Iraq, as well as the US-led occupation of
Haiti, to try to improve his party's chances in next month's congressional
election.
'What's about to happen? We're about to have an election, right? This is the
old game. The first war didn't get him a bump in the polls, now let's try a
second one,' Mr Perot said.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Iraq still to abide by UN resolutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Iraq is the subject of a long series of UN Security Council resolutions,
starting with Resolutions 660 and 661, which condemned the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait in 1990 and imposed economic sanctions.
Sanctions are to remain in place until Baghdad complies with the terms of
subsequent resolutions, notably 686 and 687, passed immediately after the
1991 end of the Gulf war.
Those terms include: the elimination of ballistic missiles and weapons of
mass destruction (WMD); respect for Kuwait's borders and sovereignty;
co-operation with the International Red Cross on the release of Kuwaitis and
others it detained during the war, the location of missing persons; and
insistence it accept its liability for the losses and damage it caused in
Kuwait.
In a report to the US Congress in June, President Bill Clinton reported that
the US believed the International Atomic Energy Agency had 'effectively
disbanded the Iraqi nuclear weapons programme, at least for the short term'.
Missile launchers and 'a good deal of Iraq's indigenous capability to
manufacture prohibited missiles' have been destroyed, and UN missions have
reduced Iraq's ability to produce chemical weapons.
But, US officials say, 'serious gaps remain in accounting for Iraq's missile
and weapons of mass destruction programmes'. They regard the setting-up of a
long-term monitoring programme as especially important, 'because we believe
Saddam Hussein is committed to rebuilding his WMD capability'.
Also, the US says, Iraq has continued to breach Resolution 688, which
demands it stop persecuting its Kurdish inhabitants and other populations
such as the Marsh Arabs. Baghdad continues to drain the marshes and burn the
reeds in southern Iraq and to raze or shell villages.
Iraq still refuses to recognise Kuwait's sovereignty and the inviolability
of the UN-demarcated border between Iraq and Kuwait, which the Security
Council reaffirmed in Resolutions 773 and 833. Nor has it co-operated, US
officials say, with the International Red Cross on Kuwaiti detainees, or
given information about 600 people listed as missing.

A 62-year-old Frenchman who had lived in Algeria for 20 years has become the
19th and latest French victim of the civil strife which has claimed the
lives of 63 foreigners and an estimated 28,000 Algerians over the past 21
months.
Mr Roger Merle, a consultant engineer, was killed at the weekend in the
industrial zone of Oued Smar, 10km east of Algiers on the road to the
airport. His death comes two days after Algerian security forces found
another Frenchman, Mr Roger Maniere, with his throat cut. He had been
kidnapped six days before in Meftah, south-east of the capital.
The killings prompted Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, to renew his
call for all French citizens whose presence is not indispensable to leave
Algeria. About 1,000 French citizens still live in Algeria.
The radical Islamic Armed Group (GIA) have claimed responsibility for
killing most of the foreigners murdered so far. The latest killings come
three weeks after the Islamic Salvation Front leaders were moved from prison
to house arrest, prompting speculation a dialogue between Gen Liamine
Zeroual, head of state, and more mainstream fundamentalists might be
starting.
Violence is rising in Algeria, with an estimated 400 people killed in the
last week of September. Observers note the increasingly sophisticated
methods used by the Islamic groups, notably bombs detonated by remote
control.

<TEXT>
Peacemaking efforts in Israel by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of
state, were overshadowed yesterday by a wave of outrage over the killings of
two Jerusalemites in a late Sunday night shooting spree by Palestinian
gunmen.
Mr Christopher, who held talks with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and flies
to Damascus today to meet Syria's President Hafez al-Assad in his attempt to
broker a breakthrough in Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations, joined Mr Rabin
in condemning the shooting as a crude effort by extremists to derail the
peace process.
While many Palestinian leaders have condemned the incident, Mr Yassir
Arafat, PLO chairman, had refrained from issuing any statement as of
yesterday evening, and Mr Christopher urged him to add his voice to the
chorus of condemnation.
Spokesmen for the Hamas Islamic fundamentalist movement in Gaza claimed
responsibility for the attack in which a 19-year-old Israeli woman soldier
and an Arab from a village on the outskirts of East Jerusalem were killed.
They said the action had been timed to coincide with the anniversary of the
October 8, 1990 killings of 18 Palestinians by Israeli security forces on
the Temple Mount.
The two gunmen, both of whom came from Gaza, opened fire with semi-automatic
weapons as they ran down a paved side street packed with bars and
restaurants in the heart of west Jerusalem at about 11.30pm Police said the
pair fired about 200 bullets, and threw two hand-grenades that failed to
explode, before they were shot dead by Israeli security forces.
Other opposition leaders noted bitterly that one of the gunmen, Hussein
Abbas, had been released early from a jail term for Hamas membership under
the provisions of the Israel-PLO autonomy deal. There were also reports last
night that the other gunman, Issam Johari, was a member of the Palestinian
police force that has taken over responsibility from the Israeli army for
law and order in Gaza.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Ivory Coast aspires to be an 'African elephant': Devaluation
has helped set the west African country on the road to recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ivory Coast's prime minister Daniel Kablan Duncan recently compared the west
African country's good growth prospects to those of south-east Asia. 'People
talk a lot about the dragons of south east Asia,' he said. 'But I want Ivory
Coast to become an African elephant.'
His comments come after Ivory Coast's international competitiveness was
restored in January by a 50 per cent devaluation of the CFA franc (the
13-nation west and central African common currency) against the French franc
and follow a sharp rise in commodity prices.
Confidence is high that after nearly a decade of economic decline, recovery
may not be far off. The government expects gross domestic product to
increase by 2 per cent in 1994 and nearly 6 per cent in 1995 and 1996, and
most economists agree. But it will be some time before the improvement is
reflected in the standard of living.
The most direct beneficiaries of devaluation are exporters, mainly farmers.
Cocoa producers, for example, have seen the prices paid to them by the state
increase by 20 per cent since the devaluation. Another increase was due this
month.
Meanwhile urban Ivorians have been hit by the higher cost of imports, a
problem only partly alleviated by the new government safety nets. Social
unrest, however, has not been a problem.
Fears that the recovery would be thrown off course by the death of the
country's long serving President Felix Houphouet-Boigny in December 1993
have also proved unfounded. If anything, the smooth succession by Henri
Konan Bedie has shown the durability of the system created by 'Le Vieux' in
his 33 years at the helm.
While the government has been quick to welcome the emergence of green
shoots, recovery remains fragile. With public spending being increased, a
balanced budget is dependent on cocoa and coffee prices holding firm and
excessive public-sector wage demands being resisted.
So far inflation has been kept under control. Although first half prices
were up 20 per cent, compared with just 4.4 per cent a year ago, the
increase is still well within the 35 per cent maximum set by the
International Monetary Fund in a structural adjustment agreement signed in
January under which Abidjan was promised soft loans totalling SDR333m
(Dollars 486m) over three years. In February the World Bank approved
structural adjustment loans of nearly Dollars 1bn, also over three years.
Whether Ivory Coast achieves a sustained recovery will depend partly on
factors outside its control and on its success in tackling deep-rooted
structural problems. In the former category, much depends on economic
recovery in Europe and Africa - in 1992 more than half its exports went to
Europe and a third to Africa. At home, recovery will be constrained by at
least two structural problems - debt and the lack of economic
diversification.
One of the government's top priorities is to reduce the high level of
internal debt and, in particular, to clear internal arrears which have
stifled economic activity in recent years. It has already rescheduled and
consolidated the bulk of the debts to the banking system, public enterprises
and the private sector. But internal Ivorian arrears were still about 8 per
cent of GDP at the end of 1993.
Ivorian banks meanwhile are less worried about bad debts than too much
liquidity. Since devaluation, high interest rates have attracted a massive
influx of capital from abroad and frightened off borrowers. As terms of
trade have improved, exporters have begun to pay off their overdrafts and
importers, having anticipated the devaluation, have built up stocks and cut
orders, reducing their need to borrow.
In the longer term, the biggest threat to recovery comes from the external
debt burden, which grew by nearly 10 per cent last year.
According to World Bank and IMF estimates, at the end of 1993 total external
debt, 77 per cent of which is public sector, was about Dollars 19.4bn, more
than twice GDP, and total external arrears were about Dollars 5.3bn, more
than four times the previous year's figure.
One effect of the devaluation has been to double the CFA franc cost of the
debt. But, what is more important, it has also encouraged international
creditors to release loans worth about Dollars 1.1bn to the country this
year, including the 1994 instalments of the IMF and World Bank loans.
While international aid may relieve the symptoms of external debt, a cure
will require a widening of the economic base. Efforts to diversify have been
largely unsuccessful - cocoa and coffee still account for more than half the
foreign exchange - although the recent discovery of offshore oil and gas by
US oil company United Meridian offers some cause for hope.
Privatisation is also moving slowly, but this may soon change. Under
pressure from the IMF, parliament passed a law in June outlining a detailed
timetable for the privatisation of some 50 state enterprises by mid-1996. By
the end of August, 10 companies had been privatised, including the
electricity distribution company CIE which was sold to the French large
engineering company Bouygues in 1991. The French company is also said to be
interested in the telecommunications company CI-Telcom, due to be sold in
1995.
With presidential and legislative elections due at the end of next year,
economic reform is likely to remain slow. While President Bedie and the
ruling PDCI party are certain to win the elections, only the second to be
open to other parties, maintaining budgetary rigour will be more difficult.
But failure to reduce economic dependence on cocoa and coffee might mean
that the country misses its best chance in nearly a decade to revive its
battered economy.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Beijing angered by party in HK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's uneasy relations with China took another lurch for the worse
yesterday when Beijing rebuked London for allowing Taiwan's representatives
in Hong Kong to celebrate their 'national day'.
China was stung by the decision by Hong Kong's urban council to allow the
colony's cultural centre to be used by Taiwan to mark 'Double Ten' - the day
the republic of China was founded in 1911. China celebrated 45 years of the
People's Republic on October 1.
The foreign ministry in Beijing attacked the Hong Kong government for
allowing the celebrations to proceed. It said this proved once again 'that
the British side's deeds do not conform with its words,' according to state
radio and television reports monitored in the Chinese capital.
The reports quoted ministry spokesman Mr Chen Jian as saying Britain 'lacked
sincerity to improve Sino-British relations'. The decision 'not only hurts
the feelings of the Chinese people but also adds new difficulties to
Sino-British relations,' he said.
'We demand the British side really fulfil its promise (of recognising only
one China) or else the British side should be held responsible for whatever
serious consequences arise from this,' Mr Chen added.
The urban council's decision to allow the Taiwanese to use a public building
has deeply embarrassed the Hong Kong government. Less then a week ago,
Governor Chris Patten offered closer co-operation with China in the run-up
to the 1997 handover of the colony.
In public, however, the government has stood by the decision, claiming that
to reverse it would be illegal.
The latest Anglo-Chinese row has come at a time when the British Foreign
Office was making a renewed attempt to repair relations with Beijing. A
meeting between the two countries' foreign ministers a fortnight ago had
gone well.
Some officials said the 'Double Ten' controversy had spilled over to other
areas of the relationship. During the weekend, Mr Lu Ping, China's top
official in charge of Hong Kong affairs, demanded Hong Kong re-tender a
contract for a big port project.
Beijing objects to one of the participants, the Jardine Matheson group, in
the successful consortium. Earlier it had called on Hong Kong to exclude
Jardine from the group, saying the company was a beneficiary of British
favouritism.
Mr Anson Chan, Hong Kong's chief secretary, rebuffed this suggestion. 'To
suggest that our decisions were taken on anything other than economic or
financial grounds undermines business confidence and impugns the integrity
and competence of the government and the officials involved in the
exercise,' she said.
Mr Lu has also urged Hong Kong to hand over sensitive financial data on its
budgets in the interests of smoothing the transition in 1997. These demands
were rejected.

FT  11 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Efta chief faces short contract - A Nordic
yes to the EU would spell the association's end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I cannot exclude the possibility that Efta may end next year,' admitted the
incoming secretary-general of the European Free Trade Association, Mr
Kjartan Johannsson, on August 31, his first day at work. His last may not be
long in coming if Finland, Sweden and Norway follow Austria in voting this
autumn to join the European Union.
In that case, only a miracle will prevent the Icelandic diplomat and former
trade minister, together with his 270 staff in Geneva and Brussels, being
out of a job next July.
With the loss of four of its seven members Efta will be reduced next January
to a rump of one small nation and two tiddlers - Switzerland (population
7m), Iceland (population 260,000) and Liechtenstein (population 28,000). The
association's chances of surviving this amputation look slim at best.
Iceland has already made plain it too may apply for EU membership if its
Nordic partners vote yes.
Ironically, Efta, which was established in 1960 to promote free trade in
western Europe, has never been busier. The watershed came in 1989 when Mr
Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, proposed establishment
of what was to become the European Economic Area, a single market of some
370m people linking the EU with six of the seven Efta nations.
To satisfy the terms of the EEA accord, which came into force at the
beginning of this year, Efta had to set up an Efta court and a surveillance
body to oversee implementation of the new trading rules. The association's
staff doubled in size. Yet, after just 12 months, those institutions will no
longer be needed.
Switzerland is not a member of the EEA following the narrow rejection by
voters in December 1992. Iceland has decided to open discussions with the EU
on preserving the EEA accord as a bilateral deal between Reyjavik and
Brussels.
Liechtenstein will vote for a second time on EEA membership later this year
because of consequent changes in its trading relationship with Switzerland
with which it has a customs union. But even if the answer is another yes the
principality will be forced along the bilateral route in Iceland's wake.
This means there will be no residual role for Efta in supervising its
members' compliance with EEA rules. And the association's other main area of
concern, trade agreements with third countries, also looks likely to
disappear.
As of now, Efta has negotiated free trade accords with half a dozen nations
in central and eastern Europe, Turkey and Israel. However, in law and in
practice these are bilateral agreements applied by Efta's individual
members; the association has never aspired to become a customs union with a
common external trade policy.
From next year the EU entrants will be bound by trade accords negotiated in
Brussels. Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein will continue to apply the
agreements with third countries and the free trade agreements they have
between themselves. But it scarcely seems likely they will want to stump up
for a common secretariat to keep an eye on their activities.
As late as last year there were hopes that Efta would find a new role as a
'half-way house' for countries of central and eastern Europe aiming at
eventual EU membership and thinking of the EEA as a possible stepping stone.
Such hopes have been comprehensively disappointed. As Mr Johannsson frankly
concedes, these countries have shown no interest in Efta, preferring to aim
straight at goal, 'and if the political desire is not there it is not on the
agenda'. Hungary and Poland have already filed their applications with
Brussels in a bid to join the EU around the turn of the century.
It seems that the only thing that will save Efta now is a no vote in one or
more of the Nordic nations. Finland, the most likely to say yes, votes on
October 16, Sweden on November 13 and Norway, where opposition is greatest,
on November 28.
In mid-December all seven Efta trade ministers will meet in Geneva to decide
what to do next. But already they have given notice that adjustment to the
new situation, whatever that may be, will be completed in the first half of
next year. Mr Johannsson's present contract, and those of his staff, expire
at the end of June 1995.

FT  11 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Romania close to helicopter pact with
Chile
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Romania is close to signing a long-term support contract to maintain
military helicopters for the Chilean armed forces, the first deal of its
kind between the two countries.
Under the contract, which is due to be signed within two months,
Turbomecanica and IAR, two Romanian helicopter manufacturers, will repair
the Chilean army's Puma SA 330 helicopters at sites in Romania and Chile.
Turbomecanica will repair engines, motorheads and gear boxes in Romania and
produce all the new components needed. It will sub-contract to IAR
maintenance work on the helicopters' airframes in Chile, according to
Turbomecanica officials.
The value of the contract has not been disclosed but it is believed to run
to several million dollars.
The deal is part of a strategy by the two companies to expand their repair
and maintenance activities, officials said. The companies, have manufactured
the Puma SA 330 military helicopter under licence from Aerospatiale of
France since 1975, producing 150 of the 600 helicopters of this type
worldwide.
Turbomecanica, which employs 400 engineers, also produces engines for
civilian and military engines under licence from Rolls Royce of the UK and
turbines for gas-pumping stations.
Romania is the only country in the former Eastern bloc with an aerospace
industry based on western rather than Soviet technology.
Since the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, the country, which has the capacity
to manufacture two Puma helicopters a month, has re-oriented sales to
western countries.
This year it completed a Dollars 37m contract with the United Arab Emirates
for 10 Pumas, and also exports the helicopter to France, Ecuador and
Pakistan.

FT  11 OCT 94 / World Trade News: South Africa and EU agree on closer ties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PRETORIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union and South Africa yesterday signed a co-operation
agreement, laying the foundation for closer political and economic ties and
marking the conclusion of a four-day visit to South Africa by Sir Leon
Brittan, the external economic relations commissioner.
The agreement, which was signed in a ceremony at Pretoria by Sir Leon and Mr
Thabo Mbeki, South African deputy president, is primarily concerned with
boosting co-operation in trade and development, although it also deals with
questions of human rights and democracy.
It will also allow the European Investment Bank, which currently has Ecu300m
(Pounds 236m) earmarked for South Africa, to begin lending activities in the
country as well as setting the legal basis for the expansion of EU-South
African economic links.
Both the agreement and Sir Leon's visit testify to the growing prominence of
the EU in South Africa as an institution separate from its member states.
More importantly, they lay the groundwork for the negotiation of a formal
trade agreement between the EU and South Africa. The EU is currently South
Africa's biggest trading partner and receives more than 40 per cent of South
African exports, while providing 33 per cent of the country's total imports.
Two-way annual trade amounts to R63bn (Pounds 11.5bn).
Although South Africa was admitted to the Generalised System of Preferences
in September, there is currently a debate over whether the country should
also seek accession to the Lome Agreement, which provides 69 developing
countries with preferential access to EU markets, or whether it should
instead draw up a separate agreement with the EU.
Speaking at the signing, Mr Mbeki said he hoped that the resolution of this
question could be reached as 'quickly as possible' but warned that any final
deal would first require consultation with other states in the region.
Sir Leon echoed these sentiments and said that he hoped that the EU also
hoped to contribute to broader regional development.
However, he warned that urgent action first needed to be taken by South
Africa to dismantle its existing trade barriers if it wished to become an
attractive market for European investment. 'Such a protectionist system (as
South Africa's) makes no sense today,' he said. 'I have stressed that
further liberalisation is essential for both trade and investment.'
Earlier on his trip, Sir Leon announced plans to form a joint EU/South
Africa Business Council to help promote business ties and trade links.
Meanwhile, on the aid front, the EU has long been South Africa's largest
single donor of unattached grant assistance for development, having spent
R1.2bn since 1986. It plans to spend a further R440m a year on various
development programmes, especially in education and health.

FT  11 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Malaysia dampens hopes of Apec deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's international trade and industry minister,
yesterday said there was little prospect that the Asia-Pacific Economic
Co-operation summit in Indonesia next month would reach a binding free trade
pact, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur.
Responding to a statement from Mr Bob McMullan, Australian trade minister,
who said on Sunday there was a better than 50-50 chance of an agreement, Mrs
Rafidah said: 'I don't know that. Many countries do not subscribe to an Apec
free trade agreement, not just Malaysia.'
Mr McMullan said that despite differences on the pace of change within the
17-member Apec forum, leaders at the November 15 meeting would agree on a
free trade initiat ive.
'My view is that the odds are better than 50-50 that we will get some
agreement,' he said on television after attending an Apec trade ministers'
meeting in Indonesia last week.
Mrs Rafidah said even if an agreement was hammered out it would just be an
'academic exercise'.
'As I understand it, Apec operates on the basis of consensus,' she said.
'That means no country can be bound by anything that Apec decides. So this
(trade agreement) would be just an academic exercise.'
She said Malaysia preferred to realise free trade goals through the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
'We have, in fact, ratified Gatt, but many other countries in Apec,
including the US, especially the US, have not,' Mrs Rafidah said.
'How can you you talk about free trade in Apec when you can't fulfil your
obligations under Gatt?' She reiterated Malaysia's position that Apec should
be a consultative forum focusing on trade facilitation, technology transfer
and human resource management.
Mr McMullan said that if the leaders agreed to a goal of 2020 for free trade
in the Asia-Pacific region, as suggested by Apec's eminent persons group, it
would be an historic achievement.
However, the actual date was not important.
'I think that once the process starts it is almost certain that it will
accelerate,' Mr McMullan said.
The eminent persons group has suggested a timeframe which staggers
dismantling trade barriers between 2000 and 2020 depending on whether a
country's economy is developed, industrialising or developing.
Australia, the US, Singapore and Indonesia favour fast-tracking trade
liberalisation in the region, while Japan, along with Malaysia, have
expressed some reservations at the pace of change and the formal development
of Apec.
Apec groups Australia, the US, Canada, Mexico, Japan, China, Hong Kong,
Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines, Malaysia,
Singapore, Thailand, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand.

Philips, the Dutch electronics group, and IBM, the US computer group, are
negotiating the establishment of a semi-conductor joint venture at IBM's
existing German factory in Boblingen Hulb, near Stuttgart.
The proposed venture will make memory chips for IBM and logic chips for
Philips. The move, which hinges on successful completion of the negotiations
as well as on government approval, would help solve some capacity problems
at Philips, which earlier this year announced an expansion of its main Dutch
semi-conductor plant in Nijmegen. IBM's plant currently employs 800 people
to manufacture 4 megabit dynamic random access memory (D-RAM) chips. The
venture would rely on assets and employees from the existing Boblingen Hulb
site.

China is poised to become the world's fastest growing consumer market, with
spending set to treble over the next 10 years, according to a report
released yesterday by DRI/McGraw Hill.
The report entitled 'China's Consumer Markets: Here Comes the Boom', said:
'Within the next 10 years, total consumer spending will triple, from Dollars
261bn in 1993 to Dollars 734bn by 2003.' Consumer spending is expected to
grow at an average annual rate of 7.5 per cent, making China the world's
fastest growing consumer market for that decade. 'By the year 2003, China
will be among the world's largest markets for televisions, refrigerators and
other appliances and electronic products,' the report said. Status and
entertainment goods, such as CDs, cosmetics, blue jeans and air conditioners
should do particularly well. More than Dollars 4bn will be spent on
children's clothing, and more than Dollars 2bn on household furniture over
the decade, while retail sales of beer are expected to total more than
Dollars 8bn, the report said.

FT  11 OCT 94 / World Trade News: U-turn by US hits Caribbean exporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD ORLEBAR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GUATEMALA CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Garment and textile exporters in Central America and the Caribbean will be
seriously affected by a US government U-turn on trade benefits.
Central American and Caribbean nations, which thought they had secured the
administration's backing for market access, were shocked by the recent
decision to remove the so-called Interim Trade Programme. The ITP would have
granted Caribbean and Central American states parity with Mexico in
exporting to the US and Canada and thereby protected their markets.
US vice-president Al Gore announced in in May that the ITP would be attached
to fast-track legislation on Gatt, following months of lobbying by regional
exporters who share about 14 per cent of the US market.
However, the administration was forced to uncouple the preferential access
from a legislative package on ratifying the Uruguay round of Gatt in an
effort to speed ratification of the world trade treaty. .
Central American officials feel the decision flies in the face of rhetoric
on Pan-American solidarity in the run up to the Hemispheric summit to be
held in Miami in December.
'It's like a bucket of cold water,' said Jose Orive, Guatemala trade
negotiator with North America. Mr Orive said suppliers were already
beginning to relocate to Mexico. Officials fear new buyers and investors
will be increasingly difficult to attract.
The clothing industry has grown rapidly in Central America in recent years,
providing several hundred thousand people with jobs generally better paid
than the farm sector.
In Guatemala and Honduras the sometimes appalling labour conditions, the
suppression of union activity, physical violence against workers, and
summary dismissals, have angered US unions and human right groups who have
campaigned in favour of the removal of trade benefits.
According to data from the US Department of Commerce, 1993 clothing imports
from Guatemala were worth Dollars 551m, from Costa Rica Dollars 653m,
Honduras Dollars 509m, and El Salvador Dollars 251m.
Without North American Free Trade Agreement parity, textile and apparel
exports pay between 17 per cent and 21 per cent tariffs, which makes them
uncompetitive with Mexico in an industry where profit margins are tight,
says Mr Eduardo Gonzalez, Guatemala's economy minister.
Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico has agreed a
three-year tariff reduction which begun this year and which will reach zero
by 1997.
The administration's decision is at odds with US clothing companies who
source in Central America to take advantage of the low labour costs and
comparative proximity to the US market, which allows for a rapid response to
orders in comparison with far eastern suppliers.
The decision on ITP is a further blow following the exclusion of garments
and textiles from the Caribbean Basin Initiative earlier this year. The 24
countries which are beneficiaries of the 10-year old Initiative are allowed
to ship some products duty free to the US. However, garments and textiles
were excluded after pressure from the US industry.
Mr Gonzalez says there has already been a sharp drop in growth in garment
exports from CBI countries. In 1993 Mexico's exports grew 19 per cent
compared to 28 per cent for CBI countries. In the first quarter of 1994
Mexican garment exports rose 39.2 per cent, and CBI exports were up by only
9.9 per cent.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Russia softens stance on CSCE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH and CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia yesterday appeared prepared to back down on its proposal to transform
the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe into the continent's
most powerful security structure.
Speaking at the opening of a two-month CSCE review conference in Budapest,
Mr Yuri Ouchakov, the head of the Russian delegation, said the CSCE should
be the 'major moving force in European security' but that there was no need
to set up a 'hierarchical system'.
Since May, Russian officials have proposed that CSCE become Europe's top
security organisation, subsuming Nato and the Commonwealth of Independent
States. The strengthened organisation would be headed by a United
Nations-style 10-nation steering committee and would mandate Nato or CIS
forces to intervene in regional conflicts.
The idea to strengthen the CSCE, which includes European and CIS countries,
the US and Canada, followed Russian concerns that its influence in Europe
was being undermined by Nato. The proposal has been rejected by the west.
Russia's back-pedalling on the CSCE comes at a time when Moscow has achieved
a quiet, though possibly temporary, victory in the creation of a post-cold
war world order. Although the west has made it clear that Russia will not be
admitted to Nato in the forseeable future, Russian objections have also put
a brake on the rapid entry to Nato of eastern European states.
Mr Sam Brown, the US delegate, said Mr Ouchakov's statement showed
flexibility on the part of the Russians and recognition that its proposals
were not possible at present. He said the US would welcome the strengthening
of the CSCE but it should remain one of a number of security structures.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Policy fears push rouble to new low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The rouble fell a further 6 per cent against the dollar yesterday, crashing
through the 3,000 barrier on fears of rising inflation and deteriorating
government finances.
The government reacted calmly to the fall to 3,081 from Friday's close of
2,896, and traders said there was no intervention by the central bank.
Markets are awaiting the outcome of ministerial negotiations on the Russian
budget, expected to be presented to parliament during the present session.
Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, said there were still
sufficient reserves to control the currency's fluctuations, even though the
bank had spent Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in the past few months to support
the rouble.
But a bank spokesman yesterday blamed the rouble's fall, which has been
accelerating over the year, on speculative trading, and said reserves would
not be wasted on fruitless intervention. 'We do not want to help market
speculators,' he said.
Russia's acting finance minister, Mr Sergei Dubinin, attempting to calm
markets, said the drop was not justified by economic conditions. 'There will
be no sharp rise in inflation because objectively all money supply
indicators rule this out. There will soon be equilibrium, the market will
stabilise, inflation and the dollar rate will move in parallel,' he said.
The turmoil in the currency market will make it more difficult and expensive
for the government to raise money in the Russian Treasury bill market, which
will be much on the government's mind as it finalises the 1995 budget.
Over the weekend, ministers flew to the holiday home of Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, at the Black Sea resort of Sochi to try to
settle the outstanding issues. The details of the budget will be critical
for the confidence of the currency market when they are presented to the
parliament next week.
Currency traders said the inaction of the bank and the lack of a government
policy statement were exacerbating the situation. 'We expect the devaluation
to continue - possibly to 3,300 to the dollar this week - unless some
drastic measures are taken by the government,' one trader said.
The rouble's fall is damaging the government's domestic economic credibility
as the queues lengthen outside currency exchange points and the rising price
of imported goods hurts Russian consumers. The relative stability of the
currency throughout the summer had led to a marked increase in savings and a
growing belief in a more stable economy.
Trading on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, with only thin liquidity,
has proved highly volatile, with even small trades having a big impact on
the rouble's value. But the rouble's fall has been on an accelerating trend.
In July it had fallen 3.1 per cent against the dollar; in August, 4.5 per
cent; in September, 17.8 per cent; and in the first few days of October 16.5
per cent. Since the start of the year the rouble has fallen from 1,247 to
3,081 against the dollar.
Some correction to the rouble exchange rate was perhaps inevitable this
autumn, given the recent rise in the inflation rate.
The lower rouble may provide temporary relief to Russian industry and should
particularly help the energy sector, which has been badly hit by the
accumulation of inter-enterprise debts. The hard currency earnings of oil
and gas companies will now be worth considerably more when translated back
into roubles, helping to ease the sector's cash flow problems.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Austria given rude awakening: The rise of the far-right
Freedom party will enliven political life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Austria faces a more robust, unpredictable political life following Sunday's
national election result than it has known in the post-war period.
For the first time since 1945, the Social Democratic party (SPO) and
conservative Austrian People's party (OVP) together won less than 80 per
cent of the vote. With slightly less than two-thirds of the seats in the new
parliament, they can and will continue to govern, but no longer in the
complacent, self-serving way they have in recent years.
There is inevitably a frisson of fear in the fact that the biggest winner
from the ruling parties' losses is the extreme right-wing leader, Mr Jorg
Haider, whose Freedom party now has almost as much support as the OVP. But
Austrian commentators of many persuasions yesterday agreed that the result
was good for democracy.
Many suspected also that it reflected not just a transitory disenchantment
among voters with the traditional parties, but rather an irreversible
generational change in voter behaviour.
Older Austrians, who learned their politics during the post-war occupation
period, have felt obliged to stick to the traditional parties through thick
and thin. In the early days, when virtually every economic activity was
state controlled, it was only through the parties that people got jobs and
vital services, and they have understandably remained loyal.
But a younger generation of voters that grew up during the prosperous 1960s
and 1970s does not understand, let alone feel, this 'laager' mentality. The
side by side existence of socialist and conservative health clubs and motor
clubs and of compulsory employee and employer representative institutions is
alien to them.
The careful balancing of socialist and conservative sympathisers in the
boards of nationalised industries and banks seems bizarre, not to say
inefficient.
'We have finally succeeded in putting post-war Austria behind us,' Mr Haider
exulted on Sunday night, and no one argued with him. Mr Haider, a lawyer and
a former provincial governor of Carinthia, was the first politician to see
and exploit the opportunity presented by this change.
Since taking control of the Freedom party in the mid-1980s, he has hammered
relentlessly at every instance of outrageous patronage perpetrated by the
socialists and conservatives and exposed cases of politicised bureaucrats
receiving excessive salaries. A rebel by nature, he has also in an
opportunist way championed every popular grievance, especially the swelling
of immigration since the collapse of the Soviet empire.
Mr Haider's popularity has risen fairly steadily, but opponents assumed that
it would reach a limit at around 20 per cent. At times, it has looked as if
they were right, especially when he suffered embarrassments.
He has never quite lived down his outburst in a heated debate in the
Carinthian legislature in June 1991 when he was goaded into praising the
employment policies of Hitler's third reich. He failed to win much support
for a petition drive in January 1992 to outlaw immigration and, after many
changes of view on joining the European Union, he campaigned fruitlessly in
last June's referendum campaign against it.
But he has always bounced back. His appeal comes from his willingness to say
what many people think, with a boyish charm and convincing eloquence. Even
moderate Austrians believe that his demands for reforming patronage-ridden
corporatist institutions, for expelling immigrants caught committing serious
crimes, and for limiting the number of non-German-speaking children in
primary school classrooms are sensible.
Whether he can continue to build his power base with his raucous approach is
questionable. It is hard to imagine how he can reach his long-stated goal of
heading the government after the next election if he remains a purely
opportunistic rebel. Still, his strong position, plus the advance of two
other opposition parties, the left leaning Greens and Liberal Forum, ensures
that Austrian politics will be lively.
It will be more difficult for the coalition partners to agree on policies
between themselves and to impose their will in parliament. Unpopular public
spending cuts, urgently needed to offset the costs of entering the European
Union next year, will be difficult to achieve.
The OVP, hitherto a nearly powerless junior partner in the coalition, can
now threaten to join forces with Mr Haider. The coalition parties will face
rising calls for the demolition or radical reform of many of their
self-serving structures, but in doing so, they would risk offending their
supporters.
Some observers are predicting that the coalition will not last its full
four-year term, but it is difficult to see how prospects for the SPO or the
OVP will look any better in one or two years' time than in four.

FT  11 OCT 94 / German Elections: Greens' leading light goes for broke - The
party has set its sights on a role in a ruling coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Joschka Fischer, once a 1968 revolutionary, then a taxi driver and now
environment minister in the German state of Hesse, leans across the table
after a long day and an exhausting evening on the hustings: 'If we don't
make it this time, then I'm stepping down. I've had enough.'
Mr Fischer is the leading star of the left-wing Greens, Germany's main
environmental party. His impassioned performances and his pleas to party
colleagues to be serious about government have more than anything else
coloured the Green election campaign this year. It is the first time the
party has looked not just for a place on the opposition benches, but to
become part of a future ruling coalition.
To show how serious he is, Mr Fischer even came to Oggersheim, Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's home town on the river Rhine to address a town hall so full
that latecomers were refused entry.
His powers of persuasion have helped change the fortunes of his party, which
managed to win only 3.8 per cent of the vote in the federal elections four
years ago, losing all its seats in parliament. In the latest polls, the
party has been scoring between 7 and 8 per cent. It has also since recovered
a presence in the federal parliament by teaming up with Bundnis 90, the
dissidents who helped topple the former East German regime, but the setback
for the western Greens taught them some important lessons.
First, Mr Fischer's 'realistic' wing of the party - the Realos - who always
wanted power to implement their policies, overcame the 'fundamentalists', or
Fundis, who were more concerned with the purity of their ideas.
The once motley collection of protesters has given way to a more experienced
and older collection of parliamentarians, local politicians and academics.
They have almost become part of the establishment. They could well become
the third force in German politics, instead of the Free Democratic party
(FDP), for decades the junior partner in Bonn coalition governments.
The Greens are part of a coalition government in the northern city state of
Bremen, shared power with the Social Democratic party (SPD) in Lower Saxony
until earlier this year, and are still a vociferous partner in coalition
with the SPD in the state of Hesse.
But for all their polished new image the Greens still like to shock: earlier
this year the party demanded the abolition of the German army, German
withdrawal from Nato, and abolition of the Nato alliance. All of those have
horrified the SPD, the Greens' natural coalition partner in Bonn, and given
welcome election ammunition to the government.
But as the election campaign has picked up speed, leading Greens have been
at pains to play down their more wayward plans, and insist that most things
are up for negotiation.
The only sacred cows in the coalition talks are an end to nuclear energy,
the introduction of speed limits on Germany's overcrowded motorways and a
new tax structure which would reflect the environmental costs of production.
'What we need most of all is a change of direction,' says Mr Ludger Volmer,
joint spokesman for the party, referring to the new taxes. 'If it becomes
clear that there is no change of direction there won't be a coalition with
us.'
But despite the new dynamism, helped along by popular candidates, the party
senses that it may still stumble at the last fence. 'We are just not quite
sure,' as one long-time Green adviser puts it.
The Greens know their core electorate stands at just 4 per cent, one per
cent short of the threshold needed to get seats in the Bundestag. Opinion
polls ahead of previous federal elections have suggested Green support was
markedly higher than it turned out to be on the day. Voters seem to trust
them as a potential member of government at the state level, but not for
Bonn.
One setback has been the party's performance in eastern Germany. Despite the
environmental scars left by the former regime, the Greens have been unable
to mobilise voters there, admitting that for most people worries about the
region's ecology come second to more bread-and-butter concerns like getting
a job.
Instead the Greens have been seeking to woo the better-off, middle-class
voters who have traditionally backed the FDP. The small Liberal party is in
real danger of losing its parliamentary seats, after years of being in
government with either the conservative Christian Democrats or the
left-of-centre SPD.
As far as the Greens are concerned, however, the shift to the political
centre has cost the party the support of some of its more traditional
radical voters.
Germans who supported the party because of what they call its 'instinctive
radicalism' now heckle Green politicians on the hustings and vow they will
back the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the follow-on to the former
East German communist party.
Threats like that do not impress Mr Fischer, who argues that the party has
moved on from mere protest voting.
'People who vote PDS may annoy Kohl,' Mr Fischer said. 'We are fighting for
a majority to get rid of him altogether.'

FT  11 OCT 94 / Sarajevo prepares for third winter of suffering: Survival is
the watchword of all in the city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cold weather has come early to Bosnia. The first blanket of snow on the high
land around Sarajevo signals the start of a third winter of suffering for
the 340,000 people trapped in the besieged capital.
As the war rumbles on around the city, its residents continue to be
threatened by sniper fire and a shortage of food and other supplies. Most
have become anaesthetised to the continuing diplomatic and military efforts.
Hopes raised for a settlement have too often been dashed by the turn of
events.
Instead, the word 'survival' is on everyone's lips as they try to prepare
for the difficult months ahead. 'What more can we do but survive and smile,'
asked Mrs Amela Kurtovic, who has lost three of her family since the start
of the war.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, has vowed to strangle Sarajevo
unless peace can be agreed on his terms. His troops have surrounded the city
since April 1992 and they continue to block United Nations aid convoys when
it suits them. Last weekend, the UN resumed aid flights after a two-week
stoppage, forced by the Bosnian Serbs, during which food reserves became
dangerously low. Sarajevo's mayor, Mr Tareq Kupusovic, said the city had
only two days of reserves and feared that 'if the airport is closed again
before the city has time to build up its reserves there will be a crisis'.
In an attempt to regain some kind of self-sufficiency, many Sarajevans have
planted small allotments throughout the city. Cabbages, carrots and potatoes
grow in what used to be the 1984 Winter Olympics village, only a few hundred
metres from the front line. A screen of overturned cars and buses helps
protect gardeners from Serb snipers.
Nearby, the city's cigarette factory, which produces a few thousand Drina
cigarettes a day from stock left from before the war, has moved its
machinery underground so that production continues whatever conditions on
the streets.
While the UN protects and feeds the city, Sarajevo's civic administration
tries to provide a range of services from public transport and utilities to
a planned reconstruction programme. A rather shaky local tax structure was
introduced at the end of August which levies up to 40 per cent income tax on
commercial enterprises. But revenues are so low that most of the 300 people
working in the city hall are paid in packets of Drinas.
This barely sustainable economic situation is made worse by the constant
threat to life. Nearly nine months after Nato forced the Bosnian Serbs into
signing a ceasefire agreement to remove heavy weapons from a 12-mile zone
around the city, people are still being killed almost daily. On Saturday,
one person was killed and 11 wounded in a sniper attack on a tram in the
city centre. This brought civilian casualties since April, 1992 to 10,078
dead and around 58,500 wounded.
As a result, cars and UN vehicles drive at breakneck speeds and pedestrians
half run to avoid being exposed to the sniper's sights for too long. 'The
place feels like a concentration camp,' says Mrs Ullsija Dzubur who works at
the city hall. 'We know we could be killed at any time.'
Asking the people of Sarajevo how much longer they think the situation can
last elicits only shrugs and sighs.
The future reaches only to the next few days. However, Lt-Gen Sir Michael
Rose, UN commander in Bosnia, is cautiously optimistic that the policy of
isolating the Bosnian Serbs from their former masters in Serbia could end
the impasse.
President Slobodan Milosovic of Serbia cut off nearly all military and
economic supplies to the Bosnian Serbs in early August when Mr Karadzic
rejected the peace plan drawn up the the international contact group. 'The
isolation policy of the contact group is working. . . . but we must be
careful not to make them feel cornered,' he warns.
In the meantime his job is to keep aid flowing. Yesterday, he met Gen Ratko
Mladic, head of the Bosnian Serb army, to try to obtain assurances that
supply routes would stay open. But, while Sarajevo remains under siege - Mr
Karadzic's most important bargaining chip - this is by no means guaranteed.

<TEXT>
Germany's Treuhand privatisation agency yesterday confirmed it would grant
more than DM1bn (Pounds 408m) in subsidies and investments to Eko Stahl,
eastern Germany's largest steelmaker, in a deal which amounts to one of the
largest single rescue packages for an east German company.
However, officials from the Treuhand and from Cockerill-Sambre, the Belgian
steel producer that has bought a 60 per cent stake in Eko Stahl, said they
expected the European Commission to question, if not block, the subsidies.
'Everything now hangs on Brussels,' a Cockerill official said, adding that
the company expected to take over Eko Stahl next January. The remaining 40
per cent will be held by the agency.
The Treuhand's rescue package has two elements: investment grants and
financial assistance to cover current and future losses. The agency will
provide investments and subsidies totalling DM275m, while a further DM385m
will be provided by the federal government and Brandenburg state, where the
mill is located.
In addition the Treuhand has agreed to pick up losses of over DM220m which
will occur between 1995 and 1997. It will also provide an extra DM480m for
compensating losses made by Eko Stahl when its markets in eastern Europe and
the former Soviet Union collapsed after German unification in 1990.
Eko Stahl is expected to make losses of more than DM100m this year on a
turnover of DM1bn more than DM100m. A further DM39m will be allocated to the
local infrastructure.
The Treuhand drew up the final subsidy and investment package at the weekend
after Cockerill agreed to invest DM440m in modernising Eko Stahl's existing
blast furnace and building a new hot-rolling mill.
Cockerill will also guarantee about 2,300 jobs.
Eko Stahl currently employs more than 2,900 people, nearly a quarter less
than in 1990.

Russia has pledged Rbs110bn in aid credits to Armenia, more than half of
which will be used for reactivating a nuclear power station, Russian news

parliament's upper house, announced the aid offer during an official visit
to the former Soviet republic. He said Armenia needed the power station to
combat 'the acute shortage of electricity' which had hampered Armenia's
industrial and economic development. Falling output, soaring prices and an
economic blockade imposed by neighbouring Azerbaijan have pushed Armenia's
living standards to among the lowest of all former Soviet republics.

The Nobel Prize for medicine was awarded yesterday to two Americans, Alfred
Gilman and Martin Rodbell, for pioneering work on the role of proteins in
human cell communication. Sweden's Karolinska Institute, which announced the
SKr7m (Pounds 602,000) award, said the discovery of G-proteins and their
links with the development of disease had been 'of paramount importance'
opening up a 'new and rapidly expanding area of knowledge'. The institute
described the G-protein as a biological 'traffic light' which regulates the
body but can cause illness if it breaks down. Mr Rodbell, 68, of the
National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in North Carolina,
showed in the 1960s and 1970s how messages were carried between cells. His
work was later developed by Mr Gilman, 53, currently chairman of the
pharmacology department at the University of Texas.

Turkish inflation should fall to 20 per cent by the end of the year, thanks
to austerity measures taken in April, when inflation topped 100 per cent and
the exchange rate collapsed, according to Mrs Tansu Ciller, prime minister.
Commenting on the first six months of her emergency economic programme, she
said foreign debt had shrunk by a tenth to Dollars 60bn, central bank
reserves had doubled to Dollars 6.7bn and the current account had swung to a
Dollars 1.1bn surplus between January and July from a Dollars 6.4bn deficit
in 1993. Sharply curtailed public spending brought the budget deficit in the
first seven months down to Dollars 586m, almost half the expected amount.

The extreme right made further inroads into the Belgian political scene over
the weekend, with voters in Flanders, Wallonia and the Brussels region
giving their support to anti-immigration parties in Sunday's communal
elections. In Antwerp, the principal city of Belgium's Dutch-speaking
Flanders region, the racist Flemish Nationalist party, Vlaams Blok, won 28
per cent of the vote, making it the city's leading political party. The
National Front, the francophone extreme right, gained a foothold in the 19
communes of the country's capital Brussels, while in Wallonia, the
French-speaking region, the big cities saw similar advances by the far
right. In Liege they won four seats.
The communal elections, held every six years, focus mainly on local issues
and will have little immediate impact on the fortunes of the federal
governing coalition, led by Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the prime minister.
Meanwhile King Albert last night named Mr Frank Vandenbroucke, president of
the Flemish Socialist party, as foreign minister and deputy prime minister
in succession to Mr Willy Claes, who is to become Nato secretary-general. Mr
Johan Vande Lanotte, a Socialist MP, replaces interior minister Louis
Tobback, who was elected mayor of Leuven on Sunday.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italian prime minister, yesterday promised speedy
introduction of legislation to prevent a conflict of interest with his
ownership of Fininvest, Italy's second largest private business group. A
report by three jurists, commissioned by Mr Berlusconi in May, last weekend
recommended a special conflict of interest law. Making his first comment
since receiving the report, the premier hinted he was not entirely happy
with it. 'It seems to me the solution found is tough and inflexible, more
inflexible than in other countries,' he said.
The jurists said Mr Berlusconi could not to be forced to divest ownership of
Fininvest; but he would have to consider either voluntary divestiture or
appointment of a trustee while he held office. By committing himself to
early legislation, Mr Berlusconi appeared anxious to resolve the issue
quickly. Since gaining office five months ago, he has consistently
encountered problems created by his inability to distance himself from his
ownership of a business empire which spans television, films, publishing,
chain stores and financial services. The senate began debating the report
yesterday, as government members argued for prior agreement on the
legislation to ensure a swift passage through parliament.

FT  11 OCT 94 / EU roadblock on Greek infrastructure plans: Brussels is
holding back funding until Athens can convince it that the money will be
spent wisely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The six-lane highway that shrinks abruptly into a country lane is both a
familiar feature of the Greek landscape and an unpleasant reminder of the
financial and administrative muddle that hinders successive governments'
attempts at infrastructure improvement.
Things were supposed to change with the launch this year of the European
Union's new structural package, intended to help poorer member states like
Greece move towards the Maastricht targets for economic convergence.
However, the European Commission has placed a temporary block on
disbursement of Ecu4bn (Pounds 3.14bn) of Greece's share of the funding,
which amounts to Ecu14bn by the year 2000. The block covers nine large
programmes for motorways, ports and other transport projects.
A Commission official said Greece's public works ministry had failed to
convince Brussels that it had implemented reforms needed to ensure the money
would be wisely spent.
These include modernisation of costing procedures, improved efficiency and
the establishment of special independent agencies to manage large and
complex projects.
The funding delay is worrying Greece's economic planners as the EU package
is seen as crucial to stimulating economic recovery after three years in
which growth in gross domestic product has stagnated at around 1 per cent.
Among the projects due to get under way by the end of 1994 are an Ecu450m
suspension bridge across the Corinth Gulf, a Dr120bn (Pounds 320m)
underground railway for the northern city of Thessaloniki and a Dollars
1.6bn (Pounds 1bn) new airport for Athens. All had been stuck at the
planning stage for more than a decade, mainly because of chronic constraints
on the public investment budget.
While the three projects contain an element of self-financing, they are also
eligible for substantial EU grants as well as soft loans from the European
Investment Bank.
The EU structural funds will also cover up to 80 per cent of the cost of
completing the 600km Egnatia highway from Greece's western coast to the
border with Turkey, as well as that of upgrading the 580km north-south
highway from Athens to the Macedonian border to international motorway
standard.
As a result of the Commission's block on the funding, only one contract of
any size has been signed: an Ecu40.2m project for a British-Greek joint
venture to build a seabed tunnel between the western Greek ports of Aktion
and Preveza.
The Commission has also warned the government that its efforts to change the
terms of the Athens airport project risk violating EU rules on tendering
procedures. The project was awarded last year to Hochtief of Germany but no
contract was signed. Meanwhile, the government has resumed negotiations with
Societe Auxiliaire d'Entreprises de France, the losing bidder.
The Thessaloniki underground railway project is also in trouble. Macedonian
Metro, a Greek-led consortium, challenged the public works ministry in court
last month after its financing arrangements were rejected by a ministry
committee as insecure.
To back their legal protest, consortium officials made public copies of
letters from the EIB, the German state-owned development bank Kreditanstalt
fur Wideraufbau (KFW) and Citibank, offering loans equivalent to more than
Dr120bn (Pounds 320m).
The alarm had already been triggered in Brussels by a succession of bids
from Greece's small and fiercely competitive construction companies for
EU-financed highway and harbour contracts valued at more than Dr150bn. Some
were offering discounts of up to 80 per cent of the tender price.
'Discounts are in order because of the ministry's old-fashioned costing
procedures, which don't take account of the productivity of modern
equipment,' said a Greek banker. 'But anything over 40 to 50 per cent
suggests the company might not be able to fulfil the project
specifications.'
A public works ministry official said negotiations were under way with
contractors to come up with 'more realistic' offers to avoid the delay that
would be caused by cancelling the tenders and calling for new bids.
The ministry said it had started to modernise costing procedures dating from
the 1960s. It was also committed to improving efficiency by raising to
Dr25bn the present Dr5bn limit on the value of a project that can be
undertaken by a single Greek company.
'The ceiling has meant delays and poor quality construction, particularly in
highway building, where small segments of a few kilometres each are
parcelled out among different contractors,' said an Athens-based financial
consultant.
Yet Greece's problems with the Commission over the new funding package go
deeper. Contractors and consultants agree the government's political
commitment to reform is not in doubt, but note there is strong resistence
among officials at the public works ministry to reducing their control over
infrastructure projects.
The need for radical change is underlined by the ministry's lack of adequate
expertise to handle technical studies for big construction projects in areas
such as geological and environmental impact surveys.
Moreover, the Commission's determination to extract maximum value from the
new funding package means there is increased pressure to improve controls on
costs and ensure the quality of construction is effectively monitored.
However, the ministry has not yet agreed to the establishment of special
agencies, to be staffed mainly from the private sector and other government
departments, to manage large and complex projects on an independent basis.
Among other things, these would contribute much-needed expertise on
financing arrangements for partly self-financed projects.

inflation was also expected to drop to 5.5 per cent from 6.5 per cent last
year. Mr Fernando Faria de Oliveira, trade and tourism minister, said
inflation would be less than 2.5 points higher than the European Union
average by the end of 1994. Figures for September, to be officially
announced later this week, would show a further drop compared with August.
Average annual inflation in 1995 should be 3.5-4.5 per cent.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Employers dig in over cost-cutting: German engineering
bosses pre-empt union wage demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's engineering employers yesterday called for the planned
35-hour-week in the industry to be renegotiated as part of a package to save
jobs and cut costs.
In a pre-emptive strike on the eve of the annual wage demand from IG Metall,
the engineering workers' union, the employers served notice that
cost-cutting remains the absolute priority for the industry, still reeling
from last year's economic downturn.
The union is expected to table a claim today for a wage rise in excess of
the inflation rate, designed to compensate for real pay cuts over the past
year, and to reflect an increase in productivity forecast at more than 3 per
cent.
The employers' move to renegotiate the 35-hour week, the most hard-fought
achievement of the engineering workers in recent years, seems certain to
infuriate the union leaders, who were forced to accept a virtual pay freeze
for their members last year.
But Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, the president of Gesamtmetall, the
engineering employers' federation, warned yesterday: 'The shortening of the
working week limits the room for any wage increase.' He added that the
planned 35-hour week, due to come into effect from October 1, 1995, should
be renegotiated as part of a package aimed at more flexible working
practices, and an overall cut in costs.
Mr Gottschol said that the wave of redundancies through the engineering
industry, which was running at 30,000 a month last year, had finally halted,
not least thanks to the job security deal involved in last year's pay
settlement. That deal allowed individual employers to put their staff on to
short-time working without full compensation in their pay packets, as an
alternative to outright redundancies.
His five-point plan includes an extension of the current deal on short-time
working and job security, cost-cutting, renegotiating the 35-hour week,
negotiating a special deal to employ the long-term unemployed, and seeking
more flexibility in the wage package to give relief to small and
medium-sized enterprises.
The number of short-time workers in the industry has now sunk from 750,000
at the low point of the recession in 1993 to 80,000 today, Mr Gottschol
said. He forecast a growth rate of 3 to 4 per cent in the electrical and
mechanical engineering industry as a whole in 1994, but warned that the
effects of the recovery were very patchy.
Since mid-1991, 750,000 jobs had been lost in the west German engineering
industry because of the pressure of costs, and the loss of orders.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Rise in raw material prices fuels UK fears of inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of raw materials used by British manufacturers rose significantly
last month as the surge in world commodity prices pushed up the expense of
imported materials.
The rise fuelled fears that there could be price pressures in the pipeline
which might increase the UK's currently low inflation rate.
The cost of goods leaving factory gates last month rose at a relatively
subdued rate, suggesting that many companies are still being forced to
absorb the rising costs.
The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that the price of goods
purchased by manufacturing industry rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.7 per
cent last month and by 5.7 per cent in the 12 months to September.
The rise was larger than the City had expected. In August the annual growth
rate was 3.9 per cent.
The cost of goods leaving factory gates increased by 0.2 per cent in
September, however. Measured without the volatile elements of food,
beverages, tobacco and petroleum, output price inflation grew by a
seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent in September and by 2.1 per cent over the
12 months.
The prices of imported materials, especially commodities such as coffee and
copper, rose particularly sharply. Consequently, the sharpest price
increases were reported in manufacturing sectors with greater exposure to
world commodity prices, such as the pulp and paper, metals, rubbers and
chemicals sectors.
The Treasury said yesterday that the underlying inflation trends remained
very benign.
'This is a sharp price increase, but it is from a pretty low level,' it
said. In addition, any rise in material costs should be partly offset by the
fact that unit wage costs - the key component of business costs  - had
fallen slightly.
Nevertheless, City economists yesterday pointed out that last month's rise
had come after several months of increases in output costs.
Some analysts suggested that this indicated companies were increasingly
seeking to pass on the recent price increases.
Others argued that customer resistance to price increases remained strong
and warned that the recent surge in commodity prices might squeeze corporate
margins in those sectors that were highly commodity dependent.

FT  11 OCT 94 / US boosts Gulf airpower as Iraq hints at retreat: UK to send
marines, six fighters and a destroyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, ROBIN ALLEN and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO, KUWAIT, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton early today boosted US airpower to 350 warplanes for
defending Kuwait and backing up US ground forces, in spite of Baghdad's
claim it was pulling troops back from the Gulf state's border.
In a televised address President Clinton, who cancelled a trip to New
Jersey, to deal with the crisis, said there was no evidence that Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein had redeployed his 80,000 troops from the border.
'We are interested in facts, not promises . . . we will not allow Saddam
Hussein to defy the will of the US and the international community,' he said
in a stern message to Iraq.
The President's announcement of an increase in military aircraft came
several hours after a DC-10 aircraft disgorged into Kuwait the first 300 US
troops of a 36,000-strong US ground force bound for the Gulf state. The
decision to send as many as 350 tactical aircraft, including F-15 fighters
and B-52 bombers, along with the aircraft carrier USS George Washington
group and dozens of other naval vessels, makes it the biggest US military
deployment in the Middle East since the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
Britain, which has already sent a frigate to the Gulf, said it was planning
to send 800 marines, six Tornado fighters and a destroyer, HMS Cardiff, in
the next 24 hours unless it was clear a withdrawal had taken place.
Amid rising international calls for Baghdad to reverse its deployment Iraq's
foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf, and its UN ambassador, Nizar
Hamdoon, both said Iraqi forces were pulling back from Kuwait's border to
positions north of the southern city of Basra.
'The troops are already on the move,' Mr Hamdoon said late yesterday.
However, the US Defence Department said it had no confirmation of the
claimed withdrawal and would continue its military buildup. 'In fact, it's
the opposite. More have been moving in,' a senior official said.
UN and Kuwaiti officials, meanwhile, reported the Kuwait-Iraq border to be
relatively calm though UN observers in the 15km demilitarised zone
straddling the frontier said thousands of people, claimed by Iraq to be
stateless Arabs displaced from Kuwait during the Gulf war, continued to
assemble from the Iraqi side in a 'tent city' just north of the zone. They
have been demanding the right to return to Kuwait.
Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said that by yesterday Iraq had
deployed, or was moving, up to 80,000 troops near the Kuwait border. 'We
believe there are two Republican Guard divisions either already at the
border or nearly there, and a third one, which is in the northern part of
the country, is on the move now, and we expect it will be going to the
border as well.' Iraq's deployment was apparently aimed at pressing the UN
Security Council to consider an immediate lifting of the four-year-old oil
embargo which has pushed Iraq into economic crisis.
Diplomats said the Iraqi troop deployment had made such a relaxation
impossible to contemplate for France, Russia, China and other Security
Council members previously sympathetic to Iraq's case.
Oil markets have reacted calmly to the tension. Showing little change from
the Friday's close.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Thatcher denies impropriety in arms deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, ROBERT PESTON, WILLIAM LEWIS and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baroness Thatcher yesterday denied there was any financial impropriety in
the Pounds 20bn Al Yamamah arms contract with Saudi Arabia which she helped
to win. She was responding to allegations that her son, Mr Mark Thatcher,
received millions of pounds in commissions on the deal.
Mr Thatcher also insisted that he had 'made no money' from the UK's biggest
defence contract, and the Conservative party chairman, Mr Jeremy Hanley,
tried to prevent the affair overshadowing his party's annual conference.
Amid signs of growing concern among senior ministers, Mr Hanley rejected
Labour calls for a public inquiry, but said the allegations could be
investigated by Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary.
Mr Thatcher would not elaborate on his role in the negotiations. However, he
has told friends that his current net worth is significantly less than the
Pounds 12m he is alleged to have received from Saudi Arabia.
Lady Thatcher, who was prime minister when the first part of the deal was
signed in 1985, defended the propriety of the negotiations in terms which
appeared designed to rule out any further allegations against those
involved, including Mr Thatcher.
'Lady Thatcher is absolutely satisfied that the Al Yamamah contract was
properly negotiated between the governments of Saudi Arabia and the UK,' her
statement said.
However, a former Ministry of Defence official closely involved in the
negotiations said: 'Mark certainly tried to generate the impression that he
had influence (over the possible outcome of the Al Yamamah talks). He was
putting himself around a lot.'
The main beneficiary of the deal was British Aerospace, the defence and
aviation group. Sir Raymond Lygo, BAe's managing director at the time, said
Mrs Thatcher's personal intervention in the negotiations had been crucial to
winning the deal against stiff opposition from France.
He added: 'She intervened at our (BAe's) request. We went into Downing
Street and asked whether the prime minister could be diverted to drop in (to
Saudi Arabia)'.
He was not aware that Mr Thatcher played any role in persuading his mother
to become involved.
Mr Hanley, asked whether Mr Thatcher's reported role in the deal breached
the rules and procedures for ministers - the ethical guidelines issued to
ministers - said: 'If that is the allegation, then the cabinet secretary
would be the proper authority.'
Mr Hanley sought to distance the government from the allegations by
suggesting that ministers were not answerable for Mr Thatcher's actions. He
admitted that the controversy threatened to overshadow the conference and
said he was not aware of plans for senior ministers to discuss the
allegations about Mr Thatcher. However, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
said it would be discussed.
Mr John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, said: 'Mr Hanley is out of his
depth and sinking in a deep blue sea of sleaze.'
A former government official who was a close personal adviser to Mrs
Thatcher at the time of the negotiations denied that the former prime
minister had allowed her son to profit from the deal. 'Knowing the way the
prime minister worked, as I do, I can tell you that that allegation is
laughable,' he said.
Lady Thatcher is expected to arrive at the conference today and to fly to
the US to give a speech near Dallas, where her son lives, on Wednesday.
MoD officials were worried yesterday that media coverage of the Mark
Thatcher allegations might damage prospects of continuing lucrative
contracts with Saudi Arabia.
The MoD said that Sir Clive Whitmore, its former permament secretary, had
denied warning Mrs Thatcher about the potentially damaging consequences of
her son's alleged involvement in the negotiations.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Lucas shares climb despite Pounds 214m restructuring costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Extensive restructuring by Lucas Industries is to cost the UK automotive and
aerospace components group a total of Pounds 214m in exceptional charges,
double previous forecasts.
Shares in Lucas, however, rose yesterday by 17p to 194p as the City reacted
positively to the new strategic direction outlined by Mr George Simpson, who
took over as chief executive of the Birmingham-based company in June.
Mr Simpson, former chairman of Rover Group, is focusing on three areas -
automotive, aerospace and electronics. One aim is to shorten response times
and improve service levels to increasingly demanding manufacturers.
He also announced the planned disposal of two aerospace businesses in the US
 -Lucas Communications and Electronics and Lucas Aviation, which between
them employ 550 people.
Mr Simpson said: 'It is quite clear that three of our core business areas
must be restructured if they are to achieve a competitive edge and maximise
their contribution to future earnings.'
Job losses at the group - which during the financial year cut its workforce
by 3,200 to 45,700 - would be 'hundreds rather than thousands', he said.
The provisions led to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 129.7m for the year to July
31, compared with profits of Pounds 49.5m last time. Operating profit rose
by 40 per cent to Pounds 84.2m. Sales were flat at Pounds 2.6bn but,
excluding divestments, grew by 7 per cent.
Sir Anthony Gill, chairman, was confident the progress already demonstrated
in underlying performance would be maintained, so the final dividend had
been held at 4.9p to give an unchanged total of 7p.
The biggest chunk of provisions was the Pounds 94.3m writedown of goodwill
on businesses earmarked for sale, which has no effect on shareholders'
funds. Another Pounds 87.6m covers the future costs of restructuring and
anticipated costs of settling legal claims in the US, where the group has
been accused of failing to fulfil government defence contracts.
Mr Simpson said: 'It is important to note that less than 40 per cent of such
provisions have a direct cash implication and this will be, in the main,
offset by planned divestment proceeds.'

FT  10 OCT 94 / US drug tests raise hopes for anti-influenza cure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clinical trials in the US of an anti-influenza drug have raised hopes of a
cure on the market within the next three years.
Tests on 46 volunteers infected with the flu virus showed that the drug,
developed by the UK company Glaxo, cut their infectiousness 100-fold. It
also cut the period for which they were infectious by half to less than two
days.
Infectiousness, measured by the number of new viruses shed from the
patient's nose, is a way researchers quantify effectiveness. Dr Frederick
Hayden of the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, who conducted the
trials, said the volunteers also had fewer flu symptoms.
Clinical trials involving another 600 people this winter should help set the
dose for the drug and determine when is the best time to take it. If such
trials are successful, Glaxo intends to submit the drug for regulatory
approval in 1996. A product could reach the market later that year or, more
likely, in 1997.
No treatment today is very effective because the flu virus changes shape
frequently. A flu vaccine immunises against three or four of these shapes,
or strains, leaving people vulnerable to any others they may encounter. Such
is the speed of mutation of the virus that new flu jabs are required each
year.
The new drug was developed by researchers at Monash University in Australia
and is licenced by Glaxo from Australian biotechnology company Biota. It
works by interfering with an enzyme the flu virus uses to break into healthy
body cells.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The good news from US carmakers looks set to continue into the final months
of this year. Despite the potential damage done to sales by higher interest
rates, all three big producers continue to have trouble meeting demand.
Chrysler, which tomorrow will be the first of the three to report
third-quarter figures, made Dollars 350m after tax a year ago: this time,
most expectations are running at about Dollars 550m. Mr David Healy, motors
analyst at SG Warburg in New York, is even more optimistic. With vehicle
sales up by as much as 100,000 over a year ago, net income could reach
Dollars 750m, he says.

made FFr1.1bn in the first half last year. Profits on insurance may be
dragged down slightly by continuing - though smaller - losses at Banque
Worms. There will be no reflection in the results of recent acquisitions,
including Provincial, the UK non-life company, and the outstanding shares in
Colonia, the German insurer.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (22): Wait for the last call -
Stewart Dalby gauges the views of three seasoned travellers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
One business traveller of my acquaintance, who is constantly on the move,
likes to retail the following story.
A man presents himself at the check-in desk in Los Angeles. The woman at the
counter says: 'You are flying to Denver, sir?' 'Yes, I am,' comes the reply.
'And you have three pieces of baggage, is that correct?'
'Yes. But I would like one piece to go to Chicago. One piece to Miami and
the third to New York.'
'Pardon? That is very irregular. I could not possibly do that.'
'Why not, you did it last week.'
My acquaintance admits the story is apocryphal and says baggage going
astray, at least in the US, is now rare compared with 10 years ago.
But Dr David Arnold, an executive with Thorn Secure Systems, a subsidiary of
Thorn EMI, adds: 'I usually try to travel with just one piece of baggage. If
it is a short trip, I try to take everything I need in one bag and carry it
on the aircraft with me.
Mr John Flory, a 28-year-old 'information arbitrageur' with a London
company, Crawfords, agrees.
'I would never take more than one piece of luggage, if I can possibly avoid
it. In fact, I usually just take expensive clothes like suits and shirts and
buy socks and things when I get there.'
Mr David Appleby, a newspaper executive, says on the subject of baggage:
'Even on long trips I try to take everything on to the aircraft with me. You
can get these airline bags which you can wheel along and then put in the
overhead racks or underneath the seat.
'You can put all your essential documents and toiletries in them. Then you
can take a suit bag. Put your your suits and shirts in it and hang it up on
the aircraft. Most airlines allow this nowadays.'
Mr Appleby also thinks it is worthwhile checking out which airlines allow
the use of personal computers. Most airlines forbid mobile phones, but some
allow computers.
'It can make a hell of a difference, if on a long flight, you can get a
paper written.'
All three business travellers believed in waiting for the last call for the
aircraft before boarding a flight.
As for money, there is a consensus among business travellers that the best
way to travel is to take cash and use credit and charge cards as much as
possible. Traveller's cheques, especially if they are not in a local
currency can cost money not only because of handling fees but also in
possible exchange losses.
Mr Flory says: 'I change a little cash on my departure for taxis at the
other end. When I am at my destination I shop around the money-changers for
the best rate. I never take traveller's cheques. I use cards whenever
possible.'
Is he not worried about theft and muggings?
'I have never had any problems,' he replies.
Dr Arnold also favours credit cards and cash. He says: 'I was in the US for
a week recently. I spent Dollars 1,500. I took Dollars 150 in cash and
Dollars 150 in traveller's cheques. You must have some cash. The traveller's
cheques are a precaution. I usually give them back uncashed.'
Mr Appleby also favours extensive use of cards, even to countries formerly
in the Soviet Union. He says: 'There is not much point taking traveller's
cheques to the former Soviet Union. It has to be dollars. But if you are
worried about security, credit cards are the answer.
'In the former Soviet Union, the usual credit cards are accepted, in most
hotels and restaurants in the main centres.'
Mr Appleby makes the point that it is best to use company credit cards. He
says: 'If you use your own credit cards you are in effect making a cheap
loan to your company, since it is your money being used upfront. It is best
to claim the money back quickly.'
He feels that it is a false economy to try to save money by staying in cheap
hotels. He says: 'You are travelling on business. Time is usually at a
premium. You need a good laundry and dry-cleaning service. You also need a
reliable front desk, which takes messages and passes them on. Usually you
will need a fax and secretarial service.'
Dr Arnold agrees. He says: 'I always stay in hotels where I can get work
done.'
Business travellers are, generally speaking, not great tourists. Dr Arnold
says: 'I rarely have time to see the sights.'
Nor does Mr Appleby have much time for tourism. 'But I do read up on
countries before I visit them. The Rough Guides are useful. I know they are
meant to be for backpackers, but I find they have the best detailed
information on restaurants and other things.'
The Travel Bookshop in London's Notting Hill says there is such a large
selection of guide books that, with new ones appearing every year, the
choice is limitless.
Guide books are subject to fashion. Old favourites among business travellers
such as the Fodor and Insight guides are no longer so keenly sought.
A current favourite among business travellers, according to the Travel
Bookshop, is the upmarket Cadogan guides. They open with practical hints and
have sections on history and suggestions for walks and other attractions.
Prices start at Pounds 9.95.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (21): Magnates rent hidden villas
on the cliffs - Staying on / Andrew Hill finds plenty of big fish in
Portofino
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even if you have never been to Portofino, you may have heard of it. If you
haven't heard of it, you've certainly heard of the people who have.
Guy de Maupassant, Nietzsche, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Truman
Capote, Rex Harrison and Richard Burton were all enchanted by the tiny
Ligurian port. Its reputation for attracting the high life is such that it
is probably the only fishing village in the world to have a Swiss watch
named after it.
There may not be many fishermen in Portofino now, but there are still plenty
of big fish. Italian magnates rent the hidden villas barnacled on to the
cliffs on either side of the cove, while the international crowd moor their
giant yachts offshore or thread them between the fishing boats to reach the
harbour itself. All summer, ocean-going eyesores float in front of the
trompe l'oeil pastel facades, as ugly as two-storey caravans abandoned on a
medieval village green.
Tenders from Cunard cruise ships, anchored in the bay, shuttle passengers
back and forth between their floating hotels and the luxury boutiques and
expensive restaurants around the harbour, while fat American families wobble
down into the village from the Dollars 520-a-night, 63-room Splendido just
above the port.
For those who can't get a hotel room in high summer, there are still a few
options. You could make an early bid for one of the limited places in the
village's new (and cleverly concealed) multi-storey car park.
Alternatively, take the regular ferry from down the coast, or do as the
Italians do and ride in on a Vespa from neighbouring Santa Margherita and
Rapallo to stroll and gawp, fragrant focaccia - the local pizza-like snack -
in one hand, scooter helmet in the other.
Given its obvious popularity, it seems odd that Liguria's best-known resort
is going out of its way to promote itself internationally. Yet Gianni
Artioli, Portofino's mayor, insists that by the mid-1980s the village had an
image problem. 'We'd slipped a little in quality: the village had become a
holiday place and nothing more', he says. 'There was a need to do something,
to stimulate something.'
Like all good politicians, Artioli traces the transformation in local
fortunes to the beginning of his own term in office in 1986. What started as
a couple of evenings of jazz in the piazza last year became 'Portofino,
Porto d'Arte', an ambitious summer arts festival.
That means that you no longer have to be a gawper or a preener to enjoy
Portofino in the summer, and there is a more eclectic mix of visitors on the
waterfront. Italy's prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, is a frequent
visitor to Portofino.
This year Mr Berlusconi's alleged dinner-table indiscretions about allies
and enemies made front-page news, and no doubt enhanced the takings of the
Puny restaurant where he made them. Also there was Aldo Busi, the flamboyant
bad boy of contemporary Italian literature. His dramatic monologue
Clementina Gnoccoli (an extract from his book, Sodomies in Elevenpoint), was
premiered in the village's 120-seat Teatrino during the festival.
Not that Portofino is trying to shake off its glitzy image. As Paola Brusati
Paleari, the festival's artistic director, puts it: 'The middle- to low-brow
tourists don't find much which is interesting in Portofino.'
The beaches on the promontory are disappointingly small, privately owned or
occupied by regiments of pay-as-you-bronze deckchairs, and the former
fisherfolk know that the average yacht owner will pay handsomely for local
specialities such as pesto sauce or the triangular filled pasta, pansotti,
and charge accordingly.
But the village benefits from the festival. For example, the artistic
initiative has just reached Castello Brown, perched above the harbour. The
ancient fortress of San Giorgio, which was the setting for the feature film
Enchanted April, was the residence of a Mr Yeats Brown, the British consul
in Genoa who 'discovered' Portofino in 1870.
This year, for the first time, the castle was transformed into a
rough-and-ready exhibition space. Restoration of the interior should follow,
together with the repainting of the extravagantly decorated facades of the
fishing cottages in the harbour. In the meantime the exhibition - a
collection of Italian fashion photography - will travel as far as Gothenburg
and Yokohama, spreading the name of Portofino.
Seeing the crowded centre in summer, you have to hope that greater fame will
alert some tourists to the charms of Portofino out of season. Even the
Splendido languished half-empty when it opened for the first time last
winter. It does so again this year.
Not that you see a more authentic Portofino in the closed season, just a
quieter one. Thanks to conservation schemes, wild boar are supposed to have
returned to the woods behind the harbour, but no amount of cultural
initiatives can bring back, say, the village school or local life
independent of the summer rush.
'In the south, you hear about villages which are empty because of poverty',
says the mayor in a rare moment of nostalgia. 'Here, people have moved out
because of wealth.' Yeats Brown has a lot to answer for.

Nazionale in the centre of the village, tel: (0185)-269575, fax: -269578

FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (20): Watering place that holds
its popularity - Staying on / Chris McCooey sniffs the bracing air of Ostend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS MCCOOEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you drive into Ostend from the motorway that connects it with Calais or
Brussels, you cannot fail to see the imposing bottom of a huge female statue
about a kilometre from the seafront.
The lady, wrought in green-tinged copper, reclines on her side looking out
to sea, although her view of the waves is blocked by an ugly concrete
edifice.
The well-built lady straddles the central reservation of the wide Leopold II
Laan and although her nakedness is partly concealed by fountains she seems
to symbolise the worldly pleasures of Ostend, including the good food and
drink that I found here during a one-week stay.
Ostend's fortunes have fluctuated over the centuries. The old fishing
village on the flat and windswept North Sea coast was given a town charter
in the 13th century, in recognition of its growing importance as a port for
trade across the Channel.
Flanked on both sides by an empty expanse of sand dune, it remained the only
important harbour along this stretch of coast until the construction of
Zeebrugge in the 19th century.
It was at this time that Ostend began to get pretensions. Or rather, the
newly created King Leopold I of the Belgians wanted to do for Ostend what
England's Prince Regent (later George IV) had done for the Sussex coast
village of Brighthelmstone.
On January 20 1831, the London Conference recognised Belgium's independence
from Holland and proclaimed the country 'a perpetually neutral' state. The
crown was accepted by Prince Leopold, son of the Duke of
Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and the uncle of Queen Victoria (he was much in demand
for performing regal roles: in 1816 he had married Charlotte, only child of
the British Prince Regent and heiress presumptive to the throne, but she
died in childbirth the following year - and in 1830 he was offered but
declined the Greek throne).
Leopold chose Ostend for a royal residence in 1834 and set about taking the
town upmarket. The rail connection with Brussels meant that it was easily
accessible.
First, the king ordered that the old city walls (it had been attacked and
besieged many times over the centuries) be pulled down so that it could
expand along the seafront. Elegant summer houses and swish hotels were
constructed and parks laid out.
By the seaside, wide promenades were built for the fashionable to stroll
along, taking in the bracing air, clearing the head, for the hedonistic
delights of the evening to come which invariably centred around the
Casino-Kursaal on the seafront. Completed in 1852, it was where concerts
were performed by the great orchestras of Europe, ballets danced, operas
sung and paintings admired. There were also gaming rooms and restaurants
which catered for those who came to the resort in the appropriate seasons to
see and be seen.
The grandly named Wellington Hippodrome (after the Iron Duke, who performed
his most heroic deed on Belgian soil) was built just out of town, literally
a stone's throw from the sea; trotting and flat races were held here (and
still are). A tram system - still in use today - was laid out. Leopold II
kept up the good work and then his son Albert, in turn, continued to
patronise the resort. By 1900, the Baedeker travel guide distinguished
Ostend as 'one of the most fashionable and cosmopolitan watering places in
Europe'.
This century two wars and two periods of German occupation have taken their
toll, as have periodic downturns in economic activity. Ostend has lost its
exclusiveness but retains popularity for many laid-back Belgians - today
'raffish' seems a more appropriate adjective then 'fashionable'.
During the last war Ostend was in the front line - bombs destroyed much of
what remained of the old fishing and port town that predated the royal
connection - as well as the fine buildings that the royal family encouraged
in the 19th century. In their place, concrete and glass hotels and
apartments have been hastily erected, functional for those that live in them
but unappealing to the eye.
Typical is the casino on the same site as the original.
This is the edifice that blocks our female friend's view of the sea (the
statue is called De See - The Sea - and was sculptured by Georges Grand of
Tournai in 1965). Built in 1953 in the austere post-war years, the
building's concrete facade is crumbling as the salt air eats into its
fabric. But inside, it remains the cultural heart of the town. Modern
painters and sculptors exhibit in the galleries, and there is a fine
auditorium.
However, this is no longer the Belgian equivalent of Glyndebourne: the
Chippendales, a couple of Flemish stand-up comedians, a Broadway company on
tour with the sex and drugs anti-Vietnam musical Hair and the Glen Miller
Band - to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Belgium from
the Nazis - were on the bill for the summer months.
There are still restaurants and gaming rooms (although a private club,
visitors can secure a daily membership by paying BFr100 and showing a
passport).
When the sun shines, the miles of lifeguarded and sandy beaches that stretch
from the harbour entrance all the way west to De Panne attract tens of
thousands, especially families with young children. Cafes spill on to the
foreshore with glass screens to keep the windblown sand from the coffees and
cokes and beers and ice creams.
People still like to stroll along the promenade atop the massive sea wall,
as they did in Leopold's day. Or you can hire pedal cars that seat up to six
people for BFr80 per person for 30 minutes, or take a horse and carriage
ride for BFr400. Belgians are mindful of public hygiene - the horses have
nappies and the vending machines on the seafront sell paper bags so that the
owners of the town's many dogs can clean up their pets' poop.
The town remains cosmopolitan. The harbour, marina and Montgomery Dok
attract yachts from all over Europe and beyond - they tie up, cheek by jowl,
their sleek hulls gleaming, masts at attention, rigging jangling in the
breeze. Jet foils and ferries arrive every couple of hours and disgorge
passengers from up and down continental Europe and from across the North
Sea. Loud and loutish groups of daytripping Britons are a common sight -
reeling from bar to bar, they are tolerated for their spending but despised
for their foul language and vomiting.
Right next door to the ferry terminal is the station with trains to Antwerp
or Brussels, and beyond to Holland and Germany.
And adjacent to that is the coastal tram terminus where you can get tickets
to go east to Knokke-Heist and west to De Panne.
In the seven nights I stayed in Ostend I ate some of the best meals that I
have had anywhere in the world. They included Malaysian, Chinese, Italian
and Turkish dishes. If it is seafood you are after, then Vissers Kaai is the
place to go - it fronts the eastern side of the town and overlooks
Montgomery Dok. On the townside are numerous restaurants and on the quayside
are stalls selling snacks. For one meal I had what amounted to a bucketful
of mussels in a Provencal soup with a huge plate of French fries for BFr500.
Another day, for a snack, I tried 'warme wulloks' - a tub of whelks in a
spicy and hot soup (BFr100) followed by a piece of smoked eel (BFr100) and
rounded off with a piquant, chewy rollmop herring (BFr30).
Baedeker's description 'watering hole' remains as true today as it was a
century ago. If you like beer, then you'll like Belgium and Ostend has
countless watering holes, some of which specialise only in beer, stocking
over 100 different varieties. Many of the numerous Belgium breweries have
their own distinctive glasses for their own beer. If you order a wonderfully
named Kwac beer, it will be served in what looks like an alchemist's vessel
 -a glass with a bulbous base, a narrow waist and a wider drinking end and
held upright in a wooden holder.
If you are in need of 'hair of the dog', then the aptly named Delirium
Tremens can be ordered. The pink elephants on the bottle and drinking glass
are a nice touch, as was the notice over the bar where I sampled one, purely
for research purposes: please respect the privacy and rest of other guests.
Other beers, like some brewed by Duvel and Hoegaarden, are re-fermented in
the bottle so pour carefully to leave the yeasty sediment behind.
With alcoholic strength up to 12 per cent just a couple of bottle beers
should get you feeling quite mellow.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (18): Looking after your luggage -
Airlines have tightened up their procedures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATE BEVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You know the feeling. You're standing in the baggage hall long after
everyone else on your flight has collected their bags, watching two
suitcases doing desultory circuits of the conveyor belt - and neither of
them is yours.
Meanwhile, your suitcase is probably making similar sad circuits at another
airport - not necessarily in the same country or even the same continent.
Theoretically, of course, this should not happen. Airlines have tightened up
their procedures in the wake of the Lockerbie bombing, which was traced to a
bag travelling unaccompanied. And if you're flying business or first class,
your bag should have a tag indicating that it belongs to a premium class
passenger and should be handled accordingly.
There are steps you can take to prevent your luggae going astray. The most
important thing you can do is not check in your bags - a golden rule for
regular travellers is to carry as much as possible as hand luggage.
Airlines are a bit sticky about how much you can carry on, so some
passengers will go to extraordinary lengths.
Mr Mark McCormack, founder of the International Management Group, recommends
in Hit the Ground Running, his guide to hassle-free executive travel, that
you get someone else to look after your bags, out of sight of the desk,
while you check in unencumbered by anything more than an innocent suitpack
and briefcase. Then you retrieve your other bags and proceed to the gate
where, with a bit of luck, you can convince the agent that the check-in desk
said it was OK for you to carry on your other encumbrances.
This may be a desperate measure but it does spare you from the lonely vigil
by the baggage carousel.
Generally, in first and business class, you can carry on an overnight bag, a
briefcase (or a handbag), plus a coat, a camera and an umbrella. This is, of
course, of most use to women but men should take note of the vast size of
handbag that some women carry in addition to other hand luggage. There's
nothing to stop a man sporting a biggish shoulder bag and arguing that it
counts as a handbag should anyone object to it.
Perhaps the only time that you will be prevented from carrying on too much
is if you are travelling on Concorde. The cabin is surprisingly cramped and
there is not much room for hand luggage, so British Airways may insist that
you check in your suitpack. However, your bag will be given the attention
you expect: it is zipped into a clearly labelled cover and the airline
promises that it will be off the jet and into the baggage hall before you
are.
Should you be forced to check in your bags, there are steps you can take to
lessen the chances that they go astray.
The main thing, say the carriers, is to make sure the bags are clearly and
securely labelled - both inside and out. Paper tags are a waste of time as
they can be ripped off, so opt for something more sturdy.
Another tip is to make sure that your home address is not on the outside
label. This is a signal to thieves that the house is probably empty and
therefore a target. However, your home address should be on a label inside
the case so that if it does go astray, it can be returned.
It may seem obvious, but a sturdy lock will slow down a potential thief, as
will a hard suitcase.
Travellers debate the virtues of soft bags versus hard bags, but airlines
are clear that hard-sided cases are safer, as a protection both against
theft and from accidental damage. The downside of this is that they are
heavy before you start filling them up and there are weight restrictions on
checked bags, with the meanest, not surprisingly, being in economy where you
will be limited to 20kg of luggage.
Remember, also, that suitcases and bags look alike and business travellers
in particular are likely to grab the first black Samsonite they see without
necessarily checking to make sure it is theirs.
The airlines advise that you should try to make your bag look different.
That could mean putting a bright strap around the case or using stickers.
One way to avoid losing luggage is to insist on taking direct flights,
wherever and whenever possible. If you do have to change aircraft, your bag
will also need to be switched over, and this is a weak point, although
improvements at London Heathrow should reduce the risk for passengers who
transfer from international BA flights to domestic flights.
If the worst happens and your baggage goes AWOL, you must take immediate
action. Go to the baggage handling services and tell them that your luggage
is missing, and make sure that you fill in the forms. Don't put this off -
you will have all the necessary information to hand and the sooner you alert
the carrier, the sooner you will be reunited with your luggage.
The staff will haggle with you over what you need to buy as replacements and
try to beat you down, assuring you that your bag will undoubtedly turn up on
the next flight. Chances are that it probably will - most bags are delayed
rather than lost - but you still need clean clothes, a change of underwear
and some toiletries. You will do better for compensation if you are on your
outward rather than return journey - the carrier will reckon that you have
all you need at home.
If the missing bag fails to turn up within a reasonable time - ie overnight
 -then you will need to give the airline more detailed information about
what was in it. This is where it pays to have a list with you (among your
hand luggage, of course) of exactly what your suitcase contained. If you
forget to tell them about your expensive leather trousers or silk dress, you
will only kick yourself.
British Airways says that it reunites 95 per cent of lost bags with
passengers within 48 hours. This should get even better as it has recently
joined the airlines' World Tracer scheme, which notifies all lost baggage to
a computer in Atlanta in the US. This matches straying bags to bereft
passengers and automatically puts the case on the next flight.
It is very unlikely you will lose your bag for good - European airlines
mislay about 10 suitcases in 1,000 - but that does not absolve you from
taking basic precautions. And the best thing you can do is insure your
luggage against loss. While the airline which has lost your favourite Louis
Vuitton suitcase will be suitably apologetic, it is ultimately only liable
to pay compensation of Dollars 20 per kilogramme under the Warsaw
Convention.
The moral is: insure your bags, label your bags inside and out, and know
what is inside your bags. Other than that, you are at their mercy.

around the world. But it was not so much the crime as the location - a
lonely monastery 80 miles north of Perth, western Australia - that caught
the public's imagination.
In the accepted cultural order of things, works by Murillo, Pietro da
Cortona and Ribera belong in the shuttered calm of European galleries. It
came as a shock to realise that the greatest such collection in the southern
hemisphere was held by a dwindling band of brothers in the empty sheep
country of western Australia.
But then New Norcia does come as a shock. Driving north on the lonely
highway out of Perth, it rises out of the carpeted green hills like a vision
of Old Spain. Turreted neo-gothic castles in pink and white face an abbey
church whose spire must pine for the Mediterranean.
Along cloisters roofed with corrugated iron, yet possessing the tranquillity
of the Old World, black-cowled monks hurry to Vespers. The older ones
exchange greetings in Spanish. Their day begins at 4.00am - early even by
the rigorous standards of the Australian outback.
The single bell that summoned the brothers to Lauds, first of the seven
canonical hours, calls out across the Victoria plains. Fifteen thousand
acres of it belong to the monastery, although it is farmed by tenants. In
better times it made the community of 30
monks wealthy, but the problems of agriculture have hit devout and pagan
alike.
At least a dozen of the monks are old enough to receive state pensions. This
income funds many of the monastery's day-to-day needs. Providing a retreat
for the stressed urbanite will keep the community afloat in future years. A
new 'hotel' wing has been added. 'The guests will be the focus of our
activities in future years,' said one of the brothers. Visitors are a
double-edged sword, however. Insurance advisers have intimated that in
future an armed guard must watch over the pictures.
The empty white walls where the masterpieces once hung provide a sad
counterpoint to the tale of how the collection, and the community, came into
being. It largely reflects the efforts of one man, Dom Rosendo Salvado. He
was a Spanish-born Benedictine monk. Anxious to perform missionary work, he
persuaded Pope Gregory XVI to send him to Western Australia, where there was
a newly appointed Catholic bishop.
In 1846 Salvado landed in Fremantle. The colony was then 17 years old and
not much of the area beyond Perth and the Swan river valley was settled.
With a flock of monks and supporters, Salvado trekked north. The first
expedition virtually starved to death in the bush, but a second start was
made at the present site five years later.
The oldest wing of the monastery dates from that time but feels older. The
uneven floor planking of local jarrah wood possesses an almost medieval
texture. Contemporaries of Salvado recorded how he found relaxation, on his
hands and knees, polishing the deep brown timber. He was a remarkable man by
every account. Much of the present road south to Perth he cut single-handed
from the bush with an axe.
Salvado's mental gifts made him a sought-after correspondent in European
society of the late 19th century. Letters to Salvado from Queen Isabella of
Spain lie in the archives, as do a series from Florence Nightingale.
One one occasion the abbot was visiting Italy and was presented with a
complete set of uniforms and instruments for a brass band. He sent them back
to Australia ahead of his return.
When Salvado did reach home he was met by Aboriginal boys, rehearsed and
excellently drilled as the New Norcia Brass Band.
Queen Isabella laid the foundation for the art collection, giving New Norcia
an especially fine Murillo in the 1860s. Other monks began to seek out
paintings. As recently as the middle of this century, a Ribera was secured
for Dollars 50 at a Melbourne auction, but most acquisitions were donations.
As the monastery expanded and became more secure, the work of the monks
increased. They sank more than 200 wells in the area, imported bees, planted
vines and founded what were to become four boarding schools catering for
both aboriginal and white children. Each group of students was taught and
administered by a different religious order, although the Benedictines
retained overall control. If ever God had a 'company town', it was New
Norcia 50 years ago.
If the focus of the settlement has now shifted to the visitor, nowhere is
that more evident than at the New Norcia Hotel. Designed in 1927 by Father
Urbano Giminez as a hostel for the visiting parents of pupils, it is one of
the most imposing buildings in the state.
The colonnaded facade, with its deep, cool verandas, opens into a hallway
with a double staircase that would be the equal of a Mayfair or Belgravia
town-house. It is an endearing mixture of the grand and of a run-down
country hotel.

obstacles remain - Emerging destinations / China

<TEXT>
For the past two years China's economy has been growing faster than that of
any other country. Business people are rushing to the country to cash in on
the boom.
The statistics say it all: gross domestic product has been growing at an
annual rate of 8 per cent and reached double-digit figures in 1992. Regions
in the south of the country have been expanding at an even greater rate.
China's transition from rigid state control to a market-oriented system is
bearing fruit for the indigenous population as well as foreigners. Business
travel to and within the country has grown in tandem. and, fortunately,
there have been improvements in the quality of thetravel services available.
Serious infrastructural shortcomings still hinder business travel. Airline
services are perhaps the biggest obstacle. Intrepid travellers who take
domestic flights should not expect to enjoy anything like western standards.
The country's national airline, CAAC, has been decentralised into over 25
regional airlines, practically one per province. Many, however, are very
small operations with only a couple of aircraft.
The largest is Air China, which has done most to upgrade to international
standards. A joint venture company called Ameco Beijing, established between
Lufthansa, the German flag-carrier, and Air China, undertakes aircraft
maintenance and servicing. and has brought this particular airline to the
vanguard of Chinese aviation.
MD80 and B737 aircraft are utilised heavily for inter-city routes but there
are also more passenger-friendly B737-300 and B767s in its fleet.
On the ground, Beijing airport is less of a nightmare to fly into these
days. In 1992 an extension to the terminal was opened, which eased
congestion. By 1996 a new terminal will open.
A six-lane highway downtown from Beijing airport has also helped cut the
journey time of 45 minutes by about two-thirds. The 120km speed limit also
helps. But one thing has not changed, and that is the inability to rent a
car.
Many taxis have meters but most drivers do not speak English, so it is wise
to get directions written down.
The shortage of good office and overnight accommodation in China's capital
city is no longer so acute, however. For many years, visitors to Beijing
could choose only from the Great Wall Sheraton, the Shangri-La Beijing
(located a little too far out of town) and the Holiday Inn Lido, which is
towards the airport. The Holiday Inn's adjoining apartment/office block was
a Who's Who of the foreign business community. These stood out as beacons of
western comfort.
Over the last few years, however, there has been an explosion of new,
western-managed hotels and the choice is almost limitless. Appalling traffic
congestion in the city dictates that you must choose where to stay with
care; otherwise, taxi fares become exorbitant and you will not makethe best
use of your time in the city.
All rooms have what you would expect in a European establishment: colour TV
with satellite programmes and in-house movies, direct dial phones, air
conditioning, minibars and PC and fax outlets.
The SAS Royal has opened near the Holiday Inn, and both are adjacent to the
China International exhibition centre. Go for the spacious Royal club rooms
on its executive floor.
Slightly closer to the centre is the Great Wall Sheraton - nearest to the
embassy district - which has new neighbours in the shape of the Landmark,
Hilton and Kempinski hotels. The latter is a mixed use complex with offices,
apartments, endless restaurants and shops (including a Munich-style brewery)
as well as useful services for expatriates such as a bakery and
delicatessen. It also offers a shuttle bus to downtown.
Closer in still is the Swissotel, part of the Hong Kong Macau Centre.
Upgrade to junior suites for good-size bathrooms. To the east is the New
World, another mini city-style operation with offices, shops and apartments.
Directly south are two Shangri-La managed hotels, the three-star Traders and
the five-star China World, together with over 20 restaurants, airline
offices, exhibition space, two office towers, apartments and endless shops.
Trade up to China World's Horizon floor if the budget allows.
In the core of the city are two deluxe properties directly east of the
Imperial Palace and Tiananmen Square: the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza and the
Palace.
Without doubt, the Palace is Beijing's finest, complete with a white marble
staircase that would not be out of place in Hong Kong. Not surprisingly, it
is managed by the Hong Kong based Peninsula group.
Other hotels worth mentioning are the New Otani and the four-star Sara.
Not everybody stays in Beijing, however. It is likely that you will be
travelling to the south of the country because this region, more than
anywhere else, has benefited from Deng Xiaoping's reforms. Deng's 'open
door' policy, adopted in 1978, manifested itself in a list of Special
Economic Zones set up for foreign investors. The Guangdong province and the
Shenzen economic zone were the principal beneficiaries initially, followed
by Pudong in 1980.
Over the past 15 years, Guangzhou's economy has grown at an annual average
rate of 13.9 per cent. During 1993 and 1994 it rocketed to 23 per cent.
Travellers here can opt for one of the two rather large (over 1,000-room)
hotels, the Garden of China, the much smaller Holiday Inn in the new
commercial district or the Ramada Pearl, which is the closest to the Huangpu
development zone. The city's Baiyun airport is just 20 minutes away.
A visit to Shanghai, the country's financial centre, may be on your
schedule. There are half a dozen good, western standard hotels to choose
from. The best is probably the Portman Shangri-La but the Garden hotel
(managed by Okura) is a close second. There is also the Shanghai Hilton, the
Equatorial, JC Mandarin, Sheraton, New World and Westin Tai Ping Yang.
Traffic is appalling in this major port; the airport is 14km away and queues
for taxis are usually horrendous.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (17): Chaos of the modernisation
drive - Emerging destinations / Vietnam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH MURRAY

<TEXT>
The fun starts on the way in from the airport. Speeding along in a Toyota
taxi, the four-lane highway to the centre of Hanoi that was completed
earlier this year looks impressive - until the car screeches to a halt at a
junction with no traffic lights, where a farmer is endeavouring to cross
accompanied by a gaggle of geese.
Such an episode is typical of the chaotic way Vietnam is running headlong
for high-tech 20th century modernism and can make business travel there both
frustrating and extremely entertaining.
In the hotel, you may have a new Japanese television set in your room,
complete with remote control, only to find that the establishment has not
bought itself a satellite dish and the only programme available on all 20
channels is a Vietnamese soap opera, seen through constant grey electronic
haze.
However, with investment pouring into the country - foreign pledges for
projects in Vietnam recently hit the Dollars 10bn mark, according to the
State Committee for Co-operation and Investment - it is clear that business
travellers are not being put off by such details.
Every flight into Vietnam is packed with foreign executives eager to strike
a deal. The creaking infrastructure is sometimes unable to cope. Flights
between Hanoi, the capital, and Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), the
commercial capital, and centres such as Hong Kong or Bangkok are often
overbooked. Power cuts make using computers a trying affair and the roads
are in a pitiful state.
Finding a hotel can be a problem, too. Ho Chi Minh City has a good choice of
accommodation. Older establishments such as the Continental, Majestic and
the Rex will suit those looking for charm and history. The more expensive
Omni Saigon, the Saigon Floating Hotel and the Century Saigon provide modern
international facilities.
In Hanoi, however, the existing accommodation can barely keep up with the
rush. The Metropole remains the only western standard hotel and as a result
is constantly fully booked. While the mini-hotels springing up all over the
city are easing the situation, finding somewhere to stay in the capital can
be difficult, so book well in advance.
But the Vietnamese are no slouches when it comes to accommodating this
influx of business travellers. In the two main cities, taxis can now be
called by phone and a variety of consultants and agencies will make travel
arrangements and extend visas.
Most hotels are busily installing IDD phone and fax lines while in Hanoi the
Little Italian restaurant will take telephone orders and even deliver its
pizzas to your door.
The cyclos - bicycle taxis - have also started to smarten up their act by
adding to their vehicles hoods, as protection against the frequent monsoon
rainstorms, and cushions.
A powerful incentive behind the creation of these services is the dual
pricing system, a particularly frustrating element of travel in the country.
The system - whereby foreigners are charged substantially more than the
local population - operates on both an official and an unofficial level.
The government-imposed pricing system ensures that a foreigner pays, for
example, Dollars 300 for a return flight to Ho Chi Minh City while a
Vietnamese pays Dollars 118 for the same journey. Foreign residents pay
higher prices for their electricity and phone bills, too.
On the unofficial market, prices can usually be knocked down by about half.
Nevertheless, while a cyclo driver can be persuaded to drop his charge
considerably, he will never go below a certain price - about Dollars 1 a
kilometre (25 cents for Vietnamese).
Such frustrations aside, linguists will find the country a delight. The
Vietnamese speak a wide range of languages, many of them acquired during
periods spent working or studying in China, Cuba or countries of the former
Soviet Union. Thus, it is not unusual, for example, to find a Vietnamese who
speaks fluent Romanian. Fortunately for those whose Romanian is a little
rusty, English is rapidly becoming the most popular foreign language spoken
in the country, with French as the runner-up.
Foreign investment is increasing the comfort for the business traveller.
Cathay Pacific's involvement on the Hong Kong-Hanoi flight, for example, has
helped well-trained air hostesses dish out meals that almost resemble
something served on British Airways or Lufthansa - a far cry from the
dog-eared cardboard box containing shrivelled vegetables in vinegar and a
stale bun that used to be the norm on Vietnamese flights a few years ago.
Over recent years several foreign firms have been working with the
Directorate General of Posts and Telecommunications, which runs Vietnam's
communications, to upgrade the country's internal and overseas
telecommunications. While national phone lines remain unreliable, it is
claimed that international direct dialing now reaches 214 countries with
efficiency. However, this comes at a price. Vietnam is one of the most
expensive countries in the world for IDD calls.
Credit cards, unheard of a couple of years ago, are being accepted in more
and more places. It is also possible to draw cash from certain banks, such
as the ANZ Bank in Hanoi, using a credit card.
The easiest method of payment up to now, has been with dollars in cash.
Dollars have been interchangeable with dong, the local currency for most
transactions, and government economists estimate Dollars 600m is circulating
in notes within the country.
However, a new foreign exchange regime introduced at the beginning of this
month is set to change all this. The new rules mean businesses must channel
their hard currency earnings through bank accounts. Everyday transactions
must be carried out in dong, although it is uncertain how effectively this
rule will be enforced.
Airlines, insurance, shipping and telecommunications firms may continue to
charge in dollars, but the full consequences of this move remain to be seen.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (14): Avoid the stress - relax and
enjoy it - Emerging destinations / Latin America
</HEADLINE>

'Don't eat the fried chicken at Lima airport.'
Seasoned travellers to Latin America are full of anecdotal advice such as
this. Everyone who has been to the continent has at least one harrowing tale
of 'Montezuma's Revenge'; of taxi touts quick to spot a naive foreigner
unaware of the latest currency reform, knocking several digits off; or of a
bureaucrat showing abnormal levels of zeal in performing an otherwise simple
task.
The most important piece of advice to any traveller - business or otherwise
 -is: relax. Adopt a Zen-style approach to the whole experience, and it will
be more rewarding, enjoyable and, ultimately, successful than might be
imagined at first sight. The alternative - becoming stressed - will
certainly do neither you, nor your mission, any good at all.
Business travel to Latin America is as yet in its infancy, but it is rapidly
developing, in the wake of the hundreds of privatisations that have taken
place across the region. That means that many aspects of travel to the
continent do not match developed world conditions, though anyone who has
experienced travel in some parts of the former Soviet Union will find Latin
America positively advanced.
All generalisations disguise many local variations, of course, but there are
certain unifying aspects to travel in Latin America. Those who have already
sampled Lima airport's fried chicken may find much of what follows old hat;
novices may find it useful.
Language: Speaking Spanish - or Portuguese, in the case of Brazil - is
naturally a particular advantage, though not an absolute necessity in the
case of those with a grasp of English, as English is much more widely
understood and used, certainly in a business context, where many top-notch
personnel will have spent a period of study in the US. But even a smattering
of Spanish (or Portuguese) will be received with great pleasure; Latin
Americans are, on the whole, not language snobs, and greatly appreciate
foreigners' attempts to speak their language.
Security: Some cities, such as Buenos Aires, are astonishingly safe. Others
 -including Lima and Rio de Janeiro - can be problematic for the unwary. But
physical violence is extremely rare; theft of ostentatiously valuable
objects and cash is the main aim of any unfriendly confrontation. Obvious
rules apply; when in unfamiliar surroundings, carry minimum necessities, and
never try to be heroic. While violence is rare, life is cheap, on occasion.
Always carry a little money, since that will at least placate the robber.
Avoid illegal drugs; most countries, even when renowned drug-exporters
themselves, have very strict anti-drug laws. (See Health, below). UK-based
travellers can call the Foreign Office Travel Advice Unit on weekdays
between 9.30-4 for the latest information on destinations around the globe,
including Latin America. However, that requires persistence as the lines are
frequently engaged. But on the whole, the continent's trouble spots have
considerably calmed in the last couple of years.
Accommodation: Latin America is not overflowing with first-class hotels.
Years of economic decline and political unrest have meant that little
investment has, until recently, been channelled into a sector which hosted
declining numbers of visitors. You can expect to pay developed world prices
for what often feels like developing world accommodation and service.
This is changing. US hotel groups in particular are fast expanding in the
region, though some very important cities, such as Caracas, still lack a
truly first-class hotel. Others, such as Buenos Aires, have a highly
developed hotel sector, but you will be fortunate to find anything with all
the comforts and services you require on a business trip for less than
Dollars 200 a night.
Some exotic-sounding locations - Montevideo, for example - still have
primitive hotel accommodation, though fancy prices. Yet just up the road
from Montevideo, at Punta del Este, are some fine hotels and the best
beaches in the continent.
Internal travel: Some internal airlines, generally those still in state
hands, are now widely regarded as lacking perfect safety standards. While
this area is clouded in controversy, it is best to check with the aviation
authority of one's own country for a view about which airlines are viewed as
maintaining all the safety measures required.
The continent's rail network is sadly underdeveloped; buses are widely used
and generally reliable, the taxi of course is ubiquitous. Hire cars are
widely available but again, at developed-world rates and, in my experience,
highly unreliable. Opt for taxis for city travel; most locally-based
companies will be able to provide a chauffeur-driven car to help minimise
hassles. Remember that the continent is a vast area; Argentina is
geographically the same size as India.
Health: Despite the opening comment from a traveller who has spent the last
decade shuttling between the UK and the continent, seriously debilitating
problems are very rare. The usual, obvious things apply as with any
developing region: consider avoiding salads and fruit you do not peel
yourself, stick to bottled water, eat food which is simple, bland and
well-cooked. Some visitors regard the region's (highly variable) cuisine as
delightful, others differ. Caracas, for example, might be a nightmare to get
around in by car; but its restaurants are plentiful and excellent. In high
altitude places such as Bolivia, consider chewing coca-leaf (not illegal
from street vendors in small quantities) - it does help ease altitude
sickness.
Currency: Most Latin American countries - Brazil is an exception - have
reined-in the rampant inflation of the 1980s, though whether it is simply a
case of having trapped the devil in a jam-jar is yet to be seen. Stable, if
occasionally over-valued, local exchange rates now generally prevail. In any
case, the US dollar is the universal mechanism of exchange; take traveller's
cheques for safety, of course. All major credit cards - and thousands of
others - are widely accepted.
Guides: Bookshops are now jammed solid with guides to the region, but only
one is imperative, despite its occasionally infuriating tendency to lag
behind recent developments. The book is the South American Handbook,
published by Trade and Travel Publications. Potted histories, maps, hotel
lists, advice are all there. Don't expect its price guides to be too
accurate however; this is still a region of some volatility.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (15): Airlines and hotels can
count the beans - Emerging destinations / South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most tired cliche in South Africa is that the country is enjoying a
post-election honeymoon period. As far as the business community goes, it is
a phrase of some substance. Political reform in South Africa has ushered in
an era of enthusiastic courtship between foreign businessmen, investors and
bankers, and the local business community.
But while there has been much holding of hands, and some knots have been
tied, it remains early days. There has been little inward flow of investment
to talk of.
For airlines and hotels, though, it is not too early to count the beans. The
runway at Jan Smuts airport in Johannesburg testifies to a forest of new
visitors. The foyers of the larger hotels have a cosmopolitan buzz which was
absent as recently as a year ago.
For those businessmen who have still to put their toe in South African
waters, there is not too much to be concerned about. Perhaps the country's
biggest disadvantage is that it is a long-haul destination, certainly so far
as any other major business capital is concerned.
On the other hand, this is offset, at least for European visitors, by the
fact that there is little time difference. With most flights overnight, it
is also quite possible to leave at the end of one business day and do
business in South Africa the following morning (and vice versa).
Most of the world's main carriers fly into South Africa on a fairly frequent
basis, with British Airways and South African Airways both offering daily
flights, and more, from London.
If anything, there are indications that supply might not yet have caught up
with demand. Regular visitors from the UK say that business and first class
are normally very heavily booked, and it is not always possible, at short
notice, to get on a flight.
On arrival, the visitor will discover that South Africa's best face is not
immediately obvious. Jan Smuts airport, which is currently being upgraded,
provides a satisfactory, rather than a good, service. Immigration and
baggage services are adequate, rather than accomplished.
For the purposes of getting around, public transport is a non-issue - at
least so far as getting to the places that businessmen are interested in.
This leaves the option of taxis, hire cars or a chauffeur service. Taxis are
available but not always reliable, and the cars tend to be a bit run down.
The hire car fleet is in good shape, roads are excellent, and the geography
is very manageable, so hiring a car is a feasible choice. First prize,
though, is to have a chauffeur service, because this means you do not have
to worry about parking.
When it comes to accommodation, mainstream hotels range from Pounds 40 to
Pounds 110 a night. So far as Johannesburg goes - and it is the nub of most
business visits, though Cape Town also attracts a fair share of visitors -
the Sandton Sun and Towers hotel is a firm favourite. Bankers and
businessmen can enjoy the bracing frisson of rubbing shoulders with the
competition in the foyer.
The Towers extension, opened in 1993, is arguably the hotel best adapted to
the business visitor, offering such facilities as chauffeured limousines,
cellular phones and a business centre. Unsurprisingly, it also comes at the
top of the price range.
One regular English visitor says the hotel is 'a notch off top quality', but
offers good value in an international sense. He adds: 'I would be happy to
transport that hotel elsewhere.'
There are, off course, many other options. The Rosebank hotel is a
middle-of-the-road favourite in the suburbs, while the Carlton keeps the
flag burning in town. While there is no gainsaying the trend towards staying
in the suburbs, the Carlton clearly makes more sense for businessmen
visiting banks, mining houses, stockbrokers and lawyers, all of whom still
tend to be concentrated in the central business district.
The concern likely to be most to the fore in the mind of the novice visitor
is safety. The good news is that levels of political violence have fallen
dramatically since the elections. The bad news is that there is still a lot
of crime, much of it violent.
That said, visitors are likely to be pleasantly surprised. Mr Tony Hicks,
chief executive of the UK-Southern Africa Business Association, and a
frequent visitor, comments: 'Crime is a bigger issue in the minds of
newcomers to the region than it should be. It is a very safe country to be
in. A businessman is absolutely safe, providing he is sensible.'
A US bankers notes: 'Central Johannesburg is worse than mid-town Manhattan,
but no worse than the bad parts of downtown Manhattan.' A UK compatriot
adds: 'I don't feel any more exposed than I would in parts of Los Angeles,
Chicago or Detroit.'
The actual conduct of business ought not to be too difficult. For a start,
after years of isolation, South Africa tends to welcome visitors. English is
the language of business, telephone and fax services are good (cellular
phone services were recently introduced) and there is competent professional
back-up in areas such as law and accountancy.
For the businessmen with a few days to kill, there is a surfeit of leisure
opportunities. The jewel in the crown is probably Cape Town, a two-hour
flight from Johannesburg, and the surrounding western Cape region. Try to
visit the game parks in the Eastern Transvaal, five to six hours by car, but
shorter if you fly.
If you are pressed for time or like golf, nip off to the Sun City complex,
two hours' drive from Johannesburg.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (13): The customer is in the
driving seat - Christopher Price explains how the car rental price war plays
into travellers' hands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business travellers are firmly in the driving seat. A price war in the
recession-hit car rental industry has been further compounded by an
intensifying of competition with the entry of new operators. The result has
been falling rates to historic relative lows as more companies have chased
fewer customers.
Most of the discounting has been felt at the leisure end of the market, with
some rental companies operating at a loss in order to retain market share.
But, increasingly, business users - who comprise 60 per cent of the total
rental market - are benefiting. 'As contracts come up for renewal,
businesses are increasingly reading about the price war in the car rental
market and want a share of it,' says the managing director of one big rental
group. 'We are having to respond.'
A survey by the Association for Car Rental Industry Systems Standards
(Acriss) of the big five European car rental markets - the UK, Spain,
France, Germany and Italy - showed a decline in real terms last year by
nearly 10 per cent to Dollars 3.86bn. Volumes fell 5.9 per cent.
Germany was the worst hit, its rental market value declining 14.5 per cent
between 1992 to 1993 to Dollars 1.9bn. Spain slid 6.6 per cent to Dollars
282.3m, while the UK managed a rise of 2.4 per cent to Pounds 806.1m.
Germany, which accounts for 49 per cent of the market share of the five
countries, is traditionally the largest car rental market. This is due to
the legal requirement that, when a vehicle is damaged in an accident, a
replacement car must be provided.
At the same time, the dominance of the 'big five' operators - Europcar,
Avis, Budget, Hertz and Eurodollar - is increasingly been challenged by
Alamo, the big US rental group, which is striving to become a Europe-wide
operator, and the rapid growth of rental brokers, such as Holiday Autos and
Suncars.
Brokers, which match renters with hirers and, because they do not own fleets
themselves, do not have the high start-up costs of operators, increased
rental days sold by 26.4 per cent last year. In the leisure market, the
brokers have significantly undercut established short-period car hire rates
and the vicious price war in the holiday market has been widely laid at
their door. Their large-scale entry into the business market is seen as only
a matter of time.
The big rental groups are also under pressure from the manufacturers,
particularly in the US, which have had to re-evaluate their positions during
the recession. Many of the rental groups have special relationships with the
big producers involving fleet discounts and maintenance. Overtures from
Japanese manufacturers are expected to be listened to with increasing
interest.
Such has been the decline in hire rates in the UK that Acriss says it is now
as cheap to rent a new car as to buy. According to the association, 'one can
now rent a car every weekend of the year and also for a two-week period in
the summer for a combined cost of less than the annual ownership cost of
Pounds 5,188.' The latter is the Automobile Association figure.
Of the major European cities, London is the fourth cheapest, according to a
survey by Visa. The daily rate for a mid-range car was Pounds 56.50.
Amsterdam was the cheapest at Pounds 47.70. Brussels was the most expensive
at Pounds 132.40. Frankfurt came in at the equivalent of Pounds 50.97, Milan
at Pounds 92.28, Barcelona at Pounds 63.41 and Paris at Pounds 79.78.
With margins under pressure, the big players are fighting hard for market
share, with the result being that some are operating at a loss. 'A price war
may sound like good news for travellers, but in the medium term rates will
have to rise if the industry is to invest in the service side of the
business,' says Mr Malcolm Packer, managing director at Eurodollar's
international operations. 'Some sense of sanity must return to the
industry.'
He fears that lower revenues will lead to lower quality and deliver less of
what business travellers want and need. 'A businessman wants to arrive at
his airport in the knowledge that there will be no queues, little paperwork
and good onward directions. It all has to be as painless as possible.'
The Acriss survey suggests that, with Europe's economy slowly pulling out of
recession, the rental market may have bottomed out. Only Germany is forecast
to see a further decline in its revenues this year, down 0.25 per cent.
Spain is forecast to grow 12.88 per cent, France 4.61 per cent, Italy 4.96
per cent and the UK 3.41 per cent. Market volumes are forecast to grow
nearly 7 per cent.
Acriss is also forecasting a growing presence for the computer reservation
systems (CRS) being increasingly used by airlines, hotels and car rental
companies. Their growth is likely to underpin any recovery in the fortunes
of the major rental groups, which are tied into the main CRS systems -
Amadeus, Galileo, Sabre and Worldspan. Last year, they received over 20 per
cent of their business through the CRS system. The number of CRS terminals
grew by 1 per cent last year to 54,348, according to Acriss.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (12): Unfamiliar dangers - Tips on
personal safety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH WILKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may even be true that you have nearly as good a chance of being mugged in
Maida Vale, London, as anywhere else in the world. But a businessman abroad
is almost certainly less likely to spot the warning signs than one who is
confronted by a robber on his home teritory.
In unfamiliar cities business travellers are at their most vulnerable at the
point of arrival: the airport. This is where you can fall foul of unlicensed
or unscrupulous taxi drivers, who will rip you off because you have not done
your homework and found out three vital pieces of information: what is the
best mode of transport downtown, the distance and the average fare. The
airport is also where your wallet or handbag can get lifted while potential
vendors crowd around you to win your fare to your hotel.
The first rule of foreign business travel is to get advice on which taxi
company or taxi type is best to patronise. If you don't know the city, your
agent, sales rep or even staff at the hotel you have booked into can advise
you.
While at airports, the time spent at check-in desks can also be dangerous.
Again, the combination of crowds and the constant movement of luggage and
endless distractions should put all travellers on their guard. The best
advice is to spend as little time as possible on this stage.
The move towards non-desk check-in at airports is to be applauded for this
reason. Lining up at the terminal counter could soon become a thing of the
past and it will also negate the need to have to drag your luggage through
the terminal. KLM is one of the airlines in the forefront of this trend. It
offers seven options for those passengers departing Amsterdam: through
check-in, round-trip check-in, car park check-in, gate check-in, telephone
and fax check-in and ticket office check-in.
Telephone check-in is perhaps the most popular service that airlines offer.
Scandinavian airline SAS reckons that business travellers need only queue
for 10 seconds at the airport for their boarding pass. At least that reduces
the time a mugger or robber can prey on you. Ask your airline whether it
offers such a service, or whether it offers checking in at a downtown hotel
or rail station.
The danger does not end once you get downtown, however. Hotels can provide
rich pickings for unsavoury types. Always take advice from the hotel
concierge about the city's no-go areas before you venture out for some fresh
air.
Of course, there are some countries in the world where the traveller is
perfectly safe. Singapore is virtually crime-free and South Korea needs only
commonsense discretion. The dangers are much greater in Cambodia, the
Commonwealth of Independent States (the former Soviet Union) and Colombia,
Iran, Iraq, the Somali border in Kenya, the Iraqi border in Kuwait, in rural
areas of the Philippines, in north Somalia, south-east Turkey, former
Yugoslavia and Zaire. To generalise, it is in the Middle East and Latin
America that there have been the most attacks on business people.
In these danger zones being prepared is the secret. Caution must be
exercised when using internal transport. You must vary your route home and
avoid visits on public holidays which are often key terrorist dates. Do not
use the company jet, which sits on the tarmac for everyone to see. If
travelling in a group, split up between cabins and don't book into your
hotel under a corporate name unless the danger is minimal (and the corporate
rate too good to miss).
Some nation- alities are more likely to become victims than others. It is
not surpris- ing to learn that Americans come top of the list, but Britons
and Canadians come close behind since they can often be mistaken for them.
The Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) advises in these matters and
has a check-list for ensuring safety. It suggests, among other things,
making two photocopies of the important pages of your passport (one to pack,
the other to leave at home) which will expedite replacement. You are advised
not to pack unmarked prescription drugs and political literature. Choose
non-stop flights or flights with the fewest intermediate stops or
connections and reserve a seat near the exit.
They also advise dressing like a tourist and not a wealthy businessperson.
Leave status symbols (watches and other jewellery) behind and do not discuss
your travel plans with strangers.
Greater security is afforded on hotel executive floors which have better
staff levels and often separate entrances, with generally more privacy. And
never use the Please Clean My Room sign on your door as it shows your room
is empty.
Lastly, people who walk with confidence and a sense of purpose rarely get
mugged, say the OSAC.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (11): Before the high-tech
shoulder bag bursts / A look at a bewildering array of gadgets from laptops
to modems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The business traveller in the 1990s faces a bewildering array of electronic
wizardry designed to boost personal productivity, collect, store or transmit
information or simply to entertain.
Thanks to advances in technology, particularly silicon integration, many
travelling business executives now carry a bulging shoulder-bag of high-tech
gadgets, including a notebook PC, fax-modem and perhaps even a digital
cellular telephone.
Add to this a pocket-sized electronic diary/organiser which will, if
required, interface with the portable PC, a compact 35mm zoom camera and
portable mini-disc or CD player for entertainment and the collection of
electronic gadgetry is almost complete.
The popularity of lightweight 'notebook' portable computers in particular
highlights the strides made by technology in recent years. It is less than
15 years since the first desktop computers began arriving in offices, and
yet today PC manufacturers can pack most, if not all, of the processing
power of an early super-computer into an A4-size package weighing around six
pounds.
Low-power chips, together with improvements in screen and battery
technology, have enabled engineers to build machines with brighter colour
displays and longer battery lives. These improvements, coupled with tumbling
prices, have turned the notebook computer into the fastest-growing segment
of the world computer market.
Last year in Europe alone, end-users spent Dollars 3.6bn on portable
computers - mostly notebook or even smaller sub-notebook machines -
according to Dataquest, the market research organisation. Unit sales of
notebook PCs alone grew by over 18 per cent to 1.33m with four vendors -
Compaq, Toshiba, IBM and Apple - accounting for more than half the total
market.
Two years ago, a typical mono notebook with an Intel 386 processor, 2Mb of
Ram and a 60Mb hard disk cost about Pounds 2,000 in the UK. Now, a much more
powerful machine based on an Intel 486 processor with 4Mb of Ram, a 210Mb
hard disk, PCMIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association)
card slots for add-on peripherals, a dual-scan colour screen and a
tracker-ball for mouse-style pointing under Microsoft Windows can be bought
for under Pounds 1,500.
Some manufacturers have developed specific machines for niche applications.
For example, Toshiba offers a machine which includes a CD-Rom drive, stereo
speakers, detachable keyboard and other facilities to make multimedia
presentations while travelling. For those who require paper print-outs but
do not want to lug around a separate printer, Canon has developed machines
which incorporate a bubble jet printer.
For serious portable computer users a modem (modulator/de-modulator) is
another essential piece of kit to be packed alongside the spare battery
pack, the power adapter and connecting cables. A modem enables a computer to
exchange digital data over an older-style analogue telephone line with
another machine, typically a head-office computer which is also equipped
with a modem.
A modem link typically enables a travelling executive, salesman or engineer
to exchange data such as sales or product information or customer details
with the office network, send electronic mail or capture information from a
commercial database. Using a modem link, a traveller can even look up
airline flight details and make or change reservations on one of the airline
computer databases.
Modems come in a variety of forms and are getting faster, smarter and
cheaper. Some, based usually on proprietary designs, fit inside the machine
but external devices - including some which fit into PCMCIA card slots -
usually offer faster transmission speeds together with sophisticated data
compression and error correction features.
The current business standard is for data transmission at 14,400bps (also
known as V32bis) coupled with V42 error correction and V42bis data
compression which allow even higher transmission speeds. Most also provide
the facility to send and receive faxes direct from the screen.
Currently most portable modems, including PCMCIA card modems, are designed
to be plugged into a telephone wall telephone socket. However, some niche
products are available to cope with special situations - for example, the
public call box or the hotel telephone which does not unplug from the wall.
In addition, wireless modems have begun to appear which are designed either
to work with existing analogue cellular mobile telephone services or with
the new breed of dedicated digital mobile packet-switched data networks.
These devices represent the ultimate in portability since they will allow
mobile computer users to transmit or receive data and faxes from virtually
anywhere.
Eventually, however, there may be no need for modems at all since, at least
in theory, it should be possible to plug a digital device, including
portable computers, directly into the next generation of mobile telephones
operating on digital cellular networks. Over the past few years the advent
of digital cellular technology has spawned a second generation of cellular
networks throughout Europe and elsewhere.
In Europe and other areas of the world which have adopted the GSM digital
cellular standard, these new networks offer other advantages for business
travellers. GSM networks offer more secure and clearer voice communications.
Perhaps even more importantly, because they are based on a common standard,
once so-called 'roaming agreements' are signed between network operators,
travellers will be able to use the same telephone anywhere where there is a
GSM system. Potentially, that means that for the first time it will be
possible to drive from one end of Europe using the same pocket-sized handset
 -and be available on the same telephone number.
Although the uptake of these new GSM services has been relatively slow in
the UK, where the analogue networks are well-established and provide
superior coverage, elsewhere in Europe, especially in Germany, GSM services
have grown rapidly.
By the end of the decade even more ambitious cellular telephone systems
based on new telecommunications satellite technology will usher in the truly
global mobile telephone which will be capable of being used literally
anywhere on earth. Plans for multi-billion dollar global satellite mobile
communications systems such as Iridium, Globalstar and Inmarsat-P are
already well advanced and on target to launch services beginning in 1998.
Most of them are based on a new breed of low-earth orbit (Leo) satellites
which operate at altitudes of 400 to 1,000 miles. Because they are closer to
earth than traditional Geo-stationary satellites, Leo-based systems will
work with less powerful, smaller, lighter and cheaper equipment.
Most strategists believe that these new services, coupled with the continued
convergence of telephone and computer technologies, will eventually lead to
multi-purpose handheld digital devices which will combine the functions of
voice and data telecommunications.
Sales of the first generation of so-called personal digital assistants, such
as Apple's Newton, have failed to live up to expectations, largely because
they lack sophisticated wireless telecommunications facilities. However
second generation devices which combine the data-processing features of a
hand-held computer and the convenience of the electronic organiser with
wireless voice and data telecommunications features should be available in a
few years' time.
Such devices could provide a full range of information, navigation,
communications and entertainment services in a pocket-sized package. Perhaps
then the shoulder bag stuffed full of high-tech goodies will look as
out-of-place as a portable typewriter does at an airport departure lounge
today.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (10): In Tokyo, do not open the
taxi door - Christine Buckley offers advice on what may be your first
encounter in a foreign land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chances are that your first encounter in a foreign land will be with a
taxi driver.
The taxi ride from an airport is an important introduction to a country.
Your impressions start here.
The buzz of New York can begin with a chatty and helpful ex-boxer from
Brooklyn, who wants to know all about London. But then, as he gathers that
you're a complete newcomer, he may charge over the odds fourfold for a
journey in a car which he has falsely assured you is a bona fide yellow cab
in all but colour.
Southern Turkey can seem even more laid back than one might expect if your
driver just can't be bothered with basic traffic regulations such as red
lights and has a similar disregard for sobriety.
As one might expect, in standard, service and customs, taxis are as varied
as the cities that they operate in. It is always a good idea to stick with
the main licensed firm. While all independent companies do not deserve the
sweeping suspicion they meet with, a stranger to a city cannot hope quickly
to deter- mine the good from the bad.
The flagship of the taxi world, if such a thing is technically possible, is
generally held to be London. With the requirement that drivers have 'the
knowledge' of the capital's streets, its standard of training is unsur-
passed. The black cabs are plentiful and convenient, as they can be hailed
easily in most central locations. They are also reliable and built for
maximum efficiency in a city which has developed around historic streets
that would have challenged the old horse power. The adage that London taxis
can turn on a sixpence is not misplaced.
But standards do not come cheaply. During the day, the meter will clock up a
flag fee of Pounds 1 as you get in, which will take you just 504 yards.
After that, it is 20p for the next 282 yards or 57 seconds and thereafter it
is 20p for each 180 yards. Additional passengers make for a 30p charge.
In some cities, taxi fares seem so high they come close to taking flight.
Rates in Zurich begin at a start-up charge of SFr6 (Pounds 3) and proceed at
SFr2.90 for each kilometre and an additional SFr1 each minute of waiting.
Zurich cabs cannot be hailed in the street; they are picked up at ranks or
by telephone when they, virtually without fail, will respond within 10
minutes.
In Tokyo, one will need both a reasonable amount of cash - although that is
not a surprise for a Japanese city - and also a map. Tokyo's taxi drivers
are not the world's best navigators and it is advisable for passengers to
know how to reach their destinations. The drivers are, however, polite and
will always open the door for you via an in-car lever. In fact, it is bad
manners for the passenger to open the door.
The minimum fare is Y600 (Pounds 3.87); an average 20-minute journey will
clock up a Y1,500-2,000 charge.
Brussels also claims a place in the expensive stakes, although service is
included, with tips incorporated in the meter charging. A passenger parts
with BFr95 (Pounds 1.89) for just getting in the cab and then BFr38 for each
kilometre after that. Again hailing is not generally practised but ranks are
ample.
If style is what you seek in a taxi then, true to form, Paris is the place
to find it. Mercedes and top-of-the range Citroens are de rigueur. The
daytime kilometre charge is FFr3.23 (39p) but in very slow traffic or when
the taxi is waiting, the charge is based on FFr120 per hour. Try to have the
right change or you are likely to experience Gallic irritability.
Almost as symbolic of the taxi as the London's black cab is New York's
yellow one. The streets of Manhattan are awash with yellow and the air is
full of horn-blowing. New York cabs are fast and frenetic. Not for nothing
do they often have handles on the ceiling above the back seat - you may need
to cling on.
The grid street pattern of New York is easy to navigate but often taxi
drivers are new to the city and can need good directions. Yellow cabs are
cheap - Dollars 1.50 (Pounds 1) flat rate and 25 cents for each half mile
thereafter.
You cannot get a cab at Toronto airport - not officially anyway. As the
airport is in the neighbouring city of Mississauga, Toronto taxis are not
allowed to pick up there. Apart from the airbus, the only transport is
provided by very expensive limousines which charge CDollars 36 (Pounds 17)
for the trip downtown.
But a trick to avoid this is to go to the departures level and catch a cab
that is depositing travellers. It is likely to take you, but you have to be
quick as the cabs are frightened of the police patrols. Toronto taxis charge
a flag fee of CDollars 2.20, then CDollars 1 per kilometre. The average trip
around the downtown area is CDollars 4-9.
Bonn taxis tend to be efficient and in reasonable supply. It will cost you
DM3.40 (Pounds 1.40) to get in the car; the first kilometre is charged at
DM4 and then it becomes cheaper. An average 4-6km journey would be charged
at an average DM1.80 a kilometre. You can rely on the driver being fit. As
public service employees, they are required to have health certificates.
Taking a taxi in Sydney is a laid-back affair. Invariably, you will sit next
to the driver and the general approach of cab companies is largely
uncommercial. The drivers are also prone to do something that would severely
raise the blood pressure of most taxi drivers - that is rounding down the
fare if the passenger has not got the correct change.
The cost is moderate with fares made up of a ADollars 1.85 (87p) hiring
charge; mileage of 97 cents per kilometre; and waiting time of ADollars
27.90 per hour.
One should not misread the unceremonious outward appearance of Sydney taxis
for casualness. Among other things, the New South Wales Taxi Council is very
proud of the fact that it sold its training programme to London.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (9): The space that they deserve -
Daniel Green investigates the trend to bigger air seat sizes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business class air travellers have always been coveted by airlines. The
seats in which they sit are usually large and, though the number of
passengers that can be carried is thus reduced, the premium prices they pay
 -up to seven times the price of an economy class seat - more than makes up
for that.
The extra cost may be worth it. Large seats help business travellers arrive
at their destinations able to work rather than in need of a day to recover
on the beach.
But until now, the advantages of space have been largely reserved for
long-haul passengers. Most people travelling within Europe have found
themselves crammed into exactly the same size of seat as economy passengers.
It leaves them struggling for elbow space to use their personal computers or
read a newspaper.
Things are changing, and not before time. In recent years, airlines have
feted the long- haul business class traveller. Their inducements to fly have
mostly taken the form of fringe benefits such as gourmet meals, in-flight
entertainment and limousines to the airport.
But in the past year, the battle in long haul has been about seat size. The
standard industry measures of seat pitch - the distance between seat rows -
has risen from 38-40 inches to more than 50 inches in many cases.
Credit for the change lies partly with UK long-haul specialist Virgin
Atlantic which, for more than a decade, hasoffered business class ticket
holders fully reclining seats. Now the list of those with similar offerings
includes several US, Japanese and European carriers.
The effort that these airlines have put into long-haul business class may be
one factor behind research findings, to be published later this year by the
Official Airlines Guide group of publications. These show that almost
one-sixth of business travellers who regularly use short-haul economy class
have downgraded from business class in the past 12 months. In long haul, by
contrast, the figure was less than one-in-10.
long-haul business class passengers surveyed have traded up from economy in
the past year as have moved up in short-haul.
Many airlines may be congratulating themselves on the success of their
strategy, but one conspicuous bystander so far in the rush to bigger seats
has been British Airways. It has not yet conceded a need to give up its
lucrative long-haul first class service, where it can sell tickets for twice
even the business class price.
Instead, last month it plunged into short-haul by offering bigger seats to
its business passengers flying within Europe.
BA is building into its European fleet an ingenious seating design in which
rows of three 17-inch wide seats can be converted to two 19-inch wide seats
with a useful elbow gap between them. The conversion is mechanical and can
be completed in a few seconds for each row of seats.
The new set-up allows BA to offer business class ticket holders wider seats.
At least as importantly, it retains the flexibility to create a larger
business class section for, say, the first Paris flight of the day, and a
larger economy section for flights later or at the weekend.
overdue. 'Research we conducted two years ago showed that there was
something amiss with business class in Europe,' says Mr Peter Liney, BA's
group brand manager. 'Business class meant little more than a flexible
ticket which you could get by paying full price in economy. Our passengers
told us we were not giving value for money.'
In spite of the hype for its new Club Europe product, BA is not unique in
Europe and was not the first to offer wider seats to its European business
passengers.
The credit for that goes to Swissair which, with Lufthansa, was the last
continental airline to give up first-class travel within Europe in the
1980s. Swissair continued to offer more space in business class, and at the
end of 1993, Lufthansa announced that it, too, was installing variable width
seats.
BA's Mr Liney admits that Lufthansa's and Swissair's products have in the
past been better than BA's.
In the US and Asia, too, the deal for short-haul business travellers is
improving. Established US carriers are seeking weapons with which to defend
themselves against newer, low-cost, no-frills carriers such as South West.
These smaller rivals operate single class aircraft with little or no
on-board catering, low prices and an excellent punctuality record. It is a
formula that has proved popular with leisure and business travellers alike.
American Airlines, Continental and others have responded by using their
three-class international aircraft on longer domestic routes. For
comparison, London-Tel Aviv or Paris-Moscow trips count as European flights
on BA and Air France. The aircraft used will be similar to those used on the
London-Paris route. Flights of a similar length in the US are now sometimes
served by long-haul aircraft switched from international routes.
In Japan there is little likelihood of long-haul seating patterns being
offered domestically. The aircraft have been notoriously crowded, with
around 500 seats crammed into some Boeing 747 shuttles between Tokyo and
Osaka.
In spite of this, All Nippon Airways has seen fit to offer 'super seats' -
seat pitch of 38 inches and width of 20 inches - to 16 domestic
destinations. Furthermore, these seats are on sales at a flat surcharge of
Y7,000, with passengers getting separate check-in, their own lounge,
slippers and a shoehorn. Neither BA nor any western hemisphere carrier is
likely to match this in the near future.
Where BA has a better claim to originality is in the unprecedented level of
marketing behind its relaunched business class. It claims to have planned
the biggest product launch in airline history and is spending Pounds 25m to
advertise to 110m adults in 16 European countries.
This is only the latest stage in BA's strategy of creating branded products
out of airline services. That strategy has already forced other European
carriers to revamp their marketing. 'BA marketing really affected the rest
of us,' says one Swissair executive.
Such are the competitive pressures in European air travel that what has
happened in marketing may spread to business class services. It might only
take a small swing from carriers such as Lufthansa and Air France to BA on
routes where they compete to trigger a response. Business class passengers
across Europe may yet win the space that their ticket price entitles them
to.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (8): Victories in war against
fraud - Some tips on how to deal with bribery and extortion when abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The police officer was adamant. About a mile from Benito Juarez airport in
Mexico City my taxi had run through a red light.
The cab driver shrugged his shoulders and suggested I pay la mordida - the
bite - a Dollars 25 fine for an offence he had not committed.
In Mexico and other developing countries business travellers are easy prey
for police, who impose such fines to augment salaries, which rarely keep
pace with inflation.
Six months and several thousand miles later, it was the same story at
Sheremetyevov Two, Moscow's international airport. Here it is not la mordida
but spekulyatsia - profiteering of the crudest variety.
The first bribe was paid within 10 yards of the terminal: a backhander to
the policeman guarding the taxi rank where my chauffeur - a medic seeking
hard currency - was touting for business from those passengers unwilling to
pay the official taxi rate of up to Dollars 60.
The Guild of Business Travel Agents, whose 40 members handle the travel
arrangements for 86 of the companies in the FTSE-100, advises passengers to
avoid such problems by arranging transfers before departure.
'The best safeguard is to book through reputable agencies based outside
countries where corruption is prevalent,' says Mr David Reynolds, chief
executive of the London-based industry body.
However, Mr Reynolds warns that in many cases the corruption takes place
before the traveller even reaches his destination.
'One of the biggest problems is airline fraud in which stolen tickets are
purchased innocently but turn out to be invalid.'
His claim is backed by the International Air Transport Association. Revenue
lost through ticket fraud totalled Dollars 189m last year, while Iata
estimates that a further Dollars 200m in bogus sales goes unreported.
The most common fraud is perpetrated through the so-called 'bust out', in
which a seemingly reputable travel agency is established, often with
counterfeit bank references, and begins offering business travellers heavily
discounted fares.
In typical cases, the backers disappear with the ticket stock - essentially
thousands of blank cheques to be filled out and sold on to unsuspecting
travellers, mainly through unlicensed bucket shops.
Although ticket barcoding has reduced the ease with which fraudsters can
operate, Iata warns that increasingly sophisticated computer crime is
presenting a fresh challenge to the industry.
Determined to counter that threat, large carriers such as British Airways
have set up their own fraud protection units and constantly update on-line
blacklists of stolen tickets.
That is small consolation for the business traveller whose company, anxious
to curb costs, opted for a cheap ticket not worth the paper it is printed
on.
'If the fare seem the bargain of a lifetime, it's likely the purchaser is
the last in line of a fraud,' says Iata, which advises companies to use
agents approved under its accreditation programme.
Aware that recession has forced businesses to review travel budgets, the
Guild of Business Travel Agents has set up its own low fare unit designed to
protect its clients against corrupt ticket sales.
In some parts of the world, however, a valid ticket home is the least of
their problems - a fact recognised by law enforcement officials in Hong
Kong, the world's eighth largest trading economy.
The colony's Independent Commission Against Corruption received 2,252
corruption reports in the first eight months of this year, a 14 per cent
increase on the same period in 1993.
The rise followed an opinion poll showing that 55.7 per cent of respondents
regarded business sector corruption as 'very prevalent', compared with 41.1
per cent in the previous year.
In a bid to solve the problem, Hong Kong's six main chambers of commerce
have joined forces with more than 1,000 companies to draw up a new code of
business ethics.
The ICAC also hopes to ease executives' fears by drawing up new guidelines
on corruption, which are expected to be published next year. Even so, many
travel managers believe corruption will increase as cross-border trade with
China gathers pace.
The dilemma for executives travelling to destinations with poor corruption
records is whether to believe the advice of major agencies which have an
obvious self-interest in recommending pre-booked and pre-paid arrangements.
In general, such agencies flourish not on the back of corruption fears but
by offering more efficient and secure services. Those unwilling to make
advance bookings could rely alternatively on local business contacts to make
their travel arrangements for them, especially in countries where tickets
can only be purchased with hard currency.
Local company representatives are less obvious targets for fraud and can
bypass many of the hurdles in negotiating rates for services such as office
equipment rental or car hire.
A number of travel agents are also expanding their range of services in some
developing countries. For example, Thomas Cook, whose international business
travel agency operations were acquired recently by American Express, has
launched Moscow's first travel management centre which offers advice on
access to business facilities among other services.
The common message from such agencies is that travellers should register at
their embassy or local consulates during prolonged stays; carry copies of
passports and travel documents; carry local currency in only small
denominations; and, where possible, rely on an approved guide or local
company official to smooth the way through business negotiations.
It is impossible to be immunised against corruption, and no amount of
forward planning can avoid it altogether. But in curbing the spread of this
financial disease, booking through reputable travel organisations can
certainly reduce the risks.
'Corruption oils the wheels in many developing countries,' warns one travel
industry executive. 'We have not won the war against fraud, but at least we
have scored some victories in our campaign.'

FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (7): From the lavish to the
cramped - Separate lounges for commercially important passengers are now
common
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES JENNINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business and first class airport lounges have come on rapidly in the past 20
years.
In the 1970s, separate seating and relaxation areas, owned and run by the
airlines for the benefit of their CIPs (commercially important passengers,
as business and first-class travellers are known) were a rarity. Today, any
airline with pretensions to status will have a scattering of lounges across
the globe, dedicated to its most valued customers.
American Airlines - which claims to have opened the first exclusive CIP
lounge at La Guardia, New York, in 1939 - now operates 42 such lounges
worldwide. United Airlines has 33. Heathrow Airport is home to some 30 CIP
departure lounges (seven of them run by British Airways), with more
expected.
Increasingly, the world's airlines find themselves looking after their
business passengers with the same assiduity on the ground as they do in the
air.
In general, CIP lounges are distinguished from the free-for- all seating
arrangements in the rest of the terminal by the same recurring pattern of
attributes: CIP lounges are open only to those flying first or business
class with the airlines which run them; they offer free drinks and snacks;
they provide enough decent seating to allow passengers to sit and stretch
out; they offer TV, newspapers and washrooms; they will have numerous
telephones; and there will be an area sectioned off for the business
traveller to work in, with desks, a photocopier, a fax machine and the odd
computer modem.
Long-haul operators, such as Qantas, United Airlines and British Airways,
have started adding to this list by installing shower facilities at their
more important destinations. There are even occasional unpredictable extras,
such as the vibro-massage armchairs offered by American Airlines, or the
automatic shoe-cleaners provided by Japan Airlines. As you might expect, CIP
lounges reflect the service provided by the airlines themselves, with all of
them, at the very least, adequate.
But not all airports are equal, and not all airline facilities are the same
at either end of the journey. A lounge at one end of the flight might be
large and lavishly-stocked, while its counterpart at the other end might be
a quarter of the size and a good deal less impressive. Lufthansa, for
instance, has the largest lounge complex at Frankfurt Airport, comprising
four separate facilities for first and business travellers, which together
can comfortably handle more than 2,000 passengers a day.
At Heathrow, on the other hand, Lufthansa has to share a rather austere
80-seater room with Air France, which, on the admission of one of the staff,
can become a little crowded late on Friday afternoons.
Worse still, Alitalia, TAP, Olympic and Swissair are all crammed into one
small, unprepossessing room along a far corridor of Terminal 2, far removed
from the grandeur of BA's establishment. On this basis, one should learn to
expect a lavish CIP lounge at the home airport of any airline, but to take
whatever is provided at the destination end, without undue preconceptions.
On top of this is the airline's judgment of what the CIP lounge is really
there for. How much of the facility should be given over to work and how
much to relaxation? And how, given the restraints existing at many airports,
can it make some kind of positive statement about the airline which owns it?
The Americans, not unsurprisingly, tend to place the emphasis on the work
side of things. American Airlines' gargantuan facility at Chicago's O'Hare
Airport covers 14,000 sq ft, boasts 19 bookable conference rooms, offers
paper-shredding equipment and, significantly, a bar which serves free
coffee, tea and iced water, but liquor only at a price. The furnishings
might be described as comfortable without being plush; and as a temporary
office for the determined businessman, it is hard to fault.
The Japanese, similarly, organise their lounges at Narita, Tokyo, as
smartly-furnished waiting rooms rather than as private clubs. The big
advantage of their three CIP facilities (two executive class, one first or
Sakura class) is that together they occupy more space than that of any other
airline. Given the limitations on space at Tokyo's principal airport, this
is a real boon, despite their somewhat unengaging atmosphere, with their
ranks of armchairs, and their furtive 'Relax Corners'.
British Airways tries to address the problem of business efficiency versus
the need for a welcoming environment by making its lounges more like the
interior of a Forte hotel foyer. BA's lounge spaces - especially the
agglomeration at Heathrow's Terminal 4 - are strong on warm woods, low
lighting and friendly wool fabrics. The self-service drinks and food
counters are tempting, while the workstations are writing-desks with an
extra phone on top, as opposed to the purposeful cubicles offered by
American, or their rivals, United Airlines. It is a typically English
compromise, in which the world of work is kept at arm's length.
Heathrow is, in fact, unusually well-stocked with CIP lounges - reflecting
its position as a hub international airport and a crucial staging-post: one
in three of Heathrow's passengers connects between flights. And it is
because of this that some airlines are branching out into new types of
facility for business and first class travellers.
British Airways has recently spent Pounds 1.6m on a new arrivals lounge at
Terminal 4, catering for passengers who have just come off an overnight
transatlantic flight and who need to spruce themselves up at the start of
the day. Instead of comfortable chairs and free drinks, the CIPs are offered
23 shower rooms, a clothes pressing service and a continental breakfast.
American Airways has followed suit, with the difference that its arrivals
lounge at Heathrow is at Terminal 3 and contains nine showers. United
Airlines will soon be offering competition in this line, but it may have to
strike a deal with a nearby hotel if it is unable to find the space at
Terminal 3.
Elsewhere at Terminal 3, Virgin Atlantic is trying something altogether
different. While its New York lounge is relatively conventional in approach,
the Virgin Clubhouse at Heathrow attempts to subvert the notion of the CIP
lounge as a comfy but uninspiring hinterland between work and relaxation,
between waiting and doing. The Clubhouse aims to make travel fun for the
business executive. To this end, it boasts a music room, a computer games
arcade, a three-tonne model of a galleon, a massage salon, a hairdresser, a
well-stocked bar and a model railway.
It cost over Pounds 1m to fit the place out, and despite a token fax and
photocopier, its whole philosophy runs counter to the essentially
utilitarian values of other airlines' facilities. And as a tool for building
loyalty to what is, after all, an extremely small player in international
aviation, it works brilliantly.
Realistically, it is hard to imagine Virgin's rivals taking a leaf out of
the Clubhouse book. But it shows that the airport lounge can be more than a
mere waiting-room, if enough people want it that way.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (6): Top of the waiting list -
Daniel Green says frequent flyer programmes have reached maturity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The business of frequent flyer programmes (FFPs) has in the past year moved
from adolescence to maturity. The vast majority of business travellers in
Europe belong to at least one scheme. To keep them, individual schemes are
being forced to compare their own incentives with their rivals' and improve
them where necessary.
A more subtle change is taking place, too. Passengers are recognising that
earning the right to do yet more air travel in their spare time is not
necessarily the best reason for joining such a programme. Other benefits
such as priority in the waiting list on overbooked flights is more
important. And redeeming points for leisure flights seems to be less
important than it was. Airlines are heeding these signals as they prepare
the next round of incentives for their scheme members.
Most FFPs work by offering scheme members 'points' or 'miles' in rough
proportion to the distance travelled and multiplied by a factor relating to
the class of travel. These points can be exchanged for free flights, seat
upgrades or other benefits.
After some scares in the 1980s when the schemes were new - the now defunct
Pan Am was reportedly giving away so many miles that some aircraft flew
without a single fare-paying passenger on board - airlines are careful not
to give away too much.
They can do this because on average, the world's aircraft fly about
two-thirds full. Airlines are happy to use the empty seats as a marketing
tool. They use computer forecasts of demand to allocate what they believe
will be unsold seats to the FFP.
The effect, as anyone who has tried to cash in points will have found out,
is that it is easy to get a free ticket with your frequent flyer points on
the 0650 from London to Amsterdam on a Saturday but not on a Monday.
And to make sure that passengers do not accumulate so many points as to risk
a deluge of point redemptions on a holiday weekend later in the decade,
European FFPs have time limits. Members who fail to cash in their points
within two or three years lose them.
In the case of British Airways, leisure travellers get a poor deal: they do
not earn points unless they have paid full price for their tickets. US
carriers offer points for almost all trips and BA has been forced to do the
same for its US-based members.
In spite of these limitations, FFPs are a huge success in Europe. Some 86
per cent of European business travellers belong to a frequent flyer scheme,
up from 82 per cent last year, according to market research to be published
later this year by the Official Airlines Guide.
Among the busiest travellers - those making more than 20 trips a year - an
astonishing 97 per cent are members of at least one scheme.
The research found virtually the same level of membership in the UK, France
and Ger- many. But though in each case, the national airline's scheme was
easily the most popular, there were wide differences in different countries
between favourite FFPs.
In the UK, 52 per cent of travellers said BA's FFP was the best, compared
with 47 per cent in Germany who picked Lufthansa, while in France only 34
per cent said Air France's beat its rivals.
This may have been because of the success of competitor airlines in winning
business from Air France. Popular among French travellers were schemes
offered by US carriers Delta and TWA, neither of which figured in responses
from UK travellers.
Air France has recognised that there have been problems with its FFP and
earlier this year revamped it. Unlike BA, for example, cut-price economy
fares qualify for points, and two free tickets can be had for only 1 1/2
times the points required for one ticket.
Carriers still vary somewhat in the levels of reward that they offer.
Between BA, Luft- hansa, Air France, American Airlines and Delta, for
example, it takes between one and five business class trips between Europe
and the east coast of the US to earn enough points for one free economy
flight between London and either Frankfurt or Paris.
The best deal comes from BA because it skews its points allocations in
favour of north American routes. You may feel that after business class
flights to Sydney, Australia, and back, you deserve all the points you get.
In fact, a round trip to Boston would have earned you three times as many.
There are interesting dif- ferences between what airlines count as a
European flight. It takes six London to Tel Aviv business class flights on
BA to earn one London-Paris return, but only two trips via Paris on Air
France.
For short-haul rewards in Europe, you may be best off with Lufthansa or
Swissair, whose minimum number of points can be exchanged for free flights
that will take you to most countries in western Europe.
It is little wonder then, that four out of five European business travellers
belong to more than one FFP. The average number of member- ships is about
three.
A glance at the main reasons for joining an FFP soon ex- plains why multiple
member- ship is the logical thing to do. While 54 per cent of travellers
rate free flights as 'very important', 72 per cent said their top priority
was to be at the head of the waiting list for overbooked flights.
Too many regular travellers know both the pain of being denied boarding
after a hard day's work and that the decision about who flies and who does
not is taken on the ground a few minutes before departure. Any lever to
improve the chances of getting aboard is to be grasped.
Naturally, this has led quickly to a series of refinements as FFPs are used
to retain the loyalty of the airline's best customers.
Lufthansa's frequent flyers earn automatic upgrades to bigger rooms in
several hotel chains, including the Hilton, Sheraton and Regent. Holders of
BA's gold card are guar- anteed a seat on most BA flights if the reservation
is made more than 24 hours in advance. The unsaid corollary is that those
who fail to meet these specifications risk being bounced off the flight if
it is full.
There are new ways of redeeming points, too. The US is in the advance guard
here with American Airlines FFP points exchangeable for flowers or
restaurant meals.
For the airlines' best customers, some benefits are as attractive as free
flights and new ways of earning points are an agreeable way to top up their
scores. FFP operators are therefore likely to put an increasing part of
their creative energies into their programmes.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (4): Substitute for the
'impersonal' hotel - Staying in a serviced apartment can ease the strain of
working away from home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATE BEVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wouldn't it be nice when you're away from home on business to be able to
stay in a place where you could relax?
Hotel rooms, even the most luxurious, can be soulless, and not everybody
wants to pay for frills such as room service and a grand reception area.
Regular travellers may prefer somewhere to relax with a light supper rather
than eat alone in a formal hotel dining-room.
They may also want to hold a meeting without being overheard by all and
sundry or having to use a hotel's expensive business centre.
The answer is a serviced apartment. These are something between a
residential let and a grand but impersonal hotel room, and for the
not-so-wealthy traveller, they also offer financial savings.
In general, serviced apartments have something of a home-from-home
atmosphere, with the added advantage of daily maid service and a concierge.
Many are also well-equipped for business needs and will either have a fax in
the apartment itself or access via the concierge to fax machines, as well as
additional telephone lines and satellite television.
Others offer services such as babysitting for those who bring the family on
trips, laundry, a limousine service and access to swimming pools, gyms and
gardens. And of course all will have kitchens in case the traveller wants to
cook rather than eat in a restaurant or risk the local take-away.
Serviced apartments are a particularly good idea for single women
travellers, who may find a hotel lonely and threatening. Single travellers
of both genders may sometimes find themselves in poky hotel rooms next to
the lift shaft, or with a view of the back of another building, while paying
a high single supplement.
Women may feel uncomfortable eating alone, and regular travellers report
being relegated to tiny tables behind plants and next to kitchen doors,
while a hotel bar can be an intimidating place. One regular traveller
reports that, more than once, she has had to resist unwelcome male
attentions in a hotel bar while staff have ignored her plight: for her, the
privacy of a serviced apartment would be a blessing.
For longer trips some like to combine business with a family holiday, so an
apartment with proper cooking facilities and a washing machine can make an
ideal base.
Serviced apartments are also often used by leisure travellers for the same
reasons - the convenience of a comfortable base together with cost savings.
Mr Dev Anand, sales and marketing director of The Apartment Service, a
London-based agency, says this type of traveller tends to be the
'adventurous second- or third-time visitor' to a city.
Hotels sometimes have as many different rates as they have rooms. First,
there is the published rate. Then, there is the corporate rate. Then, there
is the 'It's a Sunday in January and anything is better than nothing' rate.
And then, there's the rate that a cheeky traveller can convince the
receptionist to offer.
Not so with serviced apartments, according to Mr Anand. As they offer a
saving of up to 30 per cent on hotel rooms, they are an attractive
alternative for a longer stay.
Mr Anand's service offers studio apartments sleeping two people in central
London from about Pounds 275 a week. Set against a hotel rate, this starts
to make good financial sense, and while there is always room for some
negotiation on prices, generally for a serviced apartment you can expect to
pay the published rate.
The key to this is low overheads. You won't be tripping over chambermaids
and bellhops, but at the same time you won't be paying for them. And while a
few properties will have a restaurant or bar, most do not. Nor will they
have an ornate lobby and armies of lift attendants. But equally you won't
start chatting to someone in the bar and discover that he is paying
considerably less than you for the same room because it was booked through a
different travel agent or because his company has negotiated a better
corporate rate.
Locations for serviced apartments are often as good as, if not better, than
hotels. The Apartment Service has flats near Olympia and Earls Court in
London and Mr Anand says that companies exhibiting for several days will
often put a sales team up in an apartment.
For example, a three-bedroom apartment in a building in Kensington, handy
for both exhibition centres, costs from Pounds 1,000 a week, and allows
companies to keep a tighter rein on overall expenses.
Another more recent entrant to the market is Grosvenor House Apartments,
within the Grosvenor House hotel in central London.
These also offer a private entrance, reception and concierge - keeping the
apartment-dwellers separate from the rush of hotel traffic, as well as
twice-daily maid service, fresh linens every day and use of the hotel's
fitness facilities. It also offers use of the hotel's other facilities such
as room service and a business centre.
The concept comes from the US where all-suite hotels, as they are known,
began as mid-market accommodation and developed into the more upmarket type
of property now being offered in Britain and in the rest of the world.
Keith Prowse, the ticket agency, acts as an agent for serviced apartments in
Vienna, Brussels, Copenhagen and Helsinki, as well as for various locations
in France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands. In the UK, it is the agent for
properties in London and provincial towns, including Bath, Birmingham and
Edinburgh.
These are definitely a longer-term option: while you may be able to stay for
just a couple of nights, most services will want you to stay for at least a
week, and many use serviced apartments for much longer, up to several months
in some cases. Mr Anand points out that this is a good stop-gap between the
short-term hotel and a longer-term residential let. 'Most estate agents
won't deal in anything less than six months, but a hotel looks expensive for
more than a couple of nights,' he says.
It seems like the best of both worlds: a comfortable base with all the
facilities of a hotel that you are likely to want without the frills - and
without the high costs.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (5): Book-your-own trend catches
on - Travel agencies discover they are not indispensable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some large US companies have begun to ask a question which should be giving
business travel agents sleepless nights. The question is this: 'Can't we
book our own flights and hotel rooms?'
International hoteliers confirm that some large companies are approaching
them directly rather than through their business travel agents. IBM, the US
computer group, makes its own arrangements with large airlines and then
simply gets its travel agent to implement them.
A company called Business Travel Contractors - which groups large US
concerns such as General Motors, Merck and Black &amp; Decker - plans to use its
buying power to get better rates from the airlines. For their part, the
airlines would not pay any agents' com- mission. They would also not give
business travellers from the companies concerned any frequent flyer points.
Companies which decide to make their own arrangements are not the only
problem that business travel agents face. Those companies - the vast
majority - which still rely on conventional agents for their needs are
increasingly insisting that they want to be represented by the same
organisation throughout the US, or throughout Europe, or even worldwide.
Travel agents without worldwide rep- resentation are finding it difficult to
win business from some of these multinational clients.
Another pressure on travel agents is the need to invest in information
technology. Only the most advanced computer systems can provide travel
agents with the information that they need to service customers on a
worldwide basis.
The realisation that it did not have sufficient mass in crucial areas of the
world was one of the main reasons why Thomas Cook, the UK-based group,
decided to withdraw from offering business travel services.
Thomas Cook is owned by Westdeutsche Landesbank. This meant that under US
banking regulations it could not offer business travel services directly in
the US. The Thomas Cook name in the US was controlled by a franchisee, Mr
David Paresky. Thomas Cook also balked at the cost of investing in
additional information technology.
Last month, Thomas Cook sold its business travel operations to American
Express, which also acquired Mr Paresky's interests in the US. American
Express paid a total of Dollars 375m to Thomas Cook and Mr Paresky, though
it refused to reveal how the sum was divided between the two parties.
Thomas Cook said it would now concentrate on its remaining businesses:
leisure travel, travellers' cheques and foreign exchange.
The American Express- Thomas Cook deal was the second large consolidation in
the business travel sector this year. Last March, Carlson of the US and
Wagonlit of France announced that they had decided to combine their business
travel operations. The two groups said that Carlson's strong presence in the
US would be combined with Wagonlit's extensive European interests.
Given the threat from several large corporations to take care of their own
business travel arrangements, some industry observers see the emergence of
two large groups - American Express and Carlson Wagonlit - as a classic
defensive move designed to achieve greater control over a declining market.
Both groups strongly contest this argument and say that if they are having
sleepless nights, it is only through excitement at the opportunities that
lie ahead.
Mr Eric Brannan, senior European vice-president of American Express business
travel operations, says talk of companies making their own travel
arrangements is over- blown. The number of com- panies which are large and
experienced enough to strike their own deals with airlines and hotels is
small.
Even if a company were to use its buying power to negotiate a group discount
with a particular airline, it would find it difficult to discover whether it
could have negotaited an even cheaper deal from a rival carrier.
Mr Brannan says: 'No airline is going to tell you that another airline can
sell you tickets more cheaply. Only a travel agent can do that.' He argues
that the deregulation of the airline industry in the US has made it even
more difficult for companies to discover what the best deals are. Future
airline dereg- ulation in Europe will make finding the cheapest fares an
even more complex task.
He adds that for companies to make their travel arrangements themselves
would run counter to one of the most significant business trends of the past
decade: companies contracting out peripheral services to concentrate on
their core businesses.
Mr Colin Rainbow, commercial director of Carlson Wagonlit, says his group's
enlarged global representation is already producing new business. He says
that clients of Wagonlit in Europe have now asked the merged business travel
group to handle their arrangements in the US.
Similarly, Carlson clients in the US have asked the group to make their
business travel arrangements in Europe. Mr Brannan admits that companies are
not finding it easy to appoint a single business travel agent worldwide.
Many have done it throughout the US but companies are only now starting to
appoint a single agent for Europe.
Even appointing a single European agent can cause problems, he says.
National subsidiaries in Europe often have a high level of autonomy and
resent being told what to do by head office. Nevertheless, Mr Brannan
estimates that he spends about 20 per cent of his time talking to clients
who are trying to arrange their travel across Europe through a single agent.
To compete, Mr Brannan says, agents have to go beyond booking hotels and
airline tickets. They have to prove to clients that they can offer them an
increasingly high quality of information on their business travel practices.
An essential tool in collecting the information is a plastic card. By
offering business travellers a charge card as part of its business travel
service, American Express has a means of collecting spending data for
clients.
The importance of being able to offer clients a plastic card is recognised
throughout the industry. Thomas Cook cited not being able to offer its own
plastic card as another important reason for leaving the business travel
industry. Carlson Wagonlit concedes that it, too, will have to offer a
plastic card as part of its service. Mr Rainbow says the group is
negotiating with card issuers.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (2): Hotel discount boom may be
ending - International occupancy rates seem to be rising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The international travel business has been hard hit in the last few years.
The 180 members of Iata, the Inter- national Air Transport Assoc- iation,
collectively lost Dollars 4bn in 1993 - making a cumulative loss of Dollars
15bn for the years 1990-93. It has been a tough time for airlines, and
conse- quently a tough time for hoteliers, too.
However, business travellers have been able to pick up some bargain prices,
as the rack rate - the officially published rate charged by hotels - has
rarely matched the achieved rate - the rate actually obtained by the hotel
from the guest.
Everyone's cloud is someone else's silver lining, and nowhere is that more
true than in the recent doldrums blighting the hotel industry. Hotel
occupancy rates throughout Europe have on average been hovering around the
mid to low 60 per cent mark, at least until this year. The consequence for
business - and other - travellers has been considerable scope for hard
bargaining on price.
Hoteliers everywhere responded to the drop in demand by focusing on keeping
their occupancy levels as high as possible. The motto was: build volume
first, tackle prices later.
Thus, more and deeper concessionary rates have been available in all
business hotels situated in the world's key cities. So much so, that
travellers have perhaps grown accustomed to thinking that reduced rates are
here to stay.
But things are changing, quite patchily at the moment, but at a speed which
might catch some travellers on the hop. According to Mr Andrew Duncan, a
director with hotel and leisure consultants Pan- nell Kerr Forster
Associates, the market last year began to improve, albeit in fits and
starts. Thus, while in 1993 the average occupancy rate in European hotels
was 62.8 per cent - 0.5 percentage points lower than in 1992 - London's
business hotels achieved 74 per cent, their best performance for several
years.
Against that relative improvement in London, in continental Europe as a
whole, the room revenue yield per available room in 1993 was DM130.88, a
fall of 9 per cent on 1992's figures. In some cities, such as Vienna, where
a relative over-supply of hotel rooms is set to continue into 1995, bargains
are obviously still to be had.
Yet the broad picture suggests that the good times - for travellers at least
 -are probably over. Mr Michael Ball, marketing and sales director of Utell
International, the world's largest hotel reservations company, dealing with
6,500 hotels across 147 countries, says: 'That period of turmoil, of
mismatch between supply and demand, is coming to an end.
'Two years ago there was heavy discounting in the hotel business. You could
walk into virtually any hotel and it would have rooms to sell. But
occupancies everywhere have risen significantly in this year compared with
last.
'The Farnborough Air Show used to be considered a bit of a test of the UK
market. For the last few years, hotels have not filled during the show -
this year they did.'
In the UK, the recovery is particularly strong in London where at the moment
average occupancy rates are around 90 per cent, against the low 60s in 1992
and 1993. With such rates, hotels can afford to be sniffy about discounting,
and refuse even to consider such a request from an individual traveller who
walks in off the street.
Yet so battle-scarred is the hotel industry that few people are prepared to
say that the worst is over; the last three years have, in Mr Ball's words,
'been so horrendous for the hotel business' that it is premature to say the
current recovery is permanent.
'All that can be said with confidence right now is that hotels in the UK,
the US and Asia have seen their average occupancy levels rise this year. And
when demand increases, prices firm up, as with any other business.
'Furthermore, there are internationally no black spots on the horizon.
Everyone is now doing their budgeting, with a view that 1995 is going to be
a good year. Hoteliers are saying to themselves that, now occupancy rates
are stronger, they need to pay attention to closing the gap between achieved
and published rates for a room. There is the nub of the whole argument,'
says Mr Ball.
The clearest indication that the discount boom is ending is that Utell's
achieved rate went up in September for the first time in a couple of years.
Analysts argue it is still far too early in the recovery cycle for rack
rates - published rates - to be increased, but special or distress sale
rates are probably already a thing of the past.
Preferred, or negotiated, corporate rates are likely to firm up or even rise
in the course of 1995, according to Mr Ball.
That is the bad news for the tight-budget traveller. The good news is that
if they are prepared to try, most trav- ellers, even individuals, can now
get a corporate rate - ie, some reduction on the rack, or published price -
throughout Europe and the US, in city centre hotels. And negotiated rates,
where hotels give signif- icant reductions in return for promised volume
bookings by a large agent or corporation, are of course still a key part of
this business.
However, even that depends on your destination. In Asia, where many
countries have either avoided the recession altogether or been cushioned
from its worst effects, the prob- lem is frequently not so much obtaining a
discount as getting a room. In some parts of Asia 'negotiated rates are now
being withdrawn from the mar- ket - corporate rates are as good a reduction
as you can expect,' says Mr Ball.
drawn from this highly fragmented market, now poised for probable recovery
but jittery that another Gulf war or similar major international upheaval
might erupt?
The days of the daft discount are probably over for the foreseeable future.
The negotiated rate is under threat in those economies currently booming in
Asia and some parts of Latin America, such as Argentina. The corporate rate
survives, healthily in Europe and the US, precariously in some parts of
Asia. And if there is another year or two of such relative tranquillity,
then rack rates are bound to nudge upwards.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (3): Floor them with your poise -
The advantages of staying in executive territory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The intriguing question about executive floors is why anyone chooses to stay
in any other part of a five-star hotel.
It is not just that the services offered on executive floors are superior to
those elsewhere in the hotel - though they are. It is that executive or
business floors make sense financially: they usually cost Dollars 20 to
Dollars 40 more a night than rooms in other parts of the hotel. But that
includes a free breakfast and complimentary snacks and drinks.
Stay on an ordinary floor and you will pay for breakfast, as well as for
snacks and drinks from the minibar in your room. Breakfast on its own could
cost you Dollars 20 or more. You could well end up paying no more for your
executive floor room than for accommodation elsewhere in the hotel.
Tell Mr Geoffrey Breeze, corporate vice president for marketing at Hilton
International, that you do not understand why his guests stay anywhere other
than on an executive floor and he replies: 'We don't understand it either.'
Mr Breeze says there might be some kind of psychological barrier which
inhibits guests from staying on executive floors. It is more likely that
hotel guests think that booking a room on an executive floor will not go
down well with the cost-cutting managements in their companies. Even though
executive floors might not end up costing more, they do not provide the
impression of austerity that many companies are seeking to enforce through
their corporate travel policies.
Hilton International, which is owned by Ladbroke, the UK leisure and gaming
group, has had executive floors since the 1970s. However, the idea of having
separate floors for higher-paying guests really took off in Asia during the
1980s.
The idea was to cater for business travellers who were looking for that
added bit of comfort and convenience. In most of the international hotel
chains with executive floors, guests who use them do not check in or out at
the reception desk in the lobby.
Instead, they go straight up to the business floor and check in at a
dedicated check-in desk. They usually eat their free breakfast in a dining
room on the executive floor, separate from that used by other guests in the
hotel.
Most executive floors have meeting rooms which guests can use free of any
additional charge. There are facsimile machines, often in the rooms
themselves. Many of the executive floors have libraries, with business books
and trade directories. Most business floors offer newspapers and business
magazines.
The rooms on the executive floors are furnished to a higher standard than in
other parts of the hotel.
Executive floors have become so popular in Asia that the Inter-Continental
resort hotel in Bali, Indonesia, has an entire executive wing, complete with
its own swimming pool.
Executive floors have now spread to other parts of the world, too.
Inter-Continental this year inaugurated its first executive floors in
Europe; they can now be found in the Inter-Continental in Frankfurt and at
the Churchill Inter-Continental in London. In the Middle East, the chain has
business floors in several locations, including Egypt, Jordan and Saudi
Arabia. Executive floors are common in North America. And Inter-Continental
now has business floors under construction in Latin America.
Of Hilton International's 132 hotels, 64 now have business floors. About 10
per cent of the chain's total room stock is located on executive floors.
The idea of the business floor, Mr Breeze says, is 'to provide the
atmosphere and attention to detail you might get in a private club but with
the full support of an international hotel behind it.'
Mr Breeze says Hilton International's customer surveys have indicated that
different nationalities appear to have different reasons for wanting to stay
on an executive floor. 'British respondents to the survey see the executive
floor more as a place to relax than respondents from some other countries,
who see it as a place to get work done. Germans are interested in using
executive floors to entertain their guests, to have meetings and to do
business.'
Ms Melanie Baker, of Inter-Continental, offers another attraction of
executive floors, based on her own experience. 'For a woman, it provides an
extra feeling of security,' she says. In some of Inter-Continental's hotels
 -in San Francisco, for example - access to the executive floor can only be
gained through the use of a special key in the lift.
While the desire for security and freedom from attack or harassment is a
universal phenomenon, Mr Breeze says other aspects of executive floors have
to be adapted for different markets.
In more libertarian countries, executive floors might offer free alcoholic
drinks throughout the day. In countries where drinking is frowned on,
alcohol might be available only in the evening.
In cities with a wide range of restaurants, Hilton International has found
that most of the executive floor guests go out for dinner, but then expect
to be offered late night drinks and coffee. In countries where the
anti-tobacco lobby is particularly powerful, non-smoking executive floors
are provided.
Whatever claims international hotel chains make for executive floors, they
have undeniably introduced a class system into five-star establishments.
Some guests get better treatment than others.
Unlike the economy class airline passengers who are forced to walk through
first and business class on their way to their cramped, inferior seats,
ordinary hotel guests do not have the superior privileges of executive floor
customers shoved in their faces.
Nevertheless, if executive floor guests can have such additional services as
complimentary breakfast and a library, why can these facilities not be
extended to all guests staying in what is, after all, a top-class
establishment?
Hoteliers argue that all they are doing is responding to market demand: they
have identified a proportion of their customers who want the additional
facilities and services. If this number grows, the number of executive
floors will be increased.
What the hotel chains insist they will not do is follow the airlines, which
routinely upgrade customers from economy to business class. Requests for an
upgrade from a room without a view to one with one will be considered. But a
transfer to the executive floor will be politely refused, such hotels say.
If guests want to stay on an executive floor, they will have to pay for it.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (1): Global trends, national
traits - While the industry is putting recession behind it, some countries
are still languishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
When British business travellers step onto an aircraft, they leave behind
hordes of envious friends and colleagues. Friends and colleagues of German
business travellers, on the other hand, are more likely to pity than envy
them.
These are some of the findings of a recent survey into the attitudes and
experiences of business travellers in 10 European countries carried out in
June by Visa International, the payments group. The differences between
travellers from the 10 countries are the most striking features of the
survey (see charts, pages 2, 8 and 16).
Sixty per cent of Dutch business travellers feel lonely when they travel;
only 36 per cent of Spaniards do. Only 29 per cent of Dutch travellers enjoy
staying at hotels, compared with 56 per cent of Greeks.
Yet this year has seen three large takeovers in the travel industry, all
based on the idea that business travel is now global and that travel agents
need to be able to service clients in the same way, whether they live in
Caracas or Kuala Lumpur.
In March, Wagonlit of France announced it was combining its business travel
interests with those of Carlson of the US to create a network with combined
revenues of Dollars 10.8bn, operating from 4,000 locations in 125 countries.
The new company, Carlson Wagonlit Travel, said it wanted to 'service the
growing needs of the global business traveller'.
Last month, American Express paid Dollars 375m to buy the business travel
operations of Thomas Cook outside the US and all the company's interests in
the US.
Thomas Cook's reason for leaving the business travel industry had a familiar
ring: it did not have sufficient international representation to cater for
the global needs of the business traveller. In particular, Thomas Cook's US
business had to be operated by a franchisee. This was because Thomas Cook is
owned by Westdeutsche Landesbank and US banking legislation prevented it
from operating an American travel business itself.
Both groups claim that the process of integrating two companies is going
well. Travel industry insiders, however, believe the American Express/Thomas
Cook grouping has a betterchance of success than Carlson Wagonlit.
Their first reason is that American Express has taken over Thomas Cook
rather than setting up a joint venture with it. There is no doubt about who
will be in charge.
Although Thomas Cook is German-owned, it began in the UK over 150 years ago
and shares an English-speaking background with American Express. The two
companies have both competed and co-operated over the years. When American
Express began producing traveller's cheques in 1891, Thomas Cook helped to
ensure the new product's success by agreeing to accept it in its 150 offices
throughout the world.
Carlson Wagonlit is a joint venture rather than a takeover, which means that
two parties, rather than one, will have to agree its future strategy. The
two companies are also markedly different from one another: Carlson is a
privately-owned US group, while Wagonlit is part of Accor, the French hotel
and catering concern.
Another takeover aimed at winning business from the international traveller
was the acquisition last month by Forte, the UK hotel and restaurants group,
of Meridien, the international hotel chain controlled by Air France.
The takeover should turn Forte from a largely British group into an
international chain, ready to compete with the likes of Hilton
International, Sheraton and Inter-Continental. Once again, one of Forte's
main reasons for making the acquisition was that international travellers
often use the same hotel chain wherever they are in the world.
But does this global traveller really exist? If the Visa International
survey - which was carried out among 2,000 readers of Executive Travel and
International Management magazines - reveals substantial differences among
European travellers, there are surely even greater disparities when US and
Asian travellers are considered, too.
Even international hoteliers admit that most of their customers are not
global travellers. Mr Tommaso Zanzotto, chief executive of Hilton
International, says that at his company's eight properties in Germany, 80
per cent of the guests are German. At Hilton International's four hotels in
Japan, between 85 per cent and 88 per cent of customers are Japanese.
Mr Gavin Simonds, joint managing director of Inter-Continental hotels, says
that travel within regions, such as the Asia-Pacific area, is a more common
feature of contemporary business travel than trips across the world.
Nevertheless, Mr Simonds insists hotel chains with international brand names
still have an important role. While only 10 per cent to 15 per cent of
guests in a typical five-star hotel might have made an inter-continental
journey to get there, a chain without an internationally recognised name
would find it hard to win their custom.
Mr Simonds says: 'There are various tiers in the travel market and the
global travellers are at the top. We can address that market where others
can't. But if you just address that market, you will fail. You have to look
after the regional and the local market as well. If you forget those, you do
so at your peril.'
Mr Eric Brannan, senior European vice president of American Express business
travel operations, insists, however, that his clients around the world do
have similar needs. 'They all get into a taxi, they all get onto an
aeroplane, they all sleep in hotel beds,' he says.
While this is certainly true, the Visa International survey shows that
travellers disagree about what sort of hotels they should stay in. While 75
per cent of Greek respondents to the survey agreed that 'business travellers
deserve the luxuries of top class travel', only 44 per cent of Italians and
45 per cent of
French travellers agreed.
While 41 per cent of British travellers thought it was very important to
have a prompt laundry service in a hotel, only 17 per cent of Spaniards
regarded it as very important. Asked how important it was to have a
television set in their hotel room, 53 per cent of Greeks thought it was
very important, but only 28 per cent of Belgians.
It is true that the Visa International survey also showed areas of
similarity between business travellers from the 10 European countries.
The vast majority, for example, believe that business travel will continue
to be necessary. Over 90 per cent of British and Danish business travellers
agreed with the proposition: 'One-to-one meetings are invaluable, so
business travel is here to stay'. The country whose travellers expressed the
most scepticism about this statement was Italy, but even there 72 per cent
thought business travel was here to stay.
The business travel industry says there are certainly signs that their
business is now beginning to put the North American and European recession
behind it. Mr Zanzotto says business travel in both the US and Canada has
picked up since the end of last year. The UK is also improving, with
business in London particularly strong.
The south-east Asian economies are performing well, he says. Even Australia,
which was particularly badly hit by the downturn is improving, although
Sydney still has too many hotel rooms.
Business travel is still languishing in some countries, however. They
include Japan, Germany, France and the Benelux countries, he says.
The Visa International survey appears to show that although business travel
might be reviving, business travellers have little taste for the luxuries of
the 1980s or many of the perks that some hotel chains still seem intent on
providing.
Few European business travellers see the need for a limousine service to
pick them up from the airport. In all cases, only 10 per cent or fewer
travellers thought this was a very important service. In Norway, no business
traveller thought it was very important.
So too with fitness centres, regarded by upmarket hoteliers as an essential
offering. The proportion of travellers who said fitness centres were very
important to them did not exceed 23 per cent in any European country.

MONDAY
EU convergence criteria
The European Commission is to make recommendations on how all European Union
member states except Luxembourg and Ireland should bring down their budget
deficits and government debt, to get in line with the Maastricht treaty
requirements for European monetary union.
The advice, due at a meeting of EU finance ministers in Luxembourg, is the
first instance of the so-called 'excessive budgets procedure' envisaged by
Maastricht. Unusually, the Commission recommendations are likely to be made
public, partly to avoid any speculative pressure on the currencies of the
most indebted states, such as Italy.
Security in Europe:
Officials from 53 European, North American and former Soviet states gather
to start preparing for the December summit of the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe. Russia wants the CSCE to be given greater powers to
intervene in local conflicts, and is also seeking western approval for its
military presence in the republics on its southern border.
UK economics:
Minutes of the September 7 meeting between Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the
exchequer, and Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England (left), are
published. The duo decided to raise base rates from 5.25 to 5.75 per cent,
but the decision required a second meeting two days later. Their debate may
provide clues on the future direction of base rates.
Nobel prizes:
The annual season gets under way in Stockholm with the announcement of the
prize for medicine. Tomorrow and Wednesday see the awards for economics,
physics and chemistry. On Friday, the stage shifts to Oslo for the peace
prize announcement. Hot favourites for the peace prize are Yassir Arafat,
Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres for their part in the Middle East peace
process.
Romanian students protesting at educational conditions have threatened to
chain themselves to railway tracks.
UK politics:
The House of Lords, the unelected upper chamber of parliament, returns after
its summer recess.
FT Survey: Business Travel.
Holidays:
Argentina (Columbus Day), Canada (Thanksgiving), Japan, Kenya, Peru, South
Africa (Kruger Day), Taiwan, US (Columbus Day).
TUESDAY
War crimes tribunal
The chief prosecutor in the International War Crimes Tribunal, Richard
Goldstone, is to hold a press conference in The Hague after his first visit
to former Yugoslavia.
Judge Goldstone last week visited Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia to try to
persuade the authorities to hand over war criminals. The Tribunal's first
indictments are due to be made by November.
Tory party conference:
Britain's governing party opens its annual conference in the resort of
Bournemouth on the south coast of England (to Oct 14). The leadership is
determined to avoid the temptation to attack Tony Blair's new-look
opposition Labour party and will try to concentrate on what it sees as the
government's solid record of achievement - particularly in its handling of
the economy.
Prime minister John Major speaks on Friday.
Potential flashpoints include Northern Ireland, and home affairs, where the
performance of struggling home secretary Michael Howard will be monitored
closely.
Pakistan opposition leader Nawaz Sharif has called a general strike as part
of an anti-government campaign; prime minister Benazir Bhutto has called for
talks with the opposition.
Peru election deadline:
Hopefuls for the Peruvian presidential election next April have to register
their candidacy by today. The incumbent, Alberto Fujimori, has already
confirmed that he will stand again. Fujimori's many challengers include his
estranged wife, Susana Higuchi, who must win a ruling from a constitutional
court to overturn a bar on relatives of the head of state standing for the
presidency, and 74-year-old former UN secretary-general, Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
Bid to smash Windows:
IBM attempts to oust Microsoft's Windows operating system for desktop
computers from its market dominance by launching Warp, a new version of its
OS/2. Its attack comes at a bad time for Microsoft, whose own challenger,
Chicago, has been delayed.
Saleroom:
Two miniatures by Nicholas Hilliard, who portrayed the characters of the
Elizabethan Court, come up for auction at Sotheby's in London. One of Queen
Elizabeth I, dated to 1590, is estimated at Pounds 6,000 while a melancholic
young man could make Pounds 30,000. They are part of a group of 200
miniatures collected by the late RL Bayne-Powell.
WEDNESDAY
Gore visits Nicaragua
US vice-president Al Gore visits Nicaragua to attend a summit of central
American presidents focusing on the environment. Central America's six
presidents are to meet in Managua in a bid to strengthen the Alliance for
Sustainable Development, a plan to protect the region's environment while
exploiting its rich natural resources.
UK economy:
Inflation may be low, but judging by gilt yields, investors cannot believe
it will stay that way. However, September's retail prices index, out today,
is expected to show that underlying inflation is still within the lower half
of the government's 1-4 per cent target range.
Aftershock:
A week after an earthquake off Japan's northern island of Hokkaido,
measuring 8.2 on the Richter scale, Tokyo hosts a United Nations public
forum and open lecture by Professor Haresh Shah on why the global earthquake
risk is increasing.
Ukraine president Leonid Kuchma presents his programme to parliament
covering economic and constitutional reform, nuclear arms and Crimea. He
will also ask the assembly to sanction budget cuts in line with an IMF plan.
Saleroom:
A Christie's in London auction of correspondence from the archives of Bowood
House in Wiltshire is expected to raise Pounds 700,000 and includes letters
to the 2nd Earl of Shelburne, who was British prime minister in the 1780s,
from George III, George Washington and Benjamin Franklin.
There are also 15 letters to the earl from the 18th century Scottish
economist Adam Smith, who converted the earl to the doctrine of free trade,
which are expected to fetch more than Pounds 90,000.
Football:
A host of unevenly matched UEFA cup qualifying games takes place today,
including: Ireland v Leichstenstein, and Russia v San Marino.
Rugby:
Wales play Italy in Cardiff in a World Cup qualifying game.
Holidays:
Brazil; Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Uruguay, Venezuela (Columbus Day); Spain.
THURSDAY
Bundesbank council meets
The Bundesbank policy-making central council meets with Sunday's federal
election on its mind, and prices on its agenda. It will contemplate the
potentially inflationary impact of the IG Metall engineering union's 1995
pay claim, due on Tuesday or Wednesday.
A demand for about 6 per cent is expected, but the key question is how hard
the union will press its case. That depends on the election result. The
return of the current government will mean a fight. But if the Social
Democrats win a place in a new coalition, a peaceful and non-inflationary
settlement can be virtually guaranteed.
Singapore hosts a meeting to promote links between Europe and east Asia,
organised by the Singapore Economic Development Board and the Geneva-based
World Economic Forum. Key speakers include Malaysian leader Dr Mahathir
Mohamad and President Fidel Ramos of the Philippines.
Canadian economy:
Federal and provincial finance ministers meet in Toronto ahead of next
week's economic statement by the federal finance minister Paul Martin. That
will set the stage for consultations on his next budget, expected February
1995. Also on the agenda will be debt and deficits, and sales tax reform.
FT Survey: Bulgaria.
Holidays: Hong Kong, India (Bombay only).
FRIDAY
General strike in Italy
Italian trade unions plan a general strike in protest at plans by Silvio
Berlusconi's government to rein in spending and cut pension and health
benefits as part of an austerity budget for 1995. The detail and timing of
the action - originally planned as a four-hour stoppage - could well depend
on the sector and region.
Individual unions and even factories have begun to stage strikes at short
notice over the past fortnight, as the general protest coincides with more
localised attempts to put pressure on employers during the annual round of
wage negotiations.
Stock standard:
Deadline for submissions on the London Stock Exchange's plans to replace the
Unlisted Securities Market, which closes in 1996. Initial reaction to the
Alternative Investment Market from advisers, brokers, bankers and small
company representatives has been favourable.
Portugal's government presents its 1995 budget to parliament. Finance
minister Eduardo Catroga aims to cut inflation to between 3.5 and 4.5 per
cent, keep growth between 2.5 and 3.5 per cent and reduce the deficit from
an original forecast of 6.5 per cent of GDP. Economic growth, which resumed
in the second quarter after a recession in 1993, is now forecast at the
lower end of the government's 1 to 2 per cent target.
FT Survey: International Standards.
WEEKEND
German federal elections
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, hoping to win his fourth election in a row, may
scrape home if the Free Democrats, his junior coalition partner, pick up
last-minute support. Failing that, Kohl's CDU will probably form a grand
coalition with the opposition SPD.
There are also state elections in Thuringia, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and the
Saarland, and municipal elections in North Rhine-Westphalia.
Botswana holds a general election on Saturday.
The Ulster Unionists, Northern Ireland's biggest political party, begin
their annual conference in Carrickfergus on Saturday. The party is the main
moderate unionist voice in the province and its support for the UK-Irish
peace initiative is vital if it is to have a chance of success. Principal
point of interest will be the speech by UUP leader James Molyneaux, expected
to focus on the prospects for devolved government in Ulster.
Finland is expected to vote heavily in favour of European Union membership
in its referendum on Sunday.
Macedonian vote:
The former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia holds a general election and votes
for a president. No party is expected to win an outright majority, but
President Kiro Gligorov should be re-elected.

Monday: UK producer price figures for August showed signs that manufacturers
were starting to pass on raw material price rises to their customers.
September figures are expected to show a further increase in the annual rate
of output price growth to 2.4 per cent.
Wednesday: As well as the September inflation figures, the UK will release
details of September unemployment (expected to have dropped by 20,000) and
August average earnings numbers. The latter have been stuck at 3.75 per cent
for some time; any increase will frighten the gilts market.
Thursday: US producer price figures for September will give further clues to
inflationary pressures in America. Nomura Research Institute expects a 0.2
per cent monthly rise in the headline figure
Friday: A big day for US economic statistics, with the consumer price index,
retail sales and capacity utilisation for September all being published.
Following last Friday's mixed employment report, analysts now expect this
batch of data to determine whether the Federal Reserve decides to tighten
policy further.

Pre-election angst appears to be a condition limited to foreign observers of
the German scene, who parted with their D-Mark investments in increasing
numbers last week as opinion polls suggested a close-run election next
weekend.
German analysts and investors are altogether more phlegmatic. Many weight
the scale heavily in favour of a return to power for Chancellor Helmut Kohl
and his conservative/liberal coalition.
One favoured theory among the not-so-sures is that even if the Social
Democrats come to share power in a grand coalition with the Christian
Democrats and the Christian Social Union, there is no real risk to economic,
monetary or fiscal stability. They argue that, by virtue of its majority in
the powerful upper house of parliament, the SPD is already effectively a
partner in government and law-making.
But the most rousing noises emerged from Deutsche Bank's institutional
investors' team in Dusseldorf on Friday, where they appeared to be putting
out the flags a week early, rating the current coalition with a 70 per cent
chance of returning to power, and promising 'fireworks' if it does.
These would include a gain of up to 300 points in Frankfurt's over-sold DAX
index of 30 leading shares, and a 'powerful rally' in the bond market.

A busy week for the gilts market kicks off with the publication today of the
minutes of the September 7 meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England.
The debate about last month's base rate rise will be closely scrutinised,
with traders obviously interested in clues about future interest rate
policy.
In addition, there is a full menu of statistics in both the UK and the US,
with markets most likely to concentrate on the inflation data on both sides
of the Atlantic.
Many expect recent signs of strong US economic activity to lead to an
increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve this week.
August's inflation data in the UK were rather disappointing; analysts are
hoping that the underlying annual rate will have dropped back to 2.2 per
cent in September, from August's 2.3 per cent. The headline rate is expected
to have stabilised at 2.4 per cent.
On Friday, the Bank of England will announce the stock for the next gilt
auction. Ms Katy Peters, senior economist at Daiwa Europe, is expecting the
Bank to pick an ultra-long stock. 'It's a cheap part of the yield curve,
they haven't issued such stock for a while and there's lots of institutional
demand,' she says.

In spite of last Friday's surprisingly resilient performance by the bond
market, investors are likely to be in an apprehensive mood when trading
reopens tomorrow after the Columbus Day holiday.
The rally in prices - which helped the long bond yield drop back below 8 per
cent after a brief period above that psychologically-important mark - was
prompted by an analysis of the September employment data that judged the
figures to be generally neutral for the Treasury market, and unlikely to
push the Federal Reserve into raising interest rates again.
The analysis came as a relief to investors, who had feared before the jobs
figures were released that they might be so strong as to trigger a monetary
policy tightening.
That relief, however, may prove short-lived. Later this week the September
producer and consumer prices data are published, and any sign of resurgent
inflation may persuade the Fed that another increase in interest rates is
required to slow the economy and restrain inflation.
With this fear in mind, trading is likely to be subdued over the next two
days as investors choose not to commit funds to the market ahead of such
sensitive data. If there is any movement, it could be on the upside, as most
analysts do not expect September inflation figures to be threatening.

FT  10 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bond yields on the Tokyo market rose to a one-month high of 4.77 per cent
last week on expectations of higher short-term money market rates.
The Bank of Japan's neutral stance on the money markets at a time when the
current reserve maintenance period ends this week and US interest rates are
expected to rise, discouraged traders, prompting profit-taking.
Market participants will continue to focus on the Bank of Japan's money
market manoeuvrings this week. The central bank may try to limit a rise in
the overnight call rate if the stock market remains sluggish ahead of the
October 27 Japan Tobacco flotation. Financial officials have become
increasingly concerned over the listing, and are expected to support stock
market volumes.
However, economic data due this week, including machinery orders for August,
and the government's official assessment of the economy, due at the end of
the week, are likely to confirm the ongoing recovery, and may create turmoil
on the bond market.
Bankers are also worried about a rise in short-term interest rates since the
short-term prime rate, the lending rate to first-tier clients, is tied to
three-month certificate of deposit rates, which firmed last week. Banks are
reluctant to raise lending rates when demand for funds among companies is
still weak.

FT  10 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Bears continue to hold sway - Capital
and Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After nine months of bloodletting, the last quarter of this year could be a
bit kinder to international bond fund managers. However, amid continued
worldwide economic growth and expectations of further monetary tightening in
Europe next year, many say any recovery is likely to be little more than a
temporary reprieve in a continuing bear market environment.
'I think there's good scope for a fourth-quarter rally, but I don't think
the bear market is over yet,' says Mr Edward Dove, director of fixed income
at Julius Baer Investments. 'The current level of economic growth is not a
flash in the pan - it's here to stay, and that could be consistent with the
price of capital being pushed higher,' he says.
'On a technical basis, markets do seem oversold - but even if there is a
rebound, helped by subdued economic data, I doubt it's enough to generate a
sizeable rally, given what looms in 1995,' agrees Mr Paul Abberley, head of
fixed income at Lombard Odier, adding: 'We are still positioned defensively
and see upward pressure on yields as economies continue to strengthen.'
Some are more upbeat. 'We are expecting some sort of recovery, though it's
hard to pinpoint the timing,' says Mr Mark Gull, bond fund manager at
Gartmore. 'We feel bond yields are rather high and when confidence - that
rather elusive quality - returns to the market, it will recover.'
The market's troubles began on February 4, when the US Fed raised interest
rates for the first time in the current cycle, highlighting fears of
inflation fuelled by economic growth. Further pressure came from the failure
of US-Japanese trade talks, which undermined the dollar. Both of these
factors triggered heavy selling by highly leveraged bond market players,
causing prices to spiral lower.
In this environment, many investors took refuge on the sidelines, keeping
their exposure to a minimum. But while investor demand for bonds was
shrinking, supply was swelling though the heavy issuance of debt by
governments around the world. All this pushed bond yields to dizzy heights,
where, it was hoped, they would eventually entice investors back into the
market.
Indeed, that now seems to be happening, with dealers reporting cautious
nibbling by investors who have been building up large cash positions in
recent months.
'People have been far too bearish, and we think there is an increasing risk
in being out of these markets,' says Mr Dove. 'Bonds offer very, very good
value at these levels.'
That's especially because - at least in Europe - fears of growth-fuelled
inflation now appear to have been overdone, with some recent data in Germany
and the UK pointing to steady growth accompanied by subdued inflation
pressures.
'The inflationary implications of the economic recovery have been grossly
exaggerated by the market,' says Mr Robert Kyprianou, chief investment
officer at Kidder Peabody Asset Management.
While growth will remain intact and short-term rates are likely to rise,
tightening will not be as drastic as bond market players have been assuming,
he argues. 'The current risk premiums are too high; as time passes and
confidence returns, prices will recover slowly but surely,' he predicts.
Some feel it will take specific developments, like clear signs of US
economic slowdown or a resumption of buying by Japanese investors, to
jump-start bonds. Others say it is simply a matter of time, with cash and
confidence returning to the market as the inflation spectre becomes less
daunting.
When it comes to picking their favourite market, fund managers are nearly
unanimous in their enthusiasm for UK gilts.
Gilts - this year's worst performing bond market - last week rallied
sharply, partly on switching out of German bunds ahead of the October 16
elections, but mainly due to a reassessment of the fundamental picture. This
caused the yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt to drop some 15 basis points
to 8.71 per cent on Friday, with the yield gap over Germany shrinking to 118
basis points from 148 the previous week.
'We are overweight gilts in our global bond funds and happy to stay that
way,' says Mr Gull at Gartmore. 'We don't see many inflationary pressures;
the UK is politically stable; the pre-emptive base rate hike underlines the
UK's commitment to controlling inflation; the PSBR is on a clearly defined
downward path and the improving trade balance is supportive of sterling,' he
lists.
Depending on the outcome of the German elections, Germany's is another bond
market that may offer good value. If Chancellor Helmut Kohl returns to power
and his government's planned fiscal tightening measures are introduced early
next year, bund yields could benefit substantially; indeed, some are calling
for yields of 6.75 per cent by mid-1995, from current levels around 7.72 per
cent.

FT  10 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Syndicated loans return to favour -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heavy with capital and hungry for new assets, many banks have become very
eager to start lending again - and have turned aggressively to the market
for syndicated loans.
This sector of the international capital market allows banks to participate
to varying degrees in a loan to a borrower.
The loan is usually arranged by one or two lead banks but an unlimited
number of banks can contribute to the loan, enabling them to generate income
while at the same time sharing the risk with other lenders.
Banks have repaired the damage done to their balance sheets by the bad debts
of the late 1980s and many of the loans granted at the end of the last
decade are now close to maturity.
'There is a vast amount of liquidity in the syndicated loans market at the
moment, mainly because banks have a shortage of assets,' said Mr Martyn
Powell, vice-president and head of syndication origination at UBS in London.
As a result, there has been fierce competition among banks for new loan
business, often from reluctant borrowers who still have painful memories of
the difficulties which arose from excessive borrowing during the last
recession.
This has driven the cost of the loan to borrowers down to extremely low
levels. Over the past year, the spread over Libor on a syndicated loan to a
typical European corporate borrower, with a Single A credit rating, has
dropped from about 45 basis points to around 20 to 22 basis points. The
interest rate on a syndicated loan is usually set at a 'spread' or margin
over Libor, the benchmark interest rate for the market.
Many borrowers, however, faced with such a low cost of borrowing and
deterred from entering the bond markets by the current painfully high
yields, have begun to turn back to the syndicated loans market as an
alternative source of funds.
'Pricing is down to levels where the loans market is very competitive with
the bond market,' said Mr Powell. 'Borrowers are now closely examining both
options, and in many instances the loan market is turning out to be the most
attractive to them.'
He added: 'As prices (continue to) fall, the (volume of deals) will pick up.
Corporate treasurers are looking at the bank market and realising there is
an opportunity there.'
Most regions of the world have been witness to this growth in syndicated
loans this year, although recently Scandinavia in particular has seen a
marked pick-up in activity, sparked by a dramatic fall in pricing spreads.
'A significant number of Scandinavian borrowers with existing transactions
have been watching the market closely and have decided now is the time to
refinance or reprice their existing deals,' said one syndicate manager.
Mr Powell said: 'A Scandinavian borrower would have had to pay 25 to 30
basis points (over Libor) for a five-year loan at the end of the 1980s; two
years ago he would have paid 60 to 70 basis points. But now we have come
back almost full circle to a price of 25 to 30 basis points (over Libor).'
Both Televerket of Norway and Vattenfall of Sweden have been able to come to
the syndicated loan market this year and secure loans priced at around 19
basis points over Libor, whereas last year they were forced to pay around 40
basis points over Libor.
'Scandinavia suffered a deep recession which caused a lot of problems for
companies and as a result it was out of bounds for many banks for a long
time,' said one syndicate manager. 'Now it is back in favour and many
companies are taking advantage of the opportunity.'
Rumours swept the market last week that Securum, the Swedish state-owned
company, is considering a SKr20bn syndicated loan to refinance outstanding
debt. 'Something of that volume could have a dramatic impact on pricing,'
said one syndicate official.
The syndicated loans seen in Scandinavia have tended to be large, 'jumbo'
financings of around at least Dollars 500m. In Norway, for example, Phillips
Petroleum Company is currently involved in a Dollars 500m syndicated loan,
which is also interesting because of its relatively long maturity of seven
years. As well as price, many banks have been prepared to sacrifice maturity
and other terms and conditions on loans in their attempts to win business.
It is also no longer the case that only borrowers with high credit ratings
have access to syndicated loans with low spreads and favourable terms.
Increasingly, competition between banks is blurring the difference between
the higher and lower quality borrowers.
'Why are banks doing this? Because the loans are relationship-driven,' said
one banker in London. 'The asset itself is not the only reason for doing the
transaction - banks will lend where they see opportunities for doing other
business.'
Southern Europe, including Spain, Greece and Italy, is a region which has
also seen a marked increase in syndicated loan activity. This is probably
linked to the fact these countries' bond markets have suffered particularly
badly in this year's bear market.
The Kingdom of Spain recently borrowed Ecu6bn over five years at a spread of
just 4 1/2 basis points over Libor. The Kingdom of Italy is also rumoured to
be considering a syndicated loan.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Fund managers turn to fledgling Arab
bourses - The Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROULA KHALAF and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Iraq's manoeuvrings, raising fears of another invasion of Kuwait, coincide
awkwardly with the latest initiative from fund managers with a taste for
developing countries, who are attempting to sell the Middle East as the last
frontier for emerging markets investment.
Having watched returns in Asia and Latin America slip earlier this year, the
professionals have turned to a clutch of fledgling Arab bourses.
Three funds have been launched since June, and another three are waiting to
take off in the next two months - the Framlington Egypt Fund, the Foreign &amp;
Colonial Emerging Middle East Fund and the Fleming Arab Countries Fund. In
all, fund managers may have raised as much as Dollars 270m this year to
invest in the region.
Long constrained by political turmoil and strict government economic
controls, the Middle East and North Africa got short shrift during last
winter's emerging markets investment boom. Of Dollars 52bn in cross-border
equity flows invested in emerging markets worldwide in 1993, a mere 0.4 per
cent went into the Arab markets, according to Baring Securities.
No-one is bracing for a Mideast 'miracle' and the political risk, as
evidenced by Iraq's threatening moves this week, remains high. But with the
peace process in full swing, the Arab boycott crumbling, the World Bank
forecasting real regional GDP growth of 3.8 per cent a year in the coming
decade, and most countries successful graduates of the IMF's liberalisation
policies, fund managers are eager to cash in.
The International Finance Corporation's emerging markets index was down by
8.5 per cent in the first half of this year, while all Arab markets - with
the exception of the more mature bourse in Amman - shot up. 'The overall
idea is that these countries can't go right and left, either you eat in the
hands of the IMF or you don't eat at all,' said Mr Mohamad Mourabet, fund
manager at Fleming Investment Management.
The rush to the Middle East began earlier this year when the Omani
government, seeking to boost the Muscat Stock Exchange but rein in
volatility - only 70 stocks are listed for a total capitalisation of Dollars
2bn - approached Blakeney about setting up a country fund with the exclusive
licence to invest on the bourse.
The Dollars 52m closed-end Oryx Fund, launched in June and jointly managed
by Blakeney and the Oman National Insurance company, has already invested 70
per cent of its funds and expects to be fully invested before the end of the
year. Listed in London, the fund recently traded at about Pounds 7, a slight
premium to net asset value.
The Muscat bourse was up 17 per cent in the first half of the year. Now,
says Mr Abdel Majeed, who manages Oryx, Blakeney is planning another fund to
invest in unlisted securities in the Middle East and Africa.
Also in June, the US's Salomon Brothers Asset Management and Morocco's
Omnium Nord Africain launched the first Morocco country fund, worth Dollars
52m. The fund will start trading next year, when it is fully invested, on an
exchange yet to be determined.
Next came the Maghreb Fund in September. Framlington Investment Management,
a unit of CCF of France, raised Dollars 30.5m from institutional investors
and the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private sector
arm, to invest in Tunisia and Morocco. The closed-end fund trades in Dublin.
Bolstered by the success of the Maghreb Fund, Framlington announced last
week its intention to raise another Dollars 30m at the end of October to
invest in Egyptian securities.
Other fund managers are taking a more regional approach. Foreign &amp; Colonial,
the UK fund management group, is marketing a Dollars 60m closed-end fund for
emerging Middle East markets. At least 65 per cent of the fund is to be
invested in equities of five core markets - Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan
and Oman - with the remainder placed in neighbouring countries, mainly
Turkey and Israel, and fixed income instruments.
Fleming Investment Management, meanwhile, is focusing on Arab markets only.
Fleming is 'considering' launching a Dollars 50m closed-end fund
concentrating on Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco, but expecting also to
invest in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and Lebanon. Expected to be launched by the
end of November, the fund will be listed in London.
However, it is still early in the game. First, the region may burst into
conflict again, driving countries to redirect resources into defence at the
expense of economic development. Second, only five markets in the region -
Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Oman and Tunisia - allow foreign investment, and
this in varying degrees. Tunisia, for example, requires authorisation for
every investment; thus, every purchase or sale may take up to a week.
Oman, which had granted Oryx the exclusive right to channel foreign capital
into the Muscat Stock Exchange, has informed other fund managers that they
will be allowed to buy selected stocks, while Lebanon is set to open the
Beirut bourse this year and promises open access to foreigners.
Bahrain, which has 64 listed stocks, allows foreigners to invest in only
four companies. Saudi Arabia boasts the largest stock market in the region
with a healthy Dollars 42bn capitalisation, but it is not expected to open
to foreign capital before 1997.
These markets are also, for the most part, extremely illiquid. Morocco's
Bourse des Valeurs, which offers the most promising prospects in the region,
has a market capitalisation of Dollars 4.2bn and average monthly turnover of
Dollars 60m. The Tunis stock exchange trades daily between 10 and 11am and,
with 20 listed stocks, has a market capitalisation of less than Dollars 2bn.
Average monthly turnover is Dollars 14m.
Fund managers, of course, are all too happy to get in before the markets
expand or be ready to enter when more markets open up. They are pinning
their hopes on big privatisation programmes planned in most of these
markets.
Predictably, some programmes are moving faster than others, with the
Egyptian one bogged down in bureaucracy. According to LCF Edmond de
Rothschild Securities in London, lead manager of the Framlington Egypt Fund,
the IMF has delayed the last of a series of Egyptian debt write-offs to
pressure the government into action on the privatisation front. A more
promising programme is taking place in Morocco, where the government last
year selected 112 companies to sell off for a total of Dollars 2.2bn, and
was able to raise Dollars 250m in 1993.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Greece gears up for telecoms flotation -
International offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-awaited flotation of OTE, the Greek state telecoms monopoly, is
finally taking shape, with the government hoping to raise more than Dr320bn
(Dollars 1.3bn) from selling 25 per cent of the company to domestic and
overseas investors at the end of November.
As some 18 per cent of the company's equity will be placed with institutions
abroad, OTE's management is gearing up for road-shows around Europe, the US
and Japan. CS First Boston and Schroders, global co-ordinators for the
issue, are managing an underwriting syndicate of 10 investment banks that
includes Lehman Brothers, S. G. Warburg and Yamaichi of Japan.
To boost investors' confidence in the offering, Mr Yannos Papantoniou, the
economy minister and architect of Greece's revised privatisation programme,
will be on hand for OTE's presentations in London and New York.
Doubts remain to be dispelled after last year's attempt to dispose of 49 per
cent of OTE, plus management rights, fell through as a result of political
wrangling and fierce opposition from the company's trade union.
This time, the government is treading more carefully, pledging that OTE will
remain under state management, but as one official put it: 'It's going to
operate like any private Greek corporation.'
New legislation due to be approved by parliament in the next two weeks
provides for substantive price rises for local calls so that OTE's domestic
network can break even by 1997. The company's pension obligations, another
drain on earnings, are to be capped at Dr11bn a year and it will stop
subsidising ELTA, the loss-making Greek postal service, at the end of 1994.
Last year, OTE reported pre-tax profits of Dr129bn on turnover of Dr389bn.
Earnings forecasts for 1994 are buoyant, thanks to the expansion of card
phones, which are bringing in over Dr10bn a month in new revenue.
However, analysts agree the question of management will affect the price of
the offering, to be determined by a three-week book-building exercise among
overseas investors. Mr Victor Pisante of Telesis Capital says: 'The
commitment to state management is likely to have a negative effect on
pricing. To protect its future, OTE needs to make a strategic alliance, like
other European telecoms operators are doing.'
OTE officials are reluctant to give details of their business plan before
the new law goes through. But they are already hiring foreign executives to
handle marketing and new product development.
OTE also plans to enter Greece's fast-growing mobile telephony market,
preferably by acquiring a stake in one of the country's two GSM (Global
System for Mobile Communications) operators, Telestet, controlled by Stet of
Italy, and Panafon, in which Vodafone of the UK has a sizeable holding.
The issue's domestic tranche will require careful handling, given the limits
on liquidity at the Athens bourse. After some Dr15bn of the offering is
stripped out for sale at a discount to OTE employees and pensioners, shares
worth about Dr75bn will be offered to domestic investors.
However, this would still be triple the amount raised in Greece's largest
public offering to date. To ensure as wide a share distribution as possible,
National Bank of Greece, which is managing the domestic tranche, is expected
to include almost all the country's 20 banks in its underwriting syndicate.
The government will also be trying to ensure the success of the flotation by
launching an advertising campaign aimed at attracting small investors.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: State of grace may prove fleeting - New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street may have had a lucky break with last week's employment figures.
But concerns over interest rates are still lurking just below the surface as
the quarterly results season gets under way this week.
'It's going to be a classic tug of war between rising interest rates and
superlative earnings,' says Mr Steven Einhorn, head of equity research at
Goldman Sachs in New York.
The stage was set on Friday, when the jobs data proved to be inconclusive.
Still, after so much hand-wringing ahead of the report, there was enough
mollifying news to allow equity investors to squint at the awkward bits.
In the end, it was the realisation that the Federal Reserve would not put up
interest rates immediately that carried the day and averted the hammering
which many had feared.
The headline figure - a weaker than expected gain of 239,000 in non-farm
payrolls - caused the Fed to hold its fire, at least until after considering
this week's flood of economic reports.
As a result, bonds improved and stocks appreciated after a week of steady
declines.
Friday's state of grace, if it can be characterised as such, may prove
fleeting. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond is just a shade
below the 8.00 per cent level, a red flag for investors.
'The likelihood of the long bond yield moving above 8.00 per cent and of
staying there increases the more the Fed delays,' say J. P. Morgan analysts
in their October market briefing.
With a sixth interest rate increase looming: 'Wouldn't it be nice if the
market could focus on earnings?' asks Mr Hugh Johnson, chief investment
officer at First Albany. He is not alone in the opinion that many companies
will show solid improvement for the quarter.
Mr Johnson goes a little further than some in predicting plenty of pleasant
surprises, based on stronger than expected exports by US companies to
recovering European markets. 'That will be good for stocks provided we don't
get blind-sided by bad inflation or interest rate news,' he says.
He sees the September data on producer and consumer prices, due out at the
end of the week, as the key. He expects both inflation readings to be tame,
allowing the bond market to stabilise, or even improve. 'If that proves to
be the case, then the stock market could focus on what really counts and we
could move higher,' says Mr Johnson.
Mr Einhorn is less certain, however. 'My sense is that the market will
remain stuck for the next month or two,' the Goldman Sachs analyst says. 'It
will have some upward bias but it will be constrained in that bias by the
level and likely direction of short-term interest rates.'

External factors will continue to direct trading this week, although brokers
reckon that after a 1,000-point correction in the Hang Seng index from the
recent highs, the downside is now limited, writes Louise Lucas.
Investors will start the week by digesting Friday's US unemployment figures
with any signs of a rise in US interest rates proving negative, since such
increases feed through to the colony.
A second focus will be the health of China's paramount leader, Deng
Xiaoping, whose rumoured death spooked both the domestic China markets and
Hong Kong for much of last week.
On Friday, Shanghai's A index, of shares available only to local investors,
fell by almost 18 per cent at one stage, prompting the foreign ministry to
issue a statement assuring investors that Deng was in fine health. This
prompted a late rebound which left the index to close 12.4 per cent higher
on the day. However, the statement will do little to allay fears if Deng
remains hidden from public view.

With fears of over-supply easing in the wake of strong demand for the
Matsushita Electric Industrial convertible bond and the Japan Tobacco issue,
investors are expected to start small-lot buying again, writes Emiko
Terazono.
Market participants are expected to focus on JT subscriptions, with shares
not taken up by successful investors in the lottery being allocated in a
second round on Friday.
Corporate earnings revision announcements are expected to continue
throughout the week, and companies with strong upward revisions may see
buying.
However, profit-taking is expected to appear above the 20,000 level, and
traders expect the Nikkei index to fluctuate between 19,500 and 21,000.

A busy week is in store with eight-month results. Bergesen, Norway's largest
shipowner, which reported a steep fall in pre-tax profits for the first four
months, reports on Wednesday. Thursday brings figures from Norsk Skog, the
forestry group, and Friday sees details from Kvaerner, Europe's biggest
shipbuilder and Norway's second largest stock market listed company, which
increased pre-tax profits by 36 per cent in the first four months of 1994
against the same period a year earlier.
Mr Thomas Wold at Enskilda Corporate points out that the Norwegian market's
sluggish performance this year has left it down about 3.5 per cent, although
it has outperformed Europe, excluding the UK, by close to 7.7 per cent.
He expects the market to continue weak for another couple of months but
thinks it has the potential to resume a positive trend towards the end of
the year and into 1995.
The substantial uncertainty about the outcome of the EU referendum on
November 28 is holding back investment in the stock market and has added a
political risk premium to interest rates, he says. However resolution of the
issue, with Sweden and Finland also voting in favour, would have a positive
effect on interest rates and the stock market.

Third-quarter sales figures are due from Ciba on Wednesday ahead of Roche's
figures next Monday.
Analysts are forecasting a satisfactory set of figures from Ciba, with a 4
per cent rise in sales in local currency terms translating into a 1 per cent
fall in Swiss francs, with the continuing strength of the domestic currency
still taking a toll.
This is, however, unlikely to deflect investors from their main
preoccupation and further sounds of the growing battle for influence between
UBS and Mr Martin Ebner's BK Vision will be eagerly awaited, ahead of the
EGM called for November 22 to discuss the bank's proposed share
restructuring.
Merrill Lynch expects UBS management, in all probability, to carry the vote,
but says BK Vision is likely to challenge the move in the courts as well as
at the meeting.
It describes the situation as confused and says both the registered and
bearer classes of stock have been driven substantially above fundamental
value.
'Although resolution may be some way off, we think that any solution to the
dispute will lead to a sharp fall in the price of both stock classes. There
is more money to be lost than made here and we remain sellers,' it says.

Thursday's Bundesbank meeting and next Sunday's federal election dominate a
volatile market. Few expect the Bundesbank to change rates. James Capel says
the weakness of the August industrial production and orders data largely
reflected seasonal problems. It believes that the German recovery remains
robust.
UBS notes that the polls suggest the present CDU/CSU-FDP government of
Chancellor Kohl holds a slender lead. In the event of his re-election, it
expects 'a significant relief factor to be manifested in the markets'.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Dollar stays focus of market attention -
Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Following last Friday's inconclusive US employment report, the market will
this week focus on US inflation, retail sales and industrial production data
to get a sense of when the Fed will next raise interest rates.
With US three month money trading at about 5.62 per cent, compared to a Fed
funds rate presently of 4.75 per cent, the market clearly believes it is a
question of when, rather than if, rates next rise.
Most observers believe that early Fed action is required to stabilise the US
bond market. Without this, there seems little chance of a recovery in the
dollar, given the close link between bonds and the dollar in recent months.
The outlook against the yen, however, is more encouraging. The dollar
finished on Friday above Y100 for the first time in five weeks. It was the
beneficiary of the recent US-Japan trade agreement, and renewed tensions
surrounding Iraq, which could hurt the yen.
Technical analysis suggests the dollar may have broken upwards against the
yen, and recent price behaviour confirms that the market may be trying to
take the dollar higher.
Traders will also be forced this week to don their political hats. Both
German national elections and the Finnish referendum on joining the EU take
place on Sunday.
If Chancellor Kohl is re-elected with a workable coalition, this should
support the D-Mark. Anything less, and the D-Mark will be vulnerable, with
the Swiss franc, and possibly sterling, likely to benefit.
The Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday is not expected to produce a move
in rates, though the IG Metall pay claim could hasten the next tightening if
it threatens the inflation outlook.
A referendum victory in Finland would probably buoy all Nordic currencies,
though they remain vulnerable to setbacks until the Swedish and Norwegian EU
votes, next month, are also out of the way.
Elsewhere, sentiment toward the Italian lira is likely to remain nervous
while the standoff between the government and the Milan magistrates
persists.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Poor start to final quarter deepens gloom -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spread of forecasts by City analysts for the FT-SE 100 Share Index on
December 31 has widened to astonishing proportions as a poor start to the
final quarter has deepened the market's gloom. Fund managers are at present
invited to place their faith in a range of Footsie forecasts between 2,840 -
well, 2,200 if we really want to get bearish - and 3,600.
Such a wide spread suggests that the stock market is becoming a victim of
its own nervousness. Shares are still reacting very sharply to the slightest
hint of discomfort at the Federal Reserve and the futures markets continue
to throw the underlying equities around as if individual companies were no
longer of any significance.
Nor is there much sign that this week will fare any better. Markets have to
face a barrage of important economic data both at home and in the US, with
the regular meeting of the Bundesbank policy council thrown in for good
measure. And then analysts can brace themselves for the UK Budget scheduled
for late November.
However, there is still a strong bullish tendency in the UK market, willing
and able to defend Footsie year-end targets in the 3,400 area. Technical
factors in the market are by no means entirely negative. UK bonds, the
recognised key to an equity recovery, have remained relatively steady, and
there was a passive response to Friday's much-dreaded US payroll numbers.
Derivative Securities, which tracks trends from the viewpoint of the futures
markets, has repeated its belief that the UK stock market remains 'very
oversold,' and that support levels are very close, indicating that further
downside appears fairly limited.
Trading volumes, while not exciting, have not been as poor as painted in
some quarters. Retail business remains steadily above Pounds 1bn a day, and
the fall-off in private investor business is no threat to big securities
firms. The problems for market-makers have come from the risks of taking on
trading programmes in these troubled times.
These risks have fed through to the stock index futures market, where the
unwillingness of the big institutions to play has left power and influence
in the hands of the independent traders, the locals, who now stand accused,
not for the first time, of being able and willing to move share prices at
will.
Experience would suggest that the market cannot be manipulated over anything
but a very short time-span. If the bond market turns, then all the arguments
about corporate earnings growth of nearly 50 per cent between 1994 and 1996,
enabling companies to raise dividends by around 10 per cent in each of the
next two years, will be back in focus.
But first we have to survive this week's economic data.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors in emerging markets have been warned that while prices could
advance by a comparatively modest 20 per cent over the next six to 12
months, a substantial setback was likely to follow.
Mr David Shaw, strategy director at Legal &amp; General Investment Management,
said that the trigger was likely to be an increase in US short-term interest
rates to the critical 6 per cent level, which would prompt selling by
private US investors and mutual funds.
'While there continues to be a compelling, secular case for emerging
markets, the purely cyclical justification is near the end of its shelf
life,' said Mr Shaw, who advised taking profits when the IFC Composite
Investable index breached the 400 level.
PAKISTAN
Hub Power Company, which is building a 1,292MW plant near Karachi, is to
issue shares worth Rs8.17bn (Dollars 266 million) to foreign and domestic
investors. The prospectus was due to be published last Saturday and the
one-day subscription for next Sunday. The offer price was said to be Rs13.26
but, in the kerb market, shares were trading at Rs18.50.
POLAND
Creditanstalt Bankverein of Austria plans to create a Polish investment fund
with a domestic partner. A local representative said that the open-ended
fund would mainly invest in papers available on the Polish market, including
government bonds and companies listed on the Warsaw stock exchange but that,
if permitted, management would also like to make some foreign investments.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Iraqi moves unnerve Israelis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Uneasiness in Israel over the latest developments in Iraq and Kuwait left
the Tel Aviv equity market's blue chip Mishtanim index down 3.68, or 2 per
cent yesterday at 182.58. Turnover stayed low at Shk137m, Shk10m higher than
last Thursday's figure.
In Kuwait itself, brokers sold shares on Saturday on news of Iraqi troop
movements north of the border, but volume remained slim and the index fell
by just 11 points, or 1.1 per cent to 956. Here, turnover was 2.7m dinars
against 1.3m dinars last Wednesday. The reaction was similar in Jordan where
the Amman general price index fell 1.47, or 1 per cent to 144.36.
In Morocco, meanwhile, geographically far removed from the Iraq/Kuwait
border, brokers on Saturday were complaining mainly about a lack of
liquidity in the market.

FT  10 OCT 94 / The Markets: London hosts metals jamboree - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world metal trade and its entourage will be in London this week for the
London Metal Exchange's annual jamboree.
As dealers, analysts and industry executives mingle at lunches, conferences,
seminars and, of course, tomorrow's LME annual dinner, a frequent topic of
conversation is sure to be the recent surge in the prices of most metals -
can it be maintained, especially if the investment fund money that played a
large part in fuelling it is attracted elsewhere?
'The underlying force for the climb in metal prices is demand from
end-users, as is shown by the premiums being paid for certain types of metal
in certain places,' Mr David King, the LME chief executive, told the Reuters
news agency last week.
Some senior LME traders are concerned, however, about the growing influence
of the investment funds. 'These funds owe no loyalty to commodities,' one
pointed out. 'They could bring instability to the market when they try and
take profits'.
But that view was not shared by Mr King. 'It would be dangerous,' he
suggested, 'to exaggerate the importance of fund investment in driving
prices higher.'
LME Week gets under way today with the start of a two-day conference on the
metal industry of the former Soviet Union and a lunch given by the American
Metal Market publication.
The London-based Metal Bulletin magazine holds a seminar tomorrow on the
role of investment activity in base metals markets. And in the evening,
guests at the LME annual dinner will hear speeches by Mr Raj Bagri, the
exchange's board chairman, and Mr Juan Villarzu, president of Codelco,
Chile's state-owned metals and mining concern.
The fun continues on Wednesday with a Japanese Metal Mining Agency forum and
a presentation by Magma Copper, the US company that last week made the
winning bid in the auction sale of Tintaya, Peru's second biggest copper
mine.

FT  10 OCT 94 / The Markets: The invisible hand - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The invisible hand has been at work again in the Japanese stock market. Not
the one identified by Adam Smith, but a rather less dextrous instrument, the
far-from-gentle touch of Finance Ministry officials attempting to prop up
share prices as the market threatens another slide.
Traders first noticed it a few weeks ago, spotting an unusual renewal of
buying interest in the market on the part of public fund managers as the
Nikkei 225 dipped towards 19,500. This week they appeared to be at it again.
The authorities' target is immediate and specific. On October 27, 436,666
shares in the privatised Japan Tobacco will be offered to the public, the
largest equity issue this year. Since the share price was announced at a
staggeringly high Y1.4m (Dollars 14,220) last month, the market has been
overwhelmed by fears that the issue will flop. That would not only be yet
another disaster for the government's privatisation programme, but would
deal a sizeable blow to stock market confidence just as the collapse of JR
East last October sent the market into a three-month tailspin that saw it
decline by 20 per cent.
Concern about a repeat performance seemed misplaced last month when it was
announced that 8m investors had oversubscribed the offer by a multiple of
50. But the time lag between that initial application and the issue itself,
together with Japan's rather odd rules on tenders, have heightened the sense
of alarm.
The applications already made were merely tentative. Under listing rules,
those who have applied have until tomorrow to pay for the shares. If they do
not like the look of the stock closer to the impact day, investors can
simply let their applications lapse by not stumping up. At the end of last
week, brokers offices in and around Tokyo were alive with rumours that the
number of applicants who had not paid was running at about 75 per cent.
Many investors appear to be running scared of the general malaise that has
gripped the market in the last month. They have also learned a salutary
lesson from another bungled offering - last month's Japan Telecom debacle,
where the shares are now trading at nearly 20 per cent below the offer
price. So the authorities have turned to intervention to shore up the market
and avert a catastrophe.
But these attempts to buy temporary stability in the run-up to the issue
will probably come to nought. If the issue goes better than seems probable,
the intervention will presumably stop, since the listing will be safely
away. The market will then be free to resume its downward path. If, on the
other hand, the worst fears are confirmed, the shock to confidence is likely
to be so great that the weight of adverse sentiment will punch right through
the government's support level.
In other words the real problem is not in fact the price of the issue, nor
the circumstances of its listing, though once again these could have been
better handled, but the simple fact that the market is in no mood to absorb
this massive injection of equity. The JT cash call of about Y960bn comes on
top of a succession of convertible bond issues in the next few weeks that
may take another Y400bn. With average daily trading values at not much
higher than Y250bn, this is an impossible burden for investors to bear.
Individuals, on whom most hopes for equity market recovery are pinned, have
been heavy net sellers in the last few months, in advance of the JT listing.
That is likely to get worse. According to Mr Jason James, chief equity
strategist at James Capel Pacific: 'Individuals may not stabilise until
November - by which time the performance of Japan Tobacco is likely to have
put some of them off.'
Of course, none of this necessarily means the market will repeat its slump
of a year ago. The coming half-year reporting season is expected to help
prices. But these supply-driven difficulties, by dealing a further blow to
individual investor sentiment, have probably postponed yet again a lasting
recovery for Japanese equities.
Interest Rates
Amid the mayhem, the economy continues to emerge from its permafrost
recession at a suitably glacial pace. Second quarter gross domestic product
figures came as a rude shock to some analysts who had hoped to see the first
quarter's rapid growth sustained. That was never likely though, since the
first three months' figures were themselves inflated by a sharp downward
revision to the previous quarter's data.
This confusing roller-coaster picture is not a true and fair representation
of the economy's performance, of course. The longer term, more reliable
figures suggest first half growth of about 0.4 per cent, which should mean
full-year growth for 1994 of a little below 1 per cent, picking up speed to
perhaps 2.5 per cent next year.
This would be a painfully slow recovery even by British standards, but by
Japanese experience it is almost imperceptible. All the less reason then for
the bond bears to continue to dominate as they have - yields rose this week
close to the 5 per cent level. The discount rate has now been held at the
historically low 1.75 per cent for more than a year and the steeper yield
curve suggests that the market is expecting an increase in short term rates
soon. It would be unwise to count on it.
Bond yields shot up in the first half of the year along with those in the
rest of the world. However, in Japan, the strong recovery on which that
increase was predicated has not materialised, but yields have yet to adjust
accordingly.
All the inflation data points to stable or falling prices - unemployment
continues to rise; figures last week that showed the first fall in nominal
incomes for 44 years; and the yen stays stubbornly high  - suggesting that
monetary conditions should be tight enough even for the most predatory
inflation hawk. Indeed, should the recovery continue to show scant sign of
strengthening, another cut in the discount rate should not be ruled out.
What is more, a new governor of the Bank of Japan will take office in
December. It is difficult to imagine that he could be tougher on inflation
than Mr Yasushi Mieno, the current incumbent, who raised interest rates
three times within eight months of taking office four years ago, bringing
down the curtain on the unlamented bubble economy, but bringing with it
Japan's longest postwar recession. His successor is not likely to emulate
that.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Economics Notebook: Criminal flexibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour party leader, has pleased voters and academics
alike by promising to be tough on crime, and on its labour market causes.
His two-sided approach was well captured by the reference to an 'unemployed
youngster' stealing a radio in last week's speech at the party conference.
But experience in the US shows that the link between unemployment and crime
should be handled with care.
That there is a relationship between the two certainly fits with most
people's basic intuitions. Time being the Devil's Hand Maiden, it 'stands to
reason' that young people with nothing to do are more likely to commit
crimes than those who spend their days at work.
Some of the same bar-stool wisdom accounts for the abiding popularity of the
'lock 'em up' rhetoric more likely to feature at this week's Conservative
party conference. Other things equal, it seems obvious that crime would
fall, if only criminally inclined individuals were given less opportunity to
commit crimes. The only difference is whether you think 24-hour supervision
is the answer, or merely nine-to-five.
Other things are not equal, of course. Most people recognise that a complex
web of personal and cultural factors will determine whether a given
individual is one of the small minority who would consider turning to crime.
But these do not lend themselves to clear policy prescriptions. More prison
sentences, or more jobs, tends to emerge as the basic choice.
A report published last week by Leicester University's Centre for the Study
of Public Order comes out firmly in favour of a focus on employment. The
author, Professor John Bunyon, admits that the relationship between
unemployment and crime is complex. Nevertheless, he believes it is
'undeniable' that the increase in long term youth unemployment is a
principal cause of rising crime in the UK. As long as ministers refuse to
accept this, he says, law and order policy will be condemned to 'just
dealing with the symptoms of crime', not its underlying causes.
The trouble is that, by focusing on employment alone, policymakers might
make just the same mistake. A recent paper* on crime trends in the US, by
Professor Richard Freeman, a Harvard economist, finds that while labour
market developments have played an important role in the country's crime
problems, unemployment is only one piece of the puzzle.
As in the UK, sending many more people to prison does not seem to have
reduced crime. The US prison population soared during the 1980s. Since young
men account for the majority of offenders, the effect on that chunk of the
population has been staggering. For men aged between 18 and 34, some 11 per
cent of the workforce was in prison or on parole in 1993. For black men in
the same age group, the proportion is one third.
As the author points out, one would expect this to have had some effect on
the crime rate, if only by removing from society large numbers of proven
criminals. And yet, as the chart shows, the trend-rise in recorded crimes,
at best, stabilised over the period. 'The bottom line is that the propensity
of the non-institutional population to commit crimes must have risen sharply
in the 1980s.'
Labour market trends can explain much of the increase. In essence, the
returns to legal employment fell, relative to the returns to crime, for many
young US males, just as the long term costs of getting caught - and landing
in jail - grew considerably higher.
Part of the decline in labour market opportunities for young men shows up in
high unemployment. Like their counterparts in the UK, young people in the US
suffer more unemployment than the rest of the population. Roughly 15 per
cent of teenagers are out of work, compared with about 6 per cent of adults.
Does this mean that rising crime can be traced to a shortage of jobs?
Reviewing the evidence, Prof Freeman concludes that there is a positive
relation between joblessness and crime. But, unlike the UK, there has not
been a long term rise in US unemployment large enough to explain the
exponential rise in crime.
By and large, the job market problem which has helped raise crime in the US
is not so much a lack of jobs, but a lack of good jobs. Young people in the
US may be frequently jobless, but only a small part of youth unemployment is
long term.
Young people are eligible for very little state unemployment support, and
tend to move in and out of different jobs over the course of a year. This
kind of employment flexibility has long been a feature of the US job market.
What has changed dramatically is the wages young workers are offered. Recent
US Census Data shows that one half of 18 to 24 year-olds working full-time
earned less than the official poverty line in 1992.
About half of young offenders tend to have been employed at the time they
were arrested. Crime can provide a supplement to low income for the employed
and unemployed alike.
In the long run, of course, crime rarely pays, especially now that the
chances of being sent to prison are so much higher. Prof Freeman finds that
a spell in prison has a large effect on offenders' future employment
prospects.
But as long as working pays so little, crime has considerable short-term
attractions for young unskilled men, even if they have a job. In short,
being tough on crime, and tough on unemployment, has not been enough.

FT  10 OCT 94 / International Company News: Aker warns of lower full-year
earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Aker, the Norwegian oil and gas technology and cement and building materials
group, has announced weaker results for the first eight months of the year
and warned of a lower annual profit.
Group pre-tax profit slipped to NKr358m (Dollars 53.45m) from NKr526m as
sales dipped to NKr11bn from NKr11.9bn. Operating profit fell to NKr441m
from NKr518m. The result was in line with analysts' expectations, however.
The decline was due to a lower activity in oil and gas technology -
particularly by Norwegian Contractors (NC) and Aker Engineering - which will
post a significantly lower result in 1994. Aker also warned of weaker
offshore activities in 1995.
NC faces a substantial reduction in business due to changes in market
conditions and will cut the number of its employees to 300 in 1995 from
2,000.
Domestic and international cement and building materials markets are
experiencing growth - after a four-year lull - which will improve the
division's 1994 result.
'Even though the upturn is modest, this has a significant impact on profits
as a result of restructuring and cost-efficiency measures undertaken by Aker
in recent years,' it explained.
The cement and building materials division achieved sales of NKr4.16bn
against NKr3.91bn as pre-tax profit rose to NKr211m from NKr191m. Aker
expects the improvement to continue.
The oil and gas technology division's sales fell to NKr6.39bn from NKr7.48bn
as pre-tax profit declined to NKr156m from NKr343m.
At the end of the eight-month period, the division's order book stood at
NKr6.4bn, down from NKr10bn at the end of 1993, due to lower activity in the
domestic offshore sector and postponement of several new development
projects.
NC, which builds concrete oil and gas platforms for the offshore sector, saw
eight-month sales fall sharply to NKr2.1bn from NKr3bn and plunged into a
pre-tax loss of NKr5m from a profit of NKr160m.

FT  10 OCT 94 / International Company News: INA management shake-up under
fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's opposition parties have criticised the management shake-up at INA,
the partly privatised insurance giant, accusing the government of dampening
competition in the insurance business.
The former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) claimed Friday's
shake-up had brought in those who were too closely tied to Mediobanca, the
powerful Milan merchant bank and the strongest voice behind the running of
Italy's Generali insurance group.
The PDS also claimed bringing in Mr Cesare Geronzi, the chief executive of
Banca di Roma, reinforced INA's political links with the Christian
Democrats.
The changes were made by the treasury in advance of the second tranche of
the nationalisation of INA, due early next spring. Mr Lorenzo Pallesi, the
chief executive responsible for raising L4,900bn (Dollars 3.15bn) through
the sale in June of the treasury's 51 per cent stake, was eased out.
He is being replaced by a new 13-man board of which the treasury, as
majority shareholder, has appointed 10 members. Minority shareholders can
appoint the other three.
A senior treasury spokesman said the changes had been made after close
consultation with INA's new international shareholders.
He insisted that for the first time professional qualifications and
international experience had been key elements in the choice - two foreign
board members are one from France and Mr Michael Butt, who recently left the
UK's Eagle Star. Two-thirds of the June privatisation stock was acquired by
North American and British investors.
Bankers pointed out over the weekend that it was an unwritten rule that the
management was usually maintained throughout the privatisation process.
Mr Pallesi has so far declined to comment on the new management structure,
which sees his former deputy, Mr Giancarlo Giannini, share the main
responsibilities with Mr Roberto Pontremoli. Former Comit chairman Mr Sergio
Siglienti becomes chairman.

Twelve international telecommunications groups have been selected to enter
the first round of bidding for a stake in SPT Telecom, the Czech Republic's
national telephone monopoly for which the government is seeking a strategic
foreign investor.
The 12 are AT &amp; T, GTE Telephone, Ameritech International, Bell Atlantic
International, Southwestern Bell International Development, Deutsche
Telekom, France Telecom, PTT Telecom Netherlands, Italy's Stet
International, Telecom Denmark, Swiss Telecom and Korea Telecom.
Preliminary bids are expected by next month, from which a short-list will be
drawn up of companies to proceed to a second round. The winner should be
announced by the government by March 1 next year.
Under the present plan, SPT Telecom's share capital is to be increased by 37
per cent. The government will then sell 27 per cent of the enlarged equity
to the strategic partner.
The state's shareholding will then fall from 74 per cent to 51 per cent, a
stake it is to retain for up to five years. The remaining shares,
representing 22 per cent of the capital, are held by institutional and
private investors who have received them through the government's second
wave of mass privatisation.
Estimates of the value of the stake range from Dollars 650m to Dollars 1bn.
J. P. Morgan is acting as financial and strategic adviser to the government
and SPT Telecom in the bidding process.

FT  10 OCT 94 / International Company News: Banco Napoli rating reviewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IBCA, the European credit-rating agency, has put Banco di Napoli's rating
'under observation' pending further examination of the Italian bank's
disappointing half-year figures.
Last week, Banco di Napoli's shares fell 11 per cent after the bank - one of
Italy's largest and oldest financial institutions - announced a heavy
first-half deficit, caused by losses on its investment portfolio and
provisions against bad loans.
But Mr Luigi Coccioli, the bank chairman since May, has hit back at the
negative comments on the bank's results, arguing that investors, and rating
agencies, should be looking at the group's prospects rather than its recent
difficulties.
'We've already seen good signs of recovery, in terms of loans, in terms of
revenue for the bank, which will certainly lead, in my opinion, to a far
better situation by the end of the year,' he said on Friday, after IBCA
announced its decision.
In the next few days, Mr Coccioli is expected to meet Mr Gustavo Minervini,
chairman of the foundation which controls Banco di Napoli, for an informal
discussion of the first-half results, which were published on September 30.
Banco di Napoli lost L168.8bn (Dollars 108.48m) before tax in the first six
months of 1994, compared with a pre-tax profit of L162.2bn in the same
period last year. The bank made provisions of L235bn against bad loans,
mostly to small and medium-sized enterprises in southern Italy, where some
600 of its 800 branches are located.
News of the loss was published after the close of trading on September 30,
but prompted a 14 per cent decline in the bank's share price in the first
four days of last week. By Friday, Mr Coccioli's efforts to reassure
investors appeared to be paying off and the shares recovered by L50 to
L1,496, in spite of a heavily depressed market and the IBCA announcement.
Mr Maurizio Morolli, one of IBCA's Italian analysts, said: 'This loss came
as a surprise. We think it may well be due to cleaning up of a bad loans,
but we are waiting to examine the results.'
Mr Coccioli said Banco di Napoli's experience with bad loans and the
unfavourable environment for securities trading was no different from that
of other Italian banks.
Indeed, the bank has pointed out that its ratio of doubtful loans to overall
loan commitments is lower than the national Italian average.
Italian banks are suffering from the hangover of a deep recession, even as
other Italian companies are showing signs of recovery.
Earlier last month, Banca Popolare di Milano announced poor first-half
results, which it blamed on past over-exposure to heavily indebted Italian
industrial groups, such as Ferruzzi.
Banco di Napoli's IBCA credit rating is A1 for short-term loans and A+ for
long-term loans. That compares with Italy's highest-rated financial
institutions, IMI and Cariplo, which have an AA rating for long-term loans
and a rating of A1+ for short-term loans.

<TEXT>
Warta, Poland's second largest insurer with 14 per cent of the market, is
planning a new stock issue later this month accompanied by a flotation on
the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Warta has 2.6m shares of which 46 per cent are owned by the state. The rest
are owned by private investors including Elektrim, the listed
telecommunications and power equipment trader, with 15 per cent.
Warta employees are being offered between 100,000 and 260,000 new shares
priced at 400,000 zlotys each. The general public is being offered between
700,000 and 1m shares with a minimum price of 800,000 zlotys.
The offer which starts on October 21 should raise a minimum of 6,000bn
zlotys (Dollars 26m) in new funds and could go over the 9,200 zlotys mark if
all the shares on offer are taken up.
Currently Warta's total capital and reserves are worth 4,338bn zlotys while
the company reported a 50.2bn zlotys net profit for the first six months of
this year. Last year's net profit was 169.7bn zlotys.
The flotation will mark the first insurance company listing on the Warsaw
Stock Exchange, which trades 34 stocks capitalised at 87,853bn zlotys.
