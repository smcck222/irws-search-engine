FT  10 OCT 94 / International Company News: Fund to invest in Bulgaria
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   Kerin Hope in Athens
Global Finance, the Greek venture capital company associated with Baring of
the UK, is to launch a Dollars 30m venture capital fund in Bulgaria next
month.
The International Finance Corporation fund, the World Bank's private sector
financing arm, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development are
together contributing 50 per cent of the capital.
The remainder is being provided by Euromerchant Bank, the private Greek bank
controlled by the Latsis shipping group which is sponsoring the fund, and a
group of Greek and international investors.
Euromerchant Balkan Fund will take minority stakes in private companies
based in Bulgaria, including ventures launched by northern European
concerns. It will focus on companies serving the local market in food
processing and retailing and those that export to the former Soviet Union.
It plans to help finance acquisitions of companies under Bulgaria's
privatisation programme, which is expected to speed up as a voucher scheme
gets under way, and Mr Angelos Plakopittas, managing director of Global
Finance, said it would help 'mobilise capital for larger projects that could
be backed by the IFC and the EBRD'.
Bulgaria has attracted only about Dollars 100m in foreign investment since
1990, of which some Dollars 40m has come from Greece.

FT  10 OCT 94 / International Company News: IBM in bid to reclaim PC
leadership with 'Warp'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
With the launch tomorrow of 'OS/2 Warp' a personal computer operating system
program, IBM begins a concerted effort to reclaim technology leadership in
the PC industry.
Warp is a direct challenge to Microsoft Windows, the software that comes
with virtually every PC sold today, except the Apple Macintosh.
At public events throughout North America and Europe, IBM executives will
tout the advantages of Warp. Several leading PC manufacturers, including
Compaq Computer, Dell Computer and Toshiba as well as IBM's own PC division,
are expected to participate in the presentations, promising to offer Warp as
an alternative to Windows.
Warp is, however, just one part of IBM's strategy to reclaim its PC
leadership. Another critical element of the plan is to establish a new
hardware standard for PCs based on the PowerPC microprocessor, jointly
developed by IBM, Motorola and Apple Computer.
IBM is believed to be in intensive negotiations with Apple aimed at agreeing
on a standard design for PowerPC computers that will run both Apple's
Macintosh software and IBM's OS/2 Warp.
Talks between the two companies have been held, on and off, for several
months, but are now a 'high priority'. Rumours that an agreement may be
close and that it could be cemented by an IBM equity investment in Apple
fuelled a sharp rise in IBM's shares on Friday to Dollars 71 1/8 from
Dollars 68 3/4 .
If the companies can agree on a design for a PC that can run both Macintosh
software and OS/2 Warp it could pose a significant challenge to today's PC
standard based on Intel microprocessor chips and Microsoft Windows software.
Talk of an IBM investment in Apple follows a week of intense rumours of
Apple takeover bids by either Motorola, the communications and semiconductor
group, or AT&amp;T, the telecommunications giant.
While the earlier rumours have been dismissed by most industry analysts, the
possibility of IBM taking a stake in Apple rings true because IBM has a keen
interest in persuading Apple to help it to establish a new PC industry
standard.
Of more immediate concern to IBM, however, is the runaway success of its
latest standard PC products. The Aptiva line of IBM PCs for consumers and
small businesses is a sell-out. Just three weeks after introduction, Aptiva
orders have overtaken IBM's planned production for the fourth quarter.

FT  10 OCT 94 / International Company News: Ups and downs of the
rollercoaster - Simon London charts the career of property developer John
Broome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Broome, the property developer who planned to build a leisure
complex on the site of London's Battersea Power Station, has always worked
on a grand scale. His 1,200 acre Carden Park leisure development in
Cheshire, to which receivers were appointed last week, is only the latest in
a string of ambitious projects.
The Carden complex boasts an 18-hole golf course and one of Europe's most
northerly commercial vineyards. Work so far has involved planting nearly
30,000 trees, 10 acres of vines, and restoring 14 miles of dry stone walls.
Aimed squarely at the corporate hospitality market, sports on offer include
croquet, bowls, fly-fishing, game shooting, hot-air ballooning and archery.
More than Pounds 20m has been spent, with planning permission granted for
more. Mr Broome's commitment to Carden is not in doubt: he owns the estate
in person, rather than through a shell company, and last year he sold
Stretton Hall, his country home to raise funds for the development.
Carden, however, needs new equity. The Bank of Scotland, sole lender to the
project, last week appointed Grant Thornton as receivers. The firm will look
for a buyer or some form of refinancing.
In his previous ventures, Mr Broome has tasted both triumph and disaster.
In the early 1980s he turned Alton Towers into one of the country's biggest
tourist attractions. His involvement with the Alton estate dated from his
marriage in 1973 to Jane Bagshaw, whose father owned the former seat of the
Earls of Shrewsbury.
By the time it was sold for Pounds 60m in 1990 to Pearson Group, the media
and leisure company which owns the Financial Times, Alton Towers was the
UK's most popular paid tourist attraction outside London.
Disaster came in the shape of Battersea Power Station, Gilbert Scott's
masterpiece on the banks of the Thames.
When Mr Broome bought the Grade 2 listed building from the Central
Electricity Generating Board in 1987 he was seen as one of the few
entrepreneurs capable of seeing the project through.
The Battersea complex was supposed to accommodate 7,000 visitors an hour at
peak periods, many of them shuttled to the site by a 'Battersea bullet'
train from Victoria station.
Work started in June 1988, with Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister,
performed a renaming ceremony. But problems beset Battersea from the outset.
The foundations, both physical and financial, proved inadequate to take the
strain and Battersea Leisure Group was put into liquidation last year.
Hong Kong property developers George and Victor Hwang bought the company's
debt at a discount and now have effective control of the site. Work on a
re-designed leisure and retail complex is expected to start next year.
But financial reverberations are still being felt. In June, Battersea
Leisure's liquidator issued a writ seeking the return of Pounds 16m
transferred from the company to Alton Towers six years ago.
Former colleagues of Mr Broome describe him as flamboyant but deadly
serious. The Battersea episode clearly rankles after the commercial success
of Alton Towers. Carden Park was another attempt to show that a grand vision
could bring rewards.

FT  10 OCT 94 / UK Company News: T&amp;N poised to sell Goetze elastomers side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T&amp;N, the automotive components and engineering group, is this week expected
to raise more than Pounds 20m from the disposal of part of Goetze, the
German piston ring producer acquired last year for DM250m (Pounds 102m).
The deal is expected to involve Goetze's elastomers business, which
manufactures rubber and metal bonded components.
A senior official at T&amp;N indicated this could be the first of a series of
non-core disposals aimed at reducing the group's Pounds 362.6m net
borrowings, equivalent to gearing of 60 per cent.
Such sales and improved second-half cash flow could cut gearing to about 50
per cent by the year end, the official predicted.
The strategy is designed to give the group additional borrowing resources
should it decide to buy a majority stake in Kolbenschmidt, a leading German
motor components producer.
T&amp;N announced last month that it had agreed to acquire options on a 52.2 per
cent stake in the piston and bearings company.
The acquisition opportunity arose after Metallgesellschaft - the troubled
German metals, mining and engineering group - decided to sell its 47 per
cent holding, while Magna International, the Canadian automotive components
group, is to reduce its stake from 12.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent.
If T&amp;N exercises its options, it would greatly strengthen its position in
the German pistons market, the largest in Europe.

FT  10 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Eurovein float to raise Pounds 14m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurovein, a Sheffield-based specialist engineering concern which has emerged
from WA Tyzack, the old quoted company, is to raise Pounds 14m through a
share issue designed to pay off debts and enable it to expand.
The flotation, announced yesterday , will involve a full Stock Exchange
listing for Eurovein, best known in the UK for its Spencer &amp; Halstead
shotblasting equipment and Tyzack machine knives.
It will mark the return to the stock market of Mr Bill Eastwood, who was
responsible for putting together WA Tyzack between 1987 and 1989. Eurovein's
managing director, Mr Don Stain, was on WA Tyzack's main board.
WA Tyzack went private in 1989 via a heavily-leveraged Pounds 42m management
buy-out, in which neither Mr Eastwood or Mr Stain was involved. They formed
Eurovein the same year, acquiring most of their old company's components
business for Pounds 5m.
Only two years later, however, the buy-out vehicle, GSM, collapsed - a
victim of the recession and its own financial structure. This gave Eurovein
the opportunity to buy GSM's remaining businesses from the receiver for
Pounds 21.2m.
The re-established Eurovein now has three businesses. The largest, surface
treatment, makes shot-blasting equipment, used widely in industry to clean
components before painting. It has operations in the UK, Germany and Italy.
The other two businesses are filtration, based around the French company
Eurofiltec, and components.
Mr Eastwood said Eurovein's sales fell sharply in 1991, prompting a search
for new markets in eastern Europe, east Asia and the Americas, and a
cost-cutting drive. The most important step was the transfer of shotblast
equipment manufacture from Germany to the UK.
The recent trading record is much improved, with operating profit of Pounds
2.6m (Pounds 1.6m) in the year ended July 31, on sales of Pounds 35.7m
(Pounds 29.1m). At the pre-tax level it had a profit of Pounds 635,000 (loss
of Pounds 1.2m).
Mr Eastwood said the businesses generated enough cash to service the group's
debt, but Eurovein's financial structure prevented it from expanding. There
were opportunities for organic growth or acquisition in the three divisions,
and the acquisition of a fourth leg in specialist engineering was not
precluded.
The flotation, which is being handled by Albert E Sharp, the brokers, and
has yet to be priced, will eliminate Eurovein's Pounds 14m term debt.
New shareholders will end up with slightly more than 50 per cent of the
company, as none of the current investors, which include Hambro Group
Investments and 3i, are selling.

FT  10 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Securities vendors link up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three systems of electronic settlement of securities trading link up today,
bringing paperless trading a step closer.
The link allows paperless trading between subscribers to Sequal, the London
Stock Exchange's system which confirms individual share transactions, the
International Securities Markets Association system called Trax, and Thomson
Financial Services' system, Oasys.
The move follows a year of testing the system of electronic trading
confirmation between the three vendors. Many institutions and brokers have
backed the introduction of ETC, but few have subscribed to a system because
until now they would have had to subscribe to all three to confirm trades
with each other.
ETC is a screen-based process which replaces the practice of sending paper
contract notes between brokers and clients. It also shortens the time taken
to confirm equity or fixed-income trades between brokers and institutions.
Ms Christine Dann, director of operations at the London Stock Exchange said:
'The successful conclusion of the inter-vendor links illustrates how we can
work together to provide solutions to the markets' needs.'
Mr Roy Lambert, managing director of ISMA said: 'This link will encourage as
many participants as possible to adopt ETC on all trades.'

FT  10 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Strong overall trend in MBOs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Management buy-out and buy-in activity in the UK was sharply higher in the
third quarter of the year compared with the same period last year, according
to the Centre for Management Buy-Out Res-earch at the University of
Nottingham.
Estimated third quarter activity rose nearly 5 per cent to Pounds 750m after
a 15 per cent rise to Pounds 1.75bn in the first half of the year.
CMBOR's figures did not include the Pounds 366m buy-out of Nutreco, the
animal feeds business bought from BP, which the centre considered an
international deal.
CMBOR, which is sponsored by Barclays Development Capital and Touche Ross
Corporate Finance, said there was a particularly strong jump in management
buy-in activity which accounted for more than a third of the value of deals
in the first half.
Ken Robbie, CMBOR research director, said there had also been a sharp fall
in the number of completed MBOs in London and the south-east of England.
Correspondingly, there was a sharp increase in the number and value of deals
in the Midlands.
The strong overall MBO trend was confirmed by KPMG Peat Marwick. The
accounting firm said there were 16 MBOs with a deal value of more than
Pounds 10m in the third quarter.
KPMG forecasts a strong fourth-quarter for MBO activity leading to a
five-year record level of deals valued at more than Pounds 3.3bn.
Mr Chris Beresford, KPMG's head of MBOs, said there were 'plenty of MBO's
being worked on'. But he called on merchant banks with companies to sell to
give greater consideration to MBO's in preference to trade sales. 'I feel
strongly that sellers should encourage managers, not stifle them,' said Mr
Beresford. 'With their intimate knowledge of the company's potential and the
current weight of funds available for investment, the MBO team . . . can
often be the highest bidder.'

FT  10 OCT 94 / Company News This Week: Better tidings from Main St than
Wall St - JP Morgan/US banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Predicting the quarterly profits of banks which trade heavily in the
financial markets has become a hazardous business. After the upheaval in
bond and stock markets - and a profits warning from Salomon last week - JP
Morgan's third-quarter figures will be approached with caution on Thursday.
During the record 1993, Morgan's income from trading averaged Dollars 514m a
quarter. In the first six months of this year, that average fell to Dollars
292m - roughly the level most analysts expect for the latest period. Largely
as a result, earnings per share at the New York-based bank are generally
expected to fall from Dollars 2.29 a year ago to the Dollars 1.50-Dollars
1.60 range.
For most other big US commercial banks, whose results come in the following
days, the news from the third quarter is likely to be far more predictable:
continuing declines in bad debt provisions, a slight depression in lending
margins as interest rates rise, and accelerating loan growth in some areas
should underpin solid (if unspectacular) earnings gains. Average earnings
per share growth is put at about 10-12 per cent.
Solid earnings per share improvements are expected from BankAmerica (up to
Dollars 1.37 from Dollars 1.18 a year before,) Citicorp (Dollars 1.30,
compared with 97 cents) and NationsBank (up to Dollars 1.55 from Dollars
1.32), among others.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Geld galore in Deutsche Telekom sale: Richard Lapper sees
banks chase a lucrative slice of Germany's giant share issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER, NICK DENTON and ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most international bankers would not willingly submit themselves to an
intensive oral examination by civil servants - especially if the language of
the test is German.
Yet for five days towards the end of last month, senior executives from at
least 19 leading international banks* patiently underwent the ordeal at the
ministry of post and telecommunications in Bonn. All had spent months
preparing written accounts of how they intended to sell the shares of
Deutsche Telekom to international investors when the giant
telecommunications company begins a massive capital-raising exercise - and
'part-privatisation' - in 1996.
The mandate to organise the sale is the most hotly contested on the market.
And the assessment process - conducted by civil servants from the finance
and post ministries, and officials from Deutsche Telekom, has been tough.
Rarely have so many banks been asked to tender for international equity
offers - only four or five were involved in other recent European cases.
Whoever eventually wins the mandate, all those competing agree that the
prize is highly attractive. Bankers will earn fees for raising at least
DM10bn (Pounds 4bn) and possibly up to DM20bn in a deal which will dilute
the government's existing 100 per cent ownership of Deutsche Telekom.
They are expecting the 'fee pool' to amount to at least at least DM360m on
the assumption that the fee structure will be similar to that adopted when
the government sold part of its stake in Lufthansa, the national airline,
last month. In the Lufthansa deal, fees for distribution are understood to
have amounted to 2.1 per cent, with fees related to administration and
underwriting amounting to a further 1 1/2 per cent, for a total of 3.6 per
cent.
Two German banks - Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank - helped the government
in last month's assessment process, and are widely expected to be asked to
place shares with German institutional and retail investors. They may also
be offered part of the international issue.
Analysts expect roughly 40 per cent of the issue to be placed with
international investors, implying that a minimum of some DM150m could be
left for the international placement. A big chunk of that would go to the
international bank which wins the role of global co-ordinator.
Morgan Stanley and SG Warburg are among those mentioned by competitors as
strong contenders. It is Goldman Sachs, however, that has the closest links
with Deutsche Telekom. Goldman advised it in its largest ever acquisition,
that of Hungarian telecommunications company Matav. 'It will be difficult to
prise the mandate away from Goldman,' says a banker at a rival US firm. The
winner would still need to allocate some of the fee for the international
placement to rival banks which would distribute smaller packages of shares
internationally. Typically, banks earn between 2 per cent and 12 per cent of
the lead bank fees for these subsidiary roles, known, for example, as 'lead
co-management', 'co-management' or simply 'management'.
In addition, the losers might also compete for another 'runners up' prize
since a separate bank is likely to be appointed to advise the German
government on its strategy.
Overall the immediate fees available for international bankers are not
considered by bankers to be especially lucrative, compared with some recent
exercises. Bankers are said to have earned more than Dollars 100m (Pounds
63m) in fees from one recent smaller Latin American issue, mainly because
fee rates were higher. And the overall task of marketing the issue,
Germany's second global equity issue, will not be easy. It will partly
depend on the parallel organisation of a retail issue in Germany, in a
country where equity investment is unfamiliar. The sheer size of the issue
could also be a problem in its own right. Large institutions may be
attracted to Deutsche Telekom but they already have a sizeable portfolio of
German stocks, and there are fears that in order to accommodate Deutsche
Telekom they could dump other stocks, depressing prices.
Set against these difficulties are two long-term attractions. Bankers know
that the winner of this first stage will be in pole position to win business
stemming from the future capital-raising exercises that analysts expect to
take place over the next five years and, after the expiry of current legal
restrictions in 2000, a possible fully fledged privatisation.
With Deutsche Telekom currently valued at between DM50bn and DM80bn, the
ultimate size of the prize for bankers could be very considerable indeed.
'If you win the first tranche the chances are you will get a senior role in
the others,' says one UK merchant banker.
'It's a landmark transaction. The perception is that anyone winning their
spurs doing it can expect to be in on the later stages of the deal,' adds a
rival.
And the winning bank would be in a good position to compete for mandates
stemming from other telecommunications privatisations, planned elsewhere in
Europe, Latin America and Asia.
*Among the banks which are understood to have sent submissions: Morgan
Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Salomon Brothers, SG
Warburg, Kleinwort Benson, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, National Westminster, NM
Rothschild, Robert Fleming, Swiss Bank Corporation, CS First Boston, Union
Bank of Switzerland, and several French banks, including Banque Paribas,
Societe Generale and Banque Nationale de Paris.

FT  10 OCT 94 / UK fund managers optimistic about gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK fund managers are much more optimistic about gilts following last month's
base rate increase according to the latest Smith New Court/Gallup survey of
institutional investors.
The balance of fund managers looking to increase gilts holdings has jumped
to 47 per cent from 4 per cent in September.
Smith New Court believes this may reflect the impact of the base rate rise
on inflation, although the survey shows little change in expectations.
The survey shows Japanese equities returning to favour with the balance of
institutions looking to increase their weighting from 21 per cent to 44 per
cent. The October balance is similar to that seen in the first half of the
year. But fund managers are cautious about the prospects for US and
continental European equities. The balance of fund managers looking to
reduce exposure has risen to 26 per cent and 25 per cent respectively.
UK equities have fallen out of favour slightly, with the balance of those
planning to add to holdings slipping from 15 per cent to 7 per cent. Fund
managers are slightly less optimistic about the outlook for the UK economy
and corporate earnings but still bullish about share prices. Earnings per
share are predicted to rise by 15.9 per cent this year but earnings
forecasts for 1995 have been cut by almost one percentage point to 12.5 per
cent.
Among individual sectors, institutions are most positive about
pharmaceuticals, engineering and diversified industrials. Among the least
favoured are construction, general retailers and - following last week's
profits warnings from SG Warburg and Hambros - merchant banks.
The net balance looking to increase their cash holdings has fallen to 7 per
cent, against 29 per cent in September and 42 per cent in July.
Following last month's interest rate rise, fund managers are predicting UK
base rates of 6.8 per cent in a year, compared with a 6.4 per cent forecast
in the previous survey. But their expectations for gilts yields and
inflation are unchanged. They predict inflation of 2.9 per cent at the end
of 1994 rising to 3.7 per cent by the end of next year. Average earnings are
expected to rise by 4.3 per cent during the next 12 months.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Company News This Week: Healthy results could consign row to
history - Body Shop International
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Body Shop International, the UK-based natural cosmetics retailer, will try
on Thursday to put a summer of criticism over its ethical credentials behind
it and focus attention on its trading prospects, as it announces interim
results. Analysts are looking for a healthy increase in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 10m to about Pounds 11.5m for the half year to August 30. Total sales
are forecast to have increased 15 per cent, with UK sales up about 5 per
cent.
Sales in the US, where Body Shop has added 60 new stores, are expected to be
about 30 per cent ahead. The results could boost Body Shop's share price,
which has shown some recovery recently after falling more than 15 per cent
in August amid criticisms of the company's 'green' standards.
Franklin Research, the US ethical investment fund, sparked the debate in
mid-August by advising clients to sell shares in Body Shop. Its decision was
based partly on fears that an article in US magazine Business Ethics might
prove damaging to the company. The article, published two weeks later,
questioned Body Shop's treatment of franchisees, the seriousness of its
commitment to ethical trade and against animal testing, and its product
ingredients.
The criticisms, vigorously countered by Body Shop, do not appear to have
damaged sales, and the company has since been backed by other ethical
investment funds. The affair rumbles on, however. Franklin two weeks ago
published its own report concluding some of the criticisms of Body Shop were
justified and there was a gap between its 'image and reality'.
Most analysts feel Body Shop has weathered the storm and can look forward to
strong growth as its international business expands. House broker NatWest
Markets predicts annual profit growth of between 15 and 20 per cent over the
next five years.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Rivals challenge GE's aero-engine tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rolls-Royce and Pratt &amp; Whitney are challenging proposals by General
Electric of the US to change part of the testing procedure for large civil
aircraft engines to power the new generation of Boeing 777 aircraft.
The dispute, which has come before the US Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA), is likely to have significant implications for the fierce competition
between the big three aero-engine makers to supply heavy-thrust engines to
power Boeing's new 777 and future jumbo jets.
The controversy centres on GE's proposal to use an alternative test
procedure for one of the elements in the airworthiness certification for jet
engines, the 'blade-out' test.
Under the traditional procedure, a blade is released at its root or dovetail
while the engine is running. To pass the test, the blade and other broken
fragments must be confined by the engine's containment ring.
GE proposes to separate the blade not at its dovetail but some distance
above the root area. The US company, which has developed a composite fan
blade for the GE90, argues a composite blade root failure is improbable.
Rolls-Royce and Pratt &amp; Whitney have already completed the tests for their
respective Trent 800 and PW4048 engines under the traditional procedure.
GE's rivals are understood to be pressing for no change in the regulations
since they consider this would give GE an unfair competitive advantage. They
also suggest that the risk of a composite fan blade failure at the dovetail
may be higher than predicted.
GE is the only one of the big three engine makers opting for a composite fan
blade for its heavy thrust engine. Rolls-Royce and Pratt &amp; Whitney are using
wide-chord, hollow titanium blades for their new big engines.
However, should the FAA reject the GE alternative proposal, industry experts
said this could delay GE's certification programme and possibly mean the
company will not be able to deliver its first GE90s to BA on time.
The FAA, which has been analysing the GE proposal for the past few months,
is now expected to reach a decision soon following the submission of
responses it solicited from GE's competitors.

Maxwell pensioners return to the High Court today in two legal challenges

Trustees for the Mirror Group Newspapers pension scheme and the liquidators
of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the former managers of other Maxwell
company pension schemes, are suing Credit Suisse for accepting pension fund
assets as collateral against a loan to the late publisher. The action
brought by the MGN pension trustees is seeking more than Pounds 52m in
damages. BIM is seeking Pounds 28m.
The dispute surrounds a Pounds 50m loan facility from Credit Suisse to Mr
Maxwell's private companies which was agreed in July 1990 and drawn against
in September that year. Both the MGN pension trustees and BIM are arguing
that Credit Suisse was, or should have been, aware that the shares offered
by the publisher as collateral were pension fund assets. The ownership of
the shares was split between the MGN pension scheme and BIM.
Attached to the action brought by the MGN trustees is a further claim
against Credit Suisse by Bank of America for Pounds 25m - the sum paid by
the San Francisco bank to the MGN scheme, without any admission of
liability, in January this year. Bank of America had acted on Mr Maxwell's
behalf as custodian of the disputed shares and passed them on to Credit
Suisse. Credit Suisse has mounted a counter-claim against Bank of America.
Miss Margaret Cole of Stephenson Harwood, the solicitors acting for BIM,
said: 'This is an important step in recovering pension fund assets. It is
the first time a court will rule on a bank's liability for taking pension
fund assets as collateral.'
In February, the MGN trustees settled one case involving pension fund assets
when it accepted a Pounds 32m out of court payment from securities houses
Lehman Brothers, Invesco Asset Management and Capel-Cure Myers.
The actions by the MGN pension trustees and BIM are legally separate, but
will be heard together. They are expected to end early next year.
Credit Suisse is fighting both cases. In a statement, the bank said it was
under no liability to MGN pension trustees or BIM, and that the security
taken for the loan was valid as it had been taken in good faith.

FT  10 OCT 94 / China finance ministry to borrow Dollars 10bn abroad
</HEADLINE>

China's finance ministry expects to increase significantly its foreign
exposure by borrowing about Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.3bn) over the next five
years on international capital markets to help fund the country's
infrastructure requirements, according to a senior ministry official.
Mr Gao Tian, director of the ministry's debt management department, said the
ministry would take advantage of the longer maturities available
internationally to boost its capital-raising abroad. This year the ministry
has issued Dollars 1bn in global bonds.
At the same time, the government would closely monitor borrowing by other
state agencies and corporations to ensure that China's debt service ratio
did not exceed 15 per cent. The present ratio is about 11 per cent.
Mr Gao said China's 'long-term strategy' was to diversify its sources of
capital. It would seek funds in the US, Japanese, Asian and European bond
markets, depending on interest rate trends. He indicated that among the
factors pushing China into the international capital markets was concern
about rapidly increasing obligations to domestic bondholders. Most
government paper carries short-term maturities of between one and five
years.
China this year issued more than Yn100bn (Pounds 7.4bn) of treasury bonds.
Payments to bondholders will rise sharply to an average of Yn70bn over the
next few years from Yn6bn-Yn10bn in the late 1980s. Mr Gao said it was
difficult to persuade domestic investors to purchase bonds with longer
maturities because of concern about rising prices.
He indicated that China expected to maintain a fairly heavy borrowing
programme for the rest of this century, but it would be sensitive to cost.
This reflects a conservative approach within the bureaucracy. China's
foreign debt, including that of state investment agencies, was Dollars
83.5bn at the end of 1993 and is expected to rise to about Dollars 100bn by
the end of this year.
The official Xinhua news agency quoted an official of the state
administration of foreign exchange control as saying recently that 'it was
time for China to limit its foreign borrowing and use as much direct
overseas investment as possible'.
The Xinhua dispatch also reported that the authorities were surveying some
500 enterprises and projects to assess how effectively foreign borrowings
were being used.
Chinese institutions, including among them the China International Trust and
Investment Corporation, the state investment company, have been active in
international capital markets for some time, but the ministry of finance was
relatively slow to tap external sources until last year, with the issuing of
Dollars 300m of 'dragon bonds' in the Asian market, following an earlier
foray into the Eurobond market.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Austrian coalition set to hold power but right gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Austria's long-ruling coalition of conservatives and socialists, led by
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, looked set to return to power after yesterday's
national elections, but with a much reduced 63 per cent of the vote, down
from 75 per cent in 1990.
Voters deserted the Social Democratic party and the conservative Austrian
People's party (OVP) in large numbers for both right and leftwing fringe
parties, raising the prospect of a significant realignment soon.
The biggest winner was the charismatic Jorg Haider, leader of the far right
Freedom party. The FPO raised its share from 16 per cent to nearly 23 per
cent, and could theoretically form a conservative coalition with the OVP.
However, both Mr Haider and Mr Erhard Busek, OVP leader, have ruled this
out, and Mr Vranitzky and Mr Busek said last night they aimed to renew their
pact.
Mr Haider, who came to international attention with a complimentary comment
three years ago about the employment policies of Hitler's Third Reich said
he expected to lead the government after the next election.
Adversaries do not accuse him of being a neo-Nazi, but he appealed openly
during the campaign to voters' xenophobic tendencies, blaming immigrants for
rising crime rates and accusing the government of treating them too
generously.
The coalition's poor result means it will have only 118 of parliament's 183
seats, down from 140. It will no longer have the two-thirds of seats needed
for constitutional changes but can count on the support of the Liberal
Forum, a new left-leaning party which won 5.7 per cent and 10 seats, for the
vote to ratify European Union entry.
The Greens, who raised their seat count from 10 to 13, have been divided on
EU entry. Mr Haider opposed it vigorously, but in vain, in the referendum
campaign four months ago.
The coalition's lost support was blamed mainly on disenchantment with the
cosy partnership between the socialists and conservatives that has governed
since the second world war.
Mr Haider was particularly effective during the campaign at rooting out
examples of excessive patronage given to friends of the ruling parties. Last
night he said the result was a sign 'we have finally succeeded in putting
post-war Austria behind us and ushering in a genuine democracy'.
The OVP's vote has been eroding since the mid-1980s. In this poll its share
dropped from 32.1 per cent to 27.7 per cent for 52 seats, eight fewer.
However, for the first time, the socialists were hurt, their share plunging
from 42.8 per cent to 35 per cent and their seats falling from 80 to 66.

FT  10 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Property
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reality has caught up with UK property, last year's second top-performing
sector in the stock market. This year, the property index has been
struggling ever since the Fed raised US interest rates. Higher bond yields
and UK interest rates have added to its woes. Since the Fed moved in
February, the property index has underperformed the market by 10 per cent.
For a while, property shares were sustained by expectations that economic
growth would generate higher rents. Those hopes have been dashed. Although
there have been pockets of progress for a few premium commercial properties
in the West End of London and the City, income growth has proved elusive.
Many property groups are less dependent than they were on London. But beyond
the capital there have been even fewer signs of an upturn in commercial,
industrial or retail rents. The market's forecasts for rental growth for the
year to March have fallen from 12 per cent to about 7 per cent. There are
fears it could actually reach zero.
Eventually, the effects of 3.8 per cent GDP growth must begin to filter into
the market. The absence of cranes that once dominated the City's skyline
bears witness to the lack of new capacity in the pipeline. But it could be
1996 before rents move significantly upwards throughout the country. A case
for near-term optimism is difficult to make. Some may wish to pick stocks
with good portfolios. But even the more dynamic groups will find it hard to
escape the malaise restraining the sector.

FT  10 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: European cars
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European car market is set to recover from last year's cyclical trough.
But much of this year's growth - expected to be 4 to 5 per cent - is due to
government-sponsored sales incentive schemes in France and Spain. In
Germany, election nerves are limiting the pace of recovery. The rebound in
the UK market reported last week disguised a fall in the number of cars
bought by consumers, the growth coming exclusively from fleet buyers.
All this points to a long, slow recovery. General Motors predicted at the
Paris motor show that European car production would not reach the previous
cyclical peak of 1989-90 until the end of the century. The path back will be
dogged by mounting competition, between the major US and European
manufacturers as well as from Japanese producers. It is thus unlikely that
margins will ever be restored to the levels achieved in the late 1980s.
Shares in European manufacturers such as Volkswagen and Peugeot have risen
strongly over the past 18 months in anticipation of a pronounced recovery in
earnings, but the scope for recovery in Europe is hampered by social and
political impediments to rationalisation. The measures taken by
Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen to cut costs look feeble in comparison with the
root-and-branch restructuring pushed through by the US majors. European car
manufacturers may experience a bounce in earnings from current levels, but
the cyclical upside for investors is likely to be less pronounced than it
has been in the US.

FT  10 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Australia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US is not the only country where markets are looking to see whether the
authorities will push up interest rates. The chances are growing of a
further rise in Australia after the jump to ADollars 2.14bn in the August
balance of payments deficit, the largest monthly figure since early 1990.
Last week Mr Ralph Willis, Australia's Treasurer, sought to down play the
payments figures, citing the drought in Queensland and New South Wales and
rising imports of capital goods as reasons for the disappointment. If that
was why the payments deficit was rising, there would be less need for a
monetary policy response. Evidence that companies are finally stepping up
their investment would be a sign of sustainable recovery. The nagging worry
remains, however, that Australia's current account is once again revealing
the country's structural weakness as a commodity exporter with a relatively
small domestic manufacturing base. Mr Willis points to 16 per cent compound
growth in manufactured exports since the mid-1980s as evidence of change,
but the base was small and the August trade figures showed a slowdown in
non-farm exports.
While such concern persists, Australia will need an eye on the limits to
growth - still officially forecast at 4.25 per cent in the current financial
year. Neither the currency nor the bond markets are likely to tolerate for
long inaction by the Australian authorities once US rates rise again. Sydney
equities have fallen 17 per cent since their peak in February. They may not
yet have fully discounted further interest rate rises in the pipeline.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This year has so far seen two hostile bids fought simultaneously in Britain
and America. The failed Enterprise/Lasmo bid and the current Browning-Ferris
Industries/Attwoods battle have come under the jurisdiction of both the UK's
Takeover Panel and the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The reason is
the large proportion of each target's shares held by US investors - over 20
per cent in Lasmo's case and about three-quarters in Attwoods' case.
Though operating in two jurisdictions adds to the complexity and cost of
takeovers, more bidders are likely to be driven down this route as US
investors increasingly diversify their portfolios overseas. Acquirers may
find it worth pursuing a US stake of as little as 5-10 per cent, given that
they can only compulsorily purchase minority stakes if they win over 90 per
cent acceptances.
Such dual jurisdiction bids subtly change the nature of the takeover game.
Bidders and targets have to appeal to two sets of shareholders, each with
slightly different ways of valuing companies. In the Lasmo bid, much was
made of the fact that US investors look at oil exploration companies on a
cash-flow basis while UK investors are more concerned with assets.
Meanwhile, BFI has argued that Attwoods' earnings should be converted to US
accounting standards in order to decide how much the shares are worth. It
will be no surprise that this turns what first looked like a mean offer into
an apparently generous one. As more bids straddle the Atlantic, dreaming up
similar wheezes should become a growth business for bankers.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Leading Article: The decision is Saddam's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
President Saddam Hussein's decision to move tens of thousands of troops
close to Iraq's border with Kuwait is as illogical as it is personally
consistent.
Iraq's at least partial compliance with UN Security Council Resolutions
passed following the Gulf War in 1991 was beginning to soften some western
attitudes towards the relaxation of sanctions imposed when Iraq invaded
Kuwait. Mr Rolf Ekeus, the UN official in charge of monitoring the
destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, is due to report to the
Security Council today on the extent of Baghdad's compliance. The report was
thought likely to produce evidence which could have been used by countries
such as France and Russia to support Iraq's demands for a softening of
sanctions.
Instead of capitalising on this trend, the Iraqi leader has chosen to
prejudge the Security Council deliberations with a characteristic act of
belligerence, which suggests he has learnt nothing from his repeated gross
errors of judgment over the past decade and a half. Mr Saddam's intention to
provoke a crisis was no bolt from the blue. Mr Hamid Hammadi, Iraq's
minister of information, said last week that it would have to find 'other
ways' of dealing with the Security Council if it insisted on following the
'oppressive' determination of the US to keep sanctions in place.
Regional domination
The US attitude has been similarly well signposted. Mr Robert Pelletreau,
the US assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs, and Mr James
Woolsey, the director of the CIA, have both argued strongly against any
easing of sanctions. They claim that Iraq still harbours ambitions of
regional domination. Mr Pelletreau added: 'Iraq today is not in full
compliance with any of the UN Security Council resolutions. It has not even
met the basic requirement . . . of formally recognising the UN-demarcated
border with Kuwait.' Mr Woolsey additionally asserted that the Iraqi regime
was still hiding Scud missiles, chemical weapons and its entire biological
weapons programme.
Whatever the relative merits of the arguments over the degree of Iraqi
compliance with UN resolutions, there can be little dispute that the
instincts of the Iraqi leader have not been moderated by his experience
during and after the Gulf war. Everything Saddam Hussein does is based on
retaining power in Baghdad, and for the past 14 years he has sought to
explain away the suffering of his population by first the war with Iran and
then by the hostility of the US. Mr Saddam's current military posturing may
be as hollow as his threat in 1990 to unleash the 'mother of all battles'
against the western allies, but it serves to embellish his role of the
embattled Arab leader struggling against an international conspiracy.
Humanitarian suffering
It also seeks to disguise the fact that the Iraqi regime is solely
responsible for the appalling state of the nation. Iraq could tomorrow
renounce any territorial claim to Kuwait and, however reluctantly, accept
the UN-designated border. It could make quite clear its intention never to
use force against its neighbours. Mr Saddam could avail himself of UN
security resolution 706 which allows Iraq to sell some oil to relieve
humanitarian suffering within Iraq.
He has chosen to do none of these things, but instead expects the UN to ease
sanctions on the basis of his partial technical compliance with the
demolition and future monitoring of weapons of mass destruction. It is
difficult to believe that Mr Saddam, for all his ignorance of western
political systems, could not have foreseen the reaction to his renewed
military threats. It is almost as if he wished sanctions to be retained.
In these circumstances he leaves the UN Security Council and the western
allies very little choice. Critics may well continue to complain that the US
has no coherent longer-term policy for dealing with Iraq, other than
maintaining sanctions which have so far failed to bring about a change of
political attitude, or a change of regime in Baghdad. The west might well
consider doing more to soften the secondary effects of sanctions on
countries such as Turkey and Jordan. But in the final analysis the easing of
the Iraqi tragedy rests with the regime in Baghdad, and perhaps with those
who have the opportunity and courage to bring about its demise.

Chief financial officers of US companies know a good thing when they see it.
For a few days last week they were able to save millions of dollars on their
securities registration fees, thanks to a congressional delay in approving
the Securities and Exchange Commission's new budget.
The delay meant the SEC was temporarily unable to charge companies its usual
fees for registering securities.
Instead of the normal 0.035 per cent, the agency was forced - by the rules
of a temporary funding bill passed earlier this year - to charge only 0.02
per cent. Chicken-feed.
Mind you, these are big broilers. Chrysler rushed to register Dollars 18.6bn
of securities, saving itself a handsome Dollars 2.7m in fees. General Motors
saved Dollars 1.4m on Dollars 7.1bn of securities.
Blame two Republican senators for holding up the new budget. They wanted to
attach to the funding bill a measure giving married couples a bigger tax
break, worth an extra Dollars 1,750, on their savings.
Meanwhile, who will count the millions of corporate dollars saved at the
expense of US taxpayers?

In the next scene, as the couple emerge from the cinema, the woman raises

In the German version she says: 'And where will we go for a drink

Conservative central office's efforts to reduce its estimated Pounds 15m
overdraft will not be helped by gaffes such as the one visited on Sir
Alistair Grant, the genial Scottish millionaire who is chairman of the
Argyll supermarket group.
Sir Alistair, whose company has over the past decade contributed some Pounds
250,000 to Tory coffers, was irritated earlier this year to receive a
gushing letter from party HQ asking him to consider making a 'first time'
donation.
As an indication of the party's organisational prowess, Sir Alistair
considered this less than impressive. He promptly cut the company's annual
donation from Pounds 30,000 to zero.
Who carries the can for the embarrassing error? Central office is
understandably reticent but it is reliably understood the letter was
authorised by David Sieff, the Marks and Spencer director, and until
recently among the high-powered businessmen helping to run the Tories'
finances.
For entirely unconnected reasons, Sieff is now devoting his spare time to
being chairman of the board distributing cash from the UK's new national
lottery.

They keep the prestige motor for doing business in Germany - where they feel

Presumably they keep the moped for dealing in the UK - so they won't offend

FT  10 OCT 94 / Observer: Harmonious union
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Choosing Belgian socialist Willy Claes to be Nato's secretary general makes
it easier to fill the same post at Europe's other defence organisation, the
Western European Union. But not much.
Leading the WEU is a sensitive job. Whoever gets it will have to jolt into
full-blooded existence a body which - having finally got Washington's
blessing - has been designated as the European Union's defence arm.
Claes's victory probably eliminates his compatriot, Marc Eyskens, from the
WEU race; the rules of European musical chairs dictate a limit on Belgians -
or any other nationality - occupying top notches.
Portugal's Jose Cutilheiro is in with a chance, with his Atlanticist
credentials appealing to the UK, though not to the French. The two
front-runners though are veteran Italian diplomat Giovanni Jannuzzi,
currently ambassador to Nato, and Enrique Baron Crespo, the Spanish
politician and former president of the European Parliament.
The Spaniard's socialist background might count against him, too many
socialists being almost as difficult to swallow as too many Belgians.
The Italian camp stresses the quiet efficiency with which Jannuzzi
co-ordinated the EU's foreign policy secretariat for four years. France
anticipates a stalemate and a couple of its former cabinet ministers wait in
the wings.
With so little union, maybe the incumbent, former Dutch defence minister
Willem van Eekelen, would like to stay put?

FT  10 OCT 94 / Foreign speculators raise the stakes: Enthusiasm for
Russia's stock markets is growing, but the risks remain great
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In recent weeks Moscow's more opulent hotels have been crammed with foreign
investment bankers, venture capitalists and fund managers, chattering
excitedly about a possible turn in Russia's economic fortunes.
'This is one of the greatest investment opportunities of the 20th century,'
enthuses one fund manager. 'Russia is the single most important emerging
market for us at the moment,' says another, Mr Mark Donegan, an equity
strategist at Morgan Grenfell, the UK-based merchant bank.
This interest has triggered a wave of speculative buying. In the past six
months foreign investors have been flocking into Russia's infant stock
markets, causing the prices of some shares to jump by as much as 30 per cent
a day. Some shares have risen 10 times in dollar terms over the past year,
or about 25-fold in rouble terms.
According to Mr Anatoly Chubais, privatisation minister, the rate of foreign
portfolio investment has accelerated to Dollars 500m a month, compared with
about Dollars 1bn for the whole of 1993. CS First Boston, the international
investment bank, estimates total foreign portfolio investment this year may
exceed Dollars 3bn.
But the excitement still needs some explaining. Headline statistics suggest
Russia's economy is still mired in recession, with industrial production
having fallen 28 per cent in the past year. The government is under severe
budgetary pressure. The rouble is falling fast. Thousands of companies are
experiencing an acute cash-flow crisis and many have not been able to pay
their workers for months - one industrial company, for example, recently
resorted to settling its wage bill in job-lots of tampons which it had
somehow bartered.
Yet the picture is far from uniform. While some parts of the Russian economy
are contracting, others - particularly in the services sector - are growing
at a frenetic pace. The mass privatisation of 120,000 state-owned
enterprises is also proving a brutally effective learning process for
Russia's old-school management in how to run their companies profitably.
The speed of the privatisation has meant many of the most attractive assets
have been hastily bundled into corporate parcels. That has created some
powerful and potentially wealthy industrial companies, which could yet
dominate the Russian economy in the way giant corporations helped shape US
development in the 19th century.
It is these few corporate colossi, mainly clustered in the oil, gas, mining,
metals, electricity and telecommunications sectors, which most appeal to
western investors - especially following increases in global commodity
prices.
These companies are fast learning how to speak the language of western
investors to attract much-needed capital. Lukoil, one of the most
progressive of the new oil companies, has already made slick investment
presentations in New York. Five other Russian companies, which may issue
global depositary receipts - or certificates representing shares  - next
year, staged a well-received investment road show in London last month.
The investors' prayer is that these companies could eventually produce
phenomenal returns from their rich assets. One investment bank calculates
that if Gazprom, which controls more than 30 per cent of the world's known
gas reserves, could generate the same financial return on assets as its
western peers, and attract an equivalent stock market rating, it would
emerge as the most valuable company in the world.
Despite spectacular share price rises recently, such assets still appear
cheap by global standards. The Moscow Times index of the 30 most actively
traded Russian stocks estimates their total market value at about Rbs74bn
(Dollars 26bn). Put another way, the bulk of Russia's vast natural resources
and corporate assets is currently given about the same value as Glaxo, the
UK pharmaceuticals company.
While this theory may be enticing, much remains uncertain - and there is
plenty to alarm the investor. 'In many respects, Russia is a pre-emerging
market and lacks many of the most basic playing rules. We will see a number
of problems and scandals in the market. That is only to be expected,' says
Mr Martin Andersson, chief executive of Brunswick, a Swedish-owned,
Moscow-based stockbroker.
Russian accounting remains opaque and the concept of corporate governance
hazy, making it impossible to value Russian companies on conventional
measures of earnings, cash flow or dividend yield. Instead, appraisals have
to be made on factors such as proven reserves, share of global metals
production, price per unit of energy produced - or even density of telephone
lines.
There is inevitably a large dash of wishful thinking thrown in. If there
were ever a reconciliation of accumulated inter-enterprise debts, many
Russian companies would surely be bust. Far from being cheap, many current
share prices could yet look absurdly generous.
The other chief worry is the sheer difficulty of trading shares, a reminder
of the old saw that an emerging market is one from which you cannot emerge
in an emergency. A dozen relatively orderly local stock exchanges have been
set up, but 95 per cent of shares are still traded over the counter through
a myriad of small brokers - many of whom dabble in commodities from shares
to human hair.
One frustrated western fund manager says: 'The biggest task is simply trying
to get buyers and sellers to meet. It is still very difficult to know what
the price of a share is.' Prices quoted to investors often prove meaningless
and the spreads between bid and offer prices can be as wide as 40 per cent.
Even when shares are bought, it is extremely onerous to register ownership.
Legislation requires new owners to enter their names on a shareholder list
kept in the company's home town. Travel-weary stockbrokers spend much time
scurrying off to obscure Siberian towns simply to register their purchases.
Local stockbroker associations have been formed to address these concerns
and introduce self-regulation. Western government-funded projects are also
helping develop effective clearing and settlement systems. Banks, such as CS
First Boston and Chase Manhattan, are establishing custodial services to
give investors greater confidence about the security of their investments.
But mainstream investors will remain deterred until such doubts are
resolved.
The Russian government is drawing up further securities legislation, which
promises effective regulation. It is also devising means of channelling the
domestic savings pool into the productive economy, rather than into
speculative investment schemes, which could give the markets a further
boost.
The successful development of secondary markets would solve many government
dilemmas. A strong domestic shareholder culture would help entrench the
economic reform process and produce greater industry accountability. Capital
markets would also provide an alternative means of development finance,
helping wean industry off state credits.
But the success of the reform-minded ministers is far from assured. It is
only a year since tanks were shelling the Russian parliament building, and
the political situation remains precarious. Russian nationalists are already
campaigning about what they see as a sell-out to foreigners, and there
remains a danger of expropriation. The economy, too, could unravel in the
face of social unrest, demands for industrial subsidies and a further spurt
of hyper-inflation.
As yet, only the hedge funds and private individuals have been bold enough
not only to identify the risks but to swallow them. Their interest is
clearly to talk up the market and take their gains by selling out to
incoming fund managers. That may already be happening as Russian share
prices have softened in the last few days. But there is a chance that the
astonishing speed of change in Russia's capital markets could presage the
start of much longer-term growth in investment, as mainstream fund managers
and Russian domestic investors grow confident enough to commit serious
funds.
'I would like to think that this is not a passing emerging-market fad,' says
Mr Andersson of Brunswick. 'The sheer size of Russia's resources and
companies must one day ensure that it assumes an appropriate place in the
world's equity markets.'

FT  10 OCT 94 / Personal View: Sleepless and irritable in suburbia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM CULLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the height of Washington's long hot summer, my house was without power
for 48 hours as storms swept through the area. It brought home to my family
the extent to which we rely on electricity for air conditioning, television,
to keep food fresh - even to make a hot drink.
After two sleepless nights and irritable days, we felt we had been through a
major disaster. But we had simply experienced a few inconveniences. We knew
we could escape to the car's air conditioning, we could buy fresh food at
the supermarket, we could go to the cinema if we became bored with family
conversation.
As an employee of the World Bank, which is committed to improving the
quality of life of the world's poorest people, I could not help comparing
our 'devastating' inconvenience with the reality of daily life for the 2bn
people in developing countries who have no electricity.
The same number of people lack adequate sanitation - at least our bathrooms
continued to function during our blackout. We did not much enjoy our
lukewarm water and beer, but 1bn people do not have access to safe water. It
is little surprise, therefore, that every year more than 3m children in
developing countries die of diarrheal disease, not to mention all the other
illnesses that result from their living conditions.
The 17 per cent of World Bank lending that supports investments in
population, health, nutrition and education helps people in ways that are
easily recognised. These investments tend to be mutually supportive:
educated women, for example, have smaller families and healthier and
better-educated children.
Such projects often have obvious appeal to the public. An example is the
World Bank-financed project which will enable 8m blind people in India -
one-fifth of the world's blind - to see again as a result of cataract
surgery.
Less appealing is that portion of World Bank lending that pays for the
provision of electricity, clean water and sewerage. In the last decade the
bank has committed Dollars 25bn to electric power projects and more than
Dollars 8bn to water and sanitation.
The fact is that, in the past 30 years, life expectancy in developing
countries has been extended by some 15 years, the number of children dying
before the age of five has been halved, and literacy has increased
dramatically. Most of the credit must go to the people of the countries
themselves, but the investments the World Bank has supported have made a
valuable contribution to improving living standards and reducing the
incidence of disease.
Why then does the World Bank come in for so much criticism - especially over
its lending for dams that create electricity and for other large projects?
Small can often be beautiful but, for all the advances of the last few
decades, the number of people who lack the basics in life is massive.
Many can be helped by small-scale, grass-roots efforts, but these must be
complemented by the big investments that will bring electricity, water and
sanitation to very large numbers of people. Similarly, irrigation projects
have contributed to a doubling of food production and an increase in average
nutritional intake per person of 20 per cent over the past quarter century.
Unfortunately, such larger efforts have the potential to cause environmental
damage, and people may have to be resettled. The challenge for the bank and
its partners in development is to work with the countries it is trying to
help, to keep negative effects to a minimum.
The bank has not always been as successful as it would wish - and its own
self-critical reports, designed to improve future performance, provide ample
fodder for critics.
But a vocal minority does not want the bank to do a better job. This group
would like the bank to steer clear of any activities that challenge the
right of people to live in pristine poverty if there are any negative side
effects. Unfortunately, the bank does not have the luxury of turning its
back on that which may be controversial or difficult.
In 1651, Thomas Hobbes, the English clergyman and philosopher, characterised
the life of people living in a simple world of nature - without industry,
without trade, and without the benefits of modern inventions - as 'poor,
nasty, brutish, and short'. The inconvenience of a few hours without
electricity in suburban Washington is a modest reminder of what life is like
for the millions without electricity, clean water or sanitation in
Bangladesh, Bolivia or Burkina Faso.
They must not be condemned to the state described by Hobbes.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Trouble ahead for the CAP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is one of the European Union's quainter superstitions that the Common
Agricultural Policy has quasi-magical staying power. Squeezed by budgetary
stringency, bombarded in transatlantic trade wars, riven with internal
contradictions of all kinds, the policy cruises on regardless. Its powerful
defenders - in the European Commission's agricultural directorate and in
Europe's farm lobbies - speak as if its existence, and its virtues, were
synonymous with those of the Union itself.
If the warnings emanating from some authoritative quarters in recent weeks
are any guide, however, such confidence in Europe's farm policy is in for a
shaking.
On the one hand, the Union is still struggling to absorb the reforms
introduced in the early 1990s by farm commissioner Ray MacSharry. On the
other, it faces new pressures resulting from its commitment to take in
members from central Europe. An independent report published by the
Commission late last month recommended wholesale CAP reform to prepare the
EU for further enlargement. Last week, the UK National Farmers Union warned
that without fundamental change in the CAP, enlargement could stretch it to
breaking point and even cause the demise of the EU.
Biting reforms
Warnings of this kind may sound odd only two years into a major CAP reform.
But in truth the MacSharry changes - under which farmers are paid to 'set
aside' a given proportion of their arable land from production, and EU
prices are reduced - have only bought time for the EU and curbed the
excesses that threatened a trade war with the US. The reforms are biting, to
the perverse extent that grain shortages have recently forced internal EU
prices up; the Commission was moved last week to propose a minor relaxation
of the set-aside regime. But the MacSharry changes are no answer to the
problems which will be posed by enlargement.
Unless it carefully prepares for this challenge now, the EU could face a
serious crisis over agriculture in 1996, when the MacSharry reforms run out,
as the desire for further enlargement collides with an inability to manage
or finance it. Such a crisis would complicate the fraught constitutional
debate due to take place in the inter-governmental conference set for that
year. At worst it could derail what is arguably the EU's most important
strategic task: stabilising the countries to its east, and spreading its own
prosperity.
Price supports
The problem lies in the CAP's price support measures, under which EU farmers
are paid more than world market levels for their produce. Extending such
price supports to farmers in, say, Poland would almost certainly cause a
production explosion, growth of unsaleable surpluses and consequent trade
conflicts, and the collapse of the EU budget. On the other hand, excluding
Poland and the other Visegrad countries from as central an EU policy as the
CAP - either altogether or for a protracted transition period - is unlikely
to be politically feasible.
Hence the urgent need to consider more radical CAP reform. One option,
suggested in a paper produced for the Commission by independent experts in
June, would be to lower EU support prices to a level that covers only core
production costs, establish a standard level of support prices in the
eastern European countries and bridge the gap between the two by means of
export refunds and import duties. Another would be to scrap or phase out all
EU price support and replace it with some other form of social aid,
decoupled from production.
These are not arcane or remote questions. Such adjustment will be necessary
even without full EU membership on the part of the central European
countries. For if the Union's promises to dismantle trade barriers with
these states are to mean anything, it will have to let in more of their farm
produce, creating greater competition for the farmers of western Europe.
That in turn is why some EU governments are seriously mistaken if they think
these issues will go away. Germany, for one, will be forced to address them
as a result of its own strong commitment to bringing its central European
neighbours into the Union. If the price of doing so is CAP reform, it will
have to be paid.

FT  10 OCT 94 / A morning outing in Mitteleuropa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Having a couple of days to spare between meetings in Frankfurt and Vienna, I
decided to spend the intervening weekend in Prague, and to visit a colleague
in Bratislava on an outing from Vienna.
Prague is now a boom town, relatively inexpensive by comparison with other
European cities. It is awash not only with US tourists, but with young
Americans living there. Indeed it reminded me of what I had read of Paris in
the 1920s, where American writers were attracted both by the cultural
atmosphere and the favourable exchange rate.
By contrast the Slovak republic seems to sell itself short. Gone is the
hourly tramcar which rolled between Vienna and Bratislava before the second
world war. If you do not want to take a train before breakfast, the only way
to make a lunchtime appointment in the Slovak capital is by the 9am
hydrofoil, which I needed no urging to take.
I went on one of those brilliant autumn days when the Danube seemed, if not
blue, at least bright grey. Nearly all the journey is through a dull flat
Austrian stretch. Then suddenly a ridge, known optimistically as the Little
Carpathians, appears. A fort perched on a hill emerges on the left, followed
by a modern bridge, behind which one sees some communist-type structures and
an 18th century baroque city in the background. You are in Malcolm
Bradbury's Slaka.
The military types at the customs station would have made the 'good soldier
Schweik' seem smart by comparison. All this was great fun for the tourist
from the last still-working socialist economy (Austria). But Bratislava
itself was spruce and clean and the people uninhibited and friendly.
Yet it is difficult to find information on Bratislava in Vienna, though it
is less than 40 miles down the river. And even in a top Bratislava hotel I
could only find a very brief business guide which said nothing about the
many picturesque baroque buildings which make the old town into a
well-preserved Hapsburg city, which would be a main tourist attraction if it
were in Austria, the Czech lands or Hungary.
What I found more surprising was that I could not buy a copy of the
Financial Times or even order a cup of coffee with Czech korunas at the (now
French-owned) hotel, even though they are the more valuable variety. Nor
were Austrian schillings or D-Marks acceptable. So I had to go to the
cashier to buy some Slovak korunas, which I had to purchase with schillings.
He explained that under an agreement between the two countries only Czechs
could change Czech into Slovak korunas.
I wondered whether the hotel behaviour showed that some people were prepared
to pay a price in lost receipts to satisfy national pride. So I naturally
offered Czech korunas to a waiter, a barman and taxi driver, all of whom
readily accepted them. My train back to Vienna was due before I could
continue the experiment.
Travellers are officially not allowed to bring either Czech or Slovak
korunas into or out of either country. Nor is there much point in trying to
do so, as the official rates are pretty near those prevailing in the
inactive grey markets.
In fact the frontier police did not ask me any questions about currency
either on my way to or from the Czech Republic. But when I took the train
back from Bratislava to Vienna, I was asked by a courteous young man in
smart military uniform (no Schweik he) whether I had any Slovak korunas. I
showed him my wallet containing 240 (worth about Pounds 5). He told me (in
German) that 100 korunas was the limit. When I held out the remainder to him
interrogatively, he smiled and told me to keep it all. He even politely
shrugged off a tip of 40 korunas.
The Czech koruna has obviously been stronger than the Slovak variety. Since
May 1993, it has been fixed against a basket with a 65 per cent share for
the D-Mark and 35 per cent for the US dollar. But the result has been
scarcely distinguishable from shadowing the D-Mark - the most grievous sin
in the book, according to Lady Thatcher, who otherwise so admires Vaclav
Klaus, the prime minister.
Since the 10 per cent devaluation of mid-1993, the Slovak koruna has also
been stable and growth has resumed. If Vladimir Meciar, the nationalist
election victor, is wise, he will not undermine the progress made.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not very synchronised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID R RICHARDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to congratulate Ian Davidson on his perceptive article,
'Vichy casts a shadow' (September 28), which traces France's inability to
accept shared responsibility for its recent past, as mirrored in a recently
published biography of Francois Mitterrand.
As a Reuters correspondent in Paris from 1952-57, I witnessed similar
psychological inability to accept events which were painful to the French
psyche. For example, the fall of Dien Bien Phu in Indochina, and the
surrender of the French army, were explained away by my French friends as
the fault of the German members of the French Foreign Legion who were
fighting there at the time.
The French people are intensely individualistic, a quality which manifested
itself in the political arena in the many different parties of the Fourth
Republic in the 1950s, and which reveals itself today in the constant
dissensions between party ranks. I suggest this passionate individualism
makes it difficult for them to accept a shared responsibility for the past.
Sanche de Gramont, in his book The French, Portrait of a People says:
'France is not a synchronised country. It is like an ungaited horse, each of
whose legs is proceeding at a different cadence.'
I quote this with affection for the days I spent in the country, and the
friends I made there.

<TEXT>
Sir, I recently asked at my local post office for a postal order for Pounds
13, to send to my nephew whose 13th birthday approaches. I was given two
postal orders, one for Pounds 10, for which the charge was 66p, and one for
Pounds 3, for which the charge was 44p. This represents percentage charges
of 6 per cent and 14.7 per cent. The total price of Pounds 14.10 represented
a charge of 8.5 per cent.
It seems to me that this puts the contentious topic of bank charges into a
new perspective. It is also a further demonstration of the fact that the
poorer you are, the more you have to pay. I shall not be purchasing any more
postal orders.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Double strike well in sight: Is the UK about to achieve
steady growth without a balance of payments crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nobody in the City is shouting it yet. But this year's narrowing in the UK
trade deficit has raised hopes that Britain is on the threshold of a rare
feat in its recent economic history - steady growth without a deepening
trade deficit and balance of payments crisis.
Exports are growing fast, according to the Central Statistical Office.
Figures published last week showed a rise in export volumes of 10 per cent
in the three months to July compared with a year ago. Oil and gas accounted
for about a tenth of this rise, but most manufacturing sectors enjoyed
expansion.
At the same time, imports have remained relatively flat, in contrast to the
1980s. Then, imports were sucked in to meet rising domestic demand,
contributing to a rapid deterioration in the trade deficit.
Between May and July this year, however, import volumes fell by 2 per cent
compared with the previous three months, and were only 4 per cent higher
than in the same period last year.
Rising exports and flat imports have reduced the trade deficit to Pounds
2.5bn, a level seen only briefly since the mid-1980s. As a result of this -
and investment flows into the UK - the current account deficit on the UK's
balance of payments fell to Pounds 0.7bn in the second quarter, its lowest
level for seven years.
The figures have cheered economists in the City of London. Though many last
year predicted a current account deficit of Pounds 15bn in 1994, most now
expect it to be nearer Pounds 5bn, below the government's Budget forecast of
Pounds 9.5bn. A few, including Midland Global Markets, even predict a
surplus next year.
The question now dividing economists is whether the turnabout represents a
broad change in the UK's economic base, or a temporary phenomenon based on
rising world demand.
Mr Geoffrey Dicks, chief UK economist at National Westminster Bank, is one
of the optimists. He says the 1992 devaluation of sterling has been the
catalyst for a broader shake-up among manufacturers, leaving industry more
competitive. 'We are winning export markets and winning back our home
markets too,' he says.
Mr John Mayo, finance director of Zeneca, the bioscience group, believes
that the devaluation 'obviously helped' the company's exports, which grew by
almost 20 per cent last year. 'Our view is not that sterling is now
super-competitive, but that it was overvalued before,' he says.
Vosper Thorneycroft, the shipbuilder, is another company with rising exports
 -up 35 per cent last year, primarily to the Middle East. Mr Martin Jay,
managing director, says devaluation has helped against German competitors,
but improvements in efficiency have also been important. 'In the last five
years our productivity for steel ships has risen by 50 per cent,' he says.
Businesses such as his say that rising productivity, competitive labour
costs and a greater awareness of markets such as the Far East are
contributing to export growth.
'The improvement in the export volume has been going on for some time,' says
Mr Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research. 'The long decline in the UK's market share of world trade which
goes back to the war was halted and even reversed in the mid-1980s.'
There is also evidence that UK companies are winning back customers in the
domestic market. Mr Ian Thompson, economist at the Engineering Employers'
Federation, says that recent trade figures suggest that, 'at first sight',
some companies are now resorting to import substitution.
Engineering company Powerscreen, for instance, will next month extend its
factory in Wales to produce goods previously sourced from Asia and South
Africa. 'When sterling devalued, we had two choices - to push up prices or
use import substitution. We've raised prices a bit, but now we are trying to
make the things ourselves,' says Mr Shay McKeown, chief executive.
The car industry is also seeking to source more components from the UK, says
the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. And retailers such as
Safeway have increased their share of goods from the UK.
Many in the City, however, remain unconvinced that the improvement in the UK
trade figures reflects fundamental change in British manufacturing
competitiveness.
The growth in exports, for example, has accompanied the pick-up in world
demand, particularly in the US. Other exporting countries are experiencing
similar upturns: exports from Spain and Italy, which also devalued their
currencies in 1992, grew by 15.4 per cent and 9.8 per cent respectively last
year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development.
As for the fall in imports, there is only limited evidence of UK
manufacturers switching to domestic suppliers.
Companies such as Casket, the UK's second largest bicycle manufacturer, find
that buying their components in the UK is not a viable option. 'South-east
Asia produces them so cheaply it would be difficult for a UK manufacturer to
compete,' says Mr Joe Smith, Casket's chief executive.
Nor are many companies reporting sharp increases in domestic market share
over foreign competitors. British Steel, which has seen export demand rise
to the point where it has now closed its export order books for steel
construction units for the year, reports little change in its home market
share.
Some economists suspect that the new system for recording European Union
trade is understating imports. But more significant may be the nature of the
UK recovery.
Consumer demand led the recovery last year, but has since slowed, partly as
a result of this year's tax rises. Imports of consumer goods - which
represent about 15 per cent of total imports - have fallen sharply as a
result.
Meanwhile, corporate investment has barely picked up, leaving imports of
investment goods and components - which account for about 30 per cent of
total imports - flat.
A time-lag between recession and investment growth is not unusual, but the
delay seems to have been longer this time. If investment rises sharply next
year as capacity constraints start to bite and business confidence rises,
this could push imports up again.
Some economists, such as Mr Bill Martin, chief economist at Union Bank of
Switzerland, warn that further economic growth will herald a return to
problems with Britain's trade balance. Mr Martin argues that the UK's
manufacturing base is too narrow to meet demand. Others say that exports may
slow as growth falters in markets such as the US.
However, the City Cassandras appear to be a minority. 'It is difficult to be
concerned about rising imports if they are being used to invest to expand
capacity to export,' says Mr Ian Shepherdson of Midland Global Markets.
And with growth in industrial output forecast to exceed consumer spending
growth next year, exports are likely to become increasingly important in the
recovery. Annualised growth in manufacturing output was running at more than
4 per cent in August, says the CSO, while the annualised growth in consumer
expenditure in the second quarter, the most recent figure, was about 3 per
cent.
Meanwhile, imports of consumer goods may grow little if - as many banks
predict - private consumption increases by less than 2 per cent next year.
A balance of payments surplus may still be a distant prospect. But the
possibility of an export-driven recovery is enough to make most economists
smile. They are certainly taking the scenario seriously.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Plans for agency owe more to dogma
than concern for business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HOWARD PELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report, 'Companies House plans attacked' (October 4), describes
but one of the threats arising from the proposal by trade and industry
secretary, Michael Heseltine, to contract out most of the agency's services.
Within three to five years of a contractor being appointed, the agency's
London presence would be reduced to being that of a deposit-only (ie post
box) facility. More than 100 jobs would be lost in the process.
By then, Companies House would merely be a wholesaler of company
information, with large commercial retailers offering on those data (no
doubt supplemented with other business information which many users might
not actually want) at 'commercial' rates. At this point, many company search
agents' jobs, and perhaps entire businesses, would be lost.
Meanwhile, the contractor or contractors who had taken over what remained of
Companies House would be trying, understandably, to make a profit. However,
the European Court ruling in the so-called Italian Tax case ('Companies
House to cut charges after EU court ruling', August 16) would prevent that
margin from being derived from Companies House fee income. Since ministers
have claimed that contracting-out would not increase costs to the taxpayer,
the only way left to ensure contractors' profitability would be by allowing
them to reduce the quality of the service offered.
This then raises a far bigger issue than the consequential loss of several
hundred jobs to the struggling south Wales economy.
Company information is simply not going to be as available, accurate and
complete as it is now. Good news no doubt for companies with something to
hide: bad news for others about to do business with them.
A large and growing number of our customers are now the ones who are saying
loudest that Conservative dogma and ideology, and not true concern for
business, are what really lie behind the Companies House review. It is about
time that ministers started to listen.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RUDOLF BEGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Brussels' foot on the brake' (October 6) tacitly
assumes that anything that looks good for producers has to be bad for
consumers.
Such an assumption would mean that manufacturers do not care about their
customers, that they are not interested in competing with each other
precisely in the area of customer service quality and that they need to be
told by national and EU authorities how to be commercially successful. This
assumption betrays a surprising ignorance of the competitive factors driving
the automobile trade and a serious lack of commercial common sense.
Despite all the imperfections of the yet to be completed Single Market,
there is no sector that has become as truly pan-European and competitive as
the motor vehicle industry, as any manufacturer which wishes to survive well
knows.
The 'perversity' referred to in your editorial is truly that of all too
prevalent economic parochialism and an unnatural clinging to ideological
catchwords, repeated ad nauseam.
The single-minded objective of every car manufacturer has to be the highest
possible level of every aspect of customer service. The present system of
distribution is the best guarantee that competitive pressures will be
sharpened. It is the customer who would pay for any upheaval in the system,
through less service, quality, choice and competition, likely to result in
higher prices. When will Europe's economic ayatollahs awaken to this fact?

FT  10 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: More to cut in CAP cost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TERRY WYNN, MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It really is good news that the European Commission is willing to
stimulate debate on further change to the Common Agricultural Policy just
two years after the MacSharry reforms were adopted (your articles 'CAP
report sends tremors through Brussels', September 30 and 'Trouble down on
the farm', October 3). For 'reform-minded' politicians the publication of
this latest study signals a shift towards a more flexible approach from the
Commission on agricultural policy.
It also shows that the Mac-Sharry reforms were an important step but that
less costly ways of compensating farmers for price reductions must be found.
In 1995, the EU will still be paying Ecu37bn for the farm budget - nearly
half the entire budget amount.
It may well be that one-off compensatory payments are not in the forefront
of 'Brussels thinking'. But in budget and trade terms, and as the EU expands
eastwards, we have to find some way of eliminating export refunds altogether
and completely decoupling production from price support. If not we will
bankrupt ourselves. If the alternative to lump sum payments is the
renationalisation of the CAP - which way would the Commission go?

Frankfurt begins the first of three complete cycles tomorrow, in the staging
by Herbert Wernicke first seen in 1991 in Brussels. The conductor is Sylvain
Cambreling. London and Paris are tackling the tetralogy in two instalments.
The Royal Opera's production, conducted by Bernard Haitink and staged by
Richard Jones, starts with 'Das Rheingold' on Thursday and 'Die Walkure' on
Friday. The Chatelet in Paris completes its 'Ring' with 'Siegfried' on
Friday and 'Gotterdammerung' on Sunday, in the Jeffrey Tate-Pierre Strosser
production which opened in June.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Arts: Culture shock - Tourism is the unlikely focus of
Stephen Dorrell, the new heritage secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arts ministers, now called heritage secretaries, fall into two categories -
politicians on their way up and politicians on their way down. Only one man
actually wanted the job, David Mellor, and he left after six months. History
suggests that it is those politicians on their way down who serve the arts
better. They enjoy themselves, kick over the traces, go native and end up
fighting on behalf of every small dance troupe and community arts centre in
the land.
Britain's current heritage minister, Stephen Dorrell, who took up the post
in July, obviously has his eyes on higher ground. As former financial
secretary to the Treasury, and widely believed to have his long-term sights
set on No 11 Downing Street, he comes to the department of heritage steeped
in Treasury lore. This is doubly bad news for the arts. And in his first
public statement on Friday, Dorrell did not disappoint the pessimists.
If he is battling the Treasury hard for more money for 1994-95, he certainly
gives no indication. Arts administrators, who have been told to expect
frozen grants next year, should not anticipate a last-minute miracle. There
is no 'Gowrie dowry', the rumoured government promise to the new Arts
Council chairman, Lord Gowrie, that he could start his reign propitiously
with more subsidy.
What the minister may well do is shift around the money in his Pounds 1bn
budget between his various responsibilities. And the surprising sector that
might gain is tourism. Tourism was scarely mentioned by previous heritage
secretaries. The field was consigned to the deputy heritage minister, Iain
Sproat.
But for some reason Dorrell thinks that tourism (along with broadcasting) is
going to be the saviour of the nation's arts and heritage. Perhaps that is
why, in his first action as heritage minister, he chose to ignore the
invitation to the Edinburgh Festival in favour of the Commonwealth Games in
Canada.
Someone has drawn his attention to the fact that his rag-bag of interests -
arts, heritage, broadcasting, travel, sport - collectively generate an
annual turnover of Pounds 50bn. This looks an impressive sum when set
against Pounds 1bn in government subsidy. Why not better exploit the Pounds
49bn to boost revenue for the arts and heritage?
In practice this means encouraging more foreign tourists to visit Britain's
theatres, opera, concerts, and so on, as well as national heritage
monuments, thus increasing revenues and saving the taxpayer money. It would
be nice, too, says Dorrell, if the British chose to spend their weekends at
the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival rather than on trips to Paris.
This ignores the fact that the UK currently runs a Pounds 3bn tourism
deficit, with foreigners put off by the expense of Britain and its
unsophisticated tourist industry. It also overlooks the reality that
overseas tourists are already happy to visit the West End theatre and
heritage attractions like Madame Tussauds and Windsor Castle, which do not
receive government subsidy and hardly constitute the cultural highlands.
It will take more than the good intentions of Stephen Dorrell to divert them
to the Tricycle Theatre, Kilburn, Phoenix Dance in Leeds, the Arnolfini
Gallery in Bristol, or the hundreds of arts organisations throughout the
country which are cracking under the strain of lower subsidy, reduced
sponsorship and falling audiences.
The minister's favourite example of tourism boosting the arts, the Tate
Gallery's new satellite museum at St Ives, which almost doubled its target
of visitors to over 100,000 in its first year, is a great success story for
the seaside resort and for Cornwall, but it can hardly be repeated ad
infinitum throughout the country. There is also the problem that if tourists
do flock to visit, say, Elgar's birthplace near Worcester, their numbers
might destroy the site's appeal.
Looking to broadcasting for cultural regeneration is also starry- eyed.
Dorrell may shortly loosen controls over media ownership which, along with
advances in technology, seem certain to make broadcasting more populist and
prey to American-style commercialism. There is probably a market overseas
for BBC videos of Shakespeare, and certainly (unions willing) more artistic
events should be captured on film for a wider audience. But any gain for the
arts in the regions from such developments is not immediately obvious.
Stephen Dorrell showed his colours by stressing the role of his department
as a 'catalyst', which we all know means long on advice, short on money. The
government's 'secret agenda' on culture and the arts is now so obvious that
it can hardly be regarded as hidden. John Major confidently proclaimed last
month that 'the money raised by the (national) lottery will not replace
existing government spending'.
Perhaps not. But in the view of the Treasury it will eliminate the need for
any extra spending. That is why future grants under the three-year funding
programme across the arts and heritage have been frozen, or even reduced.
You can understand the Treasury's view. Here are these activities - arts,
heritage, sport, the Millennium Fund and charities - which are each likely
to receive Pounds 150m, rising to over Pounds 300m, a year extra from the
lottery. Surely they do not need rises in their annual grants as well? But
they do, if they are to provide any decent performances in the new buildings
that will arise from lottery cash.
It looks as if Stephen Dorrell is seeking a philosophical justification for
freezing, or even reducing slightly, his department's budget. As he says:
'The DNH is not a money fountain'. In view of his rumoured long-term
ambitions, his financial credentials would certainly be enhanced if he
presided over the stemming of his current department's cash flow: if the
department became an enabler rather than a patron.
The minister has also revealed himself a populist. He is in favour of
widening access to the arts but told the Financial Times that he was dead
against those artists (and they do exist) who maintain that it doesn't
matter if no-one is interested in their work. Dorrell's view is that if the
arts cannot sell themselves to an audience, they should not look to the
government for funding. This comes close to saying: 'It is fine to take
risks, but only if they come off.'
Dorrell is new to the job. When he has had the chance to tour the country,
visiting arts centres laying on exciting work in difficult conditions; when
he becomes familiar with the high quality performances at leading opera
houses, theatres, and concert halls; when he realises that the arts
themselves are an important industry and one of the very few in which the UK
leads the world, he may show more imagination in his approach.
At the moment his only concrete proposals - to reduce the red tape on the
building of hotels and to promote Britain more effectively overseas  - are
unlikely to raise the spirits of the currently depressed arts community,
desperately seeking an inspirational lead.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Arts: Good knight rides in for ENO - The opening of Don
Quichotte
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a year or two with its fortunes down in the dumps, English National
Opera has found a new champion to send into battle. He is grey-haired and
grizzled, a doddery old dreamer, but from the reception he received on the
opening night he is on his way to leading the company back into profit.
By the time he wrote Don Quichotte in 1910, Massenet was the grand old man
of French opera. He knew every trick in the theatrical handbook and was well
aware that chapter one begins, 'Pick a good story'. The tale of Don Quixote,
known to Parisian audiences at the time through plays based on Cervantes,
could hardly have been a happier choice for the ageing composer, himself a
pensionable knight of the theatre dreaming of his past successes.
The operas that Massenet wrote towards the end of his life are not bursting
with invention, like those of Verdi or Janacek. Pick up a score of Don
Quichotte and you might wonder where the music has gone. There are only a
few ideas left in the drawer but, master craftsman that he was, Massenet
knew exactly where to place them and how. The opera is a delicate balance of
humour and sentiment, which asks little from a producer to win fairly
certain success.
From the minute Don Quixote and Sancho Panza come on, it is clear that ENO's
production will be good entertainment. They enter riding wobbly old
tricycles, which double as warrior horses. Don Quixote's has the head of a
once noble nag, now emaciated and ready for the knacker's yard, like its
owner; Sancho Panza's is a donkey with expressive, wagging ears and a
friendly grin. They were greeted with a roar of applause.
The production team - Ian Judge (producer), John Gunter (designer) and
Deidre Clancy (costumes, brilliant and stylish, by the dozen) - have
upturned expectations. After previous encounters with Don Quichotte in the
theatre and on record, I have come away with a mental picture of the opera
in pastel colours, the silver grey of ageing hair or the distant blue of
unfulfilled dreams. Here it is the opposite, ablaze with Spanish sun-baked
yellow and flame red.
Instead of an arthritic, old man's drama, we get dancing at every
opportunity, fandangos a-plenty. Alongside seniority, the production
helpfully finds a place too for youth. When the 80-year-old Verdi wrote
Falstaff and Janacek his late operas, like The Cunning Little Vixen, they
wanted to celebrate the renewal of life, as a new generation takes over from
the old. Massenet clearly did not view the advancing years like that and Don
Quichotte sentimentally reflects on everything that old age has lost.
As the knight of the doleful countenance, Richard Van Allan captures
movingly the nobility of heart which beats on, while limbs and joints are
creaking towards their end. He looks perfect as Don Quixote (full marks to
the make-up department), though his voice these days is starting to get as
rusty as his armour. The role was written for Chaliapin, who would have made
far more of a star turn out of his dying solo, where Massenet miraculously
conjures a vision of the Island of Dreams out of almost no music at all.
A couple of the best solos go to Sancho Panza and were delivered with a
trusty, down-to-earth honesty by Alan Opie, words sharp and clear. His
homely buffo figure makes him an ideal choice as Sancho Panza. (The casting
department certainly had an eye for the right singers.) Louise Winter makes
Dulcinee a dry run for Carmen, tapping a burnished chest register and
singing with fiery charisma. Her suitors, literally so in trendy silk suits,
were a bright-voiced quartet. Emmanuel Joel conducted with plenty of vigour,
though some of the wind tuning makes the teeth grate.
Altogether, this Don Quichotte is an evening of fun - the scene where Don
Quixote charges at the windmill, gets his spear caught in the sail and flies
off out of sight is quite a coup de theatre - and touching enlightenment,
for like his weary hero, Massenet had his wisdom, too. For ENO, it comes not
a moment too soon. This is the new regime's first popular hit.
Performances until November 9.

FT  10 OCT 94 / People: Presiding over 'creative chaos' - A love of travel
led the young Peter Job to Reuters. Now, says Katharine Campbell, his empire
extends to 150 countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATHARINE CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Step into Reuters' corporate headquarters at 85 Fleet Street, London, and
the foyer - not even a clock in view - gives no hint of a pioneering media
business flashing information to 150 countries at a rate of more than 1,000
updates per second.
Meet its chief executive, Peter Job, and there is equally little evidence of
the steel you might imagine necessary to drive a company whose arrogance in
the marketplace has been a by-word among its customers.
Job reckons that the importance of the chief executive's role can be
over-stressed. A young-looking 53 in a plain white shirt, tie skewed round
revealing its Dunhill label, he hardly looks like the boss of Britain's
largest media company - turnover last year: Pounds 1.9bn; post-tax profit:
Pounds 300m.
'I'm sure the visionary entrepreneur leaping around inspiring everyone is a
perfectly good model. But it is not ours,' he says.
'He's so bloody quiet he gets overlooked,' says Sir Christopher Hogg,
Reuters' chairman, who, not surprisingly, is a great fan of the 'undramatic'
style of management.
Three-and-a-half years ago, Job, running Reuters' Asian businesses, was
picked from colleagues heading Reuters' other regional 'baronies' - David
Ure, in Europe, and Andre Villeneuve, responsible for the Americas - to
succeed Glen Renfrew, a tough Australian who was bowing out after a decade
at the top.
Reuters was suffering from the recession, new products were behind schedule,
and the likes of Telerate and Bloomberg had blossomed into fearsome
competitors. Job's task was to refocus an organisation that had long enjoyed
the luxury of behaving like a quasi-monopoly, largely ignoring its
customers' needs.
It was a measure of the management time this consumed that Reuters last year
took the unusual step of a large share repurchase, effectively handing back
Pounds 351m to shareholders. The company had been piling up cash and senior
executives felt they had insufficient time to spend it sensibly. More
recently, energies have centred on expansion, with a clutch of acquisitions
ranging from equity data system Quotron to Teknekron, a Californian software
supplier. Last week, Reuters's first radio station, London News Radio, went
on air.
In good Reuters tradition, Job is a journalist by training, despite the fact
that news these days contributes only 7 per cent of total revenues.
Information products, principally financial, make up 72 per cent of sales,
and transaction products, such as equity dealing systems, the balance.
He has spent his working life at Reuters. Between them, Job, Ure and
Villeneuve have given the company 85 years of their lives. But the young Job
claims not to have felt a vocational calling.
Following an Oxford modern languages degree, he says he applied for 'all the
usual things', flunking both the Foreign Office exams and his interview for
the BBC (he arrived an hour late). It was almost entirely because of a yen
to travel that he wound up at Reuters.
After two years' tedium in London - 'they kicked your chair periodically to
see if you were awake' - his first proper posting was Delhi. There he
relished stories about famine, turbulence and revolution, and moved to Kuala
Lumpur and Jakarta before returning to London in the late 1960s.
An 'adequate but by no means brilliant' journalist, according to a one-time
boss, Job switched into management, but not because he sensed he was marked
for higher things. 'I discovered when I returned from abroad that I was
being paid below the union minimum wage.' There followed three years in
Latin America, where he learnt to 'savour the idea of making money' rather
than following his natural inclinations to make a mark by pruning costs.
In 1978, at the age of 37, Job was put in charge of Asia, largely because he
convinced his superiors of the lunacy of managing Japan from London. He
spent all but three of the next 13 years based in Hong Kong. It was a period
of tremendous expansion. Revenues from the region, still only Pounds 41m in
1982, were Pounds 279m by 1991.
It was to his great surprise, he claims - apparently genuinely - that after
gaining a seat on the board in 1988 he was named chief executive three years
later. 'The serious new boy,' as he describes himself, settled down to
effect a change of style rather than direction.
Internally, that meant a more consensual form of management. It must be
partly down to Job - as well as to the power of the Reuters culture - that
Ure and Villeneuve did not quit in a huff, but one senses that the price for
Job's elevation is that he operates somewhat primus inter pares. 'I can't
remember taking a major initiative without consulting the top team members,'
he acknowledges. 'Except once, when I forgot. And I certainly regretted that
later.'
Job reckons that the ability to deliver better products at more or less
stable prices over a three-year period has helped Reuters' image
considerably, although efforts to decentralise, and put decision-making
nearer to the customer, have not always registered clearly with customers.
The nimble Bloomberg gets consistently higher marks in terms of
responsiveness.
One thing Job likes is constant travel. He has visited more than 70
countries since he joined Reuters. As well as keeping him in touch with
customers, travel suits his modus operandi, what Hogg describes as 'a
radar-scanner searching all parts of the business'.
It is a pretty informal style. 'I have long thought it one of the least
'managed' companies around,' says one client, adding that Job's regime
'co-exists with this extraordinary concentration of very bright people. I
suppose you could call it creative chaos.'
There are no visionary statements about the multimedia future from Job, no
platitudes from a man who distrusts management jargon. 'We see through a
glass darkly,' he says. 'We are loath to commit ourselves to a grand
strategy.' It is rather a case of 'keeping the quiver full of arrows' and
expanding in an 'opportunistic way - if that doesn't sound too derogatory'.
But surely a board composed of executive directors, only one of whom has
ever worked outside Reuters (and that not for 16 years), must be prey to
introspection in its long-term planning? Job acknowledges Hogg's
contribution. 'I simply don't know what I would do if I couldn't call on his
expertise. With the share buy-back, for instance, he undoubtedly had a
clearer view than the rest of us as to the options we faced.'
While Hogg defends Job's low-key style to the hilt, the chief executive's
unwillingness to spout on strategy, combined with a lack of presentational
skills, has perplexed the investment community, particularly in America. 'At
the beginning, every time he opened his mouth the share price went down,'
says one fund manager, who reckons colleagues are now warming to Job -
slightly.
Further down the organisation, there is a solid internal constituency that
perceives a lack of leadership, and a man 'far less approachable' than
Renfrew. Where Job gets excited about Reuters' push into television,
overstretched (and cynical, Job would say) journalists see a management out
of touch with practicalities. 'If the bomb goes up, do you file for text,
radio or TV?' asks one.
Asked whether he will be the last journalist to run Reuters, Job paused
lengthily and gave no clear answer. But what he has to demonstrate is that
it is not necessarily the most glamorous types who best run the most
fashionable and exciting companies.
Or perhaps, given Reuters' collective experience at the top, the task is
less complex than it looks. According to Hogg: 'Reuters has been in the
right place at the right time. The great thing is not to blow that.'

FT  10 OCT 94 / People (Names in the News): Lee Hsien Yang moves up at ST
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The hottest item of news on the Singapore business circuit in recent days
has been the rapid rise in the island republic's corporate world of Lee
Hsien Yang, a son of Lee Kuan Yew, writes Kieran Cooke.
Lee junior has been appointed to the new position of deputy president of
Singapore Telecom (ST), Singapore's biggest listed company.
Lee Hsien Yang, who is in his late 30's, only joined ST six months ago.
Corporate analysts predict that before too long he could take over as chief
executive at ST. Singapore's telecommunications conglomerate, which is 90
per cent controlled by the government, has a market capitalisation of about
Dollars 36bn (a figure similar to that of British Telecom) though its sales
last year amounted to only Dollars 1.8bn.
Lee Hsien Yang is a graduate of Cambridge and Stanford. He is a brigadier
general, and before joining ST was head of the Singapore army's joint
operations and planning directorate.
His elder brother, Lee Hsien Loong, also an army brigadier general, is now
deputy prime minister and is generally seen as the most likely candidate to
succeed Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister.

FT  10 OCT 94 / People (Names in the News): Taking the reins at AlliedSignal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ralph Reins, president of AlliedSignal Automotive and one of the leading
executives in the US automotive components industry, is leaving the group to
'pursue career interests' outside the company, writes Kevin Done.
He is to be replaced by John Barter, who has been senior vice president and
chief financial officer of the AlliedSignal group since 1988 and has headed
the company's planning, development and administration functions.
Reins has worked for many leading US components suppliers including Rockwell
International, ITT Automotive, where he was chief executive from 1987 to
1989, and United Technologies Automotive, where he was president from 1990
to 1991. Between 1989 and 1990 he was chief executive of Mack Trucks, the US
heavy truck-maker which is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Renault of
France.
Reins has led a significant turnround of AlliedSignal's automotive
operations, which had a turnover of Dollars 4.5bn last year accounting for
around 38 per cent of total group turnover of Dollars 11.8bn.

FT  10 OCT 94 / People (Names in the News): LeFauve makes small bigger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Skip' LeFauve, head of General Motors' Saturn division, simply can't build
enough cars at the moment, writes Richard Waters. The US automaker's
specialist small cars division, set up in the late 1980s to compete head-on
with Japanese imports, has been running full-tilt in recent months to keep
up with demand.
Saturn's success in designing and building cars that Americans want to buy
(it hasn't turned a profit yet) has now propelled LeFauve up the GM
executive ladder. Last week, the 59-year old career GM employee was given
responsibility for all of the group's small cars.
This gives him charge of the Lansing division, which makes roughly three
times as many vehicles as Saturn's 300,000 a year.
LeFauve (his nickname was supplied by a mariner grandfather) draws plaudits
from analysts for making the Saturn experiment a success. The message he has
hammered home all along is that the company will stay small.
As he told one interviewer, Saturn 'won't be a huge company, or get too big
for its breeches'.
Recently, though, LeFauve has been clamouring for more investment to lift
the division's production capacity. But with Dollars 5bn already sunk in the
venture, and no profit yet in sight, the GM top brass has so far failed to
respond.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Media Futures: Time Warner puts three titles on-line
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Time Warner, the media and entertainment giant, plans to put three of its
best-know magazines - People, Sports Illustrated and Fortune - on
CompuServe, the largest commercial on-line information service.
The publications have a combined circulation of nearly 7.4m and are the
biggest of their sort to enter the 'cyberworld' of interactive electronic
distribution.
About 200 special interest magazines are already available to computer users
who connect to information services, according to Magazine Publishers of
America, an industry trade group.
However, the on-line editions of People, Sports Illustrated and Fortune will
feature some innovations, including photographs and advertising, in addition
to the full text of the print editions.
Magazines are setting the pace in electronic publishing in the US because of
their national readerships. Most newspapers, in contrast, are regional.
The project is the latest of several experiments that Time Warner has made
with electronic publishing. Time, the group's flagship magazine, went
electronic in September last year via America Online, a fast-growing
service. Over the past year Time Online has logged about 3m readers.
Reading magazines on a computer screen is more expensive and cumbersome than
purchasing the printed editions, but a big attraction seems to be the
ability to engage in on-line discussion of articles and issues with
journalists and other readers.
For example, CompuServe members who access People, Sports Illustrated or
Fortune will be able to participate in forums in which they can quiz the
magazines' writers, exchange messages with news-makers featured in the
magazines and chat on-line with other readers.
For publishers, this presents many challenges. But the prospect of reaching
tens of thousands of new readers on-line is too enticing to be ignored.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Media Futures: Bringing maturity to swashbuckling Sun / A
look at changes planned by Phillip Samper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a company with a reputation for the kind of brashness and aggression
that frightens the giants of the computer industry, Sun Microsystems has
been uncommonly quiet of late.
That should change once Phillip Samper, appointed president of Sun's
computer systems division (SMCC) at the beginning of the year, gets his
business strategy for the division up and running. Multimedia and networking
are important elements in his plans.
Sun, a California-based workstation manufacturer, is already a key
contributor to the Internet, the global web of interconnected computers and
computer networks which has some 25m users. Sun was an early adopter of the
rules which have to be followed to transmit data on the Internet.
As a consequence, it reckons that as much as 56 per cent of Internet traffic
runs on its computers, while most of the software written to help users find
their way round the network - applications with names like Mosaic, Archie
and Gopher - was developed on Sun systems.
The potential of the Internet, however, is often lost on users who find the
business of making the connection difficult, expensive and time-consuming.
Last week, Sun announced new kinds of computers that it describes as
Internet servers which will make it easy for untrained users to find their
way on to and around the Internet. The servers - microcomputers costing
between Pounds 6,000 and Pounds 13,500 - essentially take the user
step-by-step through the connection process. Sun has been a pioneer in
exploiting the commercial possibilities of the Internet and is a member of
CommerceNet, an industry consortium working on the creation of an electronic
marketplace over the Net. Now live, it is expected to offer electronic
shopping and banking soon.
There is a less serious side to Sun's Internet activities: recently it
worked with Thinking Pictures, a spin-off from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology Media Lab, to create an Internet database for the Rolling
Stones' 'Voodoo Lounge' concert tour. Stored on the database are concert
dates, video and audio clips of the band at work, and a library of
photographs.
SMCC is Sun's principal operating division, a company with no scruples about
telling larger competitors like International Business Machines and Digital
Equipment that it intends to grow by eating their lunch (taking market share
from them). Scott McNealy, founder and chairman, relishes what he describes
as the company's 'in-your-face' attitude. Samper is more moderate. He calls
it 'swashbuckling'. He is not the most obvious choice as leader of a
technical workstation manufacturer. Fifty nine in February, he was formerly
vice-chairman of Eastman Kodak. During his 28 years with Kodak he led the
photographic and information management division and managed Kodak's
operations internationally.
He does, however, have experience as a purchaser and user of corporate
computer systems, and has been on Sun's board of directors since 1991. Kodak
was at one point an investor in Sun.
The company is at a critical point in its development. Founded in 1982, Sun
grew rapidly and profitably through the 1980s by building workstations -
hugely powerful personal computers used by scientists and engineers - that
were demonstrably faster than the competition. The secret was a
microprocessor chip called 'Sparc'. Today, Sun is still the leader in
workstations with a 37.8 per cent share of the market - ahead of
Hewlett-Packard (19.6 per cent) and DEC (11.1 per cent).
Analysts worry, however, that other chips such as 'PowerPC' from IBM and
'Alpha' from DEC have leap-frogged ahead of Sparc. One answer from the
Californian company has been to seek an extensive alliance with Fujitsu of
Japan - a world leader in chip manufacturing technology - to design and
build faster and better versions of Sparc.
Samper, however, believes that management changes are just as important, as
the company moves past the psychologically important Dollars 5bn revenue
point. 'We have to find ways of keeping the spirit of a small company with
the management structure of a large one,' he says.
He makes two comments: 'First, Sun has to understand the global market
better. Silicon Valley companies often have two problems - understanding
there is a US market outside Silicon Valley and understanding there is a
world market outside the US. Second, Sun needs a different approach to
marketing and in particular to advertising and public relations.'
At present, it spends only Dollars 15m or Dollars 20m a year on advertising
and the like: a relic of Sun's origins in technical computing where
recommendations were passed on by word of mouth. Competitors spend up to 10
times more, and Samper is anxious to see a substantial increase in Sun's
advertising budget.
His principal role, however, is to inject experience and maturity into a
young and ambitious management team. 'We have to learn that swashbuckling is
not the answer to business; business is the answer to business.'
He argues that executives in fast-growing companies become expert at fire
fighting but do not spent enough time on fire prevention. An example: the
financial hiccough Sun suffered around the turn of the decade when, of all
things, its computer-based accounting system proved inadequate. The problem
has been rectified and the new system is continually upgraded. 'God willing,
we will never have that problem again,' says Semper with feeling.
He believes that Sun will be a leader in each of the key technologies over
the next few years. He argues, for example, that the likely winners of the
microprocessor wars will be Intel (probably in conjunction with Hewlett
Packard), IBM, Motorola and Apple with PowerPC and the Sun Sparc.
In operating systems, Microsoft will be represented by Windows NT or a
variant, IBM by OS/2 and Sun by Solaris, thepackaged version of Sun's Unix
operating software.
In the key area of object-oriented technology, which many see as the future
of computer programming, there will be Microsoft's Cairo, Taligent from IBM,
Apple and Hewlett Packard and NextStep from Steve Jobs' Next group. Sun has
a 10 per cent stake in Next.
However, the low-margin PC business is one battlefield that Sun seems
unlikely to invade. 'We keep looking at PCs, but I have to be certain we can
make money there,' says Semper.

A strong undersea earthquake shook northern Japan yesterday, but there were
no reports of damage or injuries. It was thought to have been an aftershock
from the 8.2-magnitude quake last Tuesday, which killed at least 10 people
in the Russian-occupied Kuril Islands, just north of Japan, and caused 228
injuries in northern Japan from broken glass and falling objects.
Television reporters speaking from towns in Hokkaido said there were no
signs of damage.

<TEXT>
Teams of youngsters positioned themselves at road junctions around Belgium
on Saturday, urging drivers to apologise to fellow road users instead of
blasting their horns. It was part of a national 'courteous driving day'.
The campaign, sponsored by an insurance company, aims to reduce noise
generated by irate drivers, and to tackle one of western Europe's highest
road-accident fatality rates. New statistics show an annual death rate from
road accidents of 45 people per 100,000 vehicles in Belgium. Within the
European Union, only Portugal, Greece and Ireland have worse rates.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Business Travel (Update): Plan to ban smoking
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US House of Representatives has voted to ban smoking on all
international flights to and from the US, but the measure may fail one it
reaches the Senate.
Smoking was outlawed four years ago on all US domestic flights except those
lasting six hours or more. The House bill would extend the ban to those
flights. It now goes to the Senate, but an aide said no action was expected
this year.

There are expectations of a fare war between Asian airlines, following
Singapore Airlines' announcement that it is cutting fares for first- and
business-class seats on regional and some intercontinental routes by 10-20
per cent, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur. A return Singapore-Hong Kong
business-class trip on SIA will fall to SDollars 1,770 (Pounds 753) from
SDollars 2,082.
Other carriers in the region are expected to follow SIA's example.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Business Travel: Nice view - shame about the crush / Joel
Kibazo flew to the recently opened Kansai International airport in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a clear day, Kansai International must be one of the world's most
spectacular sights from the air. Japan's new airport, which opened five
weeks ago, is on a man-made island about 2 1/2 miles offshore of Osaka.
The terminal building, which stretches for just over a mile, is encased in
glass, with white metal bars to support it. The airport, which took seven
years and Pounds 9.2bn to build, is the only man-made structure other than
the Great Wall of China to be visible from space.
Yet for all the architectural splendour of the building, created by Italian
designer Renzo Piano and his team, not enough attention has been paid to the
needs - or foibles - of travellers.
Leaving the aircraft to enter the airport, you encounter easy-to-follow
directions - so long as you are fluent in Japanese or English. There are no
signs in French, German or Arabic - which seems an oversight, given that a
large proportion of those using Kansai are likely to be international
business travellers.
On your way to the baggage hall, you may appreciate the bright yellow and
orange chairs which you pass in the boarding lounge. But then you hit the
arrivals hall. There is so little space that you have to squeeze - or at
times fight - your way through the waiting hordes.
Your fellow passengers are not your only problem. The new airport has become
a tourist attraction for locals, so if you land at Kansai over the next few
weekends, you will have to make your way through crowds of gawpers. The
Kansai authorities claim that sightseers pose no problem, but the long
queues at each restaurant and the piles of rubbish outside the main airport
terminal were evidence of the extra 300,000 people that had visited Kansai
one weekend recently.
Having made it through arrivals, there is an information desk to the left of
the exit where staff are keen to help with further directions. Hotel and
ticket information is available at an adjoining desk (the main airport hotel
does not open until next year).
Just in front of this desk are two small bureaux de change. But there is
only one window at each, so if two flights arrive within a few minutes of
each other, long queues spill into the road.
Two expressways link the airport to Osaka, so leaving the airport is not
difficult. There are plenty of buses, coaches and taxis outside, though the
Pounds 50 cab fare to Osaka may come as a bit of a shock to first-time
visitors.
The authorities are keen to encourage use of rail connections. The station
is close to the terminal, and buying a ticket is easy. After you have bought
your ticket, however, and are waiting for your train, you may feel less
enthusiastic. You could have an hour or so to wait, and there are no seats
for tired travellers to use.
Delays of that length may persist for as long as sightseers continue to be
drawn to Kansai. The cleanliness and swivel-seats of the trains themselves
may offer some compensation.
Flying out of Kansai is relatively straightforward. For those who do not
speak English or Japanese there are information machines that speak other
languages.
Be prepared for the stiff departure tax - euphemistically called 'airport
facilities charge' - which is Pounds 17. And count on almost everything,
from beer to hamburgers, to be expensive. The choice of drinks or cigarettes
at the few duty-free shops is limited, with only the dearest brands on
offer.
Many international airlines have started flying to Kansai, which is designed
to serve as a hub for passengers to Australia and elsewhere. Japan Airlines
is its biggest user to date, with the greatest number of flights from
Europe, including four from London and three from Paris each week. British
Airways has two flights a week from London. Surprisingly, All Nippon
Airways, the other big Japanese carrier, has yet to start direct flights
from Europe to Kansai.
The big Japanese airlines have direct links from the new airport to Tokyo.
But the flight takes 45 minutes, so use Kansai only if you are heading for
the Kansai region. And remember to enjoy the view.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Business Travel: Vital statistics on visas - Do you need one
for the US? Michael Skapinker explains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do you need a visa to visit the US? It depends.
The Visa Waiver Program allowed many travellers to go to the US without a
visa. The programme expired at the beginning of this month, but it continues
to apply until the end of October. There is every chance that it will
continue after that, but it is best to check at the end of the month.
Another problem is that, if you do need a visa, from tomorrow you have to
pay to apply. You do not pay at the US embassy, however. You pay at Barclays
Bank.
Confused? You are not alone. Let's go through this slowly.
1. Do I need a visa to travel to the US?
Yes, unless you are a citizen of Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Brunei, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg,
Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, San Marino, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland or the UK. If you are not a citizen of one of these countries,
go to question 6. If you are a citizen of one of the above, move on to
question 2.
2. So that means I don't need a visa?
Possibly not. But read the whole of this answer first.
You might need a visa if you also plan to visit Mexico, Canada or the
Caribbean. If you do, go to question 4.
You will also need a visa if you plan to visit the US for more than 90 days.
In which case go to question 6.
You will need a visa if you are a government official, journalist on
assignment, part of an airline crew, or studying in the US. If so, go to
question 6.
If none of these applies, check you do not fall foul of the provisions in
question 3.
3. So I am of the right nationality and I am not a government official or
journalist. What is the problem now?
You still need to submit a visa application if you have ever been afflicted
with a serious communicable disease or a dangerous physical or mental
disorder, or if you have ever been a drug abuser, addict, drug trafficker,
prostitute or procurer. Similarly, you need to apply for a visa if you have
ever been arrested for or convicted of any offence, or if you plan to enter
the US to break the law. You also need a visa if you had Nazi connections
during the second world war.
If you fall into any of these categories, go to question 6. If not, go to
question 5.
4. I plan to visit a neighbouring country as well as the US. Do I need a US
visa?
Not if you have a ticket home. Go to question 5.
If you have an onward ticket to a neighbouring country but no ticket home,
you will need a visa unless you are a res-ident of that country. Go to
question 6.
5. Good. So I really don't need a visa?
No you don't. But you still need to arrive in the US with evidence of the
purpose of your visit, of funds to support yourself and your plans to go
home.
6. So I need a visa. What next?
From tomorrow, you will need to pay a fee after getting your visa
application form but before submitting it. In the UK, the fee is Pounds
13.75. It is non-returnable, whether you get the visa or not. The fee cannot
be paid to the US embassy. In the UK, it should be paid in cash at a branch
of Barclays - other banks may accept payment but might charge a fee. In
other countries, ask the US embassy if the fee has come into effect and
where you have to pay it.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Media Futures: Two clear ways for managers to increase
profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Which of the new telecommunications services now on offer will give managers
the best chance of increasing their profitability?
OTR Group, a consultancy based in London and Brussels, has been
investigating this question over the past two years and concludes that two -
virtual private networks and nationwide fibre-optic networking - 'stand out
like beacons'.
The first, OTR says, will enable large cost savings. The second offers the
promise of new services where some companies could make large profits in the
not too distant future. The conclusions of OTR's report* will be welcomed by
managers attracted by the excitement over multimedia and the information
superhighway but dazzled by the options open to them.
'They have no intention of going on a technology buying binge in a
fast-moving area of which they know little,' says OTR.
Virtual private networks (VPNs) are an alternative to private leased lines
and can work out 30 per cent cheaper. VPN is a form of outsourcing. The
telecommunications carrier operates the network on behalf of the customer,
almost certainly be a medium-sized or large business.
According to OTR's figures, a VPN works out cheaper than private networks if
the volume of traffic over the network is less than 2,000 minutes a day. The
advantages from VPN include least cost routing - a call between the
Amsterdam and London offices of a company, for example, would be charged
only at local London rates. Holiday Inn Worldwide spends Dollars 425m with
AT&amp;T on VPN services and reckons to benefit by a 40 per cent discount on
tariffs, depending on
volume.
National fibre optic networks or information superhighways, are likely to be
aimed chiefly at consumers. OTR has identified nine product categories for
the superhighway, of which the first eight are consumer driven -
video-on-demand, home shopping, home information, games, home financial
services, videotelephony, education, news and medicine.
According to OTR, business needs are already being met by conventional
communications: 'There is not sufficient new demand from the business
community to warrant the installation of a national fibre-optic network.'
This conflicts with the commonly held view that business will be first to
see the benefits of, and be prepared to pay for, information travelling on
the superhighway.
OTR sees the first beneficiaries of a national fibre optic network as
service companies replacing, for example, expensive professional consultancy
with videos explaining financial or legal matters.
It estimates 2005 as the year when the superhighway will be fully
operational in the US, Europe and Japan, but argues that the business
benefits will start to trickle through by as early as
1995.

FT  10 OCT 94 / FT guide to corruption in France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France has been hit this year by a wave of high-profile corruption
investigations. Who has been affected, and how high have the investigations
reached?
The striking feature of the corruption investigations is that they have
involved some of France's leading businessmen and senior politicians. So far
this year, one cabinet minister, Alain Carignon, the communications
minister, has resigned following a corruption probe. Gerard Longuet, the
industry minister, faces pressure to resign following an investigation into
payments for his holiday home in Saint Tropez. And colleagues from his
Republican Party have been cited in probes concerning illicit political
funding. The chairmen of some of France's leading companies, including Saint
Gobain, Alcatel Alsthom and Schneider, have also been placed under
investigation in cases involving alleged fraud or influence peddling.
Why has there been such a surge in corruption cases?
These investigations are not new in France. In the 1980s, for example, the
Socialist party found itself the target of investigations, following the
discovery of Urba, a national network of bogus consultancies which
channelled money from business contractors to the party's coffers. But the
snaring of senior figures reflects a more aggressive approach by France's
investigating magistrates, who have been influenced, according to some
observers, by the experience of Italy's corruption-hunting judges. At the
same time, the decentralisation of decision-making to the provinces over the
past decade has increased opportunities for corruption.
Is corruption widespread? Is France like Italy?
Prime minister Edouard Balladur firmly rejects the comparison. 'Corruption
in France is nothing like the situation in Italy', he said earlier this
month, arguing that the spree of investigations reflected the increased
freedom of the judiciary to pursue cases which largely date back to the
1980s. He is probably right to dismiss the parallel. But the extent of the
problem in France does appear significant. A poll by Le Monde last month
found that two out of three French company chairmen suspect that illegal
practices are common in the business world, while a study by Le Nouvel
Observateur, the weekly magazine, claims there are more than 60 ongoing
corruption investigations into businessmen and politicians.
Is there a common thread to the various probes?
Often, yes. The investigations into Saint Gobain, Cogedim, the property
developer, and utilities companies all involve alleged links to a
politician, a political party or a public contract. The cases often involve
accusations that contracts were awarded in return for political funds. The
investigation into Carignon, for example, includes allegations that a
utilities company bailed out a publishing group which supported his
electoral campaigns in return for a water supply contract in Grenoble.
Alcatel and Schneider are different. In the former case, the chairman is
accused of using company funds for building work at his private properties.
In the latter, a Belgian magistrate claims that the chairman short-changed
minority shareholders in the group's Belgian subsidiaries through a series
of offshore companies.
What are the political implications? Does the spate of investigations
represent a threat to the government?
The various cases represent a growing dilemma for the prime minister.
Balladur's presidential ambitions depend partly on the support of Longuet
and his Republican Party, the biggest element in the UDF, the junior partner
in the ruling coalition. Should Longuet be forced to resign, and should his
party be dragged more deeply into corruption investigations, the prime
minister would be deprived of a potentially important ally in his bid for
the conservative candidacy in the presidential poll. More broadly, the fact
that the political right is now in the firing line could damage its standing
with voters, in the same way that a perception of corruption contributed to
the Socialist party's heavy defeat in last year's general elections.
How is the government responding, and what reforms are necessary to resolve
the problem?
Balladur's initial response was to let the investigations work their course.
But he has come under increasing pressure to take further action and is now
proposing an annual audit of the personal assets of ministers, MPs and
senior local officials. Several influential politicians, including Pierre
Mehaignerie, the justice minister, have raised the prospect of a complete
ban on corporate funding for political parties, thereby extending
legislation of 1988 and 1990, which set limits on contributions and limited
spending by candidates in elections. The two principal options are: to
establish a system in which the French state picks up the tab for the
country's politicking, with a direct and controlled system of financing for
political parties; or to introduce a buffer between individual companies and
politicians through the creation of foundations to receive general corporate
donations, as happens in Germany.

<TEXT>
Another fruitful venture into the EMI archives has resulted in a vibrant new
collection of works by Sir William Walton, all conducted by the composer.
The Walton Edition, a four-CD set of remastered recordings which have never
appeared before on CD, includes a stirring account of the composer's First
Symphony; both the violin and viola concertos performed by Yehudi Menuhin;
and the Johannesburg Festival Overture. Those looking for patriotic fervour
will enjoy the recording Walton made with Sir Laurence Olivier of scenes
from Henry V, its first complete appearance since it was released on 78.
Joe Jackson's first album for three years, Night Music (Virgin), is a
continuation of his excursions into alien - for a traditional pop star  -
territory, featuring a pleasing variety of styles and compositional
approaches. While there is a touch of pretension about an album containing
four 'nocturnes', there is little doubt that Jackson has always been a more
legitimate cross-over artist than most, showing little regard for fads.
And now for something . . . Python mania shows no sign of abating, with the
release of the six-CD box set The Instant Monty Python CD Collection by
Virgin. If you think that is a little over-the-top, The Ultimate Monty
Python Rip-Off contains highlights, though it is hard to imagine how anyone
can keep getting a laugh from listening to the Lumberjack Song over and over
again.
Briefly: the Cambridge Singers celebrate four centuries of music written for
multiple choirs on A Banquet of Voices (Collegium), including works by
Allegri, Bach and Brahms; Martin Souter tackles another set of Bach chorale
preludes on the famous 1696 Noordbroek Schnitger organ (Isis); Bon Jovi
continue to wave the flag for hard rock with a collection of their greatest
hits, Cross Road - The Best of Bon Jovi (Mercury); and Elton John and Tim
Rice collaborate on the sound-track to Walt Disney's The Lion King
(Mercury).

FT  10 OCT 94 / Sport: Life after the Olympic ring cycle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Olympic gold medals are tricky. Or rather, life after a gold medal can be
tricky. Like an Oxbridge degree, gold medals open doors. But what happens
next depends to a large degree on the ability of the athlete to translate
commitment and drive into new fields, yet retain the humility of a beginner.
Many believe they can walk on water - and promptly sink. 'In the outside
world it's important to recognise your own limitations. Sports people are
very bad at that,' says Chris Boardman, the young and virtually unknown
British track cyclist who won a gold medal two years ago at the Barcelona
Olympics. 'That's because, when you're competing, it's essential to believe
you can do anything.'
During their event, Olympic champions admit no doubts. But Boardman's career
may have entered a new phase on Saturday with the inaugural meeting at
Britain's new Pounds 9m velodrome in Manchester, where he triumphed over
Francis Moreau of France in a fascinating re-match with the man he beat in
Sicily recently to become world 4,000 metres pursuit champion.
In the afternoon's other crowd-pleaser, Yvonne McGregor, winner of Britain's
only cycling gold at this year's Commonwealth Games, was beaten by world
pursuit champion Marion Clignet.
Although the fact was well-disguised from the public, neither event would
have happened without the involvement of Boardman wearing, for the first
time, a promoter's hat. Five weeks ago the original promoters withdrew from
the meeting. As this is Britain's first-ever purpose-built, indoor cycling
stadium, it may be safe to assume that Britain's market for indoor sprint
events is relatively untested.
Many people have warned the British Cycling Federation, which is now based
in the vast Manchester stadium and will pay its considerable operating
costs, that it may have been handed a poisoned chalice. What is certain is
that an inaugural event without stars, consisting of largely unknown amateur
riders in national teams, would have given the velodrome a send-off to match
that of the Titanic.
'Chris would have ridden in the English team, but to be honest it might have
seemed a bit like Linford Christie jogging in the park on a Sunday,' said
Peter Woodworth, who is Boardman's business mentor and co-director of Beyond
Level Four, the company they established to maximise Boardman's potential.
'I brought Francis and the two girls here to add a bit of sparkle to what
should be a very special event for British cycling,' says Boardman, 26. 'It
sounds corny but it is a chance to put something back into the sport.
However, once I started to be involved in doing this, I began to think that
in time my company could have a future in sports promotion.'
After his Barcelona triumph - riding that futuristic carbon-fibre bicycle
built by Lotus - the popular media made much of Boardman's status as an
unemployed cabinet-maker launched into sports fame. Is it not an even bigger
step in just two years from dole queue to becoming the Mr Fixit of Europe's
velodromes?
'The dole business was a myth with some truth in it,' says Boardman, who
possesses a remarkably analytical mind. 'I had decided to give up my job in
order to invest the time in training to be an international sportsman.'
That decision paid off, but others lay ahead. 'When they hang it around your
neck, you know your gold medal has the potential to give you security for
life, but it all depends on how you use it. It's a desperately big
responsibility. At the start I avoided making any decisions because I was
too afraid of making a mistake.'
Ironically, among Boardman's priorities was to remain an amateur. 'It's a
horrendously hard life as a professional cyclist and I wanted to stay in my
comfy niche,' he says.
However, Peter Woodworth, an ex-cyclist from the same Merseyside club as
Boardman (although a generation older) and a businessman, persuaded the gold
medallist that he could not stand still in the relatively tiny world of
amateur sprint cycling.
Last season Boardman made his Tour de France debut in the prestigious Gan
team. Wearing the legendary maillot jeune (yellow jersey) after the first
stage was the stuff of fantasy, yet it happened. Although he stopped short
of the mountain stages, Gan were impressed enough with the newcomer to plan
next season's road-racing team around the Englishman.
Rumours that Boardman is now earning the Pounds 1m a year paid to retired
team-leader Greg LeMond are laughed off. But Woodworth agrees that next year
his protege will be the best-paid second-year professional on the Tour.
Boardman says he is financially on target to retire when he is 32 - but
won't, because he is a happily self-diagnosed workaholic.
My final question had to be about that name. Beyond Level Four? It sounds
like something from the further reaches of software engineering, or a San
Francisco PR company. It emerges that Boardman has for years prepared for
races on a unique four-level training regime. The first level is a simple
'recovery ride', the fourth 'a period of maximal intensity'.
'The name means a lot to us,' he said. 'We don't yet know what's beyond
Level Four.' And then he laughed.

<TEXT>
There is an old movie adage that when all else fails - or when all else has
succeeded but you need a fresh gimmick - you should send your characters
into the desert.
There you will find eye-catching scenery, limitless horizons and a licence
to conjure mirages. Many people at Cannes this year thought The Adventures
Of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert was a mirage. A comedy of cross-dressing
from macho Australia? And a funny one?
It fast became the hit of the festival. It revives Terence Stamp's career at
a stroke - he plays one of three drag queens whose hired bus breaks down in
the Outback, causing many an unexpected encounter and adventure - and
provides the wittiest, most off-the-wall gay movie since La Cage Aux Folles.
Priscilla opens this Friday. Disney's The Lion King opened last Friday and
is already swallowing large audiences whole. This desert is African and the
most spectacular cartoon landscape of modern times. Thrill to the stampeding
wildebeest. Gasp at the burning plains patrolled by lions and hyenas. And
relish Jeremy Irons' suave turn as the wicked lion uncle, obviously reared
on old George Sanders films when he was a cub.
Zhang Yimou's To Live, from the director of Red Sorghum and Ju Dou, is
another of China's revisionist epics about Chinese history: 30 years in the

claims exhaustive historical authenticity and has Gene Hackman and Robert
Duvall in the supporting cast.

Cracker (Monday, 9-10pm, ITV) returns for an encore which is shorter than
ITV would have liked. Writer Jimmy McGovern has decided to restrict himself
to half the number of episodes Granada wanted to commission.
Robbie Coltrane fizzes as Fitz the hard-drinking, big-gambling forensic
psychologist who, in the first episode, gets to grips with a bereaved father
seeking revenge for his son, who died in the Hillsborough tragedy.
An absorbing documentary on Porton Down in Network First (Tuesday,
10.40-11.40pm, ITV) details Porton's leading role in developing chemical
weapons since the start of this century. Porton Down also appears to have
benefitted from data collected by Nazis in the concentration camps.
The programme-makers have unearthed evidence of experiments performed on
human volunteers which have left them riddled with disease and, in one case,
dead. Many of the British volunteers have suffered quietly for years, having
been sworn to silence by the Official Secrets Act.
However, Porton Down's US counterpart has started paying compensation to its
human guinea pigs, which has resulted in a trickle of information that the
documentary traces to its source with astonishing results.
Jazz fans should tune in for Alan Plater's Screen One: Doggin' Around
(Sunday, 10.05-11.35pm, BBC1), with Ronnie Scott playing himself, Elliott
Gould as a has-been pianist and Geraldine James as his minder. It combines
Plater's two obsessions - jazz and the north of England - and he has a lot
of fun with in-jokes, some of them so obtuse that only aficionados will get
them all.

Soccer: October 12. Friendly: England v Romania.
Matthew Le Tissier is hotly tipped to make his full England debut in this
match. Southampton's gifted forward has so far been limited to substitute
appearances for his country. But injuries to England internationals Darren
Anderton (Tottenham) and David Platt (Sampdoria) mean Le Tissier is likely
to start the game.
'Darren and David have been influential figures since I took over,'
England's manager Terry Venables said last week. 'But he (Le Tissier) has
started the season superbly; he is more impressive than ever.'
The evening also sees European championship games in which Scotland are at
home to the Faroe Islands and Wales away to Moldova. Other European
championship games on October 12: Austria v Northern Ireland, Republic of
Ireland v Liechtenstein, Denmark v Belgium, Macedonia v Spain, Turkey v
Iceland, Switzerland v Sweden, Ukraine v Slovenia, Greece v Finland, Russia
v San Marino, Malta v Czech Republic, Belarus v Luxembourg, Norway v
Netherlands, Bulgaria v Georgia, Poland v Azerbaijan, Israel v Slovakia,
Netherlands v Germany.

Rugby union: October 12, Wales v Italy (World Cup ranking game), Cardiff.
October 15, South Africa v Argentina, Johannesburg.
Italy, an improving rugby nation, takes on one whose recent revival seems to
have faltered. The Italians beat Romania easily in an earlier match in the
group, while Wales only scraped by in Bucharest - a win which was typical of
recent victories, encouraging but narrow.
Since then Wales have lost skipper Ieuan Evans, the match winner against
Romania, to injury, and Scott Quinnell, their energetic back-row forward, to
rugby league.
                        *      *      *
Golf: October 13-16, World Matchplay, Wentworth.
Severiano Ballesteros, who has won the event five times, was spurned when
invitations were first handed out. The insult seems to have inspired a
return to form. He is in as a replacement for John Daly and the weekend
promises the entertaining sight of Ballesteros trying to extract revenge for
the slight by humiliating everyone concerned.
                        *      *      *
Motor racing: October 16, European Grand Prix, Jerez, Spain.
Two more slighted heroes return. Michael Schumacher (Benetton), banned for
the last two races, holds only a one-point lead over Damon Hill, even though
Hill has not beaten Schumacher this season in any race in which both have
finished. And Nigel Mansell returns from IndyCar racing in the US for the
last three grands prix of the season. Mansell, the 1992 world champion, will
join Hill in the Williams team, and will want to show he is still
competitive in a Formula One car.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Management: Business lessons on the timetable - Companies
should aim for more efficient links with education to improve the supply of
skilled employees, their quality of life and employability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Growing concern that education systems are failing to deliver a sufficient
flow of good quality business recruits has been voiced around the world for
several years. Companies are now more prepared to do something about it.
In the UK, the greatest worry is a lack of scientists. Provisional figures
suggest that UK universities have failed to fill all the places available on
science degree courses this year, despite reducing the academic attainment
targets required from applicants.
Research by Motorola, the US-based electronics group, and Cellnet, the UK
mobile telephone operator, suggests that schools and teachers are
exacerbating this problem. It found that 85 per cent of teachers thought
students found science and technology difficult. Only 29 per cent of the
students agreed.
Evidence like this has persuaded a growing number of companies to invest
directly in education. In the UK alone, a survey by the London School of
Economics shows that 80 per cent of UK companies intend to continue or
extend school links in the next three years. Since 1988, 57 per cent of
companies have increased their involvement with secondary schools.
However, the Confederation of British Industry is concerned that this
activity - which is new territory for many businesses - is being managed
inefficiently. This month it published a new code of practice on
education-business links - including involvement in preparing curriculum
materials and work experience for pupils - and launched a campaign to
persuade all its members to build such links by the year 2000. It also wants
all primary and secondary schools to establish relations with at least one
business.
The CBI also advised companies to use performance indicators to measure
their educational involvement. Only 14 per cent of the companies surveyed by
the LSE did so.
This is not philanthropic. The CBI believes that the links will not merely
improve the long-term supply of recruits. In the shorter term, companies can
teach new skills to existing employees and use the experience of students
involved in enterprise projects to experiment with management techniques.
'Employees - as much as students - should participate in links to improve
their quality of life, their employability and their specific skills,' it
says.
Such a strategy would also help attract and retain recruits. Graduates, in
particular, are now looking for employers who can provide extra skills,
rather than a secure job or a large salary.
A conference held last month in London by the Student Industrial Society,
which promotes industrial careers to students, found that students
overwhelmingly looked for companies to teach them 'marketable, transferable
skills', with 81 per cent saying they would expect this of any company. More
traditional concerns were far less important, with only 11 per cent
expecting companies to deliver a 'career for life'.
The CBI's proposals on 'best practice' are influenced by experience from the
US, outlined at the International Conference on Education-Business
Partnership in Paris earlier this year by David Stern, a researcher with the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Stern identified
three 'stages' of links between businesses and schools and a momentum which
leads each to develop into the next.
These are:
Resources for Education
At this level, support for education is a sophisticated form of public
relations. Companies provide materials free of charge, in return for
positive publicity, or send employees to give talks to schools. This
satisfies employers' basic 'enlightened self-interest'.
However, these partnerships soon become more complex, as they do not give
students actual experience of working, and do not teach them how to use the
workplace as a 'place of learning'.
This leads to:
Placements for Learners
Employers allow students work experience in return for low wages. Several
continental European nations have highly developed 'dual' training systems
where trainees spend most of the week in supervised training with the
company, but also spend time at a state-funded school, studying general
theory to back their vocational work.
In the US, the trend is more towards 'career academies' set up within
schools, of which there are now around 150 (see accompanying piece). Each
academy is organised as a 'school within a school', allowing a group of
students to take a distinct sequence of courses together, and covers a broad
vocational theme, such as health, or computer-related jobs. Narrow trade
specialisms are avoided.
These academies are used by their host schools to enlist active involvement
from local employers, who help to formulate the curriculum, serve as mentors
and offer work experience. Growth of these academies was encouraged by the
School-to-Work Opportunities Act signed by President Clinton in May.
However there is a problem, according to Stern, that students in career
academies or apprenticeships are 'mainly trying to become part of the
workplace as it is', and not 'to change the way work is done'. This has led,
he says, to the evolution of a more ambitious level of business-education
partnership.
Support for Model
Workplaces
Under this model employers help educational institutions to carry out
productive activities which can serve as 'laboratories to develop techniques
for the learning organisation'. The goods or services are then put on sale
to people other than the students involved.
Such programmes are common at university and graduate level - for example
students staff teaching hospitals or produce law review journals. Stern's
research for the OECD shows that 19 per cent of US secondary schools have at
least one school-based 'enterprise'. US examples involve students in
building houses and running restaurants. Similar schemes are emerging in
Australia and Denmark.
Stern believes these enterprises provide better learning experiences for the
pupils than work experience in real companies, as there is less danger of
being left with simple repetitive tasks with low educational value. As such
enterprises need not have to make a profit, they can afford to allow
students to work slowly and carefully, learning from mistakes. In this way
they can also experiment with new production and management techniques.
One US hotel, for example, is considering using its school enterprise to
experiment with skill-based pay, while students operating a retail outlet in
a commercial shopping centre have been divided by teachers into teams with
different areas of responsibility. Each team is judged by a series of
performance measures, including profitability, service and prevention of
theft.
According to Stern, this might provide useful lessons to neighbouring
commercial retailers, who have been slow to introduce the principle of team
organisation.
As Stern's OECD report concludes: 'By supporting school-based enterprise,
employers might learn a lot.'

FT  10 OCT 94 / Management: Pioneers and prophets - Elton Mayo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian-born pioneer of industrial sociology, is credited with
instilling the 'human factor' in management theory.
The legacy of his ideas is evident in many modern management theories that
stress communications, corporate culture and leadership.
Although Mayo's most important work took place at Harvard, where he remained
until two years before his death in 1949, his work on industrial unrest drew
on an eclectic early career.
Born in 1880, his career spanned medical training in London and Edinburgh, a
partnership in an Adelaide printing company, teaching mental and moral
philosophy at Queensland University and pioneering work on the
psycho-analytic treatment of shell-shock during the first world war.
He transferred some of his ideas relating to nervous problems to industry,
arguing that: 'So long as commerce specialises in business methods which
take no account of human nature and social motives, so long may we expect
strikes and sabotage to be the ordinary accompaniment of industry'.
His best remembered work arose from the lighting experiments known as the
'Hawthorne effect', which took place at the Western Electric company's plant
at Hawthorne, Chicago. The researchers set factory lighting at different
strengths to discover what would have the greatest effect on productivity.
The light was brightened for one group and left unchanged for another. The
result was an enigma: both groups increased their production. Subsequently,
Mayo found that any change to the workers' conditions led to a rise in
output.
Mayo concluded that the employees had gained in work satisfaction by the
attention lavished on them and by the co-operation between informal groups
in the workplace. He argued that the main objective of management was to
encourage co-operation and team work among employees.
'Worker-management conflict may be due less to ostensible reasons for the
dispute such as tea-breaks or insufficient light, than emotional attitudes,'
he said. Workers were ruled by the 'logic of sentiment', while managers were
moved by the 'logic of cost and efficiency'.
However, David Collinson, a lecturer in organisational behaviour at Warwick
University, describes Mayo's ideas as a 'paradox'.
Mayo's stress on communications and good personal relationships appears to
be a more humanistic philosophy than for example, the 'scientific
management' principles espoused by Frederick Taylor. But it can be
criticised for its patronising view of an irrational workforce and its
supposition that conflict can be sorted out by improving communications
between management and workers.
Nonetheless, Collinson concedes that Mayo's work 'has a relevance today'.
The 'Hawthorne effect' remains widely cited by academics. And management
theory and consultancy projects continue to be influenced by the idea that
workers want recognition, security and a sense of belonging.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Management: Bumping into office etiquette
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By the time you read this, I will be sitting at home with my feet up
enjoying the first week of a long holiday. Normally I would refer to this
period as maternity leave, but 'holiday' is the term that a senior colleague
used the other day. It was, he now assures me, an unfortunate slip of the
tongue, which he would never have made had he not been so weighed down with
work. I accept his excuses, yet take his embarrassment as evidence that
pregnant women present a problem of office etiquette.
From next week UK law will be changed, so that employers will no longer be
able to fire pregnant women, nor refuse maternity leave if they have not
worked there for two years. Yet changing the rules may prove simpler than
teaching men how best to behave around their bulging workmates.
Initially I had planned to write an etiquette guide to help them out. But
the more I thought about it, the more I realised it was an impossible task.
Some women love to be fussed over, be made to sit down and brought cups of
tea. Others wish to have their growing girth ignored and view any remarks as
a slight on their professionalism.
You have to feel sorry for men who are trying to deal with the situation
sensitively. What ever they do they cannot win. I find myself irritated when
business contacts I scarcely know ask me whether this is my first child and
then tell me all about their own families. Equally, when I waddled into a
meeting with a stomach the size of a watermelon I was put out to have my
condition unremarked upon.
To complicate matters further, a remark that is acceptable from one man may
be out of order from another. Lord Weinstock has not only committed the sin
of interrogating me about my family, he has reprimanded me for sitting in
his office when I should have been at home with my children. Instead of
kicking him, I was amused, charmed even.
Still, there are a few rules that can be applied in most cases:
Never touch. This should go without saying, yet at least one colleague has
approached my belly hand outstretched.
Never ask anyone if they are expecting, unless they are unmistakably
pregnant. The chances are they have just put on weight.
Do not immediately ask pregnant women if they are returning to work
afterwards. This implies you have shunted them into a non-serious class.
As the bulge gets larger and larger, try not to look alarmed. It is annoying
to be told that you should be in hospital when you still have several weeks
to go.
On the subject of friction between the sexes at work: I seem to have
irritated quite a few fathers by saying last week that mothers make great
managers. To set the record straight, I meant that anyone who has put in the
hours civilising children will have learnt a few management lessons. If I
didn't pay lip service to the New Man, it was because I assume there are not
many of them about, especially not among Financial Times readers.
Even so, maybe I should have mentioned fathers. One management consultant
has written to me explaining that the modern manager is not complete unless
they play the parts of both mother (rich in instinct and feeling) and father
(strong on intellectually justifiable analysis). It is my turn to be
irritated again.
We have seen management consultants take over big business, the BBC, the
health service, schools . . . there can barely be a private or public sector
organisation left that does not use them. But still consultants are not
satisfied. Now they want to take over the reins of government. In a letter
to the FT last week, the head of Bain &amp; Co pointed out that all the main UK
political parties have the same strategy, but all are useless at
implementing it and hopeless novices when it comes to management.
So let's get rid of politicians and have management consultants instead.
Which will you vote for: Bain, McKinsey or Boston Consulting Group?
One event I will be sorry to miss on my holiday is a seminar next month on
'Quantum Leadership' which has been described as 'magnificent' by Business
Week magazine. John Wareham, the brains behind it, is a member of the wacky
school of management gurus who wears a paisley waistcoat and has his glasses
on his head. His one-day seminar promises to teach you about 'energy and
aggression, lust and libido', 'the fallacy of the okay gal/guy and why more
than 80 per cent of job candidates are mentally ill'.
I will miss him in Europe this winter but I am cheered to see his world tour
continues next year. Perhaps I shall book in at his Bermuda gig, though I'm
not sure where I'll get the Dollars 1,150 entrance fee from.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Management: Teaching service, not servility
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Across the world young people equate the service industry with 'servility',
according to American Express. The company, whose business is critically
reliant on travel and tourism, has responded with an ambitious programme of
investment in education, tightly controlled from its New York headquarters.
John Petersen, a director of Amex's European division, outlined the extent
of the problem. He said: 'Europe's population is declining and there's a
high staff turnover already in the industry as a result of its poor image.
This is creating growing shortages of skilled labour.'
Young people's perception of the industry existed, he said, partly because
education was 'ill-adapted' to the industry's needs. Thus it failed to
provide the necessary pool of skilled labour, even while unemployment was
rising.
Amex's European response is carefully modelled on an approach pioneered in
New York, where the company has created a foundation to deal with its
philanthropic activities in the US and elsewhere.
Local Amex managers play a role in implementing programmes in their areas,
according to Donald Hirsch of Warwick University, but always under the
financial control of the corporation.
In the US, Amex decided to focus on pre-vocational and vocational programmes
for secondary school pupils. They chose to do this by setting up, with the
investment bank Shearson Lehman Hutton, an 'academy of finance' in a state
high school in New York.
It offered a curriculum tied to the last two years of compulsory education,
organised thematically around careers in the financial services industry,
but also including more general programmes in subjects such as maths.
Teachers, as well as pupils, were offered opportunities to learn more about
the industry.
By 1989, the academy of finance had spread to 35 schools in 17 cities. A
smaller operation, the academy of travel and tourism, started in Miami and
New York in 1986.
In the UK, Amex's first educational involvement was modelled directly on the
US experience, with an attempt to start a travel and tourism academy, in
conjunction with several hotel companies, in the London borough of Ealing in
1986.
But it soon found it was necessary to tailor the programme to the UK's more
specialised school curriculum, where pupils study a limited number of
subjects for GCSE exams from the age of 14. Rather than operate academies,
the company developed the syllabus for the new GCSE subject of 'travel and
tourism'.
It also sponsored printed curriculum material and textbooks to help teachers
deliver the courses. Amex accepts this will not produce directly
quantifiable benefits. But with 50,000 pupils taking the GCSE exam in
England each year, it is confident its development can only help the
industry.
Amex has also adapted its programme to the needs of other markets. In
Ireland the syllabus includes history and literature - in line with the
country's approach to attracting tourists; in Hungary the programme
accentuates skills which had not been fostered by the communist regime, such
as entrepreneurship and building personal and social skills for dealing with
customers.
According to Hirsch, Amex's centralised approach to the programmes 'does not
create dirigisme so much as a broadly common set of standards for
controlling spending, and a set of local managers who identify with the
central ethos'.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Councils braced for hard talks on finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local authorities today meet Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary,
saying they are braced for the 'toughest finance settlement they have ever
faced'.
They say councils had to draw on reserves to meet last year's
government-imposed pay rise of 2.9 per cent for their staff, and that extra
responsibilities placed on them over the last year will cost Pounds 1.6bn to
implement.
The squeeze on local authority budgets is worsened by a fall in the revenue
generated by national non-domestic rates, paid by businesses.
When these rates were introduced in 1990-91, they raised Pounds 10.4bn,
which rose to Pounds 12.4bn the following year. But they have fallen every
year since then, and are Pounds 10.7bn, for 1994-95 - a fall mainly due to
initial overvaluations and to properties being left empty during the
recession.
Local authorities believe this shortfall could affect the funds available
for this year.
The associations of county councils, district councils and metropolitan
authorities, all of which are Labour-led, said that an extra Pounds 1.6bn,
excluding inflation, was needed to meet several increased service
requirements, including:
Pounds 400m arising from legislation including the Children Act, the
Criminal Justice Act and the Police and Magistrates Court Act.
Pounds 600m for demand-led changes, including rising numbers of school
pupils and elderly, infrastructure costs, and social and structural changes,
including an extra Pounds 150m in mandatory rent allowances.
Pounds 300m to respond to other government-led initiatives such as improved
safety standards for school transport, limits on class sizes, and training
for social services staff.
Pounds 200m for care in the community.
Mr Gummer must decide how to buffer the impact of the change in the formula
for allocating grants to local government, which was introduced this year.
This sharply reduced grants to 18 central London authorities.
Last year authorities which lost funds received 'damping' grants from the
govern-ment to limit council tax rises.
The Labour-controlled Association of London Authorities said council tax
bills would rise by an average 25 per cent in those boroughs if all these
grants were removed next year.
A survey by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, suggested that this would
mean an extra Pounds 133 a year for a typical household.
This could be avoided by slashing Pounds 180m from authority budgets.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand recommended that the damping grant should be withdrawn
progressively over three to four years.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Howe presses Major to ignore Eurosceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major, the prime minister, was warned bluntly last night by Lord
Howe, the former foreign secretary, to ignore pressure from Conservative
sceptics to exclude Britain from the next stage of European integration.
On the eve of the Tory party conference and of publication of his own
political memoirs, Lord Howe voiced his dismay at the 'strong, sustained and
growing background of hostility' to Mr Major's pledge when he first entered
Downing Street that he would keep Britain at the heart of Europe.
He spoke as leading members of the Tory right - including Lord Tebbit and Mr
Norman Lamont - prepared to demand at the Bournemouth conference assurances
that Mr Major will reject further encroachment on British sovereignty.
Mr Lamont, former chancellor, is expected to insist in an appearance on the
conference fringe that Mr Major pledges that Britain will take no part in a
single European currency.
But Lord Howe, whose resignation over European policy precipitated Lady
Thatcher's downfall in 1990, said the case for Britain retaining a central
role in shaping Europe's future had become stronger.
Voicing in public the views of pro-European ministers such as Mr Kenneth
Clarke, Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr David Hunt, he told the magazine of the
Tory Reform Group: 'The case for ensuring that Europe is not dominated by a
Continental partnership from which Britain is excluded is proving itself
stronger and stronger with every day that passes.'
In a sideswipe at Mr Major's suggestion that the creation of a multi-speed
Europe would allow Britain to opt out of more areas of integration, Lord
Howe said: 'If we are a member of a European club in which we find
ourselves, by our own choice, more unequal than others in most areas, then
there is a danger of creating the two-speed, second-division future for
Europe which we claim we don't want.'
Britain could be slower-moving in areas such as social policy and monetary
union but 'the central thrust of our policy has to be devoted to
participation in the European Union'.
In spite of confidence in the Tory hierarchy that this week it can avoid the
bitter fights over Europe which dogged the last two annual conferences, it
was clear last night that both sides were determined to stake out their
ground.
Mr Hunt, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, intends to use a speech
on the fringe to stress that Britain cannot withdraw from 'the heart of
Europe'.
But Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, spoke for the Eurosceptic side of
the cabinet table when he insisted yesterday that there was no question of
Britain participating in a single currency for 'the foreseeable future'.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Party is warned of decline in numbers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tory party faces the threat of a drastic decline in its grassroots
membership unless it takes action now to attract new and younger members,
says an independent study published today.
Detailed research by three university lecturers has revealed that only 5 per
cent of the party's estimated 750,000 members are below the age of 35. The
average age of members is 62 and almost a half of the members are aged 66 or
over.
The study warns that without a shift in that balance the party could lose 40
per cent of its membership in the next decade.
The authors, Mr Patrick Seyd from Sheffield University, Mr Paul Whiteley
from William and Mary College in the US and Mr Jeremy Richardson from
Warwick University, base their analysis on interviews with nearly 2,500
activists.
The research shows that typical party members are retired, come from
middle-class occupational backgrounds and are owner-occupiers. The
membership is composed fairly equally of men and women.
It confirms that big majorities of the party faithful favour hanging,
encouragement for immigrants to return home and tougher laws to discourage
divorce.

The most expensive town to live in in the UK is Woking in Surrey and the
cheapest is Thurso in Caithness, says a cost-of-living report published
today.
The Reward Group survey says Greater London is the most expensive area in
terms of the income required to live there. Woking is followed in the
high-cost league by Welwyn Garden City, Berkhamsted and Hemel Hempstead, all
in Hertfordshire.
The cheapest after Thurso are Merthyr Tydfil, Mid Glamorgan; Northern
Ireland; Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, and Barnsley, South York-shire.
Reward says the most expensive goods and services are in Lerwick, Shetland,
and the cheapest are in Morecambe, Lancs.
In quality of life, Scotland comes out streets ahead of any other part of
the UK. The survey calculates its quality of life index by subtracting
cost-of-living figures from average salaries in the various regions.
The West Midlands has the lowest of quality-of-life rating in the index.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Britain yesterday pledged substantial aid to the Palestine Liberation
Organisation in building an autonomous civil administration in Gaza.
Mr David Hunt, minister for science and Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster, told Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, that Britain was also
ready to offer money and expertise in promoting international investment in
Gaza, helping with scientific and technical research and establishing a
Palestinian Standards Institute.
Mr Hunt, the first cabinet minister to meet Mr Arafat since his return to
Gaza, held two hours of talks with the PLO chairman after a week-long visit
to Israel and the formerly occupied territories.
He said afterwards that the British aid package would be worth Pounds 75m
over three years. About Pounds 3m was spent last week in an emergency
operation to guarantee the salaries of the Palestinian police force, but the
main purpose is to help the PLO to build a civil administrative structure
from scratch.
Palestinians will be trained in the UK and British experts will be sent to
Gaza. Mr Hunt will now report to the international contact group
co-ordinating aid for the PLO on other areas in which Mr Arafat is seeking
assistance.

FT  10 OCT 94 / NHS trusts will be told to reveal costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, will next week tell National
Health Service trusts to give more information about the amount they spend
on management.
Amid growing concern that trust hospitals and community health groups spend
too much on bureaucracy, she will tell trust chief executives to give full
details of management costs in their annual accounts with effect from April
next year.
At the Conservative party conference this week she will announce that the
government may issue league tables of management spending by trusts in order
to expose those that spend too much.
A senior Department of Health official said last week: 'The government is
determined to pile the pressure on the trusts.
'The message will be that there is no hiding place for bureaucracy, and that
you have to be open and accountable about what you spend.'
The assault on management costs follows a strong attack on bureaucracy in
the health service by Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, at his party's
Blackpool conference last week. Mr Blair said that the NHS reforms had
benefited 'not the patient but the penpusher'.
Concern about the issue has also been felt in the government. There are
indications that the number of NHS managers rose by nearly 25 per cent in
1992.
Mrs Bottomley will remind Tory delegates this week that she is committed to
reducing NHS bureaucracy by axing the regional health authorities in England
and paving the way for mergers of district health authorities and family
health service authorities.
But in recent months health department officials have completed the initial
groundwork for introducing league tables of management spending by trust
hospitals.
In July a confidential report into spending by trusts was completed by
Whitehall officials, the Trust Federation and the Audit Commision, the
government spending watchdog. The report defines what an NHS manager is. The
government is concerned that Labour MPs, unions and other critics have used
a definition that includes medical practitioners.
The report found that NHS trusts spent an average of about 6.5 per cent of
their budgets on management, a figure the health department could use as a
guide to how much should be spent in future.
Health department officials made clear last week that the government does
not have statutory powers to set a limit on management spending or to force
trusts to account for it. But they were confident that Mrs Bottomley's call
for management costs to be made explicit in annual accounts would be heeded.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Tories face debates on sell-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Privatisation and tax are likely to dominate the Tory party conference this
week with an announcement that Railtrack is still on course to be sold in
spite of the three-month signalling dispute.
A powerful group of cabinet ministers is continuing to press for partial
privatisation of the Post Office, although Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, yesterday said the government had yet to make a
decision.
The DTI is said to be encouraged by the consultation process which ended
last month. Mr Heseltine said he had not changed his mind about the
conclusions of his green paper, which advocated a 51 per cent sale of the
Royal Mail.
While the cabinet is still expected to back the controversial sale Whitehall
officials privately concede that those who want to keep the Post Office in
the public sector have gained ground in recent weeks.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, will warn against privatisation for the
sake of it when he addresses a Tory Reform Group fringe meeting. He is said
to remain in favour of partial privatisation of the Post Office, although he
is less enthusiastic about the sale than Mr Heseltine or Mr John Redwood,
Welsh secretary.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, will announce tomorrow that the
government intends to press on with privatisation of Railtrack, the
signalling and track company.
He believes the outcome of the signalling dispute, which led to the
introduction of new working practices, makes the sale more likely. However,
many in the City question whether the company can be privatised without two
years of accounts.
The issue of tax cuts will be raised by the rightwing Conservative Way
Forward group, which yesterday called for 2p off the 25p basic rate of tax
in next month's Budget.
Ministers on both the right and left of the party yesterday indicated that
the government might have to go into the next election without tax cuts.
Mr Redwood, who is to address the Conservative Way Forward group this week,
said the time to resume 'our normal course' of cutting taxes might not be
until the middle to late nineties.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Ford wooed over new Jaguar car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has offered a financial aid package worth tens of millions of
pounds to Ford, the US carmaker, in an effort to persuade it to build a new
range of Jaguar cars in the UK rather than the US.
The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday: 'We have made an offer
and we are discussing the details.'
Ford, which took over the UK carmaker for Pounds 1.6bn at the end of 1989,
has for the past couple of years been preparing a project to build a range
of smaller Jaguar sports saloons. A formal decision is not expected until
next year.
The car, code-named X200, would be an addition to the Jaguar range and would
more than double output to more than 100,000 a year by 1998-99. The car is
planned for launch in 1998.
The government was forced earlier this year to provide about Pounds 9.5m in
selective regional aid to persuade Ford to build another car, the successor
to the Jaguar XJS, at Jaguar's Coventry plants, rather than at a Ford plant
in Portugal. That car, codenamed X100, will go into production in the summer
of 1996.
Mr Alex Trotman, Ford chairman and chief executive, said last week that the
Pounds 9.5m 'would pale by comparison' with the aid needed to ensure that
the X200 is built in the UK.
The range is being developed as a derivative of DEW98, one of Ford's global
car projects, which is expected to lead to a new range of executive/luxury
cars to be produced in north America, most probably for sale under the
Lincoln and Mercury brand names. They would compete with luxury cars from
BMW and Mercedes-Benz of Germany and makes such as Toyota's Lexus.
The new Jaguar would share the same 'chassis platform' and other components
as the other DEW98 cars, but would have a unique body shell and would
probably use a new range of Jaguar V8 engines under development that are to
be built at Ford's engine plant at Bridgend, south Wales.
Mr Trotman said one of Ford's US plants 'could build Jaguars just fine. We
have some of the best-quality factories in the world in the US.'
The government faces a difficult task to justify the level of financial aid
being sought by Ford in the number of new jobs that will be created at
Jaguar. Some government officials are understood to be sceptical about the
expense of backing the project.
International carmakers have become aware that substantial state aid can be
gained in Europe from governments eager to maintain car production capacity
or to attract new projects.
Volkswagen of Germany has recently won promises of state aid from Spanish
central and regional governments amounting to several hundred million pounds
for the development of future products at Seat, its troubled Spanish
subsidiary.
In the UK the government has recently provided modest selective regional
assistance to Peugeot, the French carmaker, which has added a saloon version
of its 306 range to production at its Ryton, Coventry plant.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Rise in interest rates hits public optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month's rise in interest rates sharply reversed a rise in public
optimism about employment prospects and the economy, says the latest FT/MFS
Mood of the Nation index.
The index has fallen from 91 in early August to 83 at the end of September,
the lowest figure since the spring. Professor Robert Worcester, chairman of
MORI Financial Services, the index compiler, said: 'What is worse for the
government, the beneficiaries of the interest rate rise do not register any
increase in approval, while those who are hit by it register strong
disapproval.'
The 24 per cent of householders who own their homes outright, and who are
more likely to be net savers, registered an index figure for their mood of
125, the same as in August.
Mortgage holders, who make up 44 per cent of householders, registered a
decline from 86 to 80, and council tenants, who make up 22 per cent of
householders, from 80 to 71.
The mood - judged by three questions on well-being and employment security -
started at 100 in April 1993. It fell sharply until March, since when it
recovered to a peak of 91 at the beginning of August.
The most recent fall in optimism is much stronger among women than men and
is much stronger in the 25 to 34 age group than among the old.
Like other surveys, the Mood of the Nation index suggests that fear of
redundancy remains high in spite of the fall in registered unemployment. The
unemployment index remained at 7 per cent, as it has in the past 12 months.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Police and protesters clash in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporter
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 20 people were arrested and about 25 others were taken to hospital
with minor injuries last night after hundreds of demonstrators clashed with
police at the end of a march through London against the criminal justice
bill.
Fires were lit in Park Lane as 2,000 police battled with members of a crowd
estimated by police to number 20,000. Pieces of masonry and other objects
were hurled at police and gas was sprayed at them. A loudspeaker warning was
issued from a helicopter circling overhead: 'Disperse now or force will be
used.'
Protesters hemmed in by railings taunted police - many of whom had riot
shields - while others in the crowd spread into Hyde Park. Police moving in
waves then swept them across the park towards Marble Arch after fires had
been lit in the road nearby.
Park Lane was barred to traffic and Marble Arch Underground station was
closed as mounted police chased part of the crowd along Oxford Street, where
shop windows were smashed.
The clashes came after the rally had been addressed by Mr Arthur Scargill,
president of the National Union of Mineworkers, and Mr Tony Benn, the former
Labour cabinet minister who is now MP for Chesterfield.
Mr Benn said: 'This bill is designed to prevent people from leading full and
happy lives and from enjoying themselves.' He regretted that the Labour
leadership had not joined the rally to protest at the bill, which curbs
defendants' right of silence and increases police powers to disperse
suspected gatherings of 'New Age travellers' and squatters.
Mr Jeremy Corbyn, Labour MP for Islington North, who chaired the rally,
said: 'The police deliberately charged demonstrators when they knew that
everyone was leaving, and a number of people were seriously hurt, including
young children. The police officer in charge needs to be disciplined for his
actions.'
Chief Supt Richard Cullen, who was in charge of the police operation, blamed
'anarchists' for the violence which he said was 'fully orchestrated'. He
said: 'A hard core of 600 or 700 people have spoiled a legitimate protest.
They had CS gas and bricks, and these are not things they found on the
route.' The police had not lost control, but had endured some 'very
unpleasant' clashes.
He added: 'There was no need for this. There are many people who came up to
me and apologised for this . . . the majority of people came here peacefully
and the stewards worked really hard.'
Asked why police were not able to cordon off the trouble-makers, he said:
'What can we do about these people? We are not allowed to infiltrate these
groups. You never know where they are going to come from.'

FT  10 OCT 94 / Financial sector growth falters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A picture of faltering recovery emerges from a survey of the financial
services sector released today by the Confederation of British Industry.
The quarterly CBI and Coopers &amp; Lybrand financial services survey finds
business activity in the sector flattened in the third quarter in spite of
expectations of a marked rise in the previous quarter.
Expectations in the sector are the least positive since March last year,
although growth is expected to resume in the next three months after
sustained growth in the first half of the year.
Mr Sudhir Junankar, associate director for economic analysis at the CBI,
said: 'The pause in activity may well be only temporary, particularly if
expectations of moderate growth in the months ahead are fully met.'
The results show a mixed picture in the industry. Banks, fund managers and
finance houses reported the strongest increase in business in the last
quarter while life insurers and building societies reported the sharpest
falls.
Mr Alan Wooley, head of financial services marketing at Coopers &amp; Lybrand,
said confidence remained lowest among building societies because of the lack
of recovery in the housing market.
Overall, profitability rose for the 11th consecutive quarter and at the
fastest rate since the end of last year because of falls in costs combined
with rises in income. Employment rose slightly following the trend set in
the last quarter after almost four years.
The CBI concluded that demand would continue to be the main constraint on
business prospects in the year ahead. Export orders for manufacturers in the
West Midlands have continued to rise, but domestic demand is flat, says a
survey by the chambers of commerce in the region.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Industry may be forced to fund recycling of packaging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer goods manufacturers and big retailers could face a levy to fund the
recovery and recycling of waste packaging, as the government considers
introducing legislation on the issue in the next session of parliament.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, has decided after consulting with
packaging companies, retailers and manufacturers that plans for a voluntary
system to recover value from about 58 per cent of domestic packaging waste
by the year 2000 need to be underpinned by legislation.
It is thought that plans for legislation may be included in the Queen's
Speech next month, but this is likely to depend on whether other bills, such
as Post Office privatisation, go ahead.
Mr Gummer has indicated that he favours making one section of the packaging
chain - so-called brand owners, or consumer goods manufacturers and
retailers selling own-label goods - responsible for en-suring recovery
targets are met.
In July last year the environment secretary called on industry and retailers
to devise a voluntary system to increase the volume of packaging waste
recovered to between 50 per cent and 75 per cent, in line with EU targets.
In response, 28 companies formed the Producer Responsibility Group, which in
February unveiled plans for an industry organisation, called Valpak, to
recover 58 per cent of packaging waste annually by 2000.
The group appointed Sir Sydney Lipworth, former chairman of the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission, to investigate ways of meeting the estimated Pounds
100m cost of the scheme. In July Sir Sidney proposed a complex levy paid by
packaging manufacturers and users, but passed on to consumers - who would
pay about 1p for every Pounds 10 of purchases.
Packaging companies have been lobbying Mr Gummer against the scheme,
claiming the bulk of the costs would ultimately be passed back to them,
seriously damaging profitability.
At the same time the group's members warned the environment secretary that
they felt legislation was needed to ensure that the system worked properly.
At a meeting with the group on September 28 Mr Gummer and Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, accepted the need for legislation,
but felt that the Lipworth levy was too complex to enforce.
The Department of the Environment favours a simpler approach, targeting
brand owners, which are seen as having the greatest influence on packaging
used for their products. Brand owners would have to pay for their own
recovery schemes or contribute to funding Valpak.
The Producer Responsibility Group has appointed Mr Christopher
Stewart-Smith, outgoing president of the British Chambers of Commerce, as
chairman, to devise a structure for Valpak. It is due to present a report at
the end of this month, and then disband, to be replaced by a wider body.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Sainsbury joins supermarket price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J. Sainsbury is joining the autumn price skirmishing with rival supermarket
groups with a series of bold, 10-second TV advertisements offering a third
or more off the price of selected products.
The UK's biggest food retailer said the brash campaign - a departure from
its celebrity recipe advertisements - was designed to improve perceptions of
its pricing, alongside its reputation for quality.
The campaign started yesterday as Iceland, the frozen food retailer,
launched an 'Everyday super value range' of basic frozen goods which it said
were being sold at almost 20 per cent below their 1984 prices.
Sainsbury's new advertisements, more reminiscent of a discount chain but
carrying its long-standing slogan 'Sainsbury's - where good food costs
less', will run in tandem with its recipe advertisements, producing what Mr
Ivor Hunt, marketing director, called a 'double whammy'.
Mr Hunt said that in addition to its strong brand name Sainsbury's weekly
price check on 750 product lines consistently showed it had a 2 per cent or
3 per cent price advantage over competitors.
He said: 'We want to strengthen our price perception. We don't get the
credit for these low prices.' He added that the group was using 'short,
dramatic and to-the-point' advertisements to 'illustrate prices in a
stronger way'.
Mr Hunt denied that the advertisements might be seen as downmarket or risk
harming the Sainsbury's brand.
The advertisements will be backed by a programme of other temporary price
cuts. Mr Hunt expected reduced gross margins to be 'more than offset' by
increased sales.
Sainsbury is also continuing its 'Essentials' campaign, launched a year ago,
offering indefinite reductions an about 300 products.
Autumn promotions are an established feature of food retailing, but the
aggressiveness of this year's campaigns reflects the highly competitive
environment, with superstore groups squeezed by slow spending growth, a
low-inflation environment, competition from cut-price chains, and increasing
market saturation.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Exports boost for West Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Export orders for manufac-turers in the West Midlands have continued to
rise, but domestic demand is flat, says a survey by the chambers of commerce
in the region.
The survey of 640 manufacturing and service companies, published today,
shows a steady rise in the past year in manufacturers reporting big export
order books - from 30 per cent to 37 per cent.
But last month the proportion of manufacturers reporting increased home
orders was 41 per cent, scarcely changed in any of the quarterly surveys
since September 1993.
Service companies have been facing slacker markets - 45 per cent of
companies have bigger domestic order books, down from 57 per cent six months
ago, while 19 per cent reported a higher level of export orders, compared
with 40 per cent six months ago.
This is a reversal of the trend in the first half, when it appeared that the
service sector was leading the traditional manufacturing heartland of the UK
out of recession.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Economy likely to slow next year, says Item Club
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK economy will slow next year with base rates unlikely to rise above 7
per cent, says an independent economic forecaster using the Treasury's model
of the economy.
The Ernst &amp; Young Item Club says in its forecast for the economy released
today that the central scenario is for UK economic growth to slow to 2.75
per cent next year from more than 3.5 per cent this year.
The forecast follows other recent signs of weakness in the economy including
a 0.3 per cent fall in manufacturing output in August.
Further signs of a slowing economy come today from consumer credit figures
for August, released by the Finance and Leasing Association. The association
says consumer credit in August rose 29 per cent on an annual basis to Pounds
1.89bn, a slower increase than in recent months.
The association said that fear of higher interest rates, based on experience
of rates rising to 15 per cent, was depressing consumer spending.
Mr Paul Droop, chief economist at the Item Club, said consumer spending in
1995 would be restrained by the impact of higher interest rates on the
housing market, lack of jobs growth, and tax increases.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Companies found to be worse off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manufacturing companies appear to be in a worse position, with lower wage
productivity and profits and higher borrowings, than they were before the
volatile business environment of the late 1980s, according to a report on
medium-sized businesses in the Yorkshire area, Humberside and the north of
England.
Because profits in the late 1980s were used to reduce long-term debts,
increase wages and invest, subsequent decline in demand has left survivors
in many sectors with excess capacity and, in spite of considerable
redundancies, a less efficient workforce, it says.
The manufacturing sector has also suffered from increased competition from
abroad and the emergence of cheaper imported goods. Many companies face a
difficult path back to the high levels of profit, investment and employment
enjoyed during the 1980s.
It says medium-sized companies are an important vehicle for future economic
growth, particularly in the Yorkshire area and Humberside. But essential
pre-requisites to their success include wide-ranging skills, a global
outlook, constant investment in the development of people and the harnessing
of new technologies.
'Medium-sized businesses are substantial enough and flexible enough to meet
this challenge, but have a poor economic foundation to build on,' says the
report. It concludes that a 'developmental' stance needs be taken by
investors, government economic policy and the businesses themselves to
realise potential.

The upturn in the European economy means British exporters' customers are

An NCM survey shows that the value of payment delays fell 24 per cent in the

of June.
The value of payment delays by German companies had risen in the last

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Any further rise in interest rates would 'risk stalling the housing market
completely', according to a survey of more than 600 building companies
published today.
The survey by the Building Employers Confederation said the industry was
making a slow but patchy recovery. Consumer confidence was very fragile,
however, particularly in the housing market where sales in September had not
seen the normal seasonal uplift.
About 52 per cent of builders expected total construction output to rise in
the next 12 months, however, compared with 37 per cent which expected output
to remain the same and 11 per cent which expected output to fall.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Employee survey results kept secret
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies which use workforce surveys to obtain information from their
employees are often reluctant to share all their findings with their staff,
a report says today.
The increasing popularity of surveys was reflected in the high degree of
satisfaction with results reported among the Industrial Society study of 264
organisations which have carried out recent surveys. Three-quarters of those
questioned said they would repeat the employee survey in the next two years.
The society said employee communications, health and safety, and training
were the topics most frequently investigated in the surveys, which cost
Pounds 10,000 each on average. In most cases, it said, managers would
produce post-survey action plans, although only half of the managers
canvassed thought their plans were proving successful.
The average response rate among employees was 66 per cent, said the report.
The study coincides with a critical report on employee surveys by
International Survey Research, a surveying organisation. The report said
some employers were using surveys wrongly - introducing them when they were
unnecessary, surveying too frequently, spreading them too wide and using
poor survey instruments.

<TEXT>
Temporary jobs are pre-dominant among new employment as the UK emerges from
recession, says Reed Personnel Services, Richard Donkin writes.
A report published today by Reed, one of the biggest UK employment agencies,
shows demand for temporary staff at its 200 branches at its highest since
1989. Demand for permanent staff is slightly above half the level of 1990.
Reed suggested that the growth in the use of temporary staff could reflect a
structural change in the composition of the UK workforce or the slow rate of
upturn leading employers to postpone decisions on the conversion of
temporary posts to full-time jobs.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Produce groups hit at import damage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Food is travelling further than ever before to reach an increasingly
sophisticated marketplace.
But the distances travelled are causing significant environmental, economic
and social damage, according to a report published today by the Safe
Alliance, a coalition of groups promoting sustainable agriculture.
The alliance's findings show that in the UK the same amount of food is being
transported as in 1978, but it is travelling 50 per cent further. In the
same period more than a third of the increase in demand for freight has been
caused by the transport of food, drink and tobacco, which accounts for only
8.5 per cent of gross domestic product.
British demand for air-freighted food from overseas is also on the increase.
Imports rose 15 per cent in the first half of the year compared with the
same period last year.
Mr Hugh Raven, co-ordinator of the Safe Alliance, said: 'The real costs of
food miles madness are seldom reflected in the price of food.' He pointed to
the costs of diverting land in food-deficit countries from producing for
local consumption as well as air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions from
air and road transport.
The report says it found produce in three central London supermarkets in
early September which had been flown thousands of miles in spite of
home-grown alternatives being available - apples flown 4,700 miles from the
US, onions transported 12,000 miles from Australia and green beans from
Kenya.
Mr Raven said: 'It's madness to fly food half way round the world when UK
growers are going out of business.' The alliance is urging consumers to buy
local produce and establish a hierarchy of priorities: first local, then
national, then regional produce - from the European Union.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Banks 'ease lending criteria to win business'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks are slackening their lending criteria, reducing margins and attempting
'imprudent' rates of lending growth in response to UK companies seeking
finance from other sources, says the latest annual survey from the
Association of Corporate Treasurers and the Bank Relationship Consultancy.
It says the fall in margins on syndicated loans to the biggest companies in
the past year - a trend which is increasingly worrying bankers - is also
occurring in private loans to large and medium-sized companies.
The survey of 139 banks and 233 companies finds that companies are seeking
alternative funding as business confidence grows.
Banks are allowing looser loan criteria in an effort to persuade companies
to borrow from them.
It also finds that banks are increasingly willing to lend for up to 10
years, rather than restricting loans to two or three years, as in the past.
More banks want to lend in larger amounts of between Pounds 20m and Pounds
50m.
Companies say they are willing to pay slightly higher margins on loans in
order to reduce the number of criteria. They are also willing to pay more to
ensure that banks do not have the right to sell their loan to others.
The survey says that although companies want to increase borrowing from
banks, they intend to seek more funding from other sources such as private
placement of debt in the US, leasing, and issuing sterling bonds.
It says these trends are no longer confined to the largest companies with
high credit ratings. In response, banks are becoming more willing to lend to
unquoted companies and those with lower ratings.
Mr Alastair Winter of the Bank Relationship Consultancy said commercial-bank
lending was being restricted by the growing ability of investment banks to
bridge the gap between investors and companies.
The survey says 70 per cent of banks plan substantial lending growth, with
three-quarters of those seeking growth of more than 5 per cent. It is often
thought risky for banks to expand their loans faster than the company is
growing.
Although banks say that they have to gain other forms of business from big
companies to make up for low returns on lending, the survey found that few
banks have minimum requirements for returns from borrowers.
Banks have also made only limited efforts to build up strong relationships
with companies. More than 60 per cent of them allocated 10 or more accounts
to each lending manager, and changed managers more frequently than every
three years.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Superquarry caught in centre of debate: James Buxton
examines the fierce row over the proposed destruction of a Hebridean
hillside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The eastern side of the island of Harris in the Outer Hebrides is a broken
landscape of low rocky hills, tiny lochs and jagged indentations from the
sea.
Few people live here, because apart from a little fishing and sheep farming
there is almost nothing for them to do.
One of the hills, near Lingerabay, consists of a rock called anorthosite, in
strong demand for use as aggregate in construction and road building.
Tomorrow a public inquiry starts into a controversial plan by Redland
Aggregates, part of the Redland construction group, to establish a quarry at
Lingerabay and extract 600m tonnes of anorthosite in the next 60 to 100
years.
The scale of the project justifies the term superquarry. The eastern side of
a hill named Roineabhal will gradually be scooped out and shipped away.
Eventually the hillside will give way to a man-made sea loch. The quarry
will cover an area of more than 1 sq m.
The superquarry has the support of Western Isles council which is 'minded'
to give planning consent to Redland. But Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish
secretary, has ordered a public inquiry because of the environmental and
economic issues that the project raises. The hearing is set to go on into
next year.
Redland says Lingerabay is the best of more than 40 sites in Scotland for
mining a badly needed commodity when there is a shortage of feasible
quarrying sites in England and Wales. It says the quarry, which will
initially employ 25 people, rising to between 50 and 100 at full production,
will give 'confidence and hope to a visibly declining society in south
Harris'.
The issue of the superquarry, over which the 5,000 people of Harris are
divided evenly, boils down to whether mineral extraction is the kind of
activity which will arrest the decline in the population, or whether its
environmental effects will cause further damage to a fragile economy.
The most authoritative objector is Scottish Natural Heritage, the
government's conservation agency, whose opposition made the public inquiry
inevitable. It says the quarry, in an officially designated national scenic
area, would have an unacceptable impact on its 'scenic qualities and
character'.
It would create a scar on the landscape visible from Skye, 20 miles away -
though it would be shielded from the rest of Harris - and would inflict
noise, dust, vibration from blasting, traffic and waste disposal, so
damaging the interests of those dependent on Harris's reputation as 'a
pristine tourist destination'. Aggregate could be better obtained from other
sites in Scotland, or from superquarries in Norway.
This attitude infuriates some residents, who point to the decline in the
population and the desperate shortage of economic activity in Harris. At a
recent public debate Mr Kenneth Mattheson, a crofter, complained that the
agency was giving wildlife and plants priority over people.
A local doctor said that last year in the northern part of the island only
eight babies were born but 50 people died. The population, he said, was set
to halve in the next 25 years.
But Mr Ian Callaghan, a merchant banker who moved to Harris nearly five
years ago to run a small hotel, believes the scale of the project is too big
for the island to absorb. 'The things we have here - like community values,
lack of crime, peace and quiet - are beyond price,' he said.
Redland last week agreed to pay Pounds 15,000 a year or 1p per tonne of rock
removed, whichever was the greater, into a community trust fund for local
people once production started, probably at the turn of the century. At the
5m tonnes a year which Redland hopes to achieve by 2005, that would amount
to Pounds 50,000 a year.
The company is anxious to convince islanders that it will suppress dust
emission from the site by spraying water and will ensure that ballast water
pumped out of bulk carriers before they load from the quarry does not damage
the rich prawn grounds off south-east Harris.
Yet some people doubt whether the quarry, if it goes ahead, would directly
benefit the indigenous population. The numbers it would employ would not be
high, and in spite of Redland's commitment to hiring the majority of its
workforce from the locals, it could be in for a disappointment.
One Harris man who has employed people on the island for 18 years said: 'You
can't rely on the Harris crofters as a workforce. They sign on for a job but
then take a week off to dip their sheep or dig peat. They don't want jobs,
they've got their sheep and their dole and their whisky. There's a few good
workers and their employers will want to hang on to them.'
Redland, he concluded, would have to bring in its own labour force. That
might benefit the island's economy only indirectly.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Venezuela lenders look for action not words: The
government's reluctance to administer a dose of economic medicine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela's economic policymakers see themselves as a badly misunderstood
group. They believe their country's deep social tensions mean they must
avoid the abrupt imposition of market medicine on their ailing economy lest
it spills over into popular unrest.
This justifies, they say, the return towards state control of the economy
engineered by the administration of President Rafael Caldera in the face of
a banking crisis and a subsequent run on the currency this year.
'None of us likes the controls. But there was a need for them at one
moment,' says Mr Carlos Bernardez, who is in charge of the government's
privatisation efforts.
The controls on prices and foreign exchange transactions have been necessary
in part, the government says, to retain popular support for the government
as it tackles the economic crisis. 'We have learned that we have to have an
equilibrium between the economic and political aspects of our programme, to
preserve a climate of social peace,' argues Mr Luis Raul Matos Azocar an
adviser to Mr Caldera and head of the new foreign exchange control board.
Even though the government has repeatedly said the controls will be phased
out over the next year or so, it continues to be criticised. On the day
members of the economic team appeared in London to talk about their economic
strategy, the New York brokerage house Bear Stearns sent out to clients a
critical research note arguing that foreign investors could no longer use
the Venezuelan stock exchange because of the practical problems they faced
in getting foreign exchange out of the country. While now theoretically
possible after a three-month delay, it remained practically impossible to
repatriate currency.
'The procedural blockade posed by the repatriation requirement is a
disaster,' says analyst Ms Julie Dykstra. She is also critical of a package
of measures recently put before Congress that included 'the normalisation of
intrusive executive powers.'
The government argues that foreign exchange shortages are slowly being
covered, and that the delays in obtaining foreign exchange are
'administrative problems' which are being sorted out.
Nonetheless, the senior officials in London have admitted that some of their
economic measures have put obstacles in the way of other objectives.
Privatisation is an example. The government hopes to raise as much as
Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.8bn) by the end of next year in privatisations,
starting with the 2,000MW Planto Centro electricity generating plant this
year.
The biggest element in this is the flotation of the government's 49 per cent
stake in CANTV, the telephone company. Forty per cent of this was auctioned
off in 1991 for Dollars 1.88bn to an operating group led by GTE of the US.
Yet now CANTV faces a host of problems - most caused by the government -
which will tend to make it less attractive to investors.
Like other Venezuelan companies, it has been forced to seek a rescheduling
of its foreign debts, because of the lack of availability of foreign
exchange. (The government eased this last Monday by granting CANTV Dollars
19m for interest payments.) There have also been delays in government
approval of tariff increases and a tariff structure now in place is regarded
as unattractive for investors.
The officials say that when it becomes clear the controls are only
temporary, the state companies will become a more attractive proposition to
investors.
One other issue is the persistence of negative interest rates in the economy
at a time when the government is anxious to build up foreign exchange
reserves. Mr Ramon Espinasa, chief economist at the state oil company
Petroleos de Venezuela, who helped to orchestrate the latest moves in the
government's economic strategy, explained that this a consequence of excess
liquidity caused by the bank rescue. It is why inflation has proved
stubborn, since people will buy goods to store rather than save money at
negative interest rates.
The government needs now to mop up this excess liquidity - some 1,000bn
bolivars, equivalent to 13 per cent of GDP. To do this, the bank rescue
agency Fogade - which owes this amount to the central bank  - will issue up
to 400bn bolivars in bonds. It will sell assets of the banks it now owns,
probably to the tune of some 40bn bolivars this year. The rest should be
absorbed by the issue of dollar-denominated bonds inside Venezuela, which
will be guaranteed by future oil royalties. This should account for some 6
per cent of future oil revenues (assuming a Dollars 12 a barrel oil price)
or one half a per cent of GDP for seven years. By early next year, says Mr
Espinasa, positive real interest rates should return.
The government has also been criticised for delaying what is seen as a
critical decision - the raising of domestic petrol prices to close the
budget deficit. Mr Luis Giusti, president of Petroleos de Venezuela, says
the time is needed to work out a compensation programme for the 80 per cent
of the people who use public transport. They use only 20 per cent of the
petrol - some 160,000 barrels a day - while the rest is consumed by the
minority that owns cars.
The government's recent commitments, in particular those to end controls and
to accelerate privatisation, have reduced the once-yawning gap between the
Caldera administration and its market-oriented critics inside and outside
the country. But these critics - and others such as the international
lending agencies in Washington - will want to see its commitments converted
into action before passing judgment.
Furthermore, by introducing controls in the first place and then by seeking
measures allowing wide scope for future interventionism, the government may
have inadvertently put in place a longer-term deterrent to the foreign
investment it now says it wants.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Fujimori will run again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Peru's President Alberto Fujimori chose a Lima shanty town late on Saturday
to confirm that, as widely expected, he will run for a second five-year term
of office in the general elections scheduled for April 9 1995.
The deadline for registering candidacies and running mates is tomorrow.
Backed by the parliamentary majority he acquired in the new Congress
established in the wake of his constitutional coup in April 1992, Mr
Fujimori rewrote the constitution last year to permit successive
presidential terms.
Claiming that remaining in office until the year 2000 was 'the way to
continue the work my government has carried out over the past four years',
Mr Fujimori underlined his regime's successes in curbing inflation,
combating terrorism and re-establishing relations with the international
financial community. 'Peru must not stop now,' he said.
Early opinion polls give Mr Fujimori a commanding lead over his closest
rival, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former UN secretary general. The only
other individual candidate to show more than 5 per cent popular support so
far is Mr Fujimori's estranged wife, Ms Susana Higuchi.
All the established parties, meanwhile, will present presidential slates and
congressional lists of their own. A plethora of new movements has also been
emerging over the past two weeks. By close of registration there could be
almost two dozen candidates for the presidency.
This could make Mr Fujimori vulnerable in a run-off. Despite his
consistently high popular standing, he will find it hard to obtain the 50
per cent required to avoid a second round, in which most of Peru's
opposition parties are likely to throw their weight behind Mr Perez de
Cuellar.

Mr Rafael Caldera, president of Venezuela, said at the weekend that his
country was the target of a 'detestable, perverse and anti-patriotic
campaign' carried out by 'certain sectors' through the international media,
Joseph Mann reports from Caracas.
Mr Caldera who began a five-year term in February of this year, did not say
what those 'sectors' were. However, he and other officials have indicated in
the past that some supporters of former President Carlos Andres Perez, who
was forced out of office in 1993, have used the media to sully the image of
the new administration. Official references to an international 'campaign'
have surfaced several times. Earlier this year, Mr Caldera said that
Venezuelans who used the international press to attack the country were
'traitors' and 'criminals'.

Haiti's military leader Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras and army chief of
staff Brigadier General Philippe Biamby will resign today, a Haitian
military spokesman said yesterday, agencies report from Port-au-Prince.
Col Jean-Robert Gabriel, on behalf of the Haitian high command, said Lt Gen
Cedras would hand over power to second in command Brigadier General
Jean-Claude Duperval. Col Gabriel said the plan had been approved on
Saturday in Washington by Haitian officers and representatives of exiled
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide who is due to return on Saturday.
According to some reports Lt Gen Cedras and Brig Gen Biamby were set to
leave the country and provisional president Emile Jonassaint would also
resign today. Lt Gen Cedras yesterday held separate talks with Mr Jonassaint
and Lt Gen Hugh Shelton, the US military commander in Haiti.
President Aristide named Brig Gen Duperval to replace Lt Gen Cedras in
December 1993 and has given no indication he would withdraw the nomination.
Meanwhile, at least 14 people were killed when a suspected paramilitary
member drove a truck into a pro-democracy demonstration yesterday in
Miragoane, a coastal town west of Port-au-Prince, witnesses said.
Twelve people were reported to have been killed instantly and another two
were said to have died in hospital. US soldiers blocked off the street and
removed the bodies.
Demonstrators claimed the driver was a member of the Front for the
Advancement and Progress of Haiti (Fraph), the country's main paramilitary
group. It was the second incident in three days of a vehicle driving into
supporters of exiled President Aristide. On Friday, a bus drove into a
demonstration in St-Marc, killing at least four people.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Democrats win desert bill victory: Final scramble in US
Congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Democrats won one last victory in the closing hours of the congressional
session on Saturday morning when they broke a Republican-led filibuster and
passed a bill to protect 6m acres of southern Californian desert.
The bill has become a pawn in Senator Dianne Feinstein's campaign to hold on
to her Senate seat against a well-financed attack from Republican
Congressman Michael Huffington, who has poured millions of dollars from his
family oil fortune into the election.
Senator Feinstein, who sponsored the desert protection bill, fought off the
delaying tactics of Republican senators who had tried to deny her this
campaign trophy.
In the last hours before members went home to campaign for the November 8
mid-term elections, Congress also passed a budget for the Securities and
Exchange Commission which has had to shut down many of its operations since
the registration fee on which it depends for much of its income expired on
September 30.
It also agreed to a bill requiring telephone companies to install new
software that will make it easier for government law enforcement agencies to
eavesdrop on telephone and computer communications.
But other measures sought by the administration and the Democratic
leadership, such as a safe drinking water law and legislation to set up a
museum of African American history in Washington, failed to make it through
Congress before the session ended. They joined a graveyard filled with the
corpses of President Bill Clinton's efforts to pass laws on healthcare,
welfare, telecommunications, toxic waste, campaign finance and lobbying.
Also, both chambers of Congress have had to agree to return at the end of
next month for a rare post-election session to vote on legislation enacting
the trade liberalisation measures achieved by the Uruguay Round of
negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The Californian desert bill was the 28th to face a Republican filibuster in
this Congress session, an unprecedented use of delaying tactics which have
generally been deployed only on big issues such as the 1960s civil rights
legislation. Senators no longer have to talk non-stop to sustain a
filibuster and can prevent a bill from coming to a vote unless its
supporters can muster 60 of the Senate's 100 members to vote for an end to
debate.
Democratic leaders were hard at work arranging charter flights to get
senators who had already left for campaign events back to Washington in time
for Saturday's vote. Senator Joseph Lieberman, an orthodox Jew, moved into a
hotel near the Capitol so he could take part in the vote without travelling
by car on the sabbath. Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, who cast the decisive
vote, had to make a last-minute dash to the Senate floor after the door of
her garage jammed.
If the Democrats were able to savour a final victory on the Californian
desert bill, their prospects in the November 8 election, when all of the
House and 35 of the Senate seats are in contention, still look bleak.
Mr Clinton today begins a series of campaign trips with a visit to New
Jersey, where Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg faces a strong Republican
challenge, and flies tomorrow to Michigan to campaign for Congressman Bob
Carr, who is trying to hold the seat vacated by retiring Democratic Senator
Donald Riegle.

<TEXT>
Thailand's foreign minister, Mr Prasong Soonsiri, has been ousted after a
party squabble and replaced by Mr Thaksin Shinawatra, an entrepreneur.
Mr Prasong, a tough former intelligence chief, was sometimes accused of
handling delicate relations with neighbours in a devious manner, and failing
to erase the notion that Thailand supported the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.
His replacement, the founder of the Shinawatra Computer and Communications
group, is an ambitious former policeman with no previous political
experience. He started in business by selling computers to his own police
department.
The leader of the Palang Dharma (Buddhist way) party, Mr Chamlong Srimuang,
has pushed Mr Thaksin forward as part of a reshuffle of all the party's 11
cabinet seats in the ruling five-party coalition's administration.
Mr Chamlong fears his party has been overshadowed by the ruling Democrat
party in the two years since the last election. He will enter the cabinet
for the first time as a deputy prime minister, replacing former party leader
Mr Boonchu Rojanastien, and is expected to strive to bolster the party's
Bangkok power base particularly by trying to ease the capital's traffic
jams.

FT  10 OCT 94 / US push for Israeli deal with Syrians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher will today launch an intensive
effort to bridge the differences preventing an Israel-Syria peace agreement.
He is hoping to build on the improved atmosphere created by an unprecedented
interview granted by the Syrian foreign minister to Israel's state
television at the weekend.
Mr Christopher arrived in Jerusalem yesterday at the start of a week that
will see him shuttling between Jerusalem and Damascus, visiting Jordan and
Egypt and making a trip to Kuwait. He played down hopes yesterday for a
breakthrough on the Israel-Syria track but there are now clear signs of
progress. Mr Christopher has already tentatively scheduled a return to the
region at the end of this month or early in November.
The most obvious sign yet of Syria's determination to sign a peace treaty
came on Friday when Mr Farouq a-Shara, foreign minister, gave a first
full-length interview to the Israeli media, telling state television of his
country's desire for 'peace, tranquility, stability and prosperity' in the
Middle East.
'We have to change the face of the region,' he said, urging Israel to agree
quickly to a peace deal involving the return of the Golan Heights.
The interview, conducted in Washington reportedly in the presence of Mr
Dennis Ross, US peace talks co-ordinator, was notable for Mr A-Shara's
pledge that Syria would 'pave the way' for an Israel-Lebanon accord once
peace with Damascus was achieved, and for his assurance that the Israelis
'will be absolutely satisfied' with the consequences of a peace deal. This
was an apparent reference to the fully normalised, diplomatic, trade,
tourism and cultural relations Israel has been demanding as part of an
agreement.
While taking issue with Mr A-Shara's claim that Syria had never shelled
Israeli civilian targets, prime minister Yitzhak Rabin cautiously welcomed
the interview.

One Israeli was killed, and more than a dozen were injured, when two gunmen
opened fire in central Jerusalem last night, in a pedestrian area crowded
with restaurants, a Jerusalem correspondent writes. The gunmen were shot
dead by Israeli security forces. The centre of Jerusalem was closed to
traffic, as police and the army searched for explosive devices the gunmen
might have planted. Mr Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to PLO chairman Yassir Arafat,
condemned the incident, which he said was intended to harm the Israeli-PLO
peace process.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Foreign minister ousted in Thailand

<TEXT>
Thailand's foreign minister, Mr Prasong Soonsiri, has been ousted after a
party squabble and replaced by Mr Thaksin Shinawatra, a prominent
entrepreneur.
Mr Prasong, a tough former intelligence chief, was sometimes accused of
handling delicate relations with neighbours in a devious manner, and failing
to erase the notion that Thailand supported the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.
His replacement, the founder of the Shinawatra Computer and Communications
group, is an ambitious former policeman with no previous political
experience. He started in business by selling computers to his own police
department.
The leader of the Palang Dharma (Buddhist way) party, Mr Chamlong Srimuang,
has pushed Mr Thaksin forward as part of a reshuffle of all the party's 11
cabinet seats in the ruling five-party coalition's administration.
The former president of the Bangkok Bank, Mr Vichit Surawongchai, replaces
Mr Winai Sompong, as minister for transport and communications.
Mr Chamlong fears his party has been overshadowed by the ruling Democrat
party in the two years since the last election. Mr Chuan Leekpai, the prime
minister and leader of the Democrat Party, has said he will not interfere
with the PDP reshuffle list which was given to the Democrats yesterday.
In September Mr Chamlong engineered his return as overt party leader for the
first time since 1992. His religious faction which claims high moral
principles also took control of the party executive. Mr Chamlong will enter
the cabinet for the first time as a deputy prime minister, replacing former
party leader Mr Boonchu Rojanastien.
He is expected to strive hard to bolster the party's Bangkok power base
particularly by trying to ease the capital's traffic jams.
However Mr Chamlong's dictatorial management style could upset his coalition
partners, especially since they will not want to see Palang Dharma be made
the saviours of Bangkok by solving the transport crisis.
The move may, however, improve the chances of the Tanayong group's elevated
railway being completed.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Dishonoured cheque shakes economy: In Taiwan's informal
system, a small default can make big waves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's precipitous drop in Taiwan share prices demonstrates how quickly
a relatively minor missed payment could escalate into a spate of defaults in
financial markets that thrive on rumour and black market borrowing.
Taiwan authorities appear to have largely arrested the damage from TDollars
7.6bn (Pounds 184.3m) in share payments defaults which sparked a 7.8 per
cent index tumble between Wednesday and Friday - Saturday's 6.13 per cent
fall in the index was blamed on a different cause, rumours from Beijing of
Deng Xiaoping's death.
Presented with an inadequate formal banking system, the financially
sophisticated Taiwanese resort to a panopoly of informal financing
techniques ranging from relatively innocuous 'mutual savings societies' to
underground lending by financial intermediaries referred to as jinchu or
'money-lords'.
A sudden calling-in of loans by these 'money-lords' fuelled the sell-off in
the stock market. Much of their money is channelled into securities and
their large backers, including politicians and otherwise respectable
companies, became nervous and wanted quick repayment.
Taiwan remains an economy which runs on cash and post-dated cheques. The
importance of cheques in the financial system is such that the ratio of
dishonoured cheques to total cheques issued, both dollar amount and number,
is published monthly by the central bank and is watched closely as an
indicator of economic health.
Companies commonly take deposits from employees and shareholders and pay
above-market rates of interest to obtain funds to finance their day-to-day
operations. Last month, the chairman and chief financial officer of listed
Tatung, one of Taiwan's biggest electrical appliance manufacturers, were
convicted of taking USDollars 390m in illegal deposits in violation of
banking laws.
At the centre of lask week's upheaval was a securities brokerage controlled
by the Hualon Group, a textile and financial services conglomerate run by Mr
Oung Ta-ming. The brokerage, Hung Fu Securities, had failed to honor a
Dollars 200m cheque on Tuesday, prompting a rash of rumours and a string of
defaults involving 27 domestic brokerage firms.
Mr Oung is not only one of Taiwan's richest businessmen and the most
prominent player in the stock market but an influential independent
legislator in the country's parliament. He is a member of the parliamentary
finance committee and has the support of on estimated 30 lawmakers in the
161-member body.
Last week, regulators moved to restore calm amid panic share sell-offs by
promising to meet defaulted payments out of fund established with
contributions from all brokers in the wake of a similar crisis in late 1992.
The incident highlights the fragility of the financial system's regulatory
framework and its inability to cope with the underground financial markets.
Other problems are the dominant role played in the financial system by
institutions controlled by the government and the ruling Nationalist party,
and the close but difficult to define relationship among the government,
business and the underworld.
These ties have arguably been enhanced by the advent of democracy in Taiwan
over the past decade, which has prompted some politicians to offer favours
in return for contributions to their election campaigns. However, senior
financial officials are keenly aware of the issues at stake.
Mr Liang Kuo-shu, governor of the Central Bank of China, has warned: 'We
have to be very careful to prevent too much concentration of economic power
in the hands of a few groups. Actually, you can see all the same faces
controlling much of industry and finance.'
Bringing the unofficial financial markets into line will be difficult.
Office workers and blue-collar workers commonly join savings clubs known as
'hui' in Chinese to raise funds to pay for a wedding, put a downpayment on
an apartment or invest in the stock market.
Then there are the money-lords, which finance share and property speculation
requiring larger sums. There are very roughly a dozen jinchu in Taiwan
backing some twenty or thirty major market players such as Mr Oung.
The money-lords take funds from companies or wealthy individuals wanting a
higher return than banks offer. Interest rates start at 2.4 per cent per
month and borrowers delay payment at the risk of more than their material
assets.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Iraq Menaces Kuwait: Kuwait depends on US help

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Iraq has deployed some 64,000 troops, including two of the seven divisions
of its much vaunted Republican Guards, in an area 20 to 40 miles north of
the Kuwait-Iraq border, according to US administration sources. Iraq has
also moved a mechanised infantry division and some 200 former Soviet T-72
tanks into the area.
An artillery battery is also reported to be within range of Kuwait and men
from another Republican Guard division are moving south from Mosul in
northern Iraq.
According to senior US military sources, Iraq had rebuilt its army in the
last three years to some 27 divisions, numbering 350,000 men backed up by
more than 2,000 main battle tanks. US sources say the Iraqi air force was
'cut in half' in the 1990-91 Gulf war and its navy is said to be
'negligible', but Iraq's military is still a 'formidable military force
relative to its neighbours'.
It is particularly formidable when contrasted with Kuwait's military
line-up. Kuwait has called up reservists and sent some 20,000 men - thought
to be its entire army - up near its border with Iraq, and moved up 50 tanks.
A critical report last March from the national assembly said arms purchases
of over Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.1bn) since 1991 have been made more for
political reasons than for a sustainable military strategy.
The government has bought most of its weaponry from the US, and much of the
new equipment is so new that the army has yet to become familiar with it.
Kuwait is thus overwhelmingly dependent on US assistance. On Saturday the US
announced it was sending 4,000 troops to Kuwait to join other US forces in
or near the area. These include 11 US warships in the Gulf, including an
amphibious group led by the USS Tripoli with 2,000 marines. In all, the US
has some 12,500 forces in the Gulf area, backed up by some 200 fighter
aircraft, F-117 Stealth fighter bombers and Awacs reconnaissance planes
using bases in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf. Arabia also hosts the GCC
'Peninsula Shield' force, ground forces comprising 8,000 men.
Other US forces expected in the area soon include the aircraft carrier the
USS Washington, on its way from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea; a military
cargo ship sailed on Friday from Diego Garcia with more military equipment.
The US is the only country with which Kuwait has an agreement to preposition
military supplies. Warehouses at Camp Doha, west of Kuwait city, contain
enough equipment and housing to support a brigade of 5,000 troops.
In answer to a Kuwaiti request, the UK guides missile frigate HMS Cornwall
arrived in Kuwaiti waters yesterday.
Should the Iraqis try to invade Kuwait, the initial allied response would
come from sea and air power already in the area, on advancing Iraqi ground
forces. Judging from the experience of the Gulf war, the effect could be
devastating.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Iraq Menaces Kuwait: Washington takes no chances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
No-one in Washington finds it easy to believe that President Saddam Hussein
would try to repeat his 1990 invasion of Kuwait, particularly at a season
when clear skies would leave his army, bereft of air cover, at the mercy of
US and allied aircraft.
But no-one wants to take a chance on it.
Iraq's reinforcement of the troops it already has in position near its
border with Kuwait has left US officials in considerable uncertainty.
'We can't afford to assume that this is just a bluff. That's why we're
taking the actions we're taking,' Mr William Perry, the US defence
secretary, said on Saturday.
Those actions include sending 4,000 US troops to reinforce the Kuwaiti army
 -although this is clearly not a large enough contingent to repel a
full-scale assault on its own.
More important, the US has moved aircraft and cruise missiles within
striking range.
'We clearly have the capacity to go to downtown Baghdad,' said Lieutenant
General John Sheehan, operations director at the Pentagon.
US officials are anxious to ensure that Mr Saddam has not miscalculated
President Bill Clinton's willingness to emulate the firmness his
predecessor, George Bush, showed in 1990, or the degree to which the US
military involvement in Haiti might limit its willingness or ability to
respond to Iraqi aggression.
'I want to make clear one more time: it would be a grave error for Iraq to
repeat the mistakes of the past, or to misjudge either American will or
American power,' Mr Clinton said on Saturday.
Although the Iraqi troop build-up in itself does not breach the terms of the
ceasefire imposed after Operation Desert Storm drove the Iraqi army out of
Kuwait in 1991, the US is also anxious that Baghdad should not conclude that
such threatening gestures are the best way to persuade the UN Security
Council to ease its economic sanctions, notably a ban on oil sales, which
remain in place today.
'If Iraq really is trying to say in some insistent way that what they want
is relief from the UN sanctions, there is a clear way for them to achieve
that relief: simply comply with the United Nations resolutions,' Mr Clinton
said.
Some diplomats suggest that Mr Saddam has concluded that the US, the UK and
Saudi Arabia will never allow the sanctions to be lifted so long as he
remains in power, regardless of the extent to which Iraq complies with the
resolutions.
This may be true, though US officials tend to reverse the argument, and say
they doubt that Iraq will ever comply with the resolutions so long as Mr
Saddam remains in power.
Whatever the truth, Baghdad has never come remotely close to testing the
hypothesis.
Although a system to monitor Iraq's weapons programmes has been set up - Mr
Rolf Ekeus, the head of the United Nations special commission in charge of
the monitoring, is due to report to the Security Council today - Iraq still
refuses to comply with important segments of the UN resolutions.
Most notably, Baghdad still refuses to recognise Kuwaiti sovereignty or the
border between the two countries mapped out by the UN.
The US, meanwhile, does not want to overreact to what may prove to be simply
posturing, but wants to be prepared in case tension should escalate. The
forces the Pentagon has moved to the region, though well short of the
massive expeditionary force of Desert Storm, are believed to be enough to
react strongly to any provocation.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Iraq Menaces Kuwait: With gun in hand, Saddam goes back to
the brink - Leaning on Security Council seems to be Iraqi leader's main
motive - but his threat has already failed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Once again President Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, has forced the world
at gunpoint to try to guess his motives and intentions.
His apparent motive in ordering the massing of tens of thousands of troops
and supporting armour near the border with Kuwait is, as the past week's
bitter rhetoric from Baghdad suggests, to give the United Nations Security
Council an ultimatum: take immediate steps to ease the crippling oil embargo
or suffer the 'consequences'.
This threat appears already to have failed. An emergency weekend meeting of
the Council stated the 'complete unacceptability' of Iraq's threat to cease
co-operating with the UN over implementation of Gulf war ceasefire
resolutions. Instead, his actions appear only to have confirmed that the
Saddam of the Gulf war is unchanged - that he is, in the words of the
Washington Post last week, 'an unregenerated potential repeat offender', a
leader whose primary foreign policy tool is force and who is entirely
capable of the dangerous, unpredictable, apparently illogical and almost
certainly self-defeating gesture.
The limited logic of his action appears to be to suggest to the Security
Council, and in particular Britain and the US as the members most resistant
to alleviating the four-year-old oil embargo, that unless he is given
immediate hope that the sanctions will be lifted, he can and will be a
dangerous nuisance in the Gulf.
The mobilisation of US and British forces already shows he can quickly force
costly military deployments into a region which, outside Kuwait at least,
remains uneasy at the thought of a permanent US military presence.
Mr Saddam's immediate target is the Security Council discussion due this
week on the readiness of long-term monitoring systems installed to prevent
Iraq from renewing acquisition or manufacture of weapons of mass
destruction. Mr Rolf Ekeus, the UN envoy, will report that these systems are
ready and a test period can begin. And before Iraqi troops moved south,
there was strong sympathy among some Council members, notably France, China
and Russia, for giving Iraq a definite 'probationary' test period, after
which the lifting of sanctions should be discussed.
Whether such sympathy will survive Mr Saddam's belligerent troop deployment
must be highly unlikely. 'It's brinkmanship,' said one senior Arab diplomat.
'But what Saddam has not learned is that his brinkmanship usually rebounds
on him.'
Perhaps more damaging to Mr Saddam's case is that the Security Council is
unanimous in requiring that, before anything can be done to lift sanctions,
Iraq must unequivocally recognise both Kuwait's sovereignty and the
post-Gulf war UN-demarcated borders between the two countries. By
threatening this very border, Mr Saddam has suggested an instinctive refusal
to recognise it and made it hard to take credibly any eventual recognition
he might decide, or be forced, to accord. His actions only appear to
strengthen the argument of those, like the Kuwaitis themselves, who say that
sanctions could never safely be lifted while he remains in power.
Iraqi officials have made clear that they believe this to be US policy,
although Washington denies this. The US has certainly maintained the hardest
line against offering Mr Saddam any concessions in recent weeks and, before
the troop movements, were beginning to look isolated within the Security
Council. Even British officials have suggested privately that had Iraq
behaved during a six-month testing of the UN weapons monitoring systems,
they would then be forced to consider seriously easing the embargo. Iraq may
now have lost this diplomatic ground it had been winning.
But to see Mr Saddam's renewed aggression solely in terms of influencing
debate around the Security Council table may be a mistake. Like most Middle
Eastern leaders, his most basic motivation is to take whatever actions he
deems necessary to remain in power. This, for 15 years, he has done with
genocidal brutality, but with success - crushing Kurdish, Shia and any other
domestic political opposition and of course, surviving ignominious defeat in
the Gulf war and four economically ruinous years without selling oil,
previously the fount of more than 90 per cent of Iraq's earnings.
But there have been recent clear signs that the regime may be wobbling under
the accumulated effects of sanctions. Iraq is so short of food that
government rations, on which most Iraqis rely for two thirds of their basic
nutritional intake, recently had to be halved.
Rocketing inflation has driven all but Iraq's elite into penury. Army
desertion has become so rife that Mr Saddam recently ordered that deserters
should have their ears severed. Similarly brutal punishments have been
decreed for common criminals in what recent visitors to Iraq say has
becoming a dangerously lawless place. There have been recent reports of Mr
Saddam having to crush opposition within the army.
If such things have pushed Mr Saddam close to desperation, it is also the
case that he has little room to manoeuvre. He may well consider a military
adventure the best, perhaps even the only, means of reasserting his
leadership and distracting opponents. At least one western diplomat in the
region wondered over the weekend whether, having survived the Gulf war's
allied bombardment, Mr Saddam might believe that inviting another war was
his best hope of persuading the Iraqi people that the US, Britain and the
west are the true enemies responsible for their suffering, while attempting
once again to stoke up Islamic groups and anti-American feeling within the
region.
According to Arab diplomats, there have been recent attempts to persuade Mr
Saddam that his best hope for an eventual lifting of sanctions lay in
sitting out UN weapons monitoring programme for six months, formally
recognising Kuwait's sovereignty and continuing to lobby fiercely for a
humanitarian reprieve. Many influential Arab states, among them Egypt, might
then have been able to rally strongly behind attempts to lift the embargo.
But Mr Saddam seems to have ignored this advice. The quality of independent
information arriving to him in Baghdad is almost certainly worse now than
four years ago. At the same time, Mr Saddam is clearly more desperate today
than in August 1990.
Conventional wisdom among Arab and western diplomats, echoed widely in
yesterday's Arab press, is that Mr Saddam is once again bluffing. One Saudi
paper, al-Riyadh, even suggested the Iraqi leader was making a last defiant
gesture before conceding to the recognition of Kuwait. 'Fabricating a
military situation is nothing more than prelude to more concessions,' it
said.
No-one doubts it would be folly for Mr Saddam to push his troops further
south. Given his record, however, few observers can confidently exempt him
from the capacity for folly.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Iraq Menaces Kuwait: Citizens get in supplies for new war of
nerves - There is stockpiling behind false walls in the basements but no
sign of panic

The heavy dust haze that settled over the desert seemed to envelop Kuwait in
a protective cloak. Amid the dust and the heat Kuwaitis quietly took
precautions, alert to Iraqi troop movements on Kuwait's northern border. It
is the latest chapter in a long war of nerves.
Over the weekend, Kuwaitis and other residents formed queues at petrol
stations, more in a desire to top up than from any immediate panic. They
stocked up with water and bought extra supplies from supermarkets.
They emptied many of the city's cash dispenser machines of dinars; 'same as
any other weekend,' remarked one western diplomat yesterday.
Money-changers in the souk took advantage of banks remaining closed on
Saturday as part of the Friday weekend to charge a small premium for US
dollars above the normal exchange rate of KD0.3 to the dollar.
But when banks reopened for business yesterday morning the exchange rate had
returned to normal, although one branch manager said the demand for dollars
and other foreign currencies, and for transfers overseas, was abnormally
high.
'What can you expect?' he asked. 'You can never tell what Saddam Hussein
will do.' Civil aviation traffic, however, and all public services were
unaffected by Iraq's intimidation; schools and offices continued to function
normally.
On the flight from Dubai, which was full of returning Kuwaitis and visiting
businessmen, an expatriate Arab who has lived in Kuwait for 23 years and
stayed through the seven-month Iraqi occupation in 1990-91, suggested that
Kuwaitis this time would stay put. 'They are ashamed of what happened last
time,' she said, 'and this time they are better prepared.'
Many companies and families, drawing on the experience of those who lived
through the occupation, have in the last three years built false walls in
their basements to hide their stocks, including food, valuables and
emergency items such as water, torches, batteries, and blankets.
Few Kuwaitis expect an Iraqi invasion but many are unsure and all are
relieved by the western and, above all, the US response.
But Kuwaitis need constant reassurance and scan television screens anxiously
for updates on CNN and BBC. They are in a sombre mood as the time approaches
for today's UN debate on the lifting of Iraqi sanctions.
They have no illusions about how exposed they are to Iraqi threats nor why
the west is supporting them. One-half the size of Switzerland and with only
1.5m people, Kuwait would it be insignificant were it not sitting on
one-tenth of the world's proven oil reserves. Their very exposure, they say,
is their strength.
Once again Kuwaitis have forgotten internal differences and rallied round
the government, which they applaud for having signed bilateral defence
agreements since 1991 with the US, Britain, France and Russia. But their
concern goes far beyond the UN sanctions debate.
Sheikh Saud Nasser al'Sabah, the information minister, recently stressed the
importance of Iraqi recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty and the border
redrawn by the UN in Kuwait's favour.
Except for a brief period under a short-lived military dictatorship in 1958,
Iraq has never recognised its border with Kuwait, drawn up by the British in
1920. has Kuwaitis have noted with concern that Iraq's deputy prime minister
Tariq Aziz failed to address the question of recognition in his speech last
Friday at the UN.
The UN sanctions debate only focus on the link between the lifting of
sanctions and the destruction of Iraq's weapons capability. But Kuwaitis
will not rest easy until Iraq accepts the existing border and Kuwait's
sovereignty, and agrees to the return of several hundred Kuwaiti detainees
inside Iraq.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Western groups sign Russian telecoms deal
</HEADLINE>

   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, the German state operator, and US West, a
US Baby Bell regional operator, have signed a memorandum of understanding
with Russian partners to develop Russia's long distance telephone network.
The initial investment to launch the project will be only 'several hundred
million' dollars, but the Russian ministry of communications believes it
could lead to a total investment of Dollars 40bn over the next decade. It
will be channelled through a joint venture company.
Meanwhile, AT&amp;T, the biggest US operator, has signed an agreement with three
Russian operators to upgrade Moscow's telecoms network, providing 400,000
new phone lines. The four-year project is expected to cost Dollars 200m.
AT&amp;T said it would give Moscow upgraded digital telecoms facilities
'comparable to other cities with modern networks'.
Analysts believe these investments and others announced in recent months,
although significant, fall far short of the level required to provide Russia
with a modern telecoms network by the turn of the century.
According to the World Bank, the former eastern bloc requires between
Dollars 10bn and Dollars 15bn of telecoms investment a year - about half of
it from the private sector - if it is to build a basic telecoms
infrastructure by 2000. Russia has barely 15 phone lines per 100 people,
compared with 43 in western Europe.
France Telecom said its project with Deutsche Telekom and US West would
include the construction of 50,000km of fibre optic cables, and could result
in a doubling of Russia's 22m telephone lines.
However, the three western telecoms groups and their two Russian partners -
Russian Overlay Network and Rostelecom - have yet to develop a business plan
for the project, and one is not expected to be agreed until next year.
The project has been dubbed 50x50, because it envisages the construction of
50,000km of fibre optic cables and more than 50 digital exchanges.
According to a statement from the three western companies, the capital will
be raised from their own resources, the sale of telephone concessions and by
the participation of investors.

FT  10 OCT 94 / European Press Review: Media show signs of election fatigue
 -Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps it was always inevitable that in an election marathon year in
Germany, with no fewer than 20 polls, exhaustion would set in before the
bitter end. With 15 down and five to go, the German media are showing signs
of a severe surfeit of politicking.
Far from flooding their readers and viewers with a torrent of conflicting
information from the parties' headquarters, they have opted for the
opposite: play it down and keep it simple.
Election issues are barely discussed. The only real focus is on the opinion
polls, the personalities, and the possible permutations in coalition
government which could emerge after next Sunday's poll.
It is not as if the outcome is beyond doubt. Everything suggests that the
result is on a knife-edge, in spite of a surge in support for Chancellor
Helmut Kohl through the summer months. It all depends on whether Mr Kohl's
current coalition partners, the Free Democratic party, can get into the
Bundestag at all. And the other unknown factor is whether the former East
German communists - the party of Democratic Socialism - will not sneak in
and end up holding the balance of power.
Given that uncertainty, and the stark choice between the current
conservative-liberal coalition, the left-wing alternative of Social
Democrats and Greens, and a grand coalition from centre-left to
centre-right, one might expect saturation coverage. Far from it.
The mighty Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, for example, has led its front
page over the past week with a speech by the federal president on German
unification, President Boris Yeltsin promising a steady reform course in
Russia, upheaval in the Italian coalition government in Rome, the conflict
in Bosnia, and Iraqi President Saddam's troop manoeuvres on the Kuwait
border. The election has merited no more than a couple of leaders and a
front-page brief.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, the mass circulation Bild Zeitung has
led twice on the affairs of Britain's Princess of Wales, and once on the
death of the actor Heinz Ruhmann, Germany's answer to Charlie Chaplin.
Politicians and their pranks don't even rate a paragraph there.
Perhaps it is because the personalities are simply too dull. Mr Kohl, for
example, is solid, provincial, safe and uninspiring. He reckons that is what
the German voters want. His rival, Mr Rudolf Scharping, appears to think the
same: he is making every effort to appear more solid, safer, duller and less
inspiring.
The media have tried to hype the polls, and they have even tried to hype the
pollsters. The Forsa opinion poll, published in the weekly newspaper Die
Woche, and on RTL television, was the first to dare to suggest that the FDP
might not be re-elected. Five worthier and more established pollsters
denounced the results as unsound, giving massive publicity to their rival on
every other television channel.
Not that the press is averse to slamming the pollsters, on whom they still
rely for most of their election-watching. It is the 'Sunday question' - 'Who
would you vote for if there were elections on Sunday?' - which is the
original sin of the pollsters, thundered the left-of-centre Frankfurter
Rundschau this weekend.
'Originally this was just one indicator among many, with which one tried to
identify the current political mood,' the newspaper said. 'But then the
opinion researchers themselves were instrumental in elevating the answers to
this question to the level of a prophecy.' They should realise that the
modern media will publish the results in the most simplistic way, without
any serious effort at explanation, or indication of the margin of error,
says the Rundschau's Mr Martin Winter. Which leaves it less than clear who
is to blame.
After the polls have been exhausted, all that is really left for the press
is the personalities. And that is really how Mr Kohl wants it, because he
towers (literally) above the rest, and has fought his whole campaign on his
personality, not his politics.
Even in these last few days, as the newspapers cast desperately around for a
new theme, the chancellor managed to oblige: he promised to stay in office -
if elected - for the full term until 1998. But would he resign, or would he
not, after 1998?
The fact that he declined to give any clear answer to the question does not
appear to have deterred any of the newspapers from instant speculation. It
gave a whole new lease of life to the weekend columnists.
The Hessische Allgemeine, from Kassel, put it succinctly: 'That is the price
of the media society: everyone reports on an event which isn't one. That the
chancellor announces something which has long been known is barely worth
reporting. But it still gets written.
'Helmut Kohl has often enough complained of the power of the media, and
always managed to present himself as the loser. But it is perfectly clear
(on this occasion) that he is the one who sets the tone.
'Everyone one came along, and they all presented him with a first-class
election campaign appearance, on prime time, and on all the front pages.' He
could scarcely ask for more.

FT  10 OCT 94 / German Elections: Business reluctant to buy Scharping - The
SPD leader's bid for the management vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rudolf Scharping, the Social Democrat (SPD) leader, was out of luck when
he went trawling for a big-fish business name to join his election campaign
team at the end of August. The best he could net was Mr Daniel Goeudevert,
the fallen and faded star of the Volkswagen management board, most recently
spotted earning a crust as a model in a computer advertisement.
Although he has angled deftly - no thanks to Mr Goeudevert's suggestion that
the ex-communist Party of Democratic Socialism was not as red as it was
painted - Mr Scharping looks like having equally little luck catching the
management-class vote at next weekend's federal election.
According to a poll of 500 German managers last week, a mere 8 per cent
consider Mr Scharping a suitable chancellor. And while only about 48 per
cent of the population at large say they will vote for the current coalition
parties, 78 per cent of managers are backing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
alliance of Christian Democrats, the Christian Social Union and liberal Free
Democrats.
The fact that a solid 80 per cent prefer Mr Kohl to Mr Scharping appears to
be at odds with the regular blasts delivered in the chancellor's direction
by such eminent industrial mouthpieces as Mr Hans-Peter Stihl, president of
the federal chamber of trade and industry. But the better-the-devil-you-know
factor is clearly at work.
Although Mr Stihl, heard earlier this year comparing Bonn's economic policy
and Germany's economic future with the style and prospects of a local league
soccer side, has not recanted, he has since decided that the government's
own-goal scoring rate would be even worse under the SPD.
His opinion has doubtless been coloured by the calculations - and activities
 -of number-crunchers in Frankfurt. Foreign analysts in particular have
advised their employers to prepare sell orders for D-Mark investments in the
event of accidents such as the induction of Chancellor Scharping. A
precautionary sell-off which last week helped drive the Frankfurt stock
exchange's DAX index of 30 leading shares down to the year's low is also
likely to have played a role in consolidating corporate support for the
status quo in Bonn.
German analysts, typically, have been more circumspect so far and expect the
shock of any change to wear off quickly. But their main guiding principle
has been a common if Delphic view elicited in an informal FT sampling of
German business opinion on the outcome of the election.
There is a standard reply to questions on the result: 'We do not expect any
major changes/surprises/shocks.' This portmanteau attitude, while apparently
supportive of Mr Kohl, also encapsulates the rose-tinted expectation that
even if the SPD joins government in a grand coalition with the conservatives
 -judged in business circles to be the second most likely outcome to a
continuation of the present government - it will mean business as usual.
As Mr Adolf Rosenstock, senior economist at the Industrial Bank of Japan in
Frankfurt, points out, the SPD has been a de facto coalition partner for
years. Since it commands a majority in the Bundesrat or upper house of
parliament, which enjoys considerable powers to block legislation, the
solution of important differences has long demanded compromise and
consensus-building.
However, such bright-eyed scenarios appear to be based on the shaky
assumption that the decent, charming Mr Scharping would be able to smother
the ambitions and voices of his more bumptious election-campaign cohorts, Mr
Gerhard Schroder, Lower Saxony premier, and Mr Oskar Lafontaine, the
vinegary prime minister from the Saar.
Mr Schroder, who runs an active, interventionist economics policy in his
home state, makes no secret of his view that he would make a better
chancellor than his official party leader. He certainly emerged favourably
from last week's poll of managerial opinion in which 50 per cent of the
interviewees said they would rather have him as economics minister than the
present incumbent, Mr Gunther Rexrodt. Sadly, they were not asked the
question Mr Schroder and many others of all party hues would like to hear
answered: how he is rated against Mr Kohl?

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German election next Sunday could produce a stalemate between Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's existing conservative-liberal coalition and the rival parties
of the left, according to the latest opinion poll, writes Quentin Peel in
Bonn. The survey, carried out by the Emnid research group for Der Spiegel
magazine and the ntv television news broadcaster, suggests that Mr Kohl's
Christian Democrats would win 42 per cent, and his Free Democratic party
allies just 6 per cent - a 1 per cent drop on the week.
The opposition Social Democrats (SPD) were backed by 37 per cent in the
poll, and their potential partners, the Greens, by 7 per cent. The Party of
Democratic Socialism (PDS), the former East German communists, which could
get into the Bundestag by winning at least three constituencies outright,
was supported by 4 per cent.
Although the SPD insists it would not use PDS support to gain power, the
stalemate might force a grand coalition between the Christian Democrats and
Social Democrats.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Paris seeks to alter EU talks agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France's parliament, in a display of anti-Maastricht pique not often
associated with Paris, has pushed its government into requesting European
finance ministers to refrain today from discussing the French budget
deficit.
The German presidency of the EU finance ministers meeting in Luxembourg will
not want to accede to the French request. Germany is keen to see debate on
Maastricht's fiscal disciplines and France is one of 10 countries that
figure in a Commission recommendation on 'excessive budget deficits' that
the Council of Ministers is being asked to approve.
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur last July promised MPs they would be
consulted on draft EU legislation before it went to the Council of Ministers
and that Paris would object to the Council changing its agenda less than 14
days before a meeting.
Mr Philippe Seguin, the anti-Maastricht president of the National Assembly,
last week leapt on the technicality that the Commission's 'excessive budget'
recommendation was only put on the Council agenda five days ago. On Friday
he helped persuade the parliament's EU affairs committee to pass a unanimous
resolution asking Mr Balladur to carry out his July promise. Later today the
parliament's finance committee is to review what transpired in Luxembourg.
Mr Seguin has been able to play on the irritation of many MPs that the
Luxembourg debate should be taking place a day before the National Assembly
starts debate on France's 1995 budget. A spokesman for Mr Seguin said it was
'an encroachment on French parliamentary sovereignty'. But the presidential
election season is opening in France and Mr Seguin, who supports Mr Jacques
Chirac against rival-Gaullist Mr Balladur, is not averse to stirring up
trouble for the government.
An Ifop opinion poll in yesterday's Journal du Dimanche for the first time
put Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president and a Socialist,
ahead in a first- round vote for the presidency, giving him 20 per cent, 19
per cent for Mr Balladur and 10 per cent for Mr Chirac. In the second round
run-off, Mr Delors would be beaten by Mr Balladur (51-49 per cent) but would
win against Mr Chirac (54-46 per cent).

FT  10 OCT 94 / Spaniards make a meal of feast day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the church and civil society clash over holidays in Spain the manana
syndrome asserts itself in all its laid back glory.
Because December 6 - a public holiday marking the endorsement by referendum
of Spain's post-Franco constitution - falls on a Tuesday, and December 8 -
the Roman Catholic feast of the Immaculate Conception, one of the several
religious public holidays in the calendar - falls on a Thursday, many
Spaniards will take the whole week off just a fortnight before the Christmas
partying starts.
The employment ministry bowed to the inevitable over the weekend when its
efforts to contain the damage by bunching the two holidays together came to
nothing. The trade unions refused to have the constitution day holiday moved
forward to Friday December 9 and the bishops opposed bringing the Immaculate
Conception feast back to Monday December 5.
Earlier, the ministry had drawn the combined fire of the unions and the
bishops by attempting to negotiate moving both the holidays to successive
Mondays.
The result is that, in addition to the expected massive absenteeism during
the nominally working days of the first week of December, many industrial
plants will grind to a halt during the whole period because the transport of
dangerous goods is banned on a public holiday and on the eve of a holiday.
The ministry's woeful negotiating skills, and the obstinacy of both unions
and bishops, came in for sharp criticism from the employers, save those in
the travel and hotel business who have reported very strong bookings over
the week.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Russia and west split on Europe's security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Growing differences between most western nations and Russia over the future
of European security are expected to surface at a conference of 53 nations
which begins today in Budapest. Russian officials want the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) to be transformed from a weak
talking shop into a powerful institution which could effectively manage the
division of Europe and the former Soviet Union into western and Russian
spheres of influence.
The ideas mooted by Russia include the creation of a 10-nation steering
committee - with the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany as permanent
members, and the other seats rotating - that could intervene in conflicts
and allocate peacekeeping mandates.
During the recent ceremonies in Berlin marking the Russian withdrawal from
Germany, General Pavel Grachev, Russia's defence minister, redoubled calls
for the CSCE to become the apex of a new European security structure which
would subsume both Nato and the Commonwealth of Independent States.
In Russia's vision, the CSCE committee would license Nato, the CIS or forces
drawn from both blocs to maintain peace in regional trouble spots. Most
western nations, in particular the US and Britain, have rejected this idea
out of hand, but senior German officials have suggested there is room for a
little movement in the direction Russia is proposing. Germany and the
Netherlands have aired proposals for the CSCE to become a kind of
intermediary between its members and the United Nations, but this has met
with a cool response from English-speaking countries.
Critics have suggested that Russia wants to use the CSCE to gain as much
influence as possible over the decisions of Nato, while gaining maximum
freedom of action for its own military activities in the southern republics
of the CIS.
Western CSCE members were taken aback during the summer by Russia's abrupt
withdrawal of support from a draft set of 'peacekeeping guidelines',
apparently because the text provided for too much western influence over
Russia's military posture in central Asia and Transcaucasia. Other versions
of the text - giving Russia a freer hand  - have been endorsed by Moscow but
so far rejected by the west.
The two-month meeting which starts today will provide an important sign of
the success or failure of Russia's diplomatic offensive. President Boris
Yeltsin wants the session to culminate in December with a meeting attended
by himself, President Bill Clinton and as many other leaders of CSCE nations
as possible. But it remains unclear whether the US president will go to
Budapest.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Spain to speed up telecoms deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spain has given a clear signal that it wants to keep abreast of the European
Union's richer economies by waiving a five- year transition phase for the
deregulation of its telecommunications sector and announcing that
Telefonica's monopoly as a national operator will end on January 1 1998, as
laid down by the European Commission's fast route timetable for the
industry.
Hailed as a 'leap forward of historic dimensions' by Mr Felipe Gonzalez,
prime minister, the deregulation package drawn up by the government has
Spain tracking the telecommunications sectors in France and in Germany and
rejecting the slower liberalisation route mapped out for weaker EU economies
such as Portugal and Greece which allow state-controlled monopoly operators
until 2003 to adjust to the open market.
The development opens the door to large telecommunications investment in
Spain - in the short term large sums are likely to be routed towards the
cable television business - but it is also a political indicator of the
government's ambitions to catch up with the core of Europe and, in so doing,
to decouple from the EU's poorer peripheral members.
The measures, which were announced after a Friday cabinet meeting, are
nevertheless weighted towards a continued dominance of Telefonica in the
domestic market and they also favour Spanish telecommunications companies.
Telefonica, which is 32 per cent government-owned, will have one of the two
future cable television licences in order to protect its telephone business.
This reflects an earlier ruling which reserves one of the two new mobile
telephone licences to be awarded later this year for the monopoly operator
and invites the private sector to bid for the second licence.
A main plank of the deregulation initiative is to assist the development of
domestic telecommunications groups. The government therefore said it would
favour a primarily Spanish consortium as the second basic telephony operator
in 1998.
In addition, the authority which will regulate the future cable and local
television networks and oversee the deregulation process is to be a
department of the transport and telecommunications ministry whose present
incumbent, Mr Jose Borrell, has long been viewed as a determined protector
of Telefonica's monopoly privileges.

FT  10 OCT 94 / UN aid flights to Sarajevo resume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Nations aid flights to Sarajevo got into full swing yesterday for the
first time in nearly three weeks, despite Saturday's sniper attack on trams
in the city centre in which one civilian died and 11 were injured.
The resumption of the air bridge marked a success for the UN's mediation
efforts, after several days in which it has been accused of bias and
ineffectiveness by both Bosnian government and Bosnian Serb officials.
UN officials said about 20 aircraft flew to Sarajevo yesterday, bringing
desperately needed supplies to a city where food stocks were threatening to
run out in less than a week.
The UN's humanitarian operation, vital to sustain the city's 300,000
inhabitants, was disrupted after the Serbs, angered by an air attack last
month, started firing on flights.
General Sir Michael Rose, UN commander, sought to mend relations with
Bosnia's Moslem leadership by denying, in a newspaper interview, that he
would ever ask for air strikes against the government side. stressed that
the Bosnian government was the legitimate leadership of a UN member country
which had been the victim of aggression.
He also indicated that last week's killing of 16 Bosnian Serb soldiers and
four nurses by government troops was now viewed as an ordinary military
action and not an atrocity, as the UN had initially alleged.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Baltics struggle to muster a credible defence: Russia's army
left little when it departed, except poorly trained conscripts and a Soviet
military ethic of dubious value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Russian army left the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania, it took every piece of useful military hardware which was not
nailed down. To complete the job, much of what was nailed down was ruined:
the vandalism was so petty that even barracks toilets had concrete poured
into the plumbing to make them unusable.
As a result, the Baltic states, poor and poorly organised, have little
effective defence against their heavyweight neighbour. The three countries
have only small arms, a few thousand barely trained conscripts, a greater
number of enthusiastic but amateur home guards and some ex-Soviet
professional soldiers of varying honesty. What is worse, neither Estonia,
Latvia nor Lithuania has any money to improve matters. There is no doubt
that if the Russians decided to re-invade tomorrow, they would face little
effective resistance.
Small wonder then that the Baltic states are looking to the west for help.
The objective of all three is full membership of Nato in the shortest
possible order, but most Baltic military commanders and politicians are
realistic enough to know that remains a long term ambition.
Nato would be reluctant to commit itself to the defence of areas a long way
forward of its main bases, and is also sensitive to Russian concerns. The
idea that the Baltic states could become a forward base from which Nato
power could threaten Moscow plays into the hands of Russian hardliners.
Nato is probably also unwilling to incorporate countries which cannot pay
for their own defence. 'Nato membership is a matter of responsibilities as
well as rights,' said Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, recently.
'We have no objection in principle to expanding Nato membership, but
potential members must be able to make a contribution.'
While they work towards full membership, all three countries are desperately
seeking diplomatic and military ties which pull them into the western sphere
and out of Russia's orbit. All have signed up for Nato's Partnership for
Peace initiative, which offers co-operation and joint exercises; they have
also agreed to form a Baltic battalion which would be available for UN
peacekeeping operations. The working language of the battalion will be
English, and the troops will be trained by Scandinavian and British
soldiers.
Political visits, such as that by Mr Rifkind last week, are another
important signal which the Balts wish to use to strengthen their position.
The Baltic defence strategy currently is to raise the political price of any
Russian interference. If the Baltic states' profile is sufficiently high in
the west, a colonially-minded Russian leadership might decide that pressure
on the states was not worth the candle.
If that strategy is to work, however, the Baltic states will have to reform
their armed forces sufficiently to work with the west. That is no small task
because equipment and properly working barracks are not all they lack. Since
their previous defence forces were the ex-Soviet army, they have no
indigenous military structures. Those regular officers who are available
served with Soviet forces. Many of them still cleave to Soviet military
doctrines and do not wish to learn Nato-style methods. Some are also
corrupt.
These concerns have led Estonia to appoint a retired US Army colonel and
Estonian emigre, Aleksander Einseln, as armed forces commander on a salary
of Dollars 700 a month. 'We have to build a professional armed force under
civilian rule,' said Gen Einseln last week. 'When I first took this job on
(last year) I thought it would take two years, but I was too optimistic. It
would have been better to start from scratch, because then we wouldn't have
had to get rid of all the old Soviet habits.'
Gen Einseln, who says he has 'no plans to invade Russia before the year
3000' is also finding it hard to bridge the cultural gap with his ex-Soviet
colleagues. 'I come from a place where the norm is to tell the truth. Here
the norm is to lie.'
Latvia and Lithuania have even further to go in reforming their armed
forces, not least because many senior officers do not accept the need to
move to western ways.
Besides reform, the Balts must also hang together if they are to secure
western assistance. The states have little in common save geography and
compete for export markets for many of their products. The rivalry runs
deep: Mr Rifkind signed co-operation agreements in all three states last
week, and observers in each country were keen to know how their memorandum
differed from the others. Deep down, army commanders may know they need to
co-operate and offer each other security guarantees, but there is little
political drive to do so.
The most immediate aim for all three states, however, is to construct
credible defence forces. In that they are being realistic: the assistance
they are asking from Nato members is mostly training, rather than heavy
weapons which they could not use effectively.
Yet the legacy of 50 years of Soviet occupation is heavy, and has seeped
into every corner of life. In one example which stands as a metaphor,
military airfields, and the surrounding water tables, have been contaminated
with aviation fuel. During Soviet rule Russian pilots, reluctant to train in
aircraft they considered unsafe, falsified their flight logs. Unfortunately,
this left them with an embarrassing amount of unused fuel, so before the
regular tanker deliveries arrived they drained the excess into nearby
fields. It is going to take the Baltic states a long time to clean up the
mess.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Industry chiefs press Clarke for investment Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of seven big industry associations have signed an open letter to Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, urging action in next month's Budget to
stimulate permanently higher levels of investment and improve the UK's
competitiveness.
The letter, delivered to Mr Clarke on Friday and faxed to senior Treasury
officials, marks the first time manufacturing industry has made a united
plea for tax incentives and other steps to boost investment.
Timed to reach the chancellor before this week's Tory party conference in
Bournemouth, it is part of a campaign to keep manufacturing on the agenda in
the run-up to the Budget.
The letter is based on an initiative this summer by the Machine Tool
Technologies Association. The other six organisations are the Confederation
of British Industry, the Engineering Employers Federation, the Society of
Motor Manufacturers and Traders, Metcom (the Mechanical and Metal Trades
Confederation), Beama (the federation of British Electrotechnical and Allied
Manufacturers' Associations) and the Federation of the Electronics Industry
The letter says investment levels in the UK have been lower than in most
industrial countries for most of the past 30 years.
Without permanently higher levels of investment, it says, the UK faces 'the
prospect of further boom and bust cycles of the kind we have so often seen
and suffered from in the past'.
The industry associations want the chancellor in his Budget to:
Introduce full first-year capital allowances for at least the first Pounds
200,000 of plant and mach-inery. They say this would benefit smaller
companies.
Index-link current capital allowances for plant and machinery.
Reform capital gains tax for holdings of corporate equity, with the rate
reduced according to the period for which the investment has been held.
This, they say, would encourage investors to take a longer-term view.
At least maintain spending on transport infrastructure, education, training
and export support in real terms.
Some of the organisations have made their own Budget submissions. But the
united plea on investment follows past disappointments when they campaigned
separately - notably on capital allowances, where a limited, temporary
scheme was allowed to lapse last year.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Claims on Thatcher arms link upset Tory leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party last night sought to distance itself from
embarrassing allegations on the eve of its annual conference that Lady
Thatcher's son Mark made Pounds 12m in commissions from a Saudi Arabian arms
deal while she was prime minister.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry spokesman, called for an
independent public inquiry 'to get to the bottom of the allegations'.
As the Conservative party tried to reassert its own agenda in the face of
Labour attacks over the 'sleaze factor', one minister conceded the
allegations were 'most unhelpful' coming just before Lady Thatcher is due to
attend the conference in Bournemouth tomorrow.
Conservative Central Office sought to distance the government from Lady
Thatcher's administration of the 1980s. 'Allegations surrounding the son of
a former prime minister who has been out of office for four years are of
historical interest,' said a senior spokesman. Ministers, however, were
irritated by yesterday's report in The Sunday Times which alleged that Mr
Mark Thatcher was among a team of middlemen who earned between them Pounds
240m in commission payments from the Al-Yamamah deal with Saudi Arabia.
Mr Cook said: 'The Scott inquiry into arms sales to Iraq provides a good
model for what is now needed. We need an independent investigation to get to
the bottom of these serious allegations.
'There are two main questions that must be answered: what influence did Mark
Thatcher sell in return for these millions and how much did Mrs Thatcher use
her public office to promote her son to make a private fortune?'
Mr Cook said Mr Michael Heseltine should set up the inquiry since he was now
trade and industry secretary and had been the defence secretary who signed
the deal 10 years ago.
The Sunday Times also alleged that Lady Thatcher had been warned by civil
servants about the potential damaging consequences of her son's involvement
in the Saudi Arabian arms deal.
Mr Robert Sheldon, the Labour chairman of the Commons public accounts
committee, called yesterday for wider powers to track public money across
departments. 'The committee needs wider powers to follow public money
wherever it goes,' he said.
'I have argued for this very strongly and will continue to do so in light of
the recent allegations surrounding the Al-Yamamah deal.'
Mr Sheldon was instrumental in deciding that a report into the deal by the
National Audit Office, a government watchdog committee, was not published on
the grounds of national security.
He said yesterday there had been no evidence the Ministry of Defence had
done anything wrong in sanctioning the deal. But he stressed that his
committee could only investigate individual government departments.
Mr Michael Meacher, Labour's spokesman for open government, demanded that
the report be published in full.
Mr Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP who raised Mr Thatcher's involvement in the
deal two years ago, said: 'I shall return to the subject when the House
reassembles as I believe that this whole case should be pursued in
Parliament.'

FT  10 OCT 94 / Berlusconi urged to let trust manage his Fininvest empire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Proposals for Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, to step back from
his Fininvest business empire won cautious approval yesterday from his
coalition ally, the populist Northern League, but met with a cool response
from opposition leaders.
Mr Umberto Bossi, the League's leader, said that the proposals by a
commission of three jurists were 'a step forward'. The report, which was
handed over to the Senate at the weekend by Mr Berlusconi, has suggested
that he either sell Fininvest, Italy's second largest private group, or
appoint a trust to manage it in order to avoid a conflict of interest.
Mr Berlusconi, who commissioned the report on taking office in May, had been
sitting on it for 11 days and has so far refused to comment. The Senate will
today begin discussing the proposals, which are not binding.
Mr Bossi, sounding a note of scepticism, said the plan represented 'an
Italian type of 'blind trust' where very little is actually blind'. The
opposition Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), the former Communist party,
criticised it as being too little, too late.
Mr Cesare Slavi, the PDS spokesman in the Senate, welcomed the fact that the
report accepted a conflict of interest existed. But he said the contents
were too vague and lacked teeth, especially over sanctions.
The report avoids any mention of the need to reveal the full nature of
ownership of a business. Mr Berlusconi's ownership of Fininvest is obscured
behind 22 holding companies and two fiduciaries (trusts).
The jurists suggest that any member of government must within 40 days of
taking office make a full statement of business interests. If a person holds
interests of L50bn (Pounds 20.4m) or more, he must sell them or hand over
their administration to a trustee on a fiduciary basis. The report rules out
enforced divestiture as unconstitutional. Mr Berlusconi has consistently
refused to contemplate a forced sale.
All non-media interests would be assessed by the existing anti-trust
authority which would retain monitoring powers over any conflict of interest
arising in the case of assets being managed by a trustee. Media interests -
a specific reference to Mr Berlusconi's three commercial TV channels - would
be monitored by the media watchdog commission.
The Senate discussion will take place against the backdrop of two conflicts
of interest.
The first concerns Mr Berlusconi's battle with the Milan magistrature over
its investigations into Fininvest. Last week, the cabinet sent a complaint
to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro over the behaviour of Mr Francesco Saverio
Borrelli, the Milan public prosecutor. The second concerns the government's
takeover of management and editorial control of Rai, the state broadcasting
organisation, which is a direct competitor to Mr Berlusconi's TV channels.

FT  10 OCT 94 / US warns Saddam of 'horrendous' price for war: Kuwait sends
troops to Iraqi border - 2,000 marines arrive in Gulf
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The US stepped up deployment of a 'formidable force' of troops, warships and
jets in the Gulf yesterday and warned Iraq it would pay an 'horrendous
price' if President Saddam Hussein ordered an invasion of Kuwait.
The warning, from Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, came as
thousands of Iraqi troops continued to mass near Kuwait's border.
In Kuwait City, residents formed queues at petrol stations, stocked up with
water and bought extra supplies from supermarkets. Banks reported unusually
heavy demand for dollars.
Kuwait has called up reservists and sent some 20,000 men - thought to be its
entire army - near its border with Iraq, and moved up 50 tanks.
Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said 'many squadrons' of F-15, F-16
and A-10 jets together with Awacs early-warning aircraft were being sent to
the region.
By late yesterday, 2,000 ship-borne marines had arrived in the Gulf and
4,000 more troops were due to arrive in Kuwait to operate tanks and armoured
personnel carriers positioned there after the 1991 Gulf war. Another 18,000
marines would begin moving to the region within days and about 14,000
infantry troops were also expected to be sent, a US defence offical said. In
addition, warships armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles were on their way to
the Gulf and the Red Sea.
Mr Christopher, in Jerusalem on the first leg of a Middle East peace
shuttle, said that Mr Saddam would be subjecting Iraq to 'devastation' if
his forces crossed into Kuwait.
'We're moving a lot of forces in there at the present time. It will be some
time, I think, before his forces are ready and we're in a very strong
deterrent mode.'
Mr Christopher said he would visit Kuwait during his week-long tour of the
region.
The US show of strength came amid reports that Iraq was deploying as many as
14,000 more troops and support armour towards the Kuwaiti border. US
officials said a 64,000-strong Iraqi force would soon be in place. Mr Hamed
Youssef Hammadi, Iraq's information minister, confirmed on Radio Monte Carlo
that Iraqi troops were within 20km of the Kuwaiti border - just 5km north of
the demilitarised zone straddling the border and policed by the
lightly-armed United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission.
However, Iraq's intentions in massing troops north of Kuwait were no clearer
yesterday, although the state-run Baghdad Radio repeated threats that Iraq
would take unspecified 'measures' if the UN Security Council did not take
immediate steps to ease the four-year-old embargo on oil exports, which has
devastated the country's economy.
The commentary said Iraq had the 'right to take any measures' to defend
itself in the face of what it called 'an injustice of unprecedented
proportions' being inflicted by the UN, the US and Gulf neighbours.
Iraq appears to be attempting to force the hand of the Security Council
which will this week consider a report from Mr Rolf Ekeus, the UN envoy,
that comprehensive systems to monitor Iraq's chemical, nuclear, biological
and long-range missile manufacturing potential are ready to become
operational.
Iraqi officials have said that this means they are in compliance with UN
Gulf war ceasefire resolutions and sanctions should therefore be eased
immediately. Britain and the US have said they oppose setting any definite
criteria for lifting sanctions now. The US says Iraq has failed to comply
with the bulk of such resolutions and remains a regional threat. Iraq said
last night it was hoping for a diplomatic solution to the crisis, and
Russia, France and China - all permanent members of the Security Council -
were working on this.
In Kuwait City, the arrival offshore of a British frigate, HMS Cornwall,
provided a visible sign of US and British military support, an operation
that officials said would take several days to put fully in place.

FT  10 OCT 94 / Investors poised to flood into Russia if rules are tightened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign investment capital is forecast to 'flood' into the Russian market if
the government can reform regulations which cast doubt on the legality of
share and property purchases by foreigners.
Prospective investors and analysts have poured into Moscow in the past two
months to examine the Russian market. But they are hampered by rules that
often fail to conform to foreign, especially US, legislation governing the
activities of pension and other investment funds.
One senior manager of a large US investment house predicted over the weekend
that if appropriate legislation were put in place, Dollars 20bn to Dollars
25bn (Pounds 12.6bn to Pounds 15.8bn) could flood into Russian 'within six
months'. He and some other fund managers played down the political risk,
arguing that the process of market change was too far advanced to be
radically altered by almost any occupant of the Kremlin.
CS First Boston, the international investment bank, estimates foreign
portfolio investment this year may exceed Dollars 3bn.
However, Mr Martin Andersson, chief executive of Brunswick, a Swedish-owned,
Moscow-based stockbroker, warned: 'In many respects, Russia is a
pre-emerging market and lacks many of the most basic playing rules. We will
see a number of problems and scandals in the market. That is only to be
expected.'
Under US legislation, particularly the 1940 Investment Act, mutual and other
fund managers cannot invest in foreign stocks unless there is easy access to
share ownership records, assets can be freely traded and the rights of
property are clearly defined.
None of this is exists in Russia - and in some cases, the only register of
the purchase of a share is in one ledger in an office thousands of miles
from Moscow, which could be susceptible to either fraud or accidental loss
or destruction. Asset prices in Russia have shot up without any effective
settlement system in place.
A World Bank study this month noted that privatisation had put 14,000
companies employing more than 14m workers into the private sector -
'achievements made in the absence of consensus on the desirability, scope
and pace of liberalising reform in general and privatisation in particular,
and without what would normally be considered the requisite administrative
and financial resources to implement, monitor and enforce a privatisation
programme of this magnitude'.
Ms Danielle Downing, director of Russian investments at CA, a Russian
stockbroker, said share registration was the big hurdle for mainstream
western investors: 'But there should be infrastructure in place within the
next six months, and we think that most of the emerging market funds would
put 5-10 per cent of their weightings in the Russian market once that
happened'.
A number of Russian government ministers, including Mr Anatoly Chubais, the
deputy premier for privatisation and Mr Sergei Vassiliev, deputy economics
minister, are working on legislation for a Securities Exchange Commission
which would answer the needs of foreign investors.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Plastic heart of a new age man of many parts: We have the
technology, we can rebuild the human body. Clive Cookson examines the latest
advances in medical science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
My childhood science books used to portray the human body as a complicated
machine. This idea made me wonder why old people could not go to hospital to
have worn bits of their body replaced, in the same way as broken-down cars
were fixed in a garage. By the time I studied science at university in the
1970s, it was fashionable to look at the body as a whole biological system
rather than as a machine with separate parts.
Now, with the proportion of broken-down old people in the population
increasing rapidly, the machine analogy is making more sense again. One
reason is that modern medicine can indeed provide a wide range of spare
parts. Primitive implants are becoming available to replace many human
organs: ears, eyes and nose; bones and joints; skin and ligaments; hearts
and kidneys.
These implants are made from an astonishingly diverse range of materials:
hard metals and ceramics; soft plastics and foams; biological implants made
by 'tissue engineering' from living cells; even electronic circuits designed
to replace failed nerves.
Anyone fitted with all the different spare parts available today would
indeed be a bionic man or woman, but with a creaking performance far removed
from a sci-fi superhero. For no implant works as well as the original human
version.
Although the vast majority of implants have improved the lives of their
recipients, there are also failures - some of which leave patients with even
more pain and disability than they had before. Indeed suing manufacturers on
behalf of 'victims' is a lucrative sideline for the American legal
profession.
'The problem is that all current devices for all parts of the body have a
limited lifetime,' says Professor William Bonfield, head of the
Interdisciplinary Research Centre in Biomedical Materials at Queen Mary and
Westfield College, London. However, as scientists begin to understand which
chemical and physical properties of materials make them compatible with the
human body, the outlook for more permanent implants is becoming brighter.
'There has been a change of philosophy recently,' says Professor Chris
Wilkinson, a bio-engineering pioneer at Glasgow University. 'You used to try
to make your material as inert as possible - and you assumed your
engineering skills were better than the body's. Now we accept that the body
is more clever than us.'
Research today aims to produce implants that knit together with the body's
own tissues. The key factor here, according to Professor Colin Humphreys, a
biomaterials specialist at Cambridge University, is not so much the chemical
nature of the implant as its micro-structure. The material must have a shape
and texture that is compatible with living tissues on the scale of a few
nanometres - millionths of a millimetre. 'If it does not have the right
nano-structure, it will not work,' he says.
A good example of the new focus on micro-structure is Bonfield's project at
Queen Mary and Westfield College 'to design from scratch an artificial bone
that will fit as well as possible with the real thing.' His team has come up
with a composite material containing hydroxy-apatite, the main mineral in
bone, blended with plastic.
Although hydroxy-apatite has been used before, Bonfield believes his
material is the first with the same nano-crystalline structure as natural
bone. The result, when it is put next to osteoblasts (bone-producing cells),
is that tiny whiskers of bone grow cleanly into the implant. Clinical tests
of the material are showing that it can successfully repair the cheekbones
of people whose faces have been disfigured by disease or accident. Thirty
patients have already received the implants and 400 more are due to take
part in an extended clinical trial.
As with most researchers developing bio-materials, Bonfield's goal is to
move into hip joints - the biggest sector of the implant market. According
to Frost &amp; Sullivan, a Californian market research company, US sales of hip
implants will be worth Dollars 810m this year.
Artificial hips, introduced in the early 1960s, give new mobility to 500,000
people a year worldwide whose own joints have been ruined by arthritis and
other diseases. The natural hip is a ball-and-socket joint. Its replacement
involves cutting off the round head of the patient's thigh bone and
hammering in a metal spike to which a new ball is attached; at the same
time, the natural socket in the pelvis is cut out and replaced with an
artificial cup made from metal lined with plastic. Both components of the
artificial joint are conventionally cemented in place with a glue called
polymethyl methacrylate.
Total hip replacements have given good results in elderly patients, working
well for 10 to 15 years. But they last less well in people under 70, who are
more active and put more strain on their hips. Their new joints can fail
within five years - usually because the bone shrinks away from the implant,
which then works loose.
'The result is that a steadily increasing proportion of our patients are
undergoing 'revision' operations to replace artificial hips that have
already failed. Altogether about one-third of hip replacements are now
revisions,' says Richard Coombs, an orthopaedic surgeon at the Royal
Postgraduate Medical School, London. 'Our aim is the 30-year prosthesis, yet
today our youngest patients have a five to seven year revision rate.'
Repeated surgery to replace failed artificial joints is not only distressing
and risky for the patients but also expensive. The National Health Service
would save an estimated Pounds 80m a year if it did not have to carry out
second and subsequent hip replacements.
Much research into orthopaedic implants is aimed at giving the metal
components a porous surface coating - of hydroxy-apatite, for example -
which will encourage the patient's hip and thigh bones to bind naturally
with the implant. To stimulate the osteoblasts, the implant may also be
impregnated with natural chemicals called growth factors. This should give a
stronger bond than any synthetic glue.
Patience and dogged persistence are essential requirements for anyone
developing implant materials. Proving their safety and efficacy inevitably
takes many years. For example Bioglass, a ceramic bone substitute just
beginning to come into use in the US, was invented by Professor Larry Hench
at the University of Florida in 1969.
Professor Per-Ingvar Branemark of Gothenburg University, Sweden, also shows
the persistence required in bio-materials research. As a young medical
scientist working on laboratory animals in the 1950s, he discovered that
titanium, a light metal much favoured by the aerospace industry, could
secure implants firmly in living bone.
Branemark first used the system in 1965, to fix the most humble of implants
 -false teeth - with a titanium screw into a man's jaw bone. Twenty-nine
years later, that patient's dentures are still firmly in place, and 300,000
other people have had dental implants secured with the same system.
The weight of clinical evidence did not convince the world's dentists that
the Branemark system was safe and effective until the 1980s. And only in the
mid 1990s are orthopaedic and plastic surgeons beginning to take titanium
screws seriously, as a way to fix artificial joints and other body parts
permanently to patients.
'No one knows how and why the system works so well,' Branemark says, 'but
empirical findings like this are important in medicine.' Apparently, the
titanium surface is covered by a thin oxide layer whose crystalline
structure happens to be completely compatible with bone; at the same time it
contains no chemicals capable of triggering an adverse reaction from the
body's immune system.
Implant development is not only slow but may also be legally and financially
hazardous. The most spectacular demonstration of the dangers is the Dollars
4bn fund proposed by Dow Corning and other US manufacturers of silicone
breast implants, to settle litigation by thousands of women who were
allegedly harmed by the devices. Although the companies maintain that there
is no scientific evidence to link their products to the plaintiffs'
auto-immune diseases and other medical problems, some implant recipients
have undoubtedly suffered great pain - and their lawyers have successfully
portrayed them as innocent victims of corporate greed and negligence.
The silicone saga has frightened several companies off the whole implants
business. 'We have pulled out of making materials for medical implants
altogether, and a number of other companies have stopped developing medical
implants in the US because, with the potential (legal) liability, it is not
worth the risk,' says Dr Ralph Cook, Dow Corning medical director.
Another corporate victim of the implants business is Vitek, a Texan company
founded by Dr Charles Homsy to make implants out of a material called
Proplast which he has been developing for more than 20 years. Vitek went
bankrupt in 1990, crushed by the weight of lawsuits by patients who suffered
adverse reactions - including severe and intractable pain - after receiving
jaw implants containing Proplast.
Homsy believes that the fault did not lie with the material itself but
with the way it was used. He has shown his faith in it by joining a new
company in Switzerland, Promotus, to continue developing and marketing
Proplast (a porous matrix of Teflon plastic with hydroxy-apatite).
Surgeons in the Netherlands are carrying out a long-term trial of hip
implants coated with Proplast.
So much for passive implants to replace failed bones and joints. Research
into active implants, which substitute for nerves and muscles, is less
advanced but potentially more far-reaching in its implications. Already,
electronic devices are beginning to give some hearing to the deaf and
movement to the severely disabled.
Doctors have most experience with the 'cochlear implant', fitted surgically
into the bone behind the ear. It converts digitised sounds, transmitted from
a small external microphone, into electrical signals which stimulate the
auditory nerves inside the ear. These send impulses to the brain, which
interprets them as crude sounds.
Lord Ashley, the UK's best-known campaigner for the deaf, brought the
technology to public attention in Britain last year when he received a
cochlear implant. He spoke movingly of being able to hear his family again
after 25 years of silence. 'I can best describe what I hear as being like
listening to a croaking Dalek with laryngitis,' Ashley said, 'but compared
with total deafness it is a miracle.'
Devices to restore some hand movement to quadriplegic patients with broken
backs or necks are being developed at Case Western Reserve University in
Ohio. The system relies on the fact that most quadriplegics can shrug their
shoulders slightly. The movement controls a joy-stick which transmits
signals to an electronic unit under the wheelchair. This activates a
stimulator about the size of a heart pacemaker, implanted in the shoulder,
which sends electrical impulses down the arm to the paralysed hand muscles.
The experimental hand grasp system does not restore full finger movements
but it has enabled a dozen patients in the US to write, brush their hair and
teeth, hold a telephone, sew and paint. Now surgeons at Salisbury District
Hospital are preparing to test the system in the UK.
The only vital organ for which medical technology cannot yet offer any
assistance is the brain. Even that is only a matter of time. Humphreys
predicts that within 50 years it will be possible to implant memory chips to
boost our failing intellectual faculties.
'If we can design an interface between silicon chips and brain cells, the
first step will be a pre-programmed chip which the brain could read,'
Humphreys says. 'Ultimately we would like the brain not to notice the
implant and to treat it as another piece of brain tissue. Then we could get
the brain to record information on the silicon chip and read it when
necessary.'
Although Humphreys is more willing than his cautious colleagues to speculate
publicly about the future of biomedical technology, many scientists would
regard his vision as a reasonable extrapolation of current research. Most
would see brain-boosting implants - whether to extend human intelligence or
to treat diseases such as Alzheimer's - as a welcome development, not a
sci-fi nightmare.
There is an interesting paradox here. As medical scientists add increasingly
sophisticated implants to people, so robotics researchers will be giving
machines the mental and even anatomical features of humans. During the
coming Bionic Age, the distinction between human beings with implants and
humanised robots will become increasingly blurred.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Arts: A rare bird in the world of opera - Andrew Clark talks
to Herbert Wernicke, a German producer who reads music and designs all his
own productions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every work of art contains an enigma, and if there is no enigma, it is
kitsch. These words trip off Herbert Wernicke's tongue as if they were the
stuff of everyday conversation. Wernicke must be one of the most
matter-of-fact personalities on the continental opera scene today - but when
he gets to work, he is also one of the most imaginative. Few directors are
better able to balance the world of ideas with the demands of practical
theatre.
Wernicke's production of Wagner's Ring opens at the Frankfurt Opera next
Tuesday. First staged at Brussels in 1991, it was widely admired for its
clarity, immediacy and magical effects. Using a single set and
carefully-selected visual leitmotifs, it has the unity of style which
characterises all Wernicke's work. With the same conductor, Sylvain
Cambreling, and much the same cast, Frankfurt is lucky to have inherited it.
Wernicke, 48, is a rare bird among German opera producers: he can read music
and he designs all his own productions. The son of a painter and
picture-restorer, he began his career as a stage designer in the early
1970s. After directing a handful of plays, he produced his first opera in
1978, and has never looked back.
He spent much of the 1980s earning a reputation for contemporary settings of
baroque and romantic operas. The Brussels Ring was his international
breakthrough, opening the way for Boris Godunov at this year's Easter and
summer festivals at Salzburg. He has also shown a lighter side in his
uproarious operetta productions.
Forthcoming projects include the world premiere of Theo Loevendie's new
opera about the Dutch wartime resistance (at the 1995 Holland Festival), Der
Rosenkavalier for Salzburg next summer, Schoenberg's Moses und Aron for the
Chatelet in Paris and Les vepres siciliennes at the Vienna State Opera. He
would love to direct in Britain, but has never been invited.
With his narrow-rimmed spectacles, casual dress and dry humour, Wernicke is
the liberal German intellectual par excellence - but where theatre is
concerned, he is never less than practical. The walls of his atelier in
Basle are plastered with architectural plans giving the exact stage
measurements of theatres he will be working in, and his design-models have a
draughtsman's precision. 'He's not the kind of director who chooses a
concept and tries to make the opera fit', says a long-standing colleague.
'There are no counter-productive ideas. That stems from the fact that he
began as a designer. He has a clear idea of how he wants each work to look -
and that usually means simple and powerful.'
His controversial Munich production of Der fliegende Hollander, for example,
was set entirely within the walls of a bourgeois living room, like a
nightmare in familiar surroundings. His Basle Cos fan tutte resembled a Club
Mediterranean holiday island, where young love was superficial, blind and
promiscuous. His Salzburg Boris, in modern dress, used a stark, abstract
framework to make a bleak statement about the exercise of power.
All Wernicke's work has a political viewpoint - or, in his own words, 'a
socially critical message. You have to find new ways of interpreting old
pieces, of making them believable and relevant to society today. That
doesn't mean a singer should never stand still to sing an aria. Opera is a
law unto itself - it exists in a different time. You have to have the
courage to say: you, the singer, must sit and think about your situation.
That is your reality. As long as you're saying something about people and
not about stage conventions, it has its own legitimacy.'
Stage conventions are Wernicke's bete noir. Social conventions, on the other
hand, are the lifeblood of opera, giving Wernicke the key to works as
diverse as Die Fledermaus, Der Rosenkavalier and Carmen. 'You have to show
these conventions intelligently. I'm not a Brechtian - I don't believe in
pointing the finger. But you must make clear why you're doing the piece.
It's a permanent conflict: you want to leave room for entertainment, but at
the same time you have to make people think.'
So he has no intention of resorting to Spanish cliches when he stages Carmen
in Basle next month. There will be no flamenco costumes, no matadors (except
for Escamillo) - none of the fictional, folkloric Seville most people have
been taught to expect by big-house productions. In Wernicke's eyes, Bizet's
masterpiece is a tragic entertainment in the opera-comique tradition, with
spoken dialogue and a reduced orchestra.
Carmen, he says, is not a pouting sex-bomb, but 'an ideal which can never be
reached in bourgeois society - the representation of absolute freedom.
That's what fascinates Don Jose. She stands outside society, she is a threat
to petit-bourgeois values. She has to be flushed out of the system, because
she has something no-one else has. As in Don Giovanni, society learns
nothing - it breathes a sigh of relief when the 'evil' non-conformist has
been put away.'
Wernicke's ideal interpreter is someone who has never sung the role - or at
least has no preconceptions. 'I like singers to be curious. It doesn't
matter if they are good or bad actors - as long as they are willing to join
me on a voyage of discovery. I want to stretch them to their limits, so that
they make it as believable as they can. I don't demand the impossible, but
if a singer senses he or she can do something which was previously beyond
their capabilities, I've achieved something. With some it comes very
quickly, with others over a period of weeks, and with a few - never. A
beautiful voice on its own is never enough for the theatre.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sao Paulo shares pared losses to end off 2.1 per cent in heavy trade here as
a mild late buying spree was not enough to take the market into positive
territory.
The Bovespa index of the 55 most-actives shares fell for the fourth straight
day to close down 1,027 at 48,767 points. Turnover was RDollars 375.8m
(Dollars 445.7m).
Stocks have dropped 11.1 per cent since Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso became
president-elect in Monday's elections.
Analysts said prices dropped on concerns about possible government
restrictions on foreign funds entering Brazil combined with speculation
ahead of futures settlements.
Brokers said rumours that some small banks were facing financial
difficulties also weighed on prices.
Telebras TEL. SA preferred closed down 3.1 per cent at RDollars 45.50.

FT  08 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Delegates urged to remember
history
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Larry Whitty, party secretary, urged delegates to 'remember your
history'.
He said in his last speech to a party conference as general secretary:
'Remember the history of the broader Labour movement and the trade union
movement. Remember those people who through the bad years have voted for you
through bad times and through good.
'And remember that in progress in life and in politics you have to take the
people with you. And in that context let us always remember that the trade
union base of this party is its greatest strength and not its weakness.'
People did not join the party because of what was said at conference or
because of a slogan or a logo, said Mr Whitty. 'They join because they are
angry. They join because they want change. And we can redraft our aims and
constitutions as much as we like - and I believe we should. But the essence
of this party is that it stands for radical, redistributive change within
our society.'
He warned that the party and the unions had to move together 'otherwise we
fail together'.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Battle brewing over London radio
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A battle is brewing in the London radio market following the news that four
new commercial stations will come on air in the capital next year, including
a women's talk station, a Christian radio service and two rock music
stations.
The Radio Authority yesterday announced that it was also renewing the two
licences for the AM and FM popular music stations run by Capital Radio,
which may face fierce competition for its audience and advertising revenue
from the new rock stations run by the Virgin and Chrysalis entertainment
groups.
Mr Richard Eyre, Capital's managing director, said: 'Life is certainly going
to become more competitive. But we're looking forward to the fight.'
All four music stations have slightly different formats. Capital will
continue its youth-oriented AM service and 'golden oldie' Capital Gold
station. Chrysalis aims to attract a female audience for Crystal FM with
'soft rock' music from Phil Collins and Elton John. Virgin will target a
young, male audience by adding London talk shows to the 'hard rock' music
already played on its Virgin 1215 station.
Mr Richard Huntingford, chief executive of Chrysalis Radio, said he was
confident Crystal FM could carve out its own niche and that the new stations
would bring new advertising revenue into London radio.
Observers in the advertising industry were sceptical, however, that the
expanded London radio business could be financed entirely by new revenue.
Mr Adam Crozier, executive media director of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the UK
advertising agency, said: 'There's certainly scope to attract new money.
There may well be some redistribution of old money. It'll be up to each
station to compete on the quality of their output and marketing.'
Some radio executives privately criticised the Radio Authority which, they
said, had not fulfilled its statutory obligation to encourage diversity.
'There's been a clear change of policy,' said one. 'I don't think anyone
expected there to be four music stations in Greater London when they did
their business plans.'

FT  08 OCT 94 / US 'to use force' if Cedras stays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US will forcibly remove Haitian military leader Lieut-Gen Raoul Cedras
and members of his de facto government if they do not leave office by
October 15th, US government and military officials said yesterday, Reuter
reports.
Lieut-Gen Hugh Shelton, head of the US forces, said that Gen Cedras
'understands that as of the 15th he's out of here, and we'll be the ones to
push him out if he doesn't leave voluntarily.'
Senior US officials in Haiti also said President Emile Jonassaint and
ministers of his de facto government would also be removed by US troops if
they do not depart by that date.
Earlier US officials had assured Congress that they expected American forces
to leave Haiti by February 1996 at the latest.
'We fully expect that the entire operation in all of its phases will be over
by February 1996, which is the date specified in the relevant UN
resolution,' defence undersecretary Walter Slocombe told a hearing of the
House of Representatives armed services committee.
'We are very conscious of the risk of getting sucked into things that seem
like good ideas at the time that get us deeper and deeper in,' Mr Slocombe
said. 'And we are going to resist that temptation.'
The White House said President Clinton wanted to withdraw the US troops as
soon as possible, but was pleased Congress had not demanded it by a certain
date in a resolution passed on Thursday calling for a quick pullout.
'I think the president is obviously gratified that they did not include a
certain date for removing the troops,' White House press secretary Dee Dee
Myers said.
The Senate and House voted on Thursday to approve a non-binding resolution
urging a prompt, orderly pullout of US forces, but did not set a date. The
Senate resolution also chided the president for not seeking congressional
authorisation for the September 19 military intervention in Haiti.
Ms Myers said it was 'no secret' that many lawmakers had wanted Mr Clinton
to ask for congressional approval prior to the intervention, and that he had
a 'longstanding disagreement' with Capitol Hill on the subject.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Brazil's left-wing presidential candidate brushes off defeat
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, defeated in Brazil's presidential elections on
Monday, yesterday said his left-wing Workers Party (PT) had been
strengthened by the election and would continue its push for greater social
reforms.
'We may have lost the election, but we have not lost our task,' he said.
Mr da Silva appears to have been easily defeated in the presidential race by
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a former finance minister and social democrat
politician. With more than half the votes counted, Mr Cardoso has 54 per
cent compared to Mr da Silva's 26 per cent. Mr Cardoso claimed victory on
Thursday but Mr da Silva said he would not formally admit defeat until all
the votes are counted, not likely before next week.
Mr da Silva, a former metalworker who has helped turn the PT into Latin
America's biggest left-wing political party, said he had not yet decided
about his own future. This is his second defeat in presidential elections
and, although only 47, it is unclear whether he wants to compete again.
Despite Mr da Silva's defeat, the PT has done well in separate elections for
governors and Congress. The party is likely to elect its first state
governor in the state of Espirito Santo and the party's number of senators
could increase from 1 to at least 4.
Some politicians have called for a broad alliance of parties to support Mr
Cardoso and tackle Brazil's economic and social problems. But Mr da Silva
said he thought 'personally it is very difficult' for the PT to co-operate
since Mr Cardoso was already allied with right-wing forces opposed to the
PT.
The PT also called for a reform of the media, which strongly backed Mr
Cardoso. Mr da Silva said groups like Mr Roberto Marinho's Globo, which
controls Brazil's biggest TV broadcaster as well as newspapers and radio
stations, were too powerful.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Princess Di gazed into my eyes . . .: Peter Aspden describes
his intimate encounters with members of the royal family
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I crossed paths with the Princess of Wales a few weeks ago. It was in the
middle of the King's Road, broad daylight, not a detective to be seen. I
stared. I wish I could say, pace Pasternak and Hewitt, that I was aware of
her 'not in the gawping, let's assess-her-from-head-to-toe way, but with a
protective sense of excitement and relief', but I would be lying; I gawped,
I assessed, and my only sense of excited relief was that I wasn't her.
As she walked towards me on her way to take one of the little princes to a
movie, a strange feeling came over me; I felt embarrassed. I found myself
unable to carry on staring; it seemed indecent. While the caddish captain,
on his first meeting, 'drank in her effortlessness, her vibrant sheen and
the way she cupped hands', I could only look down in furtive discomfort.
Instead of our eyes meeting, it became a contest of who could bore the
deepest holes into the pavement. She probably won, having had more
experience, but I gave it all I had. I cursed that I did not have my camera
with me, but I could no more have sprung in front of her flashing lights in
her face than taken an axe to her neck screaming 'Viva la repubblica]'.
The whole affair lasted all of 30 seconds, but, just in case, publishers,
agents and great-nieces can get my number from the main FT switchboard. It
gave me a further, infinitesimal insight into life in the grotesque glare of
the royal spotlight. My shifty unease had come from the wish to dissociate
my rational judgment (she is an over-privileged, under-performing subject of
no interest whatsoever) from my quasi-prurient curiosity (exactly how
beautiful / thin / depressed is she?); it is, I believe, a battle that is
fought daily in the minds of newspaper readers of all hues as they struggle
to balance moral censoriousness with the frivolous lust for high-quality
gossip.
I should have learned my lesson some years ago, when I became, for a
mercifully short time and in the most half-hearted of ways, a member of the
royal rat-pack. I had been deputed by my local paper to cover Prince
Edward's activities at Cambridge University. I reported on his first rugby
match for his college ('a sinewy frame' I think I wrote), his first tutorial
(they surprisingly declined to invite us in) and, eventually, his stage
debut, in Arthur Miller's The Crucible.
After the performance (before a wonderfully bizarre mix of undergraduates
and Fleet Street's instant Miller experts), I was rung by a local radio
station; would I do a live interview? Inebriated by the absurdity of the
evening, I cheerfully agreed, and let rip. He was sim-ply won-derful, I
opined; prancing around in thigh-length leather boots, barking at underlings
as if he had been born to do so, magnetically dominating the proceedings
like a young Olivier.
My fine-spun and brutally sarcastic words were rammed down my throat the
next morning when my 'review' was broadcast nationally, on the hour, every
hour, over the whole of the next morning; for my sumptuously ironic tone was
lost completely. Friends called from all round the country, wondering why I
suddenly sounded like Barbara Cartland. I was humiliated.
The next time I encountered Edward was at a garden party, part of the usual
scrum of malingering press-hounds scrutinising his every move. Suddenly, he
bent down and picked up a small object. The cameras clicked as one. It was a
royal rota press pass, the one you need to get within a whiff of these
occasions. He smiled cruelly: 'Someone has been rather careless]', twiddling
the pass in his fingers while the pack laughed uneasily.
I looked downwards and froze. My lapel was naked. The pass was mine. I was
going to have to step forward, say sorry, bow in abject shame while every
photographer swooped on the heaven-sent headline opportunity: 'Please sir,
can I have my pass back?'; 'Who's a silly boy, then?'; 'The Prince and the
Plonker]' My life flashed before me. For the merest of seconds, I understood
what it was like to be him. I, however, had an extra option open to me - I
fled. No one took my picture, no one plastered me across every news-stand. I
escaped, the moment was forgotten.
All these memories flashed by as I read Princess in Love, the story that was
so beautiful, it had to be told, and as I read of Hewitt's plight ('The
world would judge him harshly in its ignorance, when all he was was a kind,
weak man who had done his very best'), I wondered if anyone knew the meaning
of shame any more.

FT  08 OCT 94 / As They Say in Europe: Trapped by special boring rights -
James Morgan recounts the horrors of an IMF conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the more intriguing problems confronted by any reporter is how to
tackle a story that is complex to the point of incomprehensibility and
arcane to the point of being meaningless.
How does one present a story, when one has never heard of the subject matter
and one's readers have not the slightest interest in it?
So it was with last Sunday's tale from Madrid of the collapse of various
detailed plans to launch an issue of the International Monetary Fund's
special drawing rights (SDRs).
Many who had assembled in the Spanish capital for the IMF and World Bank
annual meeting had dreaded the prospect of a row over SDRs. In the event,
there was not only a row but a split.
The fact that this arcane matter was linked with something called a
'systemic transformation facility' meant that many who had jumped the first
fence refused the second. Some even left town as their editors could
scarcely face filling their pages with such matters.
Those of us who stayed to cut our way through the unyielding rock of news
suffered many defeats. Spanish journalists were in a particularly
unfortunate position - they had nowhere to go because they could not ignore
the news that was taking place on their doorstep.
El Mundo, heroically, ran the headline: 'The Fund gets no agreement on the
widening of its capital.' Quite wrong, but a good try. In its hands, SDRs
became 'the nominal money of the IMF'. El Pais called SDRs 'credit
commitments' - but a typographical error made it 'cedit commitments', which
seemed quite interesting and very Castillian.
Elsewhere in Europe, opaque definitions ruled. For Le Monde, the phrase was
'reserve money of the Fund', while NRC-Handelsblad of Rotterdam used the
phrase 'Monopoly money'. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung dismissed SDRs,
sniffily, as 'money out of thin air'.
So it was that Europe's top economic writers turned quickly from the tedious
details of the row to a much more profitable field: who to blame for the
ghastly debacle. The problem was eased because there were so many
candidates.
The IMF's boss, Michel Camdessus, had put up the original plan for SDR
distribution, which had the firm support of developing countries. But the
British and Americans cut the proposed amount in half and said it should go
mostly to their friends in the old Soviet Union.
The Germans were grudging even about this. The French, however, like the
idea of free money for everyone; it was not surprising that Le Monde blamed
the G-7 and its 'sin of pride' in refusing to compromise further.
So, in Germany, Handelsblatt made something of the typical French generosity
with other people's money. The man from the Dutch Handelsblad thought that
weak leadership in both organisations had combined with the 'new
self-confidence of the developing countries'. The FAZ, of course, blamed
everybody. The Neue Zurcher Zeitung noted, happily, that there had been 'no
winners, only losers'.
I blamed Spain. It provides a suitable stage for the theatre of disaster
and, after all, the country has a proverb which runs: 'A rio revuelto
ganancia de pescadores' - troubled waters are the fisherman's gain.
Troubled waters dominated. The press corps gloomily contemplated the
recently privatised telephone system and was amazed to hear how much it had
improved. Only the Italians felt at home, but even they admitted that the
interface between Telecom Italia and Telefonica did provide some nasty
surprises.
The trouble with Spain is that, barring bloodshed, revolution and civil war,
not much happened there between around 1770 and 1970. A whole epoch of
development was missed. Thus, there is scarcely a hotel room which has a
radio, although all have television sets.
Then there is the curious phenomenon of clocklessness. Northern Europe
abounds with clock towers, cuckoo clocks or whatever. In France, there are
few; in Spain, there are hi-tech digital items on streets but none in the
hotel rooms. A jet-lagged colleague from New York rang reception in the
early hours to say he wanted a clock. He was advised to tune into the French
television channel where he would see the time 24 hours a day.
Then there was the television producer who also rang reception to ask how
she should operate the air-conditioning. 'Open the window,' came the reply.
Spain is not at its best when it is trying to be a modern, sophisticated
industrial state. Madrid still provides the best of old Spanish customs:
marvellous, efficient bars and restaurants. Helpful, honest taxi drivers.
It also understands realities that others miss. A cartoon in El Pais on the
IMF and Bank meetings asked: 'If all goes well for the economy, what matters
if it doesn't for the people in it?'

FT  08 OCT 94 / Private View: Post-mortem on a bloody century
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wise old owl or vengeful vulture? From his perch at the top of the tree,
Eric Hobsbawm, the eminent historian and life-long communist, has looked
down on the dying carcass of our century and given his verdict.
He has broken a self-imposed rule in order to write the history of an era -
his own - which started and ended symbolically at Sarajevo. In doing so, he
is inviting not only the critical judgment of his peers but the derision of
his political opponents.
Professor Hobsbawm may be a bird of ill omen but his book Age of Extremes,
to be published in three weeks, cannot fail to make an impact at this
anxious end of the millennium. It is a panoptic post-mortem of the 'short'
20th century from the outbreak of the first world war to the death of
communism, and a sequel to his trilogy covering the 'long' 19th century from
the French Revolution to 1914.
Hobsbawm himself was born a few months before Lenin's October Revolution.
The son of a British father and Austrian mother, he grew up in Vienna and
Berlin before moving to England. His name ('it is more systematically
mis-spelt than any other') seems to be a corruption of 'Obstbaum' or 'fruit
tree'.
His political creed is the product of his (non-religious) Jewish descent and
of a day in 1933 when, walking home from school in Berlin with his sister,
he learned that Hitler had come to power.
Age of Extremes is elegantly written, a synthesis stuffed with supporting
fact, a dazzling survey taking in everything from particle physics to
post-modernist art, from collective farms to supermarket check-outs.
It sees the century as a triptych. The first panel depicts a 32-year-long
barbaric war punctuated by a slump. The second shows a Golden Age, a 30-year
world economic boom engineered out of the preceding catastrophe and
guaranteed by nuclear stalemate, a period when human society was utterly
transformed.
In the third, all is confusion - a landslide of technological advance
accompanied by social decay, and the emergence of global forces (financial,
demographic, environmental) which democratic governments seem powerless to
manage or control.
Hobsbawm is an historian of international repute, translated and read widely
outside his own land. At home, he is better known for his
'semi-professional' work as a political analyst and his status as guru to
the British left wing. His views hindered his promotion at Cambridge, where
he was a fellow of King's, and he had his first book turned down on grounds
of bias.
I met the gaunt intellectual in his study at Hampstead, north London, a room
betraying the eclectic mind of a man who collects Moghul miniatures and is
also a jazz critic (writing under the name Francis Newton). He discoursed
eloquently on the uses of history in our dangerously forgetful age, and the
abuses of history by the separatists and nationalists who proliferate in the
new world disorder.
But now that the academic historian and veteran Marxist have fused, as it
were, the first question readers will ask is why they should trust his
perspective on the century.
'I stuck to the 19th century for a long time,' Hobsbawm said, 'because for a
Marxist - and certainly for a communist - writing anything to do with the
Soviet Union after 1917 could not conceivably be done without saying things
you knew weren't true. At least, I could have done so as a communist but I
would have got into a lot more trouble. So I would say, keep your nose out.'
He laughed, lugubriously.
Why do you say you would have had to write things which weren't true?
'Well, the official line, as it were, on the Russian revolution was either
that Trotsky didn't exist or that he was a member of the British secret
service from 1918. There's no way you can do any history that way.'
How could you belong to a party which promulgated untruths when you knew
them to be untruths?
'Well,' he sighed, with the air of one confronting the inevitable. 'Do you
think you choose your parties purely by the official statements made by your
leaders? These official statements shouldn't actually be binding on other
people. But . . .'
You mean you choose your party as you might choose your church?
'You choose a package deal. Bits of the package aren't what you would have
chosen.'
Was being a communist for you a rational, or an emotional thing?
'Oh, no. I mean from the start it was obviously an emotional and profoundly
felt conviction. You felt that the world was going to hell and you felt that
world revolution would be the only way of saving it. And you may understand
that if you were a teenager in Berlin during the rise of Hitler.
'It wasn't a rational decision to begin with. But it gave me an initial
interest in history. One of my schoolmasters said: 'You call yourself a
communist, but evidently you don't know anything about it. Kindly go to the
school library and read up the communist manifesto and one or two other
things and see what you come back with.'
'From that stage, it became much more rational. But the commitment wasn't
rational. The commitment was . . . I would almost say religious.'
I said: A man will ignore things he knows to be lies for the sake of loyalty
. . .
'For the sake of loyalty, or for the sake of, if you like, a larger good.
But I mean everyone does this to some extent if they choose a cause or have
a cause chosen for them. All my friends working in Bletchley (the
code-breaking station in England in the second world war) kept silent for 30
years, even though they knew stuff was being said that was not so.'
Did you feel - do you feel - a conflict between your professional life and
your political adherence, which involved swallowing a certain amount of
rubbish?
'I certainly felt there was a conflict, yes. I did my level best never to
actually write stuff myself which I didn't believe in and which spoke lies.
There was a conflict, but it didn't affect the things that I wrote about.
'Incidentally, if I may say so, none of this fooled the Russians. Not a
single one of my books was ever published in Russia in the Soviet period.
Not a single one . . . huh?' He gave an interrogatory grunt. 'In Hungary,
yes. In Slovenia, yes. You were supposed to write a straightforward line,
and whatever I said did not fit in.'
What do you call yourself today, politically?
'I'm on the left and I continue to be profoundly sceptical of capitalism as
a system for solving the problems of the world.'
I asked what it meant to be a 'Marxist historian'.
Hobsbawm said he believed the best way to tackle history was still to study
the way human beings collectively earn their living, to understand the
social structures and institutions they develop. 'Indeed, far more people
today, historians of any kind, use this method without being aware of it
than did when I was a student.'
It doesn't imply a bias that will infect your writing of history?
'It needn't particularly. In the past, a lot of Marxists were also committed
to particular, demanding political organisations. I don't think it's an
essential part of the exercise. It would be theoretically possible to make a
Marxist analysis and not even be socialist.'
Are all historians to be found somewhere on the political spectrum?
'Yes. All serious ones. Unless you are simply a chronicler or compiler of
dictionaries.'
So the truth will always be to some extent a function of feelings?
'It would be affected by this, yes. And, to this extent, it is impossible to
say that what we are coming up with is The Truth.
'It's perfectly possible, for instance, that a historian in 50 years' time
will look back and see that the dichotomy under which we have all been
operating - a capitalist or a socialist type of economy - is simply a
function of the war of religion waged in the 20th century and that it would
make at least as much sense to distinguish four, five or six different
types.'
Truths and facts are not the same thing?
'Truths and facts are not the same thing. I think it is absolutely essential
that historians should not go against what can be proved or disproved by
evidence. The point is, there are limits to evidence. Either Elvis Presley
is dead or he is not . . . what?
'Our own concepts and the way of putting them together don't have the same
validity as the facts themselves, the verifiable or falsifiable data. It
depend on the questions we ask. Nonetheless - and there is today an enormous
consensus among professional historians - one must be against the kind of
post-modernist relativism that is going around various parts of the literary
and social sciences.
'If there is fiction in history, it is a fiction which is based on fact. It
is, if you like, art made up of objets trouves, but the objets have got to
be real objects and not inventions.'
Hobsbawm has said that most of his conscious life has been devoted to a hope
which, plainly, has been disappointed and to a cause which, plainly, has
failed. Talking about his book in a lecture at the University of London,
where he is emeritus professor of economic and social history, he said:
'There is nothing which can sharpen the historian's mind like defeat.'
He went on: 'As the century ends, the world is fuller of defeated thinkers
wearing a very wide variety of ideological badges than of triumphant ones.
Especially among those old enough to have long memories.'
Hobsbawm has the memories, all right. He has certainly suffered the defeats.
But if his foresight was poor - and whose was any better? - his hindsight,
it must be said, is terrific.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Motoring: Future takes the stand, but will it hit the road?
/ A look at all the prototypes, dotty and practical, at the Paris motor show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is the star of the Paris Mondial de l'automobile that opened this week?
Is it an exciting but dotty Renault Espace incorporating a lot of Formula 1
racing car parts and claimed to be the world's fastest four-seater? Or is it
Xanae, a concept car described by its builder, Citroen, as 'a house on
wheels'?
The 186 mph / 300 kph Espace F1 has a mid-mounted Renault V10 engine from
the 1992 and 1993 World Championship winners, a semi-automatic six-speed
gearbox and Williams racing car rear suspension.
Renault says, tongue in cheek, that this first F1 four-seater offers a
'never to be forgotten motoring sensation'. I am sure it does on a race
track. One hopes that no one is ever tempted to stretch its legs on a public
road.
Unlike so many concept cars which burst upon the motor show scene like
comets and then disappear just as quickly, Citroen's Xanae (you say
Zan-eye-eh) is a practical running prototype. It has the same chassis
platform, 2.0-litre, 16-valve petrol engine and automatic transmission as a
Citroen Xantia. The suspension incorporates the active roll limitation
system that impressed me so much when I tried it a few weeks ago (this
column, 24 September).
If the mechanicals are more conventional than state of the art, the body
bristles with bright ideas. Although at 423 cm (almost 14 ft) overall the
Xanae is shorter than a Xantia and only a little longer than a ZX, up to
five people find it spectacularly roomy inside.
The floor is completely flat and the body pillarless. When a front door and
rear-hinged back door are opened, nothing obstructs people getting in and
out. The minor controls are in a height-adjustable cluster on the steering
column.
A windscreen as steeply slanted as that of a French TGV train extends into a
transparent roof panel. Xanae would not, as one might suppose, become
insufferably hot on a sunny day because the glass is heat reflective and air
conditioning is standard.
Citroen side-steps questions on whether Xanae will evolve into a production
vehicle, saying it was created to test public reaction to new vehicle
concepts.
Elsewhere in the show there are four MPVs (multi-purpose vehicles), jointly
developed with Fiat and made by PSA (Peugeot-Citroen Group). These MPVs are
sold, badged as Citroens, Fiats, Peugeots and Lancias, as 'monobox'
alternatives to normal large estate cars.
In three or four years, I could see a car based on Xanae fitting nicely into
the PSA product range below these MPVs and above the Citroen Xantia and
Peugeot 306.
The only obvious drawback to Xanae is an intimidatingly high sill that would
put the roomy but deep boot out of bounds to anyone who has a bad back - or
is afraid of getting one.
Ford is also showing a concept car based on an up to seven-seat MPV it has
jointly developed with Volkswagen and which goes on sale next Spring.
Zero emission vehicles are due to appear soon in Californian showrooms to
satisfy environmental protection legislation. Things have not gone that far
in Europe. But even here the battery-electric car is moving from the
impractical novelty stage into small-scale production. It will, though, be
some time before they are sold in dealerships alongside petrol and diesel
cars.
At the Paris show, Peugeot has unveiled Ion, a 3.32 metre (130.7 inch) long,
four-seat battery-electric concept it thinks might be the ideal urban
runabout of 2000. Like the Peugeot 106 and Citroen AX electric cars now
being evaluated on a large scale in France, Ion has a nickel-cadmium battery
pack giving it a range of up to 150 km (93 miles). Peugeot says Ion is only
an exploratory project, but concedes that some of its interior and exterior
styling ideas will be incorporated in a future town car.
Britons may get a chance of seeing Peugeot's Ion at the UK's International
Motor Show in Birmingham later this month.
Among cars being unveiled to the public at Paris are a stunning Alfa Romeo
GTV Spider (successor to the car immortalised by Dustin Hoffman in The
Graduate) and the new Jaguar XJ saloons and their high-off-the-ground,
four-wheel driven counterparts, the luxurious new Range Rovers. Aston Martin
has the first of its ravishing DB7s due to be delivered to a French buyer as
the centerpiece of its stand.
Nissan and Honda are making a splash with their new QX 2.0-litre and
3.0-litre V6-engined executive saloons and Civic five-door hatchbacks
respectively. Ford's odd looking Scorpio replacement is there, as are two
desirable Porsches - a new 911 Carrera 4 with all-wheel drive and a
rear-wheel drive 911 with gear selection for its Tiptronic transmission by
thumb button on the steering wheel.
Mondial de l'Automobile at the Porte de Versailles exhibition complex is
open until 16 October.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Sport: In a giant's footsteps - Simon Hughes treads
carefully as he follows Ian Botham down the road - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What, people ask, is Ian Botham up to these days? Here is a quick resume. He
is trudging around the west coast of Britain for a month raising funds for
leukaemia research. He will let the blisters calm down for a week, then he
is off to Australia and New Zealand to promote his book, My Autobiography,
before appearing alongside Rolf Harris in pantomime at Wimbledon. He will
play one of Baron Hardup's men in Cinderella. Then he will change into his
favourite jeans and T-shirt for a speaking tour of various countries with
Allan Lamb. Then it will be summer again. 'Basically there's not a spare day
in the diary until about June,' he said.
But then Botham would not be Botham without activity (his name has even been
used as an eponym - viz 'I was so angry I went totally Botham') and he needs
people around him; on the cricket field, by the river bank, on the B-roads
of north Wales where I joined him last week. Even in the middle of the night
he likes company.
Once, when we were both playing for Durham we were staying in a Nottingham
hotel. I was asleep in a single room - a luxury on county cricket's
relentless circuit. At 2am the phone went.
'Hi Yozzer, it's Beefy. Fancy some Burgundy in my room?'
'But it's the middle of the night,' I complained.
'I'm in the next room,' he replied. 'If you don't turn up I'll kick your
door in.'
So I did as I was told, and sat bleary-eyed, sipping and nodding for an hour
or so while he held court and demolished two bottles.
It has been said that Botham is either your best friend or your worst enemy,
and that really is the gist of it. There are no grey areas - things are
either black or white. Be loyal to him and he will be loyal to you, but
tread on his toes and he will stamp on your head.
I was very careful of his feet last Wednesday. They are doing nearly 5 mph
for 22 days as he wends his way round the British coast from Liverpool to
Somerset and one frightening sore - about the size of a bath plug - had
formed on his right heel. This is hardly surprising considering the speed he
walks and the number of paces a day - about 36,000 by my calculation. (Two
years ago Gary Lineker walked with him but could not keep up. Footballers
are, of course, only used to 90 minutes' exercise at a time.)
During the course of this, his seventh trek round the towns and villages of
his homeland, Botham completed 3,000 miles and passed the Pounds 3m figure
for sums raised on behalf of leukaemia research. Why does he do it? Heroism,
insanity and compassion might be a reasonable summation.
He loves the adulation from the public - the blue-rinsed old ladies, the
housewives in bare feet, the classes of schoolchildren cheering at the side
of the road - and they love to idolise him even if they fail to identify
him. 'Which one is he?' cried a woman in the doorway of a hairdresser's as
the caravan of tracksuited figures marched past.
Botham's support cast of dedicated volunteers ensures the success of the
campaign. Two friends set up a stall to sell merchandise ahead of the party,
while Gerry, his father-in-law, announces that 'the greatest sportsman in
the world will be passing in five minutes' over a loudspeaker.
Mike Gatting is accompanying Botham for two weeks and takes on the task of
directing the traffic that builds up behind the entourage. At dinner that
evening, he is fined 50p for impersonating a policeman.
Other helpers dish out food at regular intervals (there is no stopping even
to sign autographs until the day's destination is reached). People with
buckets rush about collecting loose change from pedestrians and motorists
and a mobile bank follows behind to stash away the takings of about Pounds
9,000 a day.
Botham's wife, Kath, beavers away ensuring everything runs smoothly. She is
the only person who really knows him; his one true, totally forgiving
friend.
Over-zealous women almost swoon as he passes, others rush up wailing 'Oooh,
I'll give a fiver for a kiss.' Journalists who privately ridicule him dare
not do so in print. If you make fun of his portly appearance or poor
timekeeping, he returns it with interest. Any mockery is repelled with the
usual 'well, how many test wickets did you take then?' He enjoys the banter
and he rarely comes second.
Underneath the incredible hulk, with calves the width of sewage pipes, there
is genuine humility. On the walk he looks after ailing colleagues and makes
good-natured sounds and motions whenever someone drops money in the bucket,
no matter how much.
His autobiography, a best-seller, contains laborious accounts of test series
with precious little insight - it is a feature of great sportsmen that they
have poor recall of momentous achievements. But among the chaff there are
touching, emotional passages about his family and friends, and the remorse
he feels for everything he has thrown at his wife, mentally and physically.
How has their marriage withstood those 20 years of trial and torment?
'The answer is: it's all down to Kath,' he admits.
The public support he receives on his travels underlines the fact that he is
truly a people's hero. To them, his mistakes, his relatively humble
background, his occasionally misdirected impulses make him seem more human,
and therefore more likeable than a Nick Faldo or a Nigel Mansell.
Some elements of the press seem him in a different light, and write things
that sometimes turn him purple with rage. At such times he would be wise to
remember the words of Dr Johnson: 'A fly sir, may sting a stately horse and
make him wince. But one is but an insect, the other a horse still.'

FT  08 OCT 94 / Sport: Return of the missing links - Derek Lawrenson visits
two great courses which fell on hard times / Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK LAWRENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Temporary greens and Astroturf are the sorts of things that municipal
golfers reluctantly accept as being part of the territory. The last place
one would expect to find either inconvenience would be at two of the UK's
great links courses. Yet the former has been part of life at Royal Birkdale
for the past three years, while members of Carnoustie have become acquainted
with the latter.
Both clubs have had to take such measures to overcome a loss of prestige. At
Birkdale, near Southport, on Merseyside, a problem with the greens came to a
head at the 1991 Open when millions of viewers watched the world's top
golfers putting on surfaces the colour of Ryvita. Several players thought
they were about as smooth as Ryvita too.
'If you want consistent greens you'll have to dig them up and start again,'
Payne Stewart said.
At Carnoustie, some 30 miles north of St Andrews, on a harsh and exposed
piece of land hard against the North Sea, the course, under the stewardship
of the local district council, had fallen into a sad state of neglect. It
used to be said that St Andrews, on the edge of the old university town, had
the setting and Carnoustie, bordered by a whiskey distillery and a large
council building, the golf course, but the great links at Carnoustie came to
match their run-down location.
Things have improved at both courses. Birkdale took Stewart's advice, which
is why the members have been putting on temporary greens for three years.
At Carnoustie, the council head-hunted the St Andrews greenkeeper, John
Philp, and gave him money to spend and a free hand to improve matters. The
result is that Carnoustie will host next year's Scottish Open and the Open,
for the first time in 24 years, in 1999. The course is in such good
condition that it puts a certain place down the road, the venue for this
week's Dunhill Cup, to shame.
The members have even grown used to carrying a piece of Astroturf round with
them from November to March. To protect the fairways, they place their ball
on the artificial turf.
'There is just no growth up here in the winter,' Earle Smith, the secretary,
said. 'A lot of members were unhappy at first but when they saw how good the
fairways looked in March they did not mind so much.'
Indeed the powers at St Andrews were sufficiently impressed to adopt a
similar policy this winter on the Old Course, where the fairways are in a
poor state.
The Open returns to Birkdale in 1998, when the players will find putting
surfaces quite different to those they experienced in 1991.
'The problem was caused by the residue of incorrect top dressing materials
used over a period of time,' said Norman Crewe, secretary. This had caused a
black layer to form under the surface which choked off the roots and
prevented any consistent growth. The club consulted many experts. Arnold
Palmer, the club's honorary president, even sent over his senior agronomist.
The cure involved peeling back the putting surface and digging out the black
layer. With the greens out of action anyway, the club took the opportunity
to change their character as well.
Crewe said: 'Some of them were really nothing more than tough pieces of land
at the end of the fairways. So now we've added some contours to some of the
flatter ones to make it more aesthetically pleasing and obviously harder on
which to hole putts.'
The difference is instantly obvious on greens such as the par-three seventh,
which used to be shaped like a saucer, so a player could invariably get away
with a poorly-struck shot. Now the green is more like an upturned saucer and
so sheds such a stroke rather than gathering it in.
The work on all 18 greens, at a cost of Pounds 270,000, was completed last
winter and after one growing season they are still not perfect. 'We're
quietly confident we've got it right,' Crewe said.
'All the work practically cleaned us out. Now we have to build up the
reserves again,' he said. There is little question the visitors who stayed
away while the root construction work was being carried out will return.
Green fees may be Pounds 50 but there are not many better places to play
golf.
The same, of course, can be said of Carnoustie, although it would be nice if
one of the many grand plans to do something about the setting finally came
to fruition. Will someone not rid us of the abominable council building that
stands where a clubhouse normally does and serves little purpose?
Unlike Birkdale, the club had no need of large-scale alterations. If
necessary Carnoustie can be stretched to 7,400 yards, although on a cold,
bleak October day last week, it was more than daunting at 500 yards short of
that.
At the turn of the last century the great players that a great links so
often produces left Carnoustie, headed west for America and played a part in
the development of the game there. Two brothers, Willie and Alex Smith, won
the US Open, while Stewart Maiden taught the game to Bobby Jones, who many
believed to be the greatest of all players.
As we approach the end of this century, it is the turn of the great players
to come back to Carnoustie. What a treat lies in store for those who,
because of its years of enforced absence, have not seen the course.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Books: Diarist with a dramatist's ear - JDF Jones on Alan
Bennett, 30 years on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JDF JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WRITING HOME by Alan Bennett Faber Pounds 17.50, 417 pages
Alan Bennett must be chuffed to read his publisher's announcement on the
jacket of Writing Home that he is 'one of Britain's best-loved writers'.
From Beyond The Fringe to National Treasure in 30 years] The journey from a
Leeds butcher's shop to the trendiest intellectuals' street in London surely
goes to prove what a splendid, upwardly-mobile country this can be.
'Best-loved'? Oh dear . . .
It helps, of course, if you have a wonderful talent to go with the sort of
determination and sheer hard work that you cannot quite hide beneath the
timid, cardiganed image. Bennett, now an unbelievable 60, is a great wit and
a playwright and a performer and a diarist, working in theatre, television
and print with almost equal skill, and he deserves every bit of his
celebrity (not to mention Britain's love).
Writing Home is a compendium. It contains a selection from his diaries of
the 1980s, repeats of his pieces in the London Review of Books (most
famously The Lady in the Van, his memoir of nutty Miss Shepherd, whom he
allowed to park in his garden for 15 years), and odds and sods of
journalism, scripts, reviews, plus one-off appearances like his brave speech
at the memorial service for his friend Russell Harty.
Because much of Writing Home has already appeared in print elsewhere, most
attention is going to be paid to the extracts from the diaries. Bennett has
been keeping a regular if not daily journal for 25 years, of course; these
pages from 1980 are no more than a careful selection. The extracts are
invariably either very quotable or very funny, and often both - they are the
sort of thing you are constantly tempted to read out to your companion - but
I cannot help feeling that published diaries need to be complete, or at
least much fuller than this, to achieve their full impact.
It used to be rumoured in NW1 that the Bennett diaries would eventually be
published posthumously and in full, in all their embarrassment and delight:
Faber might remember that. This is, of course, just one way of my saying
that we would like more of the same.
What we have on display here, not just in the diaries, are, first, a
constant and magnificent wit (asked by the BBC for a comment on Pinter's
50th birthday, he thought, too late, of proposing a two-minute silence; Lady
Ottoline Morrell is described as 'well-to-do and six foot two'; of Philip
Larkin, 'Schweitzer in the Congo did not derive more credit than Larkin did
for living in Hull').
Second, there is the English class thing, which includes nostalgia,
nervousness, a sense of deprivation ('Class isn't what it was; or nowadays
perhaps people's embarrassments are differently located'). There goes with
this the gift of a particular detailed memory - see his recollection of the
childhood experience of a Leeds tram ride. And for Bennett, timidity
apparently goes with apprehension, sometimes expressed with alarming
candour: 'My nightmare when blackberrying (or when I stop the car for a pee)
is that I shall find the body of a child, that I will report it, and be
suspected of the crime'. Behind all this there is an instinctive radicalism.
The Gibraltar shootings and the Falklands war figure largely in the diaries:
he knows, and explains, how, why, he hates, loves, England.
Always, there is the dramatist's ear for quotation: 'I am having supper at
the Odeon (New York) when word goes round the tables that John Lennon has
been shot. 'This country of ours,' sighs my waiter. 'May I tell you the
specials for this evening?'' The dramatist moves, inevitably if
incongruously, among the good and the great - 'Supper with the Waltons and
Russell Harty. Wm Walton has asked me to write a companion piece for his
one-act opera The Bear . . .' More interesting, on a later occasion, 'Liz
Taylor perched momentarily on my knee (and pretty uncomfortable it was
too).'
The serious point Bennett makes in his Introduction is to describe a tension
between what he calls the metropolitan and the provincial modes in his
writing; he puts this, rather movingly, in an anecdote of an absurd
encounter in a Leeds street between his mother and TS Eliot (she is later
told by her son of the Nobel Prize - 'I'm not surprised. It was a beautiful
overcoat'.)
He seems to think that he has not yet closed the gap between his provincial
(ie northern) and his metropolitan voices. I think he is wrong, and that if
he never wrote another word, after Forty Years On, An Englishman Abroad, A
Question of Attribution, Talking Heads, The Madness of George III, and all
the rest, not forgetting his original creation of Mark Boxer's The
Stringalongs, he would be remembered as one of the very few writers who
spoke for our mixed-up generation. He practises compassion as well as wit.
Like this. His mother had Alzheimer's towards the end; he would visit her in
Weston-super-Mare. 'There are sheep in the field. 'I know what they are,'
she says, 'but I don't know what they are called.' Thus Wittgenstein is
routed by my mother.' Wonderful.

the reminiscences of a witty man doomed to rejection by the party leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CLARK

<TEXT>
A BAG OF BOILED SWEETS by Julian Critchley Faber Pounds 17.50, 256 pages
Julian Critchley was in Parliament for a very long time. He watched the Tory
party change (the euphemism is 'adapt') and did not much like what he saw.
So for historians he is a valuable source. We enjoy the bonus of his
literary style and his powers of observation: there (in 1962) is the prime
minister 'who would attend upon the '22 (Committee) with difficulty,
nervously fingering his Brigade tie'. But 20 years later it was 'pull up our
socks' and 'we've got work to do'.
As a diarist, an impressionist really, the author has this delightful light
touch which, like a watercolour by Cezanne, is so delicate in its use of
colour as to please the connoisseur but leave (perhaps) the philistine
puzzled or impatient. (This was also true of much of the way Critchley
commented and conducted himself in Parliament, I may say.) Take this
introduction to a visit to Harold Macmillan: '. . . Birch Grove, a modern
country house the back of which abuts on the Bluebell Line, a preserved
steam railway often to be glimpsed on television.'
Future students will be able to write a whole doctoral thesis on Critchley's
economy of language, and the gentle tone of mockery which pervades his
treatment of even the most sententious topics.
Here he is on one of the 'safest' bits of his own constituency: 'Fleet, a
curiously dull early 20th-century planned town where retired Colonels and
their ladies hang like an army of bats in the mouth of some Goanese cave.'
At one point the author falls foul of Lord Grimston, a nonentity who chaired
the Carlton Club (foolishly and youthfully Critchley had entertained Jo
Grimond to lunch there). Critchley was summoned to apologise and an
appointment was agreed. A Lucky Jim sequence followed. Pouring rain, no
taxis, no buses, no (after some hour and a half) Critchley. A cross note
from Grimston awaited him when finally he turned up. But the episode is
neither enlarged on nor subsequently referred to until much later. Critchley
(at that time pretty broke, no longer an MP and now writing about wine)
brings into the club as a guest Cyril Ray, a tiny left-wing twerp who also
postured as a wine buff: '. . . luckily there was no sign of Lord Grimston'.
Rancour, that chemical inseparable from the human condition, especially when
in introspective 'mode', is almost entirely absent. Only two colleagues are
categorised as 'nasty bits of work'. George Wigg, who undoubtedly was one,
and the hapless Robin Maxwell-Hyslop (whom I always found eccentric and
combative but, nonetheless 'a good sort'). Michael Heseltine, whom poor
Critchley was deluded into thinking of as his 'best friend' (there is a
revealing description of Critchley being slowly frozen out from both the
house which they shared and the job to which Heseltine had appointed him) is
confirmed as callous and single-minded but (my interpretation) so
obsessionally egocentric that even the Tory Party, when it came down to it,
would do anything to avoid having him as leader.
There is a profusion of anecdote. Some, many, we have heard before, but they
continue to give pleasure being literarily Homeric. They have entered into
myth, and enjoy continuing and adaptive embellishment.
One omitted, and worth recounting because it may illuminate his 'difficult'
relationship with the then prime minister, is from a dinner held in 1988.
There is a photograph in the book which the author has pleasingly and
characteristically captioned 'the remnants of the 1959 intake ('quite . . .
the worst of my experience' - RA Butler). The woman in the middle is Mrs
Thatcher.' At the conclusion of this meal Julian had the trickyish task of
introducing the prime minister. 'Margaret, what can I say about you that has
not been said already?'
Acknowledging this, in that special sugary tone which she reserved for those
whom she disliked, the prime minister opened: 'Julian, what can I say about
you which you haven't said already?'
And I suppose that much of this delightful book has, by the author himself,
been 'said already.' But it is lovely to have it all under one cover; the
testament of a clever, witty man who loved politics but was doomed to
rejection. Critchley mourns the transition of his party from Knights of the
Shires to Estate Agents and Motor Dealers. But reading him carefully will
reveal that the author was too fastidious for acceptance by either.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Books: Leviathan of the 17th century - AC Grayling hails the
writings of Hobbes; philosopher, scientist - and chrysanthemum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AC GRAYLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THOMAS HOBBES: VOLUMES I AND II edited by Noel Malcolm
Oxford University Press Pounds 120, 1008 pages
A Chinese saying tells us that 'orchids fear the Taylor-bird's song, but
chrysanthemums survive autumn's frosts'; which means that early developers
fade early whereas late developers go from strength to strength. This is an
optimistic saying; there is hope for us all yet.
Hobbes was a chrysanthemum. At the age of 46 he fell in love with geometry,
and suddenly blossomed into an intellectual giant; despite Parkinson's
disease later, and perhaps because he sang to himself every night as a way
of keeping fit (he said it cleared his lungs), he lived to the grand age of
92, producing scientific, mathematical and philosophical works which had a
profound influence upon the birth of modern times.
These two volumes constitute the first collection of Hobbes's known
correspondence, and their publication is therefore an important literary and
philosophical event. There are letters here between Hobbes and - among many
others - Pierre Gassendi, John Aubrey, Marin Mersenne, Gottfried Leibniz,
Cosimo de Medici, and King Charles II, whose mathematics tutor Hobbes had
been. Almost half have not previously been published. They open a window
onto many aspects of the 17th-century world; anyone interested in history,
literature, politics, philosophy and the history of science will find them
utterly absorbing.
The editor of these handsome volumes is a man whom Hobbes and his
correspondents would have recognised as someone of their own stamp: a fine
scholar who nevertheless engages with the world outside the academy. Noel
Malcolm, political correspondent on the Daily Telegraph and sometime Fellow
of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, has done an outstanding job of
translating all the Latin, Greek, French and Italian in the correspondence,
providing excellent introductory material and biographical notices of
Hobbes's correspondents. A reading of the letters and this elegantly written
apparatus amounts to an education in the history of 17th century thought.
Hobbes's most famous work is unquestionably the Leviathan, his great
treatise of political philosophy. This work, together with the scientific
and psychological theories he developed in connection with it, made him
celebrated throughout continental Europe, but a figure of obloquy in his own
country - partly because of the virulent anti-clericalism of his ideas,
which made him seem an atheist, but also because the conclusion of his
political theory is an uncomfortable one; namely, that the best form of
government is absolute rule by a single sovereign power.
Hobbes based this theory on his view of human nature, of which he took a
deeply pessimistic view. Humans, he said, are greedy, selfish and
distrustful, and will prey upon one another unless they are restrained by
fear of a coercive power. Civil society comes into existence to give people
protection against each other; each individual yields up, by consent, some
of his liberty in return for security. But the logical terminus of this,
Hobbes argued, is that full security is best achieved if there is a single
absolute sovereign exercising power over all. The sovereign power might be a
collective body, like parliament, or a monarch. Hobbes preferred the latter,
on the grounds that a monarch will not be weakened by internal divisions, as
might happen in a collective body.
By postulating human nature rather than religion or tradition as the ground
of civil society, Hobbes thought he had moved political theory into the
realms of science. His ideas provoked strong resistance in many quarters,
but his methods proved influential; his reliance on reason and experience
helped to free subsequent philosophy from its thraldom to scholasticism and
theology.
It is one of the oddities of national temperament that whereas Hobbes's
continental friends - many of whom, like Gassendi, were priests - were
tolerant towards his attacks on religion, in England his views were regarded
with horror. In 1666, after the plague and Fire of London, people began
looking for reasons why God was punishing England, and a flurry of
heretic-hunting began. A parliamentary committee considered a bill 'against
Atheisme Blasphemy or Prophaneness . . . And in perticular . . . the booke
of Mr Hobbes called the Leviathan'. Hobbes was saved from this threat,
probably by Charles II, who was fond of him; but his reputation as a
maverick remained.
Interest in Hobbes has been steadily reviving in recent years, and Malcolm's
magnificent edition of his correspondence will help to spur that process. No
one has to agree with Hobbes to appreciate his achievement; failure to
understand this fact is one of the reasons why England is often so slow to
applaud its own.

DIVIDED WE FALL: GAMBLING WITH HISTORY IN THE NINETIES by Haynes Johnson WW
Norton Pounds 19.95, 431 pages
The best way to find out what people are thinking is to go out and ask them.
Haynes Johnson, a journalist on the Washington Post, has applied this simple
maxim - too often forgotten by those who work in the metropolis - to build
up his portrait of an America bewildered by decline and wracked by
pre-millennial tensions.
His wide-angle lens captures a middle class defending past gains behind
security gates while city services and schools collapse, medical costs soar,
crime, guns and drugs proliferate and jobs are lost to overseas competition
and post-Cold War defence cuts.
The citizens of the US are suffering an identity crisis, Johnson finds, in a
society where race and gender are overwhelming the sense of American-ness.
'At present the forces that divide America are greater than those that unite
us.' Yet, he concludes, he is not writing the obituary of the American
Dream, only describing an interlude in its reclamation.
Their testimony suggests that Americans are no longer seeking scapegoats for
their ills. They are finally waking up to the fact that they have been
spoilt by post-war prosperity and must now take a cut in living standards.
They are waking up to the consequences of their tax-strike and credit binge
while the budget deficit exploded; to their strike against a federal
government they had been taught to despise as wasteful and malign; and to
their regicidal treatment of their own presidents.
Johnson details the early pratfalls of Bill Clinton's administration but
seems to find this president very much in tune with middle America, with
ordinary folk who have been chastened by the gung-ho market worship of
Ronald Reagan and his business backers and who now yearn for old community
values. They talk less about their rights, more about their duties.
A judge in Oakland, California, says of the homeless: 'We used to recognise
that we have a moral responsibility to these people. Now the idea seems to
be, if I can make it, they can make it.' A woman welfare officer in Maine
who resigned in protest at cuts says: 'I've always seen myself as a public
servant, and now I don't have that any more, so I'm not sure what I am. That
brings tears to my eyes.'
Americans, the rest of us, may derive morbid pleasure from wallowing in
their own problems and no doubt Johnson, in this sequel to his book on the
1980, Sleepwalking Through History, found it all too easy to gather the
testimony he wanted. Yet his interviewees' comments are too striking, their
message too persistent to be dismissed as mere grumbling.
There is a danger of repetitiveness as well as bias in this form of
instantaneous history. But the author's knowledge of the political and
economic story, his command of supporting facts and the doggedness of his
quest add up to a convincing and by no means uniformly depressing snapshot
of the American mood. If these citizens are typical, Americans have learned
to express what it is they need, not merely what they want. Perhaps they
will now persuade Congress to banish the lobbyists and let a reforming
president get on with the job of providing it.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Books: Seeking myth in dirty realist territory - Fiction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VILLAGE by David Mamet Faber Pounds 14.99, 238 pages
David Mamet's first novel is an assured, impressionistic, unhurried account
of a year in the life of a remote, unnamed New England village. It begins
with a flurry of interior monologues and colloquial dialogue from unknown
and undescribed characters. The conversations are so oblique, and Mamet is
so determined not to make life easy for us, that the initial effect is like
being at a party where nobody talks to you and nobody bothers to introduce
you to the other guests. This can be irritating, not to say downright
infuriating. But eventually the reader finds a point of access, starts to
feel at home and to know who's who and what they are talking about.
This is, as it were, an ensemble piece and there is no single protagonist,
but gradually we get to know the characters: Dick, who owns the local
hardware store and is going slowly, tortuously bankrupt; Henry, a newcomer
to the village whose head is full of new man, New Age confusion; Maris, a
youthful, sexual free spirit who comes to a nasty if inevitably ambiguous
end. And there is a full supporting cast that includes wife-beaters, gun
enthusiasts, hunters and story-tellers.
The novel is set in an unspecified, though strangely dated and nostalgic
present. Characters have phones and pick-up trucks for instance, but if
there are computers or televisions or fax machines then nobody talks about
them. Nobody goes to the movies or listens to popular music, which is a
shame in some ways because these people would learn a lot about themselves
from watching, say, The Last Picture Show or from listening to almost
anything by Bruce Springsteen.
There are times when we appear to be in standard dirty realist territory,
but other times Mamet seems to be yearning after something mythic rather
than realist. We have little sense of an outer world. We do not know who the
president is or what stage the cold war is at, but Mamet's point would no
doubt be that his characters' lives are little affected by such niceties,
that they exist in a more elemental region. But Mamet does not quite achieve
that mythic dimension, and perhaps that is largely because he wants it so
badly. The strain sometimes shows.
Of course, Mamet's dialogue is a wonderfully ornate and artificial
approximation of real speech (I was remined of Ivy Compton-Burnett), and the
detailed precision of his prose can sometimes sound like stage directions,
but this is not some dilettantish piece by a successful Broadway and
Hollywood writer flexing his muscles in a different genre. At a time when so
many novels read like raw material for the movies, Mamet has found exactly
the right form for what he has to say.
The best parts of the book are a series of virtuoso small scale set-pieces:
a man chops wood; the same man gets lost while trying to ski home through
the snow; a State Trooper has to tell a father that his son is dead; a
hunter stands all day in one spot waiting for the eventual and certain
arrival of a deer.
However, much as one can delight in these scenes, the reader is left
surprisingly unengaged by characters and events, a lack of engagement that
Mamet himself seems to share. He displays an icy detachment from his
creations. He may be God-like but he is distinctly unaffectionate. The end
result is a novel that it is easy to respect but very difficult to love.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Arts: Private passions, public lives - Clement Crisp abhors
the muck-raking in recent biography
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I don't care what people do, so long as they don't do it in the street and
frighten the horses'.
The comment was made at the time of Oscar Wilde's trial, and what an
admirable rule it could still prove today, when the publisher's office is
mistaken for the confessional, and rubbing the reader's nose in the dirt is
the justification for a good advance on royalties.
Once upon a time there was something called private life. It was no-one's
business what people got up to unless they left the bedroom and the horses
(and the moralists) reared up in alarm. No longer so, if stage or screen or
sport - or, heaven help us, politics - is your stamping ground. The new
style biography is a lubricious bore. 'Prurience pays' is the rule, and
dirty linen (chiefly bed sheets) is washed and hung out for all too see. A
recent cartoon in The New Yorker put it succinctly: it showed a hack at his
typewriter with the muse at his elbow urging 'More sleaze'.
In these dark days for life-stories, the real vice anglais is not an
addiction to the whip but to the keyhole. The kiss-and-tell brigade is
everywhere, though bang-and-boast is a better name. Even without the latest
royal romance - whose author should perhaps have called herself Doris
Pasternak - there has lately been a vulgar recounting of Pamela Harriman's
life in barely-readable Time-speak, and the tasteless garrulities of Sarah
Miles are now available in The Times. Muck-raking is replacing aerobics as
fashionable exercise; readers are forced to be voyeurs. We live in the age
of zoom-lens biography.
Now come the stories of two celebrated male dancers, Rudolf Nureyev and Irek
Mukhamedov, with authors eager to tell all. I am increasingly in favour of
biographies that may be said to tell nothing, and keep the skeletons in the
closet. (Is it not high time a lot of things were forced back into the
closet from which they have emerged?). The discretion that marked Margot
Fonteyn's autobiography, with no mention of intimacies, did not prevent its
being a wonderful record of her life, and one which later, grubbier
revelations do not diminish. It is the secrets of her artistry, not her
amours, which are of public worth. Her friends knew of her loves and
maintained a silence about her personal life, which says much for them, and
for her own grace as a woman. Yet in Peter Watson's Nureyev, we are told of
her pregnancy by Nureyev, and of an allegation that she 'took out a
contract' to kill the man who had shot her philandering husband, Roberto
Arias. The value  - and the credibility - of this stuff escapes me.
With serious creative talents, sexual nature must bear strongly upon the
products of that talent. But to be force-fed the storms and traumas of
Mukhamedov's first marriage in Jeffery Taylor's biography, or to learn from
Peter Watson of Nureyev's bath-house partners, seems to me both crass and
unnecessary. Sexual gossip may have some passing interest as social comment,
but for the most part it trivialises more than it enlightens. Does it make
any difference to our understanding of Mukhamedov as a superlative dancer to
learn that a 'minder' tried to climb into bed with him in Northampton, and
was beaten off? Do we learn more about Nureyev by knowing that in
Hollywood's gay community he was called The Great Vaselino?
Peter Watson's Nureyev (Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 20, 470 pages) is by turns
fascinating and exasperating. It combines admirable research about Nureyev's
Russian years - some gleaned from KGB files - with material of the flimsiest
interest about such individuals as Andy Warhol, at which moment it becomes a
narrative auditioning for the front page of the cheapest tabloid. Nureyev
was a promiscuous homosexual, haunting bars and bath-houses. His later
years, fighting against disease and the decline of his physical powers, are
tragically set against the Aids plague.
His sexual identity was significant, but it was only one aspect of a driven
personality that lived most truly on stage. Performance and applause were
his drugs, and everything came second to them, even the wild round of his
passing conquests. Apart from the classic dance, his greatest love was that
balletic Apollo, Erik Bruhn, and their vexed relationship - Nureyev as both
lover and as challenging and destructive rival - is well told. Yet there is
an element of lubricity in the narrative, of gossip for discreditable
gossip's sake, that I find unnecessary - not least in sections dealing with
Fonteyn's life.
A serious problem, too, is that Watson gives little evidence of
understanding the ballet world in which his subject was so central. The book
should have been edited by someone competent in dance matters to remove the
abundant errors in name and fact. I must also note that Watson's account of
Nureyev's last appearance on the stage of the Paris Opera, after the first
night of his Bayadere, minimises the dignity of his behaviour, which I saw.
He was indeed supported by two of the dancers, but his final salute showed
him princely still in gesture, and undefeated.
His last months are best understood through the beautifully written and
piercingly observed account by Rudi van Dantzig, the Dutch choreographer,
who visited Nureyev in the Quai Voltaire flat where he died. It was printed
in the programme book for a London gala in Nureyev's memory in March this
year. The dignity and precision of its writing make this book seem
meretricious, and the use of chatty captions for the photographs - 'Douce
Francois, who once dressed as a man to get into Rudolf's good books' - is
not without significance. I suppose it is the sort of hectic memoir
Nureyev's life off-stage merited. The grander story of his art on stage has
yet to be told.
Whether Irek Mukhamedov should have countenanced Jeffery Taylor's
'authorised' biography (Fourth Estate Pounds 18.99, 237 pages) is also a
matter where art and gossip conflict. His life, like Nureyev's, brings
insights into the secretive world of Soviet ballet, and into the shaping of
a superlative talent. But Mukhamedov is still in his prime, a dance-actor of
astonishing power and sensitivity. His ability to move from the Bolshoi
Ballet's soaring heroes (Spartacus and their ilk) to the soul-searching
challenges of MacMillan's Archduke Rudolph or the Foreman in Judas Tree is
testimony to his rare gifts. These will demand proper analysis - but not
yet, and Taylor does not essay it. Instead we are offered a seething account
of Mukhamedov's first marriage. It is of quite staggering lack of interest.
We are at the keyhole again, reluctant witnesses to other people's quarrels.
In the real world there is little so off-putting and tasteless; on the page
it is massively tiresome. Bad behaviour is a bore, and hugely as I admire
Mukhamedov the dancer, I cannot believe that these marital storms are
significant when considering his artistry.
What Taylor has done is to inflate a Sunday supplement article about a great
Soviet dancer adjusting to the West into a narrative bloated with passion
and recriminations. The book's value lies in its first-hand account of
Mukhamedov growing up, with less than encouraging detail of life and
political in-fighting at the Bolshoi. But it is premature as biography, and
uninteresting save in placing Mukhamedov in his artistic setting. It serves
this great dancer less well that his talent deserves.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Arts: Cabaret set for revival - In search of night life,
Antony Thorncroft finds Tony Martin at the Green Room
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London swings] Oh no it doesn't. Of all the major cities of the world London
is among the most dreary and unimaginative when it comes to night life.
Anyone who fancies a well-rounded celebration - a good meal, an exciting
cabaret and then a lively, or romantic, dance, had better get real.
It is not so bad if you are under 30. In fact these days it is quite lively.
There are the proliferating comedy clubs for a start, and if you are young
and smart you can spend your evenings queuing up outside dance clubs,
waiting to be rejected by the all mighty doormen.
But anyone falling at this hurdle, and committing the even greater sin of
maturity, faces an impoverished choice. Where are the gay night clubs of the
1920s and '30s, even of the '40s and '50s. All long gone. If you like jazz,
Ronnie Scott's is as reliable as ever, certainly the jokes are unchanging.
At Pizza on the Park, you get to hear some half forgotten names in comfort
(Julie Wilson is currently there). But traditional cabaret haunts are almost
as extinct as white ties and tails.
In recent months there has been another attempt to lure the middle aged,
middle classes, out at night. Hotels like the Dorchester and the
Lanesborough have joined the Savoy in adding a torch singer to the
traditional background pianist, at least at weekends. And the Cafe Royal has
gone all the way, creating the Green Room, a cabaret spot where you can also
dine and dance.
The Green Room has been going for a year now, and recently had its first
sell out season with the Three Degrees. Much encouraged, it is booking acts
well into next year. The choice is worryingly eclectic, throwbacks to
British television of the 1960s, like the Bachelors, jostling alongside such
greats as Bobby Short, the American cabaret performer who keeps alive the
tradition of Coward and Hutch; and Freddie Cole, brother of the more famous
Nat.
In a way this sums up the Green Room: while Barbra Streisand was selling out
Wembley at Pounds 250 a ticket, her sister Roslyn Kind was playing the Green
Room at Pounds 20. But there have been intriguing bookings: songwriter Jimmy
Webb for example, as well as sightings of such long lost stars as Frankie
Vaughan and Sasha Distel.
What can you expect from a visit to the Green Room? Well the cost is fixed -
Pounds 48 for meal and cabaret, Pounds 20 for the show alone. But no one
goes to the Green Room for the food. The action starts around 9.15pm; the
lights go down, blotting out the fact that by day the Room hosts conferences
of brand managers; and a star appears.
Until October 15 it is Tony Martin. Yes, that Tony Martin, the romantic
Hollywood lead of the 1940s who crooned to such leading ladies as Judy
Garland, Shirley Temple and Lana Turner, and who ended up marrying one of
them, Cyd Charisse. The Tony Martin who introduced Begin the Beguine and for
whom Jerome Kern wrote 'All the things you are'.
He is in amazing shape and the finest vocal fettle. The face and the hair
might be works of science rather than nature but his vocal range and breath
control are staggering. For Tony Martin is galloping towards his 82nd
birthday, and needs absolutely no critical favours. Unlike a younger rival,
Sinatra, he remembers the lyrics; he has also learned new songs, like 'The
wind beneath my wings'.
That is the attraction of cabaret. It might be a dying art form, but
watching Martin with his anecdotes about Irving Berlin, and his obvious
pleasure in still hitting and holding the notes (''All the things you are'
is an octave plus five', he points out), gives you a last, lingering, look
at one of the 20th century's greatest artistic heritages.
Tony Martin is at the Green Room, Cafe Royal until October 15. (071 437

FT  08 OCT 94 / Arts: Show Boat steams into Broadway / Review of Hal
Prince's production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly everything about Hal Prince's production of Show Boat, which opened
on Broadway last Sunday, is huge: the budget, Dollars 8.5m; the cast, over
70 performers and 30 musicians; the venue, the cavernous Gershwin Theatre;
the ticket prices, topping at Dollars 75, a new Broadway high; the hype, a
blitz of TV, radio and print advertisements; and the expectations. With only
one other major opening this autumn (Lloyd Webber's Sunset Boulevard), New
York is hungry for a hit.
So why is Show Boat's emotional impact so small? The problems are not
musical. With a company of marvellous voices, Prince's production is a
celebration of Hammerstein and Kern's classic score which includes such
favourites as 'Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man', 'Make Believe', 'You Are Love',
'Bill', and 'Ol' Man River'. This last, as sung by rich-voiced Michel Bell,
brings down the house. But the production fails to disguise the musical's
dramatic faults, which remain as evident on Broadway as they did at the
production's opening in Toronto a year ago.
Show Boat, written in 1927, follows 20 years in the lives of an extended
show-business family on the Mississippi paddle-steamer, Cotton Blossom: the
bickering father and mother, Cap'n Andy and Parthy Ann; their innocent
daughter, Magnolia, who is swept away and eventually done wrong by the
charming but raffish gambler, Gaylord Ravenal; and the boat's leading lady,
Julie, who is driven off the ship when she is revealed to be of mixed race.
This introduction of serious social issues - racism, gender politics, family
conflict - into musical comedy was to revolutionise musical theatre. Nearly
70 years later, however, the *something in here (HP) *
innovation that it triggered has left Show Boat way behind. There are levels
of realistic human behaviour and dramatic resolution we have come to expect
from our musicals and Show Boat simply does not deliver. Characters serve as
representations of ideas rather than complex, believable people; and
motivations and emotions are left troublingly unexplained - as with the
show's ending, in which Magnolia takes Ravenal back, 25 years after he
walked out on her, with not so much as a raised eyebrow.
Prince has skilfully updated the show's treatment of race by removing
references that contemporary audiences might find blatantly offensive (the
first word of the show is no longer 'niggers' but 'colored folk'), while not
covering up the racial inequality that was a fact in America during the time
the show is set. But attempts to beef up the show's flimsy characterisation
are too few. We could use many more touches like the moment added by Prince
in which Julie, who disappears without explanation from the original
musical, appears briefly late in the second act, washed-out and dissolute.
Far from advancing plot and character, the show's few scenes of dialogue
wander and drag, particularly those between John McMartin and Elaine Stritch
as Cap'n Andy and Parthy Ann, who turn in the show's least convincing
performances. McMartin overplays the Cap'n as an addled, fey, pathetic
showman (as did Robert Morse, whom he replaced during the show's Toronto
run), and Stritch's unmistakeably contemporary persona makes her presence on
the Cotton Blossom a complete anachronism. The remaining central performers
 -Rebecca Luker, Mark Jacoby, Dorothy Stanley, Joel Blum, and Michel Bell -
are attractive and in excellent voice; buttery-voiced Lonette McKee
particularly stands out as Julie.
This is Prince's first production of an existing musical - he made his name
with his roles in the creation of such new musicals as Sweeney Todd,
Company, Phantom of the Opera and Kiss of the Spider Woman - and it is
perhaps his distance from the material which has contributed to the Show
Boat's stately pace and reverent tone. The few typically Princean
directorial touches add welcome life: set changes are executed in full view
of the audience; supernumeraries move constantly on the periphery of the
action; costume and dance montages, joyfully choreographed by the ingenious
Susan Stroman (Crazy for You) provide the show's most effective and
entertaining moments.
For those for whom price is no object, a ride on this floating musical
theatre museum would surely not be a waste. The rest, be advised: the cast
album, on Livent Records, costs only Dollars 11.95.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Arts: Drama decidedly off the mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN SHUTTLEWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The story is told of a little girl watching the state opening of parliament
who pointed out the Lord Chamberlain in all his finery and loudly enquired,
'daddy, what's that man for?' Its a useful question to pose of plays every
so often, and the Stray Dog company's production of David Ashton's The Mark
founders upon it.
Ashton (author of Bush Theatre Productions A Bright light shining and The
Chinese Wolf) chooses to dignify his three-acter by allotting a separate
title to each 30 minute act and calling the result a trilogy, but the
puffery of such a move is implausible. The scenes tell in reverse chronology
of a simple-minded lad, violently sensitive about his facial birthmark which
gives the play its title, who murders his brother for not being the golden
boy he envisaged: first we see the increasingly cracked Johnny by his
brother's graveside on his release from prison, then the parents keeping
funereal vigil by the body several years earlier, and finally the real
relationship of the teenage brothers.
Of the three scenes, only the last contains any inherent element of stage
drama; the others, burdened as they are almost entirely with story telling
and recollections rather than any direct inter-action between characters,
suggest that the play may have started its life as one of Ashton's numerous
radio works.
Rather than attempting to transcend these limitations by playing to the
emotions and suggested complexities which the script does contain, Daniel
Slater's lumpen direction tries to create drama where there is none: Neil
McKinven's Johnny, with his brother's grave in front of him, addresses
alternate sections of the audience as his dead sibling, for no apparent
reason; and Anny Tobin, as the grieving mother, Theresa, is pushed into
realms of archetype which the character cannot sustain. Only Jake D'Arcy has
the courage entirely to refuse such reductive direction and play Theresa's
husband, Willie, in the more natural register in which he is written;
D'Arcy's performance is at odds with those around him, but an admirable
relief in itself.
Only in the last half hour are McKinven and Shamus Gubbins as idolised
brother Tommy allowed to attain what should be the general tone of the play
 -an awkward intimacy in which their empathy is undermined by moments of
misunderstanding and outright cruelty. However, both in terms of writing and
performance it is too little, too late.
This brotherly relationship is the foundation for a story, but remains a
long way from explicating all that we have seen before; the actors'
performances elicit only frustration at having sat through such simplistic
over direction for the last hour. Stray Dog must do more to earn its meaty
chunks.
At The Cockpit until October 29 (071 402 5081)

FT  08 OCT 94 / Arts: Manchester's Modernist comes to light / Review of Karl
Hagedorn, Derek Jarman and Cindy Sherman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Whitworth Art Gallery of Manchester University has a reputation for
imaginative temporary exhibitions that take risks, or look again at
forgotten artists. Two such are running at the moment.
Karl Hagedorn was born in Freiberg in Germany in 1889, but his antecedents
remain a mystery, albeit a romantic mystery. He was supposedly an
illegitimate son of Kaiser Wilhelm II - hagedorn means blackthorn, a name
often taken to indicate the royal bend sinister in Germany. Certainly the
several self-portraits in this exhibition, in youth and old-age, in their
particular likeness to Kaiser Bill, do nothing to confound such speculation.
He came to England in the mid-1900s, settling in Manchester where he studied
under Adolphe Valette, who was also Lowry's teacher. He was naturalised in
1914, was called up in 1916 and served out the war in Flanders with the
Middlesex Regiment. He left Manchester in the 1920s for London, where he was
active in the circle of the Royal Society of British Artists, which included
Minton and Carel Weight. He also taught for many years at Epsom School of
Art, so he was not exactly unknown to the London art world.
Only after his death in 1969, however, did the early work come to light, on
which this exhibition's claim for his being 'Manchester's first modernist'
rests. For the tragedy of his middle years was the death, in 1928, of Anne,
his only child. In his grief he abandoned his modernist ways and asked
Nellie, his wife, to destroy all his old work. Instead she hid it.
So it is we discover once more the lively work of a committed young artist,
already well-travelled in the years before 1914, and familiar with such as
Derain, Matisse - whom he visited - and Picasso. He was also knew the
Vorticists, Lewis, Bomberg and their friends, and the Bloomsbury avant garde
of Fry and Grant and Bell.
If what he did does not now exactly shatter our perception of modernism in
its great days, it was quite enough to stir up a little local controversy
when he showed with the Manchester Society of Modern Painters in the autumn
of 1913. 'Mr Hagedorn's rhythmical expressions', said the Manchester Evening
News, 'include one which happens to be a sea-green man - Robespierre was
pink to him - another seems like a kitchen dresser after an earthquake . .
.' Plus ca change . . . It is an intriguing and charming revival.
The late Derek Jarman's last works, Evil Queen, are hardly charming, but
they are intriguing, and given the circumstances in which they were made,
even moving. Through his last decline, unable to paint himself, Jarman
directed an assistant in achieving these manic, expressionist swirls and
vortices of pigment and colour. They are truly desperate things, for the
palpable hurt and anger they express, powerful enough even without the final
fierce inscriptions, scoured out of the paint, that were Jarman's only
direct contribution to the work. Ouch; Dead Sexy; Dizzy Bitch; Scream; Do
Lalley; Ataxia (Aids is Fun) - the cries grow weaker, the surfaces thinner,
as Jarman himself fades away.
This is not great art. Jarman began and always claimed to be a painter, but
the truth is that he made his greater contribution through his films. His
painting, rather, was ever impulsive, opportunistic, unsustained, and it is
only the special pleading of his particular condition that would make it
more. That is not to say, however, that this sad exhibition is not a most
poignant testament to our times.
Finally, a brief mention of Cindy Sherman, who is herself the subject of her
remarkable photographic works. Yet it is never self-conscious or
self-celebratory, for she takes on the impersonality of the true actor. She
has shown frequently in London, but never before in the country at large.
The show at the Manchester City Art Galleries offers a concise summary of
her career, from the Untitled Film Stills of the late 1970s, through the
ever-larger colour images of the '80s to the disturbingly gynaecological sex
images, with their dismembered dolls and disembodied masks, of the '90s. She
is a satirist and a surrealist of real power.
Manchester's First Modernist - Karl Hagedorn: Whitworth Art Gallery,
Manchester University, Oxford Road, Manchester, until November 26, then to
Chris Beetles, London. Evil Queen - Derek Jarman's Last Paintings: in

FT  08 OCT 94 / Arts: Furniture shines up its image - Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not so very long ago, antique furniture - most especially the brown English
variety - occupied a genteel backwater of the international market. Suddenly
it is centre stage. Now it is not paintings but top-drawer furniture - and
those decorative items the dealers and auction houses offer with it - that
is being gift-wrapped with splendid catalogues, world tours and black-tie
evening sales, and it is furniture that is riding a roller-coaster of
spectacularly successful sales and record prices.
In 1990 the J. Paul Getty Museum paid a record Pounds 8.6m for the so-called
Badminton Cabinet; last year a piece of English furniture, the 'Anglesey
Desk', made over Pounds 1m. In December, the collection of furniture, silver
and other objects belonging to the couturier Hubert de Givenchy, again sold
through Christie's, this time in Monaco, realised Pounds 17.67m.
Its handsome catalogue included a separate volume, with a marathon 25-page
catalogue entry, for the great silver 'Hanover Chandelier' made for George
II to the designs of William Kent. The catalogue for the forthcoming sale of
treasures from Houghton at Christie's in December promises to be even
grander.
It seems that furniture and what used to be called the decorative arts are
no longer the poor relations to painting and sculpture. The best have been
accorded the dignity and status of works of 'art', not 'craft'. Every aspect
of design and manufacture is a subject of study, every detail of provenance
recorded. Like the Rokeby Venus or the Portland Vase, these masterpieces
also take their name from the great houses or collectors who once claimed
them.
The changing status of furniture is due in large part to the coming of age
of furniture history. Enormous inroads have been made into the - still
shadowy - world of cabinet-making since the Furniture History Society was
founded in 1964. Now that it is possible to devote 25 pages to the
description, history, provenance, etc of a Kent chandelier or six pages to
an ormolu Matthew Boulton mantel clock - the sort of treatment once only
meted out to a great Picasso or a famous Old Master  - who can fail to be
impressed?
It is not only the auction houses that have benefitted from the collecting
public's apparent susceptibility to glossy, authoritative catalogues. John
Hobbs, a former partner in the London furniture dealers Carlton Hobbs,
believes the business really took off after the publication of its first
exquisite, scholarly catalogue of stylishly presented furniture. The firm
played a large part in establishing a taste for flamboyant Regency
furniture, and for levelling out the difference in prices between
exceptional pieces, be they French, Italian, Russian or English.
Revealingly, in John Hobbs' ambitious new venture in partnership with
Paris-based dealer Ariane Dandois - eight gallery spaces of impressive
furniture, sculpture and works of art in the old Design &amp; Decoration
Building at 107 Pimlico Road - there are no less than three full-time
researchers.
Given that English rather than Continental furniture is rarely signed and
poorly documented, the auction houses have astutely focused on provenance.
Recent auction successes have revealed that 20th-century provenances can be
made as enticing as those of the 18th. In 1991 Christie's sold the Sam
Messer collection for Pounds 7.7m, doubling the pre-sale estimate and
establishing a record for a collection of English furniture. Its catalogue
essay outlined the important role of the furniture historian and connoisseur
FW Symonds on post-war collecting. Now it seems that any piece from a
Symonds collector or collection is charmed and destined for great heights.
The Messer sale was a turning point. It re-established a taste for rich and
restrained carved Chippendale furniture that seemed particularly appropriate
to the new decade. The trade was alarmed by the gung-ho estimates. Messer's
splendid George III commode attributed to Chippendale bore an estimate of
Pounds 250,000-350,000; the hammer came down at Pounds 850,000.
At the Geoffrey Blackwell sale in 1992 - another Symonds collector -
estimates were far from conservative. Even so, a George II walnut mirror
estimated at Pounds 20,000-30,000 was knocked down at Pounds 85,000, a
George II burr walnut kneehole dressing table (estimate Pounds
40,000-50,000) at Pounds 125,000. In July, a George II walnut card table
that had belonged to Percival Griffiths, Blackwell and Sir James Caird,
fetched Pounds 120,000 hammer, four times the lower estimate.
These extravagant prices beg the question that if the auction room is the
best place to sell a great piece of furniture, can it be the best place to
buy? The furniture market may be in danger of over-heating. No one would
benefit from collectors and dealers left with a glut of over-expensive,
unsaleable furniture on their hands. But unlike the overblown Impressionist
market of the late 1980s, it is still not possible to buy a piece of
furniture in January and sell it at a profit in July.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Collecting: Fiac optimism prevails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Made homeless by the closure of Paris's Grand Palais, this year's 21st Fiac
contemporary art fair is housed, until October 16, in accommodation supplied
by culture minister Jacques Toubon - some 14,000 sq m of white tent on the
Quai Branly, near the Eiffel Tower.
Slightly fewer galleries, 160 as compared to 168 last year, are taking part
and the foreign contingent has shrunk from 79 to 67 dealers, including seven
British galleries, but only eight Americans as against 14 last year.
Even if the Fiac now comes second to the Basle Fair in June as Europe's top
contemporary arts show, the tone this year is still optimistic.
Declared trading at last year's fair rose to FFr150m (Pounds 18m) following
an all-time low of FFr100m in 1992 and organisers hope that 150,000 visitors
will pay FFr50 each to crowd under the canvas over the coming week.
The recession has radically affected prices - as much as 50 per cent lower
than during the boom years of the 1980s - and the art on show. Many dealers
have abandoned the staid, big-name works, once reckoned a good bet in hard
times, to invest in younger, low-priced artists and thus in genuine
contemporary art.
To encourage this trend, this week's Fiac, instead of spotlighting galleries
from a guest country as in previous years, is inaugurating a special section
called 'nouvelles tendencies', housing 35 galleries showing works by young
artists.
Paintings by Paul Pagk, the British artist, are being shown by the Toulouse
gallery of Eric Dupont, who is also exhibiting Hyun Soo Choi, the Korean,
and the young Frenchman Musee Khombol. The Marc Jancou Gallery from London's
Foley Street, a Fiac newcomer, is exhibiting pieces by British artists Jane
Simpson, Martin Creed and Jasper Lester.
Several major galleries, such as Paris's Durand-Dessert and Alain Blondel
are making do with a selection of works by their stable of artists but
almost 70 other stands are staging shows by just one or a handful of people:
Paris's Galerie Lahumiere, for example, is exhibiting 10 works by Auguste
Herbin, covering the artist's very varied career from 1917-1959, at prices
from Ffr500,000 to FFr1.8m (Pounds 60,000-Pounds 220,000).
Fellow Parisians Artcurial are devoting their display to the work of five
women artists, Sonia Delaunay, Natalia Dumitresco, Germaine Richier,
Margaretha Farner and the Danish Sonja Ferlov.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Collecting: Art to warm a winter evening - Autumn in
Manhattan brings the chill and the International fair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL JEROMACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By mid-October, Manhattan has settled in for the long winter. The air
usually has a bracing snap and Manhattan society is looking forward to
welcoming the winter season in the way it knows best - by buying something.
The stage is set for the sixth annual International Fine Art and Antiques
Fair, which holds its gala opening in the Park Avenue Armory, in Manhattan,
on Thursday, October 13. The show runs until Thursday, October 20.
The International is organised by Brian and Anna Haughton, London
ceramic-specialists turned entrepreneurs. It made its debut at a time when
its biggest rival, the long-established Winter Antiques Show, was going
through an acrimonious time, involving accusations of mismanagement by its
former chairman Mario Buatta, widespread defections of established dealers
and, most important, revelations that several items featured by its leading
exhibitors had been, in the words of one discreet colleague, 'creatively
refinished and embellished'.
The Winter Antiques Show was shaken by the International's strict vetting
policies. These determined authenticity and the amount of restoration of
every item proposed. The International became a venue where the prospective
buyer could relax and buy with confidence.
'We won't have imitations in,' said Anna Haughton. 'For instance, there are
perfectly good 19th century ceramics that are exact copies of popular 18th
century models. Even though many of these were legitimately produced, and
the dealer may represent them as 19th century, they would not be permitted
at the International show because they are straight copies. There is no
problem with 'revivalist' pieces of a later century: they are clearly of
their time.'
Still, the vetting procedure is not without its problems. At the Haughton's
first Fine Art Fair in New York last spring, several exhibitors complained
that the vetting committee (made up mostly of other exhibitors) occasionally
placed personal rivalry above aesthetic considerations, expelling items that
should have been included, and vice-versa.
It can be difficult to get objective vettors, as several curators and
restorers from the Metropolitan Museum were forbidden to participate.
Nevertheless, Anna Haughton said: 'Each year, we have more and more outside
vettors. This year we have 90, and 30 of them are museum curators.'
When asked who they were, she demurred, saying: 'there are always some
people who don't want to be listed.' Although a list was promised, Haughton
backtracked a few hours later, telling me: 'We have decided not to publish a
list of vettors this year.'
The most important painting ever featured at the International Show was
Bernardo Bellotto's 'Fortress of Konigstein,' featured in Bruno Meissner's
booth in 1992. Its exhibition there was instrumental in its subsequent sale
(for approximately Pounds 6m) to the National Gallery of Art.
While there are still a good number of picture and drawing dealers
exhibiting (Richard Green returns with his Impressionists and Old Masters,
featuring works by Canaletto and Camille Pissarro, and first-timer Jill
Newhouse with Old Master and nineteenth century drawings including an early
Turner Watercolour of Florence and Degas' study of Julia Belelli), the
International has developed into more of an 'object' fair.
Unlike European collectors, Americans have not yet warmed to the idea of
buying Old Masters at fairs, and it remains to be seen whether the
Haughton's spring Fine Art fair can convince them otherwise.
While the International has no stated yearly theme, this year a several
exhibitors feature Oriental sculpture and Orientalist-inspired European and
American works of art. In the former category, veteran Newn York dealer Bob
Ellsworth has a rare Chinese bronze chariot group consisting of two horses,
a chariot driver from the Han dynasty. Michael Goedhuis, of London, will
show a similarly large number of monumental Chinese works in bronze and
iron, including a large 13th-century Iron Head of Lohan and a 17th-century
bronze Buddhist Lion, originally a guard for a private shrine, one of a
handful of pieces signed by the caster Shunsei.
In addition to many works of modern and ancient European art, the Belgian
dealer Axel Vervoordt also features Oriental sculpture, including a large
Chinese Song dynasty Seated Lohan of lacquered wood. Doris Wiener offers
Indian and Cambodian sculpture; she is showing a life-size 11th century
Khmer sandstone figure of Shiva, a notable 10th century Ganesha and
Elephant-headed Deity known as a 'Remover of Obstacles and Bestower of
Worldly Success' from Java. The Chinese Porcelain Company has a 19in high
Khmer bust of a 10-armed Goddess Durga from c. 960-965. Earle D. Vandekar of
Knightsbridge will show a decorative pair of 18th-century Chinese bronze
Lion-dogs.
Partridge Fine arts offers orientalist furniture including a red-lacquered
Chinoiserie bureau-cabinet (c 1720) attributed to Master Martin Schnell who
worked in the service of Emperor Augustus the Strong at Dresden. Frederick P
Victoria features two elaborate Chinoiserie painted over-doors, probably
made for the Villa La Favorita, and a Chinoiserie folly created by the King
of Naples after he took up residence in Sicily at the end of the 18th
century.
Orientalism of a different sort is featured by Margot Johnson, who
specialises in the American Aesthetic-movement specialist. She has a
delicate Japonesque inlaid table by LeJambre of Philadelphia c 1880, (in
addition to several fine pieces of furniture by Herter Brothers). David
Pickup (one of the most popular exhibitors), offers a British
Aesth-etic-movement brass canopy bed from around 1872 complete with its
original pink-and-oatmeal embroidered cover and drapes.
Most of the dealers are enthusiastic about their prospects. Says Michael
Goedhuis: 'People are looking forward to it - it is the first item on the
social agenda this autumn. They have not been spending very freely in the
past three or four years, but there is a lot of anticipation this year.
'It is hard to get a handle on what's going on in the art market today,
though. You cannot pan out the same old boring rubbish about people being
'only interested in the top line.' But this show is very good. Only Biennale
in Paris makes more money for its dealers, although the rest of Europe is
fairly dead. The big market remains in America.'

FT  08 OCT 94 / Gardening: Monsters on the loose - Robin Lane Fox wants his
cypresses cut to size
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In this kind autumn, my garden has its successes at last: a second season on
the yellow-flowered clematises of which the Bill Mackenzie variety is much
the best; yet more flowers on a new deep blue salvia called Indigo Skies
which looks much too good to survive a hard frost; better Asters, of which
more soon, and a stupendous crop of berries, already set on Sorbus
vilmorinii, that superb small tree.
Successes are heartening, but they are overshadowed by progress in another
department. The greatest garden monster ever let into Britain has put on
another growth spurt and, in the next few days, the survivors will cost me
several hundred pounds in order to reduce them to size.
Why ever did we let Leylandii cypress trees on to general release?
Uninformed gardeners buy them for good reasons: privacy, boundaries and fear
of the neighbours and their ideas of bearable architecture. The little trees
grow wildly at first, but we now know to what heights this wildness goes.
No-one knows it better than I, who bought a garden with more than 200
Leylandii, planted in the early 1970s.
In open country, the first principle of Leyland management is much the same
as the one now applied at UK motor plants: engage gear and charge the assets
head-on with a hired JCB digger, its front bucket will then eliminate the
roots.
Tree surgeons will quote you prices as high as a Leylandii for felling it
scientifically, but the tree snaps easily when charged with a digger. The
roots come out easily with a little bucketing because they do not go far and
wide. They tend to point downwards like the sides of a modern corkscrew. The
JCB method is much the cheapest, but it would not be popular in a heavily
built up area.
As my Leylandii approach their 25th birthday, they are 60 ft high and
increasing ominously in girth. Old age accelerates their progress: the upper
20 feet have been put on in the last six years. I have tried to view them
artistically, like those great cones of greenery in the background of the
highly-prized paintings by David Inshaw in the 1970s. The attempt has failed
because the texture, colour and scale of these trees are all awful. So I
have applied Leyland management principle number two.
In the early years of their arrival, the books used to say that an old
Leylandii would never recover if it was severely cut back. This advice is
now known as the Lord Stokes principle. In fact, these sprawling monsters
are almost forgive-able if they are severely reduced in height and slimmed
in size. If you cut back into old wood, it will soon be covered by a renewed
curtain of grey-green feather.
This week I am having to fork out for a severe Leylandii reduction, knocking
30 ft off the top with the only consolation that the huge clippings can be
recycled through the shredder as next year's mulch. If a Leylandii essential
to your garden plan is overpowering you, ignore the experts and cut it
neatly: it will soon recover from the wound.
After reduction, the trees can be brightened up using an idea which occurred
to me three years ago. Use the remaining hedge as a support for vigorous
climbing roses. I have started a race between some of the best-known
white-flowered ramblers. The winner is the spectacular Rambling Rector,
followed by the lesser-known - and much scarcer - Long John Silver.
Varieties with heavy tangles of growth are less satisfactory because they
refuse to lie flat against the cypresses' soft curtain of feather. Bobbie
James is always a sound bet, but the weight of growth is a problem.
White-flowered roses show up very well, but this year, I have found their
equal in a pale buff-yellow variety which is ignored in garden centres.
Among roses, the one equal to the monstrous cypress is the stupendous white
rose called Kiftsgate. The original plant, in Kiftsgate gardens,
Gloucestershire, is still powering away up tall beech trees and along a
thicket which is now hundreds of yards wide.
Few people know that this terrifying rose once fathered a child: somewhere,
it leapt on a defenceless Hybrid Tea variety and the result is known as
Treasure Trove, sold by Peter Beales in Norfolk.
Its young growth and leaves are plum-red and it races up Leylandii with some
of the vigour of its wayward parent: the small flowers appear freely in
clusters during late June and turn to a shade which reminds me of pink
grapefruit. I may have introduced an equal monster, but so far I think that
Treasure Trove is a find for anyone who has been landed with these frightful
hedges.
At ground level, there is one seasonal compensation. A few feet away from
the roots of your reduced Leylandii, you should plant flowers, the hardy
Neapolitan cyclamen, in shades of pink and white, is perfect for this time
of year.
On the sunny side of the hedge, you can add the large-flowered Colchicums
which look like huge crocusses in autumn: they must have sun if they are to
flower properly, whereas the cyclamen will prosper in shade. Leave them to
seed gradually, assisted by passing ants and your own careful distribution
of any visible seedlings. This ant-like activity in the shadow of a 'hedge'
is one small compensation for the dreary, loose curtain of feathery green
above.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Property: Cheer in the UK rental market - Cadogan's Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK market for buying and selling houses may be patchy, but the London
rental market is thriving.
Third-quarter statistics from Cluttons London Residential, show an average
increase of 4.5 per cent in the quarter and of 10.6 per cent year-on-year.
But the steep quarterly increase is unlikely to remain strong since it
merely reflects the peak months when people relocate before school starts.
This year, as economic recovery continues, more corporate staff are on the
move than a year ago.
The prime areas of Belgravia, Knightsbridge, Kensington and Chelsea have led
the recent charge with quarterly increases of more than 5 per cent. But, on
an annual view, Fulham takes the prize with a rise of 20.9 per cent.
Aylesford reports that the average rent for its lettings has increased from
Pounds 480 a week a year ago to Pounds 515. Most properties are in the
Pounds 400-Pounds 600 range.
These increases will improve yields, which were 10 per cent in 1992 and 1993
but had fallen as property prices rose. For the prime areas, 8 to 8.5 per
cent is now feasible.
Investor-landlords seeking a still higher yield should turn to Battersea,
Clapham or Fulham - which are not the parts of London on top of American
corporate tenant lists.
American tenants in the UK are usually on company lettings. These are always
strong in central London, forming 36 per cent of Aylesford's tenants in
1993-94 as against 23 per cent from the UK.
For 1991-93 the US proportion was higher at 43 per cent, and the UK 19 per
cent. UK tenants mostly take assured shorthold tenancies, which give the
landlord security of repossession under the Housing Act 1988. (Company
lettings come under commercial law.)
Unfurnished lettings are on the increase. Americans often prefer empty
premises and the chance to ship over their own furniture and household
items.
Letting property abounds with quirks of law and practice, including coping
with the Inland Revenue if one is a non-resident landlord. To guide
landlords through the maze, Cluttons London Residential has published The
Lettings Handbook, which aims to cover all the problems in a practical way.
Call 071-824 8822 for a free copy.
Property insurance is equally rich in difficulties, especially for listed
buildings. The hugely expensive fires at Uppark and Windsor Castle, have put
older properties in the spotlight.
Owners who worry about what perils to cover, and how much cover they need,
will find A Guide to the Insurance of Listed Buildings and their Contents
helpful.
This is produced by Jackson-Stops with brokers Gauntlet Heritage and
Lycetts, Phillips, the auction house, Thames Valley Fire Protection and Sell
Wade Postins, historic building architects.
There is advice on saving money on flood, subsidence and contents insurance,
types of fire alarms and what is involved in reinstating buildings after
damage (since rebuilding costs vary sharply for older properties).
The report costs Pounds 5 from Jackson-Stops &amp; Staff, 22 Hans Place, London
SW1X OEP.

There are people who would sooner confess they beat their dogs than admit to

Victorian - even Edwardian is acceptable - trophy homes are as desirable as
a Land Rover Classic (as a second car), or the best school for the children.
Among the aspirant classes however, are many who baulk at paying the period
home premium because they are wary of inheriting old house crankiness.
Increasingly, the solution is to commission a new house which is designed
and built to look old - a kind of off-the-peg heritage.
In East Anglia, Stephen Mattick builds homes with traditional, vernacular
pargetting that blend seamlessly into the neighbourhood. In Surrey, Paul
Sweeney's new houses look so convincingly old that a local planning officer
insisted they must be conversions.
In Wiltshire, Andrew Pownall-Gray, financial planning consultant with Allied
Dunbar, chose Peter Borchert to design and build a 'new' Georgian home. He
and his wife, Judy, even sold a real Georgian house to do it.
'She was dubious because she has always lived in period properties,' says
Pownall-Gray. 'But when she saw what Peter had done, she became an instant
convert.
'It is not always easy to find the house you want in the Pounds 300,000 to
Pounds 400,000 range. We wanted something which was cheap to heat, had
well-proportioned rooms and didn't have too many skeletons in the cupboard.'
Borchert, an aeronautical engineer and pilot - he owns part of a Tiger Moth
and is helping to renovate a Walrus, a second world war seaplane - before
turning to house design, employed brickwork, windows and roof slates as they
would have been used in the late-Georgian period.
'There are few examples of large period country houses that haven't been got
at,' he says. 'Where there is affluence over a period of time, people have
had the money to change the house by ripping out many of the old features.
To create a new one is an alternative.'
Another attractive inducement, he points out, is that value added tax does
not apply to new building although VAT must be paid on materials used in
restoring an old house. This certainly was a consideration for the
Pownall-Grays.
The final bill for their five-bedroom house was Pounds 130,000, in addition
to land costs of Pounds 140,000. When they sold it recently, they got Pounds
285,000 - which must be considered a modest success, considering the limp
condition of the housing market.
'The advantage of having the house built was that we had a full bespoke
service,' says Pownall-Gray, who is now renting while he looks for a site
where Borchert can build him a large country house. With two children in
situ, plus nanny, and twins due in November, more space has become a
priority.
Borchert's previous experience includes a courtyard of new,
traditionally-designed buildings including a swimming pool, pavilion,
orangery and cottage in the grounds of The Grange, a restored manor house
near Salisbury. At present, he is working on five new cottages - including
thatched, timber-framed, flint and brick, and rendered cobb - in the Dorset
conservation village of Winterbourne Dauntsey.
Borchert admits locals were apprehensive at first about his planning
application, but adds that they have subsequently been reassured as to his
honourable intentions. 'There is a place for modern architecture but not in
housing,' says Borchert, whose views on the subject have much in common with
those of Prince Charles.
'We can suffer it in a car park, or a civic building. The worst examples are
in concrete and glass and there's a coldness about them. They have no living
qualities.'
It is an attitude that provokes fury in the modernist camp, a leading
exponent of which is Czech-born Jan Kaplicky. He says repro houses are on a
par with film sets.
Future Systems, the company he runs with Amanda Levete, has recently
designed a four-level house in Islington, north London, with two solid walls
and roof and two glass walls. Sitting between two protected buildings in an
area where even the trees are on the protection register, it has attracted
six pages of breathless excitement in Vogue magazine.
If Kaplicky had tried to build it in Edinburgh New Town or Stow-on-the-Wold,
locals would have burned his effigy in the street, his 'thoughtful, dreamy
lyricism' (according to Vogue) notwithstanding. But Kaplicky is defiant.
'Every other country in Europe builds thousands of modern houses,' he says.
And he insists that the fact he was born in Prague, home to some of the most
beautiful baroque architecture is 'irrelevant'.
'Only in (Britain) is there a mental block. I fully respect houses from any
period, but you can't build copies. You don't have the craftsmen who can do
it without an extraordinary financial premium. They can't build the quality
like they used to when people worked for pennies.
Kaplicky cites Poundbury, the model village being built in Dorset with the
support of Prince Charles, as proof of his theory. He describes it as
'awful, from what I've seen on television. It's basically Hollywood'.
He adds: 'I don't think it is the case that you should match existing houses
in a village when you are building a new one. Time goes on. You can't tell
the inhabitants they must drive only old cars or horses and carriages. It's
nonsense.'
Yet, nostalgia is getting younger. Sir Edwin Lutyens (who died in 1944) is
being copied, too. Orchard House, a two-year-old, five-bedroom, red brick
house near Henley-on-Thames, Berkshire, is designed in what estate agent
Knight Frank and Rutley describes as 'traditional Lutyens style'.
To assist its assumed identity, it was planted in a mature plot which
includes river frontage to the Thames, large trees, and a lake fed by an
ancient moat. Less traditionally, there is a garden lighting system with a
programmable waterfall into the lake. The three-bay garage block, flanked by
stone balustrades, is designed to match the house and offers of around
Pounds 1.2m are being sought for the whole property.
Savills, which is selling a genuine Lutyens house for Pounds 450,000 in
rural Northamptonshire - admittedly, not as desirable as Berkshire - says
the proof of the pudding is in the ingredients. Even a repro will command a
good price if the materials used are of high quality and it is a top of the
market house. This is especially so for overseas buyers who want to walk
into a house without having to deal with expensive maintenance bills.
John D. Wood is also selling a genuine Lutyens: the Dutch House, near
Dorking, Surrey, for Pounds 400,000. That sounds like a snip - until you
realise it stands on the busy A24 dual carriageway.
Who would pay more than a million for a copy? 'A true Lutyens' fan would pay
a premium for the real thing,' admitted Knight Frank and Rutley's Andrew
Rome, when pressed. But he added: 'The beauty of a new house is its modern
facilities. Placed in a very old setting, as is Orchard House, it is a
perfect combination.'

FT  08 OCT 94 / How To Spend It: Crafty gift ideas with cachet - Lucia van
der Post considers the pleasures of owning hand-made goods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To all those who think of the crafts as a peripheral phenomenon, it might
come as something of a surprise to learn that in 1993 some 13m people
visited a craft shop or gallery.
The Crafts Council has just produced what it calls an independent
socio-economic study of craftspeople which says that there are about 25,000
working in England, Scotland and Wales.
These are interesting figures and evidence that the pleasure people get from
making things by hand is almost matched by the pleasure others getting from
owning objects that are not mass-produced. The figure, though, that would
really interest me is what kind of a wage craft workers make.
The difficulty, as always, lies with the fact that few retailers have woken
up to a shift in people's tastes. It still remains true that those who long
for things that are individual, one-off, hand-made and desirable have few
places to go where they can regularly be sure of seeing them. Peripatetic
craft markets and market stalls are still the most common way for
craftspeople to sell their wares.
However, many enlightened retailers discovered some years ago that just a
few quirky, idiosyncratic artefacts in their shop could bring a lot of life
and fun to the business of selling life's necessities.
Joseph, always a touchstone for retailers, has been selling furniture by
designers such as Andre Dubreuil, Tom Dixon and Mark Brazier-Jones, and
chandeliers, candelabra, glass and ceramics by other makers. Sales may be
limited but Joseph understands that they lend a bit of dash and pizzazz to
the atmosphere of the shop as well as providing a much needed platform for
designers.
Egg, one of the sensational retailing successes of the year - Maureen
Doherty, its owner and buyer, had to shut her shop during August as she had
nothing left to sell - is loved by its customers because it is not like any
other emporium.
Besides the ranges of Indian cotton khadi trousers and jackets - and
beautiful silks by Asha Sarabhai - there is always a selection of exquisite
hand-made pots and hand tie-dyed silks and smocking, goods made with love
and care.
Nicole Farhi, in her airy new shop in New Bond Street, London, has gone to
the trouble of scouring Italy for hand-made pieces; wooden stools, glass
vases, quirky plates, *something in here (HP) *
bowls and wrought-iron candlesticks. (Although one wonders why it has to be
Italy when there is so much that is splendid in the UK.)
Admirable though these retailers are, there is still the big problem that
there are not enough who think as they do and that crafts sold through
standard retailing outlets have to absorb a huge mark-up (100 per cent plus
VAT) and this puts the goods beyond the reach of many.
All of which brings me to Chelsea Crafts Fair, which opens on Tuesday and
runs until October 23.
Many Weekend FT readers have become regular fans, going back year after year
to look for special anniversary or Christmas presents, to find a craft
worker who will make a one-off piece of furniture, a made-to-measure chest
of drawers, candlesticks of specific dimensions or jewellery for a special
occasion.
Last year some 28,000 visitors trooped through the doors of Chelsea old town
hall in Kings Road, London and the fair has become one of the biggest,
best-known forums for arts and crafts.
The work has been sifted carefully - far more people apply than can be
accommodated - but the result is a big and varied exhibition where almost
every craft is represented. Fashion, textiles, ceramics, glassware,
jewellery, toys, papier mache and bookbinding - there ought to be something
for everyone.
Do not, however, expect everything to be cheap.
Many people who ought to know better persist in feeling that hand-made goods
should cost less than machine-made articles but, although crafts often do
represent wonderful value, they cannot be cheap if fine materials (solid
wood, gold, precious stones, silver, enamels) and intricate workmanship have
been used.
I urge London readers not to miss the Chelsea Crafts Fair. There will be a
completely different set of exhibitors each week so it may well be worth
going twice. The fair opens from 10 am to 8 pm, Tuesdays to Saturdays, and
10 am to 6 pm on Sundays. Entrance fee is Pounds 7 for one visit each week,
Pounds 5 for a single visit.
Finally, if you have time today, hurry along to the last day of the
Goldsmiths' Fair, at Goldsmiths Hall, Foster Lane, London EC2V 6BN.
Jewellers and silversmiths will be showing and selling a vast range of
jewellery, cutlery, salt and pepper pots, claret jugs, vases, goblets etc -
again a marvellous place to pick up special presents. It is open from 11 am
to 7 pm. The Pounds 1 entrance fee includes a catalogue.

FT  08 OCT 94 / How To Spend It: Cuddly appliances for a dream kitchen -
Lucia van der Post tests designs for the caring '90s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Have you heard about the sweet, caring 1990s? In case you had not noticed we
have left the bad, greedy, tough 1980s behind and now we all are all
supposed to be as soft as pussycats, full of peace and goodwill. This, at
any rate, is the message the fashion pundits have been trying to press upon
us. Now it has reached the kitchen.
Alessi, a hugely innovative and enterprising Italian company most renowned
for its fine cookware and its collaboration with French designer Philippe
Starck, has joined forces with Philips, the Dutch company most renowned for
its efficient but visually unexciting domestic appliances, to produce a
small Philips-Alessi line of kitchen aids.
They have clearly taken the new 1990s to their hearts. Soft pastel colours,
cosy rounded shapes, cute little cuddles between the two parts of the coffee
maker ('the two parts snuggle up to each other like cuddly pets,' say the
makers) - all this says Philips-Alessi, is part of a partnership designed to
'rehumanise' the kitchen.
Alessi has a fine record for managing to combine innovative design with
genuinely improved function. I still think the range of cookware it devised
with some of the world's top chefs way back in '87 is one of the best and,
whatever you think of kettles with sweet little singing birds, Alessi has
injected a lot of wit and fun into what could otherwise be sombre
utilitarian objects.
Certainly it was a desire to inject some warmth into the kitchen that
inspired the collaboration. Stefano Marzano, Director for Philips Corporate
Design, perceived among 1990s people a desire to recreate the Elizabeth
David ideal of the kitchen as 'the heart and soul of home life.' Or as
Alberto Alessi puts it: 'Philips tended to see design as a way of satisying
needs, whereas we were inclined to see it as a way of fulfilling dreams. By
combining these two approaches . . . we believe we've created the best of
both worlds.'
The toy-town-meets-Disney aesthetics seem to be part of an attempt to
humanise the objects and the companies' statements are spattered with
anthropomorphic phrases. The products, they say, 'clearly form a family.'
And: 'Clever, 'human' touches in the design provide the products with extra
personality which . . . will encourage users to feel more involved in the
rituals of food and drink preparation.' All very nice, too.
But do they work? Alessi and Philips between them do seem to have gone to
immense trouble over function.
The citrus press, for instance, works silently and quickly, the glass simply
sits beneath the spout which after the juicing is over can be pushed back so
that there are no drips.
The toaster has a sensor system which means every piece of bread is toasted
to the same colour and the slot is able to cope with large, thick slices of
bread. The kettle is cordless, boils one litre of water in just over three
minutes and has a scale filter. All are made from combinations of
polypropylene and stainless steel.
Like most artefacts with strong personalities, these will not be to
everybody's taste but those who love them will love them dearly. Three of
the products (the citrus press and toaster) go on sale today in Harrods of
Knightsbridge, London SW1, Selfridges, John Lewis and many other stores
throughout the country, including House of Fraser Stores outside London. The
coffee maker will be on sale in January.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Fashion: Versatility is the key to winter coats - Heath
Brown chooses some hard-working classics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Heath Brown
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a businessman buys an overcoat its suitability for work is a priority -
which usually means a degree of sobriety; cloth that is dark, lines that are
tailored in classic style. Once acquired this is often the only serious coat
he owns - for weekends and off-duty hours pseudo-mountaineering styles and
faux country looks take over and he usually dons an anorak or, possibly, a
waxed jacket.
But the formal weekday mantle need not be banished to the closet on Friday
nights. Classically traditional overcoats can be made to work a seven-day
week if you choose carefully.
Today's eclectic fashion mood means a well-chosen greatcoat can be sharp and
effective when arriving at a high-powered meeting, yet stylish and relaxed
if teamed with a heavy fisherman's sweater and a pair of corduroy jeans.
It would work equally well with layers of unstructured shirts and tops.
David Mullane, the buyer for the high fashion emporium, Warehouse, in
Glasgow, says: 'The more classic the coat, the more suitable it is to be
worn casually as well.'
Indeed, the better fashion designers have realised this and are producing
more classic coats that can happily cross the divide between office and
home, from city to country, and become one of the most versatile garments in
a man's wardrobe.
Traditional city looks have been plagiarised and adapted to mix and mismatch
in looks from designers such as Katharine Hamnett, Giorgio Armani and Paul
Smith.
They have brought traditional coat styles, such as the velvet-collared
Chesterfield and the double-breasted paddock coat, up on to the catwalk.
British and Italian designers are pilfering the traditional city wardrobe
and creating new classics from old.
Dolce e Gabbana, the Italian design duo, are leaders in this post-modernist
design ethic, gleaning trends from the well-groomed commuter and marrying
oversize Crombies and double-breasted woollen car coats with sporty leggings
and corduroy.
The real appeal of these coats is that they offer high quality and high
style and long-term value.
A beautifully-made garment in an avant-garde style may be a thrilling
fashion statement but it is far too frivolous for many to contemplate. Money
spent on a long-lasting classic, that can be worn in many different ways,
makes a lot of sense.
Today's male customer is much more interested in fashion and design than his
father. He wants fabulous clothes that are well-made, recognised and admired
by others, and yet are not too showy or aggressively fashion-conscious.
Adrian Clark, fashion editor of Fashion Weekly, welcomes a return to
traditional tailoring and classic coats. But he reminds us that too casual a
look does not look right in the city.
'The ridiculous trend for wearing waxed jackets over pinstripe suits on the
city commuter circuit should be put away once and for all. By all means wear
your city coat to the country pub but never be tempted to add rural charm to
your nine-to-five two-piece. Versatility works in only one direction - from
smart to relaxed,' he says.
To create the relaxed look with the overcoat, soft layers and chunky knits
loosen the rigidity of the tailoring. Be careful or you may end up looking
like a first-year arts student.
Match your clothes to the quality of your coat (which ought to be the best
you can afford). Heavy boots and textured trousers, such as cord or
moleskin, can complement weightier woollen coats and contribute to an
overall image that is robust, modern and manly.
When choosing this most important of garments these basic points must be
considered. Make sure that there is enough room for your suit underneath to
allow you to move freely. Always wear your suit when choosing and buying and
do not be embarrassed to wave your arms about to make sure it is roomy
enough.
Go for the best quality wools and natural fibres or, if possible, cashmere
or microfibres for a less heavy, easier wearability.
If you are short, opt for knee-length, single-breasted styles. If you are
taller, choose longer, calf-length styles that are perhaps double-breasted
or belted. Choose plain, dark colours or fine, woven feint-banded browns.
Finding the perfect winter coat may take hours. Department stores can be
disappointingly mediocre when it comes to outerwear. Exceptions are Harrods,
Simpsons, Burberry's and most larger branches of Austin Reed where good
names, such as Chester Barrie, Crombie and Daks, can be found.
Fashion stores, too, offer some great ranges - and not necessarily at more
expensive prices. The new Jigsaw for Men range has a selection from Pounds
165. Harvey Nichols has a slightly higher-priced range but offers top
quality. This season's best buys are at Joseph with its own Joseph Homme
range outshining the designer labels.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Cookery: Is there anyone for squash?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I confess I am a nosey parker. Sights and smells gleaned in other people's
kitchens inspire me. In markets, supermarkets and specialist shops I find it
hard to resist staring into other people's shopping baskets and mentally
trying out recipes using the ingredients they are taking home.
In Spain, on the plain of La Mancha in the pumpkin season, I was led by the
nose to explore the kitchen and larder of a saffron grower whose front door
was ajar. She was toasting freshly plucked saffron on a hair sieve placed
over a wood-burning stove. An unmistakable smell. An irresistible lure. She
welcomed me in.
A rabbit caught in the garden that morning hung from a hook, its muzzle
neatly bandaged with gauze to staunch the blood. Bunches of grapes and
tomatoes on the vine hung from other hooks, drying in the autumn sun,
concentrating their sweetness for winter eating. There were shelves of
preserves and a row of pumpkins and squash in the process of curing.
She offered me an aromatic, freshly baked slice of pumpkin. Not the usual
crescent moon slice you might find elsewhere but the top slice or lid of a
pumpkin. She had brushed it with fat, she told me, sprinkled it with spices
and baked it cut side up with a sheet of foil laid over the top to protect
against burning. It smelled delicious and looked wonderful.
She had cut it like this for practical reasons - in order to fit the narrow
drawer-like oven at the bottom of her wood- burning stove. But the shallow
cup shape and the ribs of the pumpkin gave the impression of a prettily
fluted flan minus the pastry, a decorative idea I determined to copy.
Back in Wiltshire I bought a variety of colourful squashes with which to
indulge in kitchen experiments. I apologised to the shopper behind me for
holding up the queue with so many purchases. As good fortune would have it
she was intrigued by my selection and asked the name of one sort, pointing,
so she told me apologetically, with fingers stained from picking mulberries
most of the previous two days.
I pounced on her greedily, for mulberries are a magical fruit and impossible
to buy on the open market, too easily crushed to be commercial. Yet they
crop so heavily that anyone who has a mulberry tree tends to have more fruit
than they can cope with.
I was planning a figgy dessert, I explained, and I thought that vinous-rich
mulberrries might provide the perfect finishing touch. Any chance, I begged,
that she could let me have some. Kindly she agreed. Hence today's second
recipe.
GOLDEN NUGGET WITH GOAT'S CHEESE, TOMATOES &amp; THYME (serves 2-8)
Choose a flat rather than a ball-shaped squash if possible so that when cut
in half each half looks a little like a deep fluted flan tin. The
quiche-like filling is deliberately highly flavoured to foil the dense
chestnut quality of the flesh. Cut the halved squash into wedges (like a
pastry-less flan) for a first course for six to eight. Or allow one half
squash per person for a handsomely rustic supper (in this case the squash is
best eaten with a spoon).
Serve with good bread and a salad on the side.
1 golden nugget squash measuring about 5 1/2 -6 in in diameter; 2 oz Mendip
or chevre log goat's cheese; scant  1/4 oz butter; 1 egg; 2 1/2 fl oz single
cream; 2 1/2 fl oz double cream; 1-2 sun-dried tomatoes, drained of oil or
rinsed and dried if packed in salt; thyme and oregano or marjoram.
Cut the squash horizontally in half. Scoop out coarse fibres and seeds. Use
the tip of a knife to slash the hollows shallowly with criss-cross cuts. Rub
the hollows and the fleshy rims with butter.
Sit the squash, cut side up, in a baking dish or in individual oeuf sur le
plat dishes, propping them with wedges of bread as necessary to keep them
level and steady.
Cover loosely with a dome of foil and bake at 400'F (200'C) gas mark 6 for
30 minutes, brushing the rims with melted butter once or twice as they cook.
Beat the egg lightly and mix it with the creams. Snip the tomato(es) into
small pieces, add them to the creamy mixture and leave to soften while the
squash bakes. Then stir in the diced cheese, plenty of thyme, some oregano
and sea salt and black pepper to taste.
Carefully spoon the highly flavoured custard mixture into the hollows of the
squash and bake for 20-30 minutes more until the squash is perfectly tender
and the filling is softly set like a quiche-type custard. Serve warm, rather
than piping hot from the oven.
MEDIEVAL FRUIT FLAN (serves 8)
The ancient combination of saffron and honey, multi-seeded ripe black figs,
wine dark mulberries and handfuls of nuts make this a memorable dessert -
and it is simplicity itself to prepare if you cheat and buy a ready-made
sponge flan case. If you cannot lay hands on either mulberries or
blackberries, use one extra fig instead.
1 x 10 1/2 inch sponge flan case; 1 x 200 ml tub of creme fraiche;  1/4
teaspoon or so of orange flower water; 4 level tablespoons runny honey; a
good pinch of saffron; 4 very large ripe black figs; 4 oz ripe mulberries or
blackberries (optional); 1 oz pistacchio kernels (2 oz in the shell);  1/2
oz slivered almonds;  1/2 oz pine-nuts
Stand the jar of honey in a pan of hot water for at least 20 minutes so the
contents become very liquid. Meanwhile pound the saffron to a powder with
mortar and pestle, pour on 2-3 teaspoons boiling water and leave to infuse.
Shell the pistacchio nuts, and toast the almonds and pinenuts in a fatless
frying pan over low heat.
Beat the orange flower water into the creme fraiche. When smoothly blended
spread the creamy mixture over the flan base. Slice the figs and lay them,
just overlapping, over the cream. Scatter with berries and sprinkle with
nuts.
Measure the honey carefully into a small bowl that has been warmed by
rinsing it out with hot water. (If you do not have a standard tablespoon (15
ml) measuring spoon, use a tableware dessertspoon - as the capacity of
tableware spoons tends to be much greater than that of measuring spoons, and
too much honey will make the flan oversweet.) Stir the saffron into the
honey and drizzle the mixture over the fruit and nut filled flan.
Leave until cold before serving with a bowl of soured cream or creme
fraiche.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Food and Drink: First, catch your (Maine) lobster . . . -
Eating out / Nicholas Woodsworth's worthwhile struggle with steaming
crustaceans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lobsters, I decided sitting back one evening and surveying my shell-strewn,
butter-spattered table at the Dolphin Marina Restaurant, are hard work.
I should have guessed as much when they began handing out foul-weather gear.
Disposable plastic bibs are de rigueur for lobster-eaters in even the more
sophisticated seafood establishments in America - in some places motherly
waitresses will tie them on for you.
Then came the specialised equipment - the pincers for cracking claws, the
long skewers for probing recessed corners, the bowls for rinsing. It was all
new to me. I felt like a trainee dentist.
And what about the vast expertise required? How much experience, how many
botched jobs does it take before the seasoned lobsterer can artfully
dismember this complex little crustacean? I watched one man at the table
beside me deftly remove the meat from his lobster's tail with one clean
pull. There was hardly a drop of juice splattered on his bib. My own chest
looked like a Jackson Pollock painting. You could have made Thermidor with
what lay in my lap.
And is it, in the end, worth it? After the first bite I could only say yes,
it most certainly is. But lobsters, sadly, do not come cheap. Here, on the
Maine coast, home of what are said to be the best cold-water lobsters in the
world, the pound-and-a-half beast I had just consumed cost Dollars 20. Try
eating the same creature in some up-scale restaurant in a western European
capital, though, and you might have to pay for it by instalments. All in
all, I decided, the lobster-lover's lot is a hard one.
'Just about as tough eating a lobster as it is catching one,' I remarked to
the young waitress who, as I mopped melted butter from my eyebrows, had
begun cleaning up the battlefield in front of me. It was only the happy
prattle that comes after a good dinner, of course, but she seemed to take it
literally.
She looked at me, looked out the window at a wind-whipped sea and boats
tossing at their moorings, then back at me again.
'Get real, will ya?' she said.
I decided, the very next day, to get real. My waitress had been right - much
as I liked lobster, I hadn't the faintest idea of how easy or difficult it
was to catch one. All I knew was that they were lured into large crate-like
traps. But no one visiting Casco Bay, east of Portland, could avoid knowing
that; most people here make their living from lobstering and traps sit in
every backyard and on every wharf in sight. It should not be too difficult,
I thought, to get as close to a snapping live lobster as a steaming red one.
On Cook's wharf, 20 minutes drive from the Dolphin Restaurant on Orr's
Island, I came across hundreds of lobsters scuttling about the bottom of a
large holding tank. More importantly, I came across Ernest Hillman, the man
who caught them, and the Franny Ellen, the 36-ft lobster-boat he caught them
from.
Hillman was refuelling at the wharf's diesel pumps before heading out to
pull up 400 traps he had laid in 80 separate strings two days before. I
explained my interest in lobsters - not the ones already swimming in butter
but those still crawling about on the bottom of Harpswell Sound, the broad
Casco Bay channel that stretched away in front of us. Could I come along, I
asked? Why not, replied Hillman, he had something to tell me.
We shoved off with Hillman at the wheel and his two deckhands, Joe and
Chris, sorting out cases of baitfish in the stern. A purpose-built
lobster-boat, the Franny Ellen carries a large tank of pump-circulated
sea-water and a platform for traps on her aft deck; there is not much
working space left over.
'Better ride with me in the wheel-house', Hillman warned as we headed into
the sound. 'Once the ropes start paying out it gets kind of hairy back there
 -you get your foot caught in a coil of rope and all of a sudden you'll find
yourself being dragged 80ft down on a string of traps. We lose one or two
men that way every year.' I rode, very happily, in the wheelhouse.
For a layman like me it was a perfect day; the wind of the previous evening
had dropped and we cruised out into a sunny, calm, scintillatingly clear
autumn morning. In this weather the thousands of coloured lobster buoys that
cluttered the sound - each one marking the beginning or end of a string of
traps - stood out brightly against the deep blue water.
For a lobsterman like Hillman, though, the day was less than perfect. It was
full moon, he explained, a phase that created huge tides rising and falling
more than 15 feet in Casco Bay. With strong currents like that running, he
said, lobsters tend not to wander round in search of food but to stay put in
holes and depressions on the floor.
We came to a floating buoy marking one of Hillman's strings. His buoys are
black and orange, the other 30 or so lobstermen he fishes Harpswell Sound
with having their own colour combinations. Nonetheless, with some 12,000
traps out in the sound, locating one's own dispersed strings in this
multi-coloured maze - and not tangling them up with a neighbour's  -
requires a prodigious memory and skill.
The first string, as Hillman predicted, was disappointing. Winding the rope
attached to his bouy around a hydraulic winch, he began hauling in his
string of five traps. Each held three or four antenna-weaving,
tail-flapping, greeny-brown camouflaged lobsters; all but one, however, had
to be thrown back.
'Too small', Hillman explained, measuring each carefully with a brass
lobster gauge. Take anything measuring less than 3 1/4 in from eye to end of
body carapace and you loose your licence for three years. Take a female with
eggs and you are in real trouble. For every 100 lobsters I catch I keep only
about 20.'
As Hillman hauled traps, Joe rebaited them, sewing in two or three bait-fish
carefully trussed in nylon mesh. While the quaint lobster pots of the past -
knotted cord mounted on light frames of steamed wood - have long been
replaced by metal traps, the principle remains the same: lured by a
decomposing fish, the victim makes his way through a progressively smaller
aperture until, once inside, he cannot find his way out.
I began to understand Hillman's warning after Chris had all five rebaited
traps lined up on the Franny Ellen's stern. As he threw the first one
overboard Hillman hit the gas and 600 feet of rope and 75lb traps began
paying out at high speed. When you have to haul anything up to 750 traps a
day you do not waste time.
As he worked, Hillman talked. He is the quintessential Yankee Down-easter -
tough, resilient, enterprising and hard-working. He grew up on Casco Bay and
began lobster-fishing when he was 12 years old. In the 1970s a hurricane
sank his boat and he had to fight hard to get back into what is an expensive
business - a lobster-boat these days costs upward of Dollars 60,000, a
single trap Dollars 75. But Hillman loves boats and fishing; they are only
thing he knows.
He surprised me, then, by asking if I wouldn't like to become the owner of
the Franny Ellen and all the gear that goes with her. I would not even have
to buy her. All I would have to do was win her.
Why? I asked. Six months ago, it turned out, a pile of lobster traps fell on
Hillman, damaging his spine and injuring an arm. He is fast reaching the end
of his trap-hauling days. When he put the Franny Ellen up for sale he
received a number of offers from young fishermen, deckhands wanting to start
up on their own. But lobster-fishing is a risky business: while some
skippers are in the six-figure income bracket, many more go bankrupt. None
of Hillman's prospective buyers could come up with the bank loans they
needed.
Hillman's solution? He has set up an essay competition. If he can attract
2,000 contestants each paying an entrance fee of Dollars 50, he says, he can
recoup the value of his business. He walks away with the entry money, and
the writer of the best essay, to be independently judged, walks away with
his boat, 750 traps and 14 miles of rope. The essay topic? Fishing, of
course - 250 words of finely-honed prose on Ernest Hillman's favourite
subject.
The morning wore on and slowly the tank on the Franny Ellen's deck filled
with lobsters. In the end it turned out to be not too bad a catch: at Cook's
wharf we off-loaded about 300 of the little brutes, each with their claws
carefully strapped tight with a pair of bright yellow elastic bands.
Later, flying home, I day-dreamed about those lobsters. I had no difficulty
imagining them flying off, like me, to distant destinations. In my mind's
eye I could see them roaming about restaurant display tanks in New York,
diving into boiling vats of water in Rome, swimming through Newburg sauce on
dinner plates in Paris. And, if I closed my eyes and thought very hard
indeed, I could see them in a trap on the deck of my very own lobster boat
in Maine.
Readers interested in Ernest Hillman's essay contest may contact him on tel:
(207) 833 6010 or fax (207) 833 5956. Deadline for essay entries must be
postmarked on or before October 15.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Food and Drink: Wineupmanship, beating the bores -
Entertaining at home / Jancis Robinson on safe bottles for the pickiest of
dinner guests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In my experience, the more wine expertise someone claims, the less they
generally have. Only a beginner would claim to know a lot about wine; those
of us who have spent a couple of decades immersed in the subject are only
too painfully aware of how much more there is to learn.
People with a little wine knowledge tend to wear it heavily. My heart always
sinks, for instance, when someone begins a conversation with 'In my cellar .
. .'. It is difficult enough to make a discussion about the wine in your
glass interesting, let alone one about someone else's firmly corked bottles.
I sympathise, therefore, with anyone required to entertain those who claim
to know something about wine. Will the choice of bottles reveal one as an
irredeemable cheapskate or vinous lowbrow?
As so often, the solution is not necessarily to throw money at the problem.
Very, very few wine merchants' most expensive bottles are anything like
ready to drink (exceptions include: Reid Wines, of Hallatrow, near Bristol;
La Vigneronne of London W7; and Butlers Wine Cellar, of Brighton, Sussex).
The answer is to show flair, wineupmanship, and spend less, by choosing some
hot, new (or revived) wine types.
The insider's whistle-whetting aperitif, for example, is top quality
Riesling, preferably a Mosel Kabinett from a quality-conscious producer
(which is unlikely to cost much more than Pounds 7).
The VDP symbol on the label or capsule is a shorthand way of identifying
Germany's goodies, a very high proportion of which belong to the VDP group
of superior estates.
Merchants who take German wine seriously include: Oddbins, O W Loeb of
London SE1; Philip Eyres, of Amersham, Bucks; Harcourt Fine Wines, of London
W1; Adnams, of Southwold, Suffolk; Summerlee Wines, of Earls Barton,
Northamptonshire (0604-810488); Lay &amp; Wheeler, of Colchester, Essex; and The
Wine Society, of Stevenage, Herts.
Acceptable alternatives include one of the host of Australian Rieslings now
being shipped, faute de Chardonnay, to the UK or a dry Riesling from Alsace.
Lea &amp; Sandeman, of London SW10, has the superb wines of Marcel Deiss, and
Wine Rack stores have made a particularly diligent selection.
One clever dry, fuller-bodied white and one red should be enough for most
meals - although you could always demonstrate your savoir boire by serving a
sweet wine with the cheese such as a Moelleux version of Jurancon or
Pacherenc de Vic Bilh, an Italian Moscato with an alcohol of at least 12 per
cent, or even (tres chic) an Austrian Beerenauslese (try Noel Young of
Trumpington, Cambridgeshire, for the fabulous wines of Kracher).
Chardonnay-based wines dominate dinner tables the world over. Much more
distinguished at the moment are full, dry whites based on Rhone Valley
varieties. Viognier is so sought after it is almost passe. Rostaing's 1992
version at Pounds 9.99 from Bottoms Up and Wine Rack is much meatier than
most, and few wines are more outre than Guffens' Ardeche 'Fruits Defendus'
oddity which is not allowed to call itself Viognier but fetches Pounds 8.13
at Laytons of London NW1 (and try Andre Simon shops).
A more gifted choice would be a well-made wine based on one or both of the
white Hermitage grapes Marsanne or Roussanne.
Ch de Beaucastel of Chateauneuf-du-Pape has produced an exciting old-vine
Roussanne for years now. A more inspired choice might be the intriguingly
packaged Sophiste, from Bonny Doon, of California. This blend of Marsanne
and Roussanne has the elegance that so much white Hermitage lacks and the
1993 vintage is expected soon by Morris &amp; Verdin at their new address in
London SE1 (071-357 8866). It will be about Pounds 17.50 a bottle - not
cheap but a real thrill.
Another impressive Rhone Ranger white, as the Californians call them, is
Jade Mountain's Marsanne/Viognier 1993, Pounds 9.90 from Morris &amp; Verdin.
Rather less expensive but with an interesting tang is a white Minervois
based on old Marsanne vines, Ch de Violet 1993 which Thresher Wine
Shops/Wine Rack/Bottoms Up have been selling for Pounds 4.99. Australia can
also provide some Marsanne, which should usually be drunk as young as
possible. Pioneer exporters of Victorian Marsanne were Ch Tahbilk and
Mitchelton (chez Sainsbury's), the latter now part of Petaluma's expanding
empire.
Wine Rack also has an interestingly smoky, substantial, oak-aged Catalonian
Malvoisie, probably the same grape variety as Sardinia's Torbato, at Pounds
6.49 a bottle.
The red wine possibilities for stunning a wine bore are much wider. The
Rhone can again provide, particularly in the form of the less famous
appellations. Crozes-Hermitage can now be a serious wine, from the cellars
of the likes of Graillot and Belle (see Lay &amp; Wheeler and Oddbins) or,
another Rhone from Syrah grapes, you could even buy the earthy red Brezeme
from Yapp Bros, of Mere, Wiltshire and confound with obscurity.
But I would be inclined to head out of France altogether and pick an Italian
plum from Winecellars of Wandsworth, London SW18 or Valvona &amp; Crolla, of
Edinburgh. The nice thing about Italian fanatics is that they advise while
proselytising.
A fine Ribeira del Duero, such as Pesquera (from John Armit Wines, of London
W11) would also impress with its demonstration of insider knowledge.
Both these wine styles need reasonably chewy, assertive food, however. If
you are planning a subtler main course, a West Coast Pinot Noir from the
particularly fine selection of The Wine Treasury of Fulham Road, London SW6
is guaranteed to delight.
They have such gorgeous California Pinot Noirs as Williams &amp; Selyem (a tiny
allocation), Olivet Lane and Kistler, and the extremely convincing Christom,
regular and Reserve, from Oregon.
The Chilean Cono Sur regular Pinot Noir bottling at Pounds 4.49 from Oddbins
and Safeway is less serious, but its quality should fascinate anyone with
half an interest in wine.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Travel: Renaissance flowers again in Florence - Derek Wilson
enjoys 20th century comfort in 16th century surroundings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For years, visitors to Florence have opted to inspect the Renaissance by day
and to give it a miss by night, preferring to sleep in comfort rather than
rough it in some derelict 16th century palazzo without hot water.
Change is afoot. You can now sleep the Renaissance as well as see it - and
in comfort.
A small group of hoteliers has pioneered the restoration of Renaissance
properties to make them suitable for the most choosy tourist. In so doing,
they have resisted the cheap - and easy - path of wholesale conversion of
buildings which has been followed by all but a handful of the 359 hotels in
Florence.
Four have chosen the hard way. In each case, family pride has been a
principal reason. Encouragement, too, came from the Florence town council,
which has a new policy aimed at making greater use of historic buildings.
All the emphasis in these four instances has been on re-creating the
physical setting of the Renaissance, with less regard for other matters such
as food. Only one, in fact, has a restaurant, although all four provide
lavish breakfasts.
The most spectacular is Torre di Bellosguardo, a big, sturdy 16th century
villa on a hill beyond the Arno. 'I simply wanted to save the place,' says
Amerigo Franchetti, the owner. He says that 180 day-school pupils used to
arrive at 8am and wreak destruction. 'I had to get rid of them. In another
five years they would have wrecked the lot.'
The core of the hotel is a stumpy tower built perhaps as a hunting lodge
before 1300 by Guido Cavalcanti, poet of courtly love, and a friend of
Dante. Later confiscated from the Medici, it passed to the land-owning Roti
Michelozzi family who much later ceded it to Franchetti's romantic
grandmother.
'She was a German from Munich called Marion Hornstein. She took one look at
this place and decided it was the abode of her dreams and all that rot,'
says the owner. 'She married an Italian. Then my father told her one day in
1913: 'If you like this place so much, here's the money'. He'd married into
the Rothschilds, Paris branch. When she died in 1948, the family let it to
finishing schools, then to that terrible day-school.'
The restorers took 10 years. Already the high facade is peeling, but inside
the building wallows in space: a mirror of spartan Tuscan luxury. Reception
is a table in a great ball-room frescoed by one Bernardino Poccetti, a
prolific 16th century hack. The music-room boasts a fine sculpted
chimney-piece and is bare; a stone ramp does for stairs; canopied beds,
sticks of medieval furniture and coats-of-arms in huge rooms complete the
feeling, as do aged carpets.
Frigo-bars and TV sets have been banned and superb bathrooms are ingeniously
dissimulated. Concealing the swimming-pool in gardens ablaze with flowers
proved a tougher proposition.
A friend of Franchetti's, Rodolfo Budini Gattai, runs what was a guest-house
for clerics built in 1518. Discreetly tucked away under the arches of the
very central Piazza della Santissima Annunziata, this is the Loggiato dei
Serviti. It faces Brunelleschi's Spedale degli Innocenti, the foundlings'
hospital, and was included in the matching portico designed by Antonio da
Sangallo.
The fathers kept their lodgings for visiting prelates. They were clearly
well-heeled since the rooms are commodious chambers: you wake up to Tuscan
coffered ceilings and lofty ribbed vaulting.
'My family bought the Loggiato in 1870 after the confiscation of church
property', says Gattai. 'At first it was rented out as flats, but in 1924 my
grandmother's coachman was allowed to open a boarding-house here. Well, he
married an Irish lady, one Katherine Doyle, and in the 1930s their pensione
was popular with the English and Irish. I and my brothers took over in 1984.
We wanted to resurrect the original.'
The most stylish of the four is the Monna Lisa in nearby Borgo Pinti - a
superbly preserved 15th century patrician dwelling set around a small
courtyard with a garden in the back. The dominant artist on display is
Giovanni Dupre, a 19th century Sienese sculptor whose descendents own the
place. Oslavia Ciardi Dupre bought out the Marzichi-Lenzi family, its owners
for generations, in 1956.
At the Monna Lisa, Florentine good taste comes with a touch of clutter:
there is Dupre family treasure scattered about, including five centuries' of
furniture and a plaster model by Giambologna for his Rape of the Sabines in
Piazza della Signoria. There is a tasteful restaurant amid pillars and
pictures.
Cheaper is the oddly-named Aprile, near the station. It is as Renaissance as
they come, a pugnacious three-storey clan fortress with huge eaves and no
nonsense. Once known as the Palazzo dei Medici, and then as Palazzo del
Borgo, this is a warren of a place with a lived-in feel to it. The old
structure survives intact, bumps, wasted space, crannies and all, each one
deftly exploited.
'My family has been there since 1815,' says Marcella Ascoli-Bollaffi. 'We
were textile merchants. I was born there and my mother stayed on until the
'50s.' Why Aprile? 'Oh, I was young and silly and when we let it to the
Cantini Zucconi family 40 years ago, I let them call it after the month they
moved in. I've regretted it ever since.'

FT  08 OCT 94 / Travel: Moules and masterpieces - Susan Moore worships at
the altars of art and food in Bruges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A larger than life Jan Van Eyck, brush and palette in one hand and beloved
bagpipe by his side, presides over the small square by our hotel.
We breakfast on strawberries piled in blue and white bowls lifted out of a
17th century still life, marvel at Michelangelo, take deep draughts of
Memling and blond beer tasting like nectar, and dine robustly in the house
of the Renaissance painter Pieter Pourbus.
From day one it is clear that Bruges is a place to worship at the twin
altars of high art and the soon-to-expand stomach.
For this is a city where moules comes by the four-litre pan, extra frites
are offered as a matter of course, and every cup of coffee comes accompanied
by a chocolate. And Bruges at table is so like Bruges in the street.
Streetscapes of canals and crow-stepped gables have earned it the reputation
of the Venice of the North, but there is none of the Serenissima's faded
splendour or aristocratic hauteur. Bruges is unashamedly bourgeois:
prosperous, spic and span and polite. In this heavily restored Venice, there
are no surly waiters or good food only if you know where to find it. Here
geraniums in window boxes adorn even the inside of canal walls.
Bruges is as pretty as any picture and, oddly enough, comparably
two-dimensional. Like its alter ego, it is awash with tourists in season
but, unlike it, there seems no escape from the crowds or the lace shops.
Strolling along cobbled streets past ornate, once-medieval public buildings
and soft domestic red brick, it seems a city of facades but few interiors.
It almost would not surprise me to discover that the whole place was an
ingeniously constructed film-set.
There are, however, at least three glorious places of refuge. The spartan
interior of the Onze Lieve Vrouwekerk - more familiarly Notre Dame, but here
Flemish, even English, is preferred to French - boasts the sumptuous
gilt-bronze Renaissance mausoleums of Charles the Bold and his daughter Mary
of Burgundy; visible beneath them, thanks to judiciously placed mirrors,
their original narrow tombs, gauchely painted red and black like early wood
cuts.
Here, too, is the Michelangelo, a pensive marble Madonna seated on a rock,
the standing Christ-child, eyes cast down, nestling between her legs and
clasping his mother's left hand. Her mournful sadness is heart-rending.
The sculpture was made for Siena Cathedral but sold instead to the Mouscron
family of Bruges. We were not supposed to view it head on, as currently
aligned - the evidence is the cut of the marble. Stand way to the left to
see it at its best.
St James's Church was the original location for the Moreel altarpiece by the
far from 'Primitive' Hans Memling, a triptych which not only includes
portraits of the donor Willem Moreel and his wife but their five sons and 11
daughters.
Memling is the city's greatest adoptive son who left his native Rhineland to
pursue a lucrative career in cosmopolitan Bruges in 1465. St John's
Hospital, now the Memling Museum, still lays claim to handful of his
masterpieces.
The Groeningemuseum (which is host to a major Memling exhibition, until
November 15) also boasts Jan Van Eyck's wondrous 'Virgin and Child with
Canon van der Paele'. But then, one of the great advantages of visiting
Bruges is that Ghent is only 20 minutes away by train. There, in St Baaf's
Cathedral, locked in bullet, earthquake and everything-proof glass is Jan
and Hubert Van Eyck's 'Adoration of the Mystic Lamb', the most sublime
evocation of heavenly paradise ever painted. That was our ambrosial lunch,
and there was plenty of time to get back before dinner.
The author travelled from Ramsgate to Ostend by Sally Lines jetfoil
(reservations 0843-595522) and stayed at the 18th century Relais Oud-huis
Amsterdam in Bruges (tel: 050-34 18 10). The crossing takes 1hr 40 mins. The
train direct from the port of Ostend to Bruges takes 12 minutes.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Shooting in the heat of battle -
David Spark talks to a cameraman who specialises in frontline film
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SPARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vaughan Smith was the only television cameraman to get frontline film of the
allied advance in the Gulf War. He posed as an officer taking pictures for
the British army, sat undetected while officers were warned about an
unauthorised intruder, then left to hitch a lift with US troops, claiming
they had crashed into his Land Rover.
Smith is a former captain in the Grenadier Guards. His Gulf War earnings
enabled him to finance the development of Frontline News TV, which started
out as a cameramen's co-operative and has provided much of the world's TV
coverage of Bosnia, Somalia and Liberia.
Its scoops include Rory Peck's Gulf War pictures of a missile-hit air-raid
shelter in Baghdad, and the story of UN soldiers in Sarajevo trading on the
black market and buying people's few belongings.
Eighteen months before the Gulf war, Smith, who used to fly microlight
aircraft, went to Pakistan to represent a company that made the aircraft and
joined a camera crew accompanying the BBC's John Simpson over the mountains
to Kabul. The other members of the crew were Peck and Peter Jouvenal, a
former soldier, on the trip they discussed setting up a company. The
following year, after the Romanian revolution, they set up the Hard News
group, later renamed Frontline News TV, with Nick della Casa and Tim Weaver.
Freelance cameramen may take exciting pictures but they struggle to sell
them. For individuals the problem is making themselves known to TV
companies.
'It's hard to do enough for them to remember you,' says Smith.
Freelances rarely figure in the credits at the end of TV programmes.
Companies normally try to disguise the fact that they are using non-staff
pictures. The idea of Frontline was to establish a name which companies
would remember.
Smith ran the group from his London home and cycled round TV offices
delivering material. The first year was difficult. The group had a Pounds
50,000 turnover but did not make money.
Smith's Gulf earnings enabled him to buy computers, set up a data base of
clients and sales, and improve the presentation of material to TV
executives. He also spent Pounds 50,000 on an editing suite, which saved
money and time. Annual turnover rose to Pounds 180,000.
Towards the end of 1991, Anna Roberts, a journalist and producer, joined the
group to market the cameraman's material and built the number of TV clients
to 70. Roberts became a camerawoman and producer and, in early 1993,
Frontline hired first Susannah Nicoll and then Jane Birch to organise sales,
seek contracts and run the office. Annual turnover has reached Pounds
400,000, partly because the cameramen became better at choosing what to do
and doing it, partly because of work in Bosnia.
The Frontline group was among the first users of Hi8 home video cameras for
TV instead of the heavy and expensive Betacam. 'People picked up Hi8s and
went to war zones and came back with footage that sold,' says Smith. Hi8s
have become standard on BBC World Service TV.
After the Gulf War, della Casa was murdered by his guide in Kurdistan.
Weaver left the group to work on his own. Peck also left to set up an office
in Moscow. He was killed in the battle at the TV station when the Russian
parliament challenged Boris Yeltsin.
Last May, Smith and Jouvenal changed Frontline News into a limited company,
with five share or share-option holders, all camera-people who work almost
exclusively for Frontline. The aim is to keep ownership in the hands of the
people who do the work.
Camera-people working with Frontline take responsibility for themselves and
their equipment and pay Frontline a commission. They may offer features
lasting six to 12 minutes to TV companies; or they may go overseas as camera
crew for the networks. Smith says: 'We have a reputation for war coverage
and getting to places that are difficult to get to.'
To attract networks, a freelance group has to be cheaper than a staff crew
and yet also meet its running costs from within its fee. 'That means being
highly competitive and motivated. The very fact we have survived shows
flexibility and motivation.'
A BBC cameraman in Bosnia goes to war in an armoured car. Frontline cannot
afford that. Its people probably stay with a family in Sarajevo for Dollars
20 (Pounds 12.60) a night, instead of paying Dollars 80 at the Holiday Inn.
Smith stresses, however, that freelances play an important role because of
their freedom from head office. 'We can do what most broadcasters sometimes
don't do, because we aren't controlled.'
For example, he could get frontline pictures of the Gulf because he was
outside the deal between editors and the British Army. Other journalists
could have broken the story of the Sarajevo Mafia and UN corruption; but
they were staying in the Holiday Inn and benefiting from Mafia-provided
power, water and food.
One thing which rankles with Smith is that freelances rarely win awards. The
networks give them to each other.

FT  08 OCT 94 / FT Ski Expedition: The little resort on Alloway Street -
Arnie Wilson visits Mount Dobson in New Zealand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition.
At 5.30 in the morning, No 30 Altoway Street, Fairlie, can be resemble
Nightmare on Elm Street. Facsimile machines suddenly whir automatically,
sending messages to all corners of New Zealand's South Island. Telephones
ring. Answering machines are triggered all over the house.
At 6 am, a cuckoo clock cuckoos maniacally. The answer machine message
echoes down the corridor: 'Conditions above the valley cloud are clear and
calm. All facilities are operating. There are 2 cm of new snow on a
2.3-metre base. The main runs are groomed, and there's excellent skiing on
packed powder. Chains are required today.'
It is the start of another day in the life of Mount Dobson ski resort,
south-west of Christchurch in the Southern Alps.
Peter and Shirley Foote prefer to start their hectic day from base camp
rather than at 5,500 ft. Shirley records two messages every morning in her
nightie and triggers the fax machine on its helter-skelter visit to various
radio and television stations, sports shops, hotels and lodges.
Peter organises staff on the mountains via a short-wave radio and then
readies himself for the 15-mile journey there. (While he is doing this, the
cuckoo clock - a present from a German coach driver who escorted them on a
whistle-stop tour of Europe recently - cuckoos seven times).
Few people run ski resorts from their front room, and even fewer simply go
out and build their own resort on a virginal mountain. The Footes did it the
hard way 15 years ago, becoming involved in a bitter battle with
bureaucracy.
'It took us three years just to build the road,' says Foote. 'They wanted us
to build more and more culverts. We ended up building 70. Every time we
acquiesced over something, they came back with more red tape. We had to take
it. It was either just walk away, leaving the resort half-built, or keep on
battling.
'Luckily, there were a lot of people who wanted us to succeed as much as the
local authorities wanted us to fail. Our solicitors, bank manager and the
contractors all said they would wait for their money.'
The result is one of the best privately-owned ski fields in New Zealand. It
is on good powder days that it really comes into its own. After some
unsettled weather, we were due for a good day. We got it at Mt Dobson, our
200th ski area of the expedition.
Higher than many of New Zealand's ski fields, the ungroomed terrain can stay
light for days. Lucy and I trudged to the very top of the mountain from the
highest lift and were greeted with astonishing scenery.
Spread all around us, in a gigantic arc, was the cream of the Southern Alps
 -reputedly more wide-ranging than those in Europe - and with Mt Cook
dominating the skyline.
At the end of a magnificent day we skied down the front face of Mt Dobson,
which gave us 3,500 vertical feet of non-stop powder. It was the kind of run
you dream about: turn after effortless turn, with no end in sight and no
need to change direction. Just straight down forever.
We felt guilty about those 70 conduits, all built by hand by the Footes. Red
tape or not, without them we would have missed one of the most exhilarating
descents of our nine months on skis. For each conduit, we had the
satisfaction of at least 110 exquisite turns.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: CGT need not be paid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Where a holding of shares included in a person's estate shows a considerable
capital gain, is this deducted from the value of the shares (less exemption
Pounds 5,800) for inheritance tax purposes?
Alternatively, if the shares are willed to a beneficiary, is the liability
for CGT also transferred?
The answer to both questions is no.
Capital gains tax on death was abolished in 1971 (although there is an
income tax charge on death in respect of those types of capital gain which
are treated as income). Ask your tax office for the free leaflet IR45 (What
happens when someone dies).

FT  08 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Random and arbitrary?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As an investing member of several building societies, I was unaware that if
my share account had not been open for two years, I would lose out on
rewards or advantages that depositors (rather than shareholders) would get.
I have received a letter from the Cheltenham and Gloucester building society
telling me that, as my share account was not open by December 31 1992, I
shall not qualify legally for payment in the distribution of the Pounds
1.8bn cash bid from Lloyds Bank. On the other hand, depositors qualify if
their accounts were opened by March 31 1994. This appears to me to be a
random and arbitrary decision.
The letter from the C&amp;G resulted from a High Court action interpreting the
legislation regarding take-overs of building societies.
The decision to restrict payments to those who have been with the society
for a minimum of two years is not without precedent and is certainly not
random and arbitrary.
You might wish to know that the C&amp;G has opened a telephone help-line which
can be contacted on 0345-889 900 from 9am to 5pm Mondays to Fridays, and 9-1
on Saturdays. (Reply by Barry Stillerman of Stoy Hayward).

FT  08 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Making money from options
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I am considering dipping a toe in the traded options market with a view to
increasing the returns from my equity investments.
1. What is the tax position in relation to the selling of 'puts and covered
calls'?
2. Is the profit from buying puts and calls classed as capital gains?
3. Can the losses sustained be set against capital gains for tax?
We take it you are talking about LIFFE equity options only. (If we are wrong
in this assumption, please come back to us with details of the precise
traded options in which you are interested, because the tax rules for some
traded options are different from those outlined below).
The answer to both questions 2 and question 3 is yes.
As for question 1:
(a) Selling an option which expires unassigned. The net premium received is
treated as a capital gain which arose on the day the option was sold. (There
is no indexation relief).
(b) Selling an option and making a closing purchase. The net profit or loss
is treated as a capital gain or an allowable loss which arose on the day on
which the option was sold. (There is no indexation relief).
(c) Selling a put option which is assigned. The net premium received is
treated as reducing the cost of the shares put. (Indexation relief on the
eventual sale of the shares put is calculated on this reduced cost; the
shares put are treated as having been bought on the day on which you are
given notice of assignment).
(d) Selling a call option which is assigned. The net premium received is
treated as part of the proceeds of sale of the shares called. (Any
indexation relief on the cost of the shares called is calculated up to the
day on which the notice of assignment is given, and the consequent capital
gain is treated as arising on that day.
If there is an allowable loss, there is no indexation relief, of course, but
transitional relief (up to the Pounds 10,000 limit for 1993-94 and 1994-95
together) would be available for notices of assignment given before April 6
1995).
Ask your broker, or LIFFE's publications department, for the free Private
Investor's Guide to the Taxation of LIFFE Equity Options. (It was written
after publication of the Finance Bill last January, but before the CGT rules
were amended at the report stage in April).

FT  08 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: No pay slips from employer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have been in my first job for 2 1/2 years and I am paid weekly by cheque
with no supporting documentation.
I have recently become aware that my employer should provide pay slips
showing gross pay, deductions and net pay.
My employer says I am not on pay-as-you-earn, so no deductions have been
made for income tax or National Insurance and I have, unwittingly, become
liable for arrears. What steps should I take to regularise my position?
It could be that your pay is below the National Insurance and Paye
thresholds, in which case you have nothing to worry about. But we suggest
you talk things over with, say, someone at a Citizens Advice Bureau.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I understand that shares in Rosehaugh plc were suspended about 18 months ago
but my inspector seems unable to agree a date on which they become
negligible value. For indexation of capital gains loss, it is important that
they be so declared before November 1993. Have you any information?
Your letter is based upon a misapprehension: it is irrelevant, for
indexation loss purposes, whether 'they be so declared before November (30)
1993'. It is the day on which your negligible-value claim is made that is
important.
If it is made after November 29 1993 but before April 6 1995,
indexation-loss relief will be due (up to the Pounds 10,000 limit for
1993-94 and 1994-95 together) either statutorily, if you make a statutory
claim under section 24(2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, or
extra-statutorily, if you make a claim under extra-statutory concession D28
(Asset of negligible value) as revised on May 31 this year.
Ask your tax office for a copy of D28, which should help to clarify the
position.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have noted your periodic advice about establishing losses on shares of
negligible value; however, I assume this applies only to quoted shares. What
is the position, please, concerning unquoted shares?
There is no difference in principle between quoted shares (or shares which
had been quoted before the price collapsed) and shares which have never had
a quotation.
The difference in practice is merely that it is usually easier for a
shareholder to establish the facts for a public company, without having to
submit documentary evidence of the shareholding's negligible value.

<TEXT>
Now that the take-over of Confederation UK Holdings plc by Sun Life of
Canada has received regulatory approval, Confederation Bank makes a return
to the Highest Rates table with its market-leading Tessa (tax-exempt special
savings account) of 9 per cent, fixed for five years.
Building societies are slowly filtering increases through to their savers.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester is the largest society to announce new rates so far,
with increases of up to 0.4 per cent.
Northern Rock has re-opened its Go Direct account. Although the account must
be opened by post, cheques may be deposited and withdrawn from branches
after that.
Fixed rates continue to be in favour. Leeds and Newcastle have both launched
new fixed products. Norwich and Peterborough has increased rates on all its
fixed products; it now pays up to 8.55 per cent on a three-year bond. The
market leader for three years remains Coventry at 9.10 per cent.
For those requiring gross interest, rates offshore are also slowly
increasing on ordinary accounts. The majority of banks have increased rates
but the only building society subsidiary to increase has been C&amp;G Channel
Islands Ltd. Confederation Bank (Jersey) Ltd returns with its Flexible
Investment account.
Guaranteed income bonds also continue a gradual rise. Eurolife went up to
7.75 per cent on a five-year bond to lead this week, only to be leap-frogged
by Laurentian Life paying 7.85 per cent and then by Liberty Life, with rates
up to 8.25 per cent (10.31 per cent to a basic-rate taxpayer) at Pounds
50,000.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: When 'top rate' means 45% - David
Cohen reveals how changes to the treatment of dividends are driving up tax
bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ask the Inland Revenue and it will tell you that the top rate of income tax
is 40 per cent. The truth, however, is that some taxpayers now face a
marginal rate of 45 per cent because of last year's changes to the tax
treatment of dividends.
Every dividend cheque is accompanied by a voucher giving a tax credit. On
April 6 1993, the value of this credit was cut from 25 to 20 per cent of the
gross payment. So, someone receiving an Pounds 80 dividend now gets a Pounds
20 credit, which is 20 per cent of Pounds 100 (the dividend and credit
combined).
Basic-rate taxpayers have been protected against the impact of this change.
They are now taxable at only 20 per cent on their dividend income, so the 20
per cent credit still takes full care of their liability. But 40 per cent
taxpayers have lost out. They are stuck with the reduced credit - without
the benefit of a lower tax band.
The 45 per cent crunch comes for those individuals in the higher-rate
bracket who have a mix of dividends and other sources of income. The
dividends will be treated as the top slice when calculating overall
liability. Hence, the benefit of the special 20 per cent dividend rate will
be available only to the extent that the basic-rate band has not been
absorbed by the individual's non-dividend income.
Any increase in such income will, therefore, catapult an equivalent amount
of dividend income from 20 per cent straight up to 40 per cent.
Take Ezra, whose income comprises a Pounds 16,000 salary and Pounds 12,000
dividends. Ignoring personal allowances, his tax liabilities will be as set
out in Table 1. Table 2 shows the impact of a Pounds 5,000 salary increase.
Additional tax of Pounds 2,250 is 45 per cent of the extra income.
Having identified this trap, what can taxpayers do to avoid it? Many will
have little or no influence over their income level, and an employee offered
a pay rise is hardly likely to turn it down because it will be taxable at 45
per cent.
Nevertheless, those with more flexible arrangements often will be able to
take avoiding action. Owner-managers of private companies, for instance, can
keep the 45 per cent threat at bay by paying themselves extra dividends in
lieu of salary increases.
Equally, husbands and wives can swap ownership of income-producing assets if
one is a potential 45 per cent payer and the other is not.
David Cohen is a partner in the City law firm of Paisner &amp; Co.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Don't delay that will - Scheherazade
Daneshkhu explains the benefits of making proper provision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only one-third of UK adults have made a will. To spur the rest, Make a Will
week, an annual promotion organised by the Law Society, starts on Monday,
October 17.
Married people tend to assume everything will pass to their spouse when they
die - but this is not always so, as the chart shows.
In broad terms, if you die without a will and leave an estate worth more
than Pounds 125,000 (in England and Wales), it will be divided between your
spouse and children (sometimes parents if there are no children).
This can be a problem if much of the estate's value is concentrated in the
family home - the spouse might have to sell it to satisfy other claimants.
People who stand to lose most are unmarried partners who survive the person
with whom they lived. They have no rights under the intestacy laws although,
if they are a dependant, they may be able to claim through the courts.
There are three distinct elements in making a will:
Appointing executors to handle your affairs. Usually, these will be trusted
relatives or friends. If you die intestate, your next of kin will have to do
the job - even if they are reluctant at such an upsetting time.
Try to avoid appointing a professional, such as a solicitor or bank. They
are likely to be expensive and the family could find it difficult to control
them if it is unhappy with their service. A non-professional executor can
always appoint a solicitor to help, anyway. Prescribing powers for trustees.
If you have children under 18, you must have trustees to handle their
affairs - although the executors can fulfil this role. How much power the
trustees should have is for you to decide.
Distributing the property. This should be quite straightforward so long as
you have calculated the size of your estate and know where you want your
possessions to go. But remember to revise the will if your financial or
personal circumstances change significantly, or a beneficiary dies.
Where should you have the will drawn up? The options are wide, ranging from
a trip to the stationer for a do-it-yourself pack to a solicitor's office.
But research by the Consumers' Association - published this week in its
magazine, Which? - found that one in five wills was of poor quality, with
sloppy drafting.
The association suggests shopping around for quotations, working out figures
beforehand, and getting the person drafting the will to explain any jargon
they might use. Always check the will after it has been drafted.
Solicitors came out best in the survey. Of the 31 wills drawn up by them,
six were deemed good and 20 reasonable, but five were poor. Quality of
service can vary considerably and is not always related to how much you pay
 -anything between Pounds 23.50 and Pounds 117.50, according to the
association.
Solicitors also can guide you on inheritance tax but the costs for this will
push up the bill; ask for an estimate first. The best are likely to be found
through personal recommendation. If you are unhappy, you can turn to the
Solicitors Complaints Bureau*.
Banks and building societies. The main problem here is that most banks
insist on being named executor and, since their fee tends to be a fixed
percentage of the estate, they can be very expensive.
The survey found that of the 10 wills given to banks and building societies,
three were good, five reasonable and two poor. It also found incompetence
and lengthy delays in executing wills.
Will-writing services. Of the six firms surveyed by the association, four
produced poor wills while those from two others were no more than
reasonable. But these often are franchise operations and qualifications are
not needed to provide such a service. Moreover, they are unregulated - there
is no point of redress for unhappy clients.
Life insurance companies. Some of these, or independent financial advisers,
may offer 'free' will-writing services, but be wary - this could be a
marketing ploy to sell you something else.
The survey tried out only three life companies, however. Two drafted
reasonable wills. The third did not draft one after the client refused to
buy any life products.
Do-it-yourself packs. These may seem an easy option but you can miss out on
good advice, which could cause unnecessary complications after your death.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Hurry for a quick fix
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fixed-rate mortgages have been rising this year as the cost of borrowing on
the wholesale money markets has risen. But while a good number of fixed
rates remain available, Ian Darby, of mortgage-broker John Charcol, believes
they will disappear quickly.
'There is still a lot of old money in the markets, but new money priced on
the post-base rate rise is more expensive,' he says. 'I don't think the old
money will be around for more than another week.'
Five-year fixed rates of 6.99 per cent, available at the beginning of the
year, have given way to very resistable new offers. The latest, launched
this week, includes a three-year fixed rate of 9.5 per cent from Cheltenham
&amp; Gloucester; a four-year fix from Woolwich of 9.49 per cent; and a 4 1/2
 year fix (to February 28 1999) from Barclays bank at 9.75 per cent.
The table shows some of the better rates available, including five-year
fixes of 8.15 per cent from the Britannia and Lambeth building societies.
But you need deposits of 40 or 25 per cent respectively.
As long-term money becomes expensive, the choice for borrowers is likely to
be between a shorter-term fixed rate or a discounted variable rate.
Since interest levels are now on the way up, taking a short-term fix means
you can be relatively sure you will not be undercut by lower mortgage rates.
The standard variable rate is now just over 8 per cent so the two-year, 4.95
per cent fix from Charcol looks attractive.
Always check that the fees on a fixed rate are not too high and try to avoid
mortgages tied to compulsory insurance - you could well find cheaper
insurance elsewhere.
Check, too, that the mortgage still applies if you move house within the
fixed rate period, since you do not want to have to pay the early redemption
penalties which are always attached to fixed-rate mortgages.
Lenders have been trying to wean borrowers off fixes and on to their
variable rates by offering discounts and cashback offers. Discounts tend to
represent better value - the lender reduces its variable rate for a
specified period by a set proportion.
The table shows that Northern Rock is offering a 5.25 percentage point
reduction until the beginning of 1996. Since its variable rate is 8.15 per
cent, borrowers will have to pay a mortgage rate of only 2.89 per cent until
then (or 5.25 points lower than the society's variable rate if it changes).
'Lenders are waging a discount war,' says Darby. 'If you want a variable
rate, then a discount is very good value. But if you are on a five-point
discount for a year, and base rates increase again, you could find yourself
moving from 3 per cent to 9 per cent in the space of a month.'
If you want to avoid that kind of shock but still want a discounted rate,
Alliance &amp; Leicester is offering a smaller discount of 1.6 percentage point
spread over three years.
An alternative is to accept a cashback offer instead of a discount. Royal
Bank of Scotland has just launched an extremely competitive variant on the
standard cashback offer of 'take out a mortgage with us and we will give you
Pounds Pounds Pounds cash up-front'.
Borrowers will receive from the bank the equivalent of their first regular
monthly payment (to a maximum of Pounds 1,000) every year during the life of
the mortgage. The mortgage is available on repayments as well as
interest-only mortgages backed by an endowment, personal equity plan or
pension. The early redemption penalty is one month's interest in the first
three years.
Remember, however, that the cashback could be taxable.

An annuity provides guaranteed income for life in return for a lump sum
investment. PURCHASED LIFE ANNUITIES are bought by people wanting extra
regular income. Rates are attractive for older people. The annuity
income is not fully taxable. The table shows rates net of 25 per cent
income tax. Certain rates include 'capital protection' -    allowing
the capital invested - less instalments paid to you - to be returned to
your estate when you die.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Canterbury tales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
University life is marked by borrowing and scrambling to make ends meet.
Most students are familiar with the ritual of requesting an overdraft or
wrangling a loan from parents or the government. Now, students at Canterbury
University in the south of England are being offered an alternative to the
traditional forms of finance.
The Canterbury Local Exchange and Trading System (LETS), a community
bartering scheme in which members trade goods and services such as house
cleaning, gardening and bicycle repair for trade credits, is inviting
students to offer their skills in exchange for an opportunity to stretch
their budgets.
Students will pay Pounds 2 to join and will be assigned an account
denominated in the local trading unit - which in Canterbury, appropriately,
is called the 'tale'.
They will be given a cheque book and a directory of services provided
already by the 200 members in the Canterbury pool. Once they add their
talents - be it baby-sitting, computer skills or aromatherapy - to the list,
they can start trading. A central record-keeper debits or credits each
member's account after each transaction.
LETS have become increasingly popular in Britain, where there are more than
200 schemes. The first was set up in Canada in the 1970s; since then they
have spread to the US, Australia and continental Europe.
Joan Culloty, of the Canterbury LETS, says: 'It will stretch students'
horizons and make it easier for them to survive.' While believing they will
not abuse the system, she admits: 'Some of them may find it difficult to
earn their payments. But we trust them to earn and spend in a reasonable
fashion.'

FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: A capital way to make money - But
those who venture can risk losing out in a volatile market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's highly-publicised flotation of 3i, the venture capital
investment trust, attracted many private investors to venture capital for
the first time. But 3i is only the latest - and largest - addition to a
long-established investment trust sector.
Micropal lists 25 funds in the venture and development capital sector which
invest in small businesses in their start-up phase, or provide extra capital
to more established (but generally still unquoted) companies which need
money to expand or to fund a management buy-out or buy-in.
Many funds are tiny - 10 have less than Pounds 15m under management. Until
3i came to market, Electra was the largest venture capital investment trust,
with assets of Pounds 574m, compared with 3i's Pounds 1.9bn.
The characters of the funds differ as much as their sizes. There are
geographic specialists like Abtrust Scotland which, as its name suggests,
invests mainly north of the border; and the East German investment trust,
which buys privatised East German enterprises.
Several of the general funds - Electra, Ivory &amp; Sime Enterprise, Foreign &amp;
Colonial Enterprise - have substantial holdings in the US as well as the UK.
Pantheon International Participations is unique in the sector as it prefers
to invest through other venture capital funds.
Risk levels also vary widely. A fund with a concentrated portfolio of a few
dozen investments will be more risky than one like Pantheon, which has
indirect stakes in several hundred companies, or 3i, with more than 3,400.
Funds specialising in start-up capital are riskier than those providing
development capital to more established businesses.
Likewise, performances can be poles apart: Micropal's 10-year performance
figures for Pounds 100 invested in venture capital trusts range from Pounds
430 to Pounds 61.
So, the choice is broad. But it can be difficult for private investors to
know what they are buying, not only for what each trust aims to do but also
in terms of value for money.
The usual measure of whether an investment trust is cheap or expensive is
whether its share price is at a discount or premium to net asset value. The
problem is that the accuracy of the discount/premium rating depends on how
accurate the calculation of asset value is.
Asset values of investment trusts with portfolios of quoted shares can
easily be re-calculated every day, but unquoted investments are another
matter - their market value is difficult to determine and highly subjective.
Venture capital investment trusts tend to value their unquoted assets two or
four times a year.
In between valuations, it is impossible to tell if the asset value is rising
or falling - companies in the portfolio may have been awarded lucrative
contracts or be experiencing financial difficulties, but this will not be
reflected in the fund's quoted asset value.
Periodic re-ratings can be quite dramatic, particularly in trusts nearing
their winding-up dates which are selling off stakes and realising large
profits.
3i, for example, values its portfolio twice a year. The last valuation was
at the end of March; the valuation from the end of September is due to be
released next month.
So, although 3i shares were, until recently, trading at a premium to what
analysts estimated was asset value, no one knew for sure whether that was
the case.
Recently, 3i's presumed premium rating has been eroded, as investors have
taken profits - up to 20 per cent for those selling at the 336p peak.
Indeed, some brokers have been recommending that clients sell 3i and buy
other venture capital trusts.
Peter Walls, investment trust analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, says: 'My
belief is that, in asset value terms, one would see better growth and better
performance from the likes of Murray Ventures or Electra for the next two or
three years than one will from 3i - they are trading on relatively generous
discounts.'
But Iain Scouller, investment trust analyst at SG Warburg, points out: 'Some
people have been talking about switching out of 3i into Electra but, looking
at the underlying assets of those trusts, they are very different.' 3i's
portfolio is much more diverse, and more UK-orientated, than Electra or the
other large, general venture capital trusts.
Still, if 3i's profile is what you want over the long term, you should stick
with it; you will not get the same from another trust. But if you want to
put new money into venture capital, or are prepared to go for a riskier
fund, you will probably find better value elsewhere.
Venture capital is not for everyone. It is a highly volatile and potentially
very profitable area - but it can lose investors' money all too easily. Most
advisers recommend treating venture capital funds with caution, and only
investing if you have a broad portfolio of more mainstream investments
already.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Lloyd's - who wins what? / Ralph
Atkins analyses this week's High Court 'victory' for Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The anger of hard-hit Lloyd's Names was vented a little this week. The High
Court's ruling that Gooda Walker Names - among the worst-affected members of
the London insurance market - had been victims of negligent underwriting
during the late 1980s reinforced many Names' arguments that some
professionals who handed their money were incompetent and culpable.
Beyond the sense of vindication, however, the benefits that aggrieved Names
can reap following Tuesday's ruling are not clear. Although Mr Justice
Phillips, the judge, was colourful in criticising the Gooda Walker
underwriters, other cases in the legislative pipeline may not prove as
strong.
Phillips described the insurance 'spiral' in the Gooda Walker case, by which
the underwriters agreed to cover others against excessive losses from
catastrophes, as 'like a multiple game of pass the parcel'. His criticisms
may encourage other 'spiral' cases, particularly Names on the Feltrim
syndicates whose case begins later this month. But they do not set a
precedent.
The next batch of cases, for instance, concern a different set of losses -
those arising from so-called long-tail liabilities: claims related to US
asbestosis and pollution awards in the United States. These affect policies
underwritten by syndicates as far back as the 1940s.
Moreover, when Lloyd's last year appraised the strength of 31 legal cases
pending in its attempts to forge a settlement between all sides embroiled in
legal challenges, Sir Michael Kerr, a former High Court judge, found some
were 'weak' or even 'hopeless'.
Even when Names have a strong case, the justice system is unable to offer
quick recompense. Gooda Walker is a good illustration: although the action
group was quick to organise and had a relatively swift passage through
court, it will still be months before the level of compensation is agreed.
An appeal could delay any deal until next summer. By then, legal action
would have taken more than two years to reach a conclusion. Other action
groups do not even have a date for their cases to begin; many may have to
wait until the end of the century.
Another reason for caution in interpreting the Gooda Walker verdict is that
damages awarded may fall well short of losses incurred by Names. Phillips
said damages for the Gooda Walker Names should be based on losses sustained
by the negligent conduct, rather than total losses. The action group
estimates that will be worth Pounds 504m (compared with its claim of Pounds
629m), but lawyers for the defence describe that as speculative.
One little-noticed feature of the Gooda Walker case, however, was the High
Court's ruling that the Names involved should have some protection against
losses resulting from catastrophes but which have not yet been reported.
Yet, even if the Names win legal backing for compensation, they may not get
their money back. This is because the Lloyd's agencies they are suing may
not have sufficient 'errors and omissions' cover from which claims for
negligence are paid. The best estimates in the Gooda Walker case suggest
about Pounds 250m-Pounds 300m might be available - much of it underwritten
by other Lloyd's Names. In total, E&amp;O cover for agencies being sued probably
totals about Pounds 1bn - compared with total claims of about Pounds 3bn.
In practice, that could mean some groups of Names receiving little more than
they would have under Lloyd's Pounds 900m settlement offer which was
rejected earlier this year.
Josceline Grove, secretary of the Secretan Names Association - which is
claiming Pounds 60m on behalf of 962 individuals in a case still some way
down the legal queue - admits 'it is a race into court and the first groups
could scoop the pool, leaving nothing for the rest'.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Power but no glory

<TEXT>
Did the electricity regulator get it right after all? Professor Stephen
Littlechild drew strong criticism two months ago when he announced a set of
price controls on regional electricity companies that sent share prices
soaring to record levels. The view among politicians was that he had been
too soft and even the City acknowledged he was less tough than he could have
been.
In the past six weeks or so, however, the shares have under-performed. In
some cases, they have sunk to levels below where they were immediately
before Littlechild's announcement. So, after three years of largely
uninterrupted growth, has the bubble burst?
The question will have particular concern for shareholders in Scottish Power
and Scottish Hydro-Electric. When price controls were imposed on them last
week, shares fell immediately as the market judged they had been given a
tough time by the regulator.
National Power and PowerGen, and Northern Ireland Electricity, have been
feeling the breeze, too. Although not subjected to regulatory reviews
recently, they have been hit by falls in the sector and the market.
So what, then, are the prospects for electricity companies? In general, they
remain at least reasonably good but there are some clouds around. The Labour
party is perhaps the biggest threat. Although it seems to have ruled out
re-nationalising the companies, it could impose a windfall tax on the
profits of privatised utilities - a possibility confirmed this week by
Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor.
Although change is much less likely under the Tories, it cannot be ruled
out. The government appears increasingly sensitive to criticism that the
utilities, particularly electricity, are not policed tightly enough, and a
cabinet committee is examining regulation.
Politics apart, there is plenty of potential to keep shareholders smiling in
the medium to long term, so reinforcing the arguments of Littlechild's
critics. Some of the uncertainty surrounding most of the companies recently
will lift in the next few months, particularly in the case of the regional
electricity companies (RECs) in England and Wales.
The main doubts for REC shareholders have centred on the National Grid, the
transmission company which the companies plan to float next summer. The RECs
are putting considerable effort into minimising the capital gains tax they
will have to pay.
The outcome of talks with the Inland Revenue could make a difference of up
to Pounds 1bn in their bill, although most analysts believe the market has
made allowance already for the worst scenario and that share values will
grow when the details of flotation have been decided.
Sorting out the National Grid will allow the companies to press ahead with
other ways of improving share earnings. Most have started share buy-backs
but completion will, in most cases, have to wait until after the results
season, which starts next month and ends in mid-December.
Analysts expect the results, from the first half of the year, to produce
pleasant surprises. With Littlechild's review over, dividend growth is more
likely to exceed expectations than disappoint them. Indeed, the City is
expecting at least 6 to 8 per cent real growth a year from all RECs for the
rest of the decade.
For all of these reasons, analysts view the shares as good value. But there
is less enthusiasm for the Scottish companies. Privatised later than the
RECs, they have always been squeezed by tougher controls. Hopes that the
regulator might ease these significantly in his review were dashed.
The Scots have no National Grid to sell and no immediate plans to buy back
shares. Most analysts think they have less scope to increase dividends, even
if real growth is likely to be 5 per cent minimum a year.
Even so, some analysts feel the Scottish shares have fallen too much since
the review; they point out that both companies have potential to increase
their unregulated earnings by exporting power to the rest of the UK.
Nonetheless, the companies - Hydro, in particular - are struggling to
overcome the feeling that their prospects are less exciting than those of
the RECs.
National Power and PowerGen are considered to have better basics although
their shares have been unsettled recently. One reason was the uncertainty
created by the government's sale next February of its remaining 40 per cent
stakes in the companies.
Another is the revival in the dash for gas by rivals: the more independent
gas-fired stations that come on stream, the less room there is in the market
for the two companies' older, coal-fired stations.
A further problem is that they have agreed a deal with the electricity
regulator under which they will try to sell off 6,000mw of capacity by the
end of next year. Failure to do so could cause them to be referred to the
Monopolies Commission, although that seems unlikely.
But the two companies do have strong balance sheets and above-average
dividend growth is expected of both: indeed, some analysts believe they can
increase dividends by more than 15 per cent a year.
Northern Ireland Electricity's image as sector star has been dented
following the reviews involving the mainland companies. While these were
under way, some investors bought NIE as a hedge against tough price controls
in England, Scotland and Wales.
Still, NIE continues to be regarded highly and, as it was privatised only
last year, many of the rewards of cost-cutting lie ahead.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: BSkyB heads to market - New issues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dominating the markets this week was the announcement on Thursday of plans
by satellite broadcaster BSkyB to go public. The issue, scheduled
tentatively to take place before Christmas, is likely to involve the sale of
up to Pounds 1bn of new BSkyB shares, or 20 per cent of its enlarged equity,
valuing the company at just under Pounds 5bn.
After years of losses, the company has become increasingly profitable,
posting Pounds 176.8m at the operating level in the year to June against
Pounds 54.1m the previous year.
The proceeds of the issue, to be sponsored by Goldman Sachs and Lazard
Brothers, will be used to reduce the group's Pounds 1.7bn debt.
The company's four shareholders - Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation;
Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times; Chargeurs, a French textile
company; and UK media and catering group Granada - will benefit from the
repayment of the Pounds 1.2bn portion of debt they have given or guaranteed.
News, which provided roughly half the shareholder debt, should receive
around Pounds 500m after the issue.
None of the shareholders intends to sell any shares in the flotation.
Indeed, Chargeurs plans to buy more shares to prevent dilution of its stake.
Biocompatibles International, a research company moving into medical
equipment manufacturing, issued its pathfinder prospectus on Wednesday. It
is expected to have a market value of about Pounds 80m and is seeking up to
Pounds 40m through the issue of new shares.
The pathfinder, which shows that the company had accumulated losses of
Pounds 9.77m at the end of June, warns that investment in the company
involves a higher than normal degree of risk.
Sponsor to the issue is Robert Fleming and the broker is Smith New Court.
The pathfinder was also published for Churchill China, which intends to be
the third Staffordshire-based china company to float this year. Hoare Govett
is sponsor and broker.
Despite investor nervousness about new issues, Servisair, the independent
aircraft and passenger handling company, announced its flotation was fully
underwritten at its target price, valuing the company at Pounds 54.3m.
Calluna, a manufacturer of computer hard disks, announced plans yesterday to
float on the Unlisted Securities Market through a Pounds 10m to Pounds 12m
placing.
Dealing began in Games Workshop on Thursday, the shares opening at 115p and
closing at a 3p premium. Commodity trader ED&amp;F Man began trading yesterday,
the shares closing down 8p at 172p.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: The week ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MONDAY: George Simpson presents his first results at Lucas Industries, the
automotive and aerospace component supplier, since his arrival from Rover to
take over as chief executive.
The revival of automotive business suggests 1993-94 pre-tax profits of
around Pounds 60m -Pounds 80m against Pounds 50.3m last time, with total
dividends maintained at 7p. But provisions could amount to Pounds 100m as
Simpson takes Lucas into another round of cutting costs - including the
possibility of job cuts and plant closures - and rationalising the product
range. MONDAY: Scottish Television's pre-tax profits are expected to have
risen from Pounds 3.13m to Pounds 3.9m in the first half, but advertising
revenues could be weak. Analysts will look for a response to this week's
disclosure that Mirror Group Newspapers has increased its stake from 15 to
20 per cent. TUESDAY: St Ives, the UK's largest independent printer, is
forecast to announce a rise in annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 22.1m to
roughly Pounds 25m. Magazine and book printing should show some recovery,
but there are concerns that large customers may try to lower printing costs
to counter higher paper prices.
WEDNESDAY: Lloyds Chemists, which runs the UK's second-largest chain after
Boots, is expected to announce annual pre-tax profits of around Pounds 56m.
The City is also looking forward to a sharp increase in the total dividend,
possibly to more than 9.5p. WEDNESDAY: Gardner Merchant, the largest
contract caterer in Europe, announces its interim results. But plans to
float the group appear unlikely to go ahead until next spring. Last year the
group, bought by the management from Forte for Pounds 402m at the end of
1992, made annual profits of Pounds 46.9m on Pounds 1bn turnover. THURSDAY:
Body Shop International, the UK-based natural cosmetics retailer, will
attempt to forget a summer of criticism over its ethical credentials and
focus attention on its trading prospects as it announces interim results.
Analysts are looking for a healthy increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds
10m to about Pounds 11.5m. Total sales are forecast to have increased 15 per
cent, with those in the US about 30 per cent ahead.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONAND, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The largest sale of the week took place at Irish property company Ewart
where Frank Tughan sold more than 2.7m shares at 70p and then resigned. The
stock was bought by Fortress Hill, a company owned by Brian O'Connor,
chairman and chief executive of Allied Group.
Keith Edwards, previously managing director of the wholesale division of ISA
International, is another director to have resigned from his job and to sell
the majority of his holding at the same time.
Shares at Wilshaw, the diversified engineering and building products firm,
have been performing well over the past year, recording a relative
outperformance of 68 per cent. The sale by Trevor Brentnall, a non-executive
director, at 55.5p leaves him with 340,000.
Lookers. Last week, we noted that directors had been exercising options and
selling the resulting holdings. In fact, directors have been net buyers of
the stock.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Commodities - a stake in the real
world / If you're bored with equities, why not invest in natural products?
Scheherazade Daneshkhu and Bethan Hutton examine the prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forget stocks and shares: the latest investment theme is real products that
you can eat, burn, or make things with. Fund managers are saying that the
world economic recovery will increase the demand for commodities - mining
and agricultural products as diverse as zinc, oil, gas, rubber, soya beans,
sugar and pork bellies - and drive prices higher.
The other big idea is that because the prices of commodities are inversely
correlated with equity and bond prices - so that commodity prices rise when
equity and bond prices are falling, and vice-versa - the overall volatility
of a portfolio should be reduced.
A commodity element in a portfolio is supposed to act as a hedge against
inflation, too. This is not just because prices of real assets like
commodities tend to rise in line with inflation; in fact, rising commodity
prices are a factor in generating inflation.
The worry about investing in commodities now is that the prices of several
major commodities - particularly coffee and copper - have had spectacular
increases already this year. Cynical investors might wonder if, once again,
they are being invited to board the bandwagon near the top of the hill just
in time to start heading down.
But Ronald Gould, of BZW Investment Management, argues that while a few
individual commodity prices may have raced ahead, commodities as a whole are
up only 5 per cent so far this year. Indeed, if you take a 12-month view,
they are actually down slightly.
Investment trusts
Until now, there have been few investment trusts offering the private
investor exposure to commodities. The nearest is Julian Baring's Mercury
World Mining trust, launched about a year ago. But two London investment
managers are hoping to catch the growing interest in commodities by
launching new investment vehicles.
Fleming is in the early stages of launching a natural resources investment
trust, while BZW is a little further ahead with its commodities trust (while
this actually is a Jersey incorporated investment company, it will be listed
on the London stock exchange and behave just like a normal investment
trust). Institutional investors have committed themselves to buy shares
worth just under Pounds 70m in this fund; the offer for private investors
closes later this month.
Neither Fleming nor BZW will invest in physical commodities - no warehouses
piled high with coffee beans or tankers full of oil. That apart, the two
funds will take very different approaches to the sector. BZW's strategy is
based on using derivative products to gain exposure and it aims to beat the
Goldman Sachs commodity index. While some risk-averse investors may be
alarmed by the very word 'derivatives', Gould stresses that BZW will not use
these to gear up the fund.
Instead, the managers will buy mainly loan notes, where the return is linked
directly to the price of an individual commodity or index; or
commodity-linked swaps, which are more speculative except that BZW will back
them with cash in short-term money market instruments.
The fund's model portfolio will have just over half its assets linked to oil
and gas, with smaller amounts in livestock, agricultural commodities,
industrial and precious metals. The asset allocation is similar to, but not
identical with, Goldman Sachs' proportions. Fleming, on the other hand, is
planning to get exposure to commodities by buying shares in companies around
the world which are involved in extracting, cultivating and processing
natural resources.
The managers will have an industrial bias, concentrating on oil, gas and
non-precious metals rather than the more glamorous gold and platinum. The
idea is to ride the commodities cycle, so the fund will have a limited life
of between three and seven years. This allows the managers to sell up at the
most opportune moment.
BZW's minimum investment level has been set at Pounds 5,000 in order to
exclude small-scale or novice investors. The fund is aimed at institutions
or sophisticated private investors looking for diversification
opportunities. The prospectus states quite clearly that the trust 'should be
seen as complementary to existing investments in a wide spread of other
financial assets, and should not form a major part of an investment
portfolio'.
The Fleming trust is more open to smaller investors. Its minimum investment
has not yet been set but is likely to be around Pounds 2,500. The same risk
warnings apply, however: consider this fund only if you have a broad spread
of equity investments.
Unit trusts
Private investors have always had a far wider choice of commodity and energy
unit trusts than investment trusts. The composition of the funds varies
considerable, with some concentrating on a single commodity such as oil or
gold while others have a broad spread. The table lists the funds and their
performance to October 1.
The best performer has been Mercury Gold &amp; General, managed by Julian
Baring. This outperformance, combined with the recent fashion for
commodities, has seen it grow from Pounds 26m at the beginning of last year
to just under Pounds 400m - far larger than the sum of all the other trusts
in the sector.
Is this a good time to invest in commodities? David Hutchins, manager of
M&amp;G's two funds dealing in them, believes the recent interest indicates that
the sector is nearer its top than the bottom. He adds: 'A lot of money has
already been made. For example, base metals have moved up by 40 to 60 per
cent since last September. However, in previous cycles, metal prices have
increased by as much as 300 per cent, which suggests that there is still
more to go, particularly since the cycle usually lasts two to three years,
not just one.'
Mark Lawson-Statham of Fleming, who manages S&amp;P's Energy Industries fund
(which is over 90 per cent invested in oil stocks) also is hopeful about
prospects despite the fact that oil is cheaper today, in real terms, than in
1986 when there was a price crash. He says: 'When capacity utilisation
(production divided by the capacity to produce) goes above 90 per cent, you
get a price explosion. It is now over 90 per cent and will remain high,
probably at over 95 per cent, to the end of the decade. Oil demand has grown
every year since 1986 despite the recession.'
The driving force is demand from the Far East (plus the cheapness of oil).
And since the amount of oil consumed per capita in Asia is only one-tenth of
that consumed in the west, it is likely this demand will continue to
increase. 'We have a cyclical commodity pattern backed by a stong structural
picture,' adds Lawson-Statham.
The chart shows that, historically, shares have outperformed commodities
(measured by the Commodity Research Bureau's futures index). Thus, while
good returns may be had periodically from commodities, private investors
should take only a small punt.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Markets: Profit warning hits dealers where it hurts - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
People in the City of London are much like those anywhere else: bad news
seems worse the nearer to home it strikes. This was apparent in the reaction
to developments which brought the recent weakness of the bond and equity
markets all too close to their trading screens.
The FT-SE 100 fell 42.8 points on Monday after SG Warburg, the UK's largest
investment bank, warned that its interim profits would be more than halved
because of a plunge in profits from trading in bonds, equities and
derivatives. The next day another rival merchant bank, Hambros, said it had
also suffered losses on the bond market and would make only about half of
last year's interim profits.
Traders were suddenly faced with the worrying thought that highly-paid jobs
might be at risk in the Square Mile, which last year enjoyed a bonanza from
the surging equity market. There appears to be little immediate prospect of
widespread lay-offs, but bonuses seem certain to be a pale shadow of the
previous year's bounty.
One merchant banker commented: 'After the party of '93, comes the hangover.'
And indeed the chart shows that the merchant banks sector has outperformed
the market in the past two years, even after this week's downward
correction. However, it is easier to take such a philosophical stance if -
like the banker in question - one is not too directly exposed to the bond
and equity markets.
Warburg has followed the example of the big US investment banks, which offer
clients trading services as well as fee-based advice. These US banks have
also recently suffered big losses on the trading side, and greater
volatility in profits seems an inevitable consequence of adopting such a
strategy.
There remains plenty of corporate activity around - not least new issues.
KPMG Peat Marwick forecast that this year was still set to break records for
flotations, in spite of issues being pulled and a disturbing level of profit
warnings from recent candidates. So far this year, KPMG estimates that a
total of Pounds 7.8bn has been raised from 182 new issues, and it expects
that a pick-up in activity before the November budget will put the final
tally comfortably ahead of the 1986 record of Pounds 9bn.
KPMG said investors who had had their fingers burnt would be particularly
wary and some companies would face an uphill struggle to convince investors
that they were of a suitable size and quality to join the main stock market.
One company that will easily overcome the scale barrier is British Sky
Broadcasting, the satellite television company which confirmed that it plans
to stage a share issue on the London and New York markets. The issue,
provisionally programmed to take place before Christmas, is expected to
involve the sale of up to Pounds 1bn of new BSkyB shares, or 20 per cent of
its enlarged equity, valuing the company at just under Pounds 5bn.
Meanwhile, the equity market's movements continued to be dominated by bonds.
As well as the Warburg announcement, Monday's plunge was attributable to
weakness in gilts after worryingly high UK money supply figures and the
increased concern over inflationary pressures in the US.
An unconvincing 18-point rally in thin trading on Tuesday was followed by a
45.5-point downward lurch on Wednesday, when strong growth in US factory
orders heightened fears that US interest rates would have to rise soon. The
FT-SE did regain 28 points on Thursday, mainly because a dip in UK
manufacturing output in August suggested there was less pressure to raise to
raise UK interest rates again. Yet traders are fixated by Wall Street. Only
when yesterday's US payroll and unemployment data were received without the
feared rise in the Federal Reserve's interest rate did the market relax, to
close 14 points higher  - down 27.6 on the week.
The uncertain outlook is best illustrated by the huge range of year-end
forecasts for the FT-SE. James Capel, the UK's biggest broker, downgraded
its target to 2,840, but some brave souls are still sticking by 3,600. Robin
Aspinall, Panmure Gordon's bearish analyst, started the week boasting that
his year-end forecast of 2,800 was the only one in the City not to need
changing this year, but after Wednesday's rout was reminding institutions of
his 'ultimate target' of 2,200.
Aspinall points to the UK car sales: 'While consumers have stopped buying
cars (personal purchases were 4.5 per cent lower in September than a year
earlier), companies are still buying enough for their fleets to boost total
sales by 6.5 per cent. Companies' finances are in better shape than
consumers', but that cannot last for long without the consumers' help. We
are heading for a consumer-led recession.'
J. Sainsbury, the UK's largest grocery retailer, would not subscribe to such
a gloomy conclusion but nevertheless continued its diversification away from
the UK food retailing market by taking a Pounds 205m stake in Giant Food, a
Washington DC-based supermarket chain. The deal is Sainsbury's second move
into the US, after taking control of the Shaw's supermarket chain in the
north-eastern US in 1987. It gives the UK retailer a strong position on the
eastern seaboard.
A City crash would also be bad news for Vendome, the luxury goods group,
which this week paid an undisclosed sum for James Purdey &amp; Sons, Britain's
most famous sporting gunmaker. In spite of prices which range up to Pounds
40,000, there is an 18-month waiting list for the shotguns, which Purdey has
been making for 200 years at its premises in London's Picaddilly.
Given the febrile state of the financial markets, perhaps even unemployed
stockbrokers would prefer to blow some of their pay-off on blasting at birds

FT  08 OCT 94 / Markets: A little knowledge is a sensible thing - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Options trader, quantitative analyst, property economist, pensions manager,
swaps trader, foreign exchange dealer, investment manager, head of high
yield and distressed debt: this list is not some yuppie equivalent of
'tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor'; it reflects the new student intake at
London Business School's investment management course.
Tuesday evening this week found all these high-powered, highly-paid students
solemnly tossing a pair of dice 10 times to simulate probable portfolio
returns. More prosaic moments dinned home such useful messages as:
Risk-tolerant and long-term investors prefer more equity.
Investors with real liabilities prefer short gilts to long (or
index-linked).
Investors with nominal liabilities prefer to match.
High-tax investors prefer short gilts to long gilts.
Most serious private investors would have found the seminar illuminating,
but one residual query is obvious: to what extent can even a rich individual
make use of investment theory intended for professionals managing
multi-million pound portfolios?
You might well run your own investment portfolio very differently from that
of a pension fund or unit trust. But the more you understand about the
characteristics of different types of security and the way professional
investors use them, the better. Knowledge might not help you to make money -
but it should help you to avoid losing it. And steering clear of pitfalls
plays a large part in successful investment.
Take risk, for example. Most sensible investors take some risks, but they do
not take risks which are at odds with their objectives or unlikely to offer
a commensurately greater reward.
It would be stupid to buy a share that you expected at best to provide the
same return as a gilt held to maturity. Since the return on the share is
uncertain, it becomes a sensible choice only if you expect it to produce a
higher return than the safer alternative. Diversification helps reduce risk.
Such basic cautions are as useful to the individual investor as they are to
the professional. They may seem blindingly obvious, but too many people
still regard buying shares as the financial equivalent of a white-knuckle
ride without a safety net: a test of machismo. Unsurprisingly, such
investors tend to end up losing money.
Emerging stock markets are one type of investment where risk/return
calculations are particularly relevant. After a hectic rise in 1993, the
markets - which include those in the fast developing countries of Asia,
Latin America and central and eastern Europe - have first fallen sharply and
then recovered so far this year.
There is at present a heated debate among professional investors as to
whether emerging markets represent good value at their present levels. What
is slightly chastening about this debate is that such intelligent people can
use the same evidence to come to opposite conclusions.
Two recent papers sum it up. 'Has the gravy train been and gone?' asks David
Shaw at Legal &amp; General.
His answer is that although there continues to be 'a strong, compelling
secular case for emerging markets, the purely cyclical justification is near
the end of its shelf life'. In other words, they are still attractive in the
long term, but investors should be ready to take profits in the short term.
Shaw's immediate worry is that US interest rates will rise enough next year
to pull mutual fund money back home. If the Fed funds' rate tops 6 per cent
(against the present 4 3/4 per cent), that will trigger 'the US private
investors' liquidity preference'. So, the little old lady from Pasadena will
call her wandering dollars home from Rio and Beijing. And the long feared
global capital shortage will become reality.
Over at Independent Strategy, David Roche has an answer to this fear. 'The
global capital market is like a bath that is being tipped towards the deep
end of high returns in the restructuring economies,' he says.
Capital will be sucked out of the rich countries and fed into more
productive investments in infrastructure and technology in the emerging
economies. And 'the existence of hedge funds and derivatives guarantees
that, when the bath tips, the water will slosh towards the productive end
fast, though perhaps with considerable volatility'.
Since the rewards look good enough, investors will accept the risk. But mind
your eye.
This is one of those pleasing occasions where private investors are actually
placed better than professionals. The two Davids both agree about the
long-term attractions of emerging markets, and any sensible private investor
would put money in emerging markets only on a long-term basis.
Hoping to hit the jackpot by trading in and out of this kind of market is a
mug's game. But owning shares in an emerging markets trust is a the mark of
a canny long-term investor.
Are personal equity plans a tax break used only by the rich? Autif is keen
to point out that 50 per cent of unit trust Pep-holders are basic-rate
taxpayers. Yes, but . . .
One of the worries about Peps is that they are often sold to people who are
unlikely to benefit from them - such as basic-rate taxpayers.

The launch of the Infostructure investment trust by BZW and Societe Generale
Strauss Turnbull is being postponed until the new year because of the
continuing poor market for new issues. The trust plans to specialise in
emerging markets' companies involved in advertising, telecommunications,
software, broadcasting, and other elements of the 'information

have achieved its stated minimum target of Pounds 40m this autumn, he

FT  08 OCT 94 / Markets: Elsevier digs for electronic gold - Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last Saturday, the co-chairman and chief financial officer of Reed Elsevier
took a break from meetings with US investors and spent the day playing the
tourist at deserted gold mines in Colorado, unaware they were about to
clinch a Dollars 1.5bn-deal.
Ian Irvine and Nigel Stapleton discussed the Anglo-Dutch publisher's
imminent launch on the New York Stock Exchange. But they barely mentioned
the group's long-term ambition to become a leading provider of electronic
information.
Within 48 hours, however, they had doubled the size of Reed Elsevier's
electronic publishing operations by agreeing to buy Mead Data Central - the
US distributor of on-line legal and business information.
The rapid turn of events was dictated by Mead Corporation, the paper and
forestry group, which decided quite suddenly to offer its MDC subsidiary to
Reed Elsevier after months of tentative negotiations.
A contract was drawn up in New York, Stapleton signed it and flew back to
London on Concorde. On the flight, he polished a presentation designed to
convince City analysts and institutions that the group had pulled off an
unexpected coup - winning control of the Ohio-based business in spite of
rival offers from Times Mirror, the US media group, and Thomson Corporation
of Canada.
After hearing Reed Elsevier's financial and strategic arguments, most
analysts have welcomed the deal, which is to be financed from cash reserves
and Dollars 1bn of borrowings.
'They have won access to a fast-growing electronic distribution network  -
that's the way forward for the group's professional and scientific
publishing businesses,' says Chris Munro of Hoare Govett.
Her view is echoed by Louise Barton, media analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite.
She says concerns at MDC's price have been soothed by forecasts showing
interest cover will remain above six times despite the near doubling of net
debt to Pounds 1.2bn.
'This is a sound strategic fit and the funding is well within the
constraints imposed by the balance sheet,' she adds.
Nevertheless, shares in Reed International and Elsevier, which merged last
year, fell after Moody's put its long-term debt ratings on review for
possible downgrade.
While admitting that gearing of 90 per cent looks steep, Nigel Stapleton
points out that the group's strong cash flow - Pounds 217m at the half year
stage - should enable it to pay down a large part of the debt within three
years.
The shares have since stabilised and should bounce back if MDC delivers the
growth expected by its new owners.
The electronic publisher is likely to contribute about Dollars 75m of
profits and Dollars 612m of sales next year - pushing North American
turnover close to 50 per cent of the group total.
By amortising a Dollars 1.27bn slug of goodwill, Reed Elsevier will enjoy
tax relief on those profits and ensure the deal is earnings enhancing.
'There are clear financial advantages,' says Frans van Schaik, of Barclays
de Zoete Wedd Nederland. 'It should add about 3 per cent to earnings per
share next year.'
On his forecasts, full year eps would rise from 41.9p to about 43.2p. Other
analysts predict an even larger jump to 49.5p by the end of 1995.
Strategically, the prospects are also alluring. MDC's two main businesses -
Lexis and Nexis - look set to grow rapidly. Demand for Lexis, the on-line
legal service used by 20 per cent of US lawyers, is expected to increase
almost 10 per cent next year. Nexis, the business information arm, has
access to more than 4,500 databases and is sold worldwide.
More importantly, they offer an electronic highway for Reed Elsevier's
high-margin scientific and professional publications, which could be
transferred from hard copy by the end of the decade.
That strategic shift looked some way off last weekend. But the MDC deal has
enabled the Anglo-Dutch group to fulfil its ambitions earlier than expected.
'Reed Elsevier will be able to better realise MDC's tremendous growth
potential,' says Steven Mason, Mead's chairman. 'The acquisition puts it in
a unique position in a rapidly developing industry.'

FT  08 OCT 94 / Markets: Endless growth, full employment, utter gloom - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These can be confusing times for anyone who follows Wall Street. Consider
this: the US economy is in its fourth year of growth and about to enter a
fifth, corporate profits are healthy, consumer spending is strong, inflation
is low, and the expansion in the labour market has pushed the national
unemployment rate down to a level low enough for some analysts to claim that
the economy is close to full employment.
Yet, instead of celebrating their good fortune, investors in the US stock
and bond markets are unhappy. Yesterday's seemingly good news from the
September employment report - non-farm payrolls rose by 239,000 and the
national jobless rate dropped from 6.1 per cent to 5.9 per cent, its lowest
level in four years - was greeted with a marked absence of enthusiasm on
Wall Street.
After an initial rally, bond prices and stock prices fell back yesterday,
and were either flat or below their opening values by midday. Stocks took a
beating this week because of fears that the economy is growing too strongly,
and bonds are trading close to levels where the yield on the 30-year issue
flirts dangerously with 8 per cent, a mark many analysts label
'psychologically important'. (This means that investors will have a nervous
breakdown and sell everything in a wild panic the moment the yield rises
above 8 per cent.)
At least the bond market's discontent makes sense. Rising economic growth
almost invariably translates into higher inflation, and inflation undermines
the value of fixed-income assets such as government securities. The fact
that inflation is low today is not reassuring - it is the prospect of higher
inflation tomorrow, and next year, that has the bond market rattled.
The explanation for the stock market's behaviour is less straightforward.
Although a strong economy and rising employment means higher corporate
profits, equity investors - like their counterparts in the bond market - are
looking forward six or 12 months. What they see ahead is a worrying reversal
in both economic and company earnings growth, a reversal engineered by the
Federal Reserve, which has raised interest rates five times this year in an
attempt to slow the economy and restrain inflation.
The immediate fear in both markets is that the Fed will raise rates a sixth
time, possibly as early as next week when the government releases the
September inflation figures. In fact, for much of this week, investors were
concerned that the Fed would tighten monetary policy yesterday, after the
jobs data were released.
Although the employment report failed to trigger a rate rise, it proved to
be a mixed blessing for markets. The 239,000 rise in non-farm payrolls was
smaller than forecast, but for anyone worried about jobs growth this news
was offset by upward revisions in the previous estimates of July and August
payrolls. The revisions meant that 106,000 jobs were created this summer of
which the markets had been unware.
When combined with the unexpected drop in the national unemployment rate to
5.9 per cent, the September report was unsettling news. Analysts said
yesterday that if the figures were not bad enough on their own to prompt an
immediate Fed rate increase, they certainly increased the pressure on the
central bank to raise rates. If next week's inflation numbers come in above
the forecasts, analysts are convinced that the Fed will tighten policy.
A sixth interest rate increase in eight months would spell trouble for
stocks, which after a solid third quarter (the Dow Jones Industrial Average
rose 6 per cent between July and September) are looking vulnerable to a
sharp sell-off.
If the Fed does act, a rate rise will spoil what should be another
encouraging quarterly reporting season. Since the Fed first put up rates in
February, the one factor sustaining share prices has been corporate profits,
which have grown steadily.
Soon that crutch may be removed. At some stage, higher interest rates will
effect the economy and earnings. So far, only two sectors have felt the
sting: the Wall Street investment banks and brokerage firms, which have seen
their profits from securities trading, underwriting and broking plunge, (on
Thursday Salomon said it would report a loss of about Dollars 100m in the
third quarter because it had lost money trading its own capital in the
markets), and the money-centre banks, which have been hurt by lower
securities trading profits.
Eventually, other industries will start to suffer. Analysts warn that this
could happen as early as the first quarter of next year. It is these
warnings of trouble tomorrow that are depressing prices today.

FT  08 OCT 94 / The Long View: Shadow of a smile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was something strange about Dr Mortimer Duhm when he passed through
town this week. He was smiling. Mort Duhm is intolerable during a bull
market, but in bearish conditions he comes into his own. And you have to
admit that this year he has been absolutely right. 'The US Treasury long
bond yield has backed up from 6.2 per cent to 8 per cent since January,' he
pointed out. 'It's proportionately almost as big a shift as before the 1987
stock market crash when the rise was from 7.3 to 10.2 per cent between
January and October.'
It is true, I said, that Fortune magazine has calculated this year's paper
losses at Dollars 600bn on US bonds and Dollars 1,500bn on bonds world-wide.
On average, everybody in the world has lost Dollars 280. But surely the
leveraged hedge funds which caused a lot of the instability were out fairly
early on. Why are we suffering a second stage in the collapse this autumn?
'They weren't the biggest players, even though they got most of the
publicity,' said Duhm. 'There were also the proprietary trading desks of the
big securities firms and banks. The bad news is still only trickling out, as
with the profit warning from Hambros bank in London this week and the staff
redundancy warning at Goldman Sachs.
'Then there were the US commercial banks, which were offered a free ride
along the yield curve in 1992 and 1993 by the US Federal Reserve. Few of
them have yet owned up to their true losses. They are what are called
capitulation sellers. They hold on and hold on, hoping for a rally, but
finally give up. They may be forced into a clean break before the calendar
year-end.'
The obvious weak point about the 1993 bond bull market, I said, was that the
bonds were not going into firm, long-term hands. UK gilts were hardly being
bought by British pension funds, which took just Pounds 2.7bn worth, but
very largely by unspecified foreigners who vacuumed up gilts worth Pounds
16.6bn.
'And the OECD countries are trying to dump another Dollars 400bn-plus of
bonds into these devastated markets this year,' added Duhm. 'It's crazy.
Now, Italian government debt is yielding 12 per cent and there are scuffles
in the streets in Rome outside the prime minister's office.'
But, I pointed out, at least the US equity market had been holding up,
almost against the odds. As recently as September 15, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average was only 25 points short of its all-time high, and it was
still only 5 per cent off that peak.
'But haven't you noticed how artificial that performance is?' replied Duhm.
'The market leaders are being propped up by take-over speculation and maybe
by actual manipulation. Elsewhere, the transports and the utilities are off
more than 20 per cent since last winter. American investors have been
selling some of the overseas stock markets like Hong Kong, which is down a
quarter this year, and the European markets, many of which are down by
between 15 and 20 per cent from the peak in local currencies. The US market
is being shielded, but it can't last long.'
There had been strong echoes of 1987 in all this, I said. That year's
similar bond market collapse reflected the way investors became scared about
rapid economic growth and rising inflation. Global economic growth was
around 4 per cent, a level to which we are only now getting back.
In 1987, however, the distortions were rather more extreme: the ratio of the
US Treasury long bond yield to the US equity market dividend yield rocketed
from under 3 to over 4, whereas it is now about 3.3. Although that is still
much higher than at any time since 1987 it does not indicate another
full-blooded crash so much as a more modest correction.
'You're an optimist,' Duhm declared. 'Remember that the scale of the
required equity market adjustment seven years ago was moderated by a
simultaneous bond market recovery. But conditions in the global bond market
today are uglier. If the US long bond yield goes to over 8 per cent, then
the required correction in equities on Wall Street could still be 25 per
cent.
'Some of the other pieces of the 1987 jigsaw might also fall into place. The
Federal Reserve could be just about to raise the discount rate again, as it
did in September 1987. All we would then need would be an unexpected German
tightening.
'And finally,' grunted Duhm, 'we have the derivatives factor. Portfolio
insurance was another of the sub-causes of the 1987 disaster. In seven
years, the rocket scientists have had plenty of time to plant some much
bigger ticking bombs. We don't for sure know what they are, but we shall be
lucky if none of them goes off. For instance, look at the billions in
untradeable instruments in the mortgage-backed securities market, where
Kidder Peabody is being bailed out by its wealthy parent, General Electric.'
But a lot of this was just scare talk, I protested. There were many cases of
foolish corporate treasurers caught by derivative positions that went the
wrong way, but this was not the same as systemic collapse. Moreover, for
every widely-reported loss, somebody somewhere was quietly making a profit.
Mortimer Duhm snorted. 'The system can only learn from its mistakes,' he
snapped. 'The derivatives markets are only as strong as their weakest links.
They are going to be tested. So are governments, as they are pulled two
ways. They know they have to stop burying the world in bonds and forcing
real interest rates ever higher. On the other hand, they perceive their
response in 1987, in cutting short-term interest rates and boosting
liquidity, as a mistake which generated an inflationary boom and bust. The
markets will have to decide for them.'
He added: 'But when a big investment bank folds, or the first western
country re-schedules its debt, that could be a major buying signal.' I swear
that Dr Duhm almost smiled again.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Lira falls further after police raid Berlusconi business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Police early yesterday raided the Milan offices of Fininvest, the business
empire of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, damping hopes that his rightwing
coalition's confrontation with the judiciary might be contained.
The raid, in which computerised information was seized, contributed to a
fresh fall in the lira, which traded at L1020 to the D-Mark, and a slide of
nearly 3 per cent on the Milan bourse. The financial markets were also
nervous about a senate vote that blocked measures to raise 1995 budget
revenues through an amnesty on illegal buildings.
The move by the police, acting on magistrates' orders, followed the decision
by the government coalition on Thursday to send a formal complaint to
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro about the behaviour of Mr Francesco Saverio
Borrelli, the Milan public prosecutor. Mr Borrelli had said in a newspaper
interview that judicial inquiries into corruption at Fininvest were coming
close to implicating Mr Berlusconi.
The cabinet asked President Scalfaro to decide whether disciplinary
proceedings should be brought against the prosecutor or a criminal
prosecution for attacking constitutional authority.
The timing of the police seizure suggests it was linked to the complaint
filed against Mr Borrelli. This appeared to be confirmed by the Milan
magistrates, who indicated police were seeking floppy discs connected to the
activities of Telepiu, the cable television channel in which Mr Berlusconi
has a 10 per cent stake.
The magistrates are investigating whether Mr Berlusconi retained secret
control of Telepiu through friendly shareholders after he divested 90 per
cent of his stake in 60 days under anti-trust laws in 1990. Mr Berlusconi
this week denied there had been any impropriety.
President Scalfaro can do nothing with the complaint against Mr Borrelli,
but if he fails to support Mr Berlusconi, he risks undermining the prime
minister's weak position.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Japan backs Seoul minister for WTO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The diplomatic contest for top job at the new World Trade Organisation
intensified yesterday, after Japan decided to back Mr Kim Chul-su, South
Korea's trade minister.
Japan's initiative will complicate the search for consensus between the 123
members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is due to be
replaced by the more powerful new body in January.
Until yesterday, Mr Kim was an outsider, backed by Australia and some Asian
countries. The endorsement by the world's second-largest economy now gives
him the clout to rival the two front-runners. They are Mr Carlos Salinas,
former president of Mexico, who is expected to receive US support; and Mr
Renato Ruggiero, a former Italian trade minister backed by the European
Union.
Japan's move means the choice of a WTO head, crucial to the organisation's
success, now rests on negotiations between the world's three main economic
blocs, the US, Europe and Asia. Governments aim to make a decision by late
autumn.
Tokyo's public endorsement of Mr Kim, announced late on Thursday by Mr
Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister, is the latest sign of how Japan's
previously passive foreign policy is becoming less dependent on the US, in
favour of its increasing trade and financial ties with Asian neighbours.
'We prefer a candidate from our region,' said a Japanese foreign ministry
official.
'Japan attaches great importance to Asia, especially in terms of trade, and
we believe this is a good way to encourage neighbouring countries to be
active in the WTO. It may lead to more trade liberalisation in those
countries.'
This appears to be a blow to the EU's hopes that Mr Ruggiero would win the
support of Mr Kim's backers. Brussels would continue to promote Mr Ruggiero,
said an EU official yesterday.
Asian nations have reservations over the candidacy of Mr Salinas because
they fear he might be coloured by Mexico's links with the US in the North
American Free Trade Agreement.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Rover workers get 10% pay rise over two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Rover Group has signalled an upward turn in British pay deals with a
two-year award of about 10 per cent for most of its 33,000 employees.
Average settlements in the engineering industry are still running at about
the rate of inflation, currently 2.4 per cent. But the Rover deal could
exacerbate pay pressures as inflation is expected to increase gently over
the coming year and unemployment continues to fall.
Mr Alistair Hatchett, of the independent pay analyst Incomes Data Services,
said: 'This could be a weather-vane settlement for the private sector and
will be taken as a benchmark in the West Midlands.'
The pay agreement - the first since the company was taken over by the German
car group BMW earlier this year - is a reflection of Rover's recent success
and follows a pay freeze in the first six months of 1993. But the deal will
not make it popular with other car companies, such as Jaguar, which begin
negotiations this weekend.
The exact size of the rise is disputed. The company says that everyone will
receive a 3.7 per cent rise from next month and a further 4 per cent, or the
rate of inflation if it is higher, from November 1995.
It also says that some workers will get extra payments for accepting a
grading change. Following Rover's 'new deal' agreed with the unions in 1992,
the company has been phasing out demarcation lines and distinctions between
blue and white-collar workers.
The latest move involves merging five manual grades and six staff grades
into three joint grades. The unions say that most employees will get an
extra payment of about Pounds 5 a week in the first year and another Pounds
1.86 a week in the second for accepting the change.
Mr Tony Woodley, the national motor industry secretary of the TGWU general
union, said: 'That means that almost all workers will be getting between 9.2
and 11.1 per cent over the two years, with most getting 10.7 per cent.'
Mr Woodley said he would recommend the deal for acceptance in a ballot of
union members.
He also said that he would be informing his German union colleagues. I G
Metall, the motor industry union, puts in its claim for this year's
engineering industry pay round next week.
But I G Metall in Frankfurt said last night: 'Rover may now be a German
company but circumstances are still very different in the two countries.'

FT  08 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Conglomerates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Conglomerates have become extremely unfashionable. The diversified
industrial sector - dominated by Hanson and BTR - has underperformed sharply
in the latest market downturn.
The worst under-performance followed the margin squeeze displayed in BTR's
half-year figures last month, but there is general perception that the
sector has gone irredeemably ex-growth. BTR and Hanson are too big to do
deals substantial enough to generate the superior earnings growth of the
past. The Accounting Standard Board has stamped out opportunities for
boosting post-acquisition profits through fair value adjustments and other
ruses. Conglomerates are suffering in today's low-inflation environment,
unable to force up prices when the cost of raw materials is rising.
It is unfair to tar all companies with the same brush. Hanson's problems are
not identical to those of BTR; its exposure to coal, timber and chemicals
makes it more dependent on commodities prices. Tomkins and Williams Holdings
have redefined what it means to be a conglomerate; Williams' new focus has
earned it a premium rating stripped from Tomkins after its opportunistic
acquisition of Ranks Hovis McDougall. Wassall's high rating demonstrates
that acquisitive conglomerates can still win City favour, if they can find
earnings-enhancing acquisitions. But Hanson and BTR must rely for their
chief attraction on above average yields.

FT  08 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Investment banking
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The job cuts and hiring freezes announced this week in the City and on Wall
Street will provide some relief to investment banks in a difficult year, but
they are not the complete answer to the industry's problems. Action is also
needed to link pay more closely to performance and to reduce the capital
devoted to the industry. The snag is that neither will be easy.
Most banks pay lip service to the idea that pay should consist of a small
fixed element and a potentially large but variable bonus. In that way, costs
would fluctuate in line with revenue and profits would be less volatile. But
banks are scared that, if they forcibly introduce such flexibility, they
will lose their best employees. Rivals have shown themselves ready to offer
star brokers and traders fixed-term contracts and guaranteed bonuses.
A reduction in the capital employed in the industry would be an even better
way of boosting profits. Bankers complain that margins in formerly lucrative
markets such as derivatives have been squeezed as competition has hotted up.
Prospects would improve if weaker groups such as Kidder Peabody were driven
from the industry. The problem is that, for every Kidder, there is a
deep-pocketed commercial bank keen to expand its investment banking
presence. Banks therefore seem left with the option of crossing their
fingers and hoping for markets to recover. But if the structural problems
are not dealt with now, they will return to haunt them in the next downturn.

FT  08 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Labour's policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's debate this week about its commitment to public ownership was
irrelevant for British industry. Nationalising privatised companies would
not be a priority for a Labour government. There are other means of
controlling such groups. The conference rhetoric of Labour luminaries was
primarily aimed at the utilities. In practice, the gas and water groups,
burdened by infrastructure programmes and negative cash flow, are less at
risk, but the regional electricity companies, weighed down with cash,
swelling profits and bulging chairmen's wage packets, are in the
firing-line. A windfall tax is a distinct possibility. The Recs' managements
can see the risk of a populist administration raiding their balance sheets.
The argument that they should do nothing, leaving shareholders to gauge the
political risk, is inadequate. They would be better to use their cash to
enhance shareholder value now, either through dividends or buying back
shares more aggressively. A one-off special dividend has tax advantages, but
involves political dangers. Buying back additional shares is a measure which
politicians and tabloid headline writers have difficulty lambasting.
If Labour is looking for unpopular companies to target for windfall taxes,
it could well turn to the clearing banks, criticised last year for not fully
passing on interest rate cuts. A windfall tax would scarcely damage their
ability to do business. Such a measure could even be imposed before 1997.
After all, the last government to impose such a tax on banks was led by Lady
Thatcher.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having spent most of the week convulsed with jitters, financial markets took
yesterday's US employment data with remarkable calm. September's rise in
non-farm payrolls may have been slightly below market expectations but there
is no mistaking the strong underlying economic trend. Headline unemployment
is below 6 per cent which brings it close to the level at which inflation
threatens by almost any definition. The size of the workforce in July and
August was also revised upwards, which will doubtless be reflected in
capacity use figures when they are published on Friday. In short, there is
still every reason to expect a further interest rate rise soon.
Perhaps the markets' calm yesterday simply reflected the fact that they were
oversold before the announcement. But the truth remains that there can be no
lasting recovery, at least, in the bond markets until investors are
convinced the Federal Reserve has done enough to cool the economy and keep
inflation under control. It would help if the next rate rise was aggressive,
but the upward revision to the third-quarter payrolls suggests several more
rate rises may be needed after that.
Amid the confusion engendered by the renewed tension in Kuwait, it is
difficult what to make of the slight recovery of the dollar against the yen.
It is just possible, though, that the dollar's rise above Y100 reflects the
beginning of capital outflows out of Japan. Traditionally yield conscious
Japanese investors must find US bond yields of 8 per cent attractive. If so,
the market may be able to cope with rising short term rates more easily than
hitherto.

economic data
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks moved higher yesterday, with investors consoled that a crucial
measure of economic strength came in below expectations, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 21.87 better at 3,797.43, and the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 2.74 at 455.10. The American
SE composite added 1.52 at 455.12 while the Nasdaq composite outperformed
the lot with a gain of 5.77 to 749.96.
On the NYSE, advancing issues outnumbered declines by a four-to-three margin
on moderate volume of 284m shares.
Amid a week of fretting in the financial markets, the Labor Department
disclosed that fewer workers had been hired in September than most
economists had forecast. Non-farm payrolls grew by 239,000, against a
consensus estimate of about 260,000.
Even though the August increase in payrolls was revised sharply higher, the
tame headline figure allowed bond prices to stabilise and push higher late
in the day. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue receded after
touching the worrisome 8.00 per cent level just before the release of the
jobs data.
But the relief was qualified, at best. The news seemed likely to avert an
immediate move by the Federal Reserve to put up interest rates, but a
tightening did not appear to be too far in future.
Stocks opened with decent gains, but second guessing among investors quickly
pulled the leading indices into negative territory. Towards midday, share
prices followed bonds higher again, powered by across-the-board gains in
oil-related issues.
The sector's improvement had nothing to do with the economy or monetary
policy. With reports of Iraqi troop movements near the Kuwait border and a
subsequent upturn in crude prices, Exxon gained Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 58
1/4 , Texaco Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 61 1/8 and Chevron Dollars 1 to
Dollars 48 5/8 .
IBM, the NYSE's most active issue, also contributed to the Dow's advance.
The stock jumped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 71 1/4 on reports that the
computer maker had sold out its new Aptiva line through the end of the year.
On the Nasdaq, Broderbund Software surged Dollars 5 1/8 to Dollars 57 1/2 .
Oppenheimer lifted its rating on the issue after the company posted a 51 per
cent increase in earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter.
Biogen was marked up Dollars 5 1/2 or 11 per cent to Dollars 54 3/4 . The
big gain followed news that Schering and Rentschler, two German
pharmaceuticals houses, had agreed to develop and market Beta-interferon
jointly.
The deal was viewed by Wall Street as beneficial to Biogen, which is
developing a different form of the drug to treat multiple sclerosis.

Toronto stocks staged an afternoon rally and closed higher, but many
analysts remain cautious about the outlook for next week.
The TSE 300 composite index 14.48 points to close at 4,290.80 in modest
volume of 49.63m shares.
Mr Ron Meisels, president of P and C Holdings, said that bargain-hunters and
a rash of traders were covering their short positions so that they can go
into the long Thanksgiving weekend in a neutral position and were the main
drivers behind the rise.

FT  08 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Deng health reports put
Shanghai on switchback ride

<TEXT>
Share prices gained ground thanks to small lot buying by overseas investors
and improved confidence on the fall in the yen against the dollar, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index rose 89.52 to 19,744.75, up 0.9 per cent on the week.
The index opened at the day's low of 19,689.84 and rose to a high of
19,753.65 in the afternoon session.
The dollar's recovery to a one-month high triggered buying of export
oriented stocks, which led other shares.
Volume totaled 226m shares against 202m. Most investors were absent from
trading ahead of the three day weekend.
The Topix index of all first section stocks added 1.78 to 1,578.05 and the
Nikkei 300 advanced 0.31 to 289.11. Gainers outnumbered declines 496 to 428,
with 232 issues remaining unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index closed 3.32 down at 1,306.56.
Traders said that sentiment was supported by a rush of subscribers to
Matsushita Electric Industrial's Y200bn convertible bond issue. Many market
participants had initially feared that the large lot offering would take
funds out of the equity market but favourable terms, including the coupon
and low conversion price, helped attract investors.
Reports that the Ministry of Finance will not release Japan Tobacco which
have not been subscribed for, in conjunction with the stock listing on
October 27, also cheered investors. Although the ministry denied that a
formal decision had been made, the news helped dissipate some pessimism over
the flotation.
However Japan Telecom, which is closely followed by investors looking to buy
Japan Tobacco shares, declined Y90,000 to Y3.92m. DDI, another telecom
operator followed suit, losing Y13,000 to Y865,000. Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone shed Y6,000 to Y865,000 and East Japan Railway lost Y2,000 to
Y475,000.
High-technology stocks, on the other hand, were higher on the weaker yen.
Hitachi, the most active issue of the day, rose Y17 to Y990 and Mitsubishi
Electric added Y17 to Y722.
Steel companies fell on profit taking. Nippon Steel fell Y2 to Y379 and NKK
declined Y6 to Y281.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 18.02 to 22,008.11 in volume of 11.7m shares.
Nintendo, the video game maker, rose Y50 to Y5,400 on the easier yen.
Roundup
Rumours concerning the health of China's leader and unconfirmed reports of
Iraqi troop movements made for a volatile day's trading in parts of the
Pacific Rim.
SHANGHAI's A share index took a switchback ride, plunging almost 18.0 per
cent in the early afternoon on rumours that China's leader, Deng Xiaoping,
was ill, before picking up to close 12.4 per cent higher as the rumours
subsided.
The index finished up 83.32 to 735.86, off an intra-day low of 544.00 and a
high of 781.27 minutes before the close. Rumours about Deng's health were
one of the the main factors behind a 28.5 per cent fall over the the
previous four trading days.
The volatility of the day's trade prompted allegations of institutional
manipulation of the market while the late surge was said to have been
assisted by unconfirmed stories that China would allow pension funds to
enter the A market.
HONG KONG reversed steep morning losses at the finish, inspired by the
Shanghai bourse's sharp rebound.
The Hang Seng index closed 8.63 higher at 9,284.88, having picked up from a
day's low of 9,194.40. The market was 2.5 per cent down over the week.
Investors continued to await US September jobs data and the response to
sales of Cheung Kong's Bayshore Towers flats, which were priced below
expectations.
KUALA LUMPUR was 1.9 per cent lower after an Iraqi opposition group said in
London that Iraq was mobilising elite troops towards Kuwait.
An Iraqi embassy official in Brussels subsequently denied the allegations,
but by then, the damage has been done.
The composite index fell 21.10 to 1,122.33, erasing the 18 point advance of
the previous two sessions and leaving the index 0.6 per cent per cent higher
over the week.
SINGAPORE was also lower in choppy dealings in a late reaction to the
reports about Iraqi troops movements.
The Straits Times Industrials index lost 3.22 to 2,330.09, little changed on
the week, with profit-taking ahead of the US jobs data also contributing to
the slide.
TAIPEI ended a volatile day slightly lower, but brokers said the effects of
the share payment default that had dragged the market down by 7 per cent
over the previous two days had almost come to an end.
The weighted index finished 32.96 lower at 6,620.36, 6.6 per cent down on
the week, in active turnover of TDollars 70.8bn.
Hualon-related stocks remained weak. Hualon Corp and Chia Hsin Live both
fell by the daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars 21.3 and TDollars 22.7
respectively.
BANGKOK closed lower but off the day's low on late buying of bank issues,
the SET index ending 21.72 lower at 1,459.78, down 1.7 per cent on the week
in turnover of Bt6.96bn.
SYDNEY eased further on interest rate fears, the All Ordinaries index losing
8.8 at 1,967.5, off 3 per cent on the week.
WELLINGTON registered its fifth loss in five days, Fletcher Challenge
leading the way down as the NZSE-40 index fell 10.11 to 1,988.05, 3.8 per
cent lower on the week, in turnover of NZDollars 62.6m.
SEOUL swung to a lower close on late afternoon institutional selling, the
composite index finishing 4.09 down at 1,065.84, 1.5 per cent up on the
week, after a morning high of 1,081.14.
BOMBAY, spurred by active speculative buying in moderate volume trade at the
beginning of the new account, saw the BSE index close 70.21 points higher at
4,449.70, 3.9 per cent better over the week.
MANILA enjoyed lower September inflation, a new wave of IPOs and strong
foreign participation, and the composite index rose 19.67 to 2,997.16, up
3.1 per cent on the week.
JAKARTA gained 3.4 per cent on the week as the official index closed another
upbeat day, 3.59 higher at 515.05

FT  08 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Apprehension ahead of US data
turns to relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The story of the week and of this year, apprehension ahead of US economic
data, turned to relief yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
US payrolls growth came in below expectations. Reports that Iraqi troops
were moving towards Kuwait put an dampener on bourse proceedings early in
the afternoon but, later, lifted crude prices, and some of the oil majors in
Europe.
FRANKFURT ended slightly lower on the session, registering a new 1994
official closing low for the third day in a row. The Dax index fell 0.44 to
1,960.59, 2.5 per cent down on the week in turnover up from DM6.4bn to
DM6.6bn.
After hours the picture improved, the Ibis-indicated Dax moving 12.26 higher
to 1,977.67 over 24 hours. Stars of the day included shares recently
depressed, like the inter-related Deutsche Bank and Metallgesellschaft,
which recovered DM21.30 to DM696.20, and DM11 to DM139 respectively.
Analysts attributed the Deutsche Bank gain to restructuring measures, aimed
at helping the bank gain a better market position. Metallgesellschaft said
yesterday that its bank debts shrank to DM4.1bn by the end of 1993-1994 from
DM7.6bn a year earlier.
Schering, moved recently by prospects for its BetaSeron multiple sclerosis
drug, fell DM25 to DM895, maintaining its weakness throughout the day.
Analysts said that the shares reacted to news that Biogen, the US
biotechnology company, would be producing data on its own ms drug in San
Francisco on Monday.
PARIS was looking at yet another new 1994 low at one stage in the day as the
CAC 40 index fell to 1,825.36, but it posted a technical rebound to close
13.00 higher at 1,856.38, 1.2 per cent lower on the week, in turnover of
FFr2.83bn.
Oils moved with the Kuwait news and crude prices, Elf Aquitaine rising
FFr7.50 to FFr373.30, and Total by FFr7.90 to FFr314. The water companies,
Generale des Eaux and Lyonnaise des Eaux, put on FFr13.90 at FFr481.90 and
FFr9.90 to FFr488.40 as the political bears ended hostilities for the time
being.
However, the scandal-tainted stocks did not all have a good day. Schneider,
which has been at odds with the Belgian authorities, fell FFr8.10 to
FFr371.90 on apparently good half year figures, after rising FFr6.60 in
advance of them on Thursday.
MILAN resumed its slide, losing 2.2 per cent, as the conflict between the
government and the judiciary deepened. The real time Mibtel index fell 222
to 10,094 with news of a search by fiscal police on the offices of Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's Fininvest group providing the day's installment of drama. The
index lost 6.9 per cent over the week.
One Milan dealer commented that the market was trading in conditions of
'huge political confusion'. He added that mutual funds data earlier in the
week indicated that equity funds already had near-record portfolios and were
unwilling to commit fresh cash while all but the most speculative of foreign
investors were keeping a low profile.
Ferruzzi fell L64 or 4.4 per cent to L1380, after a low of L1,350, and
Montedison was L34 or 2.7 per cent down at L1,213, after a low of L1,138.
The declines followed rumours, denied by the companies, of forthcoming
capital increases.
ZURICH finished higher in the wake of the US data, and the SMI index rose
12.1 to 2,496.9, but was down 1.5 per cent on the week.
Investors turned the spotlight on insurers on the perception that after
developments at Swiss Re, more of the smaller companies could become
takeover targets. Swiss Re added SFr11 to SFr699. Baloise rose SFr50 to
SFr2,645 and Berner, in which Germany's Allianz has a 30 per cent stake,
rose SFr150 or 12.2 per cent to SFr1,380.
AMSTERDAM recovered from early weakness ahead of US employment data, helped
by the bond market's subsequent recovery and Wall Street's firmer opening.
The AEX index closed up 2.09 at 392.87, but still 2.3 per cent lower on the
week.
Royal Dutch Petroleum was Fl 2.30 at Fl 187.50 as oil prices rose on the
Kuwait reports.
Some cyclical issues moved higher in a technical correction after recent
falls, but chemicals were weak.
Hoogovens rose Fl 1.80 to Fl 74.10 but Akzo Nobel closed down 70 cents at Fl
196.10 and DSM was 60 cents lower at Fl 137.10.
HELSINKI, closing early, was hit by sharp falls in the telecoms-based
conglomerate, Nokia, and in forestry shares, the Hex index closing 38.7, or
2.1 per cent lower at 1,831.8, 3 per cent down on the week. Nokia dropped
FM14 to FM525.

FT  08 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa golds recover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
South African gold shares snapped a four-day losing streak as bullion showed
early signs of recovery, but a late dip in the metal pulled them off their
highs.
The gold index finished 29 points better at 2,356 after anearlier rise to
2,377. Industrials shed 9 to 6,261, dealers saying that investors had
avoided the market in spite of an early rise on Wall Street; the overall
index was 3 better at 5,597.
Traders said gold shares had bounced in reaction to recent losses, but had
also found renewed support from speculators looking for a commercial rand
decline if the financial rand is abolished.
De Beers ended 50 cents better at R101 after an initial rise to R102. Anglos
shed R1 to R233 and JCI added R1.50 to R106. Gencor rose 15 cents to R14.75.
Pick'n Pay continued under pressure, losing 10 cents to R9.50.

FT  08 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs alert
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in the regional electricity companies fell sharply during early
trading as Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, highlighted the possibility of a
one-off tax on the National Grid disposal, but they subsequently rallied
strongly after London Electricity bought in seven per cent of its shares.
Helping fuel the bullish run by the stocks in the afternoon was news that
Eastern Electricity had called an analysts meeting for Monday afternoon. The
move was seen by dealers as indicating a possible share buy-back on Monday
morning, a potential series of big cost cutting measures or even a takeover
move against one of the other recs.
Eastern is the only Rec to have received shareholder permission to buy in up
to 14.9 per cent of its shares, in this case, some 38m shares. Eastern
shares jumped 19 to 761p as the news filtered into the market.
London's broker, SG Warburg Securities bought the 15.3m London shares at
672p a share, in a move similar to that carried out for Northern Electricity
and Midlands Electricity recently. London shares closed 2 off at 683p with
turnover expanding rapidly to 33m following the share purchases by Warburg.
Newspaper group Telegraph jumped sharply after parent group Hollinger said
it intended to increase its shareholding. The Canadian media group said it
was confident of the prospects of the Telegraph and intended to buy up to
6.8m shares, taking its stake to 62 per cent from 57 per cent. The news
offset a warning from the Telegraph that operating profits in the third
quarter would be hit by the newspaper price wars. The shares leapt 45 before
closing 20 better at 330p.
Hard on the heels of Thursday's James Capel downgrade story Barclays Bank
shares fell further, losing 8 more to 542p, after 539p, on stories that UBS
is preparing a sell note on the stock and also on rumours circulating in the
market that the bank has suffered from substantial losses in proprietary
trading.
Bank of Scotland managed a minor gain at 194p after Smith New Court executed
a bought deal involving 4m shares bought for 187p each and placed at 188p.
Vague rights issue talk also resurfaced at T&amp;N, leaving the shares 2 1/2
lower 209 1/2 p as the market speculated on the outcome of the company's
plan for an enhanced scrip issue dividend.
Terms for the scrip are due to be announced towards the end of this month
with the Dollars 47m savings to T&amp;N underpinning its purchase of control of
a controlling stake in German motor components group Kolbenschmidt.
Lucas Industries lost ground ahead of Monday's full-year results, retreating
5 to 177p as rights issue rumours swirled around the shares which stood at
196p a week ago.
Turnover was relatively light at 3m trades and the consensus among analysts
was that although sizeable restructuring provisions could well emerge on
Monday, talk of an imminent financing move by the company was misplaced.
P&amp;0 stood out among lacklustre transport shares, falling 6 to 596p in
negligible trading volume. The shares have underperformed the market by 3
per cent over the past month and one top securities is known to be teeing up
a buy recommendation.
Eurotunnel shed a further 5 to 248p as traders digested the implications of
a substantial stock overhang in the shape of the 29m shares held by

FT  08 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Switch in busy oil sector
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil stocks, one of the quietest areas of the market in recent months as
investors have focused on interest rate sensitive areas, suddenly moved
centre stage, providing some of the biggest individual trades yesterday and
also responding to developments in the Middle East.
Reports of big Iraqi troop manoeuvres close to the Kuwaiti border helped
crude oil prices move up, stimulating all sorts of activity in oil shares
which were already responding to strong overnight buying from the US.
The biggest move in the market involved one institution switching its entire
holding of Enterprise Oil into BP. The switch was said to have been carried
out by NatWest Securities and involved 7.4m Enterprise shares, some 1.5 per
cent of the group, and 7.1m BP shares. Speculation as to the seller of the
block of Enterprise centred on the Prudential, Scottish Widows and Legal &amp;
General insurance companies .
Enterprise shares have performed badly this year retreating from a 1994 high
of 457p, reached around two weeks before its ultimately unsuccessful bid
move against fellow oil exploration group Lasmo.
BP shares, on the other hand, have gone from strength to strength hitting a
record 430p last month, as the market responded to the company's strong
earnings recovery and a string of exploration successes.
BP were additionally helped by talk of a buy recommendation from Cazenove
and on hints of further exploration success west of the Shetlands.
At the close BP were 9 higher at 415 1/2 p on turnover of 20m shares while
Enterprise settled 7 off at 386p with 15m traded.

FT  08 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Firm close for equities as bonds
advance again - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A firm performance from bond prices again helped UK equities move higher to
challenge the FT-SE 3.000 mark, brushing off a scare about reported
developments on the Kuwait border as Wall Street opened positively in the
wake of the keenly-awaited US employment data. The FT-SE 100 Share Index
closed 14.3 ahead at 2,998.7 and long dated gilt-edged stocks were around
3/4 of a point higher.
Equity trading volume remained modest but the market looked more confident
as the US employment statistics failed to dislodge an early gain which took
the Footsie to within five points of the 3,000 mark. Confidence was
challenged in the second half of the session when reports flashed across the
trading screens suggesting Iraqi troop movements on the Kuwait border.
Oil shares, and also sterling, flicked higher on the news agency reports
from the Middle East, and the Footsie gain was trimmed from 11 to 4 points
very quickly as investors pondered the implications of a renewed threat to
oil prices and bond yields as well as currencies.
But the news agency reports could not be fully sustained in UK market hours.
Markets soon settled down again, and the Footsie rallied behind a Dow
Industrial Average which added 12 points in UK trading hours.
At last night's closing reading, the Footsie Index was down just under 1 per
cent over a week which has seen the market unsettled by fears that the US
Federal Reserve may soon raise its key interest rates again. Worry over
upward pressures on global rates are focused sharply on the possibility that
UK base rates could be forced higher again before the end of the year.
But the gilt-edged market, where a recovery is seen as the necessary
requisite for a return to health in equities, has been in better form this
week. Short-dated gilts, those most closely linked to base rate perceptions,
edged forward yesterday and longer dates, more keenly aligned to views on
inflation, extended their early gains in the second half of the session.
Past weeks have seen investment cash moved from equities into gilts.
Nevertheless, sentiment remained unsettled and an erratic equity market
dipped sharply in early trading when futures selling fell on an unwilling
equity market. Next week brings a heavy list of economic data from both
sides of the Atlantic.
On the home front, investors will focus on the Retail Price Index for
September which is due, together with average earnings and wage cost
statistics, in the middle of the week. Later, markets will face the producer
price index from the US, with retail sales and consumer price figures to
follow.
Most of the action lay in the Footsie stocks yesterday, and the FT-SE Mid
250 Index was left to edge ahead by 2 points to 3,447.5. Business in
non-Footsie stocks made up only just over half of yesterday's Seaq volume
total of 512.4m shares which was nearly 12 per cent down on the previous
session. While retail business, life-blood of the big securities firms, has
remained satisfactory, it has become more narrowly focused, threatening the
financial health of the less prominent names in the market.
On Thursday, retail, or customer business, was worth Pounds 1.2bn,
maintaining the flow of profitable trading sessions for the London-based
securities industry.
In spite of the weakness of the stock market, many market strategists have
repeated relatively bullish forecasts for prospects for the F-SE 100 Index
over the final three months before the end of the year. Economic recovery,
in the form of corporate earnings and dividends is still seen the near-term
prop for the stock market, although two leading firms warned yesterday that
consumer spending might continue to face restraints both this year and next.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Dollar puzzle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ambiguous economic data in the US yesterday prevented foreign exchange
markets from getting a clear idea of the outlook for the dollar, writes
Philip Gawith.
The employment report, which the market had anxiously anticipated all week,
was such a curate's egg as to leave unresolved the question of whether
monetary policy should be further tightened.
Renewed concerns about tension in Iraq, however, supported the dollar
against the yen. The US currency closed in London at Y100.225, from Y99.75.
It was the first time in five weeks that the dollar had closed above Y100.
The dollar finished against the D-Mark at DM1.5411 from DM1.5444.
Elsewhere, the focus stayed on the Italian lira and the Finnish markka. The
Italian currency weakened after police raided the offices of prime minister
Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest company. After touching a low of L1,020
against the D-Mark, it closed at L1,018, from L1,014.
The Finnish currency maintained its recent run to reach FM3.075 against the
D-Mark, from FM3.09,and other Nordic currencies rose in its wake.
Sterling had an uneventful day, finishing at DM2.4511, from DM2.4526.
Against the dollar it closed at Dollars 1.5905 from DM1.5888.
For most analysts, it is a question of when, rather than if, the Fed next
tightens. It is now expected to wait for next week's inflation, retail sales
and industrial production data before making any move.
The outlook for the dollar against the yen is slightly different. Some
observers attribute the dollar's close above Y100 to the Iraq effect.
Tensions in the region pushed oil prices to an eight-week high, and the yen
has traditionally suffered from high oil prices.
Mr Mike Gallagher, of the financial consultancy IDEA, said a re-rating of
the yen was clearly underway. Having been firmly bullish of the currency,
the market was now more neutral, following last weekend's US-Japan trade
agreement.
This view was borne out by movement in the yen yesterday. Despite firmer
money market rates, apparently tolerated by the Bank of Japan, and hence
encouraging speculation that the BOJ might wish to raise official rates, the
yen maintained its weaker tone.
Mr Brian Marber, a technical analyst, said that by closing above Y100, the
dollar had broken the downtrend. The intermediate trend against the yen, he
said, was now up.
Against the D-Mark, however, Mr Marber was less sanguine. He said he
remained of the view that the dollar would still break downwards. He said it
had already done so against the Swiss franc, and this often tended to lead
the dollar on the downside.
He predicted that if the dollar closed below DM1.5350, breaking a pattern of
five weeks, 'it goes down a lot further'. Mr Marber said it was not
unprecedented for a currency to be rising against some currencies, while
weakening against others.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 480m assistance,
compared to a forecast shortage of Pounds 600m. Three month sterling LIBOR
was unchanged at 6 per cent. The firmer performance of gilts helped the
short sterling market, with the December contract finishing at 93.37 from
93.30.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Brazil rain hits coffee
futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee prices tumbled at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday as reports
of rain in Brazilian growing areas 'spooked' speculators holding long
positions.
The market had been set up for a big fall by an overnight plunge in New York
prices. That had been factored into London values by the midday close, when
the January position was quoted at Dollars 3,675 a tonne, down Dollars 168,
traders told the Reuters news agency. But the sellers were not yet done. As
New York prices fell still further in early business LCE futures followed
suit, and with more rain reported in Brazil the close the January price was
down at the close to Dollars 3,523 a tonne, having lost Dollars 320 on the
day and Dollars 332 on the week. At one stage it dipped to a six-week low of
Dollars 3,499 a tonne.
'There has been a lot of nervousness and people do tend to panic a little
when they have seen the rain,' one trader explained. 'If we see more rain
over the weekend, we will come in Monday and be under pressure again.'
At the London Metal Exchange copper and zinc values lost ground yesterday.
But the relatively modest declines, which dealers attributed chiefly to
profit-taking, left them both with net rises on the week.
Copper prices began on Tuesday to claw back the heavy falls suffered late
last week after an earlier strong advance boiled over. At yesterday's close
the three months delivery position stood at Dollars 2,535 a tonne a tonne,
up Dollars 44.50 overall but Dollars 43 short of last week's 3 3/4 -year
high. Scarcity of supplies available for immediate delivery kept the cash
quotation at a premium to three months.
The three months price had peaked at Dollars 2,542 a tonne early in the day
after the announcement of a big fall in LME warehouse stocks. But that had
been widely expected and the price slipped back to Dollars 2,524 before
buyers were tempted back into the market in any numbers. The sellers
regained the upper hand, however, once the afternoon ring was over. In after
hours trading the price was hovering only a few dollars above Dollars 2,500
a tonne.
'The market is still nervous after last week's sell-off and it still fears a
further wave of investor liquidation,' a trader told Reuters.
The zinc market has been lagging the other LME metals for most of this year
as continuing overproduction and, therefore, rising stocks have weighed down
sentiment. But this week the investment funds that have been so influential
in the recent strength of the copper and aluminium markets appeared to
decide that it was time for this metal to benefit from their ministrations.
A sharp price jump in mid-week was trimmed back slightly yesterday following
another rise, though a relatively modest one, in LME stocks, but at the
close the three months quotation was still showing a Dollars 40.25 rise on
the week at Dollars 1,069.75 a tonne.
Dealers suggested that the market was poised for further gains to push it
past the 20-month high reached on Thursday.
Aluminium prices meanwhile headed back towards their recent highs,
encouraged by European merchant demand. The three months afternoon ring
close of Dollars 1,651.25 a tonne yesterday, near the day's high, was up
Dollars 3.75 on the day and Dollars 33.75 on the week. But the price edged
back below Dollars 1,650 in after hours trading.
Fears of US interest rate rises put the gold price under pressure early
yesterday. But supported at Dollars 392 a troy ounce held once again.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices of black and white pepper reached record highs this week, although
the market activity was less active, reports Man Producten. Most buyers who
had no immediate need to replenish stocks adopted a 'wait-and-see' attitude.
That was quite logical after the breathtaking price rise of some 30 to 35
per cent during September for most grades of black pepper. The price of
black ASTA reached US3,100 a tonne in the US market, while in the European
market the 'faq' grade reached Dollars 2,600. White pepper prices in
Indonesia were firmer, mainly because of the expected negative influence of
very dry weather there. Spot Muntok white was at Dollars 3,500 a tonne. A
period of consolidation or even correction may now be on the cards, after
which we expect prices to continue the uptrend.

FT  08 OCT 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft cuts debt by
two-thirds to DM1.2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft has reduced its net debt by two-thirds, and made a
'precision landing' on targets set earlier this year when creditor banks
agreed a DM3.4bn (Dollars 2.2bn) rescue package, according to Mr Kajo
Neukirchen, chairman.
Debts of DM3.6bn at the end of the 1992-93 financial year had been cut to
DM1.2bn by the end of September, he said yesterday. Bank liabilities had
been reduced to DM4.1bn from DM7.6bn.
The assets sale since he took control last December had generated DM4.2bn,
and 90 subsidiaries had been disposed of or deconsolidated.
Cost savings of DM500m this year would be followed by a further DM1bn by the
end of the current financial year, when the company expects to show an
operating profit of more than DM100m.
In a scornful assessment of the synergies attributed to the old
Metallgesellschaft, Mr Neukirchen said they should not be over-estimated.
'A company which simultaneously distributes aircraft galleys, holds stakes
in bakeries and trades in developing countries' debt can only be improved by
targeted disinvestment,' he added.
Mr Neukirchen appeared to be responding to criticisms that the group has
been reduced to a mere shadow of its former self by his radical onslaught on
the alleged investment excesses wrought by his sacked predecessor, Mr Heinz
Schimmelbusch.
The company would concentrate on its core interests in trading, plant
construction, chemicals and financial services, he said.
Lead and zinc units would be rationalised further, and the environmental
divisions would be tightened. The company would withdraw from loss-making
recycling and environmental cleaning operations.

FT  08 OCT 94 / International Company News: Disney to introduce French films
to US cinema-goers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mickey Mouse may soon be blushing in embarrassment, thanks to an attempt by
his masters to bring the gems of the French cinema to American audiences in
readily digestible form.
Euro Disney, the French-based theme park owner, said yesterday that Mr
Philippe Bourguignon, chairman, had decided to set up a new subsidiary of
Miramax, owned by Walt Disney, which would promote French films in the US.
Mr Bourguignon, who had the idea but will not be directly involved in
managing the company, said the aim was to release at least three French
films a year in the US.
Asked whether some of the more sensuous French films would be on offer uncut
to American mass market tastes - often considered more prudish - Euro Disney
said no decisions had been taken on the types of film to be supported.
It said the new company aimed to dub four existing French films into English
by 1996, in an attempt to broaden the audience of European cinema away from
a minority 'elite type of viewer' prepared to read sub-titles.
The subsidiary may also threaten the dominance of a few leading French
actors, such as Gerard Depardieu, by taking an active part in casting French
actors in Miramax film productions.
Euro Disney - which has been criticised for being too American in outlook
for its European customers - lost no opportunity to emphasise the French
image of the initiative.
It said the company would be based in Paris and would be headed Ms Agnes
Matre, vice-president of Miramax.
The company admitted that Euro Disney wanted to build its own, international
identity, but stressed the reason behind the move was purely 'a business
decision' and that 'we should focus on and retain our Disney roots'.
The new company intends to work on about five European productions a year
and set up co-productions with French producers.

The Italian treasury last night carried out a management shake-up at INA,
the Italian insurance group, in advance of the final phase of the sell-off
the state's final 49 per cent tranche.
Using its powers as majority shareholder, the treasury has appointed 10 of
the 13 strong board as envisaged in INA's statutes prior to the sale in June
of the government's 51 per cent stake for L4,900bn. Mr Lorenzo Pallesi, the
chief executive who steered the privatisation road show, has been eased out
in spite of having been confirmed in his post five months ago when the
Berlusconi government took office.
The treasury said the new board had been composed in consultation with INA's
new shareholders. But not all the shareholders may be happy with the
reshuffle as there is an unwritten rule that managements do not change
during the course of privatisations. Two-thirds of the offering in June was
bought by North American and British institutions.

The improvement in results at SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian semiconductor
manufacturer, continued in the second quarter with profits increasing 47 per
cent to Dollars 86.5m.
The second-quarter rise took first-half net profits to Dollars 166.1m,
slightly above the figure for the whole of 1993. The first half of the
group's financial year ended at the beginning of July.
The company, formed in 1987 through the merger of Thomson Semiconductor of
France and Italy's SGS Microelectronics, said the improvement in results
reflected the buoyancy of the international semiconductor market, the
introduction of products and increased productivity.
The strong demand for semiconductors and related products was reflected in
sales of Dollars 1.27bn, a rise of 32 per cent over the comparable period in
1993. In the second quarter, revenues amounted to Dollars 672m.
SGS-Thomson said all of its principal product groups increased sales in the
second quarter, while bookings during the period were described as strong.
The company's principal markets include semiconductors for use in telecoms,
computers and control systems.
Its principal geographical markets in Europe, the Americas and Asia Pacific,
reported increased turnover.

FT  08 OCT 94 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais reduces
first-half charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais, the financially-troubled French banking group, reduced the
level of provisions it was planning to make for the first half of the year
by more than FFr1bn (Dollars 180m) after last-minute discussions with
regulators.
This reduced the overall level of provisions to FFr10.1bn. Many analysts
believe this is only about half the level that will be required to cope with
the legacy of non-performing loans inherited from the bank's activities over
the past few years.
Banking sources suggested yesterday that planned provisions in the six
months to June 30 on its exposure to activities in other countries were
reduced by up to FFr2bn after discussions between Credit Lyonnais officers,
its new auditors and the French banking commission and state auditing
commission.
The reduction partly reflects the tensions between Mr Jean Peyrelevade, the
chairman of the bank appointed by the government last year, and the
economics and finance ministry, which has been resisting the bank's demands
for additional state support against outstanding potential liabilities.
Government sources suggested this month that Mr Peyrelevade had originally
told Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economics minister, that Credit Lyonnais
would require provisions of up to FFr25bn.
Officials have demanded far more detailed and justified quantification of
potential provisions before providing public assurance that they would
underwrite the losses this may cause.
The bank has been under pressure to sell off core activities as well as
industrial investments, although it remains committed to maintaining its
European network, which includes about 1,000 branches outside France and
2,200 within the country.
It emerged yesterday that Credit Lyonnais was poised to appoint a new member
to its executive committee with special responsibilities for internal
management support in the restructuring operations.
Mr Pascal Lamy, previously director of Mr Jacques Delors' cabinet in
Brussels, is reviewing operations within the bank, and is expected shortly
to become the fourth member of the committee alongside Mr Peyrelevade, Mr
Michel Renault and Mr Dominique Bazy.

ITT, the US conglomerate which owns the Sheraton hotel chain, is expected to

hotels group, following an agreed bid, writes Andrew Hill in Milan.
Sources said yesterday the US group could end up with as much as 55 per cent
of Ciga, ending a year-long struggle for full control of the troubled hotels
group. The ITT offer closed on Friday night and details of the outcome
should be disclosed after the weekend.
ITT already owns 35.25 per cent of Ciga.

FT  08 OCT 94 / International Company News: Hollinger to raise Telegraph
stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in The Telegraph jumped 20p to 330p in London yesterday after
Hollinger, the Canadian publishing company controlled by Mr Conrad Black,
said it would seek to increase its 57 per cent stake in the UK newspaper
group.
Hollinger said it would begin purchasing any available stock 'at or around
current market prices' from the start of trading on Monday.
Hollinger said it 'is prepared initially to buy up to 6.8m ordinary shares,'
which would account for about 5 per cent of The Telegraph's shares.
At yesterday's close, the exercise would cost Hollinger more than Pounds 22m
(Dollars 34.76m).
The move is likely to excite further controversy over Mr Black's dealings
with The Telegraph. In May, Hollinger reduced its stake in The Telegraph to
57 per cent from 66.2 per cent, raising CDollars 152m (USDollars 113.4m),
only weeks before the The Daily Telegraph cut its cover price as a price war
erupted in Britain's newspaper industry. The share price consequently
slumped to 332p from 540p. A London Stock Exchange inquiry cleared Mr Black
of any wrongdoing, although Cazenove, the company's broker, later resigned.
Yesterday, Mr Jack Boultbee, Hollinger vice-president, said: 'Conrad Black
stated before that if the price was right he would buy Telegraph shares;
that's just what he's done.
'We think The Telegraph represents one of the better long-term investments
around at the moment. We are committed investors and will not turn around
and re-sell this when the shares move up to, say, Pounds 5.'
On the controversy surrounding the group's last dealings in The Telegraph,
he said: 'Buying these shares isn't going to improve our image in the City
of London. Only time will do that. But we're doing this because it's a darn
good investment.' But he added Hollinger would have begun buying several
weeks ago had there not been a conflict.
Analysts speculated that the Hollinger statement could signal an end to the
newspaper price war. 'The feeling is that The Times will increase its price
in the next few months, which would allow everyone else to move theirs
upwards too,' said one broker. The Times, owned by News Corporation, is the
cheapest quality broadsheet paper.
However, Mr Stephen Grabena, managing director of The Telegraph, denied the
Hollinger move would be followed by an increase in The Daily Telegraph's
price. 'We have no plans to change the cover price in the foreseeable
future.'

<TEXT>
Sun Hung Kai Properties, one of Hong Kong's leading property developers and
controlled by the Kwok family, yesterday posted a 32 per cent increase in
net profits to HKDollars 8.8bn (USDollars 1.1bn) for the year to June 30.
This is in line with market expectations and compares with HKDollars 6.7bn
for the previous year.
Earnings were struck on the back of HKDollars 15.2bn in sales, 48 per cent
up on the previous year's HKDollars 10.3bn.
Following Henderson Land, the developer which reported on Wednesday, Sun
Hung Kai Properties is awarding a special cash bonus to mark the 'very
satisfactory' results.
Shareholders are to receive a bonus of 38 cents a share on top of the final
dividend of HKDollars 1.01 a share. This gives a total annual payout of
HKDollars 1.92 a share, 25 per cent up on the previous year (adjusted for a
capitalisation issue).
Earnings a share rose 24 per cent to HKDollars 3.91 from HKDollars 3.16.
Sun Hung Kai Properties is the last of the colony's big developers to
report, and its figures confirm the sector's ability to weather the storms
of 1994, which have included government measures to cool property prices and
rising interest rates.
Mr Walter Kwok, chairman and chief executive, said that while residential
property prices had tumbled between 15 per cent and 20 per cent from the
highs in the first quarter of the year, end-users were gradually returning
to the market and prices were stabil-ising.
'Strong demand for housing is expected to continue as a result of
sustainable growth in household income. The fundamental factors underpinning
the residential market remain unchanged, though interest rate movements need
to be monitored,' he said.

'Demand will remain healthy for the foreseeable future, but there will be a
cooling off as more capacity comes on stream and as the cycle peaks,' said
an electronics analyst.
SGS-Thomson said it had continued to invest heavily in new equipment and
facilities, particularly in France, Italy and the US. However, the
debt-to-equity ratio was maintained at about 25 per cent, according to the
group.

Dawson Home Fashions, the shower curtain and bathroom accessories subsidiary

manufacturing and distribution.
The move forms part of DHF's plans, announced in June, to return to
profitability. In the year March 26 1994 it made pre-tax losses of Pounds
2.9m on turnover of Pounds 57.3m, compared with profits of Pounds 4.6m on
turnover of Pounds 59.5m.
DHF's Vienna, Ohio plant will be phased out and consolidated into the
Sardis, Mississippi facility, with the loss of 250 jobs. There was a Pounds
12m provision for restructuring in Dawson International's accounts for the
year which the company continues to believe will be adequate.

FT  08 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Dartmoor Investment Tst launches bid for
Sphere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dartmoor Investment Trust yesterday launched a bid for Sphere, a split
capital investment trust due to be wound up in a year's time.
Sphere is treating the bid as hostile and has recommended that shareholders
take no action as yet. However, Dartmoor appears to have a majority in
favour of its offer, which values the shares and warrants in question at
Pounds 52.45m. It owns 7.01 per cent of the income and residual capital
shares; other funds run by the same manager, Exeter Asset Management, own a
further 22.51 per cent, and have indicated acceptance of the offer.
Indications of acceptance have also been received from Abtrust Fund
Managers, which owns 22.94 per cent of the shares. This would give Dartmoor
52.46 per cent of the shares, but the acceptances are not yet irrevocable.
The bid is only for one class of share - income and residual capital - and
the warrants. It offers eight new Dartmoor ordinary shares for every 20
Sphere shares, and one new Dartmoor warrant for every four Sphere warrants,
which at October 6 prices values the Sphere shares at 42.7p and the warrants
at 5.5p. The October 6 mid-market prices were 42.5p and 5.5p respectively.
Sphere shares are trading at about asset value, and yield about 10 per cent,
while Dartmoor shares are trading at a premium of about 25 per cent, and
yield about 11 per cent. The offer would give Sphere shareholders a
continuing, increased income stream but possibly a lower capital value.
Dartmoor is not bidding for Sphere's zero dividend and cumulative preference
shares, which account for about Pounds 100m of the Pounds 150m fund.
The board of Sphere announced several months ago that it was looking at
options to extend the life of the trust but it has not yet made any
proposals. The bid will put pressure on it to do so.
The deal would allow Sphere's managers, Marathon Asset Management, to retain
the contract until the wind-up.

FT  08 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Bluebird founder pockets Pounds 2.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Polly Pocket and Mighty Max are pocket sized and mighty small - but they
mean Big Money. Yesterday, Mr Torquil Norman, founder and chairman of
Bluebird Toys, cashed in on their success with the world's children and
halved his stake in the group.
He sold 1.08m ordinary shares at 207p each, while his wife sold 120,000
shares, netting the couple almost Pounds 2.5m.
The Bluebird shares, which closed yesterday unchanged at 213p, were placed
with institutions through SG Warburg.
Mr Norman, whose lifelong hobby is flying classic aircraft, retains 1.03m
shares, or 2.3 per cent of the shares in issue. He last sold shares in June,
placing 275,000 through Smith New Court Securities, the group's broker at
the time.
He is not proposing any further sales for a year.
Earlier this year Mr Norman, who founded Bluebird Toys in 1980, stood down
as the company's chief executive. He said he would retain the chairmanship
and concentrate on new product development.
Mr Christopher Burgin, who spent 18 years with Hasbro, the US toys and games
group, was appointed chief executive with a brief to concentrate on
marketing the group's toys.
Last week Mr Burgin purchased 15,000 shares at 237p, taking his holding to
25,000 shares.
The biggest shareholder in Bluebird remains Fransad Investissements &amp;
Gestion, ultimately owned by UBS.
Fransad's shareholding has been reduced from 29.6 per cent two years ago to
18.8 per cent.
Last month the group announced interim pre-tax profits more than trebled
from Pounds 1.99m to Pounds 7.19m and declared its first interim dividend.
Turnover increased from Pounds 23.7m to Pounds 40.7m, with overseas sales 84
per cent up at Pounds 28.7m and UK sales ahead 49 per cent at Pounds 12m.
City analysts are expecting full-year profits for Bluebird of about Pounds
19m, and earnings per share of 26p.

FT  08 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Calluna seeks USM float via placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Calluna, a Scottish company which designs and manufacturers miniature hard
disk drives, is seeking a flotation through a placing on the Unlisted
Securities Market later this month.
It hopes to raise between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m mainly to boost working
capital and step up production. The placing is sponsored by Albert E Sharp.
Calluna makes high capacity 1.8' disk drives - the size of a credit card -
which can be inserted into slots conforming to the PCMCIA industry standard
in the latest generation of personal computers. The drives enable computer
users to expand their storage capacity, transport data and remove large
amounts of data from PCs for security reasons.
The company was founded in Glenrothes, Fife, in 1991 by six former employees
of Rodime, a Glenrothes-based company which produced the world's first 3.5'
hard drive in 1983 but later gave up manufacturing.
Calluna developed the world's first 1.8' hard disk drive capable of storing
more than 80 megabytes of data. It makes 130MB and 170MB drives and will
soon launch a 260MB product, all under the Callunacard name. It has
arrangements with distribution companies in Europe and the US.
Calluna raised Pounds 5m in December 1992 from 3i and other institutions and
in March this year Albert E Sharp attracted investors who put in about
Pounds 2m. In the year to March 31 1994 Calluna lost Pounds 2.1m on sales of
Pounds 300,000.
The Scottish company, which employs 40 people, is the only producer of
miniature disk drives in Europe, but faces competition from three rivals in
the US, the established disk drive maker Maxtor and two recent startups.
It believes the market for miniature disk drives is poised for growth and
quotes an estimate by an industry analyst that worldwide shipments will rise
from 50,000 in 1993 to more than 3m units in 1997.

provisions of up to Pounds 100m, pushing it into a headline loss when it
announces its annual figures on Monday.
The speculation among City analysts is that provisions could be at least
Pounds 17m to take into account costs involved in warding off litigation in
the US over lapses of quality control on aerospace component contracts with
the Defense Department.
But the provisions could reach as high as Pounds 100m, in the opinion of
Credit Lyonnais Laing, if Mr George Simpson, the new chief executive,
embarks on a major restructuring of the group to cut costs. This may involve
job losses and a continuation of the series of plant closures which go back
to 1991-92.
Lucas's difficulties in the US are well known, but any provisions for
restructuring remain guesswork until Mr Simpson, on Monday, outlines his
strategic plans for the group.
If the provisions go as far as the highest guess, then they would push Lucas
into a pre-tax loss. Without provisions, Lucas is expected to make pre-tax
profits of more than Pounds 65m, perhaps as much as Pounds 80m, for the year
to July, compared with Pounds 50.3m in 1992-93. The dividend is forecast to
stay at 7p.
Mr Simpson, since his arrival from Rover last April, has reviewed Lucas's
activities and concluded that the group should concentrate on aerospace and
automotive. The first priority, he has made clear, is to improve the group's
financial performance.
The plans, foreshadowed last week when Lucas put a software company up for
sale and said it was considering the sale of a manufacturing systems
consultancy, will also involve a new round of disposals. These are expected
largely to be companies in what was the group's applied technology division.

FT  08 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Float puts miracle in new orbit - Alice
Rawsthorn considers BSkyB's plans for reducing its debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There can be few people involved with business start-ups who do not dream of
the day when their company will go public. But for British Sky
Broadcasting's management the prospect must at times have seemed little
short of miraculous.
The short, but turbulent story of BSkyB has been one of the most exciting
media sagas of the early 1990s.
The company has, under the aegis of Mr Sam Chisholm, its abrasive chief
executive, staged a stunning recovery since the traumas of its launch in
1990 following a shotgun marriage between the struggling Sky satellite
television venture, and its ailing rival, BSB.
This week's announcement that BSkyB was considering plans to float on the
London and New York stock markets before Christmas, set the seal on its
resurgence. The flotation should also yield significant financial and
structural benefits to the company and its investors.
'BSkyB is very different today than it was a few years ago,' said Mr Richard
Brooke, its finance director. 'But some aspects of our financial structure
and ownership are more applicable to the old BSkyB than the successful
company we've become. The flotation will change that.'
One of the main incentives in going public is financial. It hopes to raise
up to Pounds 1bn by selling new shares, representing 20 per cent of the
enlarged equity, from the flotation, to be sponsored by Goldman Sachs and
Lazard Brothers. All the money will then be used to reduce its Pounds 1.7bn
debt.
None of BSkyB's four shareholders, Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation,
Granada, the UK leisure group, Chargeurs, the French textile company, and
Pearson, the UK media concern that owns the Financial Times, will sell
shares. Indeed Chargeurs intends to buy more to prevent the dilution of its
stake.
All four will benefit from the debt reduction as the proceeds will be used
to repay most of the Pounds 1.2bn tranche of debt that they provided or
guaranteed.
This strategy makes sense for the company in that the shareholder debt,
which was taken on during its early crises, is more expensive to service
than the Pounds 500m external loans. The interest bill for shareholder debt
came to Pounds 84m in the last financial year to June, so BSkyB should save
as much as Pounds 70m in annual interest payments.
News Corporation, as the biggest investor with 50 per cent, is responsible
for the largest chunk of the shareholder debt. It should be repaid Pounds
500m of the Pounds 550m loans it advanced to BSkyB after the flotation.
Analysts suspect Mr Murdoch will channel the cash into Star, his Asian
television network.
Chargeurs, Granada and Pearson will also be repaid a large proportion of the
combined Pounds 250m they lent and be absolved of most of the Pounds 350m
debt they guaranteed. The three companies provided equal shares of the debt
and guarantees.
BSkyB will then decide how to deal with the remaining Pounds 200m of
shareholder debt and obligations. Its advisers say that the loans will
either remain intact or be transferred into external debt.
The reduction in the company's interest bill should have a dramatic effect
on its financial performance. Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, media analyst at
Morgan Stanley Securities, calculated that BSkyB could make pre-tax profits
of Pounds 210m in the year to June, against her previous forecast of Pounds
158m. She has pencilled in profits of Pounds 350m for the next financial
year.
Meanwhile the publicly-quoted BSkyB will have the flexibility to tap the
market for more capital if it requires additional funding to launch
ambitious ventures such as a pay-per-view digital satellite television
service. Funds may also be needed to meet tougher competition for
programming from the increasingly consolidated ITV companies and its
emerging rivals in cable television.
The flotation also offers an opportunity for the company to streamline the
complex ownership structure whereby its four shareholders have unusually
strong controls over various aspects of the company, notably investment.
As for the issue itself, observers seem confident that it will be a success.
'It's a great corporate story,' said Ms Winnington-Ingram. 'And this is the
perfect time to tell it.'

FT  08 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Argyll to withdraw from discount retailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argyll, the UK's third-largest grocery retailer, is selling the rest of its
Lo-Cost discount chain, ending its 13-year ownership of the trading name.
The group has agreed to sell 101 of its remaining Lo-Cost stores, together
with the trading name, and a freehold distribution depot at Queensferry,
North Wales, to Co-operative Retail Services, for up to Pounds 73m. It plans
to sell the remaining 50 stores and related assets 'in due course'.
The deal follows the sale of 123 Lo-Cost and 28 of Argyll's smaller Presto
supermarkets to a consortium of Spar companies for Pounds 19.7m in August.
CRS plans to continue operating the stores as discount outlets under the
Lo-Cost name, and is taking almost all of their 3,800 staff. About 60
redundancies will result from closure of Lo-Cost's head office.
As well as buying the Queensferry depot, CRS is leasing Lo-Cost's other two
distribution depots at Salford and Shrewsbury.
Mr Colin Smith, Argyll chief executive, said the decision to withdraw from
discount retailing was a result of the strategic review being conducted into
the group's business.
Lo-Cost made operating profits of only Pounds 6.3m on sales of Pounds 471m
in the year to April 2, and Argyll had decided to focus on its Safeway
superstores and Presto supermarkets.
The group was hindered in its efforts to make Lo-Cost a successful
discounter by the wide variation in store sizes in the chain.
CRS is paying Pounds 59m for the stores, plus up to Pounds 14m more, based
on the average sales of the stores in the eight weeks until completion on
November 12.
Argyll expects to make a total of between Pounds 86m and Pounds 100m from
the two sales agreed plus the sale of the remaining stores, compared with a
net asset value of about Pounds 93m.
Closure and other associated costs will be about Pounds 3m. The overall
effect on earnings per share is expected to be broadly neutral.
Argyll admitted the sale was not being made 'without a backward glance'.
Lo-Cost was originally the retail operation of Oriel Foods, acquired by
Argyll in 1981 from the RCA Corporation.
The original Argyll management team ran Oriel Foods at RCA between 1974 and
1977.

FT  08 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Facing the reality of price pressures - The
squeeze is on for the UK's specialist chemicals companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When it comes to setting prices, some of Britain's leading speciality
chemicals companies pay scant regard to the government's inflation target
range of 1 to 4 per cent.
The companies, which rely on bulk petrochemicals to manufacture products
ranging from latex and foam to paint, are under mounting pressure to pass on
sharp increases in raw materials prices, which for some commodities have
more than doubled.
Their freedom to charge more has been restricted, however, because many
industrial customers are reluctant to pay higher prices in a competitive low
 -inflation environment.
'Demand has been relatively slack, so many companies will have to absorb the
higher raw material prices through internal cost savings,' warns Mr Keith
Wey, senior economist at the Chemical Industries Association.
That prospect has prompted a series of cautious trading statements in recent
weeks from speciality chemicals companies, including British Vita, Hickson
International, Holliday Chemicals and, most recently, Yule Catto.
Reporting a 42 per cent increase in half-year profits last week, the
Harlow-based chemicals and building products group warned that rising raw
materials prices could hamper future growth.
Although it has reduced costs to offset the impact of price rises, Mr Alex
Walker, chief executive, said margins could be squeezed in the second half.
Many of these companies cut costs aggressively during the recession and now
have little room for manoeuvre, especially those relying on commodities such
as ethylene, styrene, orthoxylene and methanol.
European spot prices for ethylene, the building block for many chemical
products, have risen by 120 per cent from Dollars 250 (Pounds 158) per tonne
in April to Dollars 550 last month; methanol, by comparison, rose 125 per
cent from Dollars 187 per tonne to Dollars 422.
Contract prices have also risen steadily although they still remain below
the 1989 peak, when ethylene sold at Dollars 700 per tonne against Dollars
400 per tonne this month.
While warning that the increases would hit margins, City analysts said the
speciality chemicals companies had enjoyed substantial gains while commodity
prices languished at historic lows in the past two years.
'The bulk chemicals producers such as ICI are exacting revenge for the price
cuts they suffered during the recession,' says Mr Martin Evans at Hoare
Govett. 'It will take several months for the intermediates to push up
selling prices. If we had runaway inflation they could recoup costs, but
that's not happening.'
For their part, the bulk suppliers claim prices have increased because there
are insufficient stocks available to meet new orders coming through from the
speciality companies.
'Any price increases to our customers are being driven by supply and demand
rather than raw material costs, and are taking place after a period of
unsustainable low levels during the recession,' says Mr Peter Corners,
business manager at ICI Olefines.
Prices for ethylene, for example, rose sharply following shortages in the US
where supplies were hit after an explosion in August at Exxon Chemical's
Baton Rouge plant in Louisiana, where production was interrupted for several
weeks.
Stocks normally available to UK intermediates have also been diverted to
east Asia following the closure of some chemicals plants in Japan, where a
prolonged drought led to water restrictions for industrial users.
But warnings of widespread shortages are viewed with some scepticism at
British Vita, the foam and fibre group.
'I'm not sure how many shortages there really are. I think the bulk
suppliers are playing that card a bit too strongly,' said Mr Rod Sellers,
chief executive.
He blamed pricing pressures and flat demand among customers for sluggish
half year operating profits, adding that the group's main markets were
static or improving only slowly.
British Vita has reduced its workforce by 5 per cent to 12,800 and tried to
cut costs, but Mr Sellers warned: 'Either we have to pass on price increases
or we will have to make fundamental changes in product specifications.'
Raw material price increases have also hit those companies which have
enjoyed increased demand. Supplies bought at contract prices are proving
insufficient, and extra orders are set at much higher spot prices.
'In some cases we can pass it on, but it's proved difficult because stocks
were run down last year,' says Mr Jim Ratcliffe, managing director of
Inspec, the speciality chemicals company which came to the market earlier
this year.
City analysts are sympathetic, but remind the manufacturers that they've
never had it so good.
'It will be hard to pass on meaningful increases, but they've had a very
comfortable time during the past two years,' says Mr Philip Morrish of Smith
New Court.
The worst affected companies are now enduring a time lag before cost
increases can be recovered, and although the industry has been through
similar cycles in the past, this time the prospects are grimmer for passing
on higher prices.
'Last time this happened the economy was growing faster,' says Martin Evans
at Hoare Govett. 'But now it's a different story - the squeeze is on.'

Mr Jim McCarthy has been appointed chief executive of T&amp;S Stores, the
newsagent and convenience store retailer. Mr McCarthy was previously joint
managing director with Mr Stephen Boddice, 42, who retires from business
life on December 31.
Mr McCarthy joined the T&amp;S board as group retail director from Dillons
newsagents, where he had been managing director since 1985. T&amp;S acquired the
Dillons and Alfred Preedy chains of confectionery, tobacco and newspaper
stores from Next for Pounds 53.9m in 1989.
Mr Boddice leaves T&amp;S after 17 years at the Walsall-based company, which has
grown from owning three kiosks to more than 700 stores in less than 20
years.
Mr David Crellin has been appointed group financial director, after working
as operating financial director. He joined T&amp;S in 1990 after directorships
at Evode and Scotcade.

FT  08 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Henderson Highland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The net asset value per share of Henderson Highland Trust stood at 125.4p at
August 31, down from 138.2p at the February 28 year-end but up slightly on
its level of 125.3p at the interim stage last year.
Net revenue for the six months amounted to Pounds 742,000 (Pounds 810,000).
A second interim dividend of 1.4p making 2.8p for the half-year has already
been declared.
Earnings per share came out at 2.84p (3.1p) and the directors said they
expect earnings for the full year would more than cover the annual dividend
rate of 5.6p.

FT  08 OCT 94 / UK Company News: A Cohen recovers to Pounds 764,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Cohen, maker of non-ferrous metal ingots, reported a substantial recovery
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 36,000 to Pounds 764,000 for the first half
of 1994. Turnover, however, fell by Pounds 8m to Pounds 35.5m because of a
policy of concentrating on lower volume, higher margin business in some
sectors.
Earnings per share were 27p (8.96p losses), but owing to a decision to
rebuild cash resources there is again no interim dividend - the last payment
was a 3.4p final for 1992.
Cohen said its principal markets were now all recovering and that demand,
particularly aluminium, was strong. The directors were 'cautiously
optimistic' for the full year.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Good news is bad for shares: Why London stocks are less than
buoyant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the average investor in UK shares, the last couple of weeks have been
one long bungee jump.
The FT-SE 100 Index has been bouncing up and down, recording a rise or fall
of more than 25 points on six out of the last eight trading days. Over the
course of the year, the trend has been more down than up; the Footsie is now
about 15 per cent down from its peak in February.
By the standards of the past 30 years, it is still arguable whether this is
a fully-fledged bear market, or merely a correction within a longer bull
run. Since 1965, there have been nine occasions when the FT-SE Actuaries
All-Share index has fallen, peak to trough, by more than 20 per cent, with
the long drawn-out decline of 1972-74 being the worst example. This year's
fall has yet to reach such proportions. But there is a danger that it might.
What may puzzle the small investor is the background to the current
gyrations. The UK economy is looking remarkably healthy; growth is set to
top 3 per cent this year, underlying inflation is low at 2.3 per cent,
unemployment is falling and the trade deficit is narrowing. In such
conditions, investors might reason, share markets should be rejoicing, not
lamenting.
Furthermore, the most common explanation for the declines in world bond and
equity markets this year is the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest
rates to slow the US economy. But if the US is the problem, how come Wall
Street is just 4 or 5 per cent off its all-time high, when the Footsie is
around 15 per cent off its peak?
The answer to these riddles lies partly in events in 1993 and partly in what
markets fear for 1995 and beyond.
Last year was an annus mirabilis for financial markets. In the UK,
medium-term gilts returned around 23 per cent and equities 27 per cent.
Market buoyancy resulted from a fall in interest rates round the world that
persuaded investors to switch from cash into bonds and equities. US
investors, in particular, were putting money overseas, with many using money
borrowed at historically low interest rates.
The bubble burst in February 1994 when the Federal Reserve made its first
upward move in interest rates. Although the change was small - from 3 per
cent to 3.25 per cent - it caused a much larger shift in investor sentiment
worldwide.
If the Fed was tightening monetary policy, investors reasoned, maybe
inflation was going to be a problem in the US. Furthermore, signs of growing
economic recovery in Europe made investors worry about inflation and less
confident about further declines in European interest rates. The rise in
commodity prices added to the worldwide surge in inflation expectations.
Those US investors who were speculating with borrowed money quickly tried to
cash in their bond holdings to cut their losses. Bond prices fell sharply
and stock markets suffered from the knock-on effect.
The UK suffered more than most from the switch. According to Yamaichi
International (Europe), 10-year UK gilts yielded 0.47 of a percentage point
more than US Treasuries at the start of the year and 0.74 of a percentage
point more than German bunds. Those spreads have since widened to 1.11
percentage points and 1.27 percentage points respectively.
If inflation is set to return around the globe, investors fear that its
level will be higher in the UK, because of the country's past record.
'People have been deeply ingrained with the view that it is always right to
be pessimistic about the UK,' says Mr Bob Semple, head of economics and
strategy at NatWest Markets.
February's cut of a quarter of a percentage point in UK base rates, which
came just four days after the Fed increased US rates, may have reinforced
the impression that the UK was soft on inflation, and raised doubts about
the strength of the UK's monetary regime. 'It is clear that the Bank of
England had its arm twisted to agree to a rate cut in February,' says Mr
Semple.
Since that February cut in rates, the pace of UK economic growth has picked
up, prompting the chancellor to agree to a rise of half a percentage point
in base rates in September, to head off inflationary pressures.
But the markets have yet to be convinced that the UK authorities are in
control, and remain pessimistic about the outlook for base rates. Futures
markets indicate that traders expect base rates to reach around 6.7 per cent
by year end, and nearly 9 per cent by the end of 1995.
So although economic growth, by boosting corporate earnings, ought to be
good for the equity market, its benefits have been overshadowed by the rise
in inflationary expectations, which have led to higher bond yields.
For the international investor, the news has been even worse. Sterling's
decline this year means that, in US dollar terms, the UK market has
underperformed every major European stock market except France.
Is the poor performance of the UK equity market set to continue? This year's
declines have removed some of the signs that shares were overvalued. The
historic price-earnings ratio on the All-Share - the measure used by
analysts to compare share prices to corporate profits - has dropped from a
heady 25.8 in February to around 17.5 today.
The dividend yield on the All-Share is a fraction over 4 per cent, below its
long-term average, but well above the 2.8 per cent reached at the height of
the bull market in 1987.
Furthermore, dividends offer a positive real return (they are higher than
inflation) - a situation that has existed only rarely in the last 20 years.
The yield ratio, a measure that relates the income return from long-term
gilts to that from equities, is around 2.21, close to its average since
1976. According to Mr Ian Harnett, chief economist of Societe Generale
Strauss Turnbull Securities, this can give investors some comfort since the
last three severe market downturns have occurred when the yield ratio was
over 2.5.
However, for the UK market to recover, it needs to circumvent three
obstacles. The first is the danger that inflation may accelerate, and the
trade position may deteriorate, just as it has in so many previous UK
economic cycles. The result will be sharply higher base rates and bond
yields - more bad news for share prices.
The second danger is that the government had already acted too hastily in
raising interest rates, especially in view of the tax increases to come. The
consequence is that economic growth, and corporate earnings, will slow in
1995.
The final risk lies across the Atlantic. The UK stock market has fallen
farther than that of the US, but many feel it is Wall Street and not London
which is the anomaly. If further Fed tightening and a change of sentiment
among US private investors causes a sharp fall in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average this autumn, UK investors could be due for another bungee jump.

Sir, In his review of Opera North's new Il trovatore ('Outbreak of symbolism
in Leeds 'trovatore' ', October 4), Richard Fairman writes disparagingly of
the tenor's high notes in the famous cabaletta being 'high Bs rather than
Cs, if I am not mistaken'.
On the one hand your critic is admitting that he does not have perfect pitch
(a rare gift anyway), but on the other he is implying that he is clever
enough to tell that the cabaletta was sung a semitone lower than written.
Surely, if he felt it necessary to make this point, Fairman could have
swallowed his ignorance and actually asked someone at Opera North]

FT  08 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: A new millennium - and not a traffic
cone to be seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs A LISTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With regard to celebrating the millennium ('Wanted - wonder of the
age', October 1), I think the government should pledge to remove every
single traffic cone from every road in the kingdom by 4.30pm on December 31
1999.
In order to placate all those who believe that celebrations should only take
place in December 2000, I suggest that, during the intervening year, all the
cones gathered should be given to a number of sculptors, who can each create
a fitting memorial to the 'last' century. These sculptures should be placed
at various points around the country, to be seen from our motorways, rather
as Stonehenge is viewed from the A303.
This pledge, incidentally, should be put on the statute books so that any
other incoming government must abide by it too. Thus, future generations
will gain from finished roads, no more road works, and the disbanding (and
financial saving) of the cones hotline.

FT  08 OCT 94 / The ultimate privatisation: Who should own human genes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Labour party conference was not the only place where people were
arguing furiously this week about private versus public ownership. The
international meeting on human genes in Washington DC was equally divided by
debate over whether genetic information should be freely available in the
public domain, or the private property of the researchers who patent it
first.
Each side claims that its favoured system will accelerate the application of
genetic discoveries to human health, in the form of treatments and
diagnostic tests for diseases from cancer to mental illness.
Arguments over gene ownership have bedevilled biotechnology and medical
research for several years. They are now reaching a new intensity, as
scientists realise how much the private sector is coming to dominate the
race to discover the 100,000 genes which control human development and
susceptibility to disease.
The biomedical research leaders who launched the grandiose Human Genome
Project in the late 1980s as a Pounds 2bn international effort to decode all
DNA (the chemical store of genetic information) expected it to take about 15
years and to be funded largely by governments. In fact biotechnology
companies, in partnership with the established pharmaceutical industry, are
spending more on genetics research than the traditional public bodies such
as the US National Institutes of Health and the UK Medical Research Council
 -and, by taking scientific short cuts, they are producing results more
quickly.
However, the debate is not simply between academic and industrial
researchers. Within each group, opinions are divided on the merits of
patenting genes, as two of the world's largest drugs companies, Merck and
SmithKline Beecham, showed this week when they announced diametrically
opposed policies on the issue.
Merck said it would establish a comprehensive database of genetic
information to which everyone, including commercial competitors, will have
open access. The company will provide several million dollars for Washington
University in St Louis, one of the top US genetics labs, to create new data
for the so-called Merck Gene Index.
'This will facilitate progress in biomedical research by reducing
duplication of effort, speeding the identification of disease-related genes
and enhancing the probability of breakthrough drug discoveries,' says Dr
Edward Scolnick, Merck's head of research.
Although the company's announcement was couched in terms of
self-congratulatory altruism, some competitors saw it as more of a spoiling
move to make up for the fact that Merck had been slow to appreciate that
genetic discoveries could transform pharmaceutical research.
On the other hand SmithKline Beecham, until recently one of the sleepier
pharmaceutical giants, has moved astonishingly quickly to feed genetic
information into its mainstream research since linking up with Human Genome
Sciences, the leading biotech company specialising in gene discovery, in May
1993. SB is paying HGS Dollars 125m over 10 years for an equity stake and
exclusive access to its private database, which already contains partial or
complete DNA sequences of about one-third of all human genes.
The key to HGS's success is a short-cut called cDNA (complementary DNA)
sequencing. This fishes out from particular body tissues (eg the brain)
pieces of DNA corresponding to genes that are active there. It gives a
library of gene fragments written in the four letters of the genetic code -
C A T G - rather like an index of first lines in a poetry book. Most
sequences are distinctive enough for scientists to understand their meaning.
In Washington this week SB and HGS made clear that they had no intention of
allowing others unrestricted access to the database, which they believe
gives them a huge competitive advantage for future product development. At
the same time they revealed the terms under which academic researchers would
be allowed to use the database. The main condition is that HGS will have
first rights to exploit any patentable discovery they make.
'The conditions that govern access to these data should preserve the
incentive for the private sector to invest the funds necessary to bring new
drugs and diagnostic products to the market,' says Dr William Haseltine, HGS
chief executive. 'Unalloyed dumping of genetic information into the public
sector is not in the best interests of the public.'
Dr Michael Morgan of the London-based Wellcome Trust, the world's largest
medical research charity, brought together all interested parties in a
fringe meeting at this week's Washington conference, to try to work out a
consensus for future action.
'The HGS/SB proposal may well be acceptable to academia, though we shall
have to study the terms carefully,' Dr Morgan says. 'But they are not giving
access to the pharmaceutical industry, so there is enormous support from the
other drug companies for a public domain database.'
Dr Morgan says his meeting agreed that Merck's proposal should form the
basis of an international effort to identify as many individual genes as
possible and 'map' the position of each gene on one of the 23 chromosomes
that carry all human DNA. The mapping stage is essential for understanding
how the genes work.
Glaxo, the largest UK drug company, would be happy to join in too, says Dr
Barry Ross, research director, 'if this can be developed into a full
partnership between industry and academia, rather than something run by
Merck with the Merck name on it'.
Everyone involved in genetics research agrees that patent protection is
needed at some stage to provide the financial incentive for companies to
turn the science into products. The contentious question really is: at what
point in the R&amp;D process should patents take effect to end the sharing of
public information and stimulate product development?
SB, HGS and other biotechnology companies whose competitive advantage is in
creating genetic information want patents to take effect as early as
possible. Merck, Glaxo and other large drug companies believe that patents
should not operate 'until you have a gene-based product to protect', as Dr
Ross puts it.
Academics' views depend mostly on whether they are involved with biotech
companies seeking to exploit genetic information. Last month's decision by
the University of Utah and Myriad Genetics, a US biotech company, to patent
their discovery of a gene causing breast cancer provoked a hostile reaction
from researchers who said it would destroy future collaboration in the
search for cancer genes.
Overshadowing the debate is confusion about the way patent law applies to
genetic discoveries. Rulings by the US Patent Office and its European
counterparts have been contradictory and not yet tested in court. It will
not be known for many years what level of genetic information can be
protected. Will it be a fragment of a gene, the full human gene, or the gene
incorporated into a potential product?
Wherever the line is eventually drawn, it is already clear that the old
academic ideal of open scientific collaboration unmotivated by commercial
gain is as out of date as the Labour party's Clause 4.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Merger of accountancy bodies
inevitable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R N CHISMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'An institutional fracture in need of repair'
(Accountancy Column, October 6), on the rationalisation of the accounting
profession misses the point.
It would be obvious to a Martian that the six bickering representative
organisations ought to be merged into a single influential professional
body. However, the main obstacle to this is the widely held belief that the
members of the three chartered institutes will not vote for a merger - even
when watered down as in the proposals recommended by the working party,
chaired by David Bishop of KPMG Peat Marwick. And the reason they will not
vote to merge is the general perception that the title 'chartered
accountant' carries more status and earning power than the titles from the
other bodies. There is a desire for some to be seen as more equal than
others.
Faced with such intransigence it would be folly for the other bodies to
formulate plans for the improvement of the profession based upon the highly
improbable premise of a merger. The other bodies cannot address this
obstacle in the short term and the only practical approach is to plan round
it and to make alternative proposals such as those formulated by Anthea Rose
and the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants.
Common sense will eventually triumph - you are either a qualified accountant
or you are not - so merger is inevitable, whether by intervention or
consensus. But I am not sure I will see it in my professional lifetime.
While it remains impossible to achieve it at one step, the only option is to
embark on the first of a series of small steps - and on that basis I support
the proposal for a General Accounting Council.

   From Mr RICHARD UZUPRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was interested to read the latest proposals by the Stock Exchange to
inhibit insider dealing as reported by Robert Peston ('Tighter checks on
insider dealing proposed', October 5). I would like to make the following
two observations:
1) Suspension of dealings in shares after 'normal' price fluctuation
parameters have been exceeded would probably be too late, as the
professional insiders would have already dealt.
2) In the specific case of Portals it is doubtful that any stockbroker asked
by a client whether or not to sell the shares during the four-day period in
question would have failed to point out the bid speculation - the
shareholders who missed out would more than likely have been those using
execution-only, cut-price share dealing facilities. Investing is the same as
any other business - you only get what you pay for.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I imagine Stephen Butler (Letters, October 3) has little practical
experience of financial markets, judging by his faith in them over central
bankers. Even casual observation - as opposed to simple economic theory -
leads to the conclusion that most market participants can be wrong for some
of the time.
Eventually they realise their mistake and the market corrects - often
dramatically.
Who I wonder, on average, is the most 'trustworthy' when predicting
inflation? Large numbers of traders with little option but to follow the
prevailing 'market view', or central bankers appointed by politicians but
with reputations to develop? Difficult one, that.

Sir, We are all entitled to change our opinions, but your art critic,
William Packer, seems to have been persuaded to change his extraordinarily
quickly.
In his account of the Jerwood Painting Prize ('Damned by lack of
controversy', September 24) he attacks most vehemently the decision of the
judges to award the prize to Craigie Aitchison. Yet only two weeks earlier
he welcomed the purpose of the prize ('Excellence is the only criterion',
September 10), saying it was long overdue and 'what a relief it is to
confront a shortlist that is entirely acceptable. There is no token presence
and each artist has a chance of winning - well worth a punt'.
William Packer is also inaccurate in saying that one of the judges, Judith
Collins, is deeply distressed. The choice was accepted by all the judges
except Hilton Kramer, who has made his views known.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Parachutists on a mission: Richard Waters on moves to
improve profitability at US investment bank Kidder Peabody
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Who would buy an investment bank with a tattered reputation, bloat-ed costs,
an over-inflated balance sheet and a trunk-load of esoteric securities that
few people understand?
That is the question posed by other banks in response to General Electric's
thinly veiled desire to jettison Kidder Peabody, its troubled New York
investment bank.
On Thursday, the US industrial group took action to make Kidder a bit more
saleable. Six months after it was rocked by an alleged multi-million dollar
fraud (Kidder claimed its head government bond trader, Joseph Jett, had
created fictitious profits of Dollars 350m), the bank is undergoing an
overhaul. The result will be a smaller and - GE hopes - more profitable
bank.
The overhaul is being conducted by two GE executives parachuted into Kidder
in June to salvage its reputation: Mr Dennis Dammerman, GE's own chief
financial officer, and Mr Denis Nayden, a leading executive from GE Capital,
its financial services arm.
For Jack Welch, GE's chairman and chief executive, the changes at Kidder
come not a moment too soon. Having paid Dollars 600m for an initial 80 per
cent stake of Kidder in 1986 and pumped in another Dollars 800m in extra
capital since then, Welch's judgment has met with increasing criticism.
Kidder's new bosses are attacking the problems at the bank on four fronts.
First, they plan to shrink the bank's balance sheet. Under Mr Michael
Carpenter, the chairman ousted in June as a result of the Jett scandal,
Kidder had expanded its holdings of securities, pushing its total assets to
Dollars 106bn (Pounds 67bn) at the end of March. The bank had only about
Dollars 750m of capital to support these assets (the capital acts as a
cushion to absorb any losses).
While bond prices were rising around the world in the early 1990s, Kidder's
vast securities holdings generated profits. The bank could underwrite an
issue of new bonds, and hold the securities on its balance sheet for several
weeks or even months as it slowly sold them on to investors. The downturn in
bond prices since last October, though, put an end to the easy money days
for Kidder, as for the rest of Wall Street.
Piling assets on a small capital base produced high leverage, or gearing,
which increased market fears in recent months about the bank's financial
stability. Other big Wall Street firms have about Dollars 1bn of capital for
every Dollars 30bn-Dollars 35bn of assets they hold, says Mr Michael
Flanagan, a securities industry analyst at Lipper Analytical, the financial
research firm.
Since March, Kidder has shrunk its assets to Dollars 80bn. This week, it
said it aimed to bring the level down to Dollars 50bn-Dollars 60bn by the
end of this year.
More seems likely to follow. Mr Dammerman has said that he wants to bring
Kidder's balance sheet leverage into line with other Wall Street houses. To
achieve this means shedding assets unless he can persuade GE to pump in more
capital (which is unlikely, as GE has already injected Dollars 200m this
year).
The new Kidder bosses' second line of attack is to transfer Dollars 6.7bn of
esoteric securities, known as Collateralised Mortgage Obligations (CMOs), to
an affiliate of GE Capital. Mortgage-backed bonds, and the derivative-type
CMOs that can be created from them, have been the source of a large part of
Kidder's profits in recent years. However, the rise in US interest rates
this year - and the corresponding fall in bond prices - has hit the CMO
business particularly hard: buyers for the highly-structured securities have
vanished, making many of them hard to sell or to value.
Kidder has already sold off about Dollars 10bn of CMOs since March.
Shuffling the rest to GE Capital should remove a big question mark over the
bank and relieve pressure on its balance sheet.
The third move by Dammerman and Nayden is to take an axe to Kidder's costs
in an attempt to bring it back into profit - the bank is thought to have
lost Dollars 85m in the three months to the end of September. Among other
things, the disappearance of Dollars 350m of profits after the Jett fiasco
revealed that Kidder's real profits were lower during Wall Street's good
years than had appeared at the time.
The immediate target is to shed 10 per cent of Kidder's 5,500 staff and
reduce costs by Dollars 100m a year. The bank has said it will narrow the
scope of its investment banking activities to a handful of industries. It is
also expected to retreat from a number of business areas, such as some parts
of its derivatives trading and foreign exchange activities.
Fourth, the new management has indicated that it could sell those parts of
Kidder for which buyers can easily be found. The bank's 1,250-strong force
of retail brokers, for instance, is considered an attractive catch by
several rival broking houses. With average annual commissions said by the
bank to be Dollars 425,000, Kidder's brokers are more productive than those
at houses such as PaineWebber, which is contemplating an acquisition.
Kidder's fund management business is also considered a candidate for early
disposal.
Dammerman, meanwhile, has remained vague about whether what remains of
Kidder would eventually be sold. Announcing the staff cuts this week, GE's
chief financial officer acknowledged that outsiders would interpret such
measures as an attempt to spruce up the bank for sale. That was not the
immediate purpose, he added: rather, it was to put the bank into order.
What is undoubtedly true is that it will be a lot easier to sell what
remains of Kidder once it has been slimmed down and refocused. GE will soon
have the option of getting out of its disastrous excursion into Wall Street.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Middle England's malaise: The despondency undermining Tory
support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mike Bawden, a long-serving conservative councillor in Swindon, is not a
melodramatic man. But as he surveys middle England this autumn, his verdict
is that something strange is afoot.
'The government has a big problem,' he admits. 'All the yardsticks by which
we used to measure the economy have changed, and people just don't feel
wealthy or good any more.'
The failure of the feelgood factor to return with economic growth is
troubling the Conservative party as it assembles for its conference next
week. An internal inquiry has been launched into the government's low
popularity, led by Mr John Maples, one of the party's deputy chairmen. He
insists the despondency will lessen in time.
But two years into the recovery, the message from Swindon is not simply that
the feelgood factor is elusive but that there is little likelihood of a
rapid change in mood.
On paper, Swindon is a manufacturing success story. In the late 1980s, the
local economy grew fast as companies such as Honda, the Japanese car maker,
opened factories locally. Growth faltered with the recession in the early
1990s, but its economy is expanding again.
Unemployment, which rose from 4 per cent in the late 1980s to 9 per cent in
1992, has fallen back to 6 per cent. The town's retailers detect modest
sales growth. And 10,000 homes are being built in what will be Europe's
largest private sector housing development.
But, says Mr Geoff Teather, editor of the Swindon Evening Advertiser,
'nobody is really thanking the government'.
Tax increases such as the imposition of Value Added Tax on domestic power
have been introduced gradually, adding to consumer uncertainty. But, says Mr
Bawden, the housing market is the real culprit for Middle England's malaise.
Flat house prices have not only left the town with myriad tales of negative
equity but have also forced many middle class residents to re-evaluate
financial strategies.
For example, David, a 36-year-old project planner, bought a house five years
ago for Pounds 140,000. He tried, and failed, to sell it for about Pounds
120,000 last year. 'In the 1980s, people like me thought if we had spare
cash we had to get on the housing ladder and keep borrowing and moving up.
But now that's ended. We have had to look at our salary again and think a
lot harder about saving.'
Few people expect an early end to this malaise. Mr Russell Cleverley, of
developers Hannick, says that although the market picked up at the start of
the year, it has stalled again. He blames the end of fixed rate mortgages, a
crucial marketing tool in a time of low economic confidence. 'I was thinking
of buying a place for my children, but I won't now they have withdrawn the
fixed rate.'
There is no shortage of jobs locally. Indeed Mr Andy Cable, of the Response
Management mail order group, says he has recruitment problems as he prepares
for Christmas demand. But the part-time, flexible jobs he is offering have
only limited appeal. 'You can get temporary jobs, but there is really not
much proper stuff around,' says Miss Ann Whitfield, who recently found a job
as a receptionist.
Few people in Swindon are yet predicting that the three Conservative MPs in
the area will be ousted at the next election. But as Mr Teather of the
Swindon Evening Advertiser observes: 'Labour is re-emerging just as these
economic changes are happening. Mr Tony Blair must be hoping that people in
Swindon could turn out to be his children of tomorrow.'

FT  08 OCT 94 / An instinct for the centre: Tony Blair has ensured that John
Major cannot win the next general election by default
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You could sense from as far away as Blackpool the ministerial hand-wringing
in Whitehall. Mr Tony Blair achieved something rare this week. For the first
time since 1979, a Labour leader set the terms for the Tory conference.
As Mr John Major contemplates his week in Bournemouth, he knows his
performance will be judged against the powerful debut of his Labour
opponent. Mr Blair reached out beyond his party's activists to the
disaffected Tory voters who will decide the next general election. Mr Major
must begin to explain why they should return to the Conservative fold.
This should not be a crisis conference for the prime minister. Unusually
since the sterling debacle on Black Wednesday, there is no immediate threat
to his leadership. The economic recovery is real and well-balanced. For the
moment, he has papered over the cracks in his party over Europe.
So, fingers crossed, next week will be, as was always planned, a sedate
affair: a mid-term stock-taking exercise with no grand pronouncements, no
great visions. Facing an audience still badly bruised by recession and
angered by rising crime rates, the message has gone out to ministers to
avoid any hint of triumphalism.
After his performance in Blackpool, there will be no real attempt to
demolish Mr Blair. The voters are fed up with the politics of knocking; more
seriously, ministers have yet to discover a credible line of attack on the
Labour leader.
The message Mr Major wants to repaint on his government's peeling shop front
is one of quiet, gritty competence. Don't worry, it says to those
disillusioned Conservatives, we will arrive before the election.
The prime minister's image-makers are taking a similar tack in rebuilding
his reputation with the voters. No, he is not a towering political figure in
the mould of his predecessor. But look at how he gets things done.
He has taken hard decisions on the economy; and they are paying off with low
inflation and steady growth. He has taken risks in Northern Ireland; and
there is the best hope of peace for 25 years. He has stood up for Britain
against the hated bureaucrats of Brussels; and he will do again at the 1996
intergovernmental conference.
The safety-first approach is understandable. Conservative Central Office has
spent the past month quizzing disaffected supporters. The voters are
unconvinced by the reality of economic recovery. This is an upturn in which
their disposable income is falling, not rising. So are house prices. And
there are more tax increases to come.
The electorate shares traditional Tory values on law and order and
education. But it judges the government is not delivering safety on the
streets or high standards and discipline in the classroom.
Nor are the voters keen on the idea that the new breed of highly-paid
bureaucrats in the national health service spend more time furnishing their
executive suites than improving patient care. It is no accident that Mr
Michael Howard, the home secretary, and Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health
secretary, are among the nation's least popular politicians.
All of this is perfectly clear to anyone who strays occasionally into the
world of real people. But politicians only believe the obvious after they
have paid huge sums to discover it from the opinion pollsters.
Mr Major's theme - assuming that he has not ripped up his speech entirely in
the wake of Mr Blair's appearance in Blackpool - will be security.
The voters of middle England are troubled by a changing, harsh and
competitive world. The middle-class life plan, the bedrock of Tory support
in southern England, is threatened by the pace of technological change, by a
cash-strapped welfare state and, above all, by an insecure employment
market.
The government's answer is the promise of a steady, sustainable recovery
instead of a return to boom and bust; a deregulated economy that allows
Britain to keep up with world competition; and, when Mr Kenneth Clarke
judges they can be afforded, all-important tax cuts.
It is an approach that most in the cabinet have signed up for. Mr Clarke
still hankers for another burst of radicalism, but the consolidators have
the ear of No 10 Downing Street. The one controversial announcement
scheduled for next week - privatisation of the Royal Mail - has now been
delayed until the Tory faithful return home.
There is nothing much now that the Conservatives can do to rewrite the
script for Bournemouth, though plenty of ministers will spend the weekend
sharpening up their speeches to dispel any hint of complacency. But a
strategy tailored to the pressures of the party conference will not be
enough to counter the threat from Mr Blair. The opposition now has a leader
with the authority and the intellect to take on the Con-servatives in the
battle of ideas.
Sure, his party still has the capacity to shoot itself in the foot (though
in the 1980s it tended to aim the gun at its head). Conference defeats this
week on Clause IV public ownership and defence will give ministers
much-needed ammunition in Bournemouth.
But Mr Blair knows where he is going: into the political centre ground.
Labour is to represent the aspirant classes. For all the talk of modernism,
what he is doing is reconnecting it to its traditional roots as the party of
opportunity. The voters who elected Mr Clement Attlee in 1945 and Mr Harold
Wilson in 1964 were won over not by dewy-eyed socialism but by the promise
of a brighter future.
The prime minister's view that the anxieties of middle England will be the
most potent force at the next general election is shared by the Labour
leader. The difference is that Mr Blair judges that the electorate's
instincts have shifted back towards the centre. The individualism of the
1980s has become the insecurity of the 1990s.
It was no accident that in Tuesday's speech Mr Major was not mentioned by
name; nor for that matter were Mr Clarke or Mr Douglas Hurd. Mr Blair's
targets were the embattled Mr Howard and Mr Michael Portillo, the
standard-bearer of the Tory right. Forget Labour's leftwing past, the Tories
are the extremists now, he was saying.
There are flaws. It was easy to detect in the speech the tensions between
his embrace for the market and the romanticism of Old Labour; easier still
in the speeches of shadow cabinet colleagues. He will face serious internal
battles over tax before the next general election.
To watch Mr Blair up close is to understand how determined he is that New
Labour will win. He has already in his back pocket a draft of the new
statement of aims and values that will replace Clause IV. He is thinking
ahead in a way that Mr Neil Kinnock was never allowed to and Mr John Smith
never felt inclined to.
Mr Major is not lost. The government might yet recreate itself as the
guardian of security in a changing world. Put another dash for integration
by Britain's European partners alongside Labour's plans for devolution in
Scotland and Wales and you can see the possibility of a campaign built
around defence of the (British) Union.
But one thing is clear: 1992 was the last election the Conservatives will
win by default.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Prudence redefined
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The uncomfortable condition known to economists as structural adjustment is,
it seems, to be visited on the hapless man from the Pru. From next January,
the giant of the British life assurance business will cease to sell new
'industrial branch' policies - the technical description for door-to-door
home sales of life assurance. Since industrial life policies are an
expensive and largely anachronistic form of saving in the world of fax,
phone and direct debit, the change is overdue. But it is a piece or social
history for all that. The step also raises the question of why savings
habits have responded so slowly to a changing economic environment.
Industrial life assurance has always been open to the criticism that the man
from the Pru and his ilk took a disproportionate bite out of the
individual's savings before any money was actually invested. In the days of
Victorian paternalism, this financial penalty arising from the need to
remunerate the sales force was perceived as an antidote to working class
fecklessness. Money ill-spent on a poor form of insurance was at least
better spent than money in the pub. The man from the Pru was, in effect,
selling the financial equivalent of cocoa.
The fact that this technically inefficient - and latterly tax inefficient -
practice survived into the prosperous 1990s must owe a great deal to the
lack of transparency in the life assurance business itself. In the absence
of adequate disclosure about the costs of a given policy - a deficiency now
being addressed under the new financial services regime - less sophisticated
savers had no reason to believe that they were substantially worse off than
if they had invested elsewhere. Inflation, meantime, made the returns sound
generous in relation to the money outlays over a lifetime of saving. In
fairness to the insurers, it should also be said that the high level of
investment returns in the postwar period helped mitigate the pain arising
from the insurance companies' costs.
Financial penalties
Industrial branch business is now so small that if the whole of the
insurance industry were to abandon it tomorrow, it would make little
difference to the aggregate savings behaviour of the nation. But that does
not mean that the less well off in the late 20th century are not subject to
comparable financial penalties. As a recent paper on the distribution of
wealth from the Institute for Fiscal Studies confirmed, less well-off
households have invested disproportionately in interest-bearing accounts
with banks and building societies. Since these are the most heavily-taxed
forms of wealth, it is the state rather than the insurance companies that
now fills the role of predator.
This is just one indication of how strangely the taxation of savings fits
with wider priorities. Another is the way that the savings of the better off
have been biased by fiscal incentives towards illiquid, longer-term forms of
investment such as home ownership and pensions. Despite growing labour
market insecurity and disinflation in the housing market, the retreat from
liquidity in savings remains pronounced.
Savings behaviour
Do such apparent imbalances matter? Perhaps not as much as they used to, in
a macro-economic context, since surpluses and shortfalls of savings can now
be readily made good in a world of global capital flows. Yet governments
inevitably worry about the impact on their finances of underprovision by
individuals for retirement and misfortune. And there are political arguments
in favour of increasing people's stake in the productive assets of the
economy. For private individuals, the balance between the precautionary
motive for saving and the need to smooth out income to meet different
consumption requirements over the course of a lifetime clearly does matter
considerably. The case for tax neutrality between spending today and
spending tomorrow is thus very powerful.
Yet economic shocks are quite as important as fiscal sticks and carrots in
changing savings behaviour. It was the great inflation of the post-war
period that drove the British into one of the highest levels of home
ownership in the developed world and into taking on what is now the highest
level of mortgage debt to housing equity in living memory. And while fiscal
incentives contributed greatly to the growth of the life assurance industry,
it is the regulatory shock of disclosure that now seems likely to put an end
to the industrial life assurance business, while causing an important if
less dramatic upheaval in the forms of other of savings on which insurers
rely for their revenues.
The Prudential salesmen will not, admittedly, hang up their hats quite yet.
There is an existing portfolio of policyholders to be serviced. And there
are other jobs for these salesmen to do within the Pru itself. To that
extent, the blow of structural adjustment is cushioned. But what of pride?
As of yesterday the man from the Pru has been reduced to the status of an
inefficient delivery system. That's the 20th century for you.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Man in the News: Milan's smooth Machiavelli - Francesco
Saverio Borrelli
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle between Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate turned
prime minister, and the Milan judiciary has reached a point of no return.
Both sides are on a collision course.
The script could not have been dreamt up better in Hollywood: a prime
minister whose business empire is under investigation for corrupt practices
seeks to incriminate the very judicial authorities who are investigating
him.
The Rubicon was crossed this week when Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, the
Milan public prosecutor and the figure behind the anti-corruption
investigations of the past two and half years, decided to discard his normal
caution. In an explosive newspaper interview on Wednesday, he warned Mr
Berlusconi that the investigative net was tightening around him and his
Fininvest empire.
If this was not enough, he insinuated that Mr Alfredo Biondi, minister of
justice, had behaved unprofessionally while defending a client in the
collapse of the late Mr Roberto Calvi's Banco Ambrosiano.
In response, the five month-old rightwing coalition government endorsed a
tough response, albeit with private reservations among some ministers. A
formal complaint was lodged on Thursday with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro,
asking him as head of the higher magistrates' council, the Italian
judiciary's governing body, to examine the case for disciplinary proceedings
and prosecution against Mr Borrelli.
Mr Borrelli coolly joked about the prospect of prison: 'I'm ready with my
toothbrush and pyjamas.' The 64-year-old public prosecutor could face a
minimum jail sentence of 10 years for undermining constitutional authority.
But he clearly intends to hang on to the post he has held since 1987. 'I
don't even give it (resignation) a thought] Why should I leave the
magistrature?' he asked. He has even postponed plans to apply for a
promotion to head the appeal court in Florence, where this Neapolitan-born
member of the judiciary has spent much of his career.
Mr Borrelli has played a backstage role throughout the two and half years
that Milan magistrates have made the headlines with their anti-corruption
investigations. However, he is credited as the strategist behind the
investigations - known as 'Tagentopoli' (bribe cities) - that have unearthed
a pervasive system of bribes and illicit funding involving the nation's
leading businessmen and politicians.
His discreet presence contrasts with that of public idol Mr Antonio Di
Pietro, the investigative magistrate in Milan who in February 1992 broke the
first 'Tagentopoli' corruption scandal. Mr Di Pietro is blunt-speaking,
flaunts his peasant origins and cares little about his clothes. Mr Borrelli
is soft-spoken with fluent sophisticated language. Sartorially, his spare,
stooping frame is always immaculately clad. While Mr Di Pietro is a computer
buff and likes the occasional shooting foray with friends, for Mr Borrelli
it is classical music, philosophy and horse-riding.
However, the partnership between this smooth intellectual with the grasp of
Machiavelli and the industrious policeman with his gift for computer
technology has been central to the Milan magistrature's success in exposing
the accumulated vices of Italy's postwar political system.
Mr Borrelli has been content to let his junior absorb the limelight,
realising the magistrate had the kind of honest aura that could catch the
public imagination. Thus it was Mr Di Pietro who, in the name of the Milan
magistrates, went on television to announce their collective resignation in
July in protest at plans by the Berlusconi government to introduce
legislation to curb the judiciary's power of preventive detention. The
government retreated.
Again, it was Mr Di Pietro who was delegated to attend the annual gathering
of top businessmen at Cernobbio in early September at which he suggested the
outlines of legislation to come to terms with the problems created by the
corruption scandals.
But it was Mr Borrelli - in consultation with jurists and academics - who
orchestrated the legislation to deal with the huge backlog of corruption
cases and the prospect of indefinite corruption investigations. The aim was
to encourage those who had paid bribes to come forward with generous
plea-bargaining opportunities, and corresponding penalties for those who
failed to confess within a specified time.
The move was squashed because the politicians objected to the Milan
magistrature trying to usurp the lawmaking role of parliament. In
retrospect, it was the refusal of the politicians to take up this olive
branch that has accelerated the current conflict.
Mr Borrelli and his fellow magistrates knew their continued inquiries would
affect many institutions - including the Guardia di Finanza, the financial
police. They also knew the government could be damaged by the investigations
into Fininvest, which risked leading to Mr Berlusconi and at least one other
minister.
As the pace of investigation has quickened after the summer break, Mr
Berlusconi and his ministers have sought to challenge the behaviour of the
judiciary. It is this that led to Mr Borrelli's now famous interview on
Wednesday.
Three possible reasons have been advanced by political analysts for his
decision to go public with his warning to Mr Berlusconi. The first is that
it was the angry reaction of the Milan magistrature against a prime minister
whose government has failed to find a mutually satisfactory
politico-judicial solution to end 'Tagentopoli'.
The second is that it was a move to unseat Mr Berlusconi and break up his
Forza Italia movement to favour the ascendancy of the neo-fascist
MSI/National Alliance, which has been courting Mr Borrelli and Mr Di Pietro.
But it is the third that seems the most plausible: it was a desperate
attempt to head off government moves to stifle their inquiries. For Mr
Berlusconi is now threatened with being ousted from office by those who
opened the way for him to become prime minister in the first place by
discrediting the old political parties.

FT  08 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Commons tactics to be
sharpened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour leadership left the Blackpool conference yesterday planning a
radical overhaul of the party's parliamentary activities to sustain the
momentum of Mr Tony Blair's modernisation drive.
Mr Blair, who believes that the conference has changed the nature of the
Labour party, has told friends that he will refuse to 'follow the government
agenda' when MPs return to Westminster this month after the summer break.
He believes Mr John Major's government can be unsettled by more imaginative
use of Labour's parliamentary rights, and better attendance by Labour MPs.
The campaign will start with a shake-up in the frontbench team, including
the shadow cabinet, to give talented younger MPs more opportunity to shine.
But the focus will be on Mr Blair's performance at prime minister's question
time, the twice-weekly ritual intended to allow MPs to hold Mr Major to
account.
Mr Blair believes he can rattle Mr Major by avoiding the formulaic approach
of most recent opposition leaders in favour of a more unpredictable
strategy.
Allies say he intends to illuminate Labour's political approach rather than
merely seek to exploit government embarrassment on topical issues.
Mr Blair may also decide to ask a single question occasionally, rather than
the often repetitive ration of three to which custom entitles him.
The change of parliamentary tactics is part of a series of measures intended
to put fresh life into Labour's image, which party strategists believe has
put off voters.
The revised approach was signalled as the conference drew to a close and Mr
John Prescott, the deputy leader, promised that the leadership would 'put a
smile on the face of our politics'.
As delegates prepared for the ritual singing of The Red Flag - assisted this
year by printed songsheets to avoid embarrassing stumbling over the words -
Mr Prescott called for an end to 'dreary meetings' attended by half a dozen
members.
Launching a recruitment drive intended to raise membership from 290,000 to
500,000 in two years he told delegates: 'There is more to Labour than
composites and committees.'
In a witty speech largely delivered from notes - unlike his barnstorming end
of conference speech on one-member-one-vote last year - he told delegates to
'stop speaking the language of the past and start practising the politics of
the future'.
Mr Prescott warned against complacency, but said the Conservatives were
'running scared' of a Labour party which had learned its lessons and was
again hungry for power.
'Tony Blair is leading a party which is reaching out to people and inspiring
them with a new politics,' he said.

FT  08 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Tougher line on media urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour leadership came under pressure from delegates to make a firmer
commitment to break up media monopolies and introduce regulation
guaranteeing the freedom of a pluralistic press.
Ms Mo Mowlam, shadow heritage secretary, said while cross-media ownership
was a fact of life, a future Labour government would 'regulate both
nationally and regionally to prevent media monopolies and protect the future
of public service broadcasting'.
A succession of speakers in the debate urged the leadership to go further
and draw up a 'clearer policy on media ownership'.
Ms Maggie Lee, from North Norfolk, said: 'If democracy means anything to
Labour it must mean an informed democracy. We need to spell out where the
party stands on this issue. We need proper newspaper regulation in an
attempt to break up the monopolies.'
The concentration of media ownership in Italy was cited by some delegates as
an example of what could happen in the UK if the present situation was left
unchanged. There were also calls to prevent 'media barons' such as Mr Rupert
Murdoch using profits from television interests to help cut the price of
newspapers 'to put others out of business'.
Bectu, the broadcasting union, said there was a need to preserve and promote
European public-service broadcasting in the face of competition from
weakly-regulated private-sector satellite television channels.
Ms Mowlam said the parliamentary Labour party would continue to campaign
against moves to further deregulate the media industry.
Delegates overwhelmingly backed a call to reconfirm the party's commitment
to public-service broadcasting and to prevent any future moves to deregulate
the industry.

FT  08 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Modernisers put jazz before
the Red Flag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few believed a Labour party conference would ever end like this.
Delegates stared in disbelief as a team of colourfully clad musicians burst
through a side entrance of the Winter Gardens, sauntered up to the platform
and proceeded to pump out New Orleans jazz.
Before they prepared to sing the Red Flag, Mr Tony Blair's party clapped
along to the Dixieland numbers. And to cap it all, Mr John Prescott, the
deputy leader, executed a neat jive with his wife on the conference
platform, receiving some of the loudest applause of the week.
As a historic conference drew to a close many delegates were delighted to
see Mr Blair's 'New Labour' party openly enjoying itself, matching the Tory
reputation for joie de vivre, looking to viewers at home like a
member-friendly party.
But for many leftwingers the images at this conference - the greenish
backdrop, the questioning of Labour's basic beliefs, the leader's
smart-suited aides clutching portable telephones - have left a sense of
unease.
With Dixieland music still ringing in his ears, Mr Leigh Richman, a 26-year
old delegate from Peckham, asked a question that has been on many lips this
week: 'Where on earth is the Labour party going?'
As they hurried to leave Blackpool yesterday it was the so-called
'modernisers' - the men and women who back Mr Blair's campaign to unhinge
Clause 4 and the commitment to common ownership - who had the clearest
answer.
Yes, the delegates' decision to reassert the cherished commitment to
nationalisation had been a setback for Mr Blair. The conference had defied
his call for a revision of the constitution and had brought his
post-election honeymoon to a close.
But this did not reduce their delight that Mr Blair was now taking on the
dinosaurs of the left.
Mr Mike Gapes, MP for Ilford North, said: 'I left last year's conference
with pessimism. I felt then that we weren't progressing anywhere. Now I
believe we are moving forward and changing the party for the better.'
Mrs Anne Inelgrove from Bracknell concurred. The conference decision to back
Clause 4 could be ignored. 'Without that row, people would have said the
conference was stage-managed,' she said. 'But the truth is that most of the
party is now reconciled to change.'
Above all, Mr Blair's supporters relished the quality of his keynote speech.
One delegate said: 'When Neil Kinnock addressed conference, you could often
fall asleep, wake up again and find he was on the same theme. This week we
got John F. Kennedy.'
For the activists on the left of the party it was very different. As they
prepared to go home the anger over Clause 4 had not been allayed.
Mr John MacIntyre, president of the MSF technical union, said: 'Tony Blair
made a tactical mistake by raising the issue. There was simply no need for
him to make that reference in the speech.'
Indeed, criticism was not hard to find. 'A disastrous week,' was the verdict
of Mr Bill Stevens from Plymouth and Sutton. Mr Tom Farnhill, a 20-year-old
delegate from East Devon, said: 'He couldn't have chosen a worse time to
raise this issue.' Another delegate said: 'In the next few months this could
seriously split the party.'
As he sets about revising the constitution Mr Blair knows that he has the
upper hand because the hard left of the party is losing ground. One leftwing
MP said there were many like himself who believed that their best hope now
was to take up the challenge Mr Blair had set them, redefining 'common
ownership' in a modern context.
He said: 'Our slogan has to be: 'New Britain, New Labour, New Left'.' Like
some delegates, he believed Mr Peter Hain, the MP for Neath, could play a
prominent part in developing the theme.
But even some of the leader's closest supporters expressed concern that
change was being driven too fast.
One rightwing MP privately admitted that Mr Peter Mandelson, the party's
former campaign director and a close aide to Mr Blair, had abused the unions
too much at the conference and could sow divisions.
As they left Blackpool many delegates believed that next year's conference
would bring this week's divisions - over Clause 4, the minimum wage and full
employment - to a head. But they also knew that Mr Blair and Labour have set
a formidable challenge.

FT  08 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Blair's control of executive
is reaffirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair's authority over the party was underlined when the conference
decisively rejected an attempt to reassert its own dominance over the
national executive.
The growing isolation of his critics was emphasised when a card vote
resulted in a resolution reaffirming the conference's 'unique position'
being defeated by 72.7 per cent to 27.3 per cent.
In the most controversial debate of the final session constituency activists
loudly cheered complaints by some delegates that the views of the conference
on the retention of Clause 4 in the party's constitution were being ignored.
Ms Christine Bowden, from Hove, protested that a motion passed by the
conference on Monday had been 'overturned' by Mr Blair when he called for a
review of the constitution in his speech the following day.
She said: 'Conference is our voice - listen to it Tony Blair. We don't come
here to bask in reflected glory.'
Ms Bowden deplored the 'setback for Blair' headlines earlier in the week
when the conference narrowly voted in favour of retaining Clause 4. 'Company
directors don't describe shareholders' decisions a 'setback','she said.
To further applause, Ms Bowden said that it was the constituency activists
who did the 'door stepping' and lived in the same world as the electorate
with which the party had lost touch in recent years.
Ms Agnes Davies from Cumnock, Carrick and Doon Valley said: 'I have no
intention of coming to a conference when the decisions about what is going
to happen have already been made.'
In a clear response to the anxieties of some delegates, Mr Larry Whitty, in
his final speech as the party's general secretary, urged the leadership to
remember 'you have to take the people with you'.
He highlighted the importance of the party's links with the trade unions.

FT  08 OCT 94 / 'Everyone is expecting less in bonus this year'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pay and job cuts loom in the City after a week in which one US investment
bank decimated staff and two UK houses issued profit warnings.
SG Warburg and Hambros said they were reviewing labour costs after warning
that bond markets would depress first-half profits. Warburg is under
particular pressure to economise - staff costs rose 40 per cent last year to
give the average employee Pounds 105,000 a year, the highest of any UK
house.
Bonuses, which can make half of an employee's compensation in a good year,
are heading down. A fixed-income securities trader with five years
experience could typically have made Pounds 100,000 last year, half in
salary and half in bonus. A City headhunter said: 'Everyone is expecting
considerably less in bonus this year.'
Cuts will not be across-the-board. The manager of one US investment bank's
London derivatives operation said: 'Good people will get higher bonuses.
There will be more disparity.'
One crude forecast puts bonuses at US investment banks in London down
between 30 per cent and 50 per cent from last year's lucrative year. The
guaranteed bonus, a feature of recruitment negotiations in 1993, is now
rare.
Lowering pay may not reduce overheads enough and redundancies are on the
agenda. Both Warburg and Hambros have denied any intention of immediate job
cuts. Sir Chips Keswick, deputy chairman of Hambros, said: 'I am certainly
not going to rush off and fire people at the wrong end of the cycle.'
Salomon Brothers of the US, which has suffered the heaviest reported losses
in securities markets, has resisted redundancies. But US investment banks
such as Kidder Peabody, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and CS First Boston
have announced redundancies.
Goldman Sachs will not comment officially but insiders at the firm, until
recently one of the most aggressive recruiters, speak of impending
dismissals. An executive with a rival firm said:, 'Goldman would hire three
people with the view that they would keep one, possibly hold on to another
and sack the third.'
The shake-out at US investment banks bodes ill for employment in the City.
Mr Patrick Alexander, partner at Korn Ferry, the executive search company,
said: 'It is like night following day that if people are being cut in New
York there will be people eventually cut in London.'
Already CS First Boston has shed 10 employees in London, as well as 70 in
New York. Lehman Brothers is proud of limiting redundancies at its
1,650-strong London office to 'single figures'. Several City firms said
there had been a burst of CVs arriving from nervous Goldman Sachs employees.
Banks portray redundancies as a reflection of the performance of the
employee, rather than the fortunes of the bank. Most investment banks rate
their employees and a decimation would involve sacking the weakest 10 per
cent. A senior British investment banker said: 'There are ways of doing it
by aggressive quality control.'
While employment in trading and sales of bonds is under pressure, other
areas of investment banking such as derivatives and advice on mergers and
acquisitions are healthier. A hopeful trader at a Japanese bank said: 'They
are still hiring people in derivatives.'
US investment bankers set great store on training to enable staff to switch
from one speciality to another as different markets rise and fall. But some
feel there are limits to such flexibility. One derivatives salesman said
brutally: 'People in derivatives are clever. People in fixed-income are
generally not.'
This year's tough conditions may, as in the late 1980s, push some people not
just from their current job, but out of the industry entirely. The head of
one US firm's UK operations said: 'It is painful but it is just something
that happens to our industry every two or three years.'

FT  08 OCT 94 / Rover counts up the benefits of surging productivity: David
Goodhart assesses the pay deal which may set a motor industry benchmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since 1992 when Rover Group agreed its 'new deal' - giving workers job
security and single status in return for much greater flexibility - it has
been hailed as a model for Britain's new co-operative industrial relations.
Following yesterday's generous two-year deal - giving up to a 10.7 per cent
pay rise over two years - it may also become known as the benchmark for
motor industry pay bargainers, at least for trade union negotiators.
That role used to be played by Ford - most famously with its 13.4 per cent
rise at the end of 1990. But Rover, with its surging output and exports, is
now challenging hard.
Part of the pay rise is a direct consequence of the 1992 deal. The
introduction of single status - the ending of all status distinctions
between blue and white-collar staff - was started only in 1992. This pay
deal takes it a lot further.
Instead of 11 grades - six for white-collar staff and five for manual
workers - there will be just three for all staff. The A grade will cover
lower skilled manual and clerical workers, with average basic pay of Pounds
284.50 per week. The B grade will cover skilled craftsmen and more qualified
white-collar staff such as accounts clerks, with average basic pay of Pounds
311.85. The C grade covers team leaders and design engineers, with an
average salary of Pounds 17,957.
Different groups receive different sums for agreeing to these changes and
some receive nothing at all. But the extra payments for this regrading
accounts for the different interpretations of the deal. The company stresses
that the 3.7 per cent pay rise in 1995 and 4 per cent (or inflation) in 1996
while the unions insist that for many people the deal is worth 10.7 per
cent.
Many managers in the car industry are sceptical about the benefits Rover has
gained from its new deal. Many more of them - especially in the west
Midlands - will be cursing the Rover Group for setting a high-pay benchmark.
The current Jaguar negotiations, for example, seem likely to be affected.
But whatever the scepticism, Rover can point to some remarkable productivity
improvements. At Cowley, Oxford, for example, productivity has increased 30
per cent over the past two years. Overall productivity is up only 14 per
cent in that period, but that is partly because of the difficulty in
improving productivity at labour-intensive Land Rover.
The Rover management can also point to the fact that they are paying wages
according to the performance textbook. When the company was in trouble in
1992 it had a six-month pay freeze. Now that it is doing well, it is
allowing a pay catch-up.
In other words it is pay, rather than jobs, that is taking most of the
strain of market fluctuations. Since 1992 the company has stuck to its
commitment not to make anyone compulsorily redundant. Notwithstanding that
commitment, the company has still had some flexibility, with a reduction of
nearly 10 per cent in employee numbers between 1991 and 1993.
Since then job numbers have been rising and, unlike many other carmakers,
Rover has been taking people on open-ended contracts rather than temporary
contracts.
One economist with a leading employers' organisation said: 'When
productivity is rising as fast as it seems to have been at Rover, then both
workers and customers can benefit. In the past in the motor industry
productivity deals have either been bogus or most of the benefit has simply
returned to the workers with little or nothing going to customers in lower
prices.'

FT  08 OCT 94 / Bankers prepare to scrap the grouse shoot: Bronwen Maddox
and David Wighton ask whether Warburg's strategy is to blame for its
situation, or whether it reflects a downturn in investment banking fortunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in UK investment banks slid this week after warnings from SG Warburg
and Hambros Bank that first-half profits would be sharply lower. Wall Street
is braced for US banks' third-quarter results to show sharp earnings falls.
Warburg's rivals did their best this week to be discreet about taking
pleasure in its discomfort. One leading London banker said: 'I don't want to
be seen to criticise them, because it could be us next.'
That question - whether the UK's biggest investment bank is simply the first
of the pack to acknowledge the impact of difficult conditions - is at the
forefront of bankers' minds.
This week's announcements startled the markets because they came just months
after City and Wall Street houses doled out glittering bonuses. After years
of belt-tightening bankers as well as proprietors of wine bars, estate
agents for the most fashionable parts of London and Manhattan, and even the
sporting agents for grouse shooting in Scotland had started to believe the
good times were back.
They are not the only ones concerned about the prospect of another lean
period.
Banking regulators have been casting an increasingly sharp eye on banks'
exposure to risky activities. A new directive on capital adequacy - the
amount of capital banks are required to have in proportion to their level of
activity - has emerged from Brussels. In the US the Federal Reserve is
considering if banks' exposure to some of the riskiest financial instruments
should be more tightly monitored.
In Warburg's case it is clear that some of the disappointment stems from its
own circumstances. To a much greater degree than its UK rivals, it has
modelled itself for the past seven years on the US integrated investment
banks, offering a range of trading services as well as fee-based advice to
its clients. Its ambitious expansion, particularly into the US, has pushed
up costs, but revenues in some regions have followed more slowly.
While it has established a strong reputation for research and equity sales
on Wall Street, particularly for selling non-US stocks to US investment
houses, it has found it much harder to peel prized corporate clients away
from the blue-chip US houses. One Wall Street observer from a rival house
attributed this to Warburg's 'British, gentlemanly' approach, although Mr
Nick Verey, chairman of Warburg Securities, retorted that the US operations
are staffed mainly by Americans.
He said rising costs played only a small part in the half-year downturn, and
instead blamed most of the fall on the turbulence in world bond markets
since the Federal Reserve began to raise US interest rates on February 4.
Some observers believe Warburg may have suffered from its relative
inexperience in large-scale trading. Mr Martin Hughes, banking analyst at
Credit Lyonnais Laing, said: 'I think we will see that the banks that are
losing money are those that are less familiar with risk control methods.'
That is an argument which Mr Verey rejected. 'It is not the case that we
have lost large sums on trades, just that we have not been making enough
profit.' He added that he was satisfied with the risk-management systems on
which the bank spent millions of pounds a year.
His argument that Warburg's troubles reflect a wider phenomenon is borne out
by Hambros' report of a deterioration in profits in bond trading during the
first half. Analysts expect that other UK investment banks which have traded
on a smaller scale than Warburg, such as Kleinwort Benson, will have
suffered correspondingly less.
The pattern is repeated in the US, where the biggest traders have suffered
most. Goldman Sachs' profits are believed to have fallen from Dollars 1.2bn
(Pounds 750m) to Dollars 446m in the six months to May 27 because of a fall
in bond trading income. First-half net profits fell 44 per cent at Morgan
Stanley, 28 per cent at Bankers Trust and 19 per cent at J P Morgan. Salomon
Brothers recorded a first-half loss of Dollars 138m.
At first glance many of these banks appear to have suffered less than
Warburg, even though they are larger traders. Nor do they enjoy as healthy
an injection of profits from asset management as Warburg does. Timing is
partly to blame, however. Most US banks have so far reported only on profits
up to June, whereas Warburg's warning covered July, August and September,
when trading volumes shrivelled.
Analysts fear that third-quarter results from US banks, just starting to
trickle out, will show a further plunge. This week Salomon announced that
its third quarter would show an after-tax loss of Dollars 100m, and last
month Lehman Brothers, which announced that it was cutting free lunches for
its staff, saw third-quarter profits plunge 80 per cent to just Dollars 22m.
As many bankers stressed this week, trading is risky. Mr Verey said: 'There
is no perfect hedge against the risk - you have to take a risk to earn a
return.' In spite of this collective suffering, however, there are no signs
that leading integrated investment banks intend to rethink their strategy
and reduce their exposure to trading.
They still hold to the principle that they need a strong trading presence in
order to compete for higher-margin business of underwriting, placing blocks
of securities, and giving corporate advice.
But competition for big international corporate clients is increasing, as
demonstrated by the current scramble for a share of the
partial-privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, the telecommunications giant. The
result, one leading London banker said this week, was that investment
banking would become an ever more volatile business, in which banks would be
forced into increasingly risky activities, such as trading in derivatives.
That trend could deal a powerful advantage to the largest banks, which are
better able to withstand the markets' volatility. Analysts warn that it
could also put severe pressure on the smaller ones, such as Warburg. Mr
David Poutney, banking analyst at brokers Collins Stewart said: 'They
(Warburg's) are just going to get killed in the US every time.'
Although Mr Simon Leathes, Warburg group finance director, said that the
bank was not constrained by lack of capital, it is clearly dwarfed by its US
rivals. As the biggest of the UK merchant banks it has shareholders' funds
of Pounds 1bn and total capital resources of Pounds 1.5bn. However, Morgan
Stanley, Salomon and Bankers Trust are about three times the size while J P
Morgan's shareholders' funds are six times bigger.
Analysts predict that questions of capitalisation may eventually force some
banks to merge and others to withdraw from the most competitive sectors. But
for the moment radical strategic changes are unlikely. Mr Leathes said: 'You
do not tear up the script after a few difficult months.'
Some smaller tweaks to strategy can be expected. Warburg itself will look
harder at whether some advisory work should be subcontracted to law firms,
and at whether competing for small company business is worthwhile.
For Goldman's part, its senior partner elect, Mr Jon Corzine, said recently:
'There are lessons to be learned. You get overly optimistic in the bountiful
environment of bull markets. It was very easy in 1993 to think you ought to
have a presence in every capital market in every major country in the
world.'
Some bankers are also reconciled to the prospect of job cuts. Mr Verey, who
has announced a hiring freeze at Warburg, said: 'We will look to see whether
people need to be replaced when they leave.'
But in spite of these adjustments the message from both sides of the
Atlantic at the end of a sobering week was that the markets should not have
been surprised by the news. When markets are tough, banks will suffer. In
the course of economic cycles their profits will fluctuate.
The markets may have forgotten those facts in the heady atmosphere of last
year, but this week's news was a reminder that the path trodden by the
world's sleek-suited cohorts of investment bankers can be a rough one.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Underground achieves 75% service in spite of strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Underground ran three-quarters of its train services yesterday during
the 24-hour strike by members of the RMT union.
The union said last night that it was unable to estimate how many of its
7,500 members at London Underground had responded to the strike call.
London Underground was able to staff most of its services. Only one of
London's 270 Tube stations had to be closed and that reopened at lunchtime.
The worst effect may have been in low passenger volumes and lost revenue
because many people who normally travel by Tube made alternative
arrangements. Underground managers were unable to give passenger figures. On
an average day there are about 2.5m passenger journeys on the Tube system.
The greatest disruption occurred during rush hours. In off-peak hours, the
Underground said, it managed to run nine out of 10 trains.
The union executive is to meet on Monday to decide on further action. It has
asked for more talks at the Acas conciliation service, but London
Underground refuses to increase its offer of a 2.5 per cent rise.
The union has asked for a 4 per cent rise. Five other unions representing
Tube workers have accepted the 2.5 per cent deal.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Toyota considers expansion at Derby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Toyota, the Japanese car-maker, is considering the assembly of additional
derivatives of the Carina E family car range at its Burnaston plant near
Derby, Kevin Done writes.
The company is expected to announce later this year that it will assemble
diesel versions of the Carina range using engines imported from Japan.
It is also considering the expansion of the UK-built range of saloon and
hatchback cars with the addition of an estate car.
Toyota is expected to add a second car range to its UK production operations
in the second half of the 1990s, increasing capacity to 200,000 cars a year.
Output is expected to be nearly 90,000 cars this year and to rise to about
100,000 next year.
Toyota expects to sell about 110,000 Carina E cars in all versions in Europe
this year, of which about 80 per cent will be built in the UK.
The Japanese carmaker is facing difficult conditions in the west European
car market this year with its sales falling by 4.1 per cent in the first
eight months in an overall market that increased by 6 per cent.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Warburg credit rating unchanged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg has maintained its investment rating in spite of issuing a profit
warning earlier this week. Standard &amp; Poors, the US rating agency, has
assigned its A+ rating to SGW Finance's Dollars 250m guaranteed
floating-rate notes due in 1998. The UK investment bank won the renewed
grading even after this week's profits announcement.
S&amp;P's judgment allows Warburg to maintain its claim to be the only UK house
with a rating to match those of the most strongly capitalised US investment
banks.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Rail company switches to buses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the newly created train operating companies is to use buses for some
services on one of its branch lines because of a shortage of guards.
North London Railways said the shortage was not the result of the break-up
of British Rail. But its move has strengthened fears that small privatised
railway companies will face operating difficulties because they are unable
to call on resources from other parts of the railway network.
The train company initially announced plans to replace all services on its
Bedford to Bletchley branch line with buses so that it could assign staff to
the main Northampton-London Euston services.
But yesterday it said it had reached an agreement for some guards to work
12-hour shifts instead of the more normal eight hours, maintaining a train
service on the line for most of the day.
North London was caught out when 25 of the 97 guards at its Bletchley depot
were successful in their applications to move to other depots.
Guards sometimes wait years for the depot of their choice to come up. If a
guard is successful in his application he is allowed to move with-in eight
weeks, although it can take 13 weeks to train a new guard from scratch.
The shortage of guards has led to an increase in the number of train
cancellations. North London said it had decided to concentrate guards on its
main line, carrying 30,000 passengers a day, and to reduce its service on
the branch line, which carries only 800 passengers.
North London said that even under BR it would have taken time to retrain
guards from other routes. But Mr Alan Francis, transport spokesman for the
Green party, blamed the reduced service on privatisation, saying BR managers
could pool staff in times of shortage.
BR said service reductions because of staff shortages were unusual, and the
last time this happened was six or seven years ago.
North London said its temporary timetable involving buses would last until
November 21, when it would resume a full train service.
It said 43 new guards had been recruited or were being trained.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Sorrows drown in Pounds 50 bubbly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits may be down and the markets bearish, but the bubbly was still
flowing in the wine bars of London's financial centre this week.
'There is champagne being drunk, and people are still here past eight on a
weekday evening,' said a Lloyd's reinsurance broker, who was certainly
accurate about Corney and Barrow's wine bar in the City's Leadenhall market.
'I think it is hard to look at two isolated incidents of Warburg and Hambros
doing badly and suddenly say the entire City is nervous about its jobs.'
He shrugged and poured a generous glass of champagne for his companion. 'But
I'm in insurance so I couldn't say how it is over in the big banks.'
At Broadgate Circle, the heart of the City's banking district, the mood in
the watering holes was no less cheerful.
A trader at a Japanese bank quipped as he sank a beer: 'If you think this is
hopping, you should see the places where everyone has moved on to.'
He said the profit warnings issued last week by SG Warburg, the investment
bank, and Hambros, the merchant bank, appeared dismal only when compared
with the previous year's performance. 'Last year was not normal,' he said.
'The average person does not generate Dollars 10m revenue a year, but now
that he is only making Dollars 2m, suddenly everyone says it's a tragedy.'
If anything, the misfortunes of Warburg and Hambros elicited smirks rather
than signs of anxiety. 'They made their money too easy last year,' said a
trader in the structured finance department of Bank of Scotland, who was
relaxing with colleagues at The Arbitrager on Throgmorton Street. 'They made
their money for turning up at work.'
Under the influence of office sobriety, financiers admitted that the profit
warnings could signal tighter times. A derivatives risk manager at JP Morgan
said: 'Last year it was easy to hire a mediocre risk manager because it was
such an easy market to trade. What you will see after bonuses are paid is
that a two-tier system will develop.'
He said banks would continue to hire and pay 'quality' people well but, he
added: 'What I am hearing around is that people are getting rid of the
bottom 10 per cent of performers as they are rated internally.'
So is it curtains for ski holidays, Christmas bonuses and magnums of
champagne?
The revellers at Corney and Barrow in Broadgate scoffed as they ordered more
champagne. A trader at a UK bank said: 'At the end of the day people who
work in this industry make a lot more money than people in any other
business. So if they have a bad day and do not make a million, it's not as
if buying another bottle of Moet for Pounds 50 is going to be a problem.'

Clifton Stockbrokers, a long-established private client broker based in
Torquay, has been ordered to cease carrying on investment business by the
Securities &amp; Futures Authority, David Wighton writes.
The regulator said the firm was 'not fit and proper to carry out investment
business and has committed serious acts of misconduct'.
These related to its failure to meet its financial resources requirement
laid down by the SFA and to 'organise and control its internal affairs in a
responsible manner'. In particular the SFA said the firm had failed to
register all its directors.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Labour attacks ex-minister's move to City: MacGregor
appointment as deputy chairman of Hill Samuel condemned as 'sleazy and
scandalous'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A move by Mr John MacGregor, former transport secretary, to rejoin merchant
bank Hill Samuel sparked a political row last night as Labour attacked the
system which gives former ministers freedom to take City directorships.
Mr Brian Wilson, the opposition transport spokesman, said he would raise the
appointment in the Commons when MPs return to Westminster in 10 days' time.
Hill Samuel, a subsidiary of TSB Bank, is advising the Department of
Transport on the Channel Tunnel Rail link. It was selected to advise on the
rail link in August last year after a competition among a number of banks.
Mr MacGregor asked to take no part in the selection process because of his
former links with the bank. Under government rules there are no restrictions
on ministers taking jobs in the private sector which have connections with
their previous ministerial posts.
But Mr Wilson said Hill Samuel's involvement in the Channel tunnel link
meant that Mr MacGregor's appointment as non-executive deputy chairman was
'completely unacceptable'. He said: 'Hill Samuel are the direct
beneficiaries of Mr MacGregor's policies, particularly in relation to the
Channel tunnel link.'
Accusing the Conservatives of 'sleazy and scandalous' behaviour, Mr Wilson
said: 'It is completely unacceptable that the secretary of state at the time
of Hill Samuel's appointment should immediately move over from government to
boardroom.' He added that 'common decency dictated that Mr MacGregor should
have steered clear of companies which were direct beneficiaries of his own
policies'. Downing Street indicated that it saw no conflict of interest.
The row follows a series of attacks at the Labour conference in Blackpool on
the jobs taken by former ministers. The opposition's opinion polling shows
that the charge has a resonance with the electorate.
Rules issued by the cabinet office say there are no formal restrictions on
former ministers taking up private-sector posts other than those which apply
to all backbench MPs. The rules add that former ministers should avoid any
actions which reflect adversely on their or the government's reputation.
Mr MacGregor worked at Hill Samuel for 11 years before his 15-year
ministerial career. He remains MP for South Norfolk.
Before he became transport secretary in 1992 he served as chief secretary to
the Treasury, minister of agriculture, education secretary, Lord President
of the Council and leader of the Commons.
Mr Hugh Freedberg, Hill Samuel's chief executive, said Mr MacGregor's
experience would be valuable in continuing to develop the business in the UK
and internationally.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Disease link with meat 'inconclusive'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A government-funded study released yesterday shows an apparent link between
eating meat and Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease, the human equivalent of BSE or
'mad cow disease'.
But the researchers said the statistical association was almost certainly a
result of the way the study had been done rather than evidence that meat
consumption could cause CJD.
The annual report of the CJD surveillance unit in Edinburgh said the number
of CJD cases in the UK fell from 55 in 1992 to 40 last year after rising for
the three previous years.
Statistical analysis of the cases showed no occupational link. People
working with animals were no more likely than others to develop CJD.
CJD victims were more likely than matched control subjects to have been
regular eaters of meat, particularly veal. Dr Robert Will, the unit's
director, attributed this finding to 'recall bias'. He said the only way of
learning about CJD victims' diet was to ask their relatives, who
inadvertently exaggerated the amount of meat eaten because there had been
publicity about a possible link between BSE and CJD through beef or veal
consumption.
To support the 'recall bias' theory Dr Will said there was a similar excess
of veal eaters among people who were suspected of having CJD when their
relatives were asked about their diet but who actually turned out to have
died from Alzheimer's Disease and other forms of dementia.
The study concludes: 'There is no conclusive evidence of any chance in CJD
that can be attributable to BSE.'
It says the apparent increase in CJD since the 1970s has been caused mainly
by the fact that the disease is being recognised in people over 75 who would
previously have been diagnosed as having senile dementia.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Interest rate rise scares house buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The housing market has been 'knocked sideways' by last month's half
percentage point rise in interest rates, according to a survey of more than
200 estate agents.
Some 60 per cent of agents said market activity, in terms of the number of
people interested in buying, had declined since the interest rate rise.
The survey published by the National Association of Estate Agents said the
rise had dented the confidence of potential buyers causing a 'significant
downturn in business'.
Mrs Eva Lomas, the association's president, said the base rate increase,
although small, had prompted a disproportionate fall in confidence.
She said: 'Although interest rates are still at historically low levels, the
improvement in the economy is not being translated into confidence among the
public and talk about further rate rises can only make the situation worse.'
The association's market trends survey for September showed a significant
fall in the level of inquiries, viewings, offers and completions compared
with August. Only 23 per cent of agents expected the market to strengthen
before the end of the year compared with 60 per cent in August.
Nearly half of all agents said that business generally had fared worse last
month than in September 1993.
A separate survey by the Nationwide Building Society showed that average
house prices in the third quarter of this year were higher compared with the
corresponding period a year ago in 10 out of 13 regions.
The average UK house price in the third quarter, according to Nationwide,
was Pounds 66,012, up 1.1 per cent on the second quarter and 2.9 per cent
higher than a year ago.
The biggest annual increases to the third quarter were 9.1 per cent in the
east Midlands and 7.9 per cent in Northern Ireland. However, prices fell by
1.8 per cent in the north-west; 2.8 per cent in the west Midlands and by 6.2
per cent in the northern region.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Howard will fight on basis of past record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Howard will next week try to draw a line under what has been an
immensely difficult year by portraying himself to Tory activists as the home
secretary who has delivered.
With his competence increasingly under question after a string of mishaps Mr
Howard's speech at next week's Conservative conference in Bournemouth is
expected to draw heavily on the traditional Tory home secretary's pledges to
crack down on crime and promote law and order.
But it will also focus on his record in the past 12 months, pointing out
that he has already implemented the vast majority of the 27 law and order
initiatives he unveiled at last year's conference.
In response to Tory grass-roots concern about the nature of sentences handed
out to some offenders, the speech is likely to contain a passage on the
importance of punishment, arguing that prison conditions should be 'decent
but austere' and that prisoners' privileges must be earned.
This theme was highlighted yesterday in a speech on community sentencing by
Lady Blatch, the Home Office minister, in Scarborough. She emphasised that
sentences in the community should be an effective form of punishment and not
a reward for offending.
Mr Howard's difficulties this year included the savaging in the House of
Lords of two major pieces of Home Office legislation and the discovery of
Semtex at Whitemoor prison.
Conference managers have done their best to shield him from excessive media
exposure, scheduling his speech for Thursday afternoon during what looks set
to be conference's most packed day.
But such is the opprobrium heaped on his recent performance, both from
within Tory ranks and outside, that it appears unlikely that strong
competition from cabinet colleagues Mr Kenneth Clarke, Mrs Gillian Shephard
and Sir Patrick Mayhew will be enough to keep Mr Howard off the Friday's
front pages.
There is a growing feeling among some observers that Mr Howard could be in
danger of the same fate as Mr John Patten, the former education secretary,
who was in effect left to soldier on as a lame-duck minister before being
ousted in the ministerial reshuffle last July.
Anything less than an enthusiastic reception from delegates would be seen as
another step down this slippery slope.

people working for nothing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Colin, a 23-year-old graduate in acoustic engineering, spent two months this
year working for nothing, except expenses, at a well-established
London-based film production company.
The result was a reference which secured him a job as a studio manager in a
media company.
'It was rather like a long job interview,' said Colin, who was surprised at
the amount of responsibility he was given. 'About half the people in the
company where I was working started the same way, including the general
manager.'
An increasing number of young people like Colin are offering to take
short-term, unpaid employment to gain a foothold in their chosen profession.
It is a sensitive area - there is a fine line between gaining genuine work
experience and simply working for nothing.
Genuine work experience is part of much school and college-based training.
For example, Pathfinders Personnel, the London - based media subsidiary of
Angela Mortimer, the secretarial consultancy, arranges work experience of up
to four weeks with a range of employers on behalf of secretarial colleges.
In the past two years it has made about 1,000 such placements and expects
more next year.
Ms Amanda Fone, a director of the consultancy, said that in a competitive
labour market more and more companies were pleased to take students for a
short time. 'Work experience is not replacing the interview, but rather
becoming part of it, with many employers recruiting young people they have
met on work experience,' she said.
The consultancy checked that companies were treating individuals properly.
'We ask students to contact us if at any stage they feel exploited. But, at
the same time, we have to be realistic,' she said. 'Sometimes students are
asked to do bits of photocopying - but that is different from doing it eight
hours a day.'
Nevertheless misuse of work experience does occur and there is anecdotal
evidence that the practice has increased in the recession, particularly in
non-unionised companies.
Work substitution of this kind may be particularly common in areas young
people perceive as glamorous, such as the media, where the fragmentation of
the industry and growth of freelance work has diluted the power of trade
unions to stop longer-term placements where they may believe unpaid workers
are doing the jobs of full-time workers.
Bectu, the broadcasting trade union, where membership has fallen from 60,000
to 35,000 in the past four years, said: 'We try to make it as difficult as
we can for managements to abuse work experience.'
It pointed to what it considered to be an associated problem in the film
industry, where crews are paid less than Pounds 2 an hour with the prospect
of more money only after the film has repaid its investors.
One problem for those on unpaid work experience is whether to continue to
claim unemployment benefits. The lack of clear rules discourages individuals
from declaring what they are doing.
It is not generally difficult for the person to satisfy the Employment
Service that they are available for work. But the income support regulations
operated by the Benefits Agency are more difficult to navigate.
If a claimant tells the BA about doing unpaid work, an independent
adjudication officer will decide whether it is reasonable to do that work on
a voluntary basis.
If the decision is that it is reasonable, all expenses relating to travel
and meals are disregarded. The agency said the difficult part was assessing
whether the job was truly voluntary, and the labour was extra to that
provided by paid workers. 'Obviously any charitable status of the employer
or task would have a bearing on the decision,' it said.
Sometimes individuals are able to incorporate unpaid work experience into
government training schemes. Florence, aged 27, was offered unpaid work
experience by the Open University. 'The OU offered me experience but said
they could not pay me for it,' she said.
Her local Jobcentre arranged for her training at the OU to be under the
state training programme for the unemployed, then called Employment
Training.
Florence said: 'Once they trusted me I got a lot of responsibility.' She got
up at 6am every day to travel from Leicester to the OU at Milton Keynes.
'But they did not take me on to avoid taking somebody else on full-time. At
no point did I feel exploited.'
Florence was offered a job at the OU. She did not take it as she was also
offered one at the BBC, which had been impressed by her CV. But 'it was
wonderful to be given the chance to perform at the OU'.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Pension reform levy attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pensions industry said yesterday that government proposals for funding
new pensions regulation would discourage occupational schemes.
The National Association of Pension Funds criticised Department of Social
Security proposals to make employers pay for the setting up and maintenance
of the proposed pensions regulator.
The NAPF is staking its position in advance of legislation due to come
before parliament this autumn.
The government has put forward plans for a levy on the industry to finance
the estimated Pounds 10m cost of the new office and has estimated the total
burden of the reforms will be between Pounds 60m and Pounds 140m. The
pension funds argue the expense could be 10 times that and may inhibit
occupational pensions.
'Our members support the . . . recommendation that the cost of regulation
should fall on the state,' said Mr Ron Amy, the NAPF chairman. 'It should
not be borne by employers who choose to provide pensions for their
employees.'
The NAPF statement backs the position of the Goode committee on pensions law
reform. The committee, set up after Mr Robert Maxwell had raided his
companies' pension funds, called for an independent state-financed regulator
to ensure there was no repetition of the Maxwell affair.
Goode recommended appointment of a new independent pensions regulator with
the power to intervene and impose sanctions - and financed by the
government. The government took many of the ideas on board in its white
paper but watered down the power and independence of the regulator.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Homeowners pick direct insurers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Direct insurers, selling via the telephone and advertisements, are proving
increasingly adept at persuading homeowners to switch house content and
structure policies, according to a survey by the NOP market research group.
In the first six months of this year, more than half of those who took out a
combined structure and contents policy for the first time did so through a
building society, the survey shows.
But direct insurers, in spite of acquiring only 4 per cent of all first-time
customers, attracted 21 per cent of those changing their policies from one
business to another.
'Consumers' experience with motor insurance has taught them to shop around
for the best price. They are now using this experience in other markets -
including household insurance,' said Ms Heather McAdam, director of NOP's
financial division.
She added that the housing insurance market was proving 'increasingly
dynamic. Although building societies are still acquiring the majority of
first-time customers, they are finding it more and more difficult to retain
this business'. The survey was based on interviews with 60,000 adults.
NOP suggests that if the current trend continues, societies could begin to
lose market share rapidly. It also finds that combined insurance policies
are becoming increasingly popular - evidence that companies are putting more
emphasis on cross-selling and promoting combined insurance products.

Mr Roy Wharton, the former chairman of Castlegate Securities, a
Reading-based loan management company, was yesterday sentenced to five
years' imprisonment for fraudulently mishandling Pounds 35m of investors'

He was convicted last month at Oxford Crown Court of two charges of
fraudulent trading. Having given assurances about the security of
investments, Mr Wharton pursued a speculative strategy which meant investors
bore most of the risk while he reaped the financial benefits.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Clinton lays into Republican opponents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday launched a fierce attack on his Republican
foes in Congress, after weeks in which he has appeared to accept meekly
their repeated and mostly successful efforts to thwart every bill he has
tried to get enacted.
As members of Congress tried to wrap up their final legislative business
before going home to campaign for the November 8 election, Mr Clinton blamed
'partisan gridlock by the Republican congressional leadership' for blocking
reforms of health care, campaign finance, lobbying rules and environmental
legislation.
'Too many times an idea for creating jobs, reforming government, educating
students or expanding income, fighting crime or cleaning up the environment
or reforming the political system was met by someone trying to stop it, slow
it, kill it or just talk it to death,' Mr Clinton said at a White House news
conference.
In recent weeks Mr Clinton has appeared reluctant to criticise his political
opponents, perhaps in an effort to salvage some vestige of co-operation from
an increasingly antagonistic and partisan legislative session, and perhaps
for fear of alienating Republican support he is counting on to win
ratification of the trade liberalisation measures negotiated in the Uruguay
Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
But the White House this week had to give up hopes of passing Gatt before
Congress recessed, settling for a lame duck session at the end of November,
after the election.
Yesterday's attack appeared, therefore, to mark the president's decision to
move into the political trenches ahead of an election in which the
Republicans are increasingly hopeful of winning control of at least one, if
not both houses of Congress.
Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, chairman of the Republican senate campaign
committee, yesterday predicted his party could go 'substantially over 50'
seats in the Senate, where 35 of the 100 seats are up for election,
overturning the 56 to 44 Democratic majority.
Mr Gramm said that he expected Republican candidates to hold two of the
three states where Republican senators were retiring, and that Republicans
were level or leading in 11 states now held by Democratic senators.
Mr Haley Barbour, the Republican party chairman, said his party could take
control of the House of Representatives, where all 435 seats are at stake,
as well as the Senate.
But Republican strategists appear to be adding around 25 seats to their
current 178 to give them working control in alliance with right-wing
Democrats, rather than the 40 additional seats necessary for an outright
majority.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Fed-watchers kept guessing on rates: George Graham assesses
the impact of the latest jobs figures on the likelihood of another interest
rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the Federal Reserve's policy makers wanted a nice, clear indication of
the pace of the US economy's expansion from last month's employment
statistics, they will have been disappointed.
That means that Fed-watchers, too, will have to wait a while longer before
they see whether the US central bank will move short-term interest rates
still higher in an effort to slow the economy's momentum before inflationary
pressures build up.
Yesterday's announcement offered a battery of contradictions. A drop in the
unemployment rate to 5.9 per cent, from 6.1 per cent in August, was balanced
by a relatively modest increase of 239,000 in September in the number of
non-farm jobs; that in turn was offset by a sharp revision upwards in the
number of jobs created in August to 246,000, rather than the weak 179,000
originally reported a month ago.
These conflicting signals confused the financial markets yesterday, and did
little to change the opinions of private sector economists who have, for the
most part, already placed their bets on the likelihood that the Fed will
decide to raise interest rates another notch before the next meeting of its
policy-setting Federal Open Markets Committee on November 15.
And they appear unlikely to have changed many minds at the Fed, whose last
FOMC meeting 10 days ago decided to leave rates unchanged, leaving more time
to see whether its increase of half a percentage point on August 16 will
have its intended effect of slowing the economy's momentum.
The delay will irritate many in the financial markets, which have shown
increasing impatience at what they see as irrefutable signs that the economy
is still growing at an unsustainably fast pace in the third quarter, and
have made clear their view that the Fed is 'behind the curve' by pushing
long term interest rates above 8 per cent. But they may be underestimating
the degree to which Fed officials believe they have acted in advance of
inflationary pressures this year.
Fed officials warn that monetary policy is an uncertain business, with long
and variable lags between a change in interest rates and its effect on the
economy, and point out that they have already raised the federal funds rate,
which banks charge each other on overnight balances, by 1 3/4 percentage
points this year.
Senior members of the FOMC, in recent speeches around the country, have
appeared more worried about justifying to business leaders the fact that
they have raised interest rates so far and so fast than about justifying to
Wall Street their failure to move even further and faster.
Mr Robert Forrestal, president of the Atlanta Fed, told a meeting in Alabama
this week that he expects growth to slow to around 3 1/2 per cent for the
whole of this year and to around 3 per cent in 1995.
And Mr Robert Parry, president of the San Francisco Fed, told the Los
Angeles Bond Club on Wednesday that the FOMC had been 'a little bold to move
this early.' The effects of the most recent increase, he added, had 'yet to
be felt'.
'Such forward-looking monetary policy helps avoid the go-stop economic
environment of the late '70s and early '80s, and it's much more likely to
produce a lasting economic expansion,' Mr Parry said.
Nevertheless, two of the indicators to which the Fed is generally believed
to pay particular attention - the unemployment rate and the industrial
capacity utilisation rate - are now signalling that the economy is running
at or beyond a pace which it can sustain without succumbing to inflation.
Calculations of the natural rate of unemployment, below which wage pressures
start to build, vary. Few estimates, however, are much lower than
September's rate of 5.9 per cent, and most Fed estimates are above 6 per
cent.
Similarly, the Fed reported last month that the rate of capacity utilisation
rose to 84.7 per cent in August, nearly one percentage point higher than
reported in July and close to the level of 85 per cent at which industry is
conventionally believed to start facing production bottlenecks and raising
prices.
In fact, some Fed economists calculate that inflationary pressures begin
even earlier, at around 81.8 per cent utilisation.
September's capacity utilisation rate is due to be reported next Friday. But
the financial markets may have to wait a little longer to see whether the
Fed feels that it needs to raise interest rates further to take some more
steam out of the economy.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Bumper stickers cannot fix unruly, dirty and unlovely
Bogota: City elections are focusing on social problems underlying the
physical decay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bogota is an unruly, dirty and unlovely city. It has outgrown its transport,
sewerage and water systems, and there are 14 murders a day. As Mr Antanas
Mockus, the candidate in mayoral elections on October 30 who leads the
opinion polls by a large margin, told a hall full of students: 'You can't
fix Bogota by putting 'I love Bogota' stickers on your car. Instead, say 'I
hate it, but I'll do something to improve it'.'
Sick of empty electoral promises, Bogotanos have warmed to Mr Mockus's
candid prescriptions. He is making no political pacts and his popularity
scared the Liberals and Conservatives into discussing an alliance for the
local government elections. When this fell through, Mr Enrique Penalosa of
the Liberal party was left as the other contender.
Fuelled by migrants from all over the country, the population of Bogota has
grown at more than 4.5 per cent a year during the last decade to 6.3m. With
about 16 per cent of Colombia's inhabitants and a third of its industry, the
capital sprawls out from a ridge of mountains across a high plain, eating up
rich farmland. The winter rains bring landslides to poor hillside barrios
and floods to lower lying ones.
Although many businesses have moved north from the original centre, public
sector offices are still largely concentrated in the town centre. A few
streets of pretty colonial and early republican buildings survive in the
Candelaria area in the city centre, but only three blocks from the
presidential palace there are street walkers, drug dealers and any number of
thieves carrying knives up their sleeves.
From time to time plans to remove the army of street sellers from the main
avenues and to revamp parts of the centre are announced; but such enormous
social problems underlie the physical decay that no mayor has had the
courage to tackle them.
Mr Mockus, a mathematician and philosophy professor, took on one of the more
difficult jobs in the country when he became rector of the anarchic National
University. He resigned after television news programmes showed him
'mooning' (making a crude gesture of defiance) at a noisy university
audience which would not let him speak, but students think well of him.
'He's an intellectual in a million, a very good teacher. The university
reforms he implemented have been successful - he's too far ahead on some
things, though; people haven't his vision,' said a graduate student.
The key to changing Bogota, according to Mr Mockus, is civic culture. All
problems, including pollution, transport, security and tax collection could
be resolved more cheaply if people's attitudes changed. This message, which
forms the core of his programme, has been well received in a city where
corruption is rife and cries for help rarely answered. A recent study by the
mayor's office found the lack of civic solidarity to be people's foremost
complaint, followed by transport, violence and administrative incompetence.
The next mayor will have little to spend unless he can cut back on operating
expenses. The capital has 60,000 on its payroll, including teachers.
'Bogota's financial situation has been deteriorating since the 1970s,' said
Ms Maria Eugenia Avendano, in charge of UN projects at city hall. 'Service
tariffs hardly changed and the money went to pay off multilateral loans. Now
there's been a big increase in the industry and trade tax and more people
are paying the property tax. Debts of the public service companies have been
refinanced, so there'll be something over for investment.'
Catching up on service provision is one of the priorities - only 60 per cent
of households are linked to the main sewerage system and more than 200,000
water connections are illegal. Every year unauthorised barrios sprout on
vacant lots; sometimes these take-overs are sponsored by unscrupulous
politicians in search of votes. People living in areas such as Ciudad
Bolivar, a vast conglomeration of low income barrios, resort to strikes to
get the city to solve their most glaring problems.
One of these is transport. Bogota has had no long-term transport or planning
strategy and roads have been widened and fly-overs thrown up in a haphazard
way. The number of vehicles has risen to over 600,000, boosted by the
liberalisation of imports. There are 50 bus companies and nearly 90 per cent
of all trips are made on public transport, so it is not surprising a rapid
transit system is regularly debated.
The British company Halcrow Fox analysed a series of proposals for transport
strategies. 'The evaluation process was very useful,' said Mr Mauricio
Cuellar, a transport specialist working with the local administration. 'It
allowed us to arrive at a long-term project which attacks the main zones of
congestion and central area access problems.'
This would include a north-south metro line, combined with east-west bus
highways.
The metro is an expensive solution and would need a substantial contribution
from the central government, which has promised special help for Bogota. It
is one of the items on a list prepared by the Bogota 2000 planning team,
along with the decontamination of the River Bogota, the establishment of
free trade zones and a host of projects.
As an attempt to involve Bogotanos in the discussion of their future and the
choice between investment alternatives, the Bogota 2000 exercise is
gathering steam. Mr Mockus thinks it is a good idea and wants to build on
it. But his battle is not only to beat the powerful Liberal party machinery:
if he wins, the unorthodox professor will have to govern the capital with
virtually no city councillors to back him.

FT  08 OCT 94 / US unemployment at four-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US unemployment rate dropped to 5.9 per cent last month, its lowest rate
for four years, but other statistics published yesterday showed the pace of
job creation slowing.
The department of labour said the number of jobs outside the farm sector
rose by 239,000 in September to 114.1m, after seasonal adjustment, with
private sector employment rising by 174,000 to 95m.
Most economists said this growth was more modest than expected, even though
it was offset by an upwards revision to non-farm jobs in August.
Financial markets had hoped the employment report, the first significant
indication of September's economic conditions, would give a clear picture of
whether the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates again to slow
the economic expansion to a less inflationary pace.
But the data offered mixed signals. After an initial fall, the US Treasury
30-year bond climbed  17/32 to 95 9/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.907
per cent late in the session. Stocks followed bonds upwards, the Dow Jones
Industrial Aver age finished 21.87 higher to 3,797.43.
In all, the number of jobs in the US has risen by 3m so far this year, but
the pace of job creation has slowed from an average of 396,000 a month in
the first quarter to an average of 258,000 a month over the July to
September quarter.
These figures are based on a labour department survey of businesses, and are
generally regarded as more accurate than the survey of households, which is
used to produce the overall unemployment rate.
That rate has fallen from 6.7 per cent in January to 5.9 per cent in
September, but interpretation has been complicated by a change at the
beginning of this year in data collection methods.
Nevertheless, the current rate is lower than most economists' estimates of
the 'natural rate of unemployment', below which workers start to bid wages
up. Average hourly earnings in the private sector rose by 0.3 per cent last
month to Dollars 11.16, and stand 2.6 per cent higher than they did a year
ago. But with an increase in overtime, weekly earnings averaged Dollars
386.14, up 0.6 per cent on last month and 3.2 per cent over the last year.
While many Wall Street economists argue that interest rates will have to
rise again to quell inflationary pressures, businesses have been worried
that the Fed, which raised its short term interest rates for the fifth time
this year on August 16, might choke the economy into a recession.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Haiti pullout before February 1996
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US officials assured Congress yesterday they expected American forces to
leave Haiti by February 1996 at the latest, but the White House said it was
relieved Capitol Hill had not set a definite pullout date, Reuter reports
from Washington.
'We fully expect that the entire operation in all of its phases will be over
by February 1996, which is the date specified in the relevant UN
resolution,' defence undersecretary Walter Slocombe told a hearing of the
House of Representatives armed services committee.
'We are very conscious of the risk of getting sucked into things that seem
like good ideas at the time that get us deeper and deeper in,' Mr Slocombe
said.
'And we are going to resist that temptation.'
The White House said President Clinton wanted to withdraw US troops as soon
as possible, but was pleased Congress had not demanded it by a certain date
in a resolution passed on Thursday calling for a quick pullout.
'I think the president is obviously gratified that they did not include a
certain date' for removing the troops, White House press secretary Dee Dee
Myers said.
'And the president certainly agrees with the notion that the troops ought to
be withdrawn as soon as possible,' she said.
The Senate and House voted Thursday to approve a non-binding resolution
urging a prompt, orderly pullout of US forces, but didn't set a date. The
Senate resolution also chided the president for refusing to seek
congressional authorisation for the September 19 military intervention in
Haiti.
Ms Myers said it was 'no secret' that many lawmakers had wanted Mr Clinton
to ask for congressional approval prior to the intervention, and that he had
a 'longstanding disagreement' with Capitol Hill on the subject.
'I think he (Clinton) has outlined what the conditions for withdrawal are -
a secure environment that allows us to turn the situation over to the UN,'
Ms Myers said.
Mr Slocombe said
the US military operation is limited to restoring President Jean Bertrand
Aristide, assuring parliamentary elections this year and presidential
elections by the end of next year.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Airport to expand as protestors relent

<TEXT>
The Japanese government is expected to announce plans next week to increase
capacity at Tokyo's overcrowded Narita international airport, following a
deal with anti-airport pressure groups who have blocked expansion for almost
30 years.
Mr Shizuka Kamei, the transport minister, said his ministry had accepted a
proposal from mediators that would settle its dispute with farmers and other
groups hostile to the airport. He declined to comment on the details of the
plan but it is understood to provide for the construction of one additional
runway at the airport, 40 miles north-east of Tokyo.
Farmers and environmentalists successfully held up the original construction
of the airport for more than a decade and have vehemently opposed any
expansion, but they are understood to have agreed to the mediators'
proposal. It calls upon the government to suspend plans for a third runway
and not to press ahead with the construction of the second before completing
extensive consultations with farmers and residents affected.
The transport ministry had originally proposed the construction of two more
runways at the site to meet the rapidly growing demand for landing slots. An
estimated 38m passengers are expected to use the airport in 2006, compared
with 22m now. Airlines from 43 countries are awaiting permission for landing
rights at Narita.
The compromise is expected to be formally approved at a final round of
negotiations next Tuesday. However, the consultation process is expected to
take several years to complete before construction of the runway can begin.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Japan's trade surplus falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan yesterday reported a 15.7 per cent decline in the current account
surplus in the year to August, the first drop in three months.
The improvement, hot on the heels of last weekend's settlement of the latest
US-Japan trade row, reinforces the finance ministry's contention that the
surplus is passing its peak.
The drop, to Dollars 6.16bn from Dollars 7.31bn in the same month last year,
comes partly as a result of a surge in energy imports caused by an unusually
hot summer, plus an underlying pick-up in consumer demand. It is becoming
clearer that Japan is heading for economic recovery, Mr Yasushi Mieno,
governor of the Bank of Japan, said yesterday.
Within the overall current account gap, the manufacturing trade surplus fell
by 4 per cent to Dollars 8.65bn, while trade in services showed a Dollars
1.57bn deficit, 39 per cent more than the services deficit in August last
year. Exports of goods rose by 12.2 per cent to Dollars 30.39bn, while
imports grew rather faster, by 20.3 per cent to Dollars 21.74bn.
A recent sharp rise in the outflow of long term capital continued in August,
at Dollars 15.97bn, well over twice the Dollars 6.8bn capital outflow in the
same month of last year. This is mainly due to an increase in Euro-yen bonds
issued overseas by Japanese companies, in search of cheaper capital in less
regulated foreign markets. Sales by foreign investors of Japanese shares and
bonds held in Tokyo played a smaller part in August's capital outflow than
was the case in July.
Yesterday's fall in the surplus helped to ease pressure on the yen, so that
the dollar rose Y0.47 to close at Y100.02 in Tokyo yesterday, the highest
since September 1.

FT  08 OCT 94 / China defiant after second nuclear test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday ignored appeals for a moratorium on nuclear testing and
strongly defended its second underground test in four months.
The Chinese insist that they lag well behind other nuclear powers in
testing. 'Among all the nuclear states, China has conducted the least
nuclear tests,' the foreign ministry said. China is believed to have
conducted 41 tests compared with 1,000 by the US.
Beijing said it remained committed to a comprehensive nuclear test ban
treaty by 1996 and repeated its proposals for treaties on the
'non-first-use' of nuclear weapons and the removal of threats of nuclear
attack against non-nuclear weapon states.
But western governments lodged protests over the test at the Lop Nor site in
far-western Xinjiang province. Britain 'regretted' the test and Australia
instructed its embassy in Beijing to 'convey its concerns'. Russia expressed
regret and concern and advised Beijing to rethink its policy. Mr Miguel
Marin-Bosch, chairman of the conference on disarmament committee on a
nuclear test ban said in Geneva the latest blast was 'not conducive' to
advancing the 39-nation negotiations.
The foreign ministry in Beijing said China would end its nuclear tests once
a comprehensive test ban treaty came into effect. 'China is actively
participating in the negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty
held in Geneva and hopes to see the conclusion of the treaty at the earliest
possible date or no later than 1996,' it said.
Australia's seismological centre in Canberra detected the test early
yesterday and said the detonation was consistent with a
medium-to-large-explosion. Yield was estimated at the equivalent of 40-150
kilotonnes of TNT.
China conducted its last test in June in spite of demands by the US and
Japan to refrain. Beijing has steadfastly refused to join a US-sponsored
two-year moratorium.
The foreign ministry official said China possessed a small quantity of
nuclear weapons 'solely for the purpose of self defence.' He urged nuclear
weapons states to agree to the destruction of all nuclear weapons soon.
In Canberra, Mr Gordon Bilney, Australia's acting foreign minister, said
China's continued testing was 'out of step with the positive atmosphere' of
negotiations on a comprehensive test ban.
'China must come to terms with the imminent fact of a ban on nuclear testing
for all time and in all environments,' Mr Bilney said.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Beijing to set up HK shadow body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China is to set up a special committee in Hong Kong in the run-up to the
1997 takeover to review legislation and recommend appointments to the
judiciary.
Beijing's announcement of a 'civil legislative committee' in direct
competition with Hong Kong's Legislative Council deals another blow to
Sino-British co-operation.
The official China Daily reported that the new committee would 'oversee
areas currently being supervised by the Legislative Council'.
China was compelled to take this step after the British Hong Kong government
closed the door to co-operation with China, the newspaper said.
China's declaration came 48 hours after Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten made
the conciliatory offer of allowing officials of his administration informal
contacts with Beijing's preliminary working committee - the body set up to
prepare for Chinese rule.
Previously, Mr Patten had banned any contact between Hong Kong officials and
the PWC whose establishment last year was widely regarded as an attempt to
undermine British authority.
Mr Patten made his offer in his third policy speech as governor, but China's
response was dismissive. This reflects the parlous state of Sino-British
relations.
British officials said that while the formation of a new committee to review
legislation would be 'unhelpful' the body would not come into being until it
was approved next year by the National People's Congress  - China's
parliament.
They also noted that until 1997 the committee would serve no practical
function since it would have no authority to amend or reject legislation, or
make appointments. Its recommendations would not take effect until
sovereignty passed to China.
But these officials said that Beijing's negative reaction to Mr Patten's
attempts at conciliation this week hardly augured well for increased
co-operation.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Australia acts to deregulate utilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA plans new rules on competition next year which will allow for
deregulation of utilities and pave the way for the eventual creation of a
national power grid, its treasurer, Mr Ralph Willis said in London
yesterday.
The changes, first proposed in the Hilmer report on national competition
policy, involve the application of competition rules to previously exempted
sectors, including businesses controlled by the governments of individual
states.
Mr Willis said the proposals, which would also introduce competition rules
to the professions and statutory bodies for marketing commodities, were 'the
most significant element' of the government's programme for structural
reform.
The new rules would give the federal government legal powers to restructure
the power industry so that separate entities could be responsible for power
generation, transmission and distribution as is now the case in Britain.
This would remove state governments' effective monopoly on local electricity
supply by forcing open the distribution network to all generators, a
particular breakthrough given Australia's federal constitution which hinders
national de-regulation of utilities.
'We think it appropriate that we have a national grid so that we can remove
excess capacity and generate competitive presures on pricing,' Mr Willis
said.
The new rules might also pave the way for privatisation of state electric
utilities, but 'the principal thing is to have competition,' he said.
Mr Willis said the federal government planned to finalise the necessary
legislative package by February next year and set in train the necessary
institutional arrangements by mid-1995.
Eventually a similar approach could be applied to gas supply. National
efforts were also under way to improve rail communications, Mr Willis said.

Estimates of insurance losses from the Los Angeles earthquake last January
have been raised from Dollars 7.2bn to Dollars 9bn after a surprising number
of new claims, the American Insurance Services Group said. More than 100 new
claims a day are being reported by insurance companies, the group said.
About 350,000 claims have now been received by insurers. Homeowners' losses
represent 76 per cent of claims, with commercial losses accounting for an
additional 12 per cent. The heavy losses reflect the thrust-fault motion of
the earthquake which exerted enormous forces on structures. The earthquake
hit the heavily populated area of north-west Los Angeles on January 14,
causing extensive damage over a wide area.

China, under strong pressure from the US to protect copyrights and patents,
ordered its courts yesterday to wage war on violators of intellectual
property rights, The Supreme People's Court of China issued a circular to
all civilian, military and special courts to 'conscientiously study and
research .. laws governing protection of intellectual property rights', the
official People's Daily said yesterday.
Foreign businessmen in China have expressed concerns over the abilities of
courts to deal with the often highly technical nature of copyright issues.
According to the circular, courts have been advised to select people with
foreign language abilities and background in science and engineering to take
part in copyright violation trials. The courts were also told to resist
protectionism in local governments and other government agencies.

Stranded Indian commuters went on a rampage yesterday, burning railway
carriages, looting shops and attacking buses after a derailed train halted
peak-hour traffic into Bombay. Irate commuters attacked railway property at
about 11 suburban railway stations, beating up railway staff, burning
furniture and stealing cash from ticket offices. At least 34 people were
taken to hospital, including 20 railway staff. Police opened fire at
Bhayandar to quell angry mobs, and used batons elsewhere to try to maintain
order. Police said at least 70 buses were damaged, while 10 carriages of a
train were set ablaze. Passengers pulled out the seats from another train
and made them into a bonfire.
More than 500 suburban trains were cancelled because of the day-long
violence. Hundreds of commuters squatted on the tracks blocking trains into
the evening. Railway staff said train services would be disrupted for at
least 48 hours because of the violence and damage. It was the fourth time
since July that violent commuters had attacked railway property following
the disruption of services. Bombay's suburban railways carry more than three
million commuters a day into the banking and commercial centre.

<TEXT>
Denmark's gross domestic product increased by 5.7 per cent in the second
quarter against the same period last year, taking the growth rate for the
first half year to 5.4 per cent (in constant prices), according to the
official Statistical Office. The first half recovery was led by consumer
demand, which soared by 8.1 per cent compared with last year. Exports grew
by 6.8 per cent, with second-quarter exports up by 9.6 per cent. Gross fixed
investment increased by 3.2 per cent.
The rapid increase in demand generated strong import growth, with imports up
by 13.6 per cent in the first half and by 17 per cent in the second. The
Danish recovery is supported by strong demand for exports, but it was also
stimulated by a major boost to domestic demand from government fiscal policy
last year. Widespread conversion of mortgage loans from high coupon to low
coupon bonds last autumn and in the spring also made a significant
contribution to consumer spending by reducing the cost of servicing
mortgages.

Differences over licensing policy inside Poland's TV and Radio Council, a
regulatory body, are delaying plans by Canal Plus, the French pay television
channel, to go on the air. The French company, which has invested Dollars 4m
in Poland and plans to invest another Dollars 36m, called on the council's
new chairman Mr Janusz Zaorski to grant the licence promised last summer.
The delay in signing the licence has given rise to fears that Mr Zaorski
plans to grant the frequencies to another operator such as the Italian-owned
Polonia network which failed to win a licence in the original contest but is
held in higher regard by President Lech Walesa, who appointed Mr Zaorski.
Canal Plus is also under pressure from Multichoice, owned by Mr Rupert
Murdoch's News Data Corporation, which is marketing a pay TV service
subtitled in Polish. Multichoice is also offering coded satellite channels
like Filmnet and Discovery but has not gone through the expensive and
time-consuming licensing procedures completed by Canal Plus. The French
company yesterday called on the Radio and TV Council, to examine the
legality of Multichoice's operations which threaten its profitability.

United Nations troops yesterday drove Moslem forces from the Sarajevo
demilitarised zone at gunpoint after Bosnian Serbs threatened revenge for a
commando raid in which 20 Serb soldiers and women nurses were killed.
Peacekeepers said they had evicted at least 550 men of the Moslem-led
Bosnian government army from the Mount Igman area of the zone and destroyed
their bunkers and trenches.
UN commanders feared the Moslem attack, launched from the DMZ against a
Bosnian Serb army command post, would wreck their efforts to lift a Serb
blockade of aid for civilians. Angry Serb leaders had warned they might
order UN peacekeepers off their territory, but the first UN aid flight to
the city for 15 days touched down safely yesterday morning. The operation to
flush the Moslems out of the DMZ, begun on Thursday and continued overnight,
was to pre-empt any attempt by the Serbs to do the job themselves. UN envoy
Yasushi Akashi made clear to the Moslems he would order Nato air strikes
against them if they refused to obey.

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Berlusconi government is urgently studying ways to reformulate its 1995
budget after its rejection by the senate. The search for a new formula
followed a surprise vote in on Thursday rejecting plans to raise L5,000bn
(Pounds 2bn) from an amnesty on buildings constructed without proper
permits. The funds would be raised through charging registration fees for
regularising property development and construction carried out without
permits since 1985.
Along with a further L10,000bn due from a pardon on disputed tax
assessments, the two items were the main source of new revenues in the 1995
budget. Overall the budget, which began its path through parliament this
week, is due to find L50,000bn in fresh revenues and spending cuts to reduce
the public sector deficit to below 8.5 per cent of GDP.
The illegal construction amnesty has been hotly contested by the opposition,
especially the Greens. Also at least five regional administrations have
filed suits with the constitutional court seeking to block the measure which
is seen as condoning uncontrolled speculative building. In the senate, where
the right wing coalition lacks a majority, the government was handicapped by
several absences. The vote was lost by 113 to 115. The government has
pledged to devise a means of re-introducing the legislation; but finding the
necessary consensus in the senate may prove difficult. Mr Lamberto Dini, the
treasury minister, warned this week that in the event of revenue shortfalls,
the government would have to resort to extra taxes.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan's monetary authorities yesterday launched an investigation into the
extent of financial institutions' exposure to the Hualon group, a textile
conglomerate, in the wake of the country's worst stock market crisis in two
years.
Four of the group's executives were detained on Thursday as they tried to
leave the country after payments defaults triggered when underground
financiers called in loans. Another was detained later.
They are being held under suspicion of violating article 155 of the
Securities and Exchange Act, which prohibits direct or indirect manipulation
of share prices. The maximum sentence is seven years in prison or a TDollars
750,000 fine.
Relative calm returned to the market, which fell by more than 4 per cent on
Thursday. Mr Oung Ta-ming, a Taiwanese legislator and Hualon's
behind-the-scenes head, conceded he was not entirely blameless but said he
could do nothing to resolve the matter until Ms Li Hsiu-fen, his top aide
and manager of his share trading activities and one of the executives who
has been detained, was released from detention to help clarify matters.
Mr Oung enjoys virtual immunity from prosecution as a lawmaker. He launched
his political career with his election to Taiwan's Legislative Yuan shortly
after a similar share payments crisis in 1992 to which he was also linked.
The Securities and Exchange Commission said yesterday defaults had been
staunched at TDollars 7.6bn. Mr Day Linin, SEC chairman, said the incident,
which sparked a share index dive of more than 7 per cent in two sessions,
had been contained and would not precipitate instability.
According to figures from the Central Bank of China, outstanding loans to
Hualon's five listed companies alone amounted to at least TDollars 28bn at
the end of August, newspapers reported.
Loans from banks, bills finance companies and other formal financial
entities to Hualon-Teijran were reported to total more than TDollars 10bn.
Central bank officials could not be reached for comment.
Brokers said it was impossible to estimate the group's borrowings from
underground financiers. Market sources estimated Mr Oung has TDollars 4bn in
cash on hand.
Taiwan banks generally lend on the basis of full security, mostly in the
form of real estate or equipment, but sometimes they hold securities as
collateral.
Market sources said some banks refused to lend to entities affiliated to the
Hualon group following a similar share payments default crisis in autumn
1992. That resulted in default totalling TDollars 9.2bn.
As well as being one of Taiwan's wealthiest men, Mr Oung is a powerful
politician. He controls the parliament's finance committee and is said to
have his own faction of a dozen or more legislators in the 161-seat
legislature.
He is an enigmatic character who sports a scraggly beard, dresses sloppily
and is renowned for his retinue of attractive young women. 'Oung Ta-ming is
very mysterious; you can't try to understand him using normal logic,' said a
Taiwanese investment banking source.
The analyst suggested that with Taiwan's closely-knit business and politics,
there was likely to be more to the situation than met the eye. 'Anything
related to politics here is not so simple - you can't just add one and one
and come up with two,' he said.
Hit by a global slump in the textile industry, Hualon-Teijran Corp posted
net losses of TDollars 384mn (USDollars 14.2mn) in 1993, the fourth
consecutive year in the red.
The company forecasts a profit of TDollars 968mn (USDollars 35.85mn) in
1994. One of Taiwan's biggest textile companies, Hualon-Teijran's total
assets stood at USDollars 1.7bn at the end of 1993. Total group assets are
estimated at USDollars 2.5bn.
Mr Lin Chen-kuo, the finance minister, said those responsible for the
defaults crisis would be brought to justice.

FT  08 OCT 94 / German Elections: Poll onslaught bemuses Leipzig
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LEIPZIG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Five years ago tomorrow, some 70,000 people of Leipzig took to their grimy
city's streets in open defiance of a massive deployment of riot police, army
and militia, to demand reform, democracy and civil rights.
'We are the people]' was their cry, in a confrontation with the authorities
which they feared would become another Tiananmen Square. Against all the
odds, it ended without bloodshed. It was an heroic anti-climax which opened
the door for East Germany's peaceful revolution.
This week, they have been finding out just what they were prepared to lay
down their lives for: the full force of parliamentary elections, west
German-style. And the people of Leipzig are clearly a little baffled by the
experience.
First came Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the man who seized the opportunity for
German unification after those extraordinary events of 1989. He called for
their thanks, their loyalty and their votes for his Christian Democratic
Union (CDU) on a cold, rain-soaked evening in what used to be Karl Marx
Square.
And then in strode Mr Rudolf Scharping, his arch-rival from the Social
Democratic Party (SPD), to preach a different gospel on the old Market
Square in front of Leipzig's restored medieval town hall: that the 'unity
chancellor' had got it wrong, that he was to blame for their job losses,
their bitter unemployment and soaring rents. They should vote, instead, for
a change, he said.
The crowds are a sharp contrast to the massive rallies which marked the
peaceful revolution. Back in 1990, Mr Kohl pulled in an estimated 300,000 on
the renamed Augustus square, in front of the city opera. Last week, the
figure could not have been much more than 3,000, including a raucous knot of
jobless demonstrators, who braved a squally night to hear his speech.
The city of Leipzig is already a dramatically different place to the one
which saw those Monday demonstrations in October and November, 1989,
spilling out from the prayer sessions in the Nikolai church, under the
shadow of Karl Marx University.
Western stores, sleek shoe shops and bustling supermarkets dominate the
cleaned up streets of the city centre, cranes swing on all sides over the
skyline, and fast food from Movenpick and McDonalds has replaced the soggy
fare from half-empty state restaurants.
There is still a slightly scuffed and hang - dog look to the passing
pedestrians, still sporting cheap, colourless clothes left over from the old
regime. But no one is too scared to shout their protests at the
disappointments of unification, or even sling a solitary egg at a poster of
the chancellor.
They carried crosses for each local factory which has been forced to close
in the harsh privatisation process which followed economic and monetary
union between the two halves of Germany, and countered the loyalists' chant
of 'Helmut] Helmut]' with a barrage of whistles and cries of 'Kohl must
go]'.
The chancellor was unmoved. He looms over the microphone under a massive
party slogan - 'Vote CDU to make sure it goes on getting better' - and
bellows his message through loudspeakers - 'I am the man who brought you
unification. Vote me.'
Most of his speech is pure history: recounting those heady days when he
thrashed out the deal with President Mikhail Gorbachev, which set the seal
on German unity. This is Kohl the statesman, the man of history, the man
they owe.
He rounds on the demonstrators with a fury which suggests that he cannot
understand their ingratitude: they are the communists who, with the Nazis,
brought down the democracy of the Weimar republic, he declares. They are the
ones who would do it again. And he castigates the Social Democrats for any
hint that they might be prepared to use communist support to defeat his
coalition government in Bonn.
Mr Scharping is another animal. He is full of facts and figures, of jobs
lost and policies mishandled. His rival promised that unification would be
all but painless, and he lied, he says.
He reels off all the tax rises, the soaring rents and prices, the
unemployment and the squeeze on social spending. He promises more social
justice, and more cash payments for children, as well as a fairer
distribution of the tax burden.
It is all a bit lost on his audience, until he comes to questions of
housing, rents and property. That is what they understand: the uncertainty
of living in homes which might suddenly be sold, and the shock of paying
western rents on eastern wages.
Mr Scharping says he will freeze the rents, and ensure that former property
owners get compensation, not restitution.
'I like what he is saying,' says a severe-looking middle-aged lady in a
yellow overcoat. 'But I'm not sure he can deliver it.'
A grim-faced worker is quite sure where his vote does not lie: 'That Kohl is
shameless,' he insists. 'I'm 59 and unemployed. He cost me my job.'
But the electors of Leipzig are learning fast. 'That's all electioneering,'
says a leather-jacketed motor mechanic, highly suspicious at being
questioned for his views. 'You've got to take it with a pinch of salt. I'm
just happy that I've got a job.'

FT  08 OCT 94 / Madrid may inject cash into Iberia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In the wake of the European Commission's controversial decision allowing the
French government to provide fresh subsidies to Air France, the Spanish
government is expected to request similar authorisation before the end of
the year for Iberia, its financially crippled airline.
Iberia is expected to lose Pta44bn (Dollars 343.7m) this year, up on earlier
estimates of Pta30bn, and its accumulated losses by December will have
effectively wiped out a Pta120bn capital injection authorised by Brussels in
1992 on condition that no more public money be made available until 1996.
The request to allow immediate additional funds for the state-owned carrier,
likely to total at least another Pta120bn, will be accompanied by a drastic
cost-cutting programme. Iberia plans to lower salaries by an average 15 per
cent over two years and to shed 2,120 jobs from its 24,456 labour force.
The cuts, which form the basis of talks with the airline's unions over the
next two weeks, are viewed as a test case for the government's declared
policy of substantially reducing losses in the public sector. Yesterday the
unions said they would not begin to negotiate the proposed cuts unless there
was a shake up of Iberia's senior management.
The heavy losses are likely to prompt the removal of Mr Juan Saenz who was
appointed Iberia's managing director in September last year. A plan drawn up
by Mr Saenz to segment Iberia's business by hiving off its maintenance,
handling and systems units to other companies, was shelved in May after
union opposition.
Responsibility for Iberia's critical balance sheet could extend right up to
Mr Javier Salas, the chairman of both INI, the public sector holding company
which is the airline's sole shareholder, and, since September 1993, also of
Iberia.
The government is seriously worried that the airline is draining the
resources of profitable INI companies such as Endesa, the partially
privatised electricity utility.
Iberia could show a small operating profit this year, but its balance sheet
is heavily burdened by its fleet renewal and expansion in Latin America
where it owns 85 per cent of Aerolineas Argentinas, and has substantial
shareholdings in Chile's Ladeco and in Venezuela's Visa.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Spirit of politics takes its toll on Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The official Russian news agency, Itar Tass, yesterday published excerpts
from a letter from President Boris Yeltsin to Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish
prime minister, which express the president's 'sincere regret' for the
'annoying misunderstanding' which kept him inside his jet at Shannon airport
on his way back from the US a week ago, instead of attending a scheduled
meeting with the prime minister.
Mr Reynolds, with great good humour, accepted the explanation given to him
by Mr Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister, that Mr Yeltsin was
'unwell' and 'fatigued'.
Mr Patrick McCabe, Irish ambassador to Moscow, said yesterday the letter,
sent on Tuesday, was 'warm and gracious': it repeats an already-issued
invitation to Mr Reynolds to visit Moscow next year, and looks forward to a
meeting at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in Budapest
in December.
It could not have escaped the attention of the Irish, however, that Mr
Yeltsin said he was not unwell when he returned to Moscow, proffering
instead the explanation that his security people had not allowed him to be
woken and that he was annoyed about it, an explanation the letter seems to
implicitly endorse.
The Irish snub completed a troika of such events. Last month, Mr Yeltsin
seized a baton from a band leader, sang loudly and stumbled at a reception
at the Berlin ceremony marking withdrawal of Russian troops. In Washington
last week he gave a boisterous press conference after talks with President
Bill Clinton.
These have embedded themselves in the Russian political landscape, and, as
the political season opens once more, the president's behaviour and habits
will not be off-limits.
They have not so far, however, come under the sustained attack which a
western head of state would certainly have had to suffer. Mr Victor
Ilyukhin, communist deputy who referred on Wednesday to Mr Yeltsin's
escapades as 'our shame' and claimed he was a long-term sufferer from
alcoholism, was a rare exception to official silence, or indifference.
The incidents, and Mr Yeltsin's general behaviour come up in ordinary
conversation, but are shrugged off, as if to say: 'What would you expect?'
The official Communist party disapprobation of drunkenness, which reached a
peak when Mr Mikhail Gorbachev come to power in 1985 and banned drinking,
has wholly gone.
It had anyway been, in the latter part of the Soviet period, largely
hypocritical: Mr William Pokhlebkin, whose 'History of Vodka' appeared three
years ago, says that, in the 1970s, 'it was no longer possible to evoke a
popular contempt for drunkenness, to create an attitude of disdain for
drunkards, since heavy drinking had lost its stamp as a grave offence
incompatible with the Soviet system'.
Now, alcohol is indispensably compatible with the good life, or efforts to
simulate it. Most of the street kiosks sell alcohol of varying sorts. It is
available in large quantities at official, as well as private, receptions.
Mr Genady Zyuganov, the increasingly militant leader of the Communist party,
said yesterday that the opposition would be out in force next week to debate
parliament's relations with the president. The communists have shown that
they have no inhibitions about attacking Mr Yeltsin for his alleged drinking
habits: the issue will come up again, and, if the allegations have a basis,
then Mr Yeltsin, his health uncertain, is in poorer and poorer shape to
withstand the attacks.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Kohl sows confusion over retirement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday spread confusion over his plans for
eventual retirement, saying he intends to stay in office for the next four
years - if he wins the election - but leaving a question-mark over what will
happen then, writes Quentin Peel.
In a masterly piece of electoral mystification, Mr Kohl rejected any
suggestion that he might quit sooner, but declared that he would be
satisfied with a period in office until 1998.
'If I am given the opportunity and the health to be chancellor for another
four years, this will be a big enough achievement,' he said.
Suggestions in a recent television interview that he would still be
chancellor after the year 2000, when he will be 70, he described as 'weird'.
But he still gave nothing away.
Appearing at the last major press conference of his election campaign before
the poll on October 16, he stressed his determination to see his two great
projects accomplished -German unification and European unification.
The latter meant that the forthcoming inter-governmental conference of EU
member states, in 1996, must make further big strides towards integration,
including a significant boost in the role of the European parliament.
'This conference must bring us an important step further,' he said. As for
the enlargement of the EU, he called for a firm timetable to be set for the
admission of the new democracies of central and eastern Europe.
He repeated his determination that 'the eastern border of Germany cannot be
allowed to remain the eastern border of the EU.'

FT  08 OCT 94 / Discord on rouble's fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russian ministers yesterday gave sharply different accounts of the rouble's
rapid fall, reflecting fear in government circles over Russia's reform
course, writes John Lloyd. Mr Sergei Dubinin, acting finance minister, said
the fall was 'profiteering, pure and simple' by commercial banks, and that
the rouble would rise again soon. But Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime
minister in charge of privatisation, told regional presidential
representatives the fall was a 'result of half measures and deviation from
the financial policy'.
