Mr Ingvar Carlsson, Sweden's new Social Democratic prime minister, yesterday
called in a group of the country's top business leaders to advise him on
industrial policy, including three executives who launched a thinly-veiled
attack on Social Democratic policies during the general election campaign.
Mr Carlsson, who officially assumed office yesterday, outlined in his
opening speech to the Riksdag (parliament) his government's policy platform
and said that he was appointing a special industry advisory committee to
support him in his efforts to reduce unemployment, running at around 14 per
cent of the workforce.
The committee is to include Mr Percy Barnevik, chief executive of the
Swiss-Swedish engineering group Asea Brown Boveri, Mr Lars Ramqvist, chief
executive of the telecommunications group Ericsson, Mr Bo Berggren, chairman
of the forestry group Stora, Mr Leif Johansson, chief executive of
Electrolux, and Mr Bert-Olof Svanholm, head of the Swedish division of ABB
and chairman of Volvo.
All five, who will be joined by other senior Swedish business leaders, are
key figures in the Wallenberg family industrial empire. Mr Ramqvist, Mr
Berggren and Mr Svanholm were co-signatories of a newspaper article shortly
before last month's general election which warned of the threat to
investment in Sweden if the new government introduced policies harmful to
industry. They most strongly opposed income tax increases which Social
Democrats are committed to.
Mr Carlsson, saying his top priority was to tackle the budget deficit and
reduce unemployment, said new jobs must come from industry. 'Sweden needs
more companies and more company owners,' he said. 'This requires closer
co-operation between the government and industry. I will personally be
strongly engaged in this work.'
The Social Democrats plan to increase investment incentives and may try to
cut corporate tax. But the new prime minister gave no indication that he
would back down on his election programme of raising marginal income taxes,
wealth and capital taxes and taxes on dividends.
Mr Carlsson said the election plan, which also included spending cuts, and
measures already approved by parliament this year would over the next four
years strengthen the budget by SKr80bn.
Apart from the public finances and unemployment his four other priorities
were to protect and develop the welfare state, increase Sweden's
international engagement, deepen co-operation in Europe and harmonise the
environment and industry.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Treuhand to seek more cuts in steel output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's Treuhand privatisation agency is likely to push for further cuts
in steel capacity in eastern Germany in a bid to persuade the European
Commission to accept the sale of Eko Stahl, the last of the East German
steel mills, to Cockerill-Sambre, the Belgian steel producers.
Mr Hans Schwarz, head of the workers' council at the Hennigsdorf steel mill
in the eastern state of Brandenburg, said the agency might buy back a part
of the mill in order to close down one of the hot-rolling complexes which is
under-utilised.
Hennigsdorf, which is owned by Riva, the Italian privately-owned steel
group, produces about 700,000 tonnes of steel a year, but its capacity could
increase to 1m tonnes when its hot-rolling operation is complete.
The agency's policy could have the affect of keeping overall capacity levels
in eastern Germany down if Cockerill buys Eko Stahl, but could also mean
further job losses in the industry.
Under the terms of the European Union steel levels agreement, Eko Stahl must
not produce more than 900,000 tonnes until 1999, when production can then
rise. Mr Scharwz said the 850-strong work force at Hennigsdorf would be
reduced by nearly a sixth if the plans went ahead.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Sell-off guide hailed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Spanish cabinet yesterday sent to parliament a set of legislative
initiatives governing future privatisations and deregulating the
telecommunications sector, that were hailed as 'revolutionary' by Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez, writes Tom Burns.
The new legal framework for upcoming privatisations establishes a principle
similar to that of the 'golden share' that allows the government an
effective veto over decisions considered to be of strategic interest, that
might in future be taken by formerly state-owned institutions. The framework
sets the stage for large-scale global offerings next year by the energy
group Repsol and by the Argentaria banking corporation, which are both
government-controlled.
The telecommunications initiative establishes guidelines for the total
deregulation of the sector in Spain by 1998 and it includes a new law that
will soon go before parliament setting the terms for the introduction of
cable TV. Mr Gonzalez said the legislative package represented a 'cultural
change' for Spain and a strategic leap forward in its competitiveness.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Clinton sends in warships to warn Iraq off Kuwait
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and Britain dispatched warships to the Gulf yesterday and put forces
on alert after Iraq moved at least 10,000 troops and a large number of tanks
within striking distance of the border with Kuwait.
Warning Baghdad not to be 'misled into repeating the mistakes of the past',
President Bill Clinton said the US had taken 'necessary precautionary
steps'. Iraq should not make the mistake of thinking the US was too involved
in its military mission in Haiti to pay attention to Kuwait, from which
Iraqi troops were expelled by a US-led force after they invaded in 1990.
A US official said Mr Clinton had put 'less than 15,000' troops on alert for
possible duty in Kuwait and ordered four warships carrying 2,000 US Marines
to move north from the southern Gulf. Britain said it was sending HMS
Cornwall, a frigate.
The Pentagon was also sending an aircraft carrier, the USS George
Washington, and two ships equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles to the
region. Up to 12 fully loaded US military cargo ships in the Indian Ocean
and Pacific have been ordered to either move towards Iraq or stand by for
orders.
According to US officials at the United Nations, Iraq could soon have nearly
60,000 troops, equipped with some 700 T-72 tanks and 900 armoured personnel
carriers, near Kuwait.
A Pentagon official said an Iraqi armoured division of about 10,000 troops
with ammunition and supplies had moved from the north 'very close' to the
Kuwait border and another division was *something in here (HP) *
on the move.
'We are robusting our intelligence and reconnaissance assets . . . we see a
full up Republican guard unit very close to the border, a matter of tens of
clicks (kms) . . . their most forward position we've seen,' he said.
Republican Guards, possibly as many as 20,000 troops and 300 tanks, were
said by diplomats in Kuwait to be heading towards the border. Iraqi
divisions are smaller than in many Western armies, where they often comprise
about 12,000 troops, the diplomats said.
Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said the troop movements were 'not
routine and they're not typical of what we've seen in the past, and
therefore they do cause us some concern'.
In a statement carried by the state-run Iraqi News Agency last night,
Baghdad denied the movements were a prelude to an invasion. 'Peace-loving
Iraq . . . has no aggressive intentions,' it said.
Diplomats say Iraq made numerous movements of forces after the Gulf war and
these had been correctly interpreted as political posturing. However, Kuwait
yesterday called an emergency cabinet meeting, called up some army
reservists and requested allied assistance.
British, French and US jets are based at Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, from where
they enforce a 'no-fly' zone in southern Iraq.
In a statement Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence minister, and Mr Douglas
Hurd, foreign secretary, said: 'We view with concern the troop movements in
southern Iraq and the recent hostile statements by Iraq. If Iraq believes
that its threatening behaviour will achieve anything, then it is making a
serious error of judgment.'
The troop movements took place as Iraq sharpened its rhetoric against the UN
embargo on oil exports, imposed after its invasion of Kuwait, warning it
would take unspecified 'measures' against its 'enemies' unless the Security
Council 'immediately' eased the ban.
The Security Council last night held emergency consultations. It is due to
consider a report from Mr Rolf Ekeus, the UN special envoy, next week, on
the readiness of systems for monitoring Iraq's weapons.
Mr Ekeus is expected to declare the monitoring systems virtually in place.
France, Russia and China have said they believe Iraq should next be given a
'probationary period' of six months for monitoring, after which the Security
Council should discuss lifting sanctions. Britain and the US oppose any such
timetable.
Food rations, upon which Iraqis have relied for 60 per cent of their basic
food needs, were recently cut by up to 50 per cent.
Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, yesterday called on the
international community to examine the 'iniquitous and illegitimate
situation' under which he said one or two large major powers were preventing
the lifting of the sanctions.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Surge in UK exports helps trim trade deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's trade position with the rest of the world is improving
significantly as exports surge to meet strong world demand and imports of
consumer goods fall, official figures showed yesterday.
The trend suggests that the nature of the UK recovery is changing, as
export-led growth begins to play a bigger role than consumer spending.
Meanwhile, a continued fall in the trade deficit last month has damped fears
that the upturn might trigger a new balance of payments crisis by sucking in
imports to meet growing demand.
The Central Statistical Office said yesterday the UK trade deficit with the
rest of the world fell to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 704m in July from
Pounds 729m in June.
Measured on a three-monthly basis, seen as a more accurate guide to the
underlying trend, the deficit narrowed to Pounds 2.45bn in the three months
to July. This is the smallest deficit since 1987, barring a temporary low
point three years ago. It compares with a deficit of Pounds 3.48bn in the
same period a year ago.
The CSO said both exports and imports had risen to record levels in July,
although the underlying trend indicated that exports had shown the fastest
growth.
On a three monthly basis, export volumes were 1.5 per cent higher in the
three months to July compared with the previous three months, and 10 per
cent higher than in the same period a year ago. Export values grew slightly
more, indicating that exporters have slightly raised their prices. Import
volumes, by contrast, fell 2 per cent.
The fall surprised the City, in light of earlier fears that rising demand
this year would suck in more imports. But the CSO said the key reason for
the fall had been a 9 per cent quarter-on-quarter drop in the volume of
imported consumer goods. This may reflect slower consumer spending as a
result of recent tax rises. Imports of components grew by 4 per cent,
reflecting the pick-up in UK manufacturing.
The exports trend was flattered by the North Sea sector's performance. It
recorded a Pounds 1.26bn surplus on oil trade. Exports also grew in most
industrial sectors. Finished goods, which account for about half of UK
exports, rose by nearly Pounds 0.5bn in the three months to July, compared
with the previous three months.

FT  08 OCT 94 / End of the road for the man from the Pru: Direct debits to
replace cash on the doorstep
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'man from the Pru', foot-slogging the pavements of Britain's industrial
heartlands collecting monthly cash payments, has yet to hang up his hat for
good. But he will not be taking new business from next year.
Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, closed a chapter in commercial
history yesterday by announcing that from January 1 it will stop selling the
cash collection life insurance and savings products with which it is almost
synonymous.
Mr Jim Sutcliffe, director of the group's home service division, said
existing holders of such 'industrial branch' policies - so called because
they were designed for the expanding industrial classes of the nineteenth
century - would still get their monthly visits.
But for others, direct-debit bank mandate and annual or half-yearly
financial health checks will replace the smart chap from the Pru, who was
always polite and unlike slicker financial advisers from the City. 'It is an
emotional moment when you close the book,' said Mr Sutcliffe.
The Prudential said its decision not only made commercial sense - in the
first half of 1994 industrial branch business accounted for less than 2 per
cent of the Pru's total UK sales - but was good for its clients. Collecting
in person amounts that averaged just Pounds 8 every four weeks was
expensive, eating into the return that investors eventually receive.
More than 90 per cent of its cash collection customers have a bank account,
the Prudential estimates.
Research suggests that contact every six months is sufficient to maintain
customer satisfaction. The Prudential said there would be no redundancies
among its 8,000-strong sales and collection force, which will concentrate on
selling other financial products.
Under 1920s' legislation, agents selling industrial branch policies must
visit at least every two months and initial in a premium book the amount
paid - though these rules are under review by the government.
From next year life insurance companies will have to give more information
on costs and charges, a move expected to make customers more price
sensitive. But other companies offering cash collection argued yesterday
that industrial branch business still made economic sense.
Mr Martin Fox, marketing manager of Pearl Assurance, said his company
believed in 'regular contact, regularly looking after people and we are
opposed to the idea of selling people something and then walking away from
them'.
Liverpool Victoria friendly society, which last year received 58 per cent of
its premium income from industrial branch business, said it was 'committed
to providing the type of business the ordinary working men and women want'.

FT  08 OCT 94 / Tory right seeks urgent tax cuts to counter Blair's appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major was last night facing a strong warning on taxes from the Tory
right, as Labour's successful Blackpool conference closed with an
endorsement of Mr Tony Blair's leadership from Mr John Prescott, his
traditionalist deputy.
With many Tories rattled by the confidence of Mr Blair's performance, the
Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward pressure group was expected to urge the
prime minister to make tax cuts an urgent priority.
The group was also expected to use tomorrow's issue of its Forward magazine
to urge Mr Major to stress in his speech to his party's conference in
Bournemouth on Friday that a Conservative government would never join a
European single currency.
Right-wingers see these steps as vital if the party is to establish 'clear
blue water' between itself and Labour. They will also call for a renewed
offensive on law and order, an issue on which they feel Labour has
successfully eroded the Tories' advantage.
In Blackpool, Mr Prescott tried to bridge divisions over the future of
Labour's commitment to widespread nationalisation.
In a forceful speech designed to undermine Conservative efforts to ridicule
him, he told delegates that Mr Blair was 'a leader with the courage to
lead'.
He said Labour had 'learned its lessons', and promised to consult 'every
region of the land' to build a consensus on modernising the party's aims.
Senior officials said the regional tour would help ease the pain of
transition from the 76-year-old Clause Four commitment to public ownership
to the more limited support for public services favoured by Mr Blair.
But Mr Blair, who heralded the end of the nationalisation commitment on
Tuesday, issued a blunt warning to left-wingers not to exploit the
leadership's narrow defeat on the issue in a debate two days later.
He said two freshly elected leftwing members of the party's ruling national
executive committee would be 'very foolish' if they interpreted their
election as a signal of a swing to the left.
However, the strains at the top of the party were underlined by Mr Larry
Whitty, the outgoing general-secretary, who warned Mr Blair not to ride
roughshod over the party's traditions.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Russia at a crossroads
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia has reached the limits of gradualism. For nine months, Prime Minister
Victor Chernomyrdin and his colleagues have done their best to find a middle
way between economic 'shock therapy' and no treatment at all. But the lesson
of transition elsewhere is that, in the long term, there is no middle way -
only a choice between a Big Bang stabilisation and social and economic
collapse. Unfortunately, there is nothing inevitable about Russia taking the
route of stabilisation. The west may be able to weight the odds in favour of
that option, but ultimately only Russia can decide.
Other post communist states - Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic - have
already passed this turning point. But in Russia, the institutions of a
civil and market society remain precarious. Privatisation, one of the
success stories of the past two years, has helped to produce a new
entrepreneurial spirit in many sectors of the economy. But without
stabilisation and concerted legal reform, the zeal for profit will be more
visible in fraud and organised crime than in the rise of a legitimate
private sector.
Political forces have conspired against a more concerted reform strategy.
The centres of power of the old order are badly damaged, but can still
command large constituencies. Increasingly, Mr Yeltsin himself seems to be
leaning towards the more conservative of his advisers, who are ambivalent
about reform where they are not downright hostile.
Difficult truth
The difficult truth is that the government's very lack of credibility doomed
the gradualist approach from the start. Enterprises have not stopped
borrowing excessively, because they do not expect inflation to stay low. In
an effort to choke such borrowing off, the monetary authorities have had to
impose exceptionally high real rates of interest, which, in turn, trigger
more distress borrowing. As a result, the economy now teeters on a mountain
of inter-enterprise debt. Even previously viable companies are likely to get
sucked into the web, as long as they believe the government will eventually
give in to the demands of indebted competitors.
And over the past few months, the government has begun to do precisely that.
There has been a relaxation of monetary controls, and renewed flows of
credits to state enterprises. The upshot is the weakening of the rouble,
which fell 20 per cent last month, itself a harbinger of renewed inflation.
It is still falling: a further 5 per cent on Wednesday alone.
How should the west respond? Whatever their differences, the IMF and all the
Group of Seven countries must tell Russia that now is the time to make the
decisive leap, and back up the advice with a firm offer of financial support
if they do so. In Madrid this week, US Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen
reiterated what he told Mr Yeltsin during his visit to Washington last
month: that very large sums of aid were available quickly, but 'only to
support reform'.
Active restructuring
This means that, to obtain cash flows of up to Dollars 10bn from the
international financial institutions this year, the Russian government must
commit itself to a further round of credit cuts and much more active
industrial and social restructuring than it has so far attempted. In the
process it will have to tread heavily on interests which have so far been
shaken, but not deeply stirred.
Central to such a strategy will be stable prices. For all their political
attractions, half measures simply cannot deliver stability in the long run.
As Russian ministers know, gradualism allows them to ease their present
burdens, but this only piles up the weight on future ones. Sooner or later,
they would have to demand the kind of sacrifices from their people which
they have not so far had to make.
The better alternative is to make the commitment, now, to a to a fixed
exchange rate, backed by a sizeable western stabilisation fund and adequate
non-inflationary finance to cover the budget for at least a year or two.
Above all, it is critical that the US and other western countries are true
to their word: the fact that Russia has missed past reform opportunities
owes something to western ambivalence. Before the west can help, however,
the Russian government must make a leap of faith.

FT  07 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Scottish rumours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among brewers, Scottish &amp; Newcastle hardened 3 to 482p amid speculation that
the group was in talks to buy the freehold of 320 public houses that it
acquired last year through its purchase of the Chef &amp; Brewer chain from
Grand Metropolitan. The leasehold is currently held by IEL, a joint venture
between Foster's and GrandMet.
Spirits and wines group Grand Metropolitan rose 5 to 403p as several brokers
issued buy recommendations. The list included Goldman Sachs and Kleinwort
Benson, which said: 'The power of the group's cash generation and the
improving quality of profits will increasingly be appreciated as reassurance
builds steadily.'
Eurotunnel stood out among improving transport shares, shedding 5 to 253p as
stories about a large overhang of stock forced sentiment to take a negative
turn.
Bombardier, the Canadian group which has supplied Eurotunnel with rolling
stock and taken shares as payment, is said to be a potential seller of 29m
shares.
With Eurotunnel moving rapidly towards full operational running, sending
more than 100 trains daily under the Channel, the Canadian company has the
option to cash in its stake.
The shares, some 3 per cent of the company's equity, are worth around Pounds
73m.
Confirmation that BSkyB, the satellite television group, hopes to be floated
on the Stock Exchange before the end of the year gave a lift to leading
shareholders.
Much of the news was already in share prices following an authoritative
report in one Sunday newspaper. However, increased expectation that BSkyB
will raise around Pounds 5bn by floating some 20 per cent of its equity
helped Pearson, which holds 17.5 per cent, move ahead 8 to 590p, and
Granada, with 13.5 per cent, close steady at 490 1/2 p. News Corp, the 50
per cent stakeholder, held at 229p.
BSkyB has appointed Goldman Sachs and Lazard Brothers as joint advisers and
co-sponsors of the potential offering.
Appreciation of the Reed Elsevier purchase of Mead Corp's legal information
arm saw Reed shares advance 21 to 761p. Among brokers who disseminated their
views on the Pounds 950m deal, SG Warburg argued that it would enhance
earnings for the Anglo/Dutch group by 4 per cent in 1995.
BAT Industries rose 7 to 424p, with agency broker James Capel said to have
reiterated its positive stance.
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome gained 18 at 670p as it announced that
Valtrex, a new anti-viral drug being developed for the treatment of herpes,
had shown 'remarkable efficacy' when used to treat shingles. The shares were
also helped by US buying, as was Zeneca, up 10 at 809p.
Chemicals group Laporte put on 5 at 694p as dealers said SG Warburg had
shifted its stance from 'sell' to 'buy'. The house chemicals analyst was
unavailable for comment.
A better than expected 6.5 per cent improvement in new UK car registrations
in September - taking the nine-month rise to 9.4 per cent - helped to push
the motor sector higher.
The news followed on from a September registration gain of 27 per cent in
Spain and nearly 10 per cent in France. Among component suppliers, GKN rose
3 to 598p.
Rolls-Royce saw 7m shares traded and ended 4 higher at 175p. Motor
distributors were also firm, notably Lex Service, which put on 7 at 353p.
Inchcape added 8 at 418p.
A 3.1m block of shares in FR Group - 4 per cent of its equity - was placed
at 271p, a substantial discount to the underlying market. On 6.8m volume,
the busiest day ever for FR, the shares dipped 3 to 278p.
GEC gained 5 at 288p as Hoare Govett improved its recommendation and
emphasised the company's defensive qualities in the event of a US rate rise.
Electricity groups Southern and Yorkshire were casualties in an otherwise
steady sector, with dealers disappointed that the companies have not yet
moved to buy in their own shares ahead of their closed periods. Yorkshire's
closed period begins today, while Southern's starts on Thursday. The latter
lost 11 at 715p and the former 11 1/2 at 694p.
US buying lifted British Petroleum 4 to 406 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 10m
shares.
Retailing group Etam tumbled 21 to 282p after the company said sales in the
first few weeks of the second half of the year were below expectations.
High street retailer Marks and Spencer appreciated 9 to 402p in active
trading of 5.4m after James Capel was said to have upgraded profits
expectations and reiterated its buy stance on the shares. Kleinwort Benson
was also said to favour the stock. A positive recommendation from Cazenove
was said to have boosted Burton Group, which finished the session 2 1/2
ahead at 62p.
The market continued to look favourably on Storehouse following Wednesday's
positive trading statement. The shares appreciated 7 to 205p.
There was plenty of action in the banks sector, where National Westminster
responded to aggressive US buying interest, ending 6 higher at 478p and
shrugging off talk of a profits downgrade by James Capel, the influential
agency broking house.
Capel also lowered its forecasts for HSBC and Barclays, dealers said. The
latter made a poor showing, sharply underperforming the FT-SE 100 Index and
finishing a penny off at 550p. HSBC managed a 7 gain at 676p.
The two Scottish banks also suffered, Bank of Scotland easing 3 to 193p,
still reflecting disappointment with its interim dividend and following
comment on the results.
United Friendly 'B' stood out in life assurances, racing up 20 to 480p.

FT  07 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: BT firm ahead of figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A shift to perceived high quality defensive stocks continued yesterday, with
BT once again high on the buying list of institutions seeking good yields
and strong potential dividend growth against the market.
BT shares settled 8 1/2 firmer at 372 1/2 p on relatively high turnover of
15m as more telecoms analysts appreciated the company's fundamental
strengths, and following a series of meetings with the telecoms giant. Much
of the buying interest was said to have emanated from the US.
The company is scheduled to announce second-quarter figures on November 10,
with analysts looking for pre-tax profits in excess of Pounds 700m, a
dividend increase of 6 per cent-plus and good news on inland call volumes.

FT  07 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bonds lead equities to successful
recovery - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More favourable news on economic progress, reflected in firmer bond prices,
encouraged a rally in the UK stock market yesterday. A steadier opening to
the new session on Wall Street confirmed London's improvement and the FT-SE
100-share Index climbed 28.1 to close at 2,984.4, taking it once again into
what has been seen as a support zone.
However, traders hastened to point out that the real test of the market's
confidence will come this afternoon when the US payroll and unemployment
data will flash across the trading screens.
Equities took their lead early from an improvement in British government
bonds, which had stood up better to the shocks that upset equities in the
previous session. Stock index futures were also in a more positive mode.
The rally was extended on the news that UK manufacturing output had dipped
by 0.3 per cent in August, a welcome indication to the equity market of
reduced economic pressure for a further rise in UK base rates. The Footsie
quickly extended its early gain to around 30 points, recapturing the 2,985
area whose loss added to the general woe in the previous session.
Interest then slackened off until Wall Street opened, and even then a dip of
2.69 in the Dow during London hours left the UK market with little to go
for. The Footsie closed just below the day's best and stock index futures
were still at a discount to the fair value premium, which allows for
carrying costs and dividend flow on the shares in the contract.
Trading volume of 579.7m shares through the Seaq network remained moderate,
compared with 517.1m on Wednesday, when retail business was worth a
respectable Pounds 1.41bn.
Some trading houses claimed to have scented a more optimistic mood in New
York ahead of today's publication of the September payroll figures. There
was no wish to take large share positions, and traders remained very wary of
the savage falls recorded in the market this week. However, suggestions that
some marketmakers had been seriously hurt were believed to be exaggerated.
Market strategists have been favourably impressed by the relative steadiness
in bonds this week and believe that this may be laying the foundations for a
genuine recovery in the stock market. However, the renewed optimism towards
base rate prospects which followed release yesterday of the August
manufacturing output data would be unlikely to survive any negative news on
employment numbers from the US today.
Most of the gains in share prices yesterday could be ascribed purely to
technical recovery from the setback on Wednesday. Marketmaking firms were
content to mark prices higher on fairly thin demand, but were not actively
in search of stock.
Views on prospects for the London market towards the end of the year
remained very mixed. Some chartists warned that if the Footsie proves unable
to hold at its present levels, it could find itself unsupported - 'right
down to 2,200,' according to one of the more pessimistic commentators.
However, the market appeared significantly more calm at last night's close
and traders hoped that if today's US data can be taken aboard safely, then a
more genuine recovery in share prices may set in.
Flemings, the London-based securities house, believes that, provided that
base rates remain unchanged until the new year and the November Budget
reveals significant reductions in spending programmes, then the end of
December could bring a rally in both equities and government bonds. But it
expects consumer spending power to remain squeezed, with margin stagnation
continuing to be a problem for many leading UK companies.

FT  07 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Following the improved tone on Wall Street, stock index futures moved
steadily upwards to recover around half of the previous session's savage
losses, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 22 points higher at 2,996 at the
official 4.10pm close, and in later trading it clawed its way back to the
3,000 level.
At the official close the premium to the cash market was 11.6 points, with
the fair value premium standing at 17.5 points.
Traders described the upturn as a technical bounce but said trading
contained a number of more positive points, notably a return of a limited
amount of institutional business.
One trader said there was 'good quality' buying at times during the session.
Institutions have been absent from the stock index futures market for nearly
two months.
Trading volume was relatively low, however, with 12,154 contracts, compared
to 17,815 on Wednesday. The December contract continues to track Wall
Street.
Reduced turnover was also a feature of traded options, with 39,117 lots
dealt, against 46,199 a day earlier. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume accounted
for 25,179 lots.
Glaxo was the the most heavily traded individual stock option with 4,227
contracts. BP and British Airways were also active options.

The Toronto market bucked the trend in New York and posted solid gains in
moderate trading as bargain hunters shrugged off caution ahead of the
release of today's crucial US employment figures.
In spite of a slight decline by bonds, Canadian stocks built on Wednesday's
late rally, taking back some of the losses from the previous two days of
trading that shaved more than 90 points off the TSE 300 composite index.
The TSE 300 finished 22.96 points up at 4,276.32, while rises led declines
by 367 to 350 after volume of 60.3m shares valued at CDollars 889m.
Thirteen of the 14 sub-indices were up, with real estate, golds,
transportation and financial services leading the way. The paper and
forestry sector posted a decline.

FT  07 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow softens ahead of crucial
jobs data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices gave ground for the third session in a row yesterday as
equity investors braced themselves for today's crucial jobs data, writes
Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 11.78 lower at 3,775.56, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.16 to 452.36. The Nasdaq
composite receded 2.09 to 744.19 but the American SE composite bucked the
trend, gaining 2.49 at 453.60.
On the New York SE, declining issues outpaced advances by a slim margin
after moderate volume of 271.4m shares.
Stocks opened weaker but limped back to near their starting levels by
mid-morning.
There was no important economic news released, and the bond market was
taking a break after a long spell of turbulence which had driven prices
lower in recent weeks.
But the charged atmosphere was expected to return with a vengeance this
morning. With the Labor Department set to release its monthly report on the
employment market, investors were calculating the odds of the Federal
Reserve responding with a move to lift interest rates again.
Economists were expecting to see an increase in non-farm payrolls of about
250,000. If the gain was close to 300,000 - a figure which would indic-ate a
spurt of economic act-ivity - many thought it was likely that the Fed would
act immediately.
During the afternoon, the selling pressure picked up a little pace, pushing
several of the Dow components lower. International Paper retreated Dollars 1
1/8 to Dollars 76 3/8 amid a general downturn in paper and pulp issues.
General Motors dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 43 7/8 , pulling down
Chrysler Dollars 1 to Dollars 44 1/8 and Ford Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 27 1/8
. JP Morgan was off Dollars 1 at Dollars 59 1/4 but Procter &amp; Gamble climbed
Dollars 1 to Dollars 59 7/8 .
The session was enlivened by the announcement of an attempt to derail an
agreed merger between two big railways. Union Pacific weakened Dollars 1 7/8
to Dollars 50 on the disclosure that it had filed a lawsuit seeking to force
Santa Fe Pacific to entertain its rival takeover offer. Santa Fe's share
price added Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 13 3/8 in the wake of the move, while
Burlington Northern, its would-be partner, relinquished Dollars  3/8 to
Dollars 48 7/8 .
Salomon, the Wall Street investment bank, slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 37
7/8 after warning that it would report an after-tax loss of Dollars 100m for
the third quarter.
The market was generally non-plussed by the release of monthly sales data by
the leading retailers, although Kmart receded Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 16 7/8

the company warned of a decline in third-quarter earnings.
On the Nasdaq market, Apple Computer gave back Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 36
1/4 in heavy volume of 4.7m shares. The stock had jumped in the previous
session on speculation that Motorola was interested in acquiring the

FT  07 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses in limited technical
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, did his bit for bourses
yesterday, saying that he saw room for a rebound, writes Our Markets Staff.
At Wednesday's close, the Paris CAC 40 index was at a low for the year, and
down by 20 per cent from its 1994 high, and Mr Alphandery could see no
repeat now of the October 1987 stock market crash.
PARIS bounced a little after Wednesday's 1994 low but it put in less of a
recovery, with the CAC 40 index just 9.66 higher at 1,843.38, than it did
from a similar position on Tuesday. Turnover fell to FFr2.64bn as a
demonstration against the Renault privatisation disrupted trading on the
Matif and Monep exchanges.
Significant moves tended to be downwards. Saint Gobain fell FFr6 to FFr612
as its chairman, Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, was questioned again by a judge
looking into corruption allegations. Bouygues, the construction group whose
consortium won France's third mobile telephone licence this week, fell FFr18
to FFr569 on plans for a rights issue.
M6-Metropole Television, introduced to the market last Thursday, dipped FFr3
to FFr307 after fund managers filled their requirements. Chargeurs, the
textile company, came back FFr29 to FFr1,284 after it said that its stake in
BSkyB would not be materially altered by the flotation of the British
satellite broadcaster.
However, Damart, the thermal clothing supplier, rose FFr290 to FFr6,040
after results which, lacking comparisons due to a change in the year-end,
indicated a 7.1 per cent rise in turnover 'at constant structure' for the
year to June.
FRANKFURT registered a new 1994 closing low on the official session at
1,961.03, down 7.69. But the real measure of the day was in the post bourse
where the Ibis-indicated Dax hit bottom at 1,930.55 on Wednesday, and closed
yesterday 18.92 higher at 1,965.41.
In that period Volkswagen rose DM9 to DM434.30, and foreign interest was
noted. However, turnover fell from DM7.5bn to DM6.4bn and the index reaction
looked strictly technical.
West German industrial orders fell 2.2 per cent in August from July and were
up 6.4 per cent from a year ago. Economists said that the slowdown was not a
danger sign for the economy.
Mr Reinhard Fischer, a partner in Research Vision, was less sanguine in one
sense, saying that, of the building blocks of the economy, neither
consumption nor investment in new equipment were pointing to a robust
recovery yet.
Exports were looking good, he acknowledged, but the weakness of the dollar
put a question mark over profitability in that area. He did say that this
different quality of growth could allow the Bundesbank some leeway to reduce
interest rates further after the German general election.
ZURICH finished slightly firmer on futures-related short-covering after
weaker futures put the market under pressure. The SMI index closed 4.4
higher at 2,484.8, up from an intraday low of 2,473.
Activity focused on insurers, with Swiss Re up SFr23 to SFr688 on foreign
demand in the wake of its announcement of a new corporate strategy and the
sale of its direct insurance businesses.
Second-line insurers benefited from takeover speculation, with Baloise
moving up SFr120 to SFr2,595 and Elvia adding SFr70 at SFr3,620.
Among cylicals, Motor-Columbus jumped SFr170 to SFr1,850 on speculation that
a decision by UBS to sell its stake of more than 50 per cent was imminent.
Holderbank finished SFr3 firmer at SFr953, off a high of SFr970, after Bank
Julius Baer raised its 1994 earnings estimate to SFr63.7 per share from
SFr60 and its 1995 estimate to SFr86.3 a share from SFr75.
MILAN saw a technical rebound after Wednesday's 2.4 per cent fall, and the
Comit index picked up 5.03 to 646.97, bringing a five-day slide to a halt.
However, worries about the continuing row between the government and
anti-corruption magistrates continued to act as a disincentive, particularly
to foreign investors.
Benetton picked up L86 to L19,343 after the 13.1 per cent fall of the
previous four sessions, following last week's disappointing results. Merrill
Lynch reiterated its positive recommendation on the stock, encouraging
investors to exploit the current price weakness and buy. It said that
Benetton remained the only larger apparel retailer with a real global
presence and the company was successfully diversifying and upgrading its
product mix. Its price policy had enabled the company aggressively to
increase market share and there was further room to reduce costs.
AMSTERDAM saw thin, volatile trade which took the AEX index 0.65 higher to
390.78.
VNU dropped Fl 5.10 to Fl 173.50 amid concerns that a new commercial
television station, to be launched in the Netherlands, might put pressure on
the market share of VNU's television affiliates.
Elsevier erased Wednesday's sharp losses in heavy trade, as investors
reversed their negative reaction to the purchase of a US data bank. Elsevier
rose 90 cents or 5.6 per cent to Fl 17, having fallen 3.5 per cent on
Wednesday as dealers expressed doubts over the Dollars 1.5bn it had paid
Mead Corp's Lexis-Nexis operation.
WARSAW's recovery stalled, with the Wig index virtually unchanged at
9,902.4, but the newly listed construction company ESPEBEPE surged 125 per
cent from its issue price to 340,000 zlotys on its first day on the main
market. However, the new issue boosted the company's share capital 10-fold
and it was criticised for advertising, in these circumstances, based on its
historical average price/earnings ratio.

FT  07 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Stora and MoDo

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Stora and MoDo, two of Sweden's leading forestry groups, fell heavily
yesterday on plans for big investments in new capacity, writes Christopher
Brown-Humes in Stockholm.
MoDo, which is considering a SKr2.1bn investment in a 270,000 tonnes per
year newsprint machine at Braviken, saw its 'B' shares weaken SKr16 to
SKr325.
Stora fell SKr9 to SKr417 as it began design work on a new 290,000 tonnes
per year board machine. This investment would cost around SKr2.8bn.
These are the two biggest investment projects to emerge from the Swedish
pulp and paper industry this year.
The market took fright because the severe downturn in the pulp and paper
cycle in 1991 and 1992 was caused by overcapacity, not by a drop in demand.
There are fears that the current upturn could also be wrecked if too many
companies order new equipment. The market is also worried about dividend
prospects and - in MoDo's case - about a possible rights issue.
The forestry index fell 1.73 per cent to 1,424.54, against an overall 0.2
per cent decline in the Stockholm bourse.

Share prices lost ground on small-lot arbitrage selling as public fund
managers, which supported prices on Wednesday, held the sidelines, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average shed 96.32 to 19,655.23 after a day's high of
19,748.45 in the morning and a subsequent low of 19,645.43. Volume was 203m
shares, against 197m. Most investors were reluctant to build positions ahead
of the three-day weekend.
The Topix index of all first section stocks closed 5.78 down at 1,576.27 and
the Nikkei 300 lost 1.09 at 288.80. Falls led gains by 659 to 328, with 191
issues steady. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index improved 2.30 to
1,299.90.
Lingering doubts over Japan Tobacco also weighed on investor confidence.
Although the offer was oversubscribed, successful applicants who won the
lottery for shares might let their applications lapse by not paying for
their JT stock by the deadline next Tuesday.
Some Japanese brokers expect as many as 30 to 40 per cent of the successful
applicants to abstain. Any stock which becomes available as a result of
lapsed applications will be reallocated to applicants rejected in the first
round, and this will be announced next Friday.
The second round applicants have until October 19 to pay, and any left-over
stock as a result of lapsed second-round applications may be offered into
the secondary market by the government on October 27, the listing date.
Japan Telecom, regarded as a benchmark of investor confidence in former
state-owned companies, slipped Y130,000 to Y4.01m. It rallied on Wednesday
on active buying by brokers looking to prop up waning interest in Japan
Tobacco.
In Osaka the OSE average rose 20.81 to 21,990.09 in volume of 8.7m shares.
Roundup
Australia and Hong Kong were inclined to wait for today's US jobs data;
other markets had more parochial considerations.
TAIPEI was sharply lower for a second straight day, losing 4.2 per cent in
active trade as the Hualon Group's payment defaults case continued to
dominate activity.
The weighted index ended 291.27 points down at 6,653.32 in active turnover
of TDollars 70.20bn, having fallen 3.3 per cent on Wednesday.
At least 15 Taiwanese brokerages, including two units owned by Hualon, were
involved in the payment defaults totalling TDollars 2.6bn in the previous
three days, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Hualon Corp
plunged the daily 7 per cent limit for the second day, shedding TDollars 1.7
to TDollars 22.9.
SINGAPORE fell 2.0 per cent, led by losses in blue chips as institutional
investors succumbed to concerns on Wall Street. The Straits Times Industrial
index closed 47.52 points lower at 2,333.31.
Singapore Airline foreign shares dived SDollars 1.30 to SDollars 13.70 on
news that it will cut published fares for 33 destinations.
SHANGHAI's A share index dropped 6.8 per cent amid persistent, renewed
rumours that China's leader Deng Xiaoping was seriously ill. The index gave
up 48.81 at 674.56, falling below support at 700, in reduced turnover of
Yn2.9bn. The B share index, of shares available to foreigners, dipped 1.02
or 1.3 per cent to 78.63.
WELLINGTON continued lower for the third consecutive day, with interest rate
worries leaving shares 1.8 per cent down. The NZSE-40 capital index finished
36.86 weaker at 1,998.16.
SEOUL followed an early spurt in banking and low price/earnings ratio stocks
with broadly based buying, and the composite index moved ahead 12.64 to a
new 1994 high of 1,069.93. In banks, Shinhan climbed Won800 to a record
Won19,800 and Korea Long-Term went the day's limit up, Won1,000, to
Won25,600.
JAKARTA's official index ended 7.82 higher at 511.46 after investors bought
a range of high-capitalisation stocks. BOMBAY saw sustained buying on
expectations of a favourable credit policy being announced on Monday week,
the BSE 30-share index advancing 29.44 to 4,379.49.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Finnish markka firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp upward move in the Finnish markka was the dominant event on the
foreign exchanges yesterday, writes Philip Gawith.
The currency is benefiting from good economic fundamentals, and polling
evidence suggesting that the Finnish electorate will support European Union
membership when it votes next weekend.
The other move of note was a sharp turnround in sentiment in the short
sterling markets. Prices rose after weaker than expected UK manufacturing
and industrial production figures for August suggested no need for a
near-term tightening of monetary policy.
Market activity, however, was generally very muted, with most attention
focused on the release today of the US employment report and the Columbia
University inflation index.
The dollar traded in a narrow range, ending at Y99.75 from Y99.47 and
DM1.5444 from DM1.5426. Sterling also had an uneventful day, with the trade
weighted index finishing unchanged at 80.2. In New York the US currency
closed at Y99.835 and DM1.5440.
The Italian lira had a calmer day after Wednesday's political jitters,
ending at L1,014 from L1,016 against the D-Mark.
The rouble continued its recent slide, trading at Rbs2,833 to the dollar on
the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, from Rbs2,808. A senior central bank
official predicted that the currency could breach the Rbs3,000 level 'long
before the year-end'.
The Finnish markka was again in the spotlight after new EU polls showed an
increasing majority of Finns in favour of the EU. One poll had 48 per cent
of Finns favouring membership.
Mr Niels Christensen, analyst at Technical Data in London, commented: 'The
polls triggered a move from FM3.11 to FM3.0850 (against the D-Mark)
immediately at the opening of the European session. This move was capped by
intervention from the Finnish central bank and the rate moved back to
FM3.09.
'Renewed moves are expected in the next 10 days before the Finnish EU
referendum on October 16. A move through FM3.08 and on toward FM3.05 seems
very likely unless the Finnish central bank intervenes more seriously.'
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said its Finnish
customers reckoned the markka could reach FM3, while he thought it could go
as far as FM2.80, its best level in the last two years. The currency has
risen from around FM3.32 in mid-August.
According to Citibank figures, out of 16 leading currencies, the Finnish
markka performed the best in the period from the start of the year until
September 29. It rose 5.6 per cent against the D-Mark.
Mr MacKinnon said Finland's economic fundamentals were very attractive. 'The
key that is driving this is the very high export receivables Finnish
companies are getting.' Allied to this is a good inflation outlook, and a
strong growth performance, both in 1994 and 1995.
The Finnish markka has pulled other Nordic currencies with it. Yesterday the
Swedish krona finished at SKr4.759 from SKr4.788 per D-Mark, while the
Norwegian krona appreciated to NKr4.356 from NKr4.359.
Mr MacKinnon warned, though, that the size of Sweden's budget deficit - the
structural deficit (which ignores the effect of economic cycles) is
estimated to be 9 per cent - made the Swed-ish currency vulnerable to
depreciation.
Both volume and price movements in the short sterling market were
favourable, especially in the shorter dated contracts. The December contract
traded nearly 44,000 lots to finish at 93.30 from 93.18.
Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at broker GNI, said the improved tone of the
market was a result of the weak economic figures - well below consensus
forecasts - and the market rebounding from an oversold position. He added
that a lot of traders were squeezed out of short positions when prices
started to rise.
Short sterling prices have also benefited from the better performance of
gilts this week. Analysts report portfolio switches from equities to gilts,
while unease about the dollar, and nervousness about the D-Mark ahead of
German elections, has also lent sterling an unusual safe-haven aura.
Although sentiment has improved, the futures prices are still pricing in a
70 basis-point increase in UK rates by December.
In the cash market, the sterling three-month LIBOR rate came back to 6 per
cent from 6 1/16 per cent, after starting the week at 5 7/8 per cent.
In its daily operations the Bank of England provided UK money markets with
Pounds 805m assistance, after declaring a Pounds 900m shortage. Overnight
money traded between 3 3/4 and 5 7/8 per cent.
In the US today, attention will focus as much on the Columbia University
inflation index as the payroll figures. Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
US Federal Reserve, has cited it as an indicator he watches, and last month
it overshadowed the employment report.

FT  07 OCT 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper's continued recovery buoys
base metals - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER prices yesterday continued to claw back the losses recorded in last
week's dramatic Dollars 120 sell-off at the London Metal Exchange and this
spread confidence throughout the market, traders said.
The three months delivery reached Dollars 2,544 before easing when Southern
Peru Copper Corporations's workers ended a strike. Last business was at
Dollars 2,536 a tonne, up Dollars 13 from Wednesday.
Dealers noted that copper's fundamentals were the most promising of the base
metals with a relatively low stocks/consumption ratio.
ALUMINIUM prices were given an early boost by European merchant demand,
which came in when the three months price dipped to Dollars 1,640 a tonne,
and this soon saw the market nudging against Wednesday's resistance around
Dollars 1,650. But again the barrier held and the price drifted back to
Dollars 1,647, up Dollars 7.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK coal undercuts its
competitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD MCCLOSKEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An invitation issued by National Power of the UK for price quotes for
600,000 tonnes of imported coal has produced the least expected result -
most of the tonnage has been won by UK producers.
Except for six vessels ordered from South African producers, who appear to
have priced their coal well below international levels, the bulk of the
tonnage has been awarded either to British Coal or private UK miners.
The UK prices have surprised even the National Power buyers with bids as low
as 85p a gigajoule, compared with over Pounds 1.47 in the British Coal
contracts with the generators.
The success of the new UK coal industry in straight competition with
importers has not been limited to the internal market, however. Two sales
have been made to Finnish buyers, one by a private producer and the other by
British Coal. The British Coal sale, of about 130,000 tonnes from Selby
stocks, while priced at only 55.6p a gigajoule is likely to have been higher
than BC's valuation of its 13m tonne stockpile. The private mine sale - from
Coal Investments' Silverdale and Hem Heath collieries - is priced even lower
and it is difficult to see how it could have brought the operators any
meaningful return.
That the sales have been possible is as much an illustration of the
imagination of the new coal industry as the dearth of coal on international
markets and consequent strengthening of prices. The Finns, in particular,
have been in the market, having been let down badly by both their Russian
and Polish suppliers and are seeking immediate tonnage for delivery ahead of
a rise in carbon taxes in the new year.
Elsewhere contracts been been signed for 1995 that see rise of Dollars 6 a
tonne on 1994 levels. Many expect that in some markets these rise will prove
to be modest. In Denmark, traditionally the graveyard for optimism among
coal salesman, rises from contracts struck this year at around Dollars 20 a
tonne from South Africa to around Dollars 30, FOB Richards Bay, are
expected.
The coal shortage, which affects coking coal as well as steam coal, albeit
to a lesser extent, is unlikely to be cured in the short term. Strong demand
 -in particular from the US, for low sulphur South American coal, and from
Asian power companies with new power plant coming into operation - is not
being matched by new supply. In Asia, too, India is emerging as a
significant and totally expected buyer.
Although it seems likely at the higher international price levels now
emerging that the new British Coal successor companies will be able to dump
their excess stocks into the European market or into National Power, it is
difficult to see it as long-term business. A return of less than 60 pence a
gigajoule at the mine may be welcome as a bit of additional cash flow, but
in terms of continuing business it is simply not viable.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Guatemala says it will continue
EU banana fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Guatemala said yesterday it would step up pressure for the repeal of the
European Union's banana import regime following the European Court's
rejection of a challenge by Germany on Wednesday.
'This action by the court reinforces our resolve to pursue every available
option under international law,' said Mr Claudio Riedel Telge, ambassador in
Brussels.
He said Guatemala was prepared to complain again to the World Trade
Organisation under its strengthened rules on dispute settlement. Two dispute
panels under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have already upheld
complaints about the EU's banana rules.
In March, the European Commission settled the disputes by agreeing to
increase tariff-free import quotas for Latin American bananas to 2.1m
tonnes. But Guatemala refused to accept the settlement, which has not been
formally adopted by the EU council of ministers.
Germany has lodged an additional legal challenge with the European court
disputing the commission's authority to negotiate the deal.

FT  07 OCT 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The wool market this week inclined easier again, but there was variation
between categories. Fine Merinos opened steadily, then prices fell away,
leaving the 19 micron indicator at 1463 cents, compared with 1541 a week ago
and a recent peak of 1620. The overall Eastern states market indicator
closed at 739, compared with 756 a week before and a recent peak of 835c/kg.
New Zealand and South African sales showed a roughly similar pattern. The
market setback is seen as providing a buying opportunity for those with
longer term needs to cover, but little new business appears to have been
attracted so far. Uncertainties related to the wider world economic
situation play a part in buyers' caution.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian oil exports uprated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent Russian oil exports have continued to grow more strongly than
previously forecast, according to the International Energy Agency in Paris.
In its monthly oil market report published yesterday the agency estimated
that August exports from the former Soviet Union were 2.59m barrels a day,
compared with an earlier forecast of 2.32m. September exports are thought to
have declined slightly, to 2.2m b/d.
The IEA also lifted its forecast for fourth quarter Russian exports to 2m
b/d, 100,000 more than its earlier estimate. Winter storms in the Baltic and
the Black Sea often hamper tanker loading operations at that time. But it
expected a slight rise in exports because of low domestic demand, the need
for hard currency and the prospect that joint ventures between western and
Russian oil companies would be more successful in getting export licenses.
The fourth quarter estimate for output from the UK and Norwegian sectors of
the North Sea is also raised to a total of 6m b/d. The continuing surge in
North Sea production is the main factor behind the IEA's forecast that
fourth quarter output from countries outside the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will be 42m b/d, up 1.1m from the third quarter.
It put Opec output at 25m b/d, above its 24.52m b/d ceiling, due largely to
a recovery in Nigeria following the end of the oil workers' strike.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Magma bid wins Peruvian copper
prize
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tintaya, Peru's second biggest copper producer and owner of the country's
highest-grade copper deposits, was sold at a keenly-contested auction in
Lima yesterday. After seven bids were received, Tintaya was knocked down to
Magma Copper of Tucson, Arizona for Dollars 218m plus Dollars 55m in
Peruvian secondary debt paper.
Magma's winning bid was just Dollars 4m ahead of its nearest rival Metall
Mining Corporation of Toronto. The third highest offer of Dollars 191.6m
came from Britain's RTZ. The minimum set by Peru's privatisers was Dollars
60m cash, an investment commitment of Dollars 85m plus a fixed Dollars 55m
in debt paper taken at face value.
Tintaya will be Magma's first operating unit outside the US. Company
representatives at the sale called the mine - at 4,100m above sea level in
the department of Cuzco, some 400 miles south-east of the capital Lima - 'a
wonderful opportunity'. They said the company was 'extremely confident about
operating in Peru'.
The sale of Tintaya marks another milestone in Peru's aggressive
privatisation process. It is the first time debt paper has been used as part
of the purchase price. Under new legislation, bidders may choose between
offering a fixed amount of secondary debt or a cash equivalent. The same
procedure will be followed with next month's sell-off of the Cajamarquilla
zinc refinery.
Tintaya's new owner faces a major investment commitment, which may be well
in excess of the minimum Dollars 85m over five years specified in the
conditions for bidding. Reserves in the main open-pit mine - where ore
averages 2.04 per cent copper - are down below 12m tonnes and will run out
in around three years. Development of as-yet untouched but highly promising
surrounding deposits will be a matter of urgency.
Three of these - Chabuca Este, Chabuca Sur and Coroccohuayco - together have
some 56.5m proven reserves averaging around 2.3 per cent copper, higher than
Tinataya's main mine. In addition, Tintaya has some 10m tonnes of oxide ore
already mined and stockpiled ready for leaching.
The Tintaya processing plant is one of Peru's most modern and most
ecologically sound. Expanded, it could serve other privately-owned mines in
the same area. Water supply is abundant and electricity seems not to be a
problem.
Privatisation should bring happier times for Tintaya. It is often cited as a
choice example of state mismanagement of a prime asset, having posted losses
consistently since coming on stream in 1985, despite being well-designed and
equipped.
Next on Peru's mining privatisation agenda is the zinc refinery of
Cajamarquilla, located in the province of Lima and less than 40km from the
port of Callao. The sale date has been set for November 4 and the
privatisers are asking for Dollars 40m in debt paper and a minimum of
Dollars 120m in cash (Dollars 8m on signature of contract and the remainder
in deferred quotas). There is also an immediate investment commitment of
Dollars 20m.
Cajamarquilla is one of just half a dozen zinc refineries in the Latin
American continent. It was constructed by Sybetra of Belgium at a cost of
Dollars 309m and started operations in 1981. Installed capacity is 101,500
tonnes of refined zinc and under normal conditions the plant produces at
between 90 and 95 per cent of that.
Last year's sales topped Dollars 85m, with zinc ingots accounting for
Dollars 70m. Cajamarquilla also produces up to 180,000 tonnes of sulphuric
acid - which brought in Dollars 4.4m last year.
Fourteen companies have pre-qualified for the purchase, two of them Peruvian
operations that buy zinc for industrial transformation. The front runner
looks to be Canada's Cominco, which has associated with Marubeni of Japan.
There is considerable scope for increasing local zinc refining capacity.
Peru is the world's fourth largest zinc producer behind Canada, the former
Soviet Union and Australia. But only a third of the 600,000 tonnes of
concentrates produced annually in Peru is refined inside the country.
Until recently, unreliable electricity supply made expansion possibilities
remote. Not-infrequent droughts have always meant unavoidable cuts in
production.
But under Peru's new liberal economic regime, privatisation of the energy
sector is already under way. The new owner of Cajamarquilla will be free to
contract electricity supply from either the recently-privatised Lima
distribution system, or directly from a privately-owned and operated
generating plant in the hinterland.
'This will mean a revolution for Cajamarquilla,' said Mr Carlos Malaga, the
refinery's general manager.
After rationalisation, which has halved the workforce from 1990's high of
1,100, Cajamarquilla looks a leaner and more efficient operation. In 1993
production costs were Dollars 712 a tonne, with still-high energy costs. If
zinc prices hold firm, next month should see another successful
privatisation.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries little changed ahead of jobs
data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After three turbulent sessions, the US Treasury market took a breather as
traders awaited this morning's jobs data.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was off 1/32 at
94 7/8 , with the yield rising to 7.944 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was unchanged at 99 19/32 , to yield 6.704 per cent.
With no important economic news on offer, attention turned to today's report
on the labour market last month.
Economists are expecting an increase in non-farm payrolls of about 250,000,
which would suggest moderate growth. An increase that exceeded that level
would probably trigger fresh declines, especially in long-dated bonds,
traders said.
In recent sessions, fixed-rate investors have become concerned that the
Federal Reserve is allowing the economy to grow too fast to contain
inflation. If the payroll increase exceeded 300,000, many are predicting the
Fed would act immediately to put up short-term rates.
Anxieties over the economy's strength and its implications for monetary
policy have upset the market for weeks. Yesterday provided an opportunity to
regroup before a crucial piece of evidence arrived.
A firmer dollar and receding commodity prices provided a calming backdrop,
allowing traders to ignore the release of September sales data from leading
retailers.
Two snapshots on jobs allowed the market to appreciate a little during the
morning.
The Labor Department said initial claims for unemployment benefit had risen
by 7,000 last week and the Conference Board said its 'help-wanted'
advertising index had declined from July to in August, adding that there are
signs the labour market is cooling in the second half.
But there was not enough activity to sustain the upturn and prices quickly
receded.
European government bonds won a small reprieve yesterday, recouping some of
their recent losses in moderate turnover. Weaker-than-expected economic data
in Germany and the UK lent some support, but traders said most of the gains
came from short-covering after Wednesday's sharp sell-off.
They said investors remained reluctant to commit themselves to any new
positions so close to today's keenly awaited US employment numbers, which
many fear could trigger another interest rate increase by the Fed.
UK gilts once again outperformed most of Europe. The December long gilt
future on Liffe rose  21/32 to 99.
Gilts received a boost from lower than expected industrial production and
manufacturing output data, which indicated that the economy is not
overheating and eased fears of inflation and monetary tightening. This
boosted especially the short end of the yield curve, where the December
contract rose by 0.12 to 93.30.
'People realise that even if rates go up, they won't rise as sharply as was
factored in earlier,' said Mr Adrian James, of NatWest Markets.
Gilts gained further support from continued buying by UK pension funds and
some continental investors. The 10-year gilt spread over bunds narrowed
again, to 127 basis points from 133 on Wednesday.
German bunds recovered some of Wednesday's losses, with the December bund
future on Liffe ending about 0.27 points higher on the day. Support came
from news of a 2.2 per cent drop in manufacturing orders for August.
However, with bunds overshadowed by the elections and key US data, dealers
see little scope for clear progress until the second half of the month.
French bonds ended a shortened session slightly higher after dealings were
halted around lunchtime when union workers from French car manufacturer
Renault occupied the trading floor.
Italian bonds bounced back from Wednesday's precipitous fall, with the BTP
future on Liffe rising some 0.54 points to 97.85. However, the market is
likely to remain jittery amid political tensions and uncertainty over the
budget bill's parliamentary approval.

FT  07 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: BZW launches commodities fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays de Zoete Wedd yesterday launched a new commodities investment fund
which it claims is the first fund to be listed on the London Stock Exchange
offering investors access to a wide range of commodities.
The Jersey-based investment fund, which will be managed by BZW Investment
Management (BZWIM), has already attracted Pounds 70m of institutional
interest.
A shelf registration has been filed with the London Stock Exchange putting a
maximum of Pounds 200m on the amount of the fund.
Mr Ronald Gould, the managing director of BZWIM, said that 'despite
difficult general market conditions, there has been widespread global
interest' in the commodities fund 'based on the strong investment outlook
for commodities and their powerful diversification benefits'.
Investor interest in real assets, such as commodities, has been aroused
recently following the strong economic upturn in parts of Europe and the US,
which has caused sharp rises in some commodity prices, coupled with signs of
a resurgence in inflation and rising interest rates. Commodities can be used
as a hedge against inflation and as a play on economic growth.
The minimum investment required by the fund is Pounds 5,000.
The fund was due to be launched in early September. However, unexpectedly
strong interest from Japanese investors prompted a delay in the publication
of the fund's pathfinder prospectus to allow time for it to get clearance
from Japan's ministry of finance. Japanese investors account for around
Pounds 10m of the shares already placed.
The fund will aim to outperform the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index by giving
a greater weighting to industrial materials and energy, which BZW thinks
should benefit the most from stronger economic growth.

FT  07 OCT 94 / International Bonds: Intelsat taps 10-year sector with
cheaply-priced Dollars 200m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few borrowers braved the eurobond market yesterday ahead of today's US
employment data, which could prompt a further rise in US short-term interest
rates. The US dollar sector saw most activity, with deals from Intelsat and
Morgan Guaranty Trust.
Intelsat tapped the longer end of the dollar sector with a 10-year Dollars
200m offering priced to yield 55 basis points over US government bonds.
Syndicate managers described the pricing as cheap and the spread tightened
to around 50 basis points once the bonds were freed to trade. 'These bonds
were priced to clear,' said one trader.
'The market is still difficult but the general feeling is that if you can
pick your spot and price to recognise market conditions then you can get
your deal done,' said another.
Intelsat makes rare appearances in the eurobond markets. In March this year
it brought a 10-year Dollars 200m bond offering, which was priced, launched
and syndicated in Asia Pacific (excluding Japan).
That deal, which was offered at the tighter spread of 37 basis points over
the US Treasury bond, was not seen as a success at the time. It was
important, therefore, that yesterday's deal was a success, syndicate
managers said.
Morgan Guaranty Trust tapped the shorter end of the dollar sector with a
Dollars 200m offering of two-year bonds priced to yield 19 basis points over
US government bonds. Syndicate managers said the bonds were fairly priced.
Lead manager J. P. Morgan said it had sold Dollars 60m of its own allocation
of Dollars 136m and had only taken back Dollars 10m of the Dollars 64m
allocated to other banks.
Demand came from Swiss and Benelux retail investors, and to a lesser extent
from the Middle East and Germany.
Goldman Sachs and CS First Boston have cut 25 basis points from the 40 basis
points launch spread on the Dollars 200m Reed Elsevier five-year bond issued
last month, after news of the company's takeover and possible credit rating
downgrading.
Two deals were launched in the lira sector, despite turbulence resulting
from recent political developments in Italy.
Deutsche Finance Netherlands opted for the two-year maturity with a L200bn
deal offering an 11 per cent coupon. Lead manager Deutsche Bank London
reported very strong demand, sparked by both the high coupon and the short
maturity.
'No one wants to go long in these markets,' said a syndicate official at
Deutsche Bank London.
Deutsche Bank London also lead-managed another lira offering, this time at
the 10-year maturity for KfW, Germany's state-owned development aid bank.
This deal is fungible with an L200bn issue brought earlier this year and was
said by Deutsche to have met with a good response, mostly from German retail
investors who benefit from a tax exemption.
Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilisers, one of India's largest fertiliser
producers, yesterday raised Dollars 55m with an offering of global
depositary receipts, lead-managed by Crosby Securities.
J. K. Corp, the Indian industrial conglomerate, also announced a Dollars 55m
GDR programme, lead-managed by BZW.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The new French government bonds specifically targeted at individual
investors appeared to have proved highly successful yesterday, with the
amount already sold totalling about FFr3.3bn, the Treasury said.
The state announced last month that it aimed to sell nearly FFr20bn over the
next year in OATs - obligations assimilables du tresor.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economics minister, stressed that the aim was to
offer government bonds to a wider audience, in the same way that the public
can subscribe to bonds in many other European countries.
In total, FFr19.42bn in bonds were allocated yesterday with a coupon of 7.5
per cent and due to mature in 2005. Banks are confident they can sell all of
this amount to the public over the coming year, and their pressure triggered
a decision by the government to double the amount offered.
The Treasury said the final details of subscriptions from the public would
be known by October 25.

<TEXT>
Huaneng Power International, a Chinese electricity generating group,
yesterday made the biggest US offering by a Chinese company when it listed
on the New York Stock Exchange following a Dollars 650m initial public
offering of 31.25m American depositary shares at Dollars 20 each.
The issue represents about 25 per cent of the outstanding share capital,
with each ADS representing 40 ordinary shares.
Trading was reported to be heavy at 2.63m ADSs, but the price held at
Dollars 20.
The issue was sold in three tranches, 50 per cent in the US and 25 per cent
each in Asia and the rest of the world.
Lehman Brothers was global co-ordinator of the issue and also lead manager
for each tranche.
This deal follows the first primary listing in New York by a Chinese
company, when Shandong Huaneng Power Development made a Dollars 330m IPO in
August.

CSR, the Australian sugar and building products group, announced yesterday
that it expects to receive a ADollars 100m (USDollars 73.50m) cash transfer
early next year as a result of the surplus in its superannuation fund.
The company said that the fund had an actuarial surplus of ADollars 290m
when it was last valued. Accordingly, after 12 months of negotiation, it has
been decided that CSR will enjoy one third of this; that a further ADollars
100m will be used to improve fund members' benefits; and that the remaining
surplus will stay in the fund 'to maintain a buffer'.
CSR will treat the bonus - on which it will pay tax - as an abnormal item in
its next profit and loss statement.

He has purchased a further 6m shares, to take his total holding to 13.5m.
Historically, Bendigo has been Australia's second most productive field
after Kalgoorlie's 'golden mile', although mining halted in the 1950s.

Burns Philp, the Australian group which has been aggressively expanding its
food ingredients operations recently, yesterday announced that it was
entering a joint venture in Vietnam, to build and operate a yeast and bakery
ingredients factory, writes Nikki Tait.
Its joint venture partner will be Vinasugar, Vietnam's largest sugar
manufacturer. The factory will be based in Dong Nai Province, to the
north-east of Ho Chi Minh City.
The deal requires government approval, but Burns said it was hopeful this
would be granted before the end of 1994.

Poseidon Gold, part of Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon
group, is to recommission the Gecko copper mine at Tennant Creek in the
Northern Territory, writes Nikki Tait.
The mine was put on a care and maintenance basis last year because of the
weak copper price. However, PosGold said yesterday that the recent
improvement in metal prices meant that it had been able to forward-sell
enough copper, gold and currency to ensure the mine's full operational
status to June 1998, based on current reserves.
Production is now due to commence in April next year, after a treatment
plant upgrade.

FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: Brazil holds back from imposing
capital controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior Brazilian central bank official said yesterday that the government
may consider imposing capital controls in some circumstances, but ruled out
Chilean-style restrictions on the exit of capital.
Mr Gustavo Franco, director of international affairs at the central bank,
said the type of capital controls introduced for a period late in 1993 'may
be used again if necessary but we'd rather not need to use them'. These
controls included a tax on some inflows, mainly designed to prevent surges
of short-term capital.
He added that two rules would govern any decisions made on the subject:
Rules should not be changed for decisions taken in the past, but only relate
to future decisions;
Rules should not be introduced that would affect the exit of capital - to do
so would be unfair.
Speculation in Brazilian financial markets that capital controls would be
imposed has been cited as a factor depressing the stock market in recent
days. The fear is that large inflows following the probable victory of Mr
Fernando Henrique Cardoso in Monday's election could damage the
finely-poised anti-inflation strategy by either over-elevating the exchange
rate or by swelling money supply.
Mr Franco said that a path of low-inflationary growth implied two new
elements for the Brazilian economy: a strong exchange rate and current
account deficits, instead of surpluses run over the last decade. A current
account deficit was the corollary of capital inflows the country needed to
tap foreign savings.
In reference to Mexico's high current account deficit, which exceeded 6 per
cent last year, he said: 'There is no point in thinking Brazil is going to
become like Mexico, but there is no point either in becoming mercantilists
and thinking that having a very large trade surplus is good for the
economy.'
He added: 'Appreciating the currency and trade liberalisation are things
that make good economic sense'.
The last stage of the so-called Real plan - the introduction of a new
currency in July - has brought inflation down to about 1 per cent a month in
September from about 45-50 per cent earlier in the year.
'It was a good start, but let's not get the idea that that the whole thing
is finished,' Mr Franco said.
Future growth demanded public savings and that would only, paradoxically,
come with austerity. 'Growth under fiscal discipline and under democracy is
the challenge of the next administration,' he said.
He was speaking at a seminar organised in part by Banco do Brasil, Latin
America's largest bank and part state-owned, which yesterday announced the
opening of a new securities subsidiary in London.
The subsidiary, BB Securities will underwrite, trade and market emerging
market securities. It will aim to raise capital for companies from Brazil
and other South American countries, according to Mr Alcir Calliari, Banco do
Brasil chairman.

FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: Recovery fuelled by rising
demand - South Korea's petrochemicals industry is coming back to life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARA KIM and JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Korean petrochemical companies are recovering from a prolonged slump
due to increased demand abroad and the unexpected shutdown of several
important petrochemical plants around the world.
The improved outlook is in sharp contrast to the bleak situation that South
Korea's eight leading petrochemical firms faced only a year ago.
The industry, which ranks fifth in world production with a 4 per cent global
share, then suffered from excess capacity after the government allowed a
rush of new entries into the then-profitable petrochemical sector in the
1980s.
To make matters worse, the worldwide recession of the early 1990s cut
petrochemical prices and slowed sales for the Korean companies, which also
had to bear heavy debt burdens from the rapid expansion of facilities.
With the government regulating domestic petrochemical prices as part of an
anti-inflation programme, South Korean companies were forced to dump their
products in foreign markets at rates half that of international prices.
'During that period, South Korean petrochemical companies increased their
capacity seven-fold, which disrupted the international price structure,'
said Mr Kim Kyung-tae, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute for
Industry, Economy and Trade (KIET).
As combined losses last year grew to Dollars 1.25bn from Dollars 875m in
1992, petrochemical makers unsuccessfully lobbied the government to permit
them to form a 'recession cartel' that would limit production and set
minimum prices. But companies are now reporting their first growth in profit
for several years. Prices are climbing as a surge in Asian demand coincides
with a cutback in global production caused by the temporary closure of
several naphtha cracking complexes (NCC), which produce the raw material for
petrochemical products.
The production cuts follow recent accidental explosions at Exxon's facility
in Louisiana and Enichem's Prioli plant in Italy, the largest ethylene
producer in Europe.
'There have also been a series of unexpected plant shutdowns throughout
Asia, including Malaysia and Taiwan. A couple of South Korean NCCs have also
been closed this summer for routine repairs, while only 60 per cent of
Japanese NCCs are fully operating now due to a water shortage from the worst
drought in decades,' said an official at Lucky, the petrochemical unit of
the Lucky-Goldstar group.
This has provided an opportunity for South Korean petrochemical companies to
fill growing demand in south-east Asia and China, its main export markets.
Competing exports to the region from the US have fallen as its producers
keep busy meeting rising domestic demand.
There is also strong growth at home as South Korea's leading industries,
which are enjoying an export boom, consume large amounts of petrochemicals
as raw materials for their products.
In the first half of 1994, Lucky reported a 61 per cent increase in net
profits to Won41.9bn (Dollars 52.41m). Yukong, the nation's largest refiner,
had a 22 per cent rise in net earnings to Won37bn, primarily due to the
improved performance of its petrochemical business.
Hanyang Chemicals reported a profit of Won3.5bn for the first half after
losses of Won4.9bn last year. Losses at Honam Petrochemical, a subsidiary of
the Lotte group, shrunk to Won11.1bn from Won35bn a year ago.
'The main reason behind the increased earnings is a sharp rise in the export
prices of petrochemical products,' said Mr Ko Jae-pom, an official at the
ministry of trade, industry and energy.
'Prices of ethylene, a major raw material for downstream petrochemicals,
have soared by 67 per cent from Dollars 295 a tonne in January to Dollars
494 in September, while prices for polypropylene have also jumped to Dollars
895 in September from Dollars 535 in January.'
Although analysts believed that the boom in petrochemical prices would only
be temporary, there is growing optimism that the recovery may last a couple
of years.
'The closed NCCs will not be able to operate until the second or third
quarter of 1995, which should ensure a favourable business climate for the
South Korean petrochemical industry for some time,' said the Lucky official.
Mr Kim Jong-chul, an analyst with BZW Securities in Seoul, predicts that
there will be a continuing shortage of petrochemical supplies for the Asian
market due to the plant shutdowns and lower US exports to the region.
'We also expect a series of additional plant shutdowns to come on stream in
the next couple of years as the producers raise operating rates of their NCC
units, which would inevitably require more preventive and unexpected repair
work,' he said.
'I think that the petrochemical companies may post another year of losses in
1994 or perhaps break even. But next year will show a return to
profitability,' predicted Mr Kim at KIET.
One sign of renewed confidence is that Samsung General Chemicals and several
other petrochemical companies are asking the government for permission to
expand their facilities.
But the ministry of trade and industry, concerned about a possible renewed
threat of overcapacity, is taking a cautious attitude to the requests until
it is convinced that global demand will remain firm.
The ministry, however, agreed this week to allow Samsung to expand its
facilities for the production of styrene monomer, a secondary petrochemical
product, with the understanding that the increased capacity would only be
used for exports.

The system, known as Project A, will allow traders to use the CBoT's
financial futures and options products during the late afternoons when the
exchange's pits are closed.
Initially, Project A trading will be open for two hours, from 2.30pm to
4.30pm local time, bridging the gap between afternoon pit closures and the
start of the CBoT's night floor trading session. Later in the year, the CBoT
hopes to offer overnight trading.

FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: Cut in charges helps Schneider
to 58% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Schneider, the French electrical engineering and construction group,
yesterday announced a 58 per cent jump in net profits for the first half of
the year, to FFr345m (Dollars 65.5m) from FFr218m, and forecast an even
stronger increase for the full year. In 1993, the company posted profits of
FFr405m.
It attributed the increase to improved trading conditions in its main
markets and a 30 per cent reduction in financial charges. Turnover rose 3.6
per cent to FFr27.69bn, although the increase was much stronger in the
company's industrial activities. Operating profits climbed to FFr1.48bn from
FFr1.34bn.
According to Schneider, the first six months brought a strong contribution
from its US activities. However, industrial operations in Canada incurred
losses. In Europe, economic conditions improved, although the French market
remained mediocre and the company incurred exceptional costs from the merger
of its Merlin Guerin and Telemecanique operations.
Schneider's Spie Batignoles division, which includes its construction and
property activities, continued to suffer losses, although the deficit was
reduced during the first half, to FFr59m from FFr70m. The company said the
operating environment remained relatively weak, but that charges from the
division would be lower for the full year than in 1993.
Financial charges were reduced to FFr630m from FFr906m during the first
half. Schneider said the reduction reflected a lower debt burden, resulting
from a capital increase last year and the sale of non-strategic assets.
It said it expected to finalise shortly the creation of a joint company
which pooled its robotic operations with those of AEG of Germany.

FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: NYSE elects Grasso as new
chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The board of the New York Stock Exchange yesterday elected Mr Richard Grasso
as its chairman to succeed Mr William Donaldson, who steps down next May
when his four-year term expires.
The election of the 48-year old Mr Grasso, president and chief operating
officer of the NYSE, marks the first time that a member of the exchange's
staff has ascended to the chairman's office.
In its 202 years, the 'Big Board', as it is known on Wall Street, has always
been run by a prominent figure from stockbroking, business or politics.
Mr Grasso's elevation was confirmed unanimously by the board, which decided
 -for only the second time in the NYSE's history - not to employ a search
committee to find a new chairman.
This decision reflected the belief among exchange insiders that Mr Grasso,
who has worked at the Big Board for 26 years, was the right man for the job.
Mr Grasso lacks the high profile in Washington and the New York financial
community of his predecessors, including Mr Donaldson, who helped found the
broking firm Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette and later worked as an
under-secretary of state for Mr Henry Kissinger in the 1970s.
However, his supporters point out that his knowledge of the exchange's
operations and technology, and his popularity with the Big Board's floor
brokers and traders, make up for any shortage of influence outside the NYSE.
Mr Grasso joined the exchange in 1968 as a listing representative. In the
intervening years, he made steady progress up the ranks, becoming president
and chief operating officer in 1988, and executive vice-chairman in 1991.
Among his most pressing tasks when he assumes the chairmanship on June 1
will be to stem the flow of business away from the Big Board to
screen-based, electronic trading systems and foreign exchanges, and to
attract more listings of non-US companies.
Mr Grasso last night made listing foreign securities on the exchange a
priority once he took office.
He said he hoped to list securities of 60 non-US based companies in 1995.
The exchange is on target for 42 new foreign listings this year.
'The major source of growth for this institution will be in the non-US
arena,' he said.
The exchange could add a total market capitalisation of Dollars 3,450bn if
it were to sign up every foreign company that qualified today.
'Americans are going to continue to diversify their holdings. We have to do
all we can to try to bring non-US companies here,' he said.

FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: Kmart warns of fall in quarterly
earnings

<TEXT>
Shares in Kmart, the troubled US discount store group, fell Dollars 3/8 to
close at Dollars 16 7/8 in New York yesterday after the company warned that
it expected to report a fall in earnings for its third quarter, ending in
October.
If the prediction were fulfilled, it would be the eighth consecutive quarter
in which the company's profits have declined.
Kmart said the main reason for the downturn was weakness in clothing sales.
This was caused by unseasonably warm weather in the last three weeks of
September, which had compared with cooler-than-normal temperatures in the
same period a year earlier.
The company said the result had been to limit comparable store sales
increases in the US to 1.5 per cent in September. A year earlier it reported
a 7.2 per cent increase in same-store sales in the US, producing net income
of Dollars 94m, or 20 cents a share.
Kmart said a weakness in margins on hardline goods would also hit
third-quarter profits. This was caused by a shift in the sales mix towards
promotional items.
The extent of the decline in profits would be influenced significantly by
sales trends and the sales mix this month, which should be more favourable
than in September, Kmart added.
Last month the company announced it was closing 110 of its discount stores,
with the loss of 6,000 jobs, in an attempt to arrest its decline.

<TEXT>
More Canadian insurance firms are in danger of failure following the
collapse of Confederation Life and Sovereign Life, Mr John Palmer, the new
head of the Federal Office of Financial Institutions (OSFI), has warned.
'As restructuring of the industry continues, some institutions will fall by
the wayside,' Mr Palmer told a senate committee probing the collapse of
Confederation Life in August. He urged that the OSFI be given powers to
supervise investment portfolios more closely, to avoid excessive exposure to
property and other large sectors.
He said the OSFI must be able to intervene quickly with independent reviews
of individual firms and their investment and actuarial policies.
However, Mr Palmer brushed aside suggestions from industry leaders that the
federal government set up the equivalent of the Canada Deposit Insurance
Corporation to protect depositors and annuitants of insurance companies
against collapse. CDIC guarantees bank and trust company deposits up to a
maximum CDollars 60,000 (USDollars 44,776).
'The existing life insurance industry protection fund should have access to
greater borrowings, but more reliance on government is not the answer,' said
Mr Palmer.
'All financial institutions and consumers should rely more on market
discipline and not less.'

American Express has confirmed it will undertake a wide-ranging overhaul of
the back-office operations which support its card businesses in the US, in
the process eliminating some 4,000 jobs.
The company also said it expected to cut a further 2,000 jobs by
'streamlining' other support staff throughout its worldwide operations and
at its headquarters.
Most of the cuts, out of a total workforce of 71,000, will come over the
next two years as American Express closes four operating centres in the US.
The closures would be staged to avoid disruption, the financial services
group said. Further streamlining will lead to more cuts 'over the next
several years'.
The changes mark the second round of substantial cost-cutting undertaken by
the company recently. Two years ago, American Express announced plans to axe
4,800 jobs as part of a move to reduce annual expenses by Dollars 1bn a
year. The company said that target had been reached last year.
The switch to fewer operating centres reflects a change in approach as the
financial services group broadens its range of products. At present, its
charge card, corporate card and credit card products are handled in
different centres. Plans to launch another 10-15 products in the next two
years make this fragmentation impractical, the company said.
The continued focus on improved efficiency also reflects growing competition
in the cards business. Although the market is growing strongly, card
companies have suffered from rising interest rates, which have increased
their financing costs, and the launch of a range of new credit cards.
The reorganisation - billed by American Express as a re-engineering of
processes ranging from cardmember acquisition to product development -
follows a study by consultants from Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton into the company's
costs.

Hoechst, the German chem-icals multinational, expects 1994 net profit to be
up 'more than 20 per cent', said Mr Gunter Metz, vice-chairman in charge of
US operations, AP-DJ reports from Mexico City.
'But that's still not enough,' he added, saying the company continued to
have problems worldwide in fibre and polymer sales.
Mr Metz was attending the 50th anniversary of Celanese Mexicana, Hoechst's
Mexican subsidiary.
Hoechst has a 51 per cent participation in Celanese.
He declined to comment on speculation that the company was considering
buying a leading US chemical company.
Hoechst has acknowledged 'holding discussions with several different US
companies', but has refused to comment on rumours of a bid for Marion
Merrell Dow, a unit of Dow Chemical.
Mr Metz did say, however, that Hoechst had aggressive plans to expand its US
business. 'Our position in the North American market isn't a very big one,'
he said. 'We have a target of becoming one of the top three or five'
chemical companies there.

FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: Apple returns to the takeover
limelight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Apple Computer, the personal computer maker, this week again become the
subject of takeover speculation, with talk in the US markets that Motorola,
the communications and semiconductor group, might be preparing a bid.
Although both companies declined comment and several industry observers
expressed scepticism, Apple's share price jumped jumped Dollars 4 1/8 , or
12 per cent, on Wednesday, to close at Dollars 37 7/8 . Yesterday, the price
receded to Dollars 36 3/4 .
This is hardly the first time Apple has been at the centre of takeover
speculation. Three years ago Mr John Sculley, former Apple chairman, tried
to broker a 'merger' with International Business Machines following the
companies' agreement to form a wide-ranging technology alliance, which also
involved Motorola.
AT&amp;T, the telecommunications group, is also reported to have held talks last
year with Apple about a possible takeover.
While there is no hard evidence to support the rumours that Apple is 'in
play', it is increasingly clear that it needs to form new partnerships -
through either alliances or the sale of equity - if it is to maintain its
momentum in the PC market.
Wall Street analysts expect Apple to post strong results over the next two
quarters, with estimates of second-half profits ranging from Dollars 1.10 to
Dollars 1.85 per share, up from 65 cents on an operating basis for the first
half of the year.
But the longer-term outlook for the company is far less promising. Apple's
share of the world PC market has declined over the past two years to about
10 per cent from about 14 per cent.
Apple's 'installed base' of Macintosh computers is about 16m. This is
dwarfed by an installed base of nearly 70m PCs running Microsoft's Windows
software, notes Ms Lucianne Painter, a PC industry analyst at Salomon
Brothers. 'This makes the Windows platform the obvious choice for software
developers to support,' she says. Software programs for Windows PCs
outnumber those for the Macintosh by more than 10 to one, according to Ms
Painter.
Unless Apple can substantially increase the size of the market for Macintosh
applications programs, it runs the risk of losing the vital support of
software developers, narrowing still further the choice of new programs that
users can buy off the shelf.
After years of internal debate, Apple recently announced plans to license
its Macintosh software to other computer makers, so they could produce 'Mac
clones'. The company's goal is to boost market share for computers running
Macintosh software to 20 per cent by the end of the decade.
However, Apple is taking a cautious approach to licensing its software. The
company aims to pick just a handful of licensees which address segments of
the PC market where Apple has little presence. With most large PC makers now
wedded to Microsoft's Windows, it is not clear that Apple will find many
takers for its software.
Yet it urgently needs a partner that can boost the Macintosh share of the PC
market, industry analysts say. Motorola's introduction this week of a range
of computers based on the same PowerPC microprocessor chip used in Apple's
latest products has led some industry observers to speculate that the two
companies would be a good fit.
However, Motorola's computers - which the company aims to sell through third
parties - are not designed to run Apple's software. It seems unlikely,
therefore, that Motorola's plan is to seed the market for Macintosh clones.
Anyone interested in acquiring Apple will need deep pockets. Apple's market
capitalisation, at the current share price, is approximately Dollars 4.3bn,
and analysts speculate that it would sell at a substantial premium.

FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: AEG sees DM90m battery sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AEG, Daimler-Benz's loss-making electrical and electronics subsidiary,
expects annual sales of DM90m (Dollars 58.4m) from a new high-energy battery
when full-scale production starts in 1998.
Mr Frank Dieter Maier, the director responsible for a pilot production
project launched in Berlin yesterday, said the aim was to seize a leading
position in the new market for electrically-powered passenger cars.
AEG aims to sell 15,000 of its sodium/nickel-chloride batteries in 1998,
when laws come into force in California under which 2 per cent of car sales
must be emission-free vehicles.
Full production capacity - on a site yet to be selected - would cost several
hundred million D-marks, Mr Maier said. Capacity of the DM20m pilot project,
set up to perfect automated manufacturing processes, will be 450 batteries a
year.
He said the power units, developed in a joint venture with patent-holder
Anglo American, the South African conglomerate, had three to four times more
capacity than conventional lead-acid batteries, and gave a range of up to
150km in town traffic.
Reviewing the financial situation at AEG, Mr Georg Stockl, chairman, said
turnover had risen 7 per cent to DM6.4bn in the first eight months of the
current year.
However, incoming orders were up only 1 per cent compared with the same
period of 1993.

Microsoft of the US has chosen Olivetti, the troubled Italian computer and
office equipment manufacturer, as its second service and support partner for
desktop systems in Europe.
Earlier this year it said ICL, the UK-based company owned by Fujitsu of
Japan, had been selected as the first of a number of companies able to
provide pan-European support for Microsoft's international customers.
Microsoft has taken a strategic decision to concentrate on software
development, leaving systems integration, consultancy, maintenance and
outsourcing to service partners.
Olivetti's revenues from desktop services amounted to Dollars 1.13bn in
1993, including an Dollars 810m contribution from Europe.

FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: Salomon warns of Dollars 100m
post-tax loss in third term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Salomon said yesterday it would report an after-tax loss of about Dollars
100m for the third quarter because of another poor performance from its Wall
Street securities broking unit, Salomon Brothers. In the same quarter a year
ago, the group earned a profit of Dollars 20m.
It is the second consecutive quarter that Salomon has posted a big loss
because of the sharp downturn in business conditions on Wall Street. Salomon
has always been more vulnerable than most securities firms to volatile
swings in earnings because a large part of its business involves risking the
firm's own capital in the global financial markets.
It was this proprietary trading business which was once again primarily to
blame for the losses, Salomon said. It said it had suffered a loss in its
other activities, due to the general decline in underwriting activity and
securities trading that has affected the whole of Wall Street.
The news prompted Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, to put the bank's
long-term debt rating of A3 under review. A downgrade would rob Salomon of
its single-A standing, potentially adding to its debt costs, since many
investors only buy paper issued by companies rated single-A or higher.
The rating agency added, though, that Salomon's liquidity remained strong
and it was not reviewing the banks short-term credit rating of A2.
Salomon said its client-driven business still performed better than in the
second quarter, when a sharp drop in the value of securities it holds left
the group with a loss of Dollars 204m. The firm said its Phibro oil trading
unit would report a 'modest' pre-tax loss for the July-September period.
In spite of its losses in consecutive quarters, some analysts warned against
taking too negative view of the bank's earnings. The figures reflected
difficult trading conditions, said Mr Michael Flannagan at Lipper
Analytical, adding: 'Over the longer term, Salomon's earning power remains
very much intact.'
The poor results at Salomon are likely to be echoed by other publicly-quoted
Wall Street firms, which are due to release their third-quarter earnings
over the coming weeks.
On Wall Street, Salomon shares fell Dollars  5/8 to close at Dollars 37 7/8.

Pargesa, the Swiss investment group controlled by the Belgian financier Mr
Albert Frere and Canada's Mr Paul Desmarais, reported consolidated net
earnings of SFr104.8m (Dollars 81.80m) in the first half, down 6.6 per cent,
mainly because of the rise of the Swiss franc.
Most of the group's industrial and financial holdings are based in Belgian
and French francs.
Petrofina's contribution was up 36 per cent to BFr5.2bn (Dollars 153m) and
that of the Tractabel utility advanced 2.8 per cent to BFr6.48bn.
The Royale Belge Insurance group raised its contribution 2.9 per cent to
BFr4.58bn while that of Banque Brussels Lambert was up 26 per cent to

operating profits next year, a net profit could not be expected until 1996.
The railways business in particular was suffering from falling prices caused
by over-capacity. It had booked 12 per cent more new orders in the period to
the end of August, but still needed to close one of its four German plants
and reduce its workforce by a third.
Overall order intake rose 1 per cent in the period, confirming the ZVEI
industry association's recent complaint that German electrical and
electronics companies had yet to benefit from the economic recovery.

FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: Telecom Italia to run Pirelli
telecoms
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Telecom Italia, Italy's state-controlled telephone company, is to manage all
national and international telecommunications services at Pirelli, the
Italian industrial group which is one of its main suppliers of cables.
The agreement, announced yesterday, strengthens the ties between the tyre
and cable manufacturer and Telecom Italia.
The companies said the deal would lead to immediate savings at Pirelli.
It is the first such deal struck by Telecom Italia since it was formed
earlier this year from the merger between Italy's main state-owned telecoms
operators. The value of the accord was not disclosed.
Telecom Italia will initially work on a 'virtual private network' linking
Pirelli headquarters in Milan with 90 units around the world, using existing
national telephone systems. Telecom Italia will also build a dedicated
network for Italy, the US, Brazil, Argentina, France, the UK, Spain, Germany
and Switzerland - the nine countries which account for the bulk of Pirelli's
telephone traffic.
Mr Marco Tronchetti Provera, Pirelli's managing director since 1992,
emphasises strong internal communication. The videoconference links he is
putting in place throughout the group, to connect both management and
research units, will now be Telecom Italia's responsibility.
As a customer, Stet, Telecom Italia's state-controlled parent company,
accounts for less than 2 per cent of Pirelli's overall turnover, and between
3.5 per cent and 4 per cent of the group's cable sales. Mr Tronchetti
Provera has said he is eager to collaborate with Stet on the development of
telecoms and multimedia technology worldwide, using, for example, Pirelli's
high-technology fibre-optic cables.
However, Pirelli has denied it plans to take a direct or indirect stake in
Stet in the next phase of privatisation, due next year.

FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: Merger creates fifth largest
Swiss bank

<TEXT>
Banque Cantonale Vaudoise and Credit Foncier Vaudois, both controlled by the
Swiss cantonal government of Vaud, have agreed to merge, creating
Switzerland's fifth largest bank with assets of about SFr30bn (Dollars
23.4bn).
Neither bank is in difficulty, but the Vaud government said the increasingly
competitive Swiss banking environment made the move desirable.
In recent months, the pace of consolidation in the Swiss banking sector has
accelerated with the three big universal banks, Union Bank of Switzerland,
Swiss Bank Corporation and Credit Suisse, each acquiring regional banks.
Two cantonal banks in Geneva have recently merged, and BCV's own assets grew
by a third to SFr18.8bn last year as a result of rescuing the Banque
Vaudoise de Credit, a regional bank, in December.
A large portion of the capital of BCV and CFV is held by the public. The
Vaud government holds 52.3 per cent of the shares of BCV, the larger of the
two and a universal bank, and 47 per cent of CFV, which specialises in
mortgage finance.
The transaction must be approved by the Vaud parliament and completion is
not expected until the end of next year.
BCV said no decision had been made on the terms of the exchange of shares.
The merged bank, which would retain the BCV name, would cut its combined
150-strong branch network in half, causing the loss of 400 of the 2,400
workforce, the bank said.
BCV has begun to expand internationally, opening a representative office in
Singapore together with the Zurcher Kantonal Bank, Switzerland's fourth
largest bank.
OZ, the quoted options subsidiary of Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking group, has
reported a SFr3.3m loss in the third quarter, bringing the loss for the nine
months to SFr12.6m, compared with net income of SFr21m in the first nine
months of last year.
OZ said the weak Swiss stock market made necessary a high level of
depreciation on securities held.

Allianz Holding, the German insurance group, is seeking further foreign
acquisitions, and has a particular interest in the UK life market, according
to Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle, chairman.
The group, which last week announced the purchase for more than SFr5bn
(Dollars 3.9bn) of most of Swiss Reinsurance's direct insurance interests -
its biggest acquisition - also saw possibilities for expansion in Asia and
central and eastern Europe.
It wanted to become stronger in regions where the scale and breadth of its
business were insufficient to ensure competitiveness, growth and stable
earnings, Mr Schulte-Noelle said yesterday.
The opportunity to buy Swiss Re's 60 per cent stake in Elvia, Switzerland's
fifth-largest insurer, had taken Allianz by surprise, but gave it a unique
chance to improve its position in the Swiss market, he added. Switzerland
had been an especially weak spot in the group's make-up, and before its
purchase of 30 per cent in Berner Holding, announced in June, it had a
market share of 1 per cent.
Mr Schulte-Noelle yesterday reassured shareholders at the annual meeting
that Elvia, and Lloyd Adriatico and Vereinte - majority stakes in which will
also pass to Allianz - were profitable. Swiss Re's losses on direct
insurance stemmed mostly from its Spanish subsidiary, he said.
Cornhill, the group's main UK business, had increased its premium income
almost 9 per cent to DM1.4bn (Dollars 900m) in the first half, and expected
to improve annual earnings.
Growth in group-wide premium income had slowed in the period to the end of
June, rising 6.3 per cent to DM8.4bn. However, because the number of claims
had eased 3.3 per cent, and administration costs had been cut, shareholders
could expect an unchanged DM15 dividend for 1994 as long as there were no
natural catastrophes or other 'spectacular claims'.
Storms in Germany this year had cost the group DM70m. Allianz AG, the parent
company, had also paid out DM45m on claims following the California
earthquake this year. This cost US subsidiaries DM107m, Mr Schulte-Noelle
said.
North and South American profits were under pressure from rising interest
rates, although premium income had risen more than 9 per cent in local
currency terms. This translated to a 2.9 per cent increase on conversion to
D-Marks.
About half of US turnover came from life insurance operations, which had
increased their premium income 15 per cent in the first half.
Growth in Europe had been dampened by unfavourable exchange rates. Although
non-German premium turnover rose 4.6 per cent in local currencies, it fell
marginally on conversion to DM8bn.
French operations had suffered a fall in premium income - against the market
trend - and they had been hit by unexpectedly high industrial claims, while
car theft was still a problem. Cost reductions and restructuring had
improved results, but French interests were not expected to return to profit
before 1995.

Constantia Industrieholding, the diversified Austrian packaging and board
group, said net profits jumped 20 per cent in the first half to Sch120m
(Dollars 11m), and forecast a similar rise in the full year.
Turnover of the family-controlled group was up 8.3 per cent to Sch6.5bn.
Constantia said its Iso division, covering building, sports and security
systems, developed well in the first half.
The packaging division enjoyed a pick-up in orders, although raw materials
became more expensive in the second quarter.
Constantia plans to unbundle into two groups in 1995 to improve
transparency.
For every three Constantia shares, investors will receive two shares in the
Iso group and one in the packaging group.

Sogenal stock

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Societe Generale, one of France's largest banks, yesterday announced a
public offer to buy the remaining shares in Sogenal, a regional bank in
which it is the dominant shareholder.
Sogenal's shares were suspended on the Paris bourse yesterday in advance of
the offer, the price of which will be determined in the middle of November.
The offer - which will apply to the 800,000 publicly-held shares - is
expected to be slightly in excess of the FFr127 at which the shares were
trading yesterday before the suspension, after dropping slightly earlier in
the day.
Societe Generale already owns 94.5 per cent of Sogenal, which it set up in
1981.
The banking group said it intended to restrict Sogenal's operations to
private banking, regroup its activities and concentrate on capital markets
activities and links with large companies.
At the end of last month, Societe Generale reported net profits up 3.8 per
cent to FFr2.24bn (Dollars 420m) for the six months to June 30 this year.

FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Building from a local base / A look at
BICC's strategy for winning work in Asia - Tackling Asia's Tigers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few UK companies could have been more relieved by the recent lifting of
Malaysia's controversial ban on public contracts than BICC, the cables and
construction group.
As a result of the ban, BICC's Balfour Beatty construction arm and Trafalgar
House, its consortium partner, failed to win the Pounds 30m project
management contract at the new Kuala Lumpur airport. However, Mr Ian Thomas,
Balfour Beatty's director for international business development, is
confident the company can make up lost ground.
Even with the placing of the Pounds 1bn main terminal contract, there is as
much work again still to be awarded, building everything from the runways to
the control tower, he says. Then there is a planned airport rail link and
other opportunities in Malaysia.
Fortunately for BICC, its other business, cables, was unaffected by the ban.
The UK company has 40 per cent of Power Cables Malaysia, the rest of which
is owned by Bumiputra interests. Mr Roy Allen, responsible for planning how
BICC can develop its cables business in Asia, says: 'It is a model for our
expansion in the region.'
And rapidly industrialising countries, such as Malaysia, remain crucial to
BICC's Asian strategy. Sales in the Asia-Pacific region jumped from Pounds
127m in 1989 to Pounds 281m last year, if all of PCM's Pounds 40m sales are
included.
Mr Thomas believes Balfour Beatty can raise its turnover in the region from
the Pounds 100m to Pounds 110m achieved last year to Pounds 300m over the
next three to five years. In cables, BICC could treble its sales in the
region to Pounds 500m by the end of the decade, according to Sir Robin
Biggam, chairman.
The two sides of BICC may be very different, but there is common ground in
the need to have a good local presence in Asia.
Up to the mid-1980s, says Mr Thomas, Balfour Beatty's Asia-Pacific business
had benefited from the UK's aid-for-trade programme. However, the slowdown
in aid, along with the recognition that individual markets in the region
differed widely, increased the need for the company to 'think local' if it
was to benefit from the expansion of the region's infrastructure.
Some of the local contractors were just as good as Balfour Beatty, he says.
But the UK company realised it had the extra skills needed to put together
complex infrastructure projects along with local and foreign partners - and
in particular the expertise to exploit the region's fast-growing market for
private infrastructure projects.
So joint ventures, such as the successful 49 per cent owned Balfour Beatty
Sakti Indonesia and the joint venture with the Thai Sahaviriya Group, were a
necessity. 'It's the only way to obtain business, and do it profitably,'
says Mr Thomas.
Over the past two to three years, the UK group has also beefed up its
regional management. The aim is to have a senior manager for Balfour Beatty
in each country, to whom the operating subsidiary managers report.
So far Balfour Beatty has stopped short of creating an overall business
chief for Asia, although Mr Thomas is spending most of his time in that
role.
Such a move has recently been announced, however, in the sister cables
business, which is forming a new company, BICC Asia-Pacific Cables, to
manage the manufacture and marketing of power and communication cables in
the region. The new company, owned jointly by BICC and Metal Manufactures,
its 61 per cent owned Australian subsidiary, will be based in Singapore
under Mr Nigel Taylor, its managing director.
Mr Allen, who has been based in London, acknowledges: 'You can direct and
give advice, but you can't 'think Asian' from London.'
The venture will be chaired by Mr Glenn Dudley, managing director of MM,
which is paying BICC between ADollars 65m and ADollars 75m (Pounds 30m to
Pounds 35m) for taking part. MM, which also makes copper tubes and plastic
pipes and has electrical wholesaling interests, has lifted its exports to
neighbouring countries from ADollars 20m to ADollars 235m over the past five
years.
The link-up will enable MM to benefit from its UK parent's longer
involvement in the Asia region. By working together, the two companies will
be able to 'open up more fronts more quickly,' says Mr Dudley.
BICC is already the biggest exporter of cables into the region, but the
venture's key task will be to oversee the development of a much bigger
manufacturing base.
Inevitably, PCM sees China as the biggest prospect for the cable business,
either through new investment or co-operation with existing companies. BICC
is involved in discussions with China's Shanghai Cable Works on a possible
manufacturing joint venture.
In Vietnam MM is taking the lead. It is refurbishing a small
telecommunications cable plant owned by Vietnam's main post and telephones
company. Payment could form part of the equity in a joint venture which Mr
Dudley hopes to negotiate over the next 12 months.
Both BICC and MM see Indonesia as a good opportunity, and a joint venture is
a distinct possibility. In the Philippines, tentative talks have been held
with a big local group.
Both men stress that choosing the right local partner is crucial and that
they will not be rushed into making investments. 'The market is great, but
you've got to do it right to make money,' says Mr Dudley - a view with which
all the companies 'tackling Asia's tigers' would concur.
This concludes the series. Previous articles appeared on August 9, 13, 17,

In June Chime reversed into Chartwell, the cubicle and carpet tile
manufacturer. In September it disposed of the carpet tile business to a
Sirdar subsidiary for Pounds 1.4m.
Chime also announced in September the acquisition of Green Moon, a
specialist consumer public relations company, for Pounds 1.1m in a mixture

FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Etam doubles but gives warning of weaker
trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Etam, the fashion retailer, fell yesterday as the group almost
doubled interim profits, but warned of a slightly weaker trend at the
beginning of the second half.
The shares, which have performed strongly since hitting a low for the year
of 217p in April, fell by 20 1/2 p to close at 282p.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to August 13 rose from Pounds 2.41m to
Pounds 4.74m. The latest figure was struck after a Pounds 1.06m loss on the
disposal of shops.
Sales for the group, which is heavily reliant on the second half for its
profits, were ahead 5 per cent at Pounds 113.4m (Pounds 108.2m).
Mr Keith Miles, finance director, said the group was not reading too much
into the slightly weaker trend since the end of the first half. 'It's
nothing dramatic.'
But he pointed to the recent interest rate rise, tax increases, particularly
on dometic heating, and the autumn budget as deterrents to consumers.
At the same time, the group had had a good first half, benefiting from six
weeks of good weather which left it with very little in stocks to mark down.
Gross margins improved from 4.8 to 7.7 per cent.
'We are obviously quite pleased with these results,' he said. 'It was always
our strategy to rebuild the bottom line.'
Interest receivable grew from Pounds 28,000 to Pounds 273,000, and the group
ended the half with cash of Pounds 13.7m, compared with borrowings of Pounds
2.7m previously.
Capital expenditure rose from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 4.8m as the group
embarked on a big store refurbishment programme.
Mr Miles said spending for the year would be as high as Pounds 17m, with
about Pounds 9m being spent on 55 branches before the end of November.
'We have come through the recession and established a platform from which to
move forward. It's nice to be able to do that with your own cash,' he said.
The group now operates 224 stores, of which 180 feature the Etam and Tammy
brands, and 30 feature Etam, Tammy and Snob. Tammy sells children's wear,
while Snob, which has been cut, targets younger women.
While the number of stores is slightly lower, the selling space increased
from 843,000 sq ft to 857,000 sq ft.
Earnings per share rose from 2p to 4.28p. The interim dividend is increased
from 1.75p to 1.95p.
COMMENT
This was a sparkling set of interim results, well ahead of City
expectations. But the cautious trading statement was enough to prompt
investors to take their profits after seeing the stock outperform the stores
sector by more than 20 per cent over the last three months. Etam is trying
to edge up its margins at the same time as improving both its image and the
quality of its goods. The strategy paid off in the first half, and the
company sees further benefits as its refurbishment programme gathers pace.
The dip in sales in the first seven weeks of the second half could be merely
a rogue trading period. Forecasts have been upgraded to about Pounds 18m for
this year and Pounds 21m for 1995-96, giving a prospective multiple of 13.5.
This is a small discount to the sector and looks fair value.

FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Paper industry passes the parcel - Deborah
Hargreaves finds ample evidence of inflationary pressures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, wants proof of the
pressures of inflation in the economy he need look no further than the paper
and packaging industry, where prices have risen by at least 30 per cent this
year.
Paper companies are looking to pass on massive increases in raw materials
costs after a doubling of wood pulp prices to Dollars 700 a tonne in recent
months. The price of waste paper, which is the raw material for many
packaging grades, has trebled this year.
But companies in the sector, which are all predicting a surge in income from
the turnaround in the economic cycle, talk of price recovery rather than
price increases. 'These prices are only coming back to the level they were
at four to five years ago,' says Mr Brendon Smurfit at Dublin-based paper
and packaging company Jefferson Smurfit.
Pulp prices peaked at Dollars 840 a tonne at the top of the last cycle in
1990, which suggests that the latest round of rises may well continue as
supplies become tighter. Non-integrated paper and packaging companies must
pass on these costs to their own customers or face a squeeze on margins.
'The size of the cost increases have been such that, if the industry did not
recover them from its customers, companies would go bust,' says Mr David
Lyon, chief executive of Bowater, the packaging and printing group.
Some companies have been more successful than others in forcing through
increases but most see the market heading upwards. Arjo Wiggins Appleton,
the Anglo-French paper company, reported a 45 per cent rise in costs at its
interim results meeting, with more increases in the pipeline.
Mr Alain Soulas, chief executive, said the fine paper market had been slower
to accept price increases, but the company was managing to push through
rises of 5-10 per cent for most grades this month.
Mr Smurfit said the recovery of raw materials costs had been 'slower than
we'd like, but it is starting to happen in most major markets'.
According to research by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, prices for packaging grades
of paper - waste-based testliner used for making corrugated board -
increased by 85 per cent this year in France to the equivalent of Pounds 279
a tonne, and by 95 per cent in Germany to Pounds 283 a tonne.
A similar grade made from virgin fibre - kraftliner - rose by 52 per cent to
Pounds 339 a tonne in the UK.
Increased demand for paper and packaging goods is an important indicator of
economic recovery - companies need more packaging material to wrap their
surging shipments. Mr Lyon reckons that, very crudely, for every 1 per cent
rise in gross domestic product, demand for packaging materials increases by
1-1.25 per cent and for paper by around 2 per cent.
Mr Lyon says Bowater has seen demand rise by about 3-4 per cent this year.
Mr Peter Williams, chief executive of David S. Smith Holdings, the UK paper,
packaging and office supplies group which produces waste-based packaging
material, says European demand has risen by 6-7 per cent.
In the current economic cycle, pulp prices have risen more rapidly than at
other periods as growing environmental restrictions on forest products, and
the threat of a strike in British Columbia - one of the world's biggest
suppliers - combined to tighten world supply. In addition, changes in
recycling rules in Germany have pushed up waste paper prices.
Demand for paper and packaging goods has finally caught up with increased
capacity installed by companies at the height of the previous boom. In a
fiercely competitive market where companies are producing a commodity
product, many companies sought to hold on to market share during the
recession by deeply discounting prices.
Price discounts have now mostly been eliminated and the market for most
paper grades is set to go higher. Mr Soulas said the European market for
paper prices in June had only recovered to the same level as in June 1993
after dropping in some cases by 25 per cent in the second half of last year.
But price increases in September and October had pushed the market generally
7 per cent higher than last year, he noted.
Price rises will soon extend to the newsprint sector, where newspapers begin
annual supply contract negotiations in coming months. Mr Tim Rothwell, paper
and packaging analyst at BZW, expects spot prices for newsprint to increase
by 7-10 per cent this month with more rises coming through next year.
The turnround in the market for most paper and packaging companies has seen
share prices recovering from the doldrums of recent years. The paper and
packaging sector of the FT-SE-A All-Share index has risen by 14.5 per cent
in the past year. Most observers believe there is considerable room for
further advances.
'I don't think anyone can predict the cycle accurately, but I think
companies will get a good run until 1998 and maybe even 2000,' says Mr
Rothwell. Most companies are upbeat on the outlook for the next couple of
years. 'We are looking towards the whole of 1996 as the peak of the cycle,'
says Mr Lyon.
One problem for the industry is that as soon as companies' fortunes start to
improve, they are tempted to add capacity, which contributes to the next
downturn. 'The roller coaster ride over the past 20 years has been due to
too many global players chasing volume,' says Mr Rothwell.
Mr Smurfit hopes companies will be more cautious about re-investing: 'We
hope the industry has learned some of the lessons from the depth of the last
recession. It wasn't a recession in volume terms, but oversupply led to deep
discounting.'
Mr Williams says the tougher environmental legislation that many companies
face, particularly in North America, could discourage them from building new
plant.
Environmental restrictions are also likely to limit the availability of
forest products for paper-making, and waste paper supplies are becoming
tighter. These factors could give the industry a better long-term outlook
than it has enjoyed for many years.
Tomorrow Tim Burt reports on chemicals companies' efforts to pass on sharp
increases in raw material prices.

FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Singapore company gives new twist to BS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Singapore company is understood to be interested in buying the Kerman
family interests in BS Group, the property and leisure group formerly known
as Bristol Scotts.
It is the latest twist in a long power struggle at the Bristol-based company
which led to the removal of Mr Anthony Kerman as chairman in August.
Mr Kerman, who remains a director, and other family members, control a
quarter of the share capital. The ownership of a further 11.5 per cent is
the subject of a legal dispute.
BS, which incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 246,073 in 1993, said yesterday
it had been told by the Stock Exchange a 'third party has made approaches to
certain shareholders as a result of which there could be a change in
ownership of the Kerman family's undisputed interest'.
The company said the non-Kerman members of the board, and the company's
advisers, Singer &amp; Friedlander, were contacting the Kerman family 'with a
view to discussing this disposal in the best interests of all the
shareholders'.
No response had yet been made by the Kerman family.
Sir Ian Rankin, who replaced Mr Kerman as chairman, said he understood the
approach had been made by a property-orientated company listed on the
Singapore stock exchange. While he wished to see the Kermans' holding
reduced and the share ownership expanded, he would not welcome the Singapore
group taking too large a stake in case that deterred institutional
investors.
Sir Ian, who through a Jersey trust has an 8 per cent holding, added: 'If
the Kermans were thinking of the rest of the shareholders, they would
understand why we and the other directors wish for a wider shareholding.'
Mr Anthony Kerman did not comment yesterday.
The shares closed at 188p, up 13p.

FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Dolphin Packaging edges ahead to Pounds
1.15m midway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dolphin Packaging, which supplies its products mainly to the food industry,
reported near-static turnover and profits for the half year to end-June.
On turnover marginally up from Pounds 12.6m to Pounds 12.7m pre-tax profits
were ahead slightly from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 1.15m. Earnings came out at
3.47p (3.42p) per share and the interim dividend is maintained at 1.7p.
Mr Moger Wooley, chairman, said that raw materials costs had been rising at
30 to 40 per cent a year. These increases were too great to be absorbed, he
said, and would have to be passed on to customers.
Mr Wooley also announced he was to retire in the new year. The post of
chairman would be filled by Mr Harry Evans, currently chief executive, who
will be succeeded by Mr David Marsh.

FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Withdrawal from pipelines puts Galliford
Pounds 5.9m in red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Galliford fell by 7p to 27p as the Midlands-based contractor and
housebuilder revealed pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.88m for the year to June
30, against profits of Pounds 412,000 last time.
Losses per share emerged at 5.04p (earnings of 0.33p) and the unchanged
final dividend of 0.5p maintains the total as 1p. This is the third year
running that the dividend has been paid from reserves.
The pre-tax losses can be blamed on the now discontinued pipeline
rehabilitation business. The group said that losses on the withdrawal from
this activity were in line with those anticipated in April, when it decided
to discontinue the business.
Pipeline operating losses were Pounds 2.92m, on turnover of Pounds 10.8m.
There was, in the words of Mr Richard Miles, chairman, a full provision of
Pounds 3.08m against losses on contracts still being run out. In addition
costs of Pounds 339,000 were carried for redundancies and closure costs.
Mr Miles stressed that, stripping out the discontinued operations, profits
would have been Pounds 116,000, against losses of Pounds 516,000.
Group turnover edged ahead to Pounds 219.8m (Pounds 215.7m).
The construction division incurred losses of Pounds 2.41m (profits Pounds
408,000) on turnover of Pounds 129m (Pounds 126m).
The division is following industry trends in seeking better margins from
low-speculation development joint ventures, partnership projects in the
private sector and securing land for housing associations.
Housebuilding lifted profits to Pounds 2.03m (Pounds 1.58m) on increased
turnover of Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 9.03m). Margins were maintained at 17 per
cent and completions totalled 223, up 31 per cent. The average sale price
was Pounds 53,400 (Pounds 53,135).
The landbank was increased with the acquisition of 385 plots. The cost was
undisclosed, but the group said it would not buy at prices from which it
could not make margins of 18 per cent.
Merchanting achieved profits of Pounds 447,000 (losses Pounds 717,000) as
turnover rose to Pounds 50.3m (Pounds 44.9m).

FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Wetherspoon advances to Pounds 6.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JD Wetherspoon, the pubs operator floated two years ago, raised pre-tax
profits in the year to July 31 by 55 per cent from Pounds 4.17m to Pounds
6.48m, thanks mainly to its brisk rate of pub openings and a revival in
drinks sales.
Heavy price promotion in January and February helped turn round
like-for-like drink sales from a first-half decline of 5 per cent to a
second-half rise of 6 per cent.
One of Wetherspoon's regular promotions is to offer one brand of beer at 99p
a pint, but the cost was cut further to 79p at one point in the winter.
Having reasserted itself as price competitive, it gradually raised prices
again.
Mr Tim Martin, chairman, said second-half drink sales had also benefited
from two months of good summer weather.
Like-for-like catering sales rose 14 per cent in the year. Margins benefited
from cost savings now that food was being delivered to the pubs by a
third-party distributor.
Wetherspoon's shares, which were floated at 160p, fell by 14p to 406p
yesterday.
Analysts attributed the dip to profit-taking after a strong recent rise.
Forecasts are for pre-tax profits of about Pounds 9.5m this year, earnings
per share of 24.4p and 7.9p for the dividend.
Turnover in the period under review rose 51 per cent to Pounds 46.6m
(30.8m).
The recommended final dividend of 4.4p makes a payout of 6.6p (5.4p) for the
full-year.
Earnings per share rose 29 per cent to 18.2p (14.1p), reflecting a
one-for-four rights issue in March.
The rights issue and retained profits cut year-end debt to Pounds 16.1m
(Pounds 21.8m) and gearing to 22 per cent (50 per cent).
Capital expenditure totalled Pounds 23.2m, financed by the rights issue and
Pounds 11m of net cash from operations after Pounds 4.4m in interest, tax
and divi dends.
Wetherspoon opened 16 pubs within the M25 area and four outside in the year,
at a typical cost of about Pounds 780,000 each.
It plans to open another 14 this year, split evenly between inside and
outside the M25.
Mr Martin said the company was aiming for about 130 pubs within two years.
Its newer, larger pubs were typically selling about 1,500 barrels of beer a
year and turning over Pounds 750,000, compared with an average of about
Pounds 300,000 for a typical brewer's tied pub.

FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Sherwood blames slack demand for 23% fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Sherwood Group fell by 12p to 99p yesterday after the clothing and
lace manufacturer blamed weak UK demand for a 23 per cent decline in first
half profits.
Increased competition and sluggish orders for the company's socks and
lingerie helped push down pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.76m to Pounds 5.96m,
despite increased turnover of Pounds 76.4m (Pounds 69.3m), including Pounds
2.25m from acquisitions.
Although earnings per share fell from 4.8p to 3.1p in the six months to July
1, the dividend is raised to 1.15p (1p).
Justifying the rise, Mr David Parker, chairman, said: 'Sales have picked up
and we're now more optimistic about the second half.'
He also pointed out that the first half figures were depressed by
reorganisation costs in the UK and among its subsidiary lace manufacturers
in continental Europe.
The group has cut its European workforce by 18 per cent to 450 and plans to
close a factory in Germany, at a cost of Pounds 550,000.
It has also spent Pounds 200,000 reorganising its domestic garments
business, which will no longer produce children's clothing. The division's
operating profits fell by 16 per cent, from Pounds 4.41m to Pounds 3.7m,
following losses in children's outerwear and lower sales of socks and
lingerie. Sales, however, rose 13 per cent to Pounds 34.4m (Pounds 30.5m)
thanks to increased contributions from Lepel, the Italian lingerie
manufacturer acquired last year.
Profits in the lace division fell from Pounds 4.64m to Pounds 3.42m despite
modestly increased turnover of Pounds 42.7m (Pounds 39.9m).
Net borrowings, meanwhile, rose from Pounds 22.9m to Pounds 37.2m,
equivalent to gearing of 57 per cent, following payment of a deferred
consideration for Lapel and the acquisition of Intimate Touch, the US lace
distributor, in February.
The group also spent Pounds 7.1m on new equipment and facilities, which Mr
Parker predicted would enable it to exploit any increase in demand.
COMMENT
Analysts were rightly dismayed by these results and made swingeing cuts in
their full-year forecasts. On even the best expectations, profits are
unlikely to exceed Pounds 16m, some 24 per cent below earlier forecasts of
about Pounds 21m. The shares look cheap on a forward multiple of 12, but it
would take a brave investor to back a clothing company relying on lace - a
mature business - and garment sales which have fallen sharply. The problem
for Sherwood is that it has relatively little exposure to Marks and Spencer,
the most lucrative customer for clothing manufacturers. Its rivals tend to
be more aggressive with their suppliers, and it shows in the number of
cancelled orders. The shares should stabilise if sales pick up in the second
half, but a return to last year's peak looks remote.

FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Schroders and News Corp avoid High Court
battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A High Court battle between News Corporation, the media group owned by Mr
Rupert Murdoch, and J Henry Schroder Wagg, the merchant bank, has been
averted after both sides agreed to drop the proceedings.
News Corp said in a statement it had been advised by the bank's solicitors
that Schroders did not wish to defend the writ issued by News.
'Schroders have now agreed to abandon any claim it might have had against
News on the basis that News will not pursue any claim for legal costs
against Schroders,' it stated.
A dispute arose over announcements made last December by three News Corp
subsidiaries. The announcements, which related to conversion of those
companies' preference shares into Royal Doulton shares, were subsequently
stated to have been made in error.
Schroders incurred losses arising from the announcements.
It recently proposed that the dispute be brought before the City Disputes
Panel for resolution. However, News Corp issued court proceedings seeking a
comprehensive court ruling that it was not liable for Schroders' claim.
Schroders, however, said in a statement it was 'not prepared to be involved
in High Court proceedings, where the costs would have been substantial and
could, in view of the amount at stake, have rendered any sum that it might
have recovered nugatory'.
The settlement with Schroders does not resolve the complaints raised by
other investors who suffered losses in connection with the announcements.
However, News Corp said it believed its agreement with Schroders
substantiated News' position. Accordingly, News does not plan to issue court
proceedings against other claimants. Should other claimants issue
proceedings against News, it vowed to 'defend its position vigorously'.

FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Receivers to Carden Park seek investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Receivers are looking for investors to inject fresh equity into Carden Park,
the 1,200 acre hotel and leisure complex near Manchester owned by Mr John
Broome.
The Bank of Scotland, sole lender on the project, has appointed Grant
Thornton as receivers under the Law of Property Act.
'We are looking at all the options. Either we find a buyer or some form of
refinancing has to be agreed,' the receivers said.
'At the moment out priorities are reassuring our suppliers and confirming
bookings which have already been made.'
Battersea Leisure Group, the company set up by Mr Broome to build a leisure
complex on the site of Battersea Power Station in London, was put into
liquidation earlier this year. That site is now in the hands of Mr George
Hwang and Mr Victor Hwang, Hong Kong property investors.
Unlike Battersea, though, Carden Park is Mr Broome's personal project and he
effectively operates as sole trader.
'I am going into business with my bankers until such time as we can attract
the new equity required,' said Mr Broome yesterday.
More than Pounds 20m has been spent over five years developing the ambitious
Carden Park complex, which includes an 83 suite hotel and golf course. The
development is aiming to attract corporate clients. Other attractions
include clay pigeon shooting and archery.
Planning consent has been granted for a number of woodland villas, a new
golf club house and a larger swimming pool. Mr Broome estimated that another
Pounds 5m would have to be spent to complete his dream.
While there are plans for further development, the complex opened for
business 10 months ago.
Mr Broome said that hotel occupancy rates were currently running at about 60
per cent.

FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Barry Wehmiller hit by tough trading
conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Annual pre-tax profits at Barry Wehmiller International declined by 28 per
cent from Pounds 7.1m to Pounds 5.12m, as the packaging equipment
manufacturer endured tough trading conditions, particularly in Europe.
However, Mr Stewart Brown, chief executive, said second half trading had
improved over a weak first half and that the outlook for 1995 was
'encouraging'. Operating profits fell 24 per cent to Pounds 5.18m (Pounds
6.82m) in the year to July 31, but the rate of decline slowed to only 10 per
cent in the second half.
Annual turnover slipped 4 per cent to Pounds 82.1m (Pounds 85.2m). The fall
was most marked in the group's Asian markets, which slid 41 per cent to
Pounds 4.41m (Pounds 7.53m).
Mr Brown said the decline was due to a slump in regional aerosol sales,
which were now recovering. Aerosol turnover fell 30 per cent to Pounds 9.41m
(Pounds 13.42m), a fire at a production plant disrupting output. Of its main
regional markets, Europe was the chief casualty, turnover retreating 8 per
cent to Pounds 16.8m (Pounds 18.19m).
Operating profits across the group's three divisions all showed a fall, with
the optical business having the steepest decline, down from Pounds 1.26m to
Pounds 73,000 over the year. Mr Brown said that margins had been squeezed by
a drive for market share in the beer and soft drinks industry, particularly
in the first half.
'Our order intake for the second half and in current trading has recovered
significantly,' said Mr Brown. 'This, together with our substantial
investment in our product and marketing in the past year makes us well
positioned for steady growth.'
He added that the group, which is relatively ungeared, was looking to make
an acquisition in the coming year, with the pharmaceuticals packaging
business a likely target area.
Earnings per share fell 32 per cent to 7.5p (11p). The final dividend was
maintained at 4.3p for a same-again 6.7p total.

Large price increases were beginning to come through in the chemicals which

Two oil palm producers ultimately owned by Rowe Evans Investments yesterday
reported reduced pre-tax profits for the first half of 1994.
Beradin Holdings, the producer of oil palm fresh fruit bunches in West
Malaysia, reported pre-tax profits down 18 per cent from Pounds 248,869 to
Pounds 203,871. Turnover was Pounds 486,007, a rise of 8 per cent on last
year's Pounds 450,624. Less favourable exchange rates resulted in a charge
of Pounds 6,546, against a profit of Pounds 19,706 a year earlier.
Earnings per share were 0.75p (0.9p).
Singapore Para Rubber Estates, which produces natural rubber as well as oil
palm fresh fruit bunches in West Malaysia, announced a 32 per cent decline
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 215,919 to Pounds 146,495.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 342,336 (Pounds 361,405). Earnings per share

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Plantation &amp; General Invest-ments, formerly Chillington Corporation,
increased pre-tax profits by 20 per cent from Pounds 808,000 to Pounds
971,000 in the six months to June 30 1994.
Turnover from continuing operations declined to Pounds 21.7m (Pounds 23.7m).
Earlier this year the company decided to concentrate on developing its
plantation and overseas trading interests and consequently reverted to its
former name.
Mr Alan Tritton, chairman, said losses from discontinued activities had been
completely eliminated, Presswork &amp; Stampings had been sold and plans were
advanced to dispose of the company's interest in Chillington Marine.
A substantial advance was expected in the second half. The interim dividend
is raised to 1p (0.75p) on earnings per share of 1.36p (1.36p).

group said the main operating companies made good advances.

Turnover was Pounds 51.8m (Pounds 45.9m). Earnings per share were 0.62p
(0.56p) and the interim dividend is unchanged at 0.65p.

FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Watts Blake in Pounds 11m German buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watts Blake Bearne &amp; Co yesterday confirmed its position as the world's
largest producer of specialist clays with a big expansion in Germany, its
main market.
The Devon-based company, which this week announced a 24 per cent increase in
first half profits, is paying Pounds 11m for Martin &amp; Pagenstecher
Rohstoffbetriebe (MPR), the ball clay mining business owned by Thyssen, the
German steel group. The consideration is Pounds 6.5m cash and Pounds 4.5m of
new borrowing.
The move comes just two days after WBB unveiled an acquisition strategy
aimed at strengthening its presence in continental Europe.
Mr David Bowden, finance director, said MPR's operations would be partially
integrated into Fuchs-Ton, WBB's German subsidiary. 'Immediate benefits will
be obtained through administrative cost saving, and the acquisition is
expected to be earnings neutral in the first year,' he said.
For the September 30 1993 year-end MPR's operating profits were Pounds
700,000. The enlarged business is expected to contribute more than 45 per
cent of group sales, which rose from Pounds 39.3m to Pounds 41.8m in the six
months to June 30.

FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Wm Low directors share over Pounds 900,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The four main directors of Wm Low, the Scottish supermarket chain acquired
by Tesco in a Pounds 300m takeover last month, shared pay-offs totalling
more than Pounds 900,000.
Mr James Millar, chairman, who had been with the company for 34 years,
received only Pounds 75,800, or the equivalent of 13 months' salary, the
amount of time his contract had left to run.
However, he will have made more than Pounds 121,000 from his personal
shareholding in Wm Low, and should have netted at least Pounds 281,000 from
exercising share options.
Mr Philip Spicer, chief executive, was on an annual salary of Pounds
115,000, but a 36-month notice period in the event of a takeover. That took
his total pay-off to Pounds 345,000.
He will have made Pounds 21,000 from his personal shareholding.
Both Mr Harvey Findlay, financial director, and Mr Sandy Leslie, buying and
marketing director, were on salaries of Pounds 81,120 and 36 months' notice.
Their pay-offs would have been Pounds 243,360 each.
Mr Findlay would also have made Pounds 13,000 from his shareholding and at
least Pounds 204,000 from share options.
Mr Leslie stands to have made another Pounds 23,000 from his shares and at
least Pounds 165,000 from share options.

FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Grainger pays Pounds 61m for Frincon - Deal
will treble Newcastle group's commercial property portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grainger Trust, the Newcastle-based property company, will more than treble
the size of its commercial property interests with the acquisition of
privately owned investor and developer Frincon for Pounds 60.8m.
Grainger is paying for the acquisition through the issue of 4m shares and
Pounds 50.7m loan notes to the family of Mr Robin Tomkins, who founded
Frincon in the late 1970s.
The deal will give the Tomkins family 16 per cent of the enlarged company.
Mr Tomkins will join Grainger's board as a non-executive director.
Frincon's assets comprise office, retail and industrial property, around
half of which is in the Colchester area. However, under the terms of the
deal Grainger has an option to sell part of the portfolio back to the
vendors in September next year.
The properties covered by the option are either substantially unlet or let
on leases that will shortly expire.
Mr Stephen Dickinson, managing director of Grainger, said the arrangement
gave the company a year to find new tenants and renegotiate leases before
deciding whether to sell in the open market or sell the properties back to
the Tomkins family.
'They may well get a lot of these properties back,' he said.
If this option is exercised, Grainger would be left with a portfolio of 32
freehold and five leasehold properties valued at Pounds 81.3m. Mr Dickinson
said these properties were mostly fully let at rents close to current market
levels.
A maximum of Pounds 29.9m of loan notes issued to the Tomkins family could
be redeemed. After allowing for Pounds 11.6m cash acquired with Frincon,
Grainger's net outlay for this portfolio would be only Pounds 19.3m.
Until now, it has specialised in buying residential property let under
regulated tenancies. Such properties are usually bought at a discount to
reflect the sitting rights of the tenants and sold when they become vacant.
Grainger is the second largest quoted residential landlord after Bradford
Property Trust. Before yesterday's deal around two thirds of its assets were
residential. This proportion will now fall to about half.
Grainger expects to have made a pre-tax profit of not less than Pounds 5.6m
in the year to September 30, compared with Pounds 1.7m last time. The latest
figures will include a Pounds 1.9m write-back on the value of current
assets.
The company also expects to pay a final dividend of 4.55p, making a total
for the year of 5.9p (5.25p).

FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind 40% advance at Ex-Lands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ex-Lands, the property investment trading company run by brothers Robert and
Graham Bourne, reported a 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 914,000 to Pounds 1.27m for the year to June 30.
The company raised Pounds 36m during the year by issuing new shares and
convertible loan stock, most of which was spent on industrial and office
trading properties. As a result, net assets increased from Pounds 16.3m to
Pounds 31.9m.
Net assets per share rose by 23 per cent to 28.7p, or 31.1p on a fully
diluted basis allowing for conversion of the outstanding loan stock.
Turnover grew from Pounds 1.27m to Pounds 5.16m, reflecting acquisitions and
the consolidation of Clubhaus, a German leisure company formerly held as a
joint venture with Mr Mark McCormack's International Management Group.
Ex-Lands spent Pounds 41m on acquisitions during the year, about half of
which was bought from banks which had been left holding property as a result
of bad debts.
Mr Robert Bourne, joint chief executive, said that such deals allowed the
company to acquire properties which could be improved by intensive
management and some investment.
Most of the property is being held as trading assets for re-sale in the near
term.
Discounting the convertible loan stock, which matures in 2020, gearing is 23
per cent. Earnings amounted to 0.98p (1.06p) and a dividend of 0.42p (0.35p)
is recommended.

FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Taylor Woodrow in US deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taylor Woodrow, the British construction group, in a joint venture with
Kenco Communities, a US developer, has paid Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.6m) for
653 acres of prime development land in Florida.
The British company has previously announced its intention to expand its
housing interests in the rapidly-growing Florida market.
The development is located in Palm Beach County in the Boca Raton area,
where it has planning permission for up 1,500 homes. There are also plans
for a 27-hole golf course, tennis centre and country club. Work is scheduled
to begin early next year.
House prices on the development are expected to range from Dollars 200,000
to more than Dollars 1m.
Mr Colin Parsons, Taylor Woodrow chairman, said: 'We have previously stated
that our strategic policy is to redirect assets to achieve growth in chosen
areas of opportunity. The market for new homes in Florida remains strong and
we see much potential for future profit.'
The group more than doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 22m
during the first six months of this year, led by a sharp rise in house
sales.
Taywood Homes in the UK increased its contribution by 50 per cent to Pounds
3m. Housing profits from the US, Canada and Australia rose from Pounds 4m to
Pounds 6m, after discounting a Pounds 3.2m write-down last year in southern
California.

Wellcome's new shingles drug, which is likely to be launched in several
markets over the next year, has had promising results in clinical trials.
A new analysis of trials on 1,100 patients shows Valtrex to be 30 per cent
faster at reducing pain than Wellcome's Zovirax. It is three times quicker
than a placebo.
The results were presented yesterday at the 34th Interscience Conference on
Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy in Orlando, Florida. Wellcome shares
rose 18p to 670p.
Valtrex was submitted for approval to drug regulatory bodies in Europe and
North America in June. Analysts forecast annual sales of up to Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 600m).

FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Kode says bid rumour is 'without
foundation'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kode International, the computer services and printed circuit board group,
yesterday dismissed rumours that it was the target of a possible takeover
bid.
Kode denied it was in discussions concerning a bid and said it was unaware
of any foundation for the rumours.
'There was a rumour in a couple of newspapers earlier in the week about the
possibility of predators lurking. These are completely without foundation,'
said Mr Geoff Harvey, finance director.
The announcement came after the company's shares rose 7p to 56p on Monday
and a further 8p to 64p on Wednesday. However, they closed down 4p at 60p
yesterday.
Kode lost half its market value in August when it reported interim pre-tax
losses of Pounds 515,000 against profits of Pounds 710,000. Turnover was
unchanged at Pounds 12.3m. The shares fell 37p to 38p as the company was
cautious about its short-term prospects.
Its computer services division, DCM Services, was severely affected by the
sudden fall in prices of third-party maintenance in the second half of 1993.
'We are happy with the progress on the circuit board side as a whole and are
continuing to address the problems in computer services,' Mr Harvey said.
Kode acquired DCM in July 1992 for Pounds 3.2m, funded by a rights issue of
3.66m new shares, and was reporting 'fierce' competition by the end of 1993.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Shake-up at Kidder may signal sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kidder Peabody, the troubled investment banking arm of General Electric, is
to move Dollars 20bn-Dollars 30bn (Pounds 12.6bn-Pounds 18.9bn) of
securities to another part of the US industrial group as part of a
restructuring announced yesterday. It also emerged that Kidder has held
talks about selling its retail broking business in the US, an operation
widely regarded as its 'crown jewel'.
These moves represent the first steps taken by the new management team put
into Kidder in June to sort out the firm's battered reputation on Wall
Street.
Kidder was rocked in April by its claim that a trader had created fictitious
profits of Dollars 350m, and its trading businesses suffered losses with the
downturn in bond markets during the spring.
The changes could also mark the first step in a disposal of Kidder. GE has
tried to sell the investment bank and is widely thought to want to either
sell it or close it down. The turmoil of recent months, though, has made the
bank unsellable in its current form, according to other Wall Street houses.
Under what it called a 'repositioning', Kidder said it would cut its balance
sheet from Dollars 80bn to Dollars 50bn-Dollars 60bn by the end of the year.
This would be achieved by shifting a Dollars 6.7bn portfolio of
difficult-to-value and complex mortgage-backed securities, known as
collateralised mortgage obligations, to part of GE Capital, the group's
financial services arm.
The remaining securities to be shed by Kidder are understood to be
instruments hold to hedge - or protect against a fall in value in - the CMO
holdings.
The shrinkage of Kidder's balance sheet will reduce any pressure on GE to
put further capital into the troubled bank. Earlier this year, Dollars 400m
of extra capital was injected into the firm to cover losses and bolster its
balance sheet. Since then, Kidder is thought to have suffered further losses
in its trading operations.
Mr Dennis Dammerman, Kidder's chairman and chief executive, said the bank
would remain in the mortgage-backed business, an area where it is the
recognised leader on Wall Street.
Kidder also said it planned to cut some 550 jobs, out of total of 5,500, as
part of an effort to reduce costs by Dollars 100m a year. It added it would
narrow the scope of its investment banking business and concentrate on a
small number of industrial sectors.
The bank refused to comment on discussions it has held with PaineWebber,
another US securities house, about selling its retail broking operation.
With 1,250 brokers, this is considered to be one of Kidder's most attractive
businesses. The discussions, which are at an early stage, could shrink the
bank's business further, leaving GE with the option of either selling or
closing down the rump that remained.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Friendly union of rivals off the rails: Union Pacific blocks
line to Burlington Northern-Santa Fe merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
One of the biggest railway mergers in US corporate history, Burlington
Northern's agreed Dollars 2.5bn takeover of Santa Fe Pacific, was yesterday
in disarray following the surprise intervention of another big US railway
company, Union Pacific, with a hostile bid worth Dollars 3.2bn.
At the end of June, Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Pacific, two of the
four big railway networks on the western side of the US, said they planned
to form the biggest railway network in the US through a friendly takeover of
Santa Fe by Burlington.
Santa Fe's shareholders were due to vote on the all-share offer next month.
But late on Wednesday night, Union Pacific, another of the four biggest
railway companies west of the Mississippi, unexpectedly launched a higher
all-share offer for Santa Fe.
Santa Fe's board last night rejected Union Pacific's unsolicited approach,
while Burlington reaffirmed its intention to press ahead with its offer,
angrily attacking the Union Pacific bid as anti-competitive.
'Our merger with Santa Fe was a direct response to the dominant position
that Union Pacific has in the west,' Burlington said. 'This is nothing more
than an attempt to stifle healthy competition in the western US.'
The immediate question posed by the Union Pacific bid is whether it is a
serious offer or simply a disruptive tactic aimed at scuppering a friendly
merger between two of its biggest rivals.
The price offered by Union Pacific will tempt Santa Fe's shareholders. But
they will have to consider the strong possibility that a merger between
Union Pacific and Santa Fe would be disallowed on anti-trust grounds.
A precedent was set 10 years ago when Santa Fe took over Southern Pacific,
the other big railway company west of the Mississippi. Long after the deal
had been completed, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the federal
authority that regulates the railway industry, ruled that the merger was
uncompetitive and ordered it to be unbundled.
Burlington and Santa Fe have argued, with some justification, that their
merger will not eliminate competition because there are relatively few
instances where their routes coincide. They describe the deal as an
end-to-end merger of two complimentary networks.
Union Pacific may find itself on less firm ground, because its prime routes
are in direct competition with those of Santa Fe. Implicitly acknowledging
the likely criticisms, Union Pacific said it was ready to guarantee open
access on the merged company's tracks to other railway companies.
The Union Pacific bid will be highly disruptive to the Burlington-Santa Fe
deal. At one extreme, it could wreck it by causing Santa Fe's shareholders
to demand a higher price for their railway than Burlington is prepared to
pay. At the very least, it will complicate the Interstate Commerce
Commission's investigation - a process that can take up to 30 months.
Union Pacific, however, insisted its offer was serious. It said the merger
it was proposing would be better for Santa Fe's shareholders and bring more
customer benefits than a merger with Burlington.
Whatever the outcome of the bid battle, the fact that two railway companies
are fighting to acquire a third will emphasise how much the fortunes of the
US railway industry have changed in the last few years.
US freight railways, once almost bankrupt, are enjoying a surge in
profitability because of cost-cutting and increases in productivity
following deregulation in 1980. Suddenly, it seems, railways are hot
properties again.

FT  07 OCT 94 / UK food brands fail to whet the investor's appetite:
Impressed, but do they want to buy the company?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why make do with just a cup of Tetley's tea or a dab of Colman's mustard? If
you really like the products, you can buy their makers. They are but two of
the UK food manufacturers officially for sale, and many more businesses
could be bought if the right offers were made to their increasingly
reluctant parents.  Northern Foods, Unigate, Hillsdown Holdings, Albert
Fisher, Dalgety, Grand Metropolitan and Unilever are some of the companies
the City believes would entertain offers for selective subsidiaries.
The last time the industry saw so many assets on the block was in the late
1980s. Most deals then were driven by ambitions to get into food
manufacturing. It was seen as a growth area protected by strong brands and
highly processed foods.
This time the pressure is on the sell side. Some companies such as Allied
Domecq, seller of Tetley and the rest of its food activities, and Reckitt &amp;
Colman, seller of the eponymous mustard plus the rest of its UK food and
drink lines, have decided to redeploy their capital in spirits and household
cleaners respectively.
The sellers also include companies, still committed to food, which are
disposing of some brands to focus their food portfolio more sharply.
Dalgety, for example, is making food a solely UK business while pushing its
international ambitions in food ingredients and petfoods.
The trading environment is making food manufacturers reconsider their
strategies. 'A number of companies are finding it too hot to stay in,' says
Mr Ian Davis, a director of McKinsey, the management consultants.
Food price deflation, increasing competition from supermarket own-label
products and price-conscious consumers have combined to shred manufacturers'
profit margins. Crisps, baked beans and bread are just three products where
prices have been driven down to uneconomic levels.
Each manufacturer has its own bete noire. For Associated British Foods, the
largest UK baker, it is the supermarkets. 'Supermarkets' own labels leave us
branded fellows adrift,' says Mr Garry Weston, ABF's chairman. He is now
more interested in food ingredients than foods, and preferably outside the
UK. To that end, ABF bought its first US manufacturing plants this week.
Not all products are similarly afflicted. Some, such as prepared sauces, are
fast growing. Strong niche sectors such as mustard are too small to attract
an own-label onslaught. On the downside, though, packaged ambient foods are
losing out to chilled and frozen foods. Some products need reviving. Tea and
cakes, for example, look stodgy in the face of newer drinks and snacks.
Given the industry's problems, who would be buyers? The obvious ones are
multinationals wanting to build up UK operations. CPC and Heinz from the US,
and Danone (formerly BSN) and Nestle from continental Europe are mentioned
most often.
Among UK companies, Northern, Unigate and Hillsdown are likely to turn
buyers now they are close to selling off the last bits they do not want.
Allied Domecq's food ingredients business could appeal to Dalgety and ABF at
the right price.
Other companies are keen to buy brands or plants which bring economies of
scale to manufacture and marketing while building market shares. But it is
hard to find a company to buy to get you into fast growing areas, says Mr
Richard Clothier, chief executive of Dalgety. The rare targets are typically
'small companies that can't fund their own growth'. The UK also remains an
efficient place to make food for foreign sale, where its value justifies the
transport costs. ABF, for example, is sending frozen garlic bread to
Holland.
The debate over prices is becoming heated. Some sellers 'have stretched
their profit margins to glory relative to own-label products,' says one food
manufacturer, expressing surprise at high asking prices.
'The sellers are still hankering after the prices of yesteryear but the
buyers are looking to the low margins of tomorrow,' says Mr Michael
Landymore, a Henderson Crosthwaite analyst.
A study by Smith New Court of food acquisitions shows Cadbury Schweppes
paying 15.5 times cashflow and two times book value for Trebor. The purchase
gave it a big leg up in sugar confectionery and a mint brand to compete
against Nestle's Polo. In contrast, Hobson bought the Co-op's largely
own-label food business, for seven times cash flow and 1.3 times book value.
Where bid and ask prices are far apart, realism could prevail in many cases.
The restructuring pressures are too great to ignore. 'People are realising
they are not the right owners of some of their assets,' one strategist says.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Airfix flies back from US duty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flotillas and squadrons of UK and US military might have been recalled from
a lengthy tour of duty on the other side of the Atlantic. Already new plans
and strategies have been discussed and morale is rising.
The ships and aircraft, being miniature and plastic, are safe from defence
cuts.
Airfix - a name familiar to boys of all ages - leads the task force. It is
part of Humbrol, a Pounds 20m hobby paint products company which also
includes Heller, the French model kits maker.
Humbrol, which is also the UK's largest supplier of coffin varnish, this
week came under the command of Allen McGuire, a Dublin investment
partnership.
Allen McGuire bought Humbrol from Borden, the US foods group which has
agreed to merge with buy-out specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. Borden
bought Humbrol's models, paints and DIY business in the 1980s - Airfix's
life as a independent UK company ended in receivership in 1981  - and lodged
it briefly alongside resins in its chemicals arm. Humbrol was later moved
into the international foods division - the logic being that it made
consumer products - where it languished until Borden started slimming down
to its core businesses.
Mr Mike Ganley, Humbrol's managing director since the beginning of this
year, will stay on as chief of staff. He said Allen McGuire had spotted a
rare opportunity. Indeed the current top 10 table at Hamleys, the London
store, shows traditional toys such as teddy bears, Barbie and Lego eclipsing
electronic games.
'Airfix has an exceptionally large mould bank going back 40 years, with
about 200 moulds never used,' Mr Ganley said. He is keen to grasp 'whatever
hot licensing opportunities come up', and move beyond the military core,
though this year's D-Day observances boosted sales and next year's
end-of-war anniversary should too. He also wants to build up the DIY side.
But kits remain the palace guard. Britain's Institute of Plastic Modellers
has about 8,000 members, Mr Ganley noted, 'probably more than in the
Institute of Directors'.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Four new judges appointed to European Court of Justice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seven lawyers, largely unknown outside their own countries, were appointed
unopposed yesterday to the most powerful judicial body in Europe.
The appointments to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg represent
the single biggest turnover of personnel in the court's history. Half the
judges and their advisers up for reappointment are stepping down.
The power these European lawyers wield was underlined last week when the
court awarded retrospective pension rights to part-time workers, leaving
employers facing possible costs of billions of pounds.
Colleagues in the profession yesterday said so little was known about the
new judges it was difficult to assess what impact they would have on the
court's judgments. Every three years the court replaces several of its 13
judges and six advisers. Judges are appointed for six-year terms and many
usually stand for reappointment. In 1991 only two members of the court
changed.
The judges stepping down are Mr Manuel Diez de Velasco from Spain, the
French judge Mr Fernand Grevisse, and the German Mr Manfred Zuleeg. In
addition, the president of the court, Mr Ole Due, a Dane, has resigned. A
new president will be chosen from among the judges by secret ballot today.
Mr Due has been been replaced by his Danish adviser, Mr Claus Gulmann. Two
other advisers have resigned, so three have been appointed - Mr Philippe
Leger from France, Mr Georgios Cosmas from Greece and Mr Michael Elmer from
Denmark.
Appointment to the court is by 'common accord' of the member state
governments. There is no nationality requirement, but in practice each
member state nominates one of its own nationals. The 13th judge is normally
chosen on rotation from among the five largest member states.
The Spanish judge was the 13th judge and is being replaced by an Italian, Mr
Antonio La Pergola. The new French judge is Mr Jean-Pierre Puissochet and
the new German judge is Mr Gunter Hirsch.
In the UK, candidates tend to be either judges or senior barristers, and are
nominated by the Foreign Office on the advice of the lord chancellor. Judges
from other member states tend either to be academics or to have held senior
positions in their country's administrations.
Perhaps most is known about Mr La Pergola. He is a former president of the
Italian Constitutional Court and close ally of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the
Italian prime minister.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Row looms over Pounds 1.3bn French aid proposal for Bull
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A fresh storm over the use of government aid to prop up ailing European
companies is likely next week.
Mr Karel Van Miert, European competition commissioner, is expected to
recommend approval of payments totalling FFr11bn (Pounds 1.32bn) from the
French government to Groupe Bull, the loss-making computer group.
This will heighten tension between the Commission and private European
enterprise amid growing criticism that Brussels is not doing enough to stop
governments distorting competition through state-funded rescue plans.
This week the UK government and seven European airlines appealed to the
European Court of Justice to annul the Commission's decision to allow the
French government to grant FFr20bn in fresh subsidies to Air France, the
national carrier.
The Commission told the French government earlier this year to suspend a
capital injection of FFr2.5bn for Bull pledged in February 1993 by a
previous administration. At the end of last year, the centre-right
government of Mr Edouard Balladur announced a new capitalisation plan of
FFr8.6bn of which FFr1.6bn would come from France Telecom, a shareholder in
Bull.
Mr Van Miert's recommendation is likely to go before his fellow
commissioners for approval next week. With only a majority of votes required
for authorisation, it is almost certain the French government will win the
go-ahead for the capital injection.
The Commission is likely to attach conditions to the granting of aid, which
will probably stipulate that Groupe Bull stick to its own restructuring
proposals and receive no more aid during the restructuring.
The French government claims the capital injections are a vital element in a
package aimed at restoring the group to profitability after accumulated
losses of about FFr20bn since 1989. Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry
minister, has described the capital injections as a 'one time-last time'
injection before the privatisation of the group.
The restructuring package, implemented by Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, who
took over as chairman of the computer group last year, involves a sharp cut
in overhead costs, the sale of assets, and the reduction of the company's
Paris sites from 24 to two. An existing plan to cut 6,500 jobs in 1993 and
this year has been accelerated.
According to Bull, the restructuring has helped to cut losses in the first
half of the year to June were reduced to FFr843m, compared with FFr1.98bn
for the comparable period in 1993.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Taiwan share row raises worries on Belfast plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON and GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The British government yester-day launched an urgent inquiry into a Taipei
stock market controversy involving subsidiaries of Hualon, a Taiwanese group
which is due to receive Pounds 61m of aid for a contentious textiles plant
project in Belfast.
The affair, which sent Taipei share prices plunging for the second
consecutive day yesterday, broke as Taiwanese authorities detained senior
executives of Hualon for questioning and suspended trading by two of the
group's brokerage houses after a series of payment defaults.
This is the second stock market controversy in two years linked to Mr Oung
Ta-Ming, one of Taiwan's wealthiest businessmen, who effectively heads
Hualon but occupies no formal position in the group. In 1992 a Taiwan court
sentenced Mr Oung to 3 1/2 years in prison for breach of trust, though the
conviction was later overturned on appeal.
Northern Ireland's Department of Economic Development said it was seeking
urgently to establish exactly what had happened in the Taipei market. The
inquiry is being handled by officials from the department and the industrial
development board, which has an office in Taipei.
Brokers in Taipei said yesterday's 4.2 per cent fall in the stock market
occurred when retail investors learned underground financiers had abruptly
withdrawn funds advanced to speculators, triggering defaults.
The Taiwan Securities and Exchange Commission said the defaults so far
involved 18 local brokerage houses and amounted to TDollars 6.6bn, but that
the final total could turn out to be higher.
The commission said TDollars 2.7bn (Pounds 65.10m) of the defaults involved
companies linked to Hualon and it ordered Hung Fu Securities and Yung Feng
Securities to suspend trading. Mr Day Linin, chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, said the Taiwan stock exchange would use a TDollars 9bn
stabilisation fund, established after a similar affair two years ago, to
cover share payment defaults.
Four associates of Mr Oung were detained at Chiang Kai-Shek International
airport early yesterday as they went to board a flight to Hong Kong.
Though Mr Oung, as a member of Taiwan's parliament, is effectively immune
from prosecution, his and Hualon's involvement in the incident threaten
further to embarrass the Northern Ireland Office. The office has already
been criticised for backing the Pounds 157m Belfast textiles plant.
European textile manufacturers are challenging in the European Court the
European Commission's decision earlier this year to approve aid for the
plant.

FT  07 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: US railroads
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Union Pacific's desire to create the US's largest railroad company by buying
Santa Fe Pacific makes strategic sense, but is unlikely to happen. If
history is any guide, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the all-powerful
railroad regulator, will oppose the deal because it would reduce
competition.
Such a decision would be a mistake. Not only would regulatory rejection
deprive shareholders of a bid a third higher than Burlington Northern's
competing offer, but it would hinder efforts to wring further inefficiencies
out of the system. These inefficiencies, despite the recent railroad
renaissance, remain legendary.
The fragmented rail network is an immense burden on the US economy. It
drives up costs, delays deliveries and prevents the sector winning business
from road haulage. Rationalisation would also allow rail companies to cut
duplicative headquarters, rail routes and repair shops, as well as expand
geographical coverage and the range of products carried. The reduced costs
could then be passed on to customers in the Dollars 200bn US freight market.
Union Pacific is trying to allay anti-competitive fears by offering other
carriers access to its routes. If the ICC is going to make the mistake of
rejecting its deal, it were best done quickly. But its record suggests the
body could take more than two years to come to a conclusion. That would
leave all three companies derailed for the duration.

Allianz's announcement that it is looking for acquisitions abroad, including
in the UK, comes only days after the purchase of Swiss Re's primary
insurance business. A significant turning point has been reached: after
several years of consolidation, the colossal insurer is ready for further
expansion.
The new willingness to pursue acquisitions coincides with signs of
robustness in the domestic German market, the traditional mainstay of group
profits. The underwriting cycle has turned: premium rates are rising, helped
by economic recovery, and there has been a welcome fall in car theft. This
summer's insurance market liberalisation has not led to a dramatic
intensification of competition, as once feared. Foreign insurers still find
it difficult to break into Germany, and domestic competition is muted. There
are still headaches in the US, where Fireman's Fund lost DM164m in the first
half on catastrophe risks, and the state of world financial markets will hit
investment income. But on balance Allianz feels confident enough to revive a
global growth strategy which has been on hold since 1990.
Whether this will prove good for shareholders is another question. Some of
Allianz's past acquisitions, for example that of Deutsche Versicherung, seem
to defy normal pay-back criteria. But investors treat Allianz as a proxy for
the German market. As a result, the economics of individual transactions
matter less than sentiment on Germany as a whole.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On their own, yesterday's UK industrial output figures can be interpreted
any way one likes. Those inclined to fret about consumer confidence may
focus on the drop in production of footwear and clothing. Those who believe
in robust growth can point to distortions from the rail strike and the
explosion at the Milford haven oil refinery. But together with recent data
on housing, CBI survey evidence and short-time working at Ford, the output
data do suggest some slowdown in the pace of growth. Worries about higher
base rates seem to be abating: indeed the money markets are shading down
their expectations in this regard.
The authorities' thinking may become clearer on Monday when minutes are
published of the meeting at which September's base rate rise was decided.
The aim appears to be the laudable one of preventing the output gap closing
too quickly, which would unleash inflation, while still preserving the
recovery. In that case, a modest deceleration of growth now would be welcome
in helping the chancellor achieve the required balance.
Amid all the bond market turbulence it is easy to lose sight of the way in
which investors have given the authorities credit for the base rate rise.
Equities have fallen 155 points since then, and the long bond yield is
unchanged at just over 8.6 per cent. But the yield premium of gilts over US
and German government stock has narrowed by 30 and 15 basis points
respectively. That shows some faith in the value of Mr Clarke's pre-emptive
strike.

FT  07 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Sky is the limit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BSkyB is the classic ugly duckling turned swan. The satellite network has
rapidly turned losses into profits and is now ready to float away. The
immediate benefit to shareholders will be the release of Pounds 1.2bn in
shareholder loans and guarantees. Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation,
still heavily indebted after near-insolvency in 1990, could certainly use
its Pounds 600m share. As shown by last week's plan to issue preference
shares, Mr Murdoch is searching for ways to raise capital without losing
control. Speculation is bound to mount that he is back on the acquisition
trail.
A BSkyB float will also have the benefit for its present shareholders of
making the value of their stakes more visible. Further cash could be raised
by cutting their stakes after the planned one-year lock-up expires. Granada
does not need cash now given that its approach to caterer Gardner Merchant
has been rejected. But if the government relaxes rules on cross-media
ownership, the group may wish to add to its ITV interests.
Cynics will say the float's timing is dictated by the fact that the threat
to Sky from cable TV is not yet fully apparent. Sky currently makes the same
profit irrespective of whether its programmes are distributed by cable or
via dishes. But as cable companies roll out their networks and start making
their own programmes, they may take fewer Sky channels. Cable groups will
also be in a stronger position to bargain for a better deal on those
channels they do take. That said, this threat will take several years to
materialise. Meanwhile, BSkyB stands to benefit from growth not only in
subscriber fees but in advertising revenue which currently accounts for only
20 per cent of its income.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Bretton twins at an awkward age: The fundamental task of the
World Bank and IMF is to do themselves out of a job, argues Martin Wolf. But
they have much to do
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has not been a particularly happy 50th birthday for the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But 50th birthdays are often unhappy. By
that age, people have built up, along with a record of achievements, a list
of disappointments and mistakes. The attitudes and knowledge acquired in
their youth have often become outmoded. Usually, they have made enemies as
well.
So it is for the twins born at the Bretton Woods conference in July 1944.
For all the show at their annual meetings in Madrid this week, these are
troubled giants. They have a host of enemies and many friends do not like
them much either. This is not just a natural time to take stock. It is
essential for these institutions to do so.
The brilliantly achieved aim of the Bretton Woods conference was to
re-establish a global market economy. But it was to be a guided capitalism.
The assumption - particularly on the part of the British delegation, headed
by the economist Lord Keynes - was that there would be no return to a world
of free capital flows and 'hot money'. Finance was to be kept in chains.
Thus, the articles of the IMF required that currencies be convertible only
on current account (to pay for goods and services). Governments could retain
controls on capital movements, to enable them to maintain fixed exchange
rates while pursuing policies for full employment. The IMF was to underpin
this combination. Similarly, the World Bank was created to finance post-war
reconstruction and economic development, because the private capital flows
that had financed growth in the late-19th century, would or, it was
believed, should not return.
In the light of the Great Depression and contemporary advances in economic
thought, these were reasonable assumptions. But they have been undermined by
history. The IMF lost its envisaged function with the collapse of the fixed
exchange rate system in the early 1970s, largely caused by the impossibility
of combining pursuit of full employment with fixed exchange rates, once
capital flows were set free.
Since then the Fund has increasingly become the macro-economic policeman of
the more fallible developing countries, encouraging them to change economic
policy when in balance of payments difficulties. Under three entrepreneurial
managing directors, it also found a wider role in co-ordinating
international responses to the oil crises of the 1970s, the debt crisis of
the 1980s, and Soviet communism's collapse.
Similarly, the World Bank has been elbowed aside by surging private capital
flows, after the long hiatus of the debt crisis. Regional development banks
have also taken over some of its work, notably in Asia and Latin America.
In 1993, the net external financing of developing countries was Dollars
170bn (see table). But the net disbursements of the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, commercial arm of the World Bank, were a
mere Dollars 2.3bn in the financial year ending June 1993 and negative, at
minus Dollars 0.7bn, the following year. Even soft-lending from the
International Development Association was only Dollars 4.6bn (net) in
financial year 1993 and Dollars 5.1bn the next year. The bank has become a
marginal provider of development finance.
These profound changes in the global environment have hardly gone unnoticed.
Senior managers of the World Bank are engaged in a vigorous debate over
whether theirs is a 'sunrise' or a 'sunset' institution. The IMF, too, is
debating its future, if rather more circumspectly. Yet the explosion of
global financial activity, albeit the most important, is far from the only
development with which the two institutions have to grapple. There are at
least six more.
The first is the end of the cold war. The institutions now have some 20 new
clients engaged in making the transformation from planned economies to the
free market. However, they can also no longer count for support on people
concerned about geo-strategic competition with the former Soviet Union.
The second is changes in what the main shareholders demand. The IMF has
recently come under formidable pressure to relax conditionality - the
imposition of economic policies in return for finance - for some borrowers,
notably Russia. The pressure on the World Bank is rather to adopt quotas for
increased lending to social sectors. Both institutions, but particularly the
World Bank, are also being told to become more cost-effective.
The third is the development record. A friendly critic would conclude from
the chart that development has worked, above all in east Asia. An informed
critic would know that these countries have best conformed to the
'Washington consensus' of fiscal conservatism, outward-orientation and
reliance on market forces.
Those on the anti-market left argue, instead, that the twin institutions
bear most blame for what has gone wrong in Latin America, the Middle East
and Africa. Meanwhile, critics on the market-liberal right conclude, more
plausibly, that, since they have been associated with failures as much as
with success, the Bretton Woods twins cannot make a decisive difference.
The fourth issue is the record of the institutions. Their prestige depends
on the perception that they know what they are doing, but they have made big
blunders. They encouraged much of the lending that led to the third-world
debt crisis; they failed to foresee the energy-price collapse of the
mid-1980s; they have supported incompetent and corrupt regimes; the World
Bank ignored the environment for too long, while some of its project lending
proved misguided; and many countries helped by the IMF have returned to its
trough again and again.
The fifth is ideological changes. Leftist hostility to the market economy
has become venomously focused on the Bretton Woods institutions. The left's
commitment to more participation also creates a profound suspicion of
governmental structures, shared by the market-oriented right, with its
demand for reliance on markets. So now the left is pursuing its '50 years is
enough campaign', while Lady Thatcher's former economic adviser, Sir Alan
Walters, argues that 'the ideal solution would be to abolish the Fund and
the Bank'1.
The last is the questioning of the institutions' professional competence.
Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University, for example, argues the IMF's
approach to stabilisation in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union has
been inappropriate, because it fails to understand the economic consequences
of the state's political bankruptcy.
How can these institutions best respond to the many challenges they
confront? The central necessity is to define and defend their core tasks in
ways that respond to justified demands and resist unjustified ones; the
subsidiary need is to execute those tasks as efficiently as possible. The
institutions' basic operational role can best be defined as helping those
economies unable, at present, to prosper in the global market system. They
must complement the global market economy, not substitute for it.
Countries that need these institutions' help are:
the least successful developing countries, notably those in sub-Saharan
Africa;
relatively dynamic countries such as Indonesia that remain poor and need to
achieve large institutional changes;
countries engaged in the switch from state planning to the market economy,
mainly the former Soviet empire and, in its own way, China;
and countries that fall into the hands of incompetent populist governments
or suffer large adverse shocks.
As a country prospers, however, and improves links to the global economy,
and as more of its investment is carried out by entities with access to
global capital markets, the operational role of these institutions should
disappear, as in western Europe. Balance of payments problems can then be
managed through the international capital markets.
The IMF's focus is on shorter-term macro-economic problems, while the World
Bank's is on longer-term structural difficulties. Given the different time
horizons and relationships involved, the two institutions should not be
merged, as some suggest. In addition, the IMF has a useful role vis a vis
industrial countries and, as important, is accustomed to imposing relatively
tough conditionality. The customary criticism is that it is too tough. But
critics fail to realise that its clients would have to make still more
savage cuts in spending without it. Beggars have few choices.
Being mainly restricted to the worst-managed developing countries is a
painfully circumscribed role for the IMF. Many argue, instead, that it
should play a central role in the formal management of exchange rates. The
independent Bretton Woods Commission - under the leadership of Paul Volcker,
former chairman of the Federal Reserve - has recommended that 'the
governments of the major industrial countries should give a high priority to
international monetary reforms aimed at reducing large exchange rate
fluctuations and serious misalignments'2.
If the IMF were to calculate target zones for exchange rates, it would gain
a more central role in the world monetary system than ever before. But the
IMF's major shareholders are unlikely to agree to this, as Mr Lloyd Bentsen,
US secretary of the Treasury, indicated in Monday's FT.
Today, the IMF's managing director attends discussions of the Group of Seven
leading industrial countries, but has no voice in decisions on exchange
rates. That is how things are likely to remain. For the foreseeable future,
the IMF's relations with major industrial countries will depend on its
surveillance discussions with countries, whose effectiveness is questioned
even among the staff. While the Fund might yet be needed to help with public
debt crises in industrial countries, that would indicate serious policy
failures.
For the World Bank as well, longer-term prospects are not all that bright.
The fear within it is that lending will move from stagnation to outright
decline, as its clientele is gradually restricted to south Asia and Africa.
Just as the IMF hopes for a role in exchange-rate co-ordination, some in the
bank dream of a consultative role in countries that do not need its funds.
But that would be a remarkable departure for an organisation that has
depended on mixing subsidised finance with its recommendations.
How well are the IMF and bank set up to do their core jobs? In the IMF's
case, questions about the quality of its advice are legitimate. Arguments
for greater transparency and wider use of outside economists are strong.
More important is a sharper focus on the underlying disease, which lies
almost always in the functioning of the state.
For its part, the World Bank has published a list of the six principles it
has derived from its experience - selectivity, partnership, client
orientation, results orientation, cost effectiveness and financial
integrity3. It also defines its objectives as the pursuit of economic
reforms that promote broad-based growth and reduce poverty, investment in
people, protection of the environment, stimulation of the private sector and
reorientation of governments on the tasks only they can do. Finally, it is
undertaking a re-engineering of its internal management processes, to make
itself more efficient, more responsive and more flexible. Yet the goals
hardly look selective and the six principles are little short of banal. As
for the managerial changes, they will be difficult to achieve, however
desirable.
The core functions of the Fund and World Bank are not, of course, their only
ones. Both provide valuable analyses of global economic trends and undertake
useful research and analysis. Both must also retain a flexible capacity to
respond to unforeseen events. Nonetheless, the fundamental job of the
Bretton Woods twins is to do themselves out of one. How will they reach this
goal? By insisting firmly on performance from those who depend upon them.
'Tough love' is what they must provide. If they do so successfully, their
operations ought to have largely faded into history by the time their
centenary is celebrated in 2044.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is rapidly taking
on a Marie Celeste quality, with crew deserting a captainless ship.
Some asbestos has been discovered in the Paris think-tank's main building.
Employees were given the chance to take yesterday and today off, while
experts evaluated the risk. Most shot out of the building like corks out of
Bollinger bottles: 'You should have seen the number of chain-smoking
Frenchmen haring out of here on the off-chance of a millionth part of
asbestos in the air,' said a non-French staffer.
Staffan Sohlman, Sweden's OECD envoy and acting head of the organisation,
was already a safe 400km away in Strasbourg. There he made the implausible
claim that OECD countries are deadlocked over selecting a new leader because
'they care for the organisation'.
Observer detects a parallel with the European Commission's famous cruciform
Berlaymont building in Brussels. Its closure in 1991 - also for asbestos
removal - came just before all the rows over Maastricht.

The George V in Paris (a jewel in the Forte crown) beat the Savoy as best

go to court to try to stop him.
He generally wins and has just recouped Pounds 14,000 for the costs his

Hornchurch, Essex. Indeed, he is thinking of naming his next pub the Good

Guyana's foreign debt of Dollars 2,333 per citizen is pretty steep, much
worse than that of some more notorious South American mega-debtors. So
imagine the horror of Guyanese government officials when new figures put the
total debt at 50 per cent more than last year's Dollars 2.1bn.
Calculators were produced; sighs of relief followed. The extra red ink was a
mathematical error. It 'occurred on the exchange calculations made by the
accountant general for loans denominated in Japanese yen and Italian lira',
says Ashni Singh, acting auditor general.
Asgar Ally, the embarrassed finance minister, sheepishly blamed Anand
Goolsarran, the auditor general, saying Goolsarran ignored ministerial
advice and submitted the figures to parliament before they were
double-checked. No comment from Goolsarran, who's abroad somewhere. Hope he
checks his change, wherever he is . . .

FT  07 OCT 94 / Observer: Gunning for voters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazilians are rightly proud of the smooth way their biggest set of
elections in 40 years was staged on Monday. But voters in the poor,
north-eastern state of Paraiba may have less to celebrate.
With about a third of the votes counted, ex-governor Ronaldo Cunha Lima is
almost certain to get a senate seat. This is a little unfortunate. Last year
he tried to assassinate his principal political rival. The victim survived
and Cunha Lima was charged with attempted murder.
But justice grinds slow in Paraiba. By winning a senate seat, Cunha Lima
gains immunity from prosecution under Brazil's arcane laws protecting
legislators.
Paraiba's second choice for the senate - Humberto Lucena - had his
candidature cancelled by election authorities, for illegally using senate

FT  07 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Free the Post Office
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It speaks volumes for the vanishing ideological divide in British politics
that the foremost policy difference between the main parties appears to be
the issue of privatising the Post Office. Yet if the postal service is to be
a final triumph for state industrial ownership in the UK, it cannot continue
in its current form.
For all Mr Tony Blair's resolution to ditch the Labour party's notorious
constitutional commitment to public ownership, Labour is set to fight the
privatisation of the Post Office tooth and nail. Its stance is nonsensical
since all the supposed benefits of state ownership - such as universal
service and a single stamp price across the country - could be secured
through regulation, while consumers stand to gain from the greater
efficiency and entrepreneurial zeal likely to flow from selling a majority
stake in the Post Office to the private sector.
Yet Labour's success in whipping up popular sentiment against postal
privatisation appears to be alarming enough Tory MPs to cause the government
to pause. If the cabinet feels forced by political pressure to retreat, it
should not be content with preserving the status quo. Instead it should take
Labour at its word and propose legislation restructuring the Post Office to
give it maximum commercial freedom within the public sector. Unless it does
so, Britain's highly successful postal service will be handicapped as it
seeks to expand into new technologies and confront international
competition.
Listed company
Such a policy would turn the Post Office into a stock market listed company
in which the state owned, say, 80 per cent of the shares and exercised only
the customary rights of a shareholder to agree broad strategy, approve
directors and receive dividends. It would involve taking on the Treasury
theologians who claim that no state-owned industry should be excluded from
the public sector borrowing requirement and be treated as a normal company
free from detailed Treasury control over budgets and borrowing.
The Treasury justifies its stance by citing rules on the compilation of the
public accounts, and by arguing that a public sector company could not, in
practice, be allowed to float free while the government acted as ultimate
guarantor for its debts.
Both the rules and the argument about debt are well-founded as a general
approach to state ownership. However, there are good reasons for relaxing
them in the case of the Post Office, which has long operated as a profitable
business. If the Post Office were a listed company forbidden by its founding
statute from receiving state aid, it would in practice be subject to normal
market disciplines and its borrowings could be excluded from the public
accounts.
Market discipline
The sale of a minority stake would be sufficient to ensure market
discipline, while the creation of an equity base would leave the company
free to contract business alliances and provide market incentives for its
managers and employees. In extremis, of course, the government might seek to
amend the law to provide aid; but there is nothing to stop it doing so in
the case of any private sector company.
Two key issues would still remain: regulation and competition.
Essential to a new regime would be the establishment of a regulator
operating at arm's length from the Department of Trade and Industry, akin to
the existing privatised utility regulators. The regulator, not the
government, would determine stamp prices and rates of return for the Post
Office, subject to statutory requirements to protect universal service and
other socially desirable objectives.
On competition, there is a strong case for a gradual lowering of the
existing ban on rival deliverers of mail stamped at below Pounds 1 an item.
This would encourage more specialised delivery services catering for the
business and high-value residential market without endangering the Royal
Mail.
Sweden - where the post office remains in the public sector - has gone
further, exposing basic letter delivery to full competition. That is an
example which the UK would do well to study, and if it works, follow.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Opportunity to agree broadcasting
ground rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBIN FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The recent debate concerning the emergence of powerful, vertically
integrated satellite broadcasters has left unresolved the important issue of
how best to ensure that ownership by those broadcasters of conditional
access systems (the 'gateways') does not prevent or distort competition
between satellite television channels.
The answer in our view is not to prohibit vertical integration, but to
establish a clear regulatory framework which would ensure that all channel
providers can obtain access to conditional access systems on reasonable and
non-discriminatory terms, and that an effective mechanism existed for the
speedy resolution of any disputes.
The aim must be to encourage broadcasters to invest in new systems, while
ensuring that a wide range of new television services is available at a
reasonable cost to viewers.
Unfortunately, the voluntary code of conduct put forward by the European
digital video broadcasting project does not safeguard the public interest in
this way. It provides little comfort to broadcasters that they will be
treated fairly, nor does it contain an adequate arbitration procedure. An
effective regulatory framework would, as a minimum, require the provision of
full information on access terms, backed up by transparent accounting and
indicative published tariffs. Channels provided by conditional access system
operators should be subject to the same terms and conditions of access as
those applied to similar types of channels offered by other broadcasters.
Regulation would also need to incorporate an effective disputes procedure.
Reporting abuses of the code to existing competition authorities, with the
costs and delays implied, is inadequate given the importance of rapid market
entry in developing satellite markets. Neither is it clear that any other
regulator at present has the remit or the capacity to deal with such
disputes in an effective and timely manner.
For this reason, while the BBC agrees that an 'ill-thought-out layer'
('Scrambled layer', October 4) of additional regulation should be avoided,
we do believe that a clear and enforceable framework is essential for the
future development of competition in European digital television markets. As
standards for digital television in Europe are being finalised, an important
opportunity exists for new ground rules to be agreed.

Sir, So Michael Holman feels patronised by what he calls the language of
medical correctness ('Save me from Health-speak', October 1). Perhaps he can
appreciate something of how people with cerebral palsy feel when they are
derided as spastic, a word which has become a term of abuse since The
Spastics Society was founded in 1952.
He may want to laugh when he hears we are changing our name to Scope, and
wonders why we didn't choose the more descriptive 'Cerebral Palsy Society'.
However, we should point out that the demand for change, and the new name,
came not from public relations people, but from people with cp and their
families.
The trouble with very descriptive names is that they are also very limiting.
We agree with Michael Holman that you cannot change reality merely by
changing words. However, the word 'spastic' in our name stops people coming
to us for support, particularly young families. We want to help change
reality for disabled people and we do not want words to get in the way.

FT  07 OCT 94 / In sickness, or wealth: Mergers and cost cutting in US
healthcare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The consolidation of the US healthcare industry is continuing, despite the
failure last month of President Bill Clinton's proposed healthcare reform
legislation.
This week's acquisition by Columbia/HCA Healthcare, the biggest hospitals
group in the US, of HealthTrust, owner of the second-largest hospital chain,
is part of a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the industry. There were 51
US healthcare mergers and acquisitions in the first six months of 1994
alone, according to KPMG, the accountants.
It is also the third takeover by Columbia in 15 months, transforming the
Texas-based group from a company owning 23 hospitals to one with 311 and
almost 5 per cent of the hospital beds in the US.
Other recent deals have included acquisitions worth Dollars 765m by the
Tennessee hospital group, OrNda, the purchase of 47 psychiatric hospitals
for Dollars 200m by Charter Medical of Georgia, and the sale by California's
National Medical Enterprises of 28 rehabilitation hospitals and 45
outpatient centres to Healthsouth Rehabilitation of Alabama for more than
Dollars 300m.
The upheaval is not confined to hospitals. Health insurers are merging. Wall
Street financiers are building empires in residential care for the elderly.
Surgery departments are offering cut-price heart bypass operations. The
legendary salaries of US doctors are under attack. Ambulance companies are
being touted as the next big merger area.
This is happening without the intervention of Washington. President Clinton
has postponed plans for healthcare reform to next year. But the healthcare
industry is continuing to change rapidly, largely in pursuit of lower costs.
At stake is the Dollars 600bn a year of revenue paid to US hospitals,
nursing homes and doctors. This is 9 per cent of GDP and more than most
European countries spend on their entire health services.
The main reason for the high costs is inefficiency, says Mr Eran Broshy, a
vice-president of Boston Consulting Group in New York. 'There are 35 to 40
per cent too many beds in America,' he says. 'Hospital groups must get
bigger to make sure they get business with eventually perhaps only three to
five groups per large metropolitan area.'
Overcapacity in other industries would quickly lead to price cuts. But this
has only just begun to happen in healthcare where prices allow hospitals to
make a profit with only 40 per cent of beds occupied.
Pressures for mergers date from the 1980s when employers began a drive to
cut the cost of healthcare insurance for their employees. It started on the
west coast, with employers contracting with 'health management
organisations' (HMOs) to negotiate cost-cutting deals with doctors and
hospitals.
The success of this 'managed care' in controlling costs soon attracted the
attention of the health insurers, which adopted a similar approach.
In some parts of the US, managed care has had a dramatic effect on costs. In
Minnesota, about one-third of the population is now treated under managed
health programmes. Largely as a consequence, the city of Minneapolis-St Paul
in Minnesota has lost more than 40 per cent of its hospital beds over a
decade.
In more conservative eastern regions such as New York and North Carolina,
managed care reaches only between 5 and 15 per cent of people. As a result,
the number of hospital beds in, for example, New York has fallen by less
than 5 per cent in the last 10 years.
This feeds directly through to costs. The annual per capita cost of
healthcare in California is now about Dollars 1,900 compared with Dollars
2,200 in New York, according to Boston Consulting.
Managed care changes the nature of competition between hospitals, says Mr
George Halvorson, former chief executive of Minnesota HMO HealthPartners.
Rival hospitals used to compete to buy the latest high-technology services
and eminent doctors. This encouraged them to perform as many treatments as
possible to cover the costs.
Companies such as Columbia try to eliminate duplication of overheads and
services in nearby hospitals. Mr Richard Scott, the chief executive officer,
estimates annual savings of Dollars 125m from the latest merger alone.
Large hospital groups can also make use of their increased buying power.
Even before yesterday's deal, Columbia/HCA's renegotiation of supply
contracts had yielded savings of Dollars 60m a year.
Doctors' practices are also merging to cut duplication and increase buying
power. Wall Street private investment firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson and Stowe
is one of several groups that acquire doctors' practices and merge them.
As well as bringing economies of scale, mergers help in controlling the
costs of treatment. Larger groups can build up statistical databases on
doctors' prescribing and referral habits. Doctors who require significantly
more overnight hospital stays for their patients than average, or who
prescribe too many expensive drugs, are asked to change their habits.
'We want to see fewer days of hospital stay per thousand of population,'
says Mr James Hoover, a partner in the firm.
Among the victims of these changes are hospital doctors whose fees are being
closely scrutinised along with other costs. Bellevue hospital in New York,
for example, this summer signed a deal with the Prudential insurance company
to do between 100 and 150 heart bypass operations a year on the insurer's
policyholders. Prudential is paying a flat fee of less than Dollars 35,000
per operation instead of being billed the sum of fees from staff and
materials that would typically be twice as high. The doctors at Bellevue
receive a proportion of the fees earned, less per operation than when they
billed for services.
This flat-rate fee system can be extended to cover all medical needs. For a
flat fee per head, called a capitation payment, a hospital agrees to look
after all the hospital needs of a group of people.
One example of this approach is the agreement made in July by a
Florida-based health management organisation, Physicians Corporation of
America, with the Los Angeles-based hospital company Salick Health Care. In
return for an annual per capita fee, the 319,000 members of PCA's schemes
receive comprehensive cancer coverage.
It is now in Salick's interest not to treat people unnecessarily and to
introduce preventative healthcare to cut the proportion of members likely to
suffer from cancer.
The use of capitation fees to pay for healthcare is growing throughout the
advanced economies. The UK government, for example, allocates resources to
the National Health Service largely on a per capita basis.
The trend towards payment for healthcare through capitation fees is likely
to continue in the US, forcing further moves to save costs in the industry.
With it, the wave of mergers and acquisitions looks set to continue.

<BYLINE>
   From Mr DANIEL RIFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a native New Englander who has favoured yours over American
financial papers, I was horrified to find an incident of grievous geographic
neglect. Someone had reversed the labels of New Hampshire and Vermont on the
illustration accompanying the article 'Sainsbury makes a second US foray'
(October 4). This may seem a minor gaffe, or even irrelevant. I would argue
otherwise. Having been raised in the right-hand state, the one that stands
upright and has consistently exhibited sound rightward-leaning,
market-minded thinking, I cannot ignore such a blunder.
New Hampshire, on (and in) the right in these so many ways, is home to
America's first primary every four years. In it reside some of the nation's
most libertarian thinkers and entrepreneurs. To its left, in Vermont, dwell
ageing hippies and such environmentally conscious companies as Ben &amp; Jerry's
ice cream. It is quite likely that Vermonters read neither your paper, nor
much of anything that displays support of free markets. Their single
representative is the Congress's sole avowed socialist. Disparagement
towards them, both in your geographic sleight and my own sweeping critiques,
is deserved. If only the other victim were not my dear and beloved home.

Sir, Surely the suggestion that banks should automatically make provision
for new loans being granted does not make sense ('Plan to smooth bank
profits endorsed by top supervisor', October 1). Banks should either require
increased margins or, if that proved impossible for market reasons, quit
lending altogether until reduced supply pushes margins up again. Automatic
provisions would merely be an acknowledgement of the inability of banks to
price credit risk correctly.

expectation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHARLES BUCHET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The two items appearing in the FT on Credit Lyonnais's announcement of
'bad results' translate attendre as 'to wait for' ('Credit Lyonnais goes to
the people' and 'Observer: The laughing bank', September 30). Although this
may be the meaning that first comes to mind, context leads to a different
understanding. The verb attendre also means 'to expect', eg 'Je vous attends
a neuf heures' is 'I'll be expecting you at nine'. In fact, there is no
other way to say 'to expect', except by using the same word in the more
cumbersome reflexive s'attendre a. This would have produced the somewhat
leaden headline: 'Voici les mauvais resultats auquels tout le monde
s'attend' rather than the headline cited from Le Monde of 'Voici les mauvais
resultats que tout le monde attendait'.
No wonder the latest public relations effort by Credit Lyonnais raised a
hoot from Observer. I think you will agree, however, that 'Here are the bad
results which everyone has been expecting' does not have the same piquant.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Echoes of Tory voices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The attractive face of conservatism was presented at the Labour conference
in Blackpool this week. We may see its unattractive face on display at the
Tory conference in Bournemouth next week. This has nothing to do with
personalities. Mr John Major is no less decent than Mr Tony Blair, but, as
to policy, the prime minister is constrained by circumstance. He has little
choice but to trundle along the ideological tram-lines set in the later
1980s. The leader of the opposition is free to try to tug his party towards
the gentler form of conservatism that better suits the English temperament.
He calls it social-ism, but its values have often been prescribed by Tories
from Disraeli onwards. My primary text today is therefore not the stunning
speech delivered by Mr Blair on Tuesday, evocative as that may be. It is,
rather, The Right Approach, a statement of Conservative aims agreed in 1976
by a conclave representative of all wings of the party, with the 'wets', as
they were called, predominant. The resulting document constituted the
intellectual inheritance of the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher, a new, young,
energetic leader of the opposition. 'It is the task of the Conservative
party today to restore hope and confidence to a disillusioned British
people,' the authors began, nearly two decades before Mr Blair's 'we meet in
a spirit of hope'.
Some readers may remember the 1976 paper as an assertion of rightwing
hard-headedness, and a rejection of the corporatism of the later Heath
years. It does not read like that today. It notes that Tories 'are not
blinkered by a socialist ideology that assumes the omni-competence of the
state . . .', a claim that Mr Blair might make on behalf of 'new Labour'.
More helpfully for my thesis, The Right Approach states that 'man is both an
individual and a social being'. If all society had to do was provide a
framework of laws within which individual opportunities could flourish, the
paper acknowledged, then other things in which Conservatives believed -
patriotism, loyalty, duty - would be meaningless.
The corollary is clear. 'Man is an individual, answerable to himself,' as
our pre-feminist authors put it. 'But he is also a citizen, the member of a
complex network of small communities which go to make up society - family,
neighbourhood, church, voluntary organisation, workplace and so on.' There
you have it. The essence of The Right Approach is compatible with what Mr
Blair had to say on Tuesday. 'It is not this or that minister that is to
blame,' he told the Labour conference, 'it is an entire set of political
values that is wrong. They fail because they fail to understand that a
nation, like a community, must work together in order for individuals within
it to succeed.'
Zip back to 1976. 'What we have to set out, and it is in the main stream of
Conservatism . . . ,' our social Tories wrote, 'is a political philosophy
that goes beyond the state and the individual, and begins to express in
human terms the complex network of reciprocal rights and duties in an
orderly society.' I do not propose to stretch this piece of elastic further
than it can stand. The Right Approach is echoed by Mr Blair in many places,
including the passage in which it calls for devolution of legislative powers
to Scotland, but much of it is dated, suitable to the preoccupations of the
1970s. Large chunks of it would stick in the gullet of even the most
modernist Labour leader. The point, described by Mr Blair as 'fundamental',
is that today's Conservative ministry has trapped itself on the shores of
free-market minimalism, which is not where the electorate could have
imagined it was heading when it fled from socialism and trade union thuggery
in 1979 and not where it wants to be stranded today.
Some voters may have been influenced by a second Tory paper, The Right
Approach to the Economy, which was prepared under the chairmanship of the
then Sir Geoffrey Howe. It is sharper, less 'wet' than its predecessor of
the similar name, but its principal begetter, now Lord Howe, might not
wholly disagree with my theme. 'No turning back,' he has said, referring to
the Conservative hard-right, 'should not be mistaken for bash on
regardless.' He will doubtless repeat the sentiment at next week's
conference in Bournemouth.
The way Mr Blair sees it, we are at a turning point in political history,
just as we were in 1979. The party that took office then may have won the
three subsequent elections, but the adventure upon which it led the nation
has run its course. His story-line is that we are now ready for a different
administration, whose social and political strategies are based on the
proposition that the individual and the community are mutually supportive.
There has to be a 'constructive voluntary partnership' between government
and industry. Oops] Sorry. Took that last sentence from The Right Approach,
not Mr Blair, but either will do.
If there are doubts, they lie not in the nuances of philosophy, but in the
pitfalls that await anyone who has to learn on the job. Mr Blair has been
leader for less than 80 days, so judgments of his managerial abilities must
be premature. He and his team are adept at caressing the media, and he
appears to have cemented a useful working relationship with his deputy, Mr
John Prescott. It is not, however, clear that he has found time to soothe
the sensibilities of all his senior colleagues; perhaps, as Labour's last
best hope, he has no need to.
His assistants and advisers are untested in battle. Many of them are
outstandingly intelligent, bright and very young. As head of policy, the
29-year-old Mr David Miliband will be in charge of an apparently more
formidable team than any available to previous Labour leaders of the
opposition. Most of its members, like others in the Blair entourage, are
20-somethings or just-turned 30s. These cherubim will have to produce the
Labour version of The Right Approach. They will be expected to outplay Mr
Major's policy unit, headed by Mrs Sarah Hogg, plus half Conservative
central office and an army of civil servants whose advice is never
party-political but always helpful. Yet the young are powered by optimism.
It is the Tories who have to explain why, having been in office so long,
they should be given another lease.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Arts: Tallis Scholars reach the masses - Richard Fairman
hears works by two very different early music composers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Earlier this year the Tallis Scholars took their Palestrina to Rome. Below
the golden renaissance ceiling of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore the
group had been invited to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Palestrina's
death at the heart of the city where he lived and composed.
This was not a private occasion: Gimell, the company set up as the recording
arm of the Tallis Scholars, has issued a live recording of the event on CD
and video, and plans that the video will be sold to television companies
worldwide. A follow-up concert held in the Sistine Chapel, to celebrate the
end of the cleaning of Michelangelo's 'Last Judgment', was shown live on
Italian television and subsequently broadcast in Japan.
Early music - even unaccompanied sacred music - has become big business. To
those who knew this music solely within a religious context it must be
puzzling or even disturbing to watch it being opened up to mass audiences,
researched, recorded, marketed, broadcast in the same manner as any other
public music.
Founded in 1973, the Tallis Scholars were early into the field and have
never let that advantage slip. There is no group to touch them for quality
and professionalism - least of all in Italy, where interest in the great
Italian heritage of Palestrina and even Monteverdi was long ago swept away
by enthusiasm for the Italian opera composers of the 19th century. After
Rome the Tallis Scholars have returned to London. Peter Phillips, the
group's founder, is keen to remind us that not only Palestrina but also
Lassus died in 1594 and has put together a series of concerts pairing these
two very different composers.
At the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Wednesday the first programme included
Palestrina's Missa Papae Marcelli, his most celebrated work, and Lassus's
Penitential Psalm No. 2. Setting Palestrina at his most lucidly radiant face
to face with the darker, more personal probing of Lassus - the sunlit South
of Europe opposed to the gloomy, introspective North - could hardly have
made the contrast between them more striking.
The performances, directed by Phillips, were as flawless as ever. The Tallis
Scholars' characteristic sound, bright and penetrating trained voices with
no vibrato, was accentuated by the dry acoustic of the QEH, where even the
vowels (the 'e' of 'et resurrexit') started with a kick. One way or another
there was a concentration about the singing that set it apart from the
devotional atmosphere of worship. Perhaps that is inevitable when this music
enters the public, professional arena.
The Palestrina and Lassus series continues during the winter at St. John's,
Smith Square.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Arts: Clients queue up for incentive cash - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next month the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts will
announce its estimate of corporate expenditure on arts sponsorship in the UK
in 1993-94. The figures are unlikely to show much change from the previous
year, when, for the first time in two decades, spending dropped, by 13 per
cent to Pounds 57.7m.
If the arts have managed to hold their own this will be some achievement.
Overseas, especially in the US, sponsorship has not recovered from the
recession and many arts companies are suffering badly.
In another repeat of a year ago, the arts outside London have proved more
successful in attracting support, especially from smaller companies new to
the game, while the big London flagship organisations are still finding it
difficult. The desire to see sponsorship money work, with a marketing pay
off, is growing, but corporate subscriptions to arts companies, offering
seats for the boys on the board, are harder to justify these days.
Ironically, while the overall sponsorship spend is marking time,
applications from new sponsors to the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme
are running at record levels, up to 60 a month. The government financed
scheme, operated by ABSA, has Pounds 4.8m this year with which to match the
contributions of new sponsors (with lesser deals for repeat sponsors). It
has proved an effective trigger for attracting business: in the ten years of
its existence the government has contributed around Pounds 26m while
persuading companies to give Pounds 52m to the arts.
So great is the weight of applications that the BSIS cannot satisfy
everyone, and companies currently seeking help can expect cuts of between 30
and 40 per cent in matching money. This is causing real problems: the BSIS
contribution is often built into the sponsorship, being earmarked for
advertising, or for an educational project. Sometimes sponsors make up the
BSIS shortfall; sometimes they withdraw from the sponsorship, or delay the
deal. Small sponsors giving up to Pounds 5,000 are so far unaffected.
ABSA hopes that the obvious success of the BSIS will encourage the
government to increase its funding in 1994-95: after a 7 per cent rise last
year the grant is scheduled to be frozen. Extra money will save ABSA
embarrassment, for while most applications are being scaled down, some,
including a few in the new top category of Pounds 35,000, are allowed
through. There are cries of favouritism.
ABSA obviously wants to encourage sponsors in imaginative experimental areas
avoided by play-safe companies. That is why it has just given Michelob, the
American brewer, Pounds 35,000 to raise to over Pounds 100,000 its support
for the Michelob Pioneer Programme, which enables small to medium sized
theatres to receive better funded work from visiting companies.
Among the seven venues to benefit are the Young Vic, the Traverse in
Edinburgh, and the Contact in Manchester and the companies getting much
needed additional funding from Michelob include Gloria, IOU and Phoenix
Dance.
Another sponsorship to receive the full Pounds 35,000 is the syndicate
backing the Romanian National Opera which is currently touring the UK. While
most of the Pounds 2m funding has come from a mysterious Romanian
multi-millionaire, around Pounds 200,000 was raised by companies with an
interest in Romania, like East Coast Travel, Shell Romania, Price Waterhouse
Romania, etc.
The aim is to perpetuate the package, with the sponsors continuing to help
the opera company on its return to Bucharest, forming, in effect, a nascent
ABSA-Romania, a concept dear to the heart of ABSA's director, Colin Tweedy.
There may be good reasons for ABSA's generosity in these cases, but in the
small and gossipy world of sponsorship they have aroused some bitterness,
especially the award to a foreign arts company. The fact that Paul Hudson,
who heads the BSIS at ABSA, visited Romania before the grant was made has
not helped.
The Tricycle Theatre's 'Pay What You Can' scheme has been saved by Loot,
appropriately enough. For the last four years on Monday nights and Saturday
matinees, the unemployed, students, disabled, and the old could see a show
at this north London theatre for as much, or as little, as they wanted to
pay: a penny would get you in.
The idea brought a new and needy audience to the theatre, and was copied by
Contact in Manchester and, just recently, by Battersea Arts in London, but
was proving costly in an era of frozen grants. On average the contribution
at the door was Pounds 2.25, well down on the average ticket price of Pounds
7.
But Loot, London's free advertising newspaper, is making up the difference
for the next year at a cost of around Pounds 9,000. This is its first
sponsorship, but its offices are nearby and there is a natural link between
free advertisements and free access.
A series of six lunch time concerts of 20th century British music in City
churches may not look ground-breaking, but the fact that they are backed by
the HSBC with around Pounds 40,000 (plus Pounds 25,000 from the BSIS) is
important. HSBC, better known as the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank, acquirer of
the Midland, rivals Glaxo as the UK's second largest company. It has never
got into sponsorship before but wants to promote its new identity. Its
commitment will grow. The concerts are free, involve the City of London
Sinfonia, and contain three new works commissioned by HSBC. The next will be
on November 9 at St Katherine Cree.
CEREC reports that 61 per cent of arts organisations would currently accept
tobacco brand sponsorship, but few actively seek it . . . The Visual Arts UK
Festival, to be held in the northern region, has attracted over Pounds
50,000 in sponsorship from Air UK which will act as official airline, fly in
artists, and carry the Visual Arts UK logo on its aircraft . . . BP is
renewing its Pounds 100,000 a year support for the Portrait Award at the
National Portrait Gallery until 1997 with an option until 1999 . . . the
National Trust has attracted Pounds 1m partnership support from the Rover
Group.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Arts: Goldoni at full tilt - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN SHUTTLEWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Bogdanov's production transfers from The Swan at Stratford with his
most frustrating hallmark intact; a keen and often audacious grasp of the
big picture coupled with a tendency to let individual details slip sloppily
by and undermine his overall vision.
Two hundred years ago Carlo Goldoni's The Venetian Twins was the first
commedia dell'arte play successfully to be staged with the actors neither
wearing masks nor improvising freely among the basic scenario, but following
a set script.
For the most part Bogdanov goes full tilt for the commedia flavour,
modulated for modern sensibilities after the example of Dario Fo. Actors do
not just soliloquise at, but banter and interact with the audience -
culminating in a sequence in which a supposedly hapless punter in the front
row is accidentally stabbed during a duel, cueing a stage invasion by
police, ambulancemen and even a couple of curious actors from the show in
the Pit.
Audience contact is aided by Bogdanov and designer Kendra Ullart's solution
to recreating the intimacy of the smaller Swan space: they simply sit a
couple of dozen punters on the Barbican stage, some at pavement tables of a
Veronese bar.
David Troughton is both the linchpin of these diverse frolics and the
primary source of the energy which sustains the play's central premise
through almost three hours; he plays the Twins Zanetto and Tonino, sundered
years back and both coincidentally arriving in Verona to wed their
respective beloveds.
The ensuing confusion, both romantic and financial (as one twin walks off
with the other's riches and so forth) is straight out of Plautus via The
Comedy of Errors. But Troughton, as both the Venetian roue Tonino and the
Bergmot bumpkin Zanetto, puts his back into the quick changes, slapstick and
ad libbed topical asides - perhaps too much so: on the press night, one
caught a distinct whiff of the rehearsed fluff, with Troughton deliberately
tripping over lines for the sake of another giggle.
Such excess is forgivable because he carries the show virtually single
handed. This is where Bogdanov's big idea becomes unstuck. Actors simply do
not accommodate each other's rhythms and energy levels in the way that would
elevate the production from simply nodding acknowledgment at commedia to
actually doing it.
The women in particular (Sarah Woodward and Jenny Quayle as the wives-to-be
and Sian Radinger as a supposedly feisty maidservant), make no attempt to
grab a slice of the action for themselves, but are content to be pulled
along by the action - lazy acting at the best of times, and verging on the
disastrous in such a play as this. Only James Hayes, as a deadpan Irish
manservant, carves a niche of his own to rival Troughton's towering
exuberance.
Modish contemporary sensibilities also ruin the ending. We all realise that
the death of one of the twins is merely a device to prevent the lead actor
from having to bi-locate himself during the denouement; yet, if the
resolution contains elements of potential shadow, current tastes dictate
that the darkness control be turned up to 12 if at all possible. Bogdanov,
alas, does not shirk this impulse. Consequently, as the artificial gloom
gathers at the close, the audience is left vainly trying to feel guilty
about its earlier guffaws, before growing just plain bewildered at an
allegedly grotesque, but simply gratuitous masked epilogue.
David Troughton's effervescent twin performances are indubitably worth a
look: it would have been nice if more of the production had backed him up.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Arts: Mahler, and too much more - Music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Wednesday the Barbican Hall's Mahler cycle reached the Third Symphony
(repeated last night). And very impressive it was; but it would have seemed
still better had it stood alone, instead of following two extraneous pieces
in an over-egged programme. One admired the stamina of Michael Tilson Thomas
and the London Symphony, but regretted not having more of it oneself.
Nemesis came at the quietest moment of the Adagio finale, when a solo flute
asks a tremulous question before the ultimate climax. In the hush, two women
decided that they had to leave - doubtless for the last train home: the
programme had already overrun its time half an hour - and struggled out,
clop clop clop] It was a pity, but it was inevitable.
Mahler strove regularly after an ideal, the symphony that would make a whole
concert - a whole expressive world - by itself. Here, before the unnecessary
interval we had already had two superfluous bonnes bouches. An early Brahms
set of Romantic songs, op. 17, for women's voices with pairs of harps and
horns, was entirely charming. After an elaborate re-peopling of the stage,
we heard George Benjamin's brief Jubilation, an ILEA commission from 1985
for extravagant forces including a steel band. It tickled the ear, but made
no jubilant report: some misfire there.
For the sake of these 20-odd minutes of music plus interval, we had to wait
more than an hour before the Mahler Third began. Can interval-sales at the
bar really be so important? But the symphony did begin resplendently, with
eight horns flinging out their unison challenge; and in fact Tilson Thomas
held our attention in thrall to the end.
Along with the Seventh, the Third used to be the Mahler symphony least
favoured by performances. Too wild and disparate, it was thought, and the
finale too dangerously near to kitsch; and yet it now sounds like a
mainstream masterpiece. How much our ears have changed] Tilson Thomas made
the long first movement properly overbearing and barbarous, but never
strident. The 'minuet' was artfully prinked out, the scherzo brilliantly
spring-heeled and varied.
As in the Second Symphony last week, Nathalie Stutzmann was the superb
contralto soloist, heartfelt and plangent in both the Nietzsche movement and
the Wunderhorn one with the London Symphony Chorus and the excellent
Southend Boys' Choir. And the Adagio was a tour de force: rigorously
sustained and gripping, but interpreted with a wealth of discreet, canny
freedoms. Not the most affecting performance I've heard  - but colossal,
magnificently thought through. The orchestra deserved unlimited praise.
Thursday's concert sponsored by Nikon UK Ltd.

The relationship between Frasier Crane and his hapless brother Nyles, laden
with psycho-drama even in its most banal exchanges, also happens to provide
the funniest half-hour on television. This week's Frasier (Channel 4, 10.00)
is the last in the current series: the two siblings meet over a coffee and
wonder if they are really happy. Why is it that only American sitcoms manage
to tap the comedy inherent in all great philosophical questions?
Sue Cook explores the world of the paranormal in Out of This World (BBC1,
9.30), a collection of reconstructed case histories considered by a studio
audience. Among the strange-but-perhaps-true tales is the story of the Hull

attempt on the Pope and a woman who recalls the details of a 16th century
murder.
Chlorine capers aplenty when Burt Lancaster plays a middle-aged man who

FT  07 OCT 94 / Technology: The smaller the better - Computers the size of a
sugar lump are on the way thanks to nanotechnology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine a technology that allows you to manipulate a single atom and place
it precisely in a specific position - a technology that promises to affect
virtually every aspect of our world.
Scientists exploring nanotechnology are working on a scale 500 times smaller
than today's advanced computer chips. The ability to manipulate individual
atoms would mean that a computer with more power and more memory than the
combined capacity of all the computers ever produced could be made no bigger
than a lump of sugar.
But how can scientists pick up a single atom and place it in a precise
location? Researchers believe the answer could lie in adapting the
relatively new and extremely powerful atomic force microscope. This device
uses a diamond with a single atom at its tip to take pictures of atoms based
on the electronic forces between them.
Researchers have found that when using the microscope they can also move
individual atoms. IBM's Almaden Research Laboratories in California used an
atomic force microscope to place individual xenon atoms on a nickel surface
to spell IBM.
Eric Drexler, who coined the term nanotechnology in the mid-1980s and is the
author of the book Nanosystems, believes that atomic force microscopes can
be adapted to be efficient manipulators of individual atoms.
'It will be an enabling technology if we can develop atomic force
microscopes that 'grip' an atom and not only position it but also rotate
it,' Drexler says. Current research is focused on adapting the microscope.
However, building a product atom by atom using an atomic force microscope
would be an incredibly slow process. Researchers have proposed building
molecular machines invisible to the naked eye to do the manipulating.
Ralph Merkle, a researcher in nanotechnology at the California-based Xerox
Palo Alto Research Centre, believes the potential applications are great.
'If we can create a manufacturing technology that can precisely manipulate
individual atoms, we can improve virtually every product made,' he says.
Scientists believe that the first applications for such technology are
likely to be in medicine and surgery. Molecular machines could be injected
into the body to seek out and kill diseased cells and repair delicate
organs.
Researchers also believe there will be defence applications, such as the
development of new weapons systems and lightweight hardware.
Merkle believes that nanotechnology will usher in the Diamond Age, an age as
important as Stone, Bronze, Iron and Silicon. 'Diamond is 50 times stronger
than steel, it is light, it makes an excellent semiconductor, its heat
conduction is excellent. It is the all-round ideal material,' he says.
How far away are the promises of nanotechnology? Drexler believes 'it may be
15 to 20 years away'. He adds: 'We are talking about a technology that is
inevitable, a technology that will have a greater impact than the industrial
revolution on a much shorter timescale, yet we are doing nothing to prepare
for it.'
Merkle is optimistic about development prospects: 'I don't know when we will
have these capabilities, but if you take a look at how quickly chip
manufacturers are shrinking their chip designs, and you look at the rate
that manufacturing technologies are improving their resolution, and you
consider the rate at which power consumption of individual transistors is
declining; if you chart these rates as straight lines, they all converge in
the 2010 to 2020 timeframe.'
In the meantime, nanotechnology researchers are busy designing the computers
and molecular machines that they believe will be built one day.
Nanotechnology research is being carried out by small groups of scientists
around the world. Japan recently began a 10-year, Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m)
research programme. But so far there has been no large-scale organised
effort, despite what some researchers see as its great promise.
Commercial interest is growing in the subject, and the northern California
area is emerging as a focal point for commercial and academic work.
Nanothinc, a San Francisco based company was recently formed to disseminate
information on nanotechnology and to help identify investment opportunities.
Paul Green, Nanothinc chairman, describes nanotechnology as 'the mother of
all technologies'. But right now it is a technology that is attempting the
difficult transition from the theoretical to the practical.
Eric Drexler, while optimistic about development, is also concerned about
the wider impact on trade, jobs and economies of a technology that could
make virtually any product 100 times cheaper and with a quality at least 10
times better. 'Nanotechnology is inevitable. There is no one arguing that it
won't happen. Therefore we must begin to plan on its use and how it will
change our societies.'

Swedish researchers have successfully transplanted laboratory-grown
cartilage cells into injured knees. The findings hold out hope that this
method of repairing cartilage defects could help arrest the development of
osteoarthritis.
The research, described in the New England Journal of Medicine, involved
surgically removing a small amount of each patient's healthy cartilage,
which was then grown in tissue culture. The cells were surgically put into
the patient's damaged knee.
The results of the treatment of 23 patients were described as 'highly
promising' by the research team at the University of Gothenburg's Research
Centre for Endocrinology and Metabolism and Sahlgrenska University Hospital
in Sweden.
The scientists are now collaborating with BioSurface Technology, a US
specialist in tissue engineering products, to conduct clinical studies.

More than 3m petrol buyers are expected to use the smart cards to collect
points for gifts, flights, entertainment or charities. The points, which are
stored on a microchip inside the card, can be processed by more than 1,800
electronic terminals in UK service stations.
Shell believes it is the largest retail use of smart card technology in the
country.
The cost of handling electronic transactions is expected to be far less than
processing the paper vouchers and stamps used previously.

<TEXT>
A vaccine for neutering male cats has been developed that could avoid the
trauma of surgical castration. The vaccine, which was designed by Proteus
International, a specialist in computer-aided drug design, has undergone
trials which shows that it stops sperm production and reduces testosterone
levels in tom cats.
The vaccine interferes with the action of GnRH, a hormone which stimulates
the pituitary gland to produce hormones that trigger the production of
testosterone. It uses an analogue of GnRH which stimulates an immune
response that prevents GnRH from stimulating the pituitary gland.
Further tests are being conducted to examine how long the vaccine lasts and
whether its effects can be reversed. Proteus, which is in talks with a
number of potential partners, believes its use could be extended to neuter
female cats, dogs and cattle.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Recognition for continuous
speech
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The first speech recognition system that can deal with continuous speech was
announced by Philips Electronics of the Netherlands this week. Although such
recognition systems have been available for several years, they have been
difficult to use for dictation because they relied on pauses between words.
The Philips technology depends on the recognition of phonemes, the smallest
acoustical component of a language. The system, which must be trained to the
user's voice, draws on knowledge of how words are pronounced and how
sentences are put together to recognise text.
Philips researchers in Vienna and Aachen have used the technology in a
dictation system for radiologists. The system, which has a vocabulary of
25,000 words, recognises normal speed speech and converts it into text.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Technology: Steeled for success - The Japanese are working
on cheaper and cleaner smelting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD REDHEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At NKK's Keihin steel complex on a man-made island in Tokyo Bay, nine
researchers from seven Japanese steel companies are working on a technique
they hope will produce a cheaper, cleaner and more efficient way of making
steel.
The researchers are in the penultimate year of an eight-year project
sponsored by the Japanese government to research the commercial viability of
direct iron ore smelting, which eliminates two of the most expensive and
messy parts of steel-making.
The Japanese are one step ahead of countries such as the US and Australia in
the race to commercialise the process, according to Ken Kanamori, a senior
engineer from Nippon Steel, who is leading the project. The Japanese team
say they have successfully produced pig iron at a pilot plant built next to
a conventional blast furnace NKK shut down because of recession.
In conventional processing, a standard blast furnace requires the two raw
ingredients - coking coal and iron ore - to be processed separately before
they are put into the furnace to make molten iron. Coking coal is turned
into burnable coke by baking in ovens. Raw iron ore is converted from its
powdered state into lumps in a process called sintering. The two materials
are then transferred to the blast furnace to be melted into pig iron, which
is processed into steel.
The Japanese group has removed the need for the separate coking ovens and
sinterers by building a blast furnace with two smaller furnaces attached to
the top, one above the other. The iron ore powder is poured into the top of
the structure and passes through the two small furnaces where it is sintered
using gases generated when ordinary coal, rather than coke, is put directly
into the main chamber and burned. The iron ore passes through the two
furnaces at the top and mixes with the coal in the main furnace to produce
pig iron.
'We estimate that the cost of producing steel can be cut by around 10 per
cent using this method,' Kanamori says. He adds that coking ovens and
sinterers are the biggest investment a steel company must make. Since
Japan's top five steel makers are expecting to lose a collective Y123bn
(Pounds 779m) in the six months to September they are likely to consider the
Y15bn project (75 per cent of it from the government) as money well spent.
The pilot plant produced 500 tonnes of pig iron in a trial run earlier this
year. The test used 800 tonnes of coal against the 840 tonnes of the more
expensive coking coal normally needed to produce the same amount. The team
says the pig iron can also be fed into electric arc furnaces used by
mini-mills.
Kanamori says the quality of the pig iron is almost the same as that from a
regular blast furnace. But it is likely to take at least another 10 years
before the process is able to produce steel in large enough quantities to be
commercially viable.

FT  07 OCT 94 / People: Andrew Karney quits Logica
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Logica's dramatis personae continue to change as managing director Martin
Read reshuffles his management team. Andrew Karney, corporate development
director, is the latest to exit stage right as the computing services
company's reorganisation moves on.
Karney, 52, emphasises the parting is amicable: 'New management always wants
to bring in new blood and I think that's right.' Although headhunters have
kept his telephone busy since his resignation leaked out, he says he has no
plans beyond a visit to Indonesia next month to indulge his interest in all
things Asian.
Karney was one of the earliest recruits to Logica - he joined the company in
1973; he took a special interest in telecommunications and set up the
company's joint ventures with Finsiel of Italy and with British Airways and
became a board director in 1986.
One of the founding directors of Cable London a decade ago, the new world of
multimedia seems likely to offer him fresh perspectives and challenges, but
he seems lukewarm about the prospects of starting a new company - 'Do I
really want to do that?' While he ponders his next role, his wife, Beryl
Goldwyn, is off filming an episode of 'The Bill' police series for
television.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Property: The next crusade - The quest for greater liquidity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If property is going to be taken seriously as an institutional asset class,
it will have to become more user-friendly. Fund managers would be more ready
to forgive its relatively poor performance over the past decade if property
was not so expensive and time-consuming to trade.
The biggest problem is liquidity: the costs and complexities of dealing in
commercial property look out of place judged against the standards of other
asset markets.
Although industry guidelines on transaction fees were dropped some years
ago, institutional dealing costs of 2.75 per cent for buyers and 2 per cent
for sellers barely changed.
While comparisons are difficult, dealing costs in bond and equity markets
are a fraction of this amount. If property is - like other assets - entering
a period of low investment returns, the problem will become still more
acute.
The 1 per cent agency fee paid by buyers survived recession intact, despite
the proliferation of small independent companies. Agencies have remained
reluctant to reduce their transaction fees even though charges for property
management, research and other professional services have been cut.
Some believe that a different charging policy could enhance liquidity in the
property market without reducing the profitability of companies.
'Fund managers need to wean agencies away from expecting windfall gains from
transactions, although that means appropriate fees have to be paid for other
services,' said Mr John Whalley, chairman of the Investment Property Forum,
a group set up to promote investment in property.
The growth in research and forecasting services offered by agencies is
certainly an advance. But unless transaction fees are reduced funds will not
be prepared to act on such advice.
The legal process of buying and selling property is another area of concern.
'The market has not changed its way of dealing with property for generations
and it's about time a long hard look was taken,' said Mr David Bramson, head
of property services at solicitors Nabarro Nathanson.
Relatively simple transactions can be completed within a few days. Mr
Bramson estimated that a deal involving just one title and one lease might
take 7-10 hours of lawyers' time to complete.
But bigger, more complex transactions of the type undertaken by
institutional investors take much longer. One problem is that the governing
legal principle - caveat emptor - puts the responsibility for checking
details squarely on the shoulders of the buyer.
There is certainly a view that fund managers are, as a result, too cautious.
'Investors should narrow the scope of their due diligence,' said Mr David
Hunter, head of property investment at insurer Scottish Amicable. 'Lawyers
only do what we ask them to do.'
A system of warranties - which, in effect, transferred responsibility for
gremlins back to the seller - would help speed the process. There is no
legal barrier to this way of trading.
The problem is persuading sellers to accept the lingering liability implied
by a warranty. Cautious investors could be the biggest culprits.
Warranties might also encourage the development of an electronic bulletin
board, where big investors could post details of properties they are willing
to sell. In theory, a deal identified on the board could be completed in a
matter of hours.
Again, the snag could lie with the culture of the market rather than legal
or technical barriers. A successful bulletin board would rely on a degree of
transparency and openness which many property investors find alien.
Even if the market is unwilling to accept lower transaction costs and a
streamlined legal process, there could be financial solutions to
illiquidity.
One option is turning buildings into tradeable securities - a process known
as unitisation - but this is a holy grail for many property bankers.
The menagerie of proposed securities at the end of the 1980s included Pincs
(property income certificates), Spots (single property ownership trusts) and
Sapcos (single asset property companies).
While the techniques varied, the idea was the same: to increase liquidity by
breaking lumpy assets down into smaller parts.
Some of these instruments made it to public markets. Billingsgate City
Securities, whose sole asset was the Billingsgate office complex in the City
of London, was floated in Luxembourg in 1986. The London Stock Exchange also
agreed to list Pincs, an idea devised by the securities arm of NatWest Bank
and Richard Ellis, the surveyors.
Other than the inevitable tax hurdles, the biggest problem to this type of
instrument is price. If investors are only willing to pay a discount to the
asset value, the owner would probably rather sell in the open market.
But why should investors pay more than net asset value for a small share of
a building over which they have no control?
Besides, single-building unitisation would not guarantee liquidity unless
investors were willing to trade and market-makers could be found. A small,
unwanted building would be no more liquid than before it was unitised.
Big unitised portfolios should, in theory, enjoy greater liquidity. But
property unit trusts have suffered liquidity problems of their own caused by
sudden outflows of funds. Closed-end investment trusts, with all their
assets in physical property, might provide a better solution - if only the
rules allowed.
Barclays' Property Index Certificates (Pics), launched earlier this year,
side-stepped the most common problems of unitisation by offering investors a
return linked to an index rather than an individual building or underlying
port-folio.
If more issuers can be found to add to the outstanding Pounds 150m stock of
Pics, so much the better. Similar instruments based on sectors of the market
or even geographic areas would also be possible if only indices were
developed and issuers could be found.
Yet such instruments offer something quite different from the ideal of
liquid, physical property. Having come so close to the grail at the end of
the 1980s, it could be time to start the next crusade.

FT  07 OCT 94 / People: Hardy retires from Associated
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Murdoch MacLennan, 46, group operations director of the Mirror newspaper
group, is to take over from Bert Hardy, 65, as managing director of
Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail and Evening Standard.
MacLennan, who joined the Mirror Group in 1992, is managing director of the
Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail and has been heavily involved in the
modernisation of the Mirror group's printing operations. Before joining the
Mirror, he had worked for News International and had been a director of
Associated from 1989 to 1992.
MacLennan, who takes up his new post at the end of the year, is the second
senior executive to quit the Mirror's Scottish newspapers in the past few
months. In July, Endell Laird, 60, editor-in-chief of the Daily Record,
announced that he was retiring after 35 years with the group.
Bert Hardy, who will retire after his 66th birthday, started in Fleet Street
in 1942 when at the age of 14 he became a copy boy at the Picture Post. From
there he climbed the corporate ladder to top positions, including chief
executive of the Mirror Group, News International and London's Evening
Standard.
It was during his reign at the Standard that he gained a reputation as a
fighter, when in 1987 he slashed the price of sister paper the Evening News
from 15p to 5p after Robert Maxwell's decision to cut the cost of the London
Daily News.

FT  07 OCT 94 / People: Lonrho's chair filled temporarily
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir John Leahy, the former British ambassador to South Africa, has been
appointed temporary chairman of Lonrho.
He replaces Rene Leclezio, with Lonrho for 30 years and chairman for the
past three, who in January agreed to stand down as part of a sweeping
reorganisation of the board.
Sir John, 66, and currently a vice chairman, takes up the post at the end of
the month.
Dieter Bock, the German financier who is Lonrho's joint chief executive, had
hoped to recruit an outsider to the post and had approached Eugene Anderson,
former chairman of electronics group Ferranti. However, Anderson's
appointment was opposed by Tiny Rowland, Bock's joint chief executive who,
until Bock's arrival at the beginning of last year, had been the dominant
force within the company for three decades.
Sir John is likely to remain chairman until there is a resolution of the
battle between the two chief executives for control of the company.
'Frankly, it is very difficult to recruit high quality people when there is
such uncertainty,' said a Lonrho employee.
More than a month ago, Bock's position in the company was weakened
considerably when his fellow directors forced him to abandon his plan to
propose to the board that Rowland should be stripped of his executive
powers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kevin Abbott is leaving building products group Redland after six years as a
main board director to take up a post at Bowater, the paper and packaging
company.
Abbott, 40, has been with Redland for 16 years, having joined its corporate
planning team from Schroder Wagg, the merchant bank. He was promoted to
finance director of Redland's Roof Tiles division in 1982, eventually rising
to become global roofing director and to the main board six years later.
After a reshuffle at the start of the year, he took over responsibility for
non-European building products and the UK roof tiles business.
Abbott said yesterday: 'Having grown up in one company, I thought it was
about time for a new challenge.' At Bowater he will be reunited with his
former Redland managing director David Lyon, who beat a similar path in
1987. 'I am looking forward to working again with David; he is someone for
whom I have a lot of respect.'
At Bowater, Abbott will become executive director responsible for worldwide
Health and Beauty and European packaging. He fills the spot left vacant by
Stuart Wallace, who left to join Fisons at the end of August.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Management: Leaders should learn to bow out - The need for
chief executives to develop a broader range of starring roles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has long been evident that leaders tend to outlive their usefulness as
circumstances change. Sir Winston Churchill's expiry date was the end of the
second world war. Margaret Thatcher's was the achievement of the main planks
of her radical reform programme. Mikhail Gorbachev's was the unleashing of
democracy. The nature of each leader's departure differed, but in every case
it was caused by their inability to adapt to changed conditions.
The same applies in the business world, but with a difference: that most
chairmen and chief executives quit far too late, not only when their own
performance has peaked, but when they have led their companies into
dangerous waters. Witness the belated departures in recent years of the
bosses of IBM, Kodak, Digital, Volvo and Scandinavian Airlines.
Few business leaders have the sense or humility to recognise their
limitations and leave when they have accomplished the tasks to which they
are best suited. One such rare exception was Michael Edwardes, the former
boss of British Leyland cars (now Rover), who was frank enough to admit when
he left a decade ago that if he had stayed any longer than four years his
value to the car company would have fallen by two-thirds. (His critics would
say he went before the damage he caused could be uncovered).
By contrast last week's forced resignation of David O'Brien, head of
National &amp; Provincial, a leading UK building society, was a case of a
permanent revolutionary failing to realise that although the upheaval he had
wreaked - also for four years - had benefited the organisation's performance
in the short term, it had begun to wear out its morale.
Against this litany of leaders with limited staying power can be set only a
tiny list of people who have learned to adapt their focus and style to
changing times. The arch example in the US is Jack Welch, the charismatic
chairman of General Electric since 1981.
In the UK the much quieter Sir Christopher Hogg has accomplished a similar
feat at the head of Courtaulds, leading it through four very different
phases: a battle for survival in the early 1980s; revitalisation in
international markets for the rest of the decade; revolution at the end of
it with the splitting of the company in two through de-merger; and then a
renewed battle against recession, although this time from a strong
international base.
The reasons why few leaders perform anything like as well - and for as long
 -as Welch or Hogg were studied in the late 1980s by two Canadian academics,
Henry Mintzberg and Francis Westley. They suggested that most leaders,
whether in politics or business, find it hard to adjust more than once to
what they called 'the cycle of revitalisation'. Once a new leader's first
revolution - or set of reforms - achieves its objective, a state of order
develops in which all sorts of routines are needed.
Some leaders fail to adjust even to this first shift. But if they do, they
lose the ability to launch a new revolution when the times demand it,
retreating instead into lofty distance at the top of the newly stable
system. By contrast, the one-track revolutionary who cannot adjust becomes a
restless irritant, or worse.
This analysis has now been built upon by one of Europe's leading experts on
leadership, Manfred Kets de Vries of Insead. In an article called 'CEOs also
have the Blues', published in the latest issue of European Management
Journal*, de Vries argues that chief executives, like products, go through a
life cycle. It has three phases: entry and experimentation; consolidation;
and decline. He warns that the cycle is growing shorter, to eight years or
fewer.
The heady, first honeymoon phase is usually straightforward. In it, the
chief executive's focus on just one or two themes - cost-cutting, quality,
customer service, re-engineering, takeovers or whatever - is a strength. But
in the second phase the chief executive loses the excitement of mastering
something new and settles down into the proven success formula. In
relatively stable environments this can be an advantage. But in the more
dynamic, turbulent scenes in most industries today it creates ossification,
and triggers the third phase, of decline.
De Vries attributes the whole problem to what he calls the chief executive's
'inner theatre': the sub-conscious assumptions and preoccupations, or
'scripts', as he calls them, that people acquire over time, and which
dictate their response to external stimuli. A more familiar term, used by US
academics such as MIT's Peter Senge, is 'mental maps'.
Unlike Senge and most other writers on the subject, de Vries does not advise
chief executives to attempt the unsettling process of self-renewal, in order
to become Welch-like learners. This is only feasible for some people, he
argues. Others should look for new horizons while the going is good, or
settle for the role of mentor to younger executives, he says.
But that shift in behaviour itself involves a challenging degree of personal
learning and renewal: the chief executive must foster a climate of trust and
real dialogue, and allow all existing assumptions to be challenged.
In practice, this degree of change is too great for many chief executives to
stomach.
But De Vries is right in arguing that, if they fail to regenerate themselves
in this way, they risk becoming one of what he calls the 'walking dead', and
leaving a graveyard behind them.
To extend de Vries's theatrical metaphor, most chief executives face an
uncomfortable choice. They must either recognise that they are one-act
performers, and bow out in good time, or they must learn to become all-round
artistes capable of playing the lead in an extended drama of several very
different acts.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Management: An integrated approach / A look at a consultancy
firm's ambitious plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Change management has been around a while - yet judging by a Price
Waterhouse announcement this week the idea looks to have plenty of life left
in it yet.
In a move designed to consolidate the fastest growing part of the firm's
business, the international management consultancy practice unveiled details
of a plan bringing together its previously separate strategic, operational
and information technology consulting services.
The aim of the exercise - which has cost more than Dollars 10m (Pounds 7m)
to implement over the last year - is to respond better to what PW perceives
to be a growing demand for large-scale change programmes across
organisations and across national borders. This type of activity already
accounts for about 20 per cent of the firm's fee income - from a standing
start in mid 1990 - and is said to have pulled in more than Dollars 250m of
worldwide business in the last year alone.
PW's message - that companies too often opt for piecemeal solutions and that
what they really need is a unified approach - is not exactly leading edge
stuff; it has also been promoted by KPMG and Andersen Consulting among
others. PW's reorganisation is nevertheless an indication that chief
executives are increasingly confused by the myriad of different gospels
currently being preached by the consultancy industry.
PW's approach has three main strands:
* The integration of the six 'main levers' of change - people and culture;
processes and systems; structure; technology; markets; and products and
services.
* A strong focus on securing the commitment of interested groups.
* New software to assist in identifying best practices and performing
process analysis.
Backing up its ideas PW has simultaneously published a book called 'Better
Change', claimed to be a practical guide for everyone initiating, leading,
or affected by large-scale change programmes. It sets out 15 'key
principles' which PW has gleaned from its collective experience.
* Confront reality. 'We are all highly vested in the seductive notion that
what we have built will continue to flourish.'
* Focus on strategic contexts. Knowing where to invest in change - where to
seek improved performance - will separate the victors from the vanquished.
* Summon a strong mandate. This is generally provided by top management, but
it should be amplified by the voice of the customer.
* Set scope intelligently. Focus on measurably improving performance in
areas most important to the organisation and its key stakeholders.
* Build a powerful case. You cannot assume others are prepared for change.
* Let the customer drive change. Serving customers is a powerful common
denominator in an organisation.
* Know your stakeholders. Powerful individuals and groups have stakes in
changes being contemplated.
* Communicate continuously. Clear, succinct messages will be understood.
Honest messages will be believed.
* Reshape your measures. Take the time to re-evaluate and, if necessary,
dismantle old measures.
* Use all of the levers of change. (markets and customers, product and
service offerings, the organisational structure).
* Think Big. Small thinking dominates many projects, with predictable
results.
*Leverage diversity. Women and minorities 'help to shake the old paradigms
and where necessary replace them'.
* Build skills. Over-invest in human capital.
* Plan. 'To drive change you must develop a documented and detailed action
plan for change.'
* Integrate your initiatives. 'Savvy executives strive to balance the
entrepreneurship of high-initiative managers with the need to adhere to a
focused strategy.'

FT  07 OCT 94 / Management: The first 100 days
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN MICHAELS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So now you are the boss. The board rang last night and this morning the
chief executive's office has your name on it.
Everything is in a state of flux. There is much work to do, and you know
that you have some breathing space in which to introduce change. But, as a
report in the McKinsey Quarterly* points out: 'Within 100 days or so a new
order usually gets established and things settle down again . . . periods of
transition are painfully short.'
The report's authors explore how best to use the 100 days of opportunity,
what to focus on and how not to sow the seeds of your own destruction.
'Executives . . . often focus, from the very beginning, on the kind of
legacy they want to leave behind,' the report says. The next step is to ask:
'What is the number one thing that could derail what I hope to achieve?'
This approach keeps the new boss's mind focused on a strategy.
Then managers are advised to explore power bases and communications
channels. A new chief of a US railway wanted to limit status symbols.
He replaced the ground-floor executive offices with a fitness centre. 'By
the time he announced that one-third of corporate staff would be cut, the
organisation had already gotten the message: change was real and more was
coming.'
The report advises focusing on a few outstanding themes. One rueful CEO
says: 'If everything is a priority, then nothing is a priority. It may sound
trite, but we do it to ourselves all the time. At times there seemed to be
200 'critical' things to do. Even when I pared the list down to 30 I still
felt swamped.'
Planning company successions is also crucial to long-term stability. In a
survey by The Conference Board* of companies mostly based in the US and
Europe, leadership continuity is the principal objective of succession
planning, a process formally undertaken in 61 per cent of those surveyed.
Succession programmes are used to cover a great number of posts in some
organisations. The survey says, however, that the process of tracking is
often behind the times, although many companies intend to develop more
meaningful criteria for evaluating capability.

FT  07 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: The cheerleader with a
conscience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last time Mr John Prescott gave a speech from Labour's conference
platform he made a virtuoso defence of John Smith's plans for a more
democratic party constitution.
Today he will speak from the rostrum in defence of Mr Tony Blair's plan to
rewrite the constitution's sacred Clause 4. Support for the leader from the
most important representative of the party's traditionalist wing is
critical.
Mr Prescott's election as Mr Blair's deputy in July was in part a reward for
his loyalty to Mr Smith. Since then he has shown the same loyalty to Mr
Blair.
He is not an enthusiast for the idea of tearing up Labour's historic
commitment to 'common ownership of the means of production, distribution and
exchange'. He feels uneasy about being separated from the wing of the party
he was elected to represent. But Mr Prescott understands that his support is
vital to ensure that Mr Blair wins. And he has no wish to see him lose.
So Mr Prescott will announce today that he will lead the consultation to
secure agreement on a replacement for Clause 4.
He helped Mr Blair craft the vital sections in this week's speech. And he
has been reassuring disquieted colleagues on on the left that the new
formula will include a commitment to a continuing role for public ownership.
He will be looking over Mr Blair's shoulder as the statement is drafted.
The two men are not natural political friends. They disagree over tax
policy. The Blair camp found it difficult to disguise its irritation at the
start of the week when the deputy made no secret of his belief that a Labour
government should tax the rich more heavily.
Mr Prescott is a more instinctive interventionist. He is suspicious of Mr
Blair's close relationship with Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor. He
sees himself as the guardian of the conscience of the traditionalist left.
He is not sure that Mr Blair understands fully the way the party in the
country works.
But the new leader has been careful to ensure that his deputy has been
closely involved in all the key decisions in the run-up to the conference.
Mr Brown warned Mr Blair not to go ahead with the idea of rewriting the
constitution unless he was certain of his deputy's support.
Mr Prescott has responded to his inclusion by making it clear that as long
as he remains in the inner circle he will press his case strongly in private
but will not seek publicly to undermine Mr Blair.
In today's speech he will also seek to carve out another niche - as head of
the party's campaigning drive in the run up to the general election. He will
announce a target of doubling the party membership and will promise an
overhaul of the lamentable machinery at Labour headquarters.
With a reputation as a speaker who can rouse the party's activists and a
politician who has a strongly positive image among the party's traditional
supporters, Mr Prescott intends to assume a role in the constituencies akin
to that of the Tory party chairman.
Mr Blair is said to be enthusiastic about the idea. Together the young
moderniser and the down-to-earth traditionalist make a powerful team. But
the Labour leader would be wrong to take his deputy for granted. Loyalty, Mr
Prescott has told friends, does not have to be blind.

A Labour government would introduce anti-discrimination measures backed by
law, Mr Jack Shaw, shadow environment secretary, said yesterday.
He told the conference that a bill of rights would provide people for the
first time with enforceable rights, written into the statute book.
Discrimination on grounds of race, sex, sexuality or disability would be
outlawed.
In a debate on modern democracy, Mr Straw accused the Tories of centralising
power on a previously unimagined scale.

Labour accused the government of turning one of the safest countries in the
world into a land plagued by crime. Mr Jack Shaw, shadow environment
secretary, said yesterday: 'The so-called party of law and order has turned
much of Britain into a no-go area.'
He condemned Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, over security lapses at
high security prisons, mocking his claim that they would be made 'no picnic'
for criminals.
He said: 'As the lobster thermidor lunches at Whitemoor prison showed, in
Britain's prisons today life for our notorious criminals and terrorists is
not a picnic, it's a banquet.'

planned
</HEADLINE>

Delegates yesterday approved a motion calling for the abolition of the
ancient office of Lord Chancellor and new procedures to subject the
appointment of judges and magistrates to public scrutiny.
Under its terms the Lord Chancellor and his department would be replaced by
a ministry of justice.
Mr Richard Rosser, accepting the motion on behalf of the national executive
committee, said the legal system needed to be changed to provide meaningful
rights of access to justice for the individual citizen.
Judges were attacked by delegates for being 'aged and white' and cossetted
in luxury mansions when presiding over courts outside London.
One delegate complained that the judiciary was dominated by 'privately
educated Oxbridge people who sometimes appear to come from another planet'.

defeat

Mr Tony Blair suffered his first defeat when the conference yesterday
endorsed earlier demands for the scrapping of the Trident nuclear submarine
force, Ivor Owen writes.
Constituency activists roared approval when it was announced that a card
vote had resulted in a motion condemning Trident being carried by 54.2 per
cent to 45.8 per cent.
It also called for Britain's defence expenditure to be reduced to the
average of other countries in western Europe.
Labour leaders shrugged off the defeat as a ritualistic gesture which would
not change existing policy.
A party spokesman said: 'Historically, Labour conferences have passed
motions on defence facing in different directions.'
He stressed that on Wednesday the conference approved a statement on defence
policy by the national executive committee which reflected the views of Mr
Blair.

   By IVOR OWEN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary, promised a Labour government
would increase nurses' salaries in line with the recommendations made by
their pay review body.
All the pay review bodies for National Health Service employees would be
free to make their own decisions, and the workers would get the increases
they deserved. To cheers, Mr Blunkett said: 'That is our pledge.'
Confirming that the internal market created by the present government would
be replaced with co-operation, he said this would ensure that hospitals once
again put the needs of patients first.
The 'unaccountable' self-governing NHS trusts would be abolished and
existing arrangements under which family doctors could opt to control their
own budgets replaced.
Mr Blunkett said all those involved in the primary care sector would be able
to participate in prioritising and planning as part of a 'joint
commissioning' process.
He confirmed that tobacco advertising would be banned and compulsory
competitive tendering ended.
Delegates approved a resolution which pressed for the strengthening of laws
on the licensing of medicines, and for pharmaceutical companies to be made
more accountable for their products.
Department of Health officials immediately attacked Mr Blunkett's call to
abolish NHS trusts, saying that Labour was 'deeply wedded to the old and
failed command and control doctrines'.

FT  07 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Blair flirts with tax cuts -
Plan to 'reduce burden on middle-income families' alarms soft left
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair yesterday raised the possibility that Labour could promise tax
cuts for middle-income voters at the next general election.
His comments came as close colleagues indicated that Mr Blair planned a
wide-ranging shake-up of Labour's front-bench team in the Commons after the
shadow cabinet elections later this month.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, is expected to remain in place - but
Mr Blair may well shuffle the holders of all the other principal shadow
cabinet portfolios. He is also expected to promote a number of modernisers
into important second-rank positions.
Mr Blair is determined to resist pressure from prominent leftwing figures in
the shadow cabinet to back-pedal on his pledges not to increase the tax
burden for average earners to pay for Labour's spending programme.
Mr Blair said on BBC Radio that Labour would reconnect the issue of tax
levels with the overall performance of the economy. As long as the economy
had serious structural weaknesses, the tax burden would rise.
He added that a successful economy under Labour would pave the way for
eventual reductions in tax. 'A strong economy will allow us to spend more
wisely and reduce the burden of tax on middle-income families,' he said.
But Mr Blair's stance has alarmed leading figures on the party's soft left.
They fear that by emphasising now that Labour will not put up taxes, Mr
Blair will commit the party to matching after a general election any
pre-election cuts announced by the Conservative party.
Mr John Prescott, the deputy leader, is among those determined that Labour
should keep its options open - and he has made clear that the issue will be
at the centre of the party's internal debates in the next year.
But Mr Blair has told close colleagues that it will be impossible to sustain
the party's attack on Conservative tax increases unless Labour is clear that
it will not add to the burden. One colleague said: 'It destroys the
argument. It is no use attacking the Tories for a 7 pence increase in the
basic rate if you then say you are going to bung it up by 8 pence.'
Mr Blair is said to be 'perfectly aware' that the Conservatives are likely
to test Labour's rhetoric by announcing big tax cuts before the general
election.
He intends to respond with a strategy based on the argument that any such
reductions will prove as temporary as the ones before the last general
election because of the government's failure to build the long-term strength
of the economy. One colleague said: 'We want to re-integrate the tax and
spending question with the overall state of the economy.'
More broadly, once his new shadow cabinet is in place, Mr Blair will give
priority to producing a number of statements on key policy areas to give
clarity to the change in the party's direction in Blackpool.
But he has ruled out producing a further set of detailed policy documents in
favour of 'crisp' and concise statements reflecting Labour's position on the
'policies that matter'.

FT  07 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Businesses giving delegates
the Tory treatment - Exhibition space for the 1995 Brighton conference is
almost sold out, says Roland Rudd, with companies flocking to woo Labour
supporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you are a company director sufficiently impressed by Mr Tony Blair's new
modern Labour party to want to take an exhibition stall at next year's
Labour conference you had better hurry. Most of the stands for 1995 are sold
out.
More businesses advertised at this year's Labour conference in Blackpool
than ever before. So the party's corporate affairs team raised the minimum
price from Pounds 2,500 to almost Pounds 3,000 and by Tuesday morning had
sold more than 90 per cent of available space for next year's conference in
Brighton.
Business is taking Labour seriously. And Labour is taking the business of
making money equally seriously.
Never mind that Mr Frank Dobson, transport spokesman, when speaking to the
conference likened Mr Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, to the fat
controller in Thomas the Tank Engine and said he was not up to his job. That
was just politics - Mr Dobson was telling the delegates what they wanted to
hear.
Neither side took offence. Railtrack has just booked one of the biggest
exhibition stands for next year. The company, which wants to be privatised
quickly, is keen to get its message over to as many Labour people as
possible. Ms Lorraine Satchell, Labour's exhibitions organiser, is delighted
to take its money.
Most delegates taking part in the party's transport debate spoke out against
the break-up and privatisation of British Rail. That did not deter Regional
Railways, created as a prelude to privatisation, from taking an exhibition
stand at Labour's conference.
Mr Steve Hutchinson, the company's advertising account manager, said:
'Irrespective of people's views of privatisation we wanted to position
ourselves as a well-run company.'
The same is true of Nuclear Electric, which took a double stand. Its
management has publicly asked to be privatised but decided to advertise at
the conference in spite of Labour hostility to privatisation.
Even the management of National Power and PowerGen, the electricity
generators criticised by Labour for directors' big salaries and share
options, were discretely wining and dining selected MPs in Blackpool hotels.
Some big companies have decided to advertise their businesses at a Labour
conference for the first time. Sainsbury and Tesco, the food retailers, took
prime stands and have already booked stalls for next year.
Mr Nigel Matthew, Sainsbury's group secretary, said the company had become
more aware of the importance of communicating to the big political parties.
'With Labour controlling so many more local authorities we have to be more
accessible to the party,' he said.
Mr Bernard Hughes, Tesco's corporate affairs manager, said his company
wanted to start a dialogue with Labour councillors.
The food retailers are particularly critical of the Department of the
Environment's decision to withhold future planning permission for
out-of-town supermarkets and are keen to tell Labour how many jobs will be
created from their continued expansion into the green belt.
As one food retailing manager said: 'Let's face it, with Labour likely to
form the next government its become more important than ever to talk to
Labour politicians.'
British Airways has long booked space at Labour conferences. This year it
took to advertising its club-class seats. 'This is a party full of
aspiration, so why shouldn't we be telling them about our new club-class
seats?' asked a BA spokesman.
If wanting to be treated the same as a well-heeled Tory counts as aspiration
then BA has a point.
Mr David Clark, the party's defence spokesman, last year led a revolt
against BA serving ordinary white wine at its Labour conference reception
when he discovered that the airline was offering champagne to the Tories.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, quickly got the point, and this year made
sure Labour MPs were offered the company's own blend of Piper Heidsieck
champagne reserved for first-class passengers.

FT  07 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Brown denies planning for
sterling crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday rejected suggestions in a
newspaper that he had started to plan for a sterling crisis after the next
general election.
In an interview with Tribune, a leftwing Labour weekly, Mr Brown was quoted
as saying that he was seeking agreements with the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund in advance of the general election.
The report raised the spectre of international intervention along the lines
of the 1976 economic crisis when the then Mr Denis Healey, Labour
chancellor, was forced to call on IMF help to restore currency stability.
However, Labour officials said Mr Brown's comments had been misinterpreted.
They said he was referring to the general problem of financial market
instability, and insisted that there was 'no question' of plans for an IMF
rescue package.
The Tribune article refers to the pressure on sterling that greeted the 1929
and 1964 Labour governments, and says that Mr Brown was asked 'about the
inevitable run on the pound'.
Mr Brown is quited as replying: 'We are already working on plans to tackle
the problem, should it arise. We are under no illusions.
'But we are seeking . . . new international agreements through the World
Bank and the IMF. We are doing this in advance of the next election through
our various contacts.'
Mr Brown was then asked: 'Are you saying that the speculators and the modern
gnomes of Zurich can be checked?' He responded: 'Yes, I believe they can. I
believe it can be made much more difficult for the international speculators
and gamblers.' He added: 'I really do believe we can ride that threat.'
Mr Brown's aides said he had been quoted accurately. But they said that the
possibility of a sterling crisis following the election of a Labour
government had never been put to him.
An adviser said: 'What he was asked was: 'Are you worried about the problem
of instability and speculation in financial markets, and could this be a
problem for a Labour government?''
Mr Brown, who raised the prospect of greater international co-ordination in
his conference speech on Monday, will travel to Washington next week for
talks with US officials which will include discussions on market
instability.

FT  07 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Policy to hold referendum on
PR confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday reaffirmed its commitment to hold a national referendum on
proportional representation - in spite of fears that this could divide the
party.
In a wide-ranging debate on the future of the British constitution, leftwing
activists argued that Labour should rescind a decision taken last year to
hold a referendum, claiming that this could allow the Liberal Democrats to
gain more Commons seats.
Several speakers argued that a referendum on PR would distract an incoming
Labour government from implementing its economic programme. Fears were also
expressed that PR would allow extremist groups into parliament.
However, the conference narrowly voted to stick by the resolution taken last
year which accepted the Plant Commission's recommendations on electoral
reform.
This commits Labour to supporting the current first-past-the-post system,
but concedes that the public should be allowed to express its preference for
electoral reform.
The conference also made clear its determination to abolish the large number
of quangos set up by the Conservatives, ending Tory 'patronage, sleaze and
secrecy'.
Mr Michael Meacher, shadow public service minister, said Labour would
abolish many quangos, introduce tighter controls on party funding and bring
in legislation to open up the workings of Whitehall: 'We must and will raise
standards of conduct in public life. Tory Britain today has become
Corruption Incorporated.'
On the issue of devolution, the conference defused a potential row with its
Welsh MPs by committing Labour to the creation of a Welsh assembly in its
first year of government.
In recent days, MPs from the principality had expressed concern that the
Labour leadership was leaning towards the creation of a Scottish assembly
within 12 months of taking office without making the same commitment to
Wales.
The conference yesterday voted to give equal prominence to devolution for
both regions and calling for elected regional government in England.
However, there is less certainty over the party's attitude to reform of the
House of Lords. Mr Tony Blair has said that the party would end the right of
hereditary peers to vote on laws. But the conference went much further than
this yesterday by reasserting its call for abolition of the House of Lords
and the creation of a replacement second chamber.

FT  07 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Renationalisation of rail
wins unanimous backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour will reverse the break-up of the railways and bring them back into
public ownership, Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, told the
conference yesterday.
Privatisation was 'so stupid that even Tories called it a poll tax on
wheels', he told delegates, who unanimously approved a motion calling for
renationalisation of the railways.
Mr Dobson said more than Pounds 700m had been squandered on paying City
advisers which could have been used to buy 57 InterCity trains.
He described the money paid to private consultants as the 'evil consequences
of privatisation' and pledged the next Labour government would 'reverse the
break up and privatisation of Britain's railways'.
By offering to contribute Pounds 1.7bn for the Channel tunnel high-speed
rail link to London, Mr Dobson said the government had accepted that the
link could not be built by the private sector alone. But he criticised the
proposed arrangement whereby the taxpayer contributed 60 per cent of the
costs without receiving a share of the profits.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT transport union, said a new
association of train-operating companies would be 'a cartel designed to
exploit its monopoly position to extract concessions from the government
against the interests of the passengers'.
He also criticised the role of the Health and Safety Executive in the signal
workers' dispute, saying he wanted a judicial review of their actions.

FT  07 OCT 94 / MMC cinema report welcomed by independents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Film buffs may be able to choose from a wider range of films at local
cinemas following publication of a Monopolies and Merger Commission report
on film distribution.
The report concludes that a 'complex monopoly situation' exists among a
small number of distributors and exhibitors, some of which are linked to
each other and to the Hollywood film studios, which makes it difficult for
independent cinema operators to secure popular films.
The MMC criticises the insistence by distributors that films be shown for a
'minimum exhibition period' of at least four weeks. It suggests that the
minimum period should be two weeks.
Ms Romaine Hart, management director of Mainline, which owns the three
Screen cinemas in London and two regional cinemas, said this was 'brilliant
news'.
She added: 'This should help us to be much more flexible in our
program-ming.'
Mr Robert Beeson, a director of Artificial Eye, which owns an independent
distribution company and cinema chain, said competition from big films with
long minimum runs had in the past posed problems for some of its films.
Robert Altman's Short Cuts, which came out last spring to favourable
reviews, received relatively poor distribution because cinemas were asked to
allocate long runs to Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winning Schindler's List.
The MMC criticises the practice of 'alignment' under which distributors give
first choice of their films to a particular cinema chain. Alignment was
condemned by the commission in a 1983 report, but it then concluded that the
industry was too weak for it to act.
Cinema audiences have since risen healthily and, in the new report, the MMC
recommends that alignment be abolished.
There is scepticism in the industry, however that the practice can be
stopped. Ms Hart said: 'It's all down to market forces. And there's nothing
the MMC or anyone else can do about that.'
The commission's suggestion that the industry establish a panel to consider
complaints from independent cinemas that have been refused the right to show
particular films also met a sceptical response.
Mr Beeson said: 'We're operating in a time-sensitive market. If we want to
show a film we need it immediately. There's no point in waiting for six
months for a panel to say 'Sorry. You should have had it.' By then no one
will want to see it.'

FT  07 OCT 94 / MPs to demand shake-up at CSA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A powerful committee of MPs looks set to recommend sweeping changes to the
controversial Child Support Agency in a move that would increase pressure on
the government to implement new reforms.
An early draft of the social security committee's latest report, circulated
this week to committee members, is understood to argue for changes in many
areas. These include the formula used when setting the level of maintenance
payments to be made by absentee fathers and so-called 'clean break'
settlements between divorced couples.
The draft also makes radical proposals for involving the committee in the
process of assessing any new CSA-related legislation put forward by
ministers, whether primary or secondary, before it is enacted.
If the suggestions in this area are adopted, they could set an important
precedent for the way bills are scrutinised by MPs on their passage through
parliament.
Members of the committee, which has a Conservative majority, will meet to
discuss the draft on October 19, after MPs return from the summer recess.
The final report is expected to appear by November, just in time to
influence government thinking about whether to include a CSA reform bill in
the Queen's Speech.
This is under active consideration by ministers, although the government
will probably wish to avoid primary legislation on such a controversial
topic if it can.
Ministers are keen either to be in step with the committee's recommendations
or to have convincing arguments ready to deal with the points where they are
not.
Most recommendations in the committee's first report on the CSA, published
last year, were implemented.
The draft is thought to advocate simplifying the maintenance-payment formula
along the lines of current practice in Australia and New Zealand, and to
suggest allowing assessment levels to be reduced in some cases of
'clean-break' settlements.
The current principle is that these settlements cannot be offset against
maintenance payments.
In an article published last month, Mr Frank Field, the committee's Labour
chairman, came out in favour of lower payments for parents who started
second families 'on the basis that taxpayers will look after first families'
than those who 'act knowing the CSA is in existence and here to stay'.
The draft urges better co-ordination between the CSA and the Benefits Agency
and suggests that consideration be given to the introduction of maintenance
'disregards'.
It discusses the possible introduction some form of appeals system - a move
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, cautioned against in the Commons
earlier this year.
The draft proposes that the Commons committee be asked to hold public
hearings on new CSA-related primary legislation after the bill's second
reading but before it enters standing committee. It says the committee
should be asked to hold similar hearings into any new statutory instruments
soon after they are published.

The Ministry of Agriculture will take random samples of lettuces this winter
to monitor the use of fungicides.
The move follows a report by a government working party which showed that 26
per cent of lettuces surveyed last year contained unacceptable pesticide
residues, an increase from 17 per cent the previous season. The Department
of Health has said the residues pose no risk to human health.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks are wrongly using the rules governing the capital they must allocate
to transactions with companies to determine charges, a Bank supervisor said
yesterday.
Mr David Holt, the Bank's senior manager of supervision and surveillance,
said it 'never loses the opportunity' to tell banks that capital rules were
not designed to deliver an accurate measure of risk in a single transaction.
'The banks nevertheless continue to use them for this purpose,' he said.
Rules on allocating capital to cover the risks of loans were introduced in
the 1988 Basle Accord.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The judge in the trial of Mr George Walker, the former chairman of the Brent
Walker group, yesterday warned the jury that fraud on a company was not a
'victimless' crime, John Mason writes.
Beginning his summing up, Judge Geoffrey Rivlin said the money at issue
sometimes came from shareholders, who were entitled to expect a company's
accounts to be honest.
The prosecution claims that Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former
Brent Walker finance director, fraudulently boosted the company's profits in
1984-89.
The two men deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiring to
falsify accounts. The judge's summing-up will continue until October 17.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Fleet buyers sustain car market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Car dealers yesterday called on manufacturers to stop setting 'unachievable'
sales targets.
Their call coincided with statistics showing that private buyers appear to
be deserting the new car market in growing numbers, although buoyant fleet
business is keeping it above last year's levels.
Registrations of new cars in September totalled 144,998, a 6.54 per cent
increase from the same month a year ago, according to statistics from the
Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. But registrations to private
buyers were down by 4.6 per cent compared with the previous September.
The Retail Motor Industry Federation, representing Britain's 7,000
franchised dealers, said last night: 'Consumer confidence is now a major
problem inhibiting further recovery.'
Registrations attributed to private motorists were up 3.4 per cent for the
first nine months, but the gain was entirely in the first half of the year.
Registrations by fleet buyers were up 22.3 per cent in September compared
with a year ago, bringing the fleet market increase to 16.7 per cent over
the first nine months.
This helped total new car registrations in the first nine months rise 9.48
per cent from the 1993 level. However, an overall weakening trend in the
marketplace is evident in the fact that year-on-year growth in the third
quarter was only 3.3 per cent, compared with 14 per cent in the first half.
Much of the big third-quarter weakening was accounted for by August, usually
the main buying month for private motorists, when the new 'M' plate failed
to stop registrations of 452,000 falling below the 500,000 which was widely
predicted.
Yesterday's statistics showed Ford continuing its market leadership with an
improved share of 21.66 per cent.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Minister pledges help for Tyneside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Extra measures to help rejuvenate Tyneside in the wake of a wave of recent
heavy job losses were pledged yesterday by Mr Ian Taylor, trade and
technology minister.
He announced during a visit to Newcastle upon Tyne that the government had
given the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation approval to spend Pounds
8.7m on redeveloping part of South Shields' riverside.
The Northern Development Company would be given an additional Pounds 50,000
to promote inward investment opportunities and redundant employees would be
given immediate access to Tyneside Training and Enterprise Council courses
and Employment Service programmes.
Mr Taylor confirmed the government's support, first voiced 17 months ago,
for a Tyneside enterprise zone, subject to European Commission approval, if
local people favoured it. This, he said, could benefit the region to the
tune of Pounds 40m and create a possible 5,000 jobs.
He said the government was considering proposals from the private and public
sectors to help Tyneside build on its maritime skills by moving into sub-sea
technology.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Linkmen to paramilitaries play down hopes of loyalist
ceasefire: Stewart Dalby cautions against premature expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intense speculation in Belfast that Ulster's loyalist paramilitaries will
announce their expected ceasefire within two weeks appears to be
over-optimistic.
Mr David Ervine of the Progressive Unionist Party, who is described as
having an insight into loyalist paramilitary thinking, said: 'I am confident
there will be a ceasefire. But the speculation that it will happen within
the next two weeks is unrealistic.'
The Rev Roy Magee, who is also ascribed an insight into paramilitary
thinking, agreed . He certainly speaks to the unnamed shadowy loyalist
paramilitary leaders, if not for them. Asked whether he thought there would
be a loyalist ceasefire, he said: 'Yes, but I am not sure it is imminent.
'I have been saying all along that the paramilitaries must be given time to
consult everybody. After all, it has taken nearly nine months since the
Downing Street declaration for the IRA leadership to get everyone on board.
The Protestant leaders must be given time.'
The loyalist groups made four conditions for a ceasefire:
A cessation of violence by the republican splinter group the Irish National
Liberation Army.
Evidence that the IRA ceasefire is permanent.
Conviction that there was no secret deal with the IRA.
An assurance that nothing in the framework document being drafted by the
London and Dublin governments would weaken the union with Britain.
The paramilitaries, like some of the constitutional unionists, believe that
Mr John Major, the prime minister, did not make a secret deal with the IRA.
The INLA is thought not to have the wherewithal to go against the wishes of
the bigger Provisional IRA, whose ceasefire looks more solid every day.
The sticking point is thus the framework document, being drawn up by the two
governments to lay the basis for discussion about possible cross-border
arrangements.
A problem here is that the framework document keeps disappearing over the
horizon. It was to have appeared in September, then by the end of October.
Now it seems it will not be ready until November.
Mr Ervine suggested an actual sighting of the document may not be entirely
necessary to calm loyalist fears. An assurance by the governments that the
framework document was a discussion document and not a rigid agenda might do
the trick, he said.
Mr Magee said any ceasefire would mirror that of the IRA - it would not be
declared permanent or involve handing over the considerable arsenal of
weapons the Protestant paramilitaries have been augmenting recently. As with
the IRA, a return to violence at some future date would remain on the cards.
In the past the unionist community has shown a remarkable ability to cohere
and co-ordinate resistance when it felt really threatened.
This cohesion may no longer be possible because, according to Mr Magee, the
paramilitaries have made it clear they will no longer be at the beck and
call of the constituency politicians. 'They feel they have been let down in
the past by the politicians.'
Mr Jim Rodgers, a Belfast councillor for the Ulster Unionist Party and
another man with an insight into paramilitary thinking, said that the
Protestant paramilitaries used to be regarded as less efficient than the IRA
but this has changed.
The Combined Loyalist Military Command embraces and speaks for the main
paramilitary groups - the Ulster Defence Association, which has subsumed the
Ulster Freedom Fighters, and the separate Ulster Volunteer Force.
Mr Rodgers said there were 10,000 men under arms in the joint UDA/UFF and
about 2,500 in the UVF. Others said there were about 4,000 in the UDA and
1,500 in the UVF.
Mr Magee estimated there were about 1,000 active Protestant paramilitaries.
But more important than numbers was the increasing sophistication of the
Protestants. The army confirmed that they had developed bomb-making
abilities and they also had better arms.
Mr Magee believed that in order to avoid conflict with the largely
Protestant British army or the RUC and Royal Irish Regiment, they would
target places in the Republic. The violence would therefore move south.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Irish Premier Reynolds appeals to loyalists for early
ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday appealed to loyalist
paramilitaries to declare an early ceasefire. 'While some people claim to be
preoccupied by the issue of the permanence or otherwise of the IRA
ceasefire, they tend to overlook the fact that there is not any ceasefire as
yet from the loyalist side,' he said after receiving an honorary doctorate
at St Joseph's University, Philadelphia.
'While abhorring the violence that I always believe was futile from the
beginning, I nevertheless want to acknowledge the courage of Gerry Adams and
the leadership of Sinn Fein,' he added.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Funds threat to housing associations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial lenders to housing associations are becoming increasingly
concerned at the very high levels of housing benefit required to help pay
tenants' rent, Halifax Building Society said yesterday.
Ministers have been considering ways of reducing the growing burden of
housing benefit as they seek to contain public spending. Any reduction in
payments levels could leave future housing association schemes vulnerable.
About Pounds 5.5bn is estimated to have been lent by the private sector to
associations which since 1988 have been required to raise a growing
proportion of their funds from the private sector.
From next April, associations in England will be expected to raise on
average 42 per cent of funds for new developments from the private sector.
This compares with 21 per cent in 1990-91.
Rents since then have risen sharply to generate adequate returns to private
sector lenders. Halifax is concerned that any further rise in rents could
make developments uncompetitive and inhibit fund raising.
Mr Douglas Smallwood, controller for policy and marketing in the society's
commercial lending division, told a conference in London yesterday: 'Mixed
funded housing associations will not continue to be regarded as a relatively
low risk segment of the market when compared with the private rented sector,
unless the rents it charges are within market rent levels.'
About 60 per cent of all housing association tenants and more than four
fifths of new tenants received housing benefit. Rents for new lettings by
associations were on average 60 per cent higher than council house relets.
'Unless this problem is addressed in a social housing sector, where there
might be an increasing number of providers and, therefore, more of a balance
between supply and demand, mixed funded housing associations could be at a
disadvantage,' said Mr Smallwood.
Halifax has lent about Pounds 1bn of the Pounds 3.9bn estimated to have been
lent by banks and building societies to associations since 1988 . A further
Pounds 1.6bn has come from institutional investors supporting capital market
issues.
'The appetite of the leading retail funders of housing associations is
finite,' said Mr Smallwood.
Methods used by the government and housing associations to measure the cost
of rents and establish benefit levels were inadequate and took no account of
the real cost of expenditure on necessities according to a study by
Cambridge University for Halifax building society.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Vatman swoops on canned cuppa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Customs and Excise has decided to tax drinks which are called tea but are
not freshly brewed.
The department has ruled that 'iced tea', sold in bottles or cans and
sometimes artificially flavoured, is a soft drink and should carry value
added tax at the standard rate.
Tax experts came to the decision yesterday after coming up with a definition
of tea which it thought would be accepted by 'the ordinary man in the
street'.
Customs said: 'Applying this criteria to tea the commissioners consider tea
as a drink made by pouring hot water on leaves, leaving it for a few minutes
to infuse, that is drunk, either hot or cold, to refresh and quench the
thirst.'
It added: 'In our view the ordinary man in the street would see a packaged
ice tea product as similar to a soft drink and not as a substitute for the
ordinary tea that the majority of the population drinks.'
Customs ruled that zero exemption should not extend to preparations which
include fruit juice or flavouring and citric acid, and which compete with
other beverages in the soft drink market.
Mr Carl Short, food manufacturing analyst with SGST Securities, said: 'Iced
tea has been a fast-growing market in the US during recent years and could
produce some excitement in the UK's tea and soft drinks markets. It
bestrides both the fast-growing soft drinks sector and the more mature tea
market.'
Herbal teas and similar products will continue to be zero rated for VAT
because they are considered to be ordinary foodstuffs which are drunk
instead of tea, or as an alternative.
A spokesman said that the concept of 'iced-tea' was a misnomer and the
department was always vigilant when new products started to appear on the
market. Iced tea served in a cafe or restaurant would not carry VAT as it
was brewed with real tea.
Customs made their decision in the light of past judgments of the
independent VAT tribunals which consider appeals by manufacturers. An appeal
may be made to yesterday's ruling.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Littlechild favours sell-off of nuclear power industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, favours
privatising the nuclear power industry, but believes power stations should
be redistributed among the two state-owned companies, Nuclear Electric and
Scottish Nuclear, in order to improve competition.
Prof Littlechild says in his submission to the government's nuclear review:
'There would be benefits in ensuring that all market participants throughout
Britain are fully exposed to private-sector financial disciplines. This
would maintain continuing pressure for increased efficiency.'
Prof Littlechild expresses two concerns, however. One is that all financial
aid should be removed from nuclear power. At the moment both companies are
subsidised either by electricity consumers or the taxpayer, and this is
creating market distortions.
The second is that the two companies each have strong market positions which
could inhibit competition. Prof Littlechild proposes that the bigger
company, Nuclear Electric, hand a number of power stations to Scottish
Nuclear. This would weaken Nuclear Electric's market position in England and
Wales and strengthen Scottish Nuclear's position south of the border.
Alternatively, Scottish Nuclear could give one of its power stations to
Nuclear Electric so as to introduce a new competitor into the Scottish
market.
Prof Littlechild says there is no case for the government subsidising the
construction of further nuclear plant because it is not needed.
Both companies welcomed the regulator's support for privatisation but
reacted coolly to his proposals for plant reallocation.
The government should assist the construction of further nuclear capacity to
ensure diversity of supply and keep alive the UK's nuclear technology
capability, says the Institution of Electrical Engineers.
The body says in its submission to the review that the future of fossil
fuels is uncertain and only nuclear can fill the gap. Nuclear also provides
environmental advantages because it produces no gaseous emissions.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Farmers fear loss of subsidies in expanded EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Farmers face the abolition of all price support if eastern European
countries join the European Union, the National Farmers' Union said
yesterday.
This prospect was set out in a paper drawn up by the union's leadership and
launched at a meeting of its policy-making council.
Mr Martin Haworth, head of international affairs, said extending Common
Agricultural Policy subsidies to eastern Europe 'could prove potentially
fatal to the EU'.
Not only would it mean a possible doubling of the present CAP budget of
about Ecu35bn (Pounds 27bn), it would also encourage increased production in
eastern Europe, which has great agricultural potential, and lead to fresh
surpluses in western Europe.
Export of these surpluses to world markets could not be subsidised because
of new limits under the Gatt trade deal.
Mr Haworth said that opposing enlargement of the European Union was
unrealistic since member states were committed to the goal of membership for
six eastern and central European countries - Hungary, Poland, the Czech
Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania.
He said: 'There's not much of a choice at all. It's very hard to see how you
can continue with any kind of price support in an enlarged community.'
The document, with one released in March on the implications for the CAP of
the Gatt accord, is very different in tone from the complacent approach
taken by the union in the past.
It follows closely an independent study published, but not endorsed, by the
European Commission, which called for farm subsidies to be phased into
national budgets, with compensation for the worst hit regions.
The union leadership is focusing on two options for reform which it
considers the most realistic.
Eastern European countries could establish a low level of price support for
their farmers - enough to cover essential production costs - in advance of
joining the EU.
Prices for western European farmers would then be lowered to these levels,
with 'some form of further compensation,' according to the paper.
Alternatively, all price support would end, to be replaced with 'decoupled'
aid for EU farmers - payments unrelated to how much they produce. While this
would discourage overproduction, it would have some disadvantages.
The document says: 'They relate to the budgetary cost if an equivalent level
of support is to be granted, or the impact on farm incomes if it is not.'
Mr Haworth accepted that the union's 100,000 members might take a different
view. But he disputed the argument of some farmers that further reforms to
the CAP could be postponed.
He said: 'We need to take a decision as to how we change the CAP very
quickly.
'The more it's delayed, the more these countries will try to align
themselves with the current CAP. This is storing up many more problems than
we've already got.'

FT  07 OCT 94 / Satellites beam down on winter wheat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Brian Welti this week planted the first wheat field in Britain to use US
military navigation satellites.
Mr Welti, a farm manager at Shuttleworth College farm in Bedfordshire,
planted 15 acres of winter wheat using a mapping system developed by Massey
Ferguson, the farm equipment maker.
His tractor was fitted with global positioning equipment which enabled it to
pick up signals from 21 satellites in orbit 12,000 miles above the earth.
Mr Welti said: 'This system is such a new application of technology in
farming. We think it is going to mean considerable savings both financially
and environmentally in the long run, but we don't know how much yet.'
The positioning system can improve profits by allowing farmers to sow more
seed on fertile parts of their land than on poorer areas.
It can also be used to vary the application of fertilisers and
agro-chemicals much more accurately in parts of a field with specific
problems. This enables farmers to save money by limiting the use of
chemicals and farming in a more environmentally-friendly way.
Data about the amount of grain produced in any part of a field is collected
by a yield meter mounted on a combine harvester during the harvest. This
information is used to produce a yield map of the more productive sections.
Mr Welti said that yields could vary by as much as 100 per cent across a
field.
Farmers can use the yield map to draw up a plan for applying seeds,
fertilisers or chemicals and feed this, via a disk or smart card, into a
tractor's computer. The tractor system uses positioning information signals
from the satellites to increase or decrease the amount of seed being
planted, according to where it is in the field.
Mr Welti said: 'Up till now farmers have just treated a field as a field,
but now we know precisely where we're getting a return and where we're not.'
The equipment for yield mapping and global positioning costs Pounds 11,500
and can be fitted to most tractors and combine harvesters.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Visa cuts fraud losses by 24%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Visa, the international card payments system, said yesterday that fraudulent
payments had fallen by 24 per cent in the first quarter of this year,
reflecting greatly improved detection procedures.
The fall occurred in Visa's Europe, Middle East and Africa division where
sales volume for the first quarter of this year was Dollars 44.6bn, (Pounds
28.2bn) an increase of 11.7 per cent from the first quarter of last year.
Visa defines fraud as the use of lost and stolen cards or cards not received
by the owner, fraudulent applications, counterfeit cards and fraudulent use
of account numbers.
It said that, while the number of attempts to acquire merchandise
fraudulently through the use of its cards had not declined, its use of
technology and 'human intervention programmes' had greatly improved
detection.
Among these is a risk-identification service which identifies suspect
merchants and informs member banks for subsequent action.
A code has been embedded in each card's magnetic strip, which is checked
when it is passed through a point-of-sale terminal. This has helped reduce
counterfeiting or alteration of the magnetic strip and helped reduce losses
through counterfeiting to Dollars 17.5m.
Visa has improved its database so that high-risk areas can be identified and
fraud detection resources allocated to them.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Doctors ready to combat local pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Doctors' leaders yesterday started preparing plans for action if the
government imposes local pay bargaining on National Health Service
hospitals.
In a move that takes the medical profession a step closer to all-out
confrontation with the government, the British Medical Association decided
to convene its sanctions working party to consider action to be taken if
ministers introduce the proposed pay changes without agreement.
The government intends to start replacing the NHS's centralised pay
structure with local performance-related arrangements next year. It faces
opposition from unions and professional organisations. Hospital doctors are
particularly concerned that they might come under local management pressure
to follow financial rather than clinical priorities.
Mr James Johnson, a Liverpool surgeon who became chairman of the BMA's
central consultants and specialists committee yesterday, said his priority
would be to 'carry on the fight against the government's ill-conceived
proposals'.
The Department of Health has been trying to negotiate BMA agreement on an
enabling clause which would open the way to the shift from centralised to
local pay bargaining. The BMA is refusing to accept the clause, but
ministers have powers to impose it. Mr Johnson said that, if the government
decided to do so, it would give rise to a dispute. The decision to convene
the sanctions working party was in response to calls for action from
consultants who felt 'beleaguered under the government's continuing
onslaught on their professional values'.
The ultimate sanction available to consultants would be mass withdrawal from
the NHS. Some doctors favour setting up consultants' chambers on similar
lines to barristers, enabling them to set the terms on which they would
provide their services to the NHS.
Other consultants fear such a course of action could precipitate the very
thing the BMA is most worried about - the break-up of a health service with
national standards and conditions. More traditional sanctions would include
a decision by consultants to undertake only medical duties, withdrawing from
management tasks and other work not directly related to patient care.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Tories decide against tackling Blair head-on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior Tories have decided against launching a head-on assault on Mr Tony
Blair's new-style Labour leadership at next week's party conference in
Bournemouth.
Instead they expect to concentrate on highlighting what they see as the
government's solid record of achievement since the last general election and
to unveil a handful of detailed policy proposals in areas such as social
security, law and order and possibly education.
Cabinet ministers yesterday agreed on this approach at a 20-minute meeting
in spite of signs of mounting backbench concern about the danger posed by Mr
Blair.
Party officials believe better results can be achieved by contrasting this
image of business-like Conservative government with what they see as
Labour's vapid idealism.
They feel the government has much to be proud of in its handling of areas
such as Northern Ireland, crime prevention and the economy. They acknowledge
however that the recovery has yet to produce a 'feelgood factor' among
voters, many of whom have become worse off since 1992 because of tax
increases.
It is safe to assume, however, that Mr Blair's embarrassing defeat yesterday
over Labour's commitment to widespread public ownership will not pass
entirely unmentioned.
This insight into Tory conference planning emerged as Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, attempted to steady party nerves by saying it was 'in the grasp
of the Conservative party to win the election quite comfortably when it
comes'. Mr Clarke said the party would use next week's conference to 'carry
on with the momentum of successful change we have made in this country.'
With Europe less high on the political agenda than in recent years and Mr
John Major having to some extent reasserted his grip, Northern Ireland might
emerge as one of the week's principal talking-points.
In spite of a general perception that the prime minister has handled the
issue well, the party's vocal and influential integrationist camp is likely
to demand reassurance about the direction of government policy.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Test case due on lost pension rights: Union says 500,000
employees could be affected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The GMB general union plans to mount a legal challenge in the High Court in
an attempt to win pension rights for thousands of workers whose
public-sector jobs have been privatised.
The test case has been lodged on behalf of five school catering workers in
Preston, Lancashire, who in June transferred their employment from
Lancashire County Council to BET Catering Services, a BET subsidiary.
The case has been filed under Tupe - the Transfer of Undertakings
(Protection of Employment) - legislation, which protects the terms and
conditions of public-sector employees whose contracts are transferred to the
private sector. Tupe implements in British law the European acquired rights
directive.
The five, all women, lost their entitlement to the local government
superannuation scheme when they transferred to their new employer. The union
is arguing that they should maintain their previous pension rights or be
provided with an equivalent pension.
Mr Mick Graham, the union's national secretary for local government,
estimated that the pension rights of as many as 500,000 employees could be
affected if the union won a ruling that was allowed to be applied
retrospectively. He said: 'Under the law your pension is part of your pay.
It is outrageous that someone's pension can be removed through no fault of
their own.'
One of the women, Ms Barbara Adams from Ribbleton Hall High School near
Preston, said: 'It seems unfair that I can't get a pension even though I'm
doing the same job as before.'
Two previous attempts to bring the transfer of pension rights within the
directive both foundered when they were pursued at industrial tribunals. The
GMB has opted to take a different tack by going to the High Court.
The union pointed out that the government was itself urging companies
seeking to tender for newly privatised public-sector contracts to provide
equivalent pension rights.
The Department of Employment said: 'The government's view and recommendation
is that when transfer of undertaking rules apply the new employers should
undertake to offer a similar or equivalent pension to the newly transferring
employees. This is not an obligation but a recommendation.'
BET said last night that it was unable to comment since it had not received
notice of legal action.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Tube strike could cost Pounds 1.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 24-hour Tube strike, which started at 7.30 last night, could disrupt the
travel of about 3.6m people and cost London Underground Pounds 1.5m in
revenue.
But the company urged the public to use the Tube as normal, saying that up
to 60 per cent of the network should be operating today.
London Underground is considering seeking damages from the RMT transport
union for any income lost as a result of its members' actions. It said that
only about 25 per cent of the 7,500 RMT workers on the Underground had
backed disruption. It added: 'This strike has no mandate.'
The company has decided not to mount a legal challenge over the ballot's
validity although it has suggested that some staff did not receive ballot
papers.
The RMT executive decided to hold the strike after a three-hour meeting
yesterday at which it discussed the legal position, given London
Underground's allegation that the ballot had not been conducted fairly.
The union is demanding at least a 4 per cent pay rise for its members
although five other unions have settled for 2.5 per cent deals for their
members working on the Tube. Mr Wilf Proudfoot, the RMT's assistant general
secretary, said last night: 'I don't believe we are asking for anything that
is unreasonable. We remain ready to resume negotiations at any time. I
expect RMT members to give the strike call their total support.'
The union executive has not announced any further strikes. Seven days'
notice has to be given of any planned disruption.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Supermarkets 'will undercut BP'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Supermarket chains Asda and Tesco said last night they would beat any cuts
in the price of petrol made by BP, the oil company, which has launched a
campaign to win back customers from supermarket filling stations.
BP this week unveiled an advertising campaign devised by Mr Joe Johnston,
the Hollywood director whose films include Honey I Shrunk the Kids, aimed at
reinforcing the message that its petrol stations offer good value for money.
It is backing the campaign with a promise to match the price of petrol at
supermarket petrol stations, on a town-by-town basis.
BP said it was 'fed up with the growth in volume achieved by hypermarkets'
and the erosion of its share of the petrol market.
But in statements last night both Tesco and Asda said they would undercut
any price moves by BP, raising the possibility of a petrol price war.
Mr Reg Curtis, Tesco petrol trading manager, said: 'Where we find BP
matching the Tesco petrol price we will drop our price.
'Our petrol business is successful because we provide customers with what
they want - good quality petrol at the cheapest prices.'
Asda said it was 'not going to be undercut by BP'.
Mr Laurie Boyle, commercial director, said Asda continued to invest heavily
in its petrol business and was 'confident that our customers will continue
to enjoy unbeatable value'.
Competition between oil companies and retailers has intensified as grocery
superstores have built up a 17 per cent share of the petrol market. Tesco
recently opened three stand-alone petrol stations in London.

<TEXT>
British Telecommunications and its main union, the NCU communications union,
have finally reached agreement on a more flexible system of working time,
David Goodhart writes.
The system will mean more BT employees are available in the evenings and at
weekends. It has been the subject of tense negotiations especially over
whether employees would be compelled to work new shifts.
Union members have now voted heavily in favour of the changes, having
rejected them equally heavily a few weeks ago. About 14,000 union members
responded to the ballot out of a possible 26,900. Just over 10,000 voted in
favour and just over 4,000 voted against.
In a joint statement last night BT and the NCU said: 'We are now committed
jointly to ensuring the agreement is implemented in a quality way, and is
honoured in both letter and intent.'

FT  07 OCT 94 / Road projects attract 70 companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 70 companies forming 17 consortia have applied to bid for
contracts to build and manage new or improved roads, the Department of
Transport said yesterday.
A shortlist of those selected to make bids for the four road schemes already
chosen by the government will be announced in about a month.
Under the scheme contractors will be expected to design new roads or
improvements to existing ones, finance their construction and manage and
maintain them for between 15 and 25 years. They will be paid 'shadow tolls'
by the government, reflecting traffic volumes on the roads and the quality
of maintenance.
Among the consortia which have declared an interest in the the programme
are:
Construction companies Costain and Bovis, the RAC and NatWest Markets. The
RAC contribution would be its traffic management and information systems.
Contractors John Laing and Tarmac with Welsh Water, Transroute, a French
toll road operator, and BZW, a merchant bank.
Construction companies Amec and Alfred McAlpine with a Spanish contractor,
Dragados.
Construction groups Taylor Woodrow, Sir Robert McAlpine and Amey with banker
Morgan Stanley.
Trafalgar House, Wimpey and Autostrada of Italy. Trafalgar House said it was
interested in bidding for the biggest of the schemes proposed.
Balfour Beatty, WS Atkins, Philipp Holzmann and Bank of America. Balfour
Beatty said it would bid for all four schemes.
Mowlem, Dumez GTM of France and Schroders merchant bank.

Mr David Holt, the Bank's senior manager of supervision and surveillance,

FT  07 OCT 94 / Walker trial in its final stages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The judge in the trial of Mr George Walker, the former chairman of the Brent
Walker group, yesterday warned the jury that fraud on a company was not a
'victimless' crime, John Mason writes.
Beginning his summing up, Judge Geoffrey Rivlin said the money at issue
sometimes came from shareholders who were entitled to expect a company's
accounts to be honest.
The prosecution claims that Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former

FT  07 OCT 94 / Ucatt ballot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ucatt, the construction union, has delayed a ballot on its merger with the
TGWU general union until it has completed its financial survival plan.
The union hopes to cut a quarter of its 120 staff in the next few weeks
through the use of voluntary redundancies. It also hopes to sell off four of
its 12 regional offices in an attempt to restore its financial balance by
the end of next year.
The union had a Pounds 1.05m operating deficit last year and has an
accumulated deficit in its general fund of Pounds 3.17m. It had to pay
Pounds 200,000 in interest charges on its Pounds 1.248m overdraft facility
with Unity Bank last year. The bank has insisted that the union must carry
out drastic cuts for continuing financial support.
Mr George Brumwell, Ucatt's general secretary, said yesterday: 'We have
embarked on a final phase of restructuring and rationalisation. That process
is nearing its completion but the union has undergone a major, though very
necessary, upheaval.' He added that the union wanted to see its 'new
regional structure bedded in before tackling the major administrative task
of a full national ballot on merger'.
The union said last night that the merger ballot might go ahead in December
but denied that its postponement from this month by the union's executive's
was due to concerns in the TGWU about the state of the Ucatt's finances.
Ucatt was originally to have an autonomous trade group of the larger union
at the start of 1995, if the ballot had approved the merger.

P&amp;O, the shipping and construction group, yesterday announced the
acquisition of management control of a recently privatised terminal at
Puerto Nuevo, which serves the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires.
This is P&amp;O's first move into the management of container port facilities in
Latin America, Lord Sterling, chairman, said. The group's Australian
subsidiary has acquired a 40 per cent stake in the equity of the venture and
it will supply the management of the terminal and provide support services.
The activities acquired by P&amp;O account for 270,000 teu (20ft equivalent
units) container movements a year, out of the total handled by the port of
about 500,000.
P&amp;O is also looking to extend its container operations at Montevideo in
Uruguay and in Brazil and Mexico. 'This project will act as a springboard
for further investment opportunities in the region,' Lord Sterling said.
P&amp;O's local partner in the project, which is to be renamed Terminales Rio de
la Plata, is Murchison Roman.

FT  07 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Support grows for free trade in Apec -
Indonesia's Suharto emerges as a surprise advocate of liberalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The leaders of Asia-Pacific nations, including President Bill Clinton, could
make a public commitment to free trade in the region by the year 2020 or
even 2010 when they attend a summit in Indonesia next month, according to
officials of several governments supporting the idea.
The proposal for a bold statement of intent from the leaders of the
17-nation Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum (Apec), who meet next
month in Bogor, near Jakarta, is broadly in line with the recommendations of
an Apec 'eminent persons group' (EPG).
Supporters of rapid liberalisation have found an unexpected ally in
Indonesia's President Suharto, who has surprised other south-east Asian
governments and some of his own ministers by declaring his wholehearted
support for free trade as the Apec summit approaches. Indonesia has lowered
tariffs and reduced non-tariff barriers in recent years, but it still has
one of the most protected economies in the region.
'We have high hopes that the forthcoming meeting in Bogor will produce
fundamental agreements on the type of co-operation between Apec members and
on the rate of trade and investment liberalisation among us,' Mr Suharto
said in a speech yesterday.
In a report in August the EPG urged Apec to complete trade liberalisation by
2020; it also said economically advanced Apec members should eliminate their
trade barriers more quickly than developing or newly-industrialised nations.
Although they have reservations about the EPG report, the US and Australia
are among the most prominent supporters of a target date for free trade.
Malaysia, on the other hand, is opposed to the idea, arguing that Apec risks
being dominated by the US and should remain an informal consultative
organisation; Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysian prime minister, refused to
attend the first Apec summit in Seattle last year.
Apec - whose members yesterday reiterated their support for global trade
liberalisation and the formation of the World Trade Organisation - comprises
the US, Japan and China, as well as Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia,
Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, New
Zealand, Papua-New Guinea, Canada and Mexico. Chile is due to join next
month.
At an Apec ministers' meeting in Jakarta yesterday, Mr Bob McMullan,
Australian trade minister, said that the EPG report was a matter for debate
but that there was support for a declaration of principle on free trade by a
specific date.
'It's more likely than not that there will be an agreement about a timetable
for trade liberalisation at the Bogor meeting,' he told reporters.
However, critics of Mr Suharto, who is 73, say he is more interested in
hosting a memorable summit and leaving his mark on world affairs than in the
reality of free trade. His new allies respond that they would rather applaud
his change of heart than question the motives behind it.

FT  07 OCT 94 / World Trade News: House delays votes on Gatt ratification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The fate of Gatt in the US Congress is on hold for at least seven more weeks
following the decision of the House to copy the Senate and come back into
session at the end of next month for the crucial votes.
The House Democratic leadership was forced on Wednesday night to postpone
the vote scheduled for yesterday after Republican objections to the rules
under which the debate would be conducted. These stem from an opposition
campaign against a telecommunications provision in the bill.
But in a letter sent to President Bill Clinton, leaders of both parties in
the House diplomatically chose to blame their decision to call a lame duck
session on November 29, after the November 8 mid-term elections, on the
Senate delay of the Gatt vote until December 1.
'The Senate decision,' the letter said, 'has quite frankly undermined our
ability to guarantee strong bipartisan support for this effort in the House
at this time.' But both the Speaker, Mr Tom Foley, and the Republican
leader, Mr Bob Michel, predicted it would eventually pass.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the trade representative, who had spent much of Wednesday
testifying to Congress for the Gatt bill, put the best face on what was
nevertheless a setback for the administration. 'There's no reason in the
world to take any chances with the world's largest trade agreement,' he
said.
Mr Clinton weighed in by saying at a press conference that Gatt amounted to
the 'biggest world tax cut in history' and a 'huge job gainer' for the US.
The Senate delay was brought about last week by Senator Ernest Hollings, the
South Carolina Democrat, who exercised his right as a committee chairman to
force a 45- day interval before the climactic vote. The chamber will come
back into session on November 30 with a vote scheduled for the following
day.
The new Congress does not take office until next January so the lame duck
sessions will feature the existing line-up. That still leans towards
approval, as a procedural vote later on Wednesday night seemed to indicate:
also more than 100 retiring senators and congressmen may feel free to vote
their consciences without fear of retribution at the polls or from party
whips.
Nevertheless the outcome of the November 8 mid-term elections may have a
sizeable influence on the lame duck sessions. If conservative Republicans,
increasingly associated with 'America First' positions and complaining that
Gatt imperils US sovereignty, make expected gains, opposition to the
agreement may grow.
Congressman Michel, a long-time supporter of free trade who is retiring this
year, conceded that he had been caught unawares by the anti-Gatt campaign
waged over the last week by Congressman Newt Gingrich, his almost certain
successor as Republican leader.

FT  07 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Tetra Pak loses appeal against fine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tetra Pak, the Swedish packaging group, yesterday lost an appeal against an
Ecu75m (Dollars 93m) fine levied by the European Commission, but said it was
almost certain to contest the decision in the European Court.
The Commission imposed the fine in 1991, arguing the group had abused its
dominant position between 1982 and 1986 by deliberately trying to stifle
competition. The fine - the Commission's biggest against a single company -
was equivalent to 2 per cent of the group's 1990 turnover.
The company's attempt to have the fine overturned by the European Court of
First Instance has been rejected.
The wrangle centres on market definitions. Brussels argues the Swedish
company's position in 'aseptically filled carton packages' is too dominant.
Tetra Pak does not deny this, but says the dominance - equal to as much as
80 per cent of the market - is not surprising because it invented the
aseptically filled carton package concept.
But it argues that its share of the wider 'liquid food' market is a more
relevant yardstick. Here it only has a 15 per cent share because of
competition from cans and plastic and glass bottles.
Mr Christer Hedelin, Tetra Pak International general counsel, said: 'We are
extremely disappointed that the court has chosen to remain with the old
traditional way of looking at market forces.' The company says it is 'most
likely' to appeal.

FT  07 OCT 94 / World Trade News: EU urged to shift focus to Asian markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union yesterday turned its attention eastwards, amid mounting
criticism that Europe risks losing out on Asia's 'economic miracle' by being
too slow to develop political and economic ties. At a conference in
Brussels, Sir Leon Brittan, commissioner responsible for foreign affairs,
warned the European Union needed to shift its focus rapidly towards greater
trade with Asian markets.
'The task is now to make a reality of what we all accept as an objective -
better economic ties between the EU and Asia,' said Sir Leon.
But Mr Nicolas Maclean, the chairman for Asia of Unice, the European
employers' federation, said: 'This forum is about 20 years overdue. For far
too long, many EU companies have held Asian markets at arm's length and have
now woken up to the fact that they are missing out.'
Over the summer, the Commission published its first ever strategy document
on Asia designed to launch a radical rethink of EU strategy. It warned that
if European companies were unable to earn an adequate share of Asian growth
over the next decade, their worldwide profits and competitiveness would be
affected. This in turn could exacerbate calls for more protectionist
policies from those in Europe who view Asia as a threat, rather than a
lucrative opportunity.
Last month, foreign ministers from the EU and the six Asean countries agreed
to intensify political and economic relations, as well as to reinforce
dialogue in such areas as security and the environment.
However, significant differences in view also emerged from the meeting, in
particular Asean opposition to EU efforts to link trade to human rights and
the conditions of workers.
At yesterday's conference of 150 business leaders, organised by the European
Commission and the Financial Times, the opening speeches by Sir Leon and Mr
Manuel Marin, commissioner responsible for co-operation and development with
Asia, avoided such issues. Both speakers concentrated instead on Europe's
enthusiasm to develop links.
Mr Marin said a positive message on Asia had to be communicated to Europe's
citizens: 'Increased demand in Asia for European products, services and
expertise will obviously boost job growth and prospects in Europe.'
However, he pointed out that collaboration with Asian companies did not
appear to be a top priority with most European companies.
According to the Commission paper, a number of factors are at play. These
include a lack of understanding of the Asian business environment and the
lack of a clearly defined image of Europe in Asia.
Mr Maclean said three things had to happen if Europe was to be truly
effective in trading with Asia. First, bureaucratic pressure had to be eased
in Europe, to allow companies to be as competitive as possible. The member
states also had to act in co-ordination, and make real attempts to
understand the different Asian cultures.
'If we ignore this, then culture will remain the greatest non-tariff barrier
to our chances of strengthening our economic presence in Asia,' he said.

FT  07 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Hong Kong shrugs off doubts
</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong has shrugged off earlier economic uncertainties surrounding the
1997 handover of the colony to Chinese rule and looks set for continued
rapid growth sustained by a large booming economy on its doorstep, the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade said yesterday.
The latest report by the Gatt secretariat on Hong Kong's trade policies and
practices says trade patterns have changed markedly over the past few years.
Exports of domestic goods stagnated between 1990 and 1993 but re-exports
from China doubled and services exports increased by over 50 per cent.
At the same time, Hong Kong-based companies have poured investment into
China, especially in the neighbouring Guangdong Province and the Special
Economic Zones.
Hong Kong is the largest source of foreign direct investment in China and in
1993 accounted for 83 per cent of such investment in Guangdong province as
businesses took advantage of lower costs to relocate basic manufacturing
activities.
However, Gatt notes that a drop of two-fifths in Hong Kong's manufacturing
workforce since the mid-1980s has been entirely offset by a rise in services
employment, especially business services such as finance, marketing, design
and logistics.
Textiles and clothing still represent over one-third of manufacturing
value-added, followed by electrical and electronic products with about
one-quarter.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Psy Ops war waged in Haiti: An operation meant to please
Washington as well as the locals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In military jargon, Psy Ops stands for Psychological Operations, actions
designed to mislead the enemy or influence the climate of opinion in
conflict zones. While they might be the key to a particular mission, Psy Op
agents usually work independently.
Yet as the US lays the ground for the imminent return to Haiti of exiled
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, its occupation of the country seems to be
one big Psy Op. What it suggests is that the US believes getting Mr Aristide
back in power is a question of changing minds more than changing conditions.
Every movement of US troops has a 'target audience in addition to a military
target', says one Psy Op planner. When troops raided the headquarters of
Fraph, the paramilitary organisation loyal to the coup leaders, soldiers led
about 30 of those captured on a slow parade through central Port-au-Prince
and let Aristide supporters tear up the office.
The idea, said the planner, was to demonstrate to Fraph and the American
people that the US could take charge whenever it wanted and that it had the
capital's vengeful mobs on its side.
The Central Intelligence Agency in Washington last night denied reports that
it had helped set up Fraph in 1991.
President Bill Clinton is no longer chided for having 17,000 troops in Haiti
doing nothing. And the lack of serious confrontation with Fraph, which still
has an estimated 200,000 members with 30,000 weapons at large, leaves him
less exposed to criticisms that the US is becoming bogged down in a
Somalia-like mission.
Another big hit in Haiti, and on CNN, are searches of homes where it is
suspected anti-Aristide forces have stored weapons. On one of these raids a
contingent of 10 US soldiers found two pistols and three rifles in a storage
shed, enough to arrest the man guarding the flimsy structure.
After they left, the shack was reduced to rubble by jubilant Haitians. A
Sergeant MacPhearson later told an assembled crowd: 'We promise to keep
raiding them if you promise to keep destroying them.'
Still, these raids have netted less than 300 weapons, and US military
spokesman Colonel Barry Willey admitted that faulty intelligence means 'we
don't know until we get there whether we've gone on a wild goose chase'.
Military commanders also know that politicians in Washington can make or
break this mission, so they have become a 'target' as well. When senators
came down on a whirlwind fact-finding tour, Bradley armoured cars
uncharacteristically left the US base, some with orders to roll by just as
the visitors were to begin their press conference, to give the impression of
the US being firmly in charge.
Also meant for consumption in Washington, according to a Special Forces
media liaison officer, are the television shots of Haitians cheering the US
forces. Television crews are given priority with military units that are
likely to encounter positive crowds, thus giving Mr Clinton some 'breathing
room' as Congress debates whether to impose a date for troop withdrawal.
US actions, psychological or not, are certainly building momentum for the
return of Mr Aristide. Fraph, the police and the army are lying low and
Aristide supporters, feeling protected by the Americans, are growing more
confident by the day. But whether these shows of force are creating the
conditions for Mr Aristide to rule is another question.
Mr Roosevelt Poteau, owner of a computer supply and repair shop, is eagerly
awaiting the end of the economic embargo that Mr Aristide will bring with
him, yet is wary that 'US forces are leaving our president too much hard
work for him to do by himself'.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Republicans kill bill on lobbying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Republican senators yesterday succeeded in killing a bill to limit the gifts
they could receive from lobbyists, adding one more scalp to their collection
of legislation blocked or defeated in the closing days of the congressional
session, George Graham writes from Washington.
Democratic leaders failed to achieve the two-thirds majority they needed to
break a Republican filibuster against the bill, which would have stiffened
the registration requirements for people who spend money or are paid to
lobby Congress or the administration.
The bill, which passed the House last week, would have barred most gifts
from lobbyists to members of Congress - except for campaign contributions -
and would have allowed members to accept meals only up to a value of Dollars
20 (Pounds 12.60).
The lobbying reform bill had provoked the anger of many members who felt it
demeaned them by suggesting they could be bought so cheaply, and had
particularly irritated golfers, because it would prevent them from accepting
expense-paid trips to the many charity golf tournaments mounted every year
in choice resorts by businesses and trade associations.
But this is not the kind of argument that members are eager to make less
than five weeks ahead of an election, and last-minute opposition to the bill
in the House last week and then this week in the Senate has focused on
claims that the measure would infringe the right of religious groups to
lobby Congress.
Congressman Newt Gingrich, the Republican minority whip in the House and the
leader of the campaign to kill the bill, called it 'a gag rule on the
grassroots'.
Since the bill mostly exempts church groups from registering their
communications with members as a lobbying activity, this explanation appears
less credible than the Republicans' fierce determination to deny the
Democrats' even the smallest legislative victory ahead of the November 8
mid-term election.
President Bill Clinton had said both lobbying and campaign finance reform
were high priorities for him, but both have now been defeated.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Cardoso pledge on Brazil social problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso claimed victory in Brazil's presidential
elections yesterday, promising to tackle the country's huge social problems
and seek a higher profile in international affairs.
Mr Cardoso, a former academic turned social democrat politician, was
speaking for the first time since Monday's poll, which, with more than half
the votes counted, he appears to have won easily.
Sitting in front of an enormous Brazilian flag, Mr Cardoso said: 'The
biggest task is to overcome our social injustice. We are no longer an
undeveloped country, we are the 10th largest economy in the world, but we
have huge social problems.'
He promised especially to improve education, where Brazil lags behind many
other developing nations, and basic health services.
Mr Cardoso said Brazil's new economic stability, brought by the Real
currency which he helped launch this year as finance minister, gave the
country the opportunity to be more involved in regional and international
affairs. Brazil wants a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and Mr
Cardoso said the country needed to recognise that such claims demanded a
'very active' role in the world.
Mr Cardoso said he was committed to private sector investment in areas of
state monopoly and wanted to make private-sector joint ventures in oil and
petroleum more flexible. However, state-owned Petrobras would not be
privatised.
Private sector investment would also be allowed in areas such as
telecommunications and energy generation. Mr Cardoso favoured privatising
Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the biggest state-controlled mining company.
Mr Cardoso made some tough comments on Brazil's state-owned banks, many of
which are in difficulty because of politically-inspired lending. Loss-making
banks should be cleaned up rather than supported with government money. 'If
a bank is doing badly it needs to be turned round,' he said, irrespective of
whether the bank was controlled by a political ally or enemy. 'Brazil cannot
postpone this decision any longer.'
Some reforms, in areas such as tax reform and wage legislation, were needed
to guarantee the continued success of the Real. He said these matters would
be discussed with Congress and doubted any significant changes would be made
before he becomes president on January 1.
Mr Cardoso said he expected his victory would lead to greater foreign
investment in Brazil. Some foreigners had delayed investments in case he
lost to his main opponent, the left-winger Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
According to election authorities, with slightly over half the votes
counted, Mr Cardoso leads Mr da Silva by 54 per cent to 25 per cent.
Mr Cardoso said no 'radical measure' would be used to stop foreign
investment flows if the Real continued to rise against the US dollar.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Is Caesar's aide's girlfriend behaving?: Jurek Martin
wonders if Washington's pursuit of ethical standards has gone too far
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The resignation of Mr Mike Espy as US agriculture secretary has set
Washington and national tongues clucking again, in a number of unexpected
ways.
Naturally, the fact that he was accused of taking favours from the
agribusiness interests he was supposed to regulate has left the door open
for those inclined to the high moral road.
Under the direction of Mr Howell Raines in the past two years, editorial
comment in the notionally liberal New York Times have torn into the Clinton
administration's ethical standards with a savagery that has often rendered
conservative commentary superfluous.
It said Mr Espy's behaviour 'gave, at the very least, the appearance of
conflict of interest. It was also colossally stupid.' It also damned his
department, which the newspaper's reporters had found guilty of excessive
payments for disaster relief, as 'too close to food producers and farmers'.
The Wall Street Journal's editorial column usually blames everything on
President Bill Clinton. The Espy affair, it wrote, was consistent with 'the
larger story now of people in our politics who are unable to recognise any
line between the realms of private and public life'.
Much speculation turned, inevitably, on who would be next to go from the
cabinet, with Mr Henry Cisneros, the housing secretary, top of most lists.
He stands accused of not telling the FBI the full story about his financial
arrangements with a former lover when it was conducting background checks
before his appointment.
He was forced to say he would not resign, but that turned attention to
support he was getting from the White House, which has a reputation for
giving way under fire.
But if all this was easy to predict, others have begun to wonder if the
manic pursuit of purity in Washington office-holders is not going too far.
A tart editorial in the Baltimore Sun found it hard to believe that a
corporation, Tyson Foods of Arkansas, whose lawyer had helped Mrs Hillary
Clinton earn Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 63,000) in commodities trading, would
bother with a Dollars 1,200 scholarship to Mr Espy's companion, which,
indeed, seems to have been the straw that broke his back.
'But,' it added derisively, 'that's what it has come to in Washington.
Caesar's assistant's girlfriend has to be above suspicion?'
Mr Peter Jennings, the ABC television anchorman, also had his reservations
in a radio commentary. Nothing the agriculture secretary may have done would
have been illegal while he was a congressman.
Mr Jennings told the story of another current cabinet member who, returning
from a trip with his wife, took a government car from the airport - but sent
his wife home by taxi so as not to infringe any ethical code. The head of
the Government Services Agency's chief is the latest on the block for having
allegedly transgressed the rules.
These standards, tightened by the Clinton administration, are indeed strict.
For example, no journalist may buy a civil servant meals worth more than
Dollars 20 a session or Dollars 50 a year, which does not buy much in
Washington these days.
A Washington Post editorial, while concluding that Mr Espy was 'right to
resign', wondered at the hypocrisy of a Congress so wedded to special
interests that it has killed campaign finance reform and may do the same to
lobbying reform. 'Perhaps the people who kill this bill, if they manage to
do that, will have the grace to step down too.'
There was also something of a rallying to Mr Espy not merely from his fellow
blacks but also from both sides of the farming fence, where he was seen as
both knowledgeable about the industry and sensitive to consumer interests.
But performance on the job - or qualifications for it - matter much less
these days. Men and women have been drummed out of town or not let into it
for technical breaches of immigration and tax laws concerning domestic help
mostly honoured only in the breach.
Or, as in the case of Ms Ricki Tigert, only this week confirmed to run the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation after an eight-month delay, agencies
have been left headless because of the heinous sin of a presumed friendship
with the First Lady.
It may be true that the Clinton administration, by raising the ethical
banner, left itself open to criticism when its members fell short.
Republican exploitation of such shortcomings may also be just standard
politics.
But when elected office can be bought merely by spending a lot of money, it
can seem rough justice when the receipt of just a little means the end of a
Washington career.

FT  07 OCT 94 / A growing interest in Islamic banking: Western banks are
becoming more involved in a Dollars 50bn sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROULA KHALAF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Islamic banks have been springing up all over the Middle East in the past
decade, quietly collecting deposits from Moslems who like to consult the
Koran before deciding where to put their money.
So why is the Gulf buzzing with talk of the imminent arrival of a new
Islamic bank in Bahrain?
Because the bank is Citibank, which has confirmed plans to open the first
full-fledged western Islamic bank next year and subscribe to the Koran's
prohibition on dealing in interest.
Often dismissed by the west as a fad riding on the back of Islamic
fundamentalism, Islamic banking was judged by western bankers as a
phenomenon confined to Islamic regions. With Citibank now in the game, the
estimated Dollars 50bn (Pounds 31.6bn) industry may at last start to
integrate with the world financial system.
Citibank is already an expert in Islamic finance. It is among the handful of
western banks that have been availing themselves of cheap Islamic deposits
for more than a decade. When the Islamic banks were born in the early 1980s
depositors were happy to leave their mountains of savings in current
accounts.
But the banks had to invest this liquidity in conservative and short-term
instruments while at the same time circumventing interest. Lacking contacts
and experience, Islamic bankers turned to western institutions such as
Citibank to find homes for their money.
It went mostly into commodity trades and trade finance deals where, in
return for a fee, Citibank, for example, arranged for a trader to buy goods
on Islamic banks' behalf and resell them at a mark-up.
More and more western banks went hunting for Islamic money, and an estimated
10 per cent is channelled through western banks, mainly Citibank, Kleinwort
Benson, ANZ Grindlays and Goldman Sachs.
At the same time, spurred by the swelling of deposits at Islamic banks -
Islamic funds of this kind, mostly spread through the Middle East and
south-east Asia, are estimated to be growing by 10 to 15 per cent a year -
commercial banks in the Gulf have opened their own 'Islamic windows' to
attract religious clients.
Saudi Arabia, for example, has resisted granting licences to Islamic
institutions lest this highlight the fact that the kingdom's banks deal in
interest.
The only Islamic bank with a licence to operate is Al Rajhi Banking &amp;
Investment, which for years had a monopoly on Islamic money and now boasts
Dollars 6bn in deposits. But all other Saudi banks today offer Islamic
products, such as commodity or trade finance funds.
Faced with more choices, depositors have become more demanding. Instead of
gladly leaving all their savings in current accounts, they have asked to
share in the bank's profits. While interest is shunned in the Koran, profit
is permitted. This has forced banks to enhance their yields, in turn
squeezing the margins provided to western banks.
But Islamic banks have a problem: while they continue to have plenty of
liquidity, they suffer from a dearth of products that can pass muster with
their religious boards which clear every transaction. Thus they will
continue to seek the product innovations western banks can offer.
'What we provide is access to markets and structuring capabilities,'
explains Mr Richard Duncan, director of Islamic finance at ANZ International
Merchant Banking. 'We bring our expertise in the Far East to our
relationships in the Gulf.'
With the help of banks such as ANZ, Gulf Islamic banks have managed in the
past two years to branch out of trade finance and into longer term and more
profitable asset-based transactions. Leasing is at the top of acceptable
Islamic products - Islamic banks can buy the equipment and sell it in
instalments. Three years ago, 0.4 per cent of Al Rajhi's assets were
invested over five years, compared with 10 per cent in 1993.
ANZ last year arranged for Al Rajhi to lend Dollars 92m in bridge finance to
Pakistan's Dollars 1.9bn Hub Power project, one of the largest privately
owned power projects implemented on a build-own-operate basis in the
developing world. Al Rajhi bought equipment on Hub Power's behalf and resold
it on a deferred payment basis.
ANZ also tapped Islamic money recently to arrange a Dollars 300m three-year
finance of raw material purchases for a New Zealand company. Since 1989 ANZ
has arranged for 10 deals each worth Dollars 100m, says Mr Duncan.
Islamic institutions are slowly acquiring expertise of their own, by
recruiting western trained professionals and offering them handsome pay
packages.
The most vibrant of newcomers is Kuwait's The International Investor, an
Islamic merchant bank set up in 1992 with Saudi and Kuwaiti institutional
shareholdings.
TII, which has Dollars 900m under management, will be looking to
OECD-country banks to source deals in the west and the Far East but it can
do without them in the Middle East. Last year TII raised Dollars 450m in
Islamic money to finance leases for seven Kuwait Airways aircraft. The bank
is now helping Merrill Group of the US raise Dollars 50m to build a wind
power generation plant in Egypt.
Faced with increased competition for Islamic money, but secure in the
knowledge that there is plenty more to tap, Citibank, say Islamic bankers,
is hoping to gain an edge by going directly to itors.
It is unlikely that small religious depositors will flock to the doors of a
western bank, however Islamic it claims to be. Perhaps with this in mind,
Citibank says it will target private individuals and institutions who want
to follow the Koran's teachings but are interested in making some money.
Though returns offered by Islamic institutions have improved in recent
years, they often remain below those offered by commercial counterparts.
Kuwait Finance House, which claims a 15 per cent share of all deposits in
Kuwait, has been paying a 5.6 per cent return this year on deposits of more
than 30 days compared with commercial Kuwaiti banks' 7 per cent rate,
according to Cyprus-based Capital Intelligence, a research group. (Though
quoted as an interest rate, Kuwait Finance House's 5.6 per cent rate is
based on profit sharing).
'If you make a living without having to fight for it, why go into tougher
business?' Mr Adnan Al Bahar, chairman of TII, said. 'As Islamic banks
become more competitive and offer competitive yields, the industry will
grow.'
The growth of Islamic finance, however, also requires the establishment of
Islamic capital markets, where long-term assets on banks' books are turned
into tradeable securities and where banks can find daily liquidity.
Malaysia has made strides towards this goal. The government has promoted the
establishment of Islamic banks alongside commercial ones and has set up an
Islamic interbank market.
This is unlikely to happen in the Gulf, where banks are spread across
borders and a product deemed Islamic by one bank is heresy for another. As
one expert in Islamic banking put it: 'The problem is that there is no
standard interpretation of the sharia (Islamic law). How can you have a
market if not everybody agrees which products are Islamic?'

FT  07 OCT 94 / Camdessus stands ground over SDR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund,
yesterday expressed confidence that there would soon be agreement on the
vexed issue of a distribution of special drawing rights - the Fund's reserve
asset - to its members, writes Peter Norman, Economics Editor, in Madrid.
But at a press conference marking the end of this year's IMF and World Bank
annual meetings, Mr Camdessus appeared to cast doubt on a resolution of the
issue by making clear he was sticking by his own proposal for the issue of
SDR36bn (Pounds 33.55bn).
This proposal, which was rejected by the Group of Seven leading industrial
countries at a difficult meeting of the IMF's policy-making interim
committee on Sunday, is at the higher end of suggestions for the allocation
of the IMF's own reserve assets to boost world monetary reserves.
Yesterday's press conference was striking for the passion that the SDR issue
generated in Mr Camdessus. He misheard or misunderstood questions about the
global economy and financial markets, giving answers that related to the SDR
allocation instead.
The managing director's continued zeal for the SDR contrasted with the
approach of many industrial country governments in recent days. Following
the interim committee, they made a determined effort to ring-fence the
stand-off over the SDR allocation, in an attempt to convey the message that
the world economy is now in a better state than in many years and has a good
chance of achieving sustained non-inflationary growth.
Mr Camdessus said there was 'a reasonable hope and probably a little bit
more than that' for early agreement on a package comprising an SDR
allocation and a strengthening of the systemic transformation facility (STF)
which the IMF uses to support former communist countries developing
market-based economies.
'I am confident that in the coming weeks we will have an agreement on this
package,' he said.
He said work had been progressing 'in the corridors' since Sunday's interim
committee failed to agree the SDR allocation and SFT strengthening. He
claimed the differences among the IMF members were 'not that big'.
According to Mr Camdessus, all governments recognised that:
There should be an SDR allocation.
The STF, which is due to expire at the end of 1994, should be extended
beyond the end of this year.
A solution to the SDR problem must be found that conforms with the Fund's
articles and that the SDR's role in the international monetary system must
be preserved.
He admitted there were differences about the size and structure of the
allocation. But he believed it was possible the IMF's 179 members could
reach agreement on the issue inside the Fund's executive board and before
the next interim committee meeting in April.
Mr Camdessus acknowledged that no one, including the IMF management, could
be certain their proposals would be supported by all the membership. But he
saw no reason to withdraw his own plan.
He showed no sign of moving towards other proposals for a smaller SDR
allocation, such as the SDR16bn one-off special allocation backed by the
Group of Seven leading industrial countries or suggestions from other
countries for issues of SDR22bn and SDR30bn.
Indeed, Mr Camdessus insisted his SDR36bn plan was essential to restore the
place of the SDR in global reserves to the average of the past 20 years. He
insisted his plan would have no inflationary consequences for the world
economy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Monitoring systems and equipment for the long-term surveillance of Iraq's
weapons industry are 'provisionally operational' and the UN monitoring
programme will begin in a few days, Mr Rolf Ekeus, UN special envoy, said in
Baghdad yesterday.
Mr Ekeus' findings will be put formally to the UN Security Council on
Monday. His report is likely to prompt debate and probable division among
Security Council members over whether to give Iraq a definite timetable for
a 'probationary' test of the system, at the end of which the Council would
consider easing the four-year-old oil embargo.
Iraqi officials warned after Mr Ekeus' departure that unless the Security
Council meeting on October 10 directly led to an easing of sanctions,
Baghdad would adopt a 'new attitude' towards the UN.
A spokesman for the Revolutionary Command Council, Iraq's top political
body, said that despite Iraq's compliance with UN Gulf war ceasefire
resolutions, 'those of vicious purpose, among them the US, are bent on
harming Iraq'.
Adding that some UN countries wanted 'to continue the sanctions as long as
possible, he said: 'We shall wait until the 10th of this month; after that
every party will bear the consequences of its stand'.
France, Russia, China and other members of the 15-strong Security Council
favour giving Iraq a six-month trial period, arguing Iraq has made progress
in meeting Gulf war ceasefire resolutions calling for control of its weapons
industries. Britain and the US have said they would oppose just yet setting
any criteria offering Iraq the prospect of lifting the oil sales ban.

A West Bank settler rabbi was yesterday accused of being themastermind of an

other crimes.

massacre, also was a resident, is the fourth member of the alleged
underground to be charged. His lawyer, Mr Naftali Wurzburger, said the rabbi
made no secret of his views on killing Arabs 'if it spares your own people,'
but argued that merely to hold those views was no crime.
On Wednesday, two other Kiryat Arba residents, brothers Eitan and Yehoyada
Kahalani, were charged with attempted murder.
More than a dozen people, most of them from Kiryat Arba, have been arrested
in connection with the alleged underground movement over the past month. The
members of the network may have been responsible for four murders of Arabs
in the past year, and may have been planning an attack on the PLO's orient
house headquarters in Jerusalem.
However, more than half of those originally detained have been released. In
addition, settler leaders have been charging that no extremist Jewish
underground really exists. They claim the government has deliberately used
agents of the Shin Bet security services to target right-wing settler groups
which oppose its peace policies.
With the Cave of the Patriarchs, where Goldstein gunned down 29 Palestinians
at prayer, scheduled to finally reopen later this month, the government is
keen to minimise the threat from settler extremists.
Earlier this week, 18 settlers were issued with orders banning them from
visiting the Hebron shrine.

Attempts to invigorate Indonesia's battered media received another setback
yesterday when the government threatened to ban a relaunched weekly tabloid,
which had been forced to close in June.
The official state-backed journalists' association, the PWI, withdrew its
support for the editor of Simponi, a reorganised version of DeTik launched
on Monday. Journalists say the association is acting on instructions from
the ministry of information and the move 'lays the ground for an eventual
ban'.
According to the many rules laid down by the ministry of information, a
publication's editors and journalists must be endorsed by the PWI to obtain
a publishing licence. Critics say the ministry is simply looking for a
technical excuse to close down Simponi, arguing that almost all publications
in Indonesia hire employees not members of the journalists' association.
Mr Subrata, director-general of press and graphics at the department of
information, was not available and other officials declined to comment.
Simponi went on sale on Tuesday with an initial print run of 150,000 copies,
featuring a cover story on the role of former President Sukarno in the 1965
coup d'etat. The tabloid's staff is made up of some 60 former DeTik
journalists, banned in June with two other leading publications, Tempo and
Editor, in what amounted to the most severe media crackdown in years.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Taipei puts its mouth where pleas and money used to be: A
new assertive approach to foreign relations is emerging
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At the opening ceremony of the Asian Games in Hiroshima this week, Taiwan
got the biggest ovation from the crowd as its delegation walked into the
arena.
It was a signal of a changing diplomatic game being played by the Taipei
government.
Taiwan, which was once content to plead its case for greater international
recognition merely through quiet lobbying, chequebook diplomacy and
full-page advertisements in international publications, was reaping some of
the first fruits of a quite different approach.
The humble, discreet, behind-the-scenes approach long used for fear of
arousing the wrath of China and causing offence to other governments,
appears now to be taking second place to a more assertive, even aggressive
approach to foreign relations.
The island is fighting to emerge from the shadow of diplomatic isolation
cast over it since 1971, when the United Nations switched recognition from
Taipei to Beijing.
President Lee Teng-hui in 1993 announced a seemingly quixotic bid to return
to the UN with the words 'Hope is more important than reality, for without
hope, how can one expect to achieve reality?'
China vehemently opposes Taiwanese membership, and as a permanent member of
the UN's security council was able to block efforts last month and in the
autumn of 1993 by Taiwan's friends to have the matter brought before the UN
general assembly.
China regards Taiwan as a renegade province, and forces governments to
choose between Taipei and Beijing for their diplomatic relations.
Just 29 countries now recognise Taiwan, and it is debatable how long the
biggest of those, South Africa, will hold out against Beijing's advances now
that it is no longer the pariah state it was under apartheid.
Governments that do not have formal ties with Taiwan are attempting to gauge
what sort of entity Taiwan will be a few years hence and how their policies
should reflect expected changes.
The new (unstated) policy first materialised in May, when the US government,
under pressure from China, refused to allow Taiwan's president, Lee
Teng-hui, stay overnight in Hawaii en route to central America. Taiwan
gained a lot of sympathy and publicity in the US as it sought to portray
Washington as Beijing's lapdog.
Then Taiwan used a dispute with Beijing over whether a Taiwanese official
should be allowed to attend the Asian Games to stir debate in Japan.
The incident worked to great effect as China co-operatively kicked up a fuss
at every opportunity, real or imagined. Especially galling to Beijing was
when Taiwan's deputy premier, Mr Hsu Li-teh, exchanged name-cards with
Japan's education minister.
Then there was that ovation at the opening ceremony.
On Monday Taiwan plans to wave its red national flag in front of the Chinese
bull with a gala Taiwanese national day celebration in Hong Kong's cultural
centre.
Observers are wondering what sort of international spectacle may emerge at
the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum to be held in Jakarta in
November.
'This is part of Taiwan's two-pronged strategy,' said a Taipei-based western
observer. 'First, the government is trying to stir up public sympathy in
countries with strong legislative support for Taiwan. Second, they've
discovered that it is quite easy to provoke outrage from Beijing, and the
more Beijing bullies Taiwan, the stupider the Chinese look.' Taiwan comes
off looking reasonable, even gracious, in contrast.
Perhaps policy-makers decided that the old diplomatic methods were not
achieving the desired result, so there was nothing to be lost by trying a
new approach.
The new confrontational Taiwan has foreign governments bemused, but on
guard, fearing they may be targetted next.
But hardliners in Taiwan warn that openly provoking Beijing could lead to a
military attack. China has not ruled out using force to stop Taiwan from
declaring independence.
Supporters of independence dismiss such warnings as scaremongering. They
believe that China would not dare attack Taiwan, and if it did, the US would
rush to Taiwan's defence despite the absence of such a treaty.
While it is evident that no government will risk forfeiting access to
China's vast potential market to further Taiwan's diplomatic ambitions, it
is equally evident that Taiwan's current status is not tenable indefinitely.
Sympathy for Taiwan is growing in the US Congress, the Japanese Diet
(parliament) and in the legislatures of other western countries. Already
lawmakers are pressing their governments to grant Taiwan better treatment.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Turning point may be near in Korean N-talks
</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The possibility that Mr Kim Jong-il, son of the late President Kim Il-sung,
will be named North Korean president and head of the ruling party next week
after the 100-day mourning for his father may remove uncertainty over the
extent of the new leader's control in Pyongyang.
Statements by North Korean officials referring to Mr Kim as the 'supreme
leader' led diplomats to believe a turning point may soon be reached in
nuclear talks between the US and North Korea, which resumed at high level in
Geneva on Wednesday after a five-day break.
'With no one in confident overall command, it is most unlikely North Korean
officials would take responsibility for reaching agreement,' said a western
diplomat. 'To have a properly appointed leader must be a step forward.'
Diplomats expressed caution over Mr Kim's influence on the talks, saying it
was impossible to predict whether he would take the same hard line as his
father or a more conciliatory one. Negotiations centre on an international
aid package to switch North Korea's nuclear programme from
graphite-moderated reactors to safer light-water versions.
In a preliminary accord reached on August 12, Pyongyang agreed to freeze its
nuclear programme in return for light-water technology and diplomatic ties
with Washington. But, in talks since then, North Korean officials have put
up a series of new demands which Washington calls unacceptable.
The talks have been consistently described as 'serious and businesslike' by
both sides, but many observers fear North Korea is simply seeking to gain
time to pursue its nuclear ambitions and stave off economic sanctions.
Reports from Washington say the Clinton administration has decided not to
give ground to Pyongyang but to maintain its August offer and hope this will
eventually be accepted. With American forces engaged in Haiti and mid-term
elections next month, the US has no interest in precipitating a
confrontation.
AlThough North Korea denies a nuclear weapons programme, it continues to
refuse access to two suspected nuclear waste sites at the Yongbyon nuclear
complex. The International Atomic Energy Agency believes inspection of these
sites could provide clues to what has happened to plutonium missing from an
experimental 5MW nuclear reactor.
In last week's Geneva talks Mr Kang Sok-ju, North Korea's first deputy
foreign minister, apparently rejected even a rough timetable for such
inspections which the US insists must be part of any final deal.
Other unresolved issues concern the roughly 8,000 spent reactor-fuel rods in
a holding pond at Yongbyon which the US wants shipped out of the country,
and North Korea's demands for cash compensation for ending its
graphite-moderated reactor programme.

FT  07 OCT 94 / India puts priority onpower supply boost: Without it,
ministers see their hopes of economic growth as doomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The electricity situation 'is rather grim and the prospects are also rather
grim,' says Mr N K P Salve, India's power minister, talking about the
country's power shortages. Right on cue, the lights and the air-conditioning
in his ministry go off and do not come on again for the next half hour.
Mr Salve puts a brave face on his discomfort in the sweltering heat, saying:
'If there is load-shedding it should be first in the ministry'.
Better power management has so far this year spared Delhi the extended
breakdowns it suffered in 1993 but sporadic cuts are just as frequent, even
in the power minister's office.
The only remedy is a sustained expansion of generating and transmission
capacity, combined with more efficient use of the existing network.
'We must carry on with the struggle not only to increase capacity but
improve transmission and distribution,' says Mr Salve, mopping the sweat
from his brow.
From the outset, Mr P V Narasimha Rao's government has put a high priority
on improving power supplies.
Ministers recognise that without electricity, hopes of promoting economic
growth through liberalisation are doomed. Because of the squeeze on public
spending, the government has welcomed private investment into the
state-dominated industry.
However, since power plants take years to plan and build, privately-funded
plants are unlikely to make a significant contribution until the next
century.
Mr Salve says government planners in the early 1990s estimated that India
would need to boost its generating capacity of 70,000MW by 48,000MW in
1992-97 to meet expected demand increases.
Because of financial constraints, the target for the five years was cut to
30,500MW. Mr Salve says the total increase will now be less than 20,000MW,
including 3,000MW of privately-owned extra capacity.
Shortages in early 1997 will be about 14-15 per cent of normal requirements
and 28-30 per cent of peak demand, about the same level as today, says Mr
Salve. 'That's why I say the prospects are grim.'
Mr Salve spends much of his time promoting private investment in the
industry as the only way to secure the long-term future. His officials say
binding contracts for the first four new private-sector schemes could be
signed in the next few months.
Potential investors, including foreign investors, say this is optimistic,
given the hurdles they face. Partly the problems are due to bureaucratic
barriers and partly to the fact that private-sector power projects are new
in the developing world, so there are few precedents.
Mr Salve says that despite liberalisation, investors still require 15-17
separate clearances. Also, responsibility for power is shared between Delhi
and India's constituent states, some of which are slow to welcome private
investors, he says.
But, pointing out that 75 schemes have attracted interest from private
investors, including foreign groups, Mr Salve adds: 'If companies are
responding, it's because they find the Indian atmosphere congenial'.
If increasing generating capacity is hard work, improving the efficiency of
the transmission and distribution system is even more difficult, mainly
because distribution is in the hands of the states.
Mr Salve says state politicians have forced state electricity boards to
operate 'imprudently', distributing free or low-cost power to farmers and
other favoured consumers.
'This very pernicious system' has landed the electricity boards with
mounting losses: Rs50bn (Pounds 1.03bn) in the year to March 1994, up from
Rs34bn three years ago, before economic reforms began.
But there is some progress. Late last year, state power ministers finally
agreed to charge farmers a minimum of Rs0.50 a unit for electricity. This is
still far below cost but establishes the principle that consumers pay. Mr
Salve says 17 of the 26 state electricity boards have introduced the new
charge.
States which have yet to reform include Uttar Pradesh, the most populous,
and Punjab, the largest agricultural producer.
The position is so poor that the World Bank, the biggest foreign source of
finance for Indian power, has this year withheld Dollars 750m (Pounds 500m)
in planned loans because of the slowness in reforming electricity boards.
Another of Mr Salve's headaches is that state electricity boards buy much of
their power from the centrally-run National Thermal Power Corporation but
consistently fail to pay their dues.
The arrears, totalling Rs30bn, have become so alarming that Delhi took
extreme action to recover some of the money - by taking it out of the grants
paid by the government to state administrations.
It was the third time Delhi has had to pre-empt funds since 1991. Mr Salve
says: 'I hope it's the last time. We must accelerate the spread of economic
reform into the states.'

FT  07 OCT 94 / Aborigines turn to land fund for redress: The ink had barely
dried on the Native Title act when problems started surfacing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Less than a year since Australia made a kind of peace with its indigenous
population, the question of Aboriginal rights threatens to become
politically contentious again.
In December last year, the federal parliament passed a law allowing
Aborigines and Torres Strait islanders to assert native title claims over
the country's large land mass. If claims were valid and land had since been
put to other uses, compensation would be paid. This was the first formal
acknowledgment - other than a 1992 High Court ruling - that the country was
inhabited before European settlement.
But, with the implementation of that package caught in a tussle between
federal and state authorities, the focus is turning to a ADollars 1.5bn
(Pounds 700m) land fund, designed to help those indigenous people who have
little chance of benefiting from the Native Title act itself.
In theory, the land fund is a good idea. The problem with last December's
law was that it required an indigenous community to demonstrate a 'close and
continuing' association with the land it was claiming. Many Aborigines,
however, have moved from their original homelands.
To some extent, this drift has been voluntary. But it has also been due in
part to the behaviour of white settlers. Aboriginal leaders estimate that no
more than 10 per cent of their people have any chance of benefiting directly
from the new law.
So, in the lengthy negotiations leading up to Native Title Act's passage,
they wrung a promise from the government that a fund would be set up to
acquire land on behalf of the remaining 90 per cent - a concession some saw
as of more practical significance than the main legislation. The government
published details earlier this year, and the necessary legislation is
working its way through parliament in Canberra.
The problem is that interested parties on all sides have reservations about
the scheme's design. Some Aboriginal representatives say the fund is too
small to be viable, and that the administrative framework is offensively
paternalistic.
Opposition politicians, by contrast, have argued the money could be better
spent on Aborginal health and housing. They have offered a raft of
amendments, saying they will only support the legislation if these are
accepted. It took the government only hours to reject this proposition.
But perhaps the most critical views, from a political standpoint, are those
of the minor parties who hold the balance of power in the senate,
parliament's upper house, through which any legislation must pass. Already,
the two Green party senators, who hail from Western Australia and hence have
an important Aboriginal constituency, have expressed serious concerns about
the fund's parameters.
'The question is whether this becomes yet another Native Title debate,' said
one official at the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Commission
(ATSIC), which represents Aboriginal interests. He was referring to the
mammoth parliamentary effort which was needed to ensure the original bill's
passage. 'The Greens are playing the same role - trying to extract more
(from the federal government),' he added.
The objectors have a point. The fund is less generous than it originally
appeared. The ADollars 1.5bn figure mentioned in the last budget is made up
of a ADollars 200m contribution from federal coffers in 1994/5, and ADollars
121m a year for the next nine years.
The bulk of this money, moreover, will be invested to ensure the fund is
self-sustaining after the first decade. Only ADollars 45m out of each annual
payment will go to acquire land, or to fund land management. Moreover, funds
ATSIC already devotes to this purpose from its own budget - ADollars 21m a
year - will be incorporated in the ADollars 45m figure.
ATSIC has taken the view that any increase is better than none, and that,
having done its best in negotiations, it will support the bill as it stands.
But it is not overjoyed. As David Ross, ATSIC commissioner, has put it: 'I
think the fund is adequate . . . I am certainly not saying that it is
over-generous.'
Other Aboriginal representatives are more critical. Mr Aden Ridgeway,
director of the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council, who represents the
interests of indigenous people in that state, has pointed out that the
annual funding works out at ADollars 5.5m per state or territory, and that
this low level will force the land fund to spread its money around
second-grade properties.
'You will not get really viable land when you do not have much money to
spend,' he warned. 'You will end up with land in the low rainfall area which
obviously will not be productive and viable.'
Equally thorny are the questions of how land purchases will be organised and
prioritised. The legislation is thin on operational details, but it does
provide for the formation of a new body, the Indigenous Land Corporation, to
handle purchases and management. After some compromise, the ILC's
prospective board has been extended to seven, and the chairperson plus at
least four other directors must be Aborigines or Torres Strait Islanders.
Even so, the fact that these appointments are to be made by a federal
minister and that the federal finance minister has ultimate power over the
land fund's investment touches a nerve. It smacks, in some eyes, of
condescension, even racism.
Moreover, in the first three years, the ADollars 45m will be divided between
ATSIC and the ILC, with the latter taking on full responsibility after this
interim period. Sorting out how these bodies weigh up the mass of
applications which will almost certainly be presented,and perform
complementary investment roles, is no easy task. As one ATSIC adminstrator
points out, it is not a question of maximising financial returns. Outback
land of spiritual significance, for example, might have to be weighed
against the desire of an urban group to build a local community centre.
There is a fair amount of goodwill surrounding the land fund discussions.
There is also considerable reluctance to repeat the trauma of the main
legislation. Nevertheless, as Australia found last year, the road to
reconciliation is long and bumpy.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Top Yugoslav military chiefs are dismissed
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three senior officers in the Serb-controlled Yugoslav armed forces have been
removed from their posts, in line with a general shift in Serbian policy
towards a Bosnian peace settlement.
The head of the navy, Admiral Dojicilo Isakovic, and two commanders from the
army, General Jevrem Cokic and General Bozidar Djokic, were officially
retired, according to a military communique published in Belgrade yesterday.
Observers said they believed the dismissals signalled the start of changes
aimed at removing officers most closely associated with Serbian President
Slobodan Milosovic's former nationalist policies.
'Many officers in the army are unhappy with Milosovic's move against the
Bosnian Serbs. We are now seeing him move against those who oppose the new
policy and other nationalist figures who threaten to rock the boat,' said
one diplomat.
Last week the leader of the nationalist Serbian Radical party, Mr Vojislav
Seselj, was arrested and jailed on charges of threatening members of the
Yugoslav parliament. Mr Seselj, a leader of a Serbian paramilitary group, is
believed to be one of those responsible for Serb atrocities in Bosnia and
has openly criticised Mr Milosovic's break with the Bosnian Serbs.
The Serbian president cut links with his former proteges, the Bosnian Serbs,
in early August to try to force them into accepting a peace plan. The
rejection of the plan by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, was a
blow to Mr Milosovic who is facing increasing economic problems in Serbia
and Montenegro and needs a peace settlement.
Since the rebuff, coverage of the war in Bosnia has virtually disappeared
from the government-controlled media.
The dismissal of three generals comes against a backdrop of dissatisfaction
in the armed forces. Earlier this week there were reports that the Yugoslav
army's chief of staff, Gen Momcilo Perisic, had threatened to resign over a
planned 30 per cent increase in army salaries. Wages and living standards
for the armed forces have dropped sharply since the break-up of Yugoslavia
and morale is low.
There is also jealousy of the police force, whose power and prestige have
been built up by Mr Milosovic since the war in Yugoslavia began in 1991. The
number of police officers is estimated to have more than doubled to 110,000.

United Nations peacekeepers yesterday found the corpses of 16 Serb soldiers
and four female medics, many of them mutilated or burned, near Sarajevo, Our
Foreign Staff reports. The Bosnian Serb army blamed Moslem-led Bosnian
government forces and responded menacingly to the carnage near a
demilitarised zone patrolled by the UN by warning it could trigger an
explosion of fighting in the region. Government troops have been moving
through the zone recently, prompting repeated complaints from UN officials
to Bosnian government and military leaders.
The Bosnian Serbs' leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, said they might demand a UN
withdrawal from the area. They were also reconsidering their promise to let
a vital UN airlift to the Bosnian capital resume after a two-week break.
The discovery of the bodies marred attempts to resolve disputes between the
warring parties which included an exchange of 295 prisoners yesterday. UN
special envoy Yasushi Akashi, who had earlier announced the reopening of the
city's airport, urged 'maximum self-restraint on both warring parties'.

FT  07 OCT 94 / EU enlargement threat emerges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Plans to bring Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway into the European Union
in January could be dashed by a byzantine intra-EU struggle. The difficulty
has emerged only days after the Union drew up a road map for the integration
of six east and central European states.
The root cause of the squabble is Italy, where Mr Silvio Berlusconi's
government has refused to ratify the EU budget increase planned for next
year until its partners retroactively condone Italy's cheating on EU milk
quotas.
The enlargement is affected because Spain will not ratify the EU expansion
from 12 to 16 members unless the decision to raise the Union's revenue
ceiling, reached by the December 1992 Edinburgh summit, is legally secure.
The Edinburgh decision provides the extra money for EU structural aid and
'cohesion' spending in poorer member states, a main beneficiary of which is
Spain. Unless all 12 parliaments ratify the extra money, Spain's endorsement
of enlargement to the Union's north is 'out of the question', said a Spanish
official. He said the decision had all but been taken by Madrid. 'This is a
real problem,' said an EU official after foreign ministers again failed to
resolve the Italian milk wrangle in Luxembourg this week. Finance ministers
will make another attempt on Monday.
There are growing fears in Brussels that the squabble could exacerbate
anti-EU sentiment in Finland, Sweden and Norway - due to hold referendums on
entry to the Union on October 16, November 13, and November 28 respectively
 -as well as more general north-south antipathy within Europe.
Any delay in EU ratification of the new entrants, moreover, could unravel
the financial and agriculture deals the Twelve struck with them, according
to a leading EU negotiator in this spring's enlargement talks.
Italy has been fighting the milk issue since it threatened to block the
landmark reform of the common agricultural policy in May 1992. It backed
down then but has brought the issue to successive EU summits.
Rome had agreed to cut its excess milk output in exchange for a quota
increase amounting to a third of the illicit surplus. This spring, Brussels
said Italy had not cut enough, but the incoming Berlusconi government then
produced new figures claiming its output had been overestimated.
Germany, the UK, Netherlands and Denmark have resisted pressure to wipe out
most of the fine on Italy's excess production. But these four states are
also the greatest enthusiasts for enlargement. Spain's threat therefore
increases the probability that a means will be found to buy Italy off.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Austria's coalition under electoral siege: The socialist and
conservative hold on power is beginning to weaken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A big upheaval is in the making in Austrian politics, as an increasingly
fractious 'grand coalition' of Social Democrats and conservatives begins to
tear apart.
The rupture will probably not be set off immediately by this Sunday's
national elections. The coalition that has ruled the country since 1986 will
almost certainly carry on in the short term, if only to guide Austria
smoothly into the European Union at the start of next year. But it could
break up well before the next scheduled election in 1998, clearing the way
for a political and economic overhaul.
The socialists and conservatives have managed, in a cozy partnership,
virtually every aspect of economic and social life in Austria since the
second world war. Together they set up carefully balanced power structures
for employers, workers and farmers and staffed the nationalised industries
and financial institutions with their supporters.
As long as the two parties had the support of most Austrians and as long as
competence was not too important a factor in filling key positions, this
so-called Proporz system could thrive. But as a privatisation programme
gathers pace and the country opens itself to EU competition rules, it no
longer works.
Early this week, for example, only 30 per cent of workers bothered to vote
in elections to their Arbeiterkammer, a counter lobby to the employers'
Chamber of Commerce. Most workers know their chamber has less influence on
their lives and careers than Brussels bureaucrats.
In Sunday's election the Social Democratic party (SPO) and the conservative
Austrian People's party (OVP), which between them polled more than 80 per
cent of the votes in 1986, will be lucky to collect two-thirds.
The legitimacy of reserving government and government-controlled jobs for
supporters would thus be brought increasingly into question.
This is the kind of environment in which new and fringe political movements
grow, and Austria is no exception.
So far none constitutes a serious threat to the two old parties, but the
Austrian Freedom party (FPO), under the leadership of Mr Jorg Haider, a
charismatic right-winger, could change that on Sunday.
Mr Haider took control of the FPO, a flagging party with a mixed liberal and
Nazi heritage, in 1986, purged its leaders and turned it into a rowdy
protest movement against the self-serving socialist-conservative
partnership. Now every time a party supporter gets a high-paying sinecure,
Mr Haider brays about 'rotten' patronage.
When the iron curtain fell in 1989 he began appealing to Austrians' fears of
being overrun by asylum seekers and other immigrants. He maintains that
foreigners are taking over Austrians' jobs and benefiting excessively from
government welfare payments, while crime rates are soaring and the quality
of education is declining.
With these themes and his opposition to European integration, Mr Haider has
more than doubled the FPO's support to 22 per cent, not far below the OVP's
28 per cent, according to opinion polls. Normally this would make the party
an alternative coalition partner for one of the two main parties. But Mr
Haider's rhetoric, which often appeals to xenophobic and racist sentiments,
has made him a pariah.
'Haider's FPO is no alternative for us - which I regret,' Mr Erhard Busek,
leader of the conservative OVP, said on Wednesday.
However, such is the frustration within the OVP with being the junior
partner in the governing coalition that another of its leaders, foreign
minister Alois Mock, said last week that the party should rethink its stance
on Mr Haider. 'It certainly would do democracy in this country no harm if
the socialists went into opposition for a few years,' Mr Mock said in a
magazine interview.
The socialists have been more successful than the OVP in preventing erosion
of their support, mainly because of the popularity of Mr Franz Vranitzky,
their moderate and competent leader. But they too have struggled in the
current campaign, hurt by losses to Mr Haider in a provincial election two
weeks ago, revelations of huge salaries being paid to leaders of the Chamber
of Labour and an insensitive remark from Mr Vranitzky's wife criticising
mothers who left their children to work.
Meanwhile, on the left, the Greens have gone some way to transforming
themselves and their leader, Ms Madeleine Petrovic, into a responsible
force. Their standing in the polls has risen from 4.8 per cent in 1990 to 8
per cent.
And the Liberal Forum, formed last year by defectors from Mr Haider's party
and led by Ms Heide Schmidt, is hoping to break through the 4 per cent
barrier needed to win a share of the 183 parliamentary seats.

Bosnian Serb and Moslem troops completed an exchange of prisoners of war in

Whittington. The prisoner swap - involving 129 Serbs and 166 Moslems - took
place at the Brotherhood Unit Bridge in the beseiged capital early in the
morning. Mr Yasushi Akashi, UN envoy, said he hoped the swap would help ease
other problems between the warring sides. He also announced the reopening of
Sarajevo airport following talks with the Bosnian Serb leadership on
Wednesday. The airport was closed by Serbs on September 22.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government yesterday decided to press a formal complaint against
Mr Saverio Borrelli, Milan's chief public prosecutor, over a newspaper
interview on Wednesday that contained allegations about the prime minister
and the justice minister.
The move followed 24 hours' deliberation as Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime
minister, sought to present a united front among the members of his
right-wing coalition over how to react to the controversial interview.
The complaint is being filed with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, as head of
the higher council of the magistrature. It claims Mr Borrelli is in breach
of article 289 of the criminal code for undermining constitutional
authority.
Such a strong stand represents the triumph of the 'hawks' in the cabinet,
led by Mr Giuliano Ferrara, minister in charge of parliamentary affairs.
They have argued that the government must take tough action to curb the
increasing political interference of the anti-corruption magistrates in
Milan.
But the unity of the government was immediately put in doubt by Mr Umberto
Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League. He distanced himself from the
stand of the four League ministers who signed the complaint, saying: 'The
League doesn't make denunciations of any type.'
At the same time key members of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance - Mr
Berlusconi's other main coalition partner - also kept their distance. The
MSI has been cultivating close relations with elements in the Milan
magistrature and is anxious to avoid an open confrontation, aware of the
continued popularity of figures such as Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the leading
anti-corruption magistrate.
The complaint procedure means that Mr Scalfaro must now examine the evidence
and then decide whether there is sufficient cause to take either
disciplinary or legal action. Offences under article 289 carry a minimum of
10 years' imprisonment.
Mr Borrelli was unrepentant over his interview yesterday and told reporters
he had no intention of resigning. His comments suggested he was aware of the
consequences of his words in the interview and accepted that the
confrontation between the government and the judiciary was likely to
continue.
In the interview, Mr Borrelli claimed the magistrates' investigations were
at a turning point and involved people 'at the top of business and
politics'. This was a clear reference to Mr Berlusconi and his Fininvest
empire, which has been under investigation for more than a year.

President Giadar Aliyev of Azerbaijan yesterday sacked Mr Suret Huseinov as
prime minister, threatening further instability in the Caucasian state.
Earlier in the week President Aliyev had accused Mr Huseinov of siding with
opposition forces trying to incite a coup. Mr Huseinov vigorously denied the
charge and declared his support for President Aliyev while standing uneasily
by his side at a public meeting in Baku this week. The Interfax newsagency
reported that seven rebels had been killed this week when Azerbaijani
government troops crushed an uprising in Gence, Azerbaijan's second city,
which was also Mr Huseinov's power base. Last year Mr Huseinov, a wealthy
businessman, successfully fomented an uprising against the then president
and forged an unstable power-sharing deal with President Aliyev. Russia
yesterday continued to deny it was in any way involved in the crisis, saying
it regarded Azerbaijan as a friendly partner in the Commonwealth of
Independent States.

Finland is set to vote decisively in favour of joining the European Union in
a referendum on October 16, according to two opinion polls published
yesterday. One exit poll taken among voters who had already cast postal
ballots showed 67.6 per cent backing EU membership. A second, conventional,
opinion poll showed support for EU membership had risen 10 points to 48 per
cent in two weeks, while opposition had slipped by three points to 28 per
cent. The poll found most of the 24 per cent undecided leaning to the Yes
side.
A decisive vote for membership in Finland would give a strong boost to the
Yes campaigns in neighbouring Sweden and Norway which will hold similar
referendums in November. Latest polls in Sweden show a narrow lead for the
Yes side while in Norway, the polls continue to show a solid majority
against membership.

A 'one-stop telecommunications shop' has been set up by European governments
to promote greater competition in provision of telecoms services and help
harmonise licensing arrangements. Twenty European governments, including all
EU states except Ireland, have given their backing to the European
Telecommunications Office, which has been established in Copenhagen. The
European Commission sees the office as a key step in opening up Europe's
telecoms market to competition. Eleven governments, including all the EU

standardised application procedure for companies wishing to provide new or
competing telecoms services within their countries.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Soaring death rates and worsening health in eastern and central Europe
threaten social stability and the entire reform process, according to the
United Nations Childrens' Fund (Unicef) in a report published yesterday. The
fund estimates that, since the fall of communism in 1989, 800,000 more
people in the region have died than if 1989 death rates had prevailed. 'Such
a death toll, mainly among males aged 30-55 and across so many countries, is
without precedent in peacetime,' it says.
It attributes the mortality crisis to the stress of changing to a market
economy which has brought in its wake increased poverty, crime and breakdown
of the social and institutional fabric. Of the nine countries surveyed in
detail, Russia, Ukraine and south-eastern Europe were worst affected. In
Russia, male life expectancy at birth has plunged 5.2 years since 1989 to
just 59 years in 1993. However, the Czech Republic and Slovakia were largely
untouched, while Poland by 1993 showed signs of returning to pre-transition
mortality rates, the report notes. Unicef says most of the extra deaths were
caused by heart problems, alcohol and food poisoning, accidents, homicides
and suicides.

The OECD nudged up its forecasts for economic growth in the developed world
yesterday to 3 per cent both next year and in 1996 but warned its member
governments against a resurgence of inflation and widening budget deficits.
In its last semi-annual Economic Outlook, published in June, the think-tank
for rich nations forecast expansion of 2.9 per cent in 1995. It had also
projected growth of 2.6 per cent for this year. but sources close to the
forum said it was now counting on a slightly higher figure. The OECD sees
growth in the US slowing to a more sustainable rate following its brisk pace
over the past couple of years. For Europe, the OECD now predicts growth of
just over 2 per cent before a quickening to 3 per cent in 1995. In June its
forecasts had been 1.9 per cent and 2.8 per cent, respectively. The
International Monetary Fund last week projected global growth of 3 per cent
this year and 3.5 per cent in 1995.

The future of Estline, the Estonian-Swedish shipping line which operated the
doomed car ferry Estonia, was thrown into doubt last night when Nordstrom &amp;
Thulin, the Swedish half-owner of the company, announced it was pulling out
of passenger shipping following last week's disaster. The decision is a
further blow to the Estonian nation, already reeling from the catastrophe.
The state owns the other 50 per cent of Estline through the Estonian
Shipping Company.
Estline, which has a 10-year monopoly concession on the Stockholm-Tallinn
route, played a prestigious and important role in the economic development
of Estonia after the country won its independence from Moscow in 1991.
Nordstrom &amp; Thulin said it would seek a solution that allowed Estline to
continue in operation, but did not make clear how this would be done. The
Swedish company, which mainly operates tankers and bulk carriers, also
apologised for its initial public reaction to the disaster, which claimed
more than 900 lives when the Estonia sank in the Baltic Sea. Mr Ronald
Bergman, Nordstrom &amp; Thulin's managing director, asked for forgiveness for
the company's initial statement that it would not be financially hit because
it had full insurance cover and that the accident would not stop a
profitable business venture.

FT  07 OCT 94 / German Elections: Unemployment fails to excite German voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the depressed Lausitz region of east Germany, where some towns have a
jobless rate of more than 20 per cent, a trade union official says that
housing is a bigger election issue than unemployment. In Hamburg a Social
Democrat candidate for the Bundestag admits that no party has 'the easy
answers' to high unemployment. Not for the first time in a recent European
election both the parties and voters claim that combating mass unemployment
is their number one issue, yet they do not seem to believe it.
'There is a ritualistic quality to the debate, heightened by the fact that
the political extremes have not prospered from high joblessness and that
unemployment in both parts of Germany is now actually falling,' says Mr
Robert Leicht, editor of the liberal weekly paper Die Zeit.
It is true that the state of the labour market remains far from rosy.
Average unemployment in west Germany is 7.9 per cent and in east Germany is
13.8 per cent. Most economists believe that unemployment will fall only
slowly and could even rise again. They also point out that in many parts of
eastern Germany real joblessness is often double the official rate once
early retirement and state job creation are counted in.
Nevertheless, the Social Democratic party, which has placed most emphasis on
unemployment, does not seem to have benefitted thereby. Mr Rudolf Scharping,
the SPD leader, last week told a trade union conference in Hamburg that
there would be 700,000 fewer unemployed if the training measures of three
years ago were restored.
While the Christian Democrats place less stress on unemployment they are
strongly promoting an increase in part-time work, which headed a recent poll
on the best measures to reduce joblessness.
The CDU benefits from its image as the party of business, especially in east
Germany where the ability to attract new investment is regarded as crucial.
In west Germany there is still usually a correlation between areas of high
unemployment, such as Bremen, and voting for parties of the left. In east
Germany, where the political landscape has not yet settled, that is not the
case. Towns and regions are still shifting from right to left or vice versa,
often depending on local personalities, and some of the areas of highest
unemployment - in Saxony, for example - are strongly CDU.
The party of Democratic Socialism - the former east German communists - is
the only one calling for a positive right to employment. But judging from a
meeting last week in Cottbus, addressed by the former communist leader Mr
Hans Modrow, its support is drawn from the senior bureaucrats of the old
regime - many of whom have switched to running 'businesses' funded by
western grants - and not the eastern unemployed. Without any advertising, Mr
Modrow attracted about 250 people to his meeting. Later the same evening in
the main square in Cottbus, close to the Polish and Czech borders, Mr Oskar
Lafontaine, deputy leader of the SPD and one of the best speakers in German
politics, attracted only about 350.
Mr Lafontaine is not popular in east Germany. 'I hate him, he's a champagne
socialist who doesn't like easterners', said one worker in Sachsen Dorf, the
depressed suburb of Cottbus. His speech dwelt mainly on how he had told the
truth four years ago as SPD Chancellor candidate and how Chancellor Helmut
Kohl had lied about the economics of unification.
When he did eventually turn to the issue of unemployment - which has been as
high as 18 per cent in the Cottbus region - his audience seemed less not
more interested. 'Getting rid of the Russian troops was a bigger issue
here,' said one SPD official.

Norway is quietly pressing its Nato partners not to neglect its security at
a time when the strategic importance of Russian forces in the Arctic is
increasing.
Oslo's fear of being left out in the cold has been fuelled by the growing
preoccupation of Nato's south European members with the security threats
posed by Islamic extremism in North Africa and conflict in the Balkans.
Norway's Atlantic Committee - a lobby group supported by the main political
parties - has published a study arguing that Russia's northern fleet, based
in the Arctic, is emerging as much the most important part of the former
Soviet navy.
The Soviet collapse left the main bases of the Baltic and Black Sea fleets
outside Russian territory, and the lamentable state of Russian ships in the
Pacific was highlighted last year when several sailors died of malnutrition.
'The northern fleet appears more than ever before as the largest and most
important of the former Soviet fleets,' the study says.
Mr Ellmann Ellingsen, the committee's secretary-general, believes that once
the Start 2 treaty is implemented, more than half Russia's remaining
strategic nuclear warheads could be based on submarines less than 40 miles
from Norway.
While stressing that the Arctic fleet is well below its cold war peak, Mr
Ellingsen says Russia's tactical submarines have become more active
recently, sailing west of Iceland for the first time in several years.
Both Norway and Turkey have been alarmed by Russia's call for a revision of
the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty so as to increase the amount
of armour it is allowed to keep in the Leningrad and Transcaucasian military
districts.
The Norwegian study says the number of attack helicopters and tactical
aircraft in the Leningrad military district has increased since 1991, as
forces are withdrawn from central Europe. However, the level of aerial
activity remains low.
The study also expresses concern about the aircraft carrier Admiral
Kuznetsov, which is apparently being prepared to carry sophisticated Su-27
fighters. If the carrier's role turns out to be defending the Russian
Arctic, 'this would mean a special challenge to the security of the
neighbouring Nordic states'.
'We fully accept that Russia needs to have defences,' Mr Ellingsen said.
'But we are worried that Norway will be very vulnerable to any change in the
temperature between Washington and Moscow.'

The treason trial of six pro-Kurdish former MPs resumes today in an Ankara
security court where prosecutors will continue reading their 400-page
indictment and presenting evidence to the judges. But the government now
says the six may stand for re-election in December in by-elections called to
fill their vacant seats. The six were arrested in March after the Turkish
constitutional court dissolved their DEP party and lifted their
parliamentary immunity. They are accused of membership of the outlawed PKK
Kurdish Workers party and plotting against the state. The charges carry the
death sentence.

<TEXT>
Norway's minority Labour government yesterday won parliamentary support for
plans to reduce its holdings in the country's three largest banks. Over a
three-year period the state became the controlling shareholder of the top
three banks following a far-reaching rescue operation in which it injected
NKr17bn (Pounds 1.6bn) to save them from collapse during the country's worst
banking crisis since the second world war.
The state is to cut its holdings in Den norkse Bank, the largest commercial
bank, and Christiania Bank, the second largest, first to 50 per cent and
later to 33.3 per cent. The state owns outright Fokus Bank, the third
largest commercial bank, and plans sell its entire holding.

An Albanian appeals court yesterday upheld guilty verdicts on five
ethnic-Greek minority leaders convicted of spying for Athens but reduced
their jail sentences for reasons of clemency. The move failed to appease the
Greek government, which called their original trial a political farce. The
five were arrested last April after Greek-speaking gunmen killed two
Albanian soldiers in a conscript camp near the border. Since their trial
began in August, Greece has vetoed an Ecu35m (Pounds 27.54m) loan to
Albania, effectively sealed its border and sent back about 70,000 illegal
Albanian immigrants.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German government yesterday approved DM600m (Pounds 245m) for civil
aviation research but told industry that it would have to put up the same
amount if the four-year programme is to go ahead. Mr Paul Kruger, technology
minister, said the money would be spent on developing lighter materials for
aircraft manufacture which in turn would lead to lower fuel consumption and
less pollution. The new generation of aircraft would include a 600-800
seater jumbo jet and quieter helicopters. A new generation of engines using
up to 25 per cent less fuel is also planned, Mr Kruger said.
Mr Kruger warned that the German aviation industry, which is grouped mainly
around Deutsche Aerospace, the Daimler-Benz subsidiary, was still in the
midst of massive restructuring. However, the aviation market worldwide was
expected to grow sharply towards the end of the century, he said.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Trade union raids Paris bourse
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Paris bourse yesterday fell victim to a market raid - French style.
Hundreds of trade unionists invaded the bourse headquarters in the grand
Palais Brongniart building, forcing the suspension of trading in the
financial futures pits.
The invaders, from the communist-led union, the Confederation Generale du
Travail, were protesting against the government's privatisation programme.
In particular, they demanded the cancellation of the planned sale of shares
in Renault, the state-owned automobile group and a symbol of French union
power.
'We are targeting the bourse because it is the den of capitalism,' said Mr
Joel Biard, the CGT's general secretary for the Paris area. He argued that
privatisations would destroy jobs.
The high-profile move is the latest attempt by the CGT and the Communist
Party to derail privatisation plans. Their dwindling influence, however,
means they have found little success. A call for Renault workers to down
tools last month in protest at privatisation plans mustered little support.
On Wednesday night, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, confirmed
that just over 30 per cent of Renault's shares would be floated by the end
of the year.
The CGT wielded more disruption within the bourse. Pit trading in Monep
stock options and futures contract on the CAC-40 index of leading shares
stopped. Screens were plastered with stickers, with anti-privatisation
slogans, while unionists traded places with brokers in the seats behind the
banks of terminals.
A lone broker from Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, continued to trade
by telephone, while a colleague was resigned. 'We have seen this before. Two
years ago it was a protest against job cuts at Peugeot. Before that it was
the farmers,' he said.
A spokesman for the bourse said futures trading was continuing by telephone,
and the impact of the disruption would be limited. Shares, which are traded
by an electronic system, were unaffected.
The unionists were undeterred. 'We are here to make a point. We will stay
until we have made it. That could be days.' In the event it was hours. By
2pm, the CGT had withdrawn, hoping their point had been made.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Economic Watch: Danish unemployment falls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Denmark's unemployment rate in August fell to 12.2 per cent of the workforce
compared with 12.5 per cent in July, according to figures released yesterday
by Danmarks Statistik, the Danish national statistics agency. The figure was
in line with market expectations which predicted a drop in unemployment
levels on the back of a general improvement in the economy and the
introduction of new government training schemes. Total Danish retail sales
for July and August rose 4 per cent compared with a year earlier. Industrial
production, meanwhile, was up 11 per cent in August on last year.
Unemployment in the European Union was unchanged at 10.7 per cent, or about
17.2m, in August compared with a year ago, the European Commission's
statistical office Eurostat said yesterday. Spain had the highest
unemployment rate: 21.8 per cent.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Eko Stahl workers watch with little hope: Judy Dempsey
visits an east German town on the eve of a decision about the fate of its
steelworks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Joachim Wunderlich will celebrate his 53rd birthday today. But he has
mixed feelings about the occasion. Had he been one year older, he would have
been entitled to a generous redundancy plan the Treuhand privatisation
agency is offering to those aged 54 and over and lucky enough still to be
employed at Eko Stahl, eastern Germany's largest steel mill.
The redundancy plan is dependent on the Treuhand agreeing today to selling
Eko Stahl to Cockerill-Sambre, the Belgian steel producers.
'These people will receive 80 per cent of their income until they reach the
pensionable age of 60,' said Mr Wolfgang Ramthun, head of the workers'
council at Eko Stahl. 'It is a good package. But we do not know what will
happen to the rest of the workers, whether or not Cockerill takes us over,'
he added.
The news that Cockerill intends to buy Eko Stahl has evoked little
enthusiasm among it's remaining 2,900 employees, less than a quarter of the
total workforce employed at the mill before German unification.
'We have been let down so many times in the past,' said Mr Wunderlich, who
has worked in the mill for nearly two decades. 'Many of us are sceptical
about the latest offer, especially since the European Union, and
particularly the British, will try to veto the deal, even though Brussels
helped British Steel in the past. Memories are short'.
The planned investments for Eko Stahl are likely to cost the German taxpayer
about DM1.2bn. (Pounds 490m) In an attempt to make the mill competitive, the
Treuhand will spend DM470m on building a new blast furnace. The federal
government and the state of Brandenburg, where Eko Stahl is located, will
each spend DM150m on modernising the cold-rolling mill. Cockerill will
invest DM530m in installing a hot-rolling mill, although the Belgians are
insisting that the Treuhand will subsidise a part of these investments
through providing generous credit and grant facilities.
'There is simply no alternative to these investment plans,' said Mr Ramthun.
'Without Eko Stahl, the town of Eisenhuttenstadt is dead. Withouth Eko
Stahl, there will be no chance for an industrial core to support a
Mittelstand (small and medium-sized enterprises). Without Eko Stahl, the
government will be forced to financially support the 50,000 inhabitants who
are dependent on the mill for their livelihood,' he added.
Unemployment is already officially 15 per cent of the labour force. Another
15 per cent are on government support schemes, with little prospect of
re-entering the labour market. 'The unemployed are depressed, with nothing
to do,' said Ms Birgit Pfeiffer, a nurse at the local hospital. 'Look at
them,' she said, pointing to several early-to-middle-aged men walking their
dogs. 'You are lucky if you see young people around. Over 5,000 people have
migrated to western Germany. We have lost our young, energetic generation,'
she said.
It is hardly surprising that few German politicians are prepared to let Eko
Stahl collapse, particularly since 10,400 workers have already lost their
jobs there over the past three years.
Yesterday, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the federal economics minister, visited the
mill to reassure the workers. 'He's coming just 11 days before the
election,' said Mr Wunderlich. 'Every politician is trying to gain mileage
out of Eko Stahl,' said Mr Ramthun. 'In fact, Eko Stahl is a political and
social issue,' he said.
It was ever thus. Back in 1950, east Germany's Communist party built the
giant steel complex, close to the Polish border, in order to industrialise
this under-developed and largely agricultural region of eastern Germany. The
mill - and the town which was built around it - was called Stalinstadt after
the Russian dictator. It was later changed to Eisenhuttenstadt - Iron Works
City - and was honoured as the first socialist city of the German Democratic
Republic because it had no churches.
'The communists made a terrible mistake with the mill,' said Mr Ramthun.
'They never installed a hot-rolling mill. This meant we had to send the
blocks of steel to other enterprises to be warm-rolled. They were delivered
back to us out of which we made finished products in the cold-rolling mill.
'For years the communists thought about building the hot-rolling mill. When
they finally decided to do so in the mid-1980s, they had run out of money.'
Herein lies the crux of Eko Stahl's problems. Over two-thirds of the mill's
annual DM150m losses on a yearly turnover of DM1bn are caused by high
transport costs required to get the steel hot-rolled. What the Treuhand -
and Cockerill - now want to do is to create an integrated steel mill through
building a hot-rolling division.
'That will cut losses and ensure a future for us,' said Mr Reinhard Behrend,
head of Eko Stahl's public relations department. 'Of course the west Germans
do not like this. They know we will become a real competitor. They disguise
their concern by accusing of creating over-capacity.'
'No matter what we do, it is wrong. But we have to keep hoping,' said Mr
Wunderlich. He asked that he not be given birthday greetings before today.
'It is supposed to bring bad luck.'

FT  07 OCT 94 / EU backing for telecoms competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'one-stop telecomm-unications shop' has been set up by European
governments to promote greater competition in provision of telecoms services
and help harmonise licensing arrangements.
Twenty European governments, including all EU states except Ireland, have
given their backing to the European Telecommunications Office, which has
been established in Copenhagen.
The European Commission sees the office as a key step in opening up Europe's
telecoms market to competition.
Eleven governments, including all the EU except Portugal, Greece and
Ireland, have agreed the office will provide a standardised application
procedure for companies wishing to provide new or competing telecoms
services within their countries.
Member governments will have an obligation to process applications within
six weeks where possible, and provide translations of licences into English.
Most EU states will not open basic voice telephony to competition until
1998, but a wide range of telecoms services, including private corporate
networks and leased line facilities, are already open to competition.
A Commission official said: 'This is to help make telecoms competition a
reality, by making the licensing procedure less opaque and to curb the
endless delays currently involved'.
The European Telecommunications Office has been given responsibility for
devising pan-European numbering systems for companies wishing to offer
services such as freephone in more than one country. It will look at ways of
harmonising licensing requirements, which vary widely between member states.
The Commission's telecoms division was working 'flat out' to publish a Green
Paper next month on the liberalisation of telecoms infrastructure across the
EU, enabling new operators to provide services over their own networks, the
official added.
The Green Paper is set to recommend that infrastructure be liberalised in
line with services, allowing competitors to existing telecoms operators to
begin at once with investment in competing networks. They would be able to
use them in all services by 1998.
Last week's telecoms council in Brussels saw strong opposition from Spain,
Portugal, Greece, Denmark and Ireland to any early liberalisation
infrastructure, but agreed the Commission should present proposals to the
next meeting in mid-November.
The UK, Germany, and the Netherlands have given strong support for
liberalising infrastructure in line with services.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Rover will renew assault on N America in push for sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rover-produced cars will return to the North American market despite the
sales failure of its Sterling-badged cars at the end of the 1980s, the
chairman of BMW, Rover's parent company, said yesterday.
Rovers, rather than BMWs, will also lead the German-owned group's drive into
Asian markets such as China, where explosive growth is forecast over the
coming decade, said BMW chairman Mr Berndt Pischetsrieder.
In his first wide-ranging assessment of Rover group since BMW acquired Rover
from British Aerospace for Pounds 800m in January, Mr Pischetsrieder also:
Held out the prospect of tripartite co-operation between BMW, Rover and
Honda - Rover's close associate under BAe ownership - wherever in the world
joint projects were felt to be of mutual benefit.
Made clear that BMW saw no upper limits on car production by Rover or any
reason why Rover-designed products should not be produced at assembly plants
overseas.
Confirmed that BMW is serious in its intent to revive names from the past,
such as Riley and Austin-Healey, for niche market products.
Indicated that there was virtually no chance of BMW reviving past
negotiations seeking to buy Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the Vickers-owned luxury
carmaker - 'although I have learned in this industry if you say never you
can be wrong'.
Mr Pischetsrieder set out no time scale or product plans for Rover cars to
return to North America. The group has made a success of its Land Rover
four-wheel-drive operations in North America but it has twice had to admit
defeat in the car market, withdrawing for the first time in the 1970s and
again after the Sterling debacle in 1991.
But 'it is unlikely that any manufacturer will be around in the years
2005-2010 if it is not present in all major world markets - so, yes, Rover
will be relaunched in the US', Mr Pischetsrieder said.
He gave no details of BMW's precise strategy for Asia. However, Rover, with
its smaller models and front-wheel-drive technology was an obvious choice
for such markets, he declared. BMW as a brand was too narrow and upmarket in
its model range.
He made clear that past tensions with Honda over Rover's takeover had now
disappeared. As Honda itself has sought to emphasise, its anger over the
sale of Rover - with which Honda had cross-shareholdings - was directed at
BAe for selling, not BMW for buying, the UK carmaker. Collaboration with
Honda beyond current contracts with Rover, which last up to the year 2000,
could now be contemplated.
Mr Pischetsrieder also said the Mini, now in its 36th year, may continue in
production past the end of the century if efforts to develop a replacement
were felt to have failed.

FT  07 OCT 94 / BSkyB to go public with Pounds 1bn shares sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television company, confirmed
yesterday that it plans to go public by staging a share issue on the London
and New York markets.
The issue, tentatively scheduled to take place before Christmas, is expected
to involve the sale of up to Pounds 1bn of new BSkyB shares, or 20 per cent
of its enlarged equity, valuing the company at just under Pounds 5bn.
The news of the proposed flotation marks the culmination of BSkyB's
spectacular recovery after its troubled launch period and years of losses.
It follows this summer's announcement that the company, which now has over
3.45m subscribers, increased operating profits to Pounds 176.8m in the year
to June from Pounds 54.1m in the previous year.
'We all expected BSkyB to go public at some stage,' said Mr Gerry Robinson,
chief executive of Granada, the UK leisure group which is one of the
company's four shareholders. 'It was simply a question of whether it would
be sooner or later.'
The proceeds of the issue, which will be sponsored by Goldman Sachs and
Lazard Brothers, will be used to reduce BSkyB's Pounds 1.7bn debt:
specifically to repay the Pounds 1.2bn portion of the debt given or
guaranteed by its four shareholders.
Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, will be the chief beneficiary because,
as the largest investor with 50 per cent, it provided roughly half the
Pounds 1.2bn shareholder debt. It should receive around Pounds 500m.
The other shareholders - Pearson, the media group that owns the Financial
Times, Chargeurs, the French textile company, and Granada - will benefit
largely from the eradication of their debt guarantees.
Pearson's shares yesterday rose by 8p to 590p. News Corporation's shares,
however, were unchanged at 229p, Granada's slipped by  1/2 p to 490 1/2 p
and Chargeurs' fell by FFr29 to FFr1,284.
The impetus for the flotation is understood to have come from BSkyB's
management. Chargeurs is believed to have been the only shareholder to have
been hesitant but it has struck a deal to buy more shares, avoiding dilution
of its stake.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Setback for Blair as party votes for Clause 4: Labour leader
to continue reform despite defeat on public ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair pledged yesterday to press ahead with plans to rewrite
Labour's constitution, in spite of an embarrassing defeat at the hands of
traditionalist conference delegates.
Mr Blair shrugged off leftwing demands for a halt to his modernisation drive
after delegates backed a resolution defending Clause 4, the party's
76-year-old commitment to widespread public ownership.
Dismissing the vote as 'insignificant', Mr Blair indicated that he intends
to have a statement of Labour's aims and objectives in place well before
next year's conference. But privately officials admitted the vote was a
presentational debacle.
Mr Blair has already started work on the draft of a statement which will run
to only three or four paragraphs. His intention is that it will replace
Clause 4 on every membership card.
Mr John Prescott, the deputy leader, will announce later today the details
of an extensive consultation programme with all party members. Mr Blair
believes this could be completed by the spring, paving the way for broad
agreement well ahead of the 1995 conference. He expects its ratification to
be a formality.
Friends of the leader rejected suggestions that the Clause 4 vote had in any
way altered what he terms 'a seismic shift' in Labour's political strategy
at the Blackpool conference. Mr Blair took comfort from the narrow margin of
defeat - 50.9 per cent to 49.1 per cent - and claimed that many delegates
would have voted against the motion had they not been mandated to support it
before the conference.
'It makes no difference whatever to the review taking place. It has got
absolutely no significance,' he said on BBC radio. 'I have absolutely no
doubt that the review will take place and that the result will be absolutely
positive for Labour.'
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said on the BBC's Question Time last
night: 'The Labour party will get rid of Clause 4 by this time next year.'
He described the vote as 'a bit of a setback'. Senior officials admitted in
private the defeat would damage Mr Blair's attempts to remodel the party and
make a decisive break with the past.
There was also evidence of tension between Mr Blair and senior shadow
ministers. Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, was among
those said to be irritated by the leader's handling of the issue.
Detailed voting figures showed that Mr Blair won 52.3 per cent of the trade
union vote, in spite of opposition from several big unions including the
TGWU and Unison, the public sector union.
The leadership was backed by only 41.6 per cent of constituency delegates,
but Mr Blair's friends said they believed support had grown since Tuesday's
call for rapid constitutional change.
The Conservatives were quick to exploit the confusion. Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary, said the defeat revealed the 'incompetence' of
Mr Blair's leadership.
Mr Jeremy Hanley, the Conservative party chairman, said the vote revealed
'the old Labour party, the party of unilateral nuclear disarmament, the
party of state ownership, the party that refuses to redefine socialism'.
Delegates also voted for a resolution opposed by the leadership calling for
defence spending cuts.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Surprise falls in output indicate slower UK recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Surprise falls in UK industrial production and manufacturing output in
August appeared yesterday to confirm indications that economic growth might
be slowing in the second half of 1994.
However, the Treasury pointed to special factors, such as the fire at the
Milford Haven oil refinery in July, as being mainly responsible for the
downturn in output and said the trend was still buoyant.
Financial markets welcomed news of the fall, on the grounds that it made an
imminent increase in base rates less likely. The FT-SE 100 index climbed
28.1 points to 2,984.4, while gilts rose half a point.
The Central Statistical Office said that manufacturing output fell by 0.3
per cent between July and August, while industrial production dropped 0.1
per cent. Analysts were expecting both measures to rise by 0.4 per cent.
Around two-thirds of the fall in manufacturing output was caused by a fall
in the oil refining sector. Output in this sector dropped sharply in July in
the aftermath of the Milford Haven fire, a production drop at BP's
Grangemouth refinery and maintenance at other plants. But the decline was
not confined to oil refining. The engineering industry recorded a fall in
production in August, with declines particularly noticeable in metal machine
tools and in basic electrical equipment. Other industries to record a fall
in August included textiles, leather and clothing.
Mr Nick Parsons, chief European economist at the Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce, said: 'Frankly I think the Treasury's excuse is a complete red
herring. These are not straws in the wind but building blocks for an
argument that the UK economy is slowing down.'
There have been other indications that the UK economy, which grew at its
fastest rate for six years in the second quarter, might be starting to
decelerate. In September, a survey from the Confederation of British
Industry showed a fall in the proportion of companies expecting output to
rise over the next four months, while the Purchasing Managers Index fell for
the second consecutive month.
Yesterday, figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
indicated that the pace of new car sales growth was slowing. Earlier this
week, Ford introduced short-time working at its Dagenham and Halewood
plants.
However, quarterly and annual figures for production and output indicate
that the recovery is still very healthy.
Over the past year, the strongest growth has been in North Sea oil and gas
production, which has been one of the main motors of recovery. Manufacturing
output remains below the levels reached in 1990.

Private buyers appear to be deserting the new car market in growing numbers,
although buoyant fleet business is keeping it above last year's levels,
according to figures released yesterday
Registration of new cars in September totalled 144,998, a 6.54 per cent
increase on the same month a year ago, said the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders.  But registrations to private buyers were down by
4.6 per cent.

The Italian government decided to press a formal complaint against Saverio
Borrelli, Milan's chief public prosecutor, over a newspaper interview on
Wednesday that contained damaging allegations about prime minister Silvio
Berlusconi and justice minister Alfredo Biondi. The move is a victory for
the 'hawks' in the cabinet, who argue that the government must take tough
action to curb the increasing political interference of the anti-corruption
magistrates in Milan.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Membership of teacher quango announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Teacher Training Agency, the newly formed quango, will aim to fund
institutions according to their quality, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education
secretary, said yesterday.
She named the membership of the agency, established two weeks ago to fund
teacher training both in English schools, where the government is trying to
introduce new training courses, and in universities.
They include representatives of universities, primary schools and
grant-maintained schools, and members of two other educational quangos - the
School Curriculum and Assessment Authority and the Higher Education Funding
Council for England. The agency hopes to appoint a chief executive by the
end of this month.
The move angered teachers' unions, which had fiercely contested the
legislation which created the agency.
Mrs Shephard said: 'I shall expect the agency to base the distribution of an
increasing proportion of its funding on the grounds of quality and
cost-effectiveness, while developing and maintaining a diverse system of
training.'
She added that the agency should make it a condition of making certain
grants that Ofsted, the schools inspectorate, had full access to assess
quality of provision, while it should also consider assessments by the
higher education funding and quality councils.
Mrs Shephard has the power to require the agency to take account of other
quality measures at a later date.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, was
'very fearful' of the new body. He said: 'We've always been anxious about
bodies of this kind when the government appoints the kind of people who will
do that which the government wants. For this body, it has been even more
sinister than usual in the sense that they've kept secret the personnel
until now.'
He attacked the fact that Mrs Shephard had the power to change its terms of
reference.

FT  06 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank: Low labour mobility hits Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regional unemployment levels in Russia, from 1 to 11 per cent of the
workforce, are likely to become entrenched because of low labour mobility, a
World Bank report says, David Goodhart writes. The national unemployment
rate is 5-6 per cent, as opposed to the official rate of 2 per cent, but the
duration of unemployment is found to be short. In 1993, 60-80 per cent of
those leaving unemployment did so within four months.

<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday launched a new Dollars 100m (Pounds 63.2m)
US enterprise fund to invest in small to medium-sized businesses in the
southern Africa region, reports George Graham from Washington.
Speaking on the White House lawn after a meeting with South African
President Nelson Mandela, Mr Clinton said the fund would be chaired by Mr
Andrew Young, former mayor of Atlanta and US ambassador to the UN.
Separately, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the US government
agency charged with encouraging US investment overseas, announced that it
would provide political risk insurance for two private equity funds
totalling Dollars 150m to invest in southern Africa.
Mr Mandela has been winning considerable support from US venture capitalists
on his visit to the US, but no new direct US aid package beyond the Dollars
600m the Clinton administration has already committed to South Africa.
Mr Clinton said the next phase of that package would provide loans to
guarantee Dollars 500m in new housing construction, as well as Dollars 50m
to provide electricity and Dollars 30m for basic healthcare in South
Africa's poorest areas.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Mexican MP faces arrest over murder
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican lawmaker implicated in last week's assassination of Mr Jose
Francisco Ruiz Massieu agreed yesterday to renounce his congressional
immunity, and turn himself over to the authorities.
Congress yesterday afternoon voted to grant Mr Manuel Munoz Rocha's request
for leave. A spokesman for the attorney-general's office said Mr Munoz
Rocha's whereabouts were known, and unconfirmed reports indicated that he
had been detained.
Mr Munoz Rocha said in a statement released by Congress that he had proof
that Mr Abraham Rubio Canales, a former close associate of Mr Ruiz Massieu
serving time in jail for fraud, was the 'intellectual author' of the
assassination. Mr Rubio Canales reportedly bore a grudge against Mr Ruiz
Massieu, who he believed could have kept him out of prison.
Separately, the wife of one of the alleged accomplices told investigators
that Mr Munoz Rocha had been paid about Dollars 300,000 by Mr Rubio Canales
to plan the assassination. She alleged that the conspirators' next target
had been the governor of the state of Tamaulipas whom Mr Munoz Rocha wished
to succeed.
Reports of a conspiracy to assassinate Mr Ruiz Massieu continued to rattle
investors in Mexico's financial markets. Yesterday interest rates on all but
the shortest-term government paper rose sharply in the weekly auction. The
stock market was down 1 per cent at the close, having recovered the sharp
losses of the morning.
The conspiracy theories were given further life yesterday by Mr Munoz
Rocha's claim, reported in a newspaper, that Mexico's legendary former oil
union boss, Mr Joaqun Hernandez Galicia, known as 'La Quina', was involved
in the assassination of Mr Ruiz Massieu, the number two official in Mexico's
ruling party. La Quina controlled Mexico's powerful oil union until 1989,
when his arrest was ordered by President Carlos Salinas.
In a further move last night, the attorney-general's office said that Mr
Humberto Garcia Abrego, brother of Mr Juan Garcia Abrego, suspected leader
of the Gulf drug cartel, had been detained. He was being questioned about
thee cartel's possible involvement in the murder.

FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Bayer plans generic drugs
businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bayer, the German drugs and chemicals company, is planning to set up a chain
of businesses around the world to sell unbranded, generic drugs. Generics is
one of the fastest growing segments of the pharmaceuticals business.
Bayer is creating a joint venture with US generics specialist Schein. This
is the first large deal with Schein since Bayer paid Dollars 310m for a 28.3
per cent stake in March.
Mr David Ebsworth, head of Bayer's worldwide business operations, said the
joint venture would 'be the basis of a global generics busi-ness'.
He said that the six months since the stake was taken had showed there was a
need for 'dedicated manpower' to take Schein from its US base to other
countries.
Initially, 10 to 15 people would be employed by the joint venture including
specialists in the launch and marketing of drugs and in finding new
products.
Schein already has a portfolio of more than 400 products, and is especially
strong in central nervous system and heart drugs.
Mr Ebsworth said the company would make a priority of finding new
antibiotics to manufacture and sell.

FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: American Express job cuts could
reach 6,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
American Express last night confirmed that it would undertake a wide-ranging
overhaul of the back-office operations which support its card businesses in
the US, in the process eliminating some 4,000 jobs.
The company also said it expected to cut a further 2,000 jobs by
'streamlining' other support staff throughout its worldwide operations and
at its headquarters.
Most of the cuts, out of a total workforce of 71,000, will come over the
next two years as American Express closes four operating centres in the US.
The closures would be staged to avoid disruption, the financial services
group said. Further streamlining will lead to more cuts 'over the next
several years'.
The changes mark the second round of substantial cost-cutting undertaken by
the company recently. Two years ago, American Express announced plans to axe
4,800 jobs as part of a move to reduce annual expenses by Dollars 1bn a
year. The company said that target had been reached last year.
The switch to fewer operating centres reflects a change in approach as the
financial services group broadens its range of products. At present, its
charge card, corporate card and credit card products are handled in
different centres. Plans to launch another 10-15 products in the next two
years make this fragmentation impractical, the company said.
The continued focus on improved efficiency also reflects growing competition
in the cards business. Although the market is growing strongly, card
companies have suffered from rising interest rates, which have increased
their financing costs, and the launch of a range of new credit cards.
The reorganisation - billed by American Express as a re-engineering of
processes ranging from cardmember acquisition to product development -
follows a study carried out by consultants from Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton into
the company's costs.
Each aspect of its operations was compared with those of rival card
companies in a 'benchmarking' exercise intended to highlight the most
efficient company in each area of activity. American Express said its aim
was to match the most efficient company in each area, although it had set no
overall target for savings.
The latest restructuring would be covered by a Dollars 342m charge taken in
1992, American Express said.

<TEXT>
Hoechst, the German chemicals multinational, expects 1994 net profit to be
up 'more than 20 per cent,' Mr Gunter Metz, vice-chairman in charge of
American operations, said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Mexico City.
'But that's still not enough,' he added, saying the company continued to
have problems worldwide in fibre and polymer sales.
Mr Metz was attending the 50th anniversary of Celanese Mexicana, Hoechst's
Mexican subsidiary. Hoechst has a 51 per cent participation in Celanese.
He declined to comment on speculation that the company was looking to
acquire a leading US chemical company.
Hoechst has already acknowledged 'holding discussions with several different
US companies,' but has refused to comment on rumours of a bid for Marion
Merrell Dow, a unit of Dow Chemical.
Mr Metz did say, however, that Hoechst has aggressive plans to expand its US
business. 'Our position in the North American market isn't a very big one,'
he said. 'We have a target of becoming one of the top three or five'
chemical companies there.
Hoechst shares closed in Frankfurt at DM316.50, down DM7.50.

3.4bn bid for rival

<TEXT>
Union Pacific, the biggest US railway operator west of the Mississippi, last
night signalled the start of a takeover battle by launching a Dollars 3.4bn
hostile bid for Santa Fe Pacific, one of its biggest rivals.
The surprise bid comes four months after Santa Fe had agreed to a Dollars
2.8bn friendly takeover by Burlington Northern Railroad, which would have
created the biggest railway company in the US.
Union Pacific said its bid was subject to the termination of Santa Fe's
merger agreement with Burlington and the approval of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, the federal authority that regulates railroads. In 1987, the
commission refused to permit a merger between Santa Fe and Southern Pacific.
Union Pacific said that under the proposal, Santa Fe Pacific stockholders
would receive 0.344 shares of Union Pacific stock for each Santa Fe share.
The offer is valued at Dollars 18 a share, based on the closing price of
Union Pacific stock yesterday.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Probe fuels row over Berlusconi coalition: Confrontation
with judiciary unsettles Italian stock and bond markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The future of Italy's right-wing coalition was thrown into question
yesterday with Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, at the centre of an
escalating confrontation between the government and the judiciary.
The heightening of the conflict followed an outspoken interview with Mr
Saverio Borrelli, the Milan chief public prosecutor. Mr Borrelli gave a
blunt warning that anti-corruption investigations were closing in around the
prime minister, although in a later statement he denied that a warrant was
pending for Mr Berlusconi in relation to inquiries into Telepiu, the TV
channel 10 per cent owned by the Italian premier.
In his interview Mr Borrelli also accused Mr Alfredo Biondi, the justice
minister, of mis-conduct as a defence lawyer. Mr Biondi then offered his
resignation, which was unanimously rejected at a special meeting of the
cabinet. Mr Biondi later withdrew his resignation.
Throughout a day of rapid events, political tensions mounted and prompted
scuffles outside the prime minister's office in Rome. Demonstrators who had
arrived to oppose cuts in pensions turned their attention to protests
against Mr Berlusconi's continued presence as prime minister.
Financial markets reacted nervously. The lira fell at one stage to 1,018
against the D-Mark, compared with 1,005 the previous day. Government bonds
slipped to one of their lowest quotations of the year and on the Milan
bourse the index fell 2.5 per cent.
The interview with Mr Borrelli in Corriere della Sera prompted an indignant
response from the government. Mr Giuliano Ferrara, the chief spokesman and
minister for parliamentary relations accused the judge of using 'Mafia-style
tactics' and said he planned legal action to discipline Mr Borrelli.
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro discussed the crisis with Mr Berlusconi at a
special morning meeting.
The talks with the president were themselves coloured by a row between the
head of state and Mr Berlusconi over the presentation of the 1995 budget
last Friday. President Scalfaro publicly chided the government for
submitting 400 pages of budget text for signature only 15 minutes before the
midnight deadline.
In the interview, Mr Borrelli was asked about government attacks on Milan's
anti-corruption magistrates the previous day. Mr Berlusconi had accused them
of distorting the path of justice to pursue a political vendetta against him
and his Fininvest business empire.
'There is no point hiding things,' Mr Borrelli said.
'It is true we are at a crucial turning point. What has already appeared in
the newspapers about Telepiu shows clearly we risk touching business and
politics right at the top.'
In 1990 Mr Berlusconi was obliged under anti-trust laws to divest 90 per
cent of his stake in Telepiu in 60 days. Magistrates are investigating
whether he retained secret control through friendly shareholders.

FT  06 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bank disappoints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Headline profits from Bank of Scotland were some Pounds 3m above the
market's best expectations, but there was an element of disappointment with
the 14 per cent dividend increase, which compared with some estimates that
had ranged up to 20 per cent-plus.
The dividend disappointment, plus the general slide in the stock market, saw
B of S shares underperform the FT-SE 100 Index and drop 10, or 4.8 per cent,
to 196p. The FT-SE 100 fell 1.5 per cent.
The telecoms leaders were among the market's most resilient stocks, with
NatWest Securities' 'add' recommendation for BT, based on the stock's
defensive qualities and dividend potential, helping the shares close
marginally higher on the session at 364p.
Vodafone also attracted keen support after the strong subscriber numbers for
the third quarter, which triggered widespread profits upgrades in the
market. BZW was said to have been a big supporter of the shares yesterday.
Cable and Wireless was a lone poor performer, slipping 7 to 382p in spite of
news that Bouygues Telecom, in which C&amp;W has a 20 per cent stake, has been
granted a licence to set up France's third mobile telephones network.
Strauss Turnbull, the stockbroker, issued 8m American-style call warrants on
the group and accompanied the issue with a strong recommendation on the
underlying stock, which it said was 'seriously undervalued'.
Retailing group Storehouse hardened a penny to 198p as brokers upgraded
profits expectations following an upbeat statement on current trading to
analysts and institutions.
Storehouse said sales for its first half were likely to be near 7 per cent
ahead of last year and gross margins across the group were being maintained.
BZW was among brokers that upgraded, lifting its current year forecast by
Pounds 4m to Pounds 80m, and the following year's figure by the same amount
to Pounds 96m. However, Mr Tony Shiret at the investment bank remained
cautious. He said: 'The statement was reasonably encouraging but the shares
are fairly rated given the excess capacity coming on stream over the next
few years.'
Worries over the outcome of the price war among food retailers continued to
overhang Kwik Save. The shares lost a further 7 at 539p.
There was no shortage of institutional buyers for the rump of stock not
taken up in Commercial Union's Pounds 322m rights offer. The issue was 91
per cent taken up and the remainder, some 6.4m shares, were easily placed in
the market by Cazenove, CU's joint broker along with Hoare Govett, at 490p
apiece. CU settled 3 higher at 497p.
Other insurers fell away with the market, General Accident receding 5 to
531p, Royal Insurance 9 to 275p and Sun Alliance 7 to 309p.
Merchant banks, severely mauled over the past two weeks after a series of
profit warnings, staged a tentative rally but looked vulnerable at the
close. SG Warburg finished only 3 up at 583p, while Schroders was 25 better
at 1310p and Kleinwort Benson edged forward 3 to 436p.
Securities house UBS was said to have downgraded Allied Domecq. The shares
fell 9 to 557p. Bass eased  1/2 to 515 1/2 p as talk returned that it was to
buy the Harvester chain of public houses from Forte, which closed 3 lower at
223p.
There was also speculation that Scottish &amp; Newcastle was to buy Courage from
Australian group Foster's. S&amp;N softened 2 to 479p.
Among food manufacturers, Tate &amp; Lyle tumbled 21 to 419p in trade of 1.6m as
the market reacted to Tuesday's 'reduce' advice from NatWest Securities. A
note from the broker reflected on the near-term outlook for the company
after the US government announced last week the establishment of sugar
marketing allotments.
Fresh produce group Geest bucked the poor market trend to finish 8 ahead at
202p on the news that the European Court of Justice had rejected a challenge
to the European Union's banana import regulations. The challenge initiated
by Germany could have led to stiffer competition for Geest.
British Airways dipped 2 to 354 1/2 p on 5m shares traded following a better
than expected 7.3 per cent increase for passenger traffic volume in
September.
Metals group A. Cohen jumped 30 to 540p ahead of figures due tomorrow.
Expectations of good news at today's annual meeting was unable to prevent
Ellis &amp; Everard, the chemicals distributor, shedding 3 to 258p.

Anglo-Dutch publishing group Reed Elsevier was unfortunate in the timing of
its announcement that it had made a Pounds 955m acquisition in the US and
the fall in the share price masked a mixed but generally favourable
reception.
Analysts said the company had had to pay a hefty price for the on-line legal
information service it bought from Mead Corp but the cost would be offset by
sizeable tax savings.
Ms Chris Munro of Hoare Govett argued that the group had gained access to a
market that was growing by 9 per cent a year. But one analyst commented:
'The deal poses as many strategic questions as it answers and they will need
to do a lot of work to make it all add up.' The stock closed 15 off at 740p.

FT  06 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: ICI hit by US selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A two-way pull appeared to be developing in ICI shares yesterday as word
went round the market that one US house was trying to steal a march on its
rivals and call the top of the chemicals sector.
Relatively high turnover of 4m shares and a drop of 28 to 787p yesterday was
attributed to heavy US selling, and some dealers said one house had taken
the stock off its buy list as part of a macroeconomic rerating. Morgan
Stanley was cited, although the investment bank denied any change of stance.
Shares in the UK's sector leader had reflected the boom in commodity prices
and ICI stock touched an all-time high of 868p in early August. Since then
it has fallen with the market, but many analysts have lifted profits
forecasts for the company ahead of third-quarter figures due on October 27.
Goldman Sachs, for example, believes that the stock will outperform by 10
per cent until the new year. The house chemicals team cites double-digit
growth in key commodities such as ethylene throughout September.

FT  06 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: US rate fears prompt heavy setback in
shares - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London had no choice but to follow the general setback across global stock
markets yesterday afternoon as the latest US economic data prompted fears of
a sharp rise in rates by the Federal Reserve, perhaps tomorrow when the
September payroll numbers are due.
Trading volumes were fairly modest in London, but share prices went almost
into freefall when Wall Street opened 40 Dow points off and yields on
Federal bonds moved towards 8 per cent following news that growth in US
factory orders and finished goods shipments had accelerated in August.
The FT-SE 100-share Index extended its fall by 25 points within an hour to
touch the day's low of 2,550.2. A modest rally set in as Wall Street halved
its early loss. The final reading put the FT-SE 100 at 2,956.3 for a drop on
the session of 45.5 points. The Footsie now stands at its lowest level since
early July and is barely 80 points above its low for the year.
Market confidence had been at a low ebb from the opening, as traders
digested the implications of Wall Street's heavy fall overnight. Also
discouraging was a prediction from James Capel, London's largest
institutional stockbroker, that the FT-SE 100 Index would close the year at
2,840. Many City analysts are still forecasting a Footsie year-end close in
the 3,400 to 3,600 range.
Conviction that US interest rates are about to be raised by a full
percentage point bore heavily on London because rates in the UK are
perceived to be the most vulnerable to pressures from across the Atlantic.
However, there were hopes that determined action by the Federal Reserve
might succeed in settling global bond markets down, a development regarded
as the necessary basis for any genuine recovery in equities. British
government bonds fared better than equities yesterday, giving some cause for
comfort in what was essentially a badly unnerved stock market.
With the December contract on the FT-SE 100 Index playing its usual leading
role, losses in equities were concentrated on the blue chip stocks. The
FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which takes in a broad range of Footsie and non-Footsie
shares, finished 26.1 points down at 3,429.2. Business in the non-Footsie
equities made up around 57 per cent of the day's Seaq total, once again
indicating reduced private investor interest.
The speed of the market's downturn in mid-afternoon virtually put an end to
serious business by the big investment institutions and, even after some
courageous bargain hunting towards the close, overall busines volume was not
particularly impressive. The day's Seaq total of 515.8m shares compared with
531.6m on Tuesday, when retail, or customer, business, worth Pounds 1.01bn,
remained around acceptable levels from the view point of market
profitability.
No sector of the market escaped from the overall setback. The US-influenced
blue chips suffered for their association with Wall Street, although
turnover in these stocks did not suggest significant selling pressure. Reed
Elsevier was a weak spot after debt ratings were questioned in the wake of a
Pounds 955m deal in the US.
Interest rate-related stocks, including the leading store groups, turned
easier but losses were fairly small in spite of fears that domestic base
rates could soon be under upward pressure if rates rise in the US. There
were further losses in the financials sector, where the woes of the UK stock
and bond markets have already hit profits at the merchant banks, which are
heavy players in these arenas and also hold portfolios which were being
devalued rapidly yesterday afternoon.
Traders said that the London market had clearly lost all confidence ahead of
Friday's announcement of the US payroll data.

FT  06 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures fell steeply in heavy volume, applying clear downward
pressure to the cash market throughout the day, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract pushed down to 2,955 at one stage but
managed to climb back to 2,974 at the official 4:10 close, a decline on the
day of 45 points.
At this level the premium to the cash market was 17.7 points, with the fair
value premium standing at 15 points.
December trading volume rose sharply to 16,598 lots, from 10,383 in the
previous session.
There was genuine selling pressure from the outset but the real downwards
drive came once Wall Street had opened at 2:30pm London time.
From then on the premium to cash equities narrowed dramatically, squeezing
down at times to within two points. Traders said US selling had been
substantial.
Equally, there was obvious support at 2,955, in spite of the complete
absence of institutional business. The tone on Wall Street is providing the
main lead at the moment.
Turnover in traded options also moved up sharply, rising to 46,199 lots,
almost double the previous day's total. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume
accounted for more than 31,000 contracts.
National Westminster was the most actively traded stock option with 1,331
lots dealt.

FT  06 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow closes well above the
day's low point
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
The jittery US stock markets retreated again yesterday, although the leading
indices finished well off the session's lows, writes Frank McGurty in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed just 13.79 lower at 3,787.34, a
marked improvement from the early afternoon when the index was down by as
much as 53 points. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was finally off 1.07 at 453.52.
But the partial comeback obscured the extent of a downturn set off by fresh
data suggesting that the economy was growing at an unmanageable pace.
Declining issues on the Big Board swamped advances by 1,751 to 538 after
heavy volume of 360.3m shares.
The losses were not restricted to the New York SE. The Nasdaq composite was
down 1.02 at 746.28, while the American SE composite was set back 2.70 to
451.11.
The broad sell-off was triggered by the latest in the series of unfavourable
surprises which appeared to bring forward the next move by the Federal
Reserve to tighten monetary policy.
The Commerce Department said orders of factory goods had jumped 4.4 per
cent, confounding analysts who had predicted a 3.5 per cent increase after
July's 2.0 per cent decline.
Bonds plunged on the news, as fixed-rate investors acted upon their
anxieties over the unsettling outlook on inflation. Late in the day the
yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond was just below 8.00 per cent,
an important psychological barrier.
The prospect of another move to curb growth depressed many stocks whose
fortunes are closely linked to the economic cycle.
Alcoa, the aluminium supplier, slipped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 82 3/4 and
Caterpillar, the heavy equipment manufacturer, gave back Dollars 7/8 at
Dollars 53 1/4 . Deere ran counter to the trend, moving forward Dollars 1 to
Dollars 67 7/8 .
Elsewhere, takeover speculation continued to buffet some individual stocks.
On the Nasdaq, Apple surged Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 37 7/8 as talk
circulated among investors that Motorola would launch a bid for the computer
company. Motorola receded Dollars 1 to Dollars 50.
Marion Merrell Dow relinquished Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 25 3/8 a day after
its shares appreciated 10 per cent. Hoechst, the German group, is said to be
considering a move to acquire the drugs company. Dow Chemical, which owns 72
per cent of MMD, retreated Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 73 1/8 .
The completion of a deal in the health care field was given a mixed
reception by investors. Columbia HCA was marked down Dollars 2 1/8 to
Dollars 40 5/8 after agreeing to acquire HealthTrust, a Nashville-based
hospital group, for Dollars 3.68bn in newly issued stock. HealthTrust
strengthened Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 34 1/4 on the news.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Still depressed by political uncertainty and influenced by the Wall Street
gyrations, Mexican share prices staged a further early slide before
recov-ering some ground. Bargain hunting prevailed later in the day in a
market that has seen seven losses in the last eight sessions.
The IPC index, 2.9 per cent lower at one stage, closed 28.63 or 1.07 per
cent off at 2,641.39.

Sell orders and rising bond yields sent the Toronto market tumbling
yesterday morning, but the afternoon rally on Wall Street helped the TSE
retrieve some of the early loss in a day of heavy trading.
At its worst the TSE 300 index was down 58 points, but ended a net 20.9 off
at 4,253.36. Declines outscored rises by 209 to 480 after volume of 67.1m
shares valued at CDollars 1.07bn.

FT  06 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo picks up as Hong
Kong falls 2.2%
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Buying by public funds and arbitrageurs lifted prices during the afternoon
session and the Nikkei 225 average gained 0.9 per cent, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The index ended 182.94 higher at 19,751.55. Investors were initially
discouraged by Tuesday's sharp decline on Wall Street and the market saw a
low of 19,487.70 briefly after the opening. However, a rise in futures
prompted active arbitrage buying, while a rebound in Japan Telecom provided
further support, and the Nikkei rose to a high of 19,752.55 just before the
close.
Volume remained below 200m shares for the third consecutive session, at 197m
against 161m. Traders now expect most investors to remain absent ahead of
the October 27 listing of Japan Tobacco.
The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 9.26 at 1,582.05, while
the Nikkei 300 put on 2.39 at 289.89. In spite of the rise in the indices,
losers led gainers by 491 to 478, with 212 issues unchanged. In London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index was up 0.72 at 1,300.27.
Japan Telecom was ahead Y340,000 at Y4.14m after hitting a record low of
Y3.73m in the morning. Some dealers had feared initially that investors
looking to purchase Japan Tobacco stock would sell high-priced former
state-owned companies' shares to raise funds. But NTT recovered Y15,000 to
Y877,000 after a three-day fall, and East Japan Railway improved Y8,000 to
Y483,000.
Nippon Shinpan, a consumer credit company sold on Tuesday on fears of
financial problems at its subsidiaries, rebounded Y27 to Y785. The company
denied rumours that its finance affiliates were suffering from mounting bad
loans.
Paper and pulp issues were stronger on hopes of improving demand. Honshu
Paper rose Y32 to Y650 and New Oji Paper added Y20 at Y1,020.
High-technology stocks were mixed. Sony declined Y30 to Y5,770, but NEC rose
Y30 to Y1,220 and Matsushita Electric Industrial firmed Y10 to Y1,580.
In Osaka, the OSE average put on 6.30 at 21,969.28 in volume of 9.6m shares.
Buying by public funds supported the index.
Roundup
There was a conventional response in the region to Wall Street's overnight
losses, but several markets moved higher.
HONG KONG was rocked by the US sell-off, the Hang Seng index losing 205.76
or 2.2 per cent at 9,298.36 as October Hang Seng futures broke down in the
last 15 minutes of trading. Turnover expanded from HKDollars 3.19bn to
HKDollars 3.60bn.
Property shares again led the market down, with Henderson Land dropping
HKDollars 1.90 to HKDollars 46.40 ahead of its results. Sun Hung Kai fell
HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 55.50 and Hysan Development HKDollars 1.25 to
HKDollars 20.20.
The mainland Chinese companies' H-share index fell 41.45 or 3 per cent to
1,326.07. However, SHANGHAI's A share index shed 11.1 per cent on plans to
ban same-day settlement, closing 90.11 off at 723.37.
SYDNEY blamed programme selling as the All Ordinaries index dipped 18.3 to
1,979.8. Turnover increased from ADollars 364.7m to ADollars 439m.
News Corp recovered 4 cents to ADollars 8.10, dealers saying the media group
had been oversold since announcing, last Friday, its intention to issue
limited voting preference shares.
SEOUL lost ground after three days of rises, the composite index closing
7.35 down at 1,057.24. The Finance Ministry announcement that it would raise
the limit for foreign shareholdings on the market to 12 per cent from the
current 10 per cent by December 1 failed to boost prices.
WELLINGTON's NZSE 40 index shed 1 per cent for the second consecutive day,
ending 22.49 lower at 2,035.01. Turnover picked up through the session and
finished at NZDollars 42m.
MANILA drew comfort from lower domestic inflation figures which helped the
market to overcome a soft start. The composite index gained 19.7 at
2,973.31, but volume fell to 1.9bn shares from 3.2bn.
Megaworld Properties and Holdings led gainers, closing 8 per cent up at
13.50 pesos on news of its link with another group to develop a 215-hectare
property in Cavite.
KUALA LUMPUR rebounded on institutional bargain hunting and the composite
index rose 8.06 to 1,133.72. KLI Holdings led activity, adding 40 cents at
MDollars 6.00 on new projects totalling MDollars 4.8bn.
KARACHI ended higher on demand for synthetics and selective blue chips on
expectations of good annual results and increased dividends.
The KSE 100-share index closed 13.91 higher at 2,324.67.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index, up 10.27 at 2,380.83, rose for
the sixth consecutive session after a late revival of interest in property
shares. In the property sector, CDL rallied 20 cents to SDollars 8.35 and
DBS 4 cents to SDollars 4.94.
JAKARTA firmed as local investors, net sellers in the run-up to Tuesday's
launch of Indosat, the telecoms group, returned to the secondary market. The
market index picked up 2.91 to 503.64.

FT  06 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses suffer again from
domino effect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The domino effect wreaked more havoc yesterday, as higher than expected US
factory orders hit Treasuries, the Dow, European bond markets and equities,
writes Our Markets Staff.
Equity valuations were not sufficiently cheap in Europe to make up for lack
of impetus from America, said Mr Andrew Bell, director of European strategy
at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. 'On the way up,' he said, 'interest rate-driven
markets took prices to the point where we were looking at 1996 earnings at
the end of 1993.'
If bond yields rose further, he added, equities in Europe might have to
become visibly undervalued to bring in the buyers. Mr Bell was not, however,
looking for any repeat of October 1987. 'There is more risk of a 5 per cent
crumble than a 30 per cent crash,' he maintained.
FRANKFURT's Dax index fell 26.23 to a new 1994 closing low of 1,968.72 on
the session. After an intraday low of 1,930.55, it lost 42.8 or 2.1 per cent
to 1,946.49 in the post bourse. Turnover rose from DM6bn to DM7.5bn.
Dealers reported domestic and US selling and Mr Glen Liddy at Kleinwort
Benson said that stocks which had been favoured to a degree in recent weeks
were punished yesterday. In chemicals, Bayer and Hoechst fell DM11 to DM331
and DM13.10 to DM309.50; in utilities, RWE by DM16.50 to DM425.50, and Veba
by DM22.50 to DM487.
Among second liners, Asko dropped a further DM45 to DM730 on the session
following Tuesday's loss of DM85 on a DB Research downgrade.
PARIS, too, established a new 1994 low as the CAC 40 index declined 42.40 or
2.3 per cent to 1,833.72 in turnover of FFr3.7bn. Financials were weak, with
Credit Local down FFr17.30 at FFr377.50, and Suez by FFr10 at FFr240.
Bouygues, the sole riser for much of the day, ended FFr9 higher at FFr587.
One of the construction company's consortiums was awarded the potentially
lucrative licence to run France's third mobile telephone system; and another
got the contract for the St Denis stadium in north Paris which will be the
main venue for the 1998 soccer World Cup.
Bouygues beat groups led by Alcatel Alsthom, which fell another FFr19.40 to
FFr461.60, and Lyonnaise des Eaux, which dropped FFr14 to FFr475; Lyonnaise,
at least, had the consolation of forming part of the winning sports stadium
consortium.
AMSTERDAM fell 2.1 per cent and Elsevier came under pressure on ratings
warnings after its takeover of Mead Data Central for Dollars 1.5bn.
The AEX index dropped 8.36 to 390.13. Elsevier fell 60 cents to Fl 16.10
following its 10-for-one share split, after Standard &amp; Poor's placed Reed
Elsevier ratings on CreditWatch negative and Moody's put its long-term debt
ratings on review for a possible downgrade.
A Fl 5.90 fall to Fl 178.60 in VNU was attributed to worries that its
television affiliate RTL may lose star performers.
Chemicals and internationals were under pressure, with Akzo Nobel down Fl
4.80 at Fl 197.30, DSM Fl 4.30 lower at Fl 139.60 and Royal Dutch Petroleum
falling Fl 3.80 to Fl 185.
MILAN saw one of its worst fears come true as the government unexpectly
found itself pitched into renewed battle with the country's anti-corruption
magistrates.
The Comit index fell 16.04 or 2.4 per cent to 641.94, on a day which saw
allegations that the prime minister could become involved in a formal graft
investigation, the justice minister offer his resignation and a government
spokesman call for a criminal suit against the country's chief prosecutor.
Among the blue chip stocks, Fiat fell L126 or 1.9 per cent to L6,351 and
Stet lost L214 or 4.5 per cent at L4,492. A further L1,037 or 5.1 per cent
fall to L19,257 in Benetton was attributed to renewed rumours that the
company might launch a capital increase.
ZURICH's interest rate worries came to the fore and the SMI index dropped
41.1 or 1.7 per cent to 2,480.4.
Attention continued to focus on UBS following last Friday's share
restructuring announcement. The bearers fell another SFr10 to SFr1,181 and
the registered shares were SFr2 lower at SFr285.
The weaker dollar weighed on industrials, leaving Brown Boveri and Sulzer
down SFr28 at SFr1,062 and SFr13 at SFr802 respectively.
Profit-taking eroded some of Swiss Re's recent sharp gains on the sale of
its direct investment activities, the shares falling SFr6 to SFr665.
Drug stocks followed the lower trend, with Ciba declining SFr12 to SFr718
and Roche certificates giving up SFr105 to SFr5,620.
MADRID ended off its worst, with the general index down 5.65 or 1.9 per cent
at a new closing low of 290.07, after 286.97, in turnover of Pta35.8bn.
Rough treatment was meted out to selected banks, utilities and construction
stocks.

FT  06 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan shares plunged 3.3 per cent yesterday after reports that a securities
brokerage controlled by a leading stock market player, Mr Oung Da-ming, had
bounced a TDollars 200m cheque, writes Laura Tyson.
Panic selling set in as investors feared a chain reaction in the market,
fuelled by a likely tightening of credit terms by underground financiers.
Stock market speculators often finance their share purchases through margin
loans from informal lenders.
An official from the brokerage, Hong Fu Securities, confirmed the report but
said that the problem would be resolved shortly.
Mr Oung is the de facto head of the Hualon Group, one of Taiwan's 10 biggest
industrial conglomerates, and a member of the country's Legislative Yuan, or
parliament.
The benchmark weighted index, which hit a four-year high of 7,183.75 on
Mon-day, closed 235.33 down at 6,944.59. Shares in Hualon, the group's
flagship textile manufacturer, and Chia Hsin Livestock, a company controlled
by the group, dropped by the daily limit of 7 per cent.

FT  06 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Bullion worries pressure South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg was under pressure from the sharp losses on Wall Street and
gold price weakness, leaving the overall index 38 lower at 5,616.
Industrials declined 31 to 6,270 and golds receded 34 to 2,366.
Spot prices were less sensitive to the negative sentiment than futures,
however, where near term index futures posted steep falls amid concern that
gold's expected break above Dollars 400 an ounce would not materialise.
South Africa's split country ratings from S&amp;P and Moody's did little to spur
investment, although analysts expected that the country's forthcoming
inclusion in emerging market indices could prompt renewed interest.
De Beers slipped R1 to R101 and Anglos fell R1.50 to R236.50. Minorco lost
R1 at R110. Barlows retraced some of its recent steady gains, giving up R1
to R30. SAB eased 50 cents to R83.50 and Sasol was off 25 cents at R35.75.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Political worries hit lira
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed tensions in Italy between the government and magistrates
investigating corruption prompted a sharp fall in the lira yesterday, writes
Philip Gawith.
Fears that investigations were reaching ever higher into government,
possibly to the point where Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi might be
implicated, saw the lira fall to a London close of L1,016 per D-Mark from
L1,008.
The dollar was again weaker. Stronger than expected factory order figures
caused bond prices to fall, and the dollar fell in tandem. It finished in
London at DM1.5426 and Y99.47, from DM1.5519 and Y99.69 respectively. In New
York it closed at DM1.5445 and Y99.605.
The Russian rouble continued its recent fall, closing in Moscow at Rbs2,808
to the dollar from Rbs2,668. The Russian currency started the year around
Rbs1,250 to the dollar.
Sterling was firmer on the day, with the trade weighted index ending at 80.2
from 80.
With renewed political instability in Italy, some observers believe the lira
will test the low for the year of L1,030.50 against the D-Mark.
Mr Stephen Yorke, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank in London, commented: 'I
think the government is encircled. The magistrates seem on the verge of
implicating very senior members of government. If that were to happen, the
lira would, at the very least, retest the lows for the year.
'If it looks like Mr Berlusconi will be investigated (by the magistrates),
then I think we will be in for freefall.'
Elsewhere in Europe, the Swiss franc and D-Mark were both generally firmer
as the weakness in the lira spread to the French franc and other currencies.
The franc finished at FFr3.418, from FFr3.415, against the D-Mark.
The catalyst for the rouble's recent weakness was the central bank's
decision, on September 22, to stop intervening to support the currency. Over
the two to three months prior to this, according to Mr Sergei Alexashenko,
the deputy finance minister, the central bank had spent more than Dollars
2bn defending the rouble.
The main reason for the currency's weakness would appear to be the high rate
of inflation. Consumer price inflation in the year to August was 267.9 per
cent. However, some bankers argue that the rouble's recent fall merely
reflects the central bank trying to drive the rate lower, in order that it
can sell hard currency to help pay the government's debts.
Mr Jonathan Hoffman, international economist at CS First Boston in London,
said the rouble, after a period of relative stability, was merely catching
up for recent inflation losses. He added, however, that in spite of recent
weakness, the rouble's real value was probably about 10 per cent higher than
at the start of the year.
The weakness of the dollar came against the backdrop of market fears that
the Federal Reserve was not being sufficiently aggressive in combatting
inflation. This view was encouraged by the higher than expected factory
orders figures.
Comments in Jeddah from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, that
the fundamentals supporting the dollar were the best in 20 years, and that
the US did not use the dollar as a trade tool, were ignored by the market.
Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG War-burg, argued that even a
50 basis-point rise in US rates 'would constitute firefighting . . . and at
best could be expected to hold the dollar in its current range for a while
longer'.
He went on to say: 'A significant dollar recovery will only be seen once
confidence in the Federal Reserve has returned, sufficient to spark an
inflow of long-term capital into US asset markets.
'The inability of either equity or bond markets to make headway during 1994
does not provide us with much confidence on this score, and the combination
of higher inflation, higher rates and slower growth in the next few months
hardly seems the recipe for a change in trend over the winter.'
Taking a slightly different view was Mr David Munro, chief US economist at
High Frequency Economics in New York. He said the special feature of the
current US economic recovery is ongoing restructuring, and competitive
resistance to higher finished goods prices.
'This is why a merely fractional acceleration of inflation is due. That will
give the Fed a rationale to moderate its boost to short rates,' added Mr
Munro.
In the weekly repo tender, the Bundesbank allocated DM74.2bn in 14-day
securities repurchase agreements at a fixed interest rate of 4.85 per cent -
the 11th consecutive pact at this level. This constituted a net addition of
DM4.9bn to the market. Call money rates eased slightly to 4.85/4.95 per
cent.
In the UK, the Bank of England provided Pounds 385m assistance to UK money
markets, compared with a shortage of Pounds 600m. Overnight money traded
between 5 1/8 and 7 per cent. The Bank also said it would today provide
Pounds 1.359bn to the market by way of repo and secured loan facilities.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pipeline project to push
Algeria up European gas league - Work on a 1,845km supply link to the
Iberian peninsular has begun on time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The building of the Maghreb Europe Pipeline (GME) has started on time.
In spite of the violence that affects much of Algeria and the uncertainty
surrounding the country's political future, work has started on the three
main sections of the GME, which by mid-1996 will deliver Algerian gas to
Morocco, Spain and Portugal.
The 1,845km pipeline is being built in three main sections. The 530km
Algeria section is being laid by Bechtel, a US company. The delivery of
several hundred kilometres of pipes and pipe-laying activity are due to
start later this autumn.
The 540km Moroccan section, which is being laid by EMPL, a subsidiary of the
leading Spanish gas utility, Enagas, has had over half its materials
delivered and construction is to commence before Christmas.
Italy's Saipem has begun work on the submarine section and is due to
complete the work by the middle of next year. Saipem was responsible for
laying, between 1980 and 1983, the TransMed pipeline, which runs between
Tunisia and Italy, the deepest submarine pipeline in the world.
The overall cost of the project is estimated at Dollars 2.8bn and it is
backed by major western export credit organisations such as the US Eximbank,
Germany's Hermes, France's Coface and the European Investment Bank.
When completed in mid-1996, the GME will add some 7.2bn cubic metres to the
annual pipeline export capacity of Sonatrach, Algeria's state oil and gas
company, taking it to 31.2bcm.
This will be quickly expanded. Annual sales of 8.5bcm will be made to Spain
and Portugal. Morocco is also a customer and will take its gas as a transit
fee, as Tunisia has been doing for the past 11 years with gas passing
through the TransMed pipeline.
Algeria has already contracted to sell a total of 32.5bcm of gas annually,
by the year 2000, to customers through the TransMed and GME lines.
Sonatrach's current liquefied natural gas commitments are for 25.1bcm. For
the first time in Algeria's history, sales of piped exports are set to
overtake exports of LNG.
Ironically, the build up of the Spanish market to take the projected
pipeline volume will probably require use of Algeria's refurbished LNG
plants, but only for a short period.
Algeria's LNG export capacity will reach a peak of about 30bcm just as the
GME takes away the bulk of its Spanish market. By the time the GME volumes
to Spain reach their contractual plateau in the year 2000, Algeria will face
its first LNG competition in the Spanish market as Enagas begins to take
delivery of Nigerian supplies in 1999. The steady expansion expected in the
Spanish market will continue to require the same level of Algerian LNG
exports but Algeria will have to look elsewhere for extra sales.
Sonatrach has, to date, restricted itself to 60bcm of exports. This means
that any increase above this level, using the capacity that will clearly be
there, must come from gas discoveries by Sonatrach's new international oil
company partners.
British Petroleum is close to an agreement to develop large reserves in the
hitherto unexploited south-west of the country. If finalised, the Dollars
2.5bn project to develop fields around In Salah will involve BP constructing
over 500km of pipeline and marketing the gas in Europe in partnership with
Sonatrach. Other companies, notably Agip of Italy, are confident that they
will quickly follow once the pattern is set by the first deal.
But the 'GME's biggest achievement', according to Mr James Ball, director of
the Gas Matters consultancy, is '. . . not so much the co-operation it has
brought about between countries on the northern and southern shores of the
Mediterranean, but the co-operation it has brought between Spain and
Portugal'.
Indeed as recently as 1989, Portugal considered gas transit across Spain
politically unacceptable. But by 2000 Portugal will be importing 2.5bcm of
piped gas through the GME, a little over one-quarter of the total
throughput.
Spanish demand, meanwhile, is projected to rise to 12bcm a year by the turn
of the century, a 71 per cent increase from the present consumption level,
the largest demand coming from power generation and industrial
co-generation.
Despite this massive increase in Spanish offtake of Algerian gas, Italy will
remain by far Sonatrach's most important customer.
Italy's power generator, Enel, is scheduled to begin taking delivery of its
4bcm annual contract in 1996, augmenting the 19.5bcm the gas utility SNAM
already takes through the TransMed pipeline. In addition, SNAM recently
concluded a long-term purchase agreement for 1.8bcm of Algerian LNG, its
first ever such contract from Algeria, which will be delivered to the
recently refurbished Panagaglia terminal at La Spezia.
In August, Sonatrach delivered the first cargo of Algerian gas to the
world's newest LNG customer nation, Turkey.
Algeria has become the dominant supplier of gas to those countries in
southern Europe where its use is growing fastest. Today, Algeria's share of
the European gas market ranks third, with 19 per cent of the total, after
the CIS with 36 per cent and the Netherlands with 26 per cent. As Dutch
production declines from the turn of the century, Algeria could well become
Europe's second largest outside supplier of gas.

<TEXT>
A burst of speculative buying and short-covering that lifted all London
Metal Exchange contracts at midday yesterday vanished in the afternoon and
prices drifted back.
COPPER'S renewed strength, which saw the three months price top Dollars
2,530 a tonne at one stage, helped ALUMINIUM reach its medium term target of
Dollars 1,650 a tonne before being hit by the inevitable bout of
profit-taking. This saw last business at Dollars 1,640, unchanged from
Tuesday.
Investment funds were reported to be active again in the ZINC market, still
considered a laggard compared with the impressive rises seen in some other
metals this year. At the close of the afternoon ring three months zinc stood
at Dollars 1,063.50 a tonne, up Dollars 6 on the day and Dollars 34 on the
week so far.
London COCOA futures plunged late in the day following the New York market,
which fell to a new 5-month low at midday.
The GOLD market returned to its bullish track after fund buying emerged in
New York. The London price found support at Dollars 392 a troy ounce and
closed at Dollars 392.70, up 30 cents. 'There is feeling that the recent
sell-off. . . was really just consolidation and profit-taking,' one trader
said.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: S Africa opens doors to foreign
explorers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa yesterday threw open its offshore acreage for international oil
and gas exploration.
In a move aimed at bringing the country back into the mainstream of the
world energy markets, Pretoria solicited bids for licences to explore
virtually all the country's coastal areas, divided into 18 blocks.
Mr Pik Botha, the former foreign minister, who is now minister of mines and
energy, told a launch seminar attended by oil and gas companies in London
that his government 'sees this licensing round as a major step forward in
exploring our offshore potential.
'We cannot guarantee that you will discover gas or oil or both,' he said.
'But we are setting in motion an intensive - and extensive - process of
exploration never undertaken before'.
Bids for licences have to be submitted by April next year, and Mr Botha said
he hoped to have the allocation process complete by November 1995.
Exploration programmes will have to be for a minimum of three years and a
maximum of seven.
International oil companies were active in South Africa until the early
1970s when most of them withdrew for political reasons. Since then, there
has only been a small amount of exploration, mainly by Soekor, the state oil
company.
South Africa produces a third of its liquid hydrocarbons artificially from
coal, and imports certain amounts of oil, mainly from Iran.
Mr Botha said yesterday that the tariff protection given to the local oil
and gas industry would continue because of its important contribution in
saving foreign exchange. But he said South Africa was keen to widen its
trade relations with energy-producing nations, and deals were pending with
various OPEC countries which he declined to name.
So far, 19 companies - 17 of them from abroad - had asked for information
packs about the blocks on offer.
Mr Botha said he was 'very encouraged' by the attendance at yesterday's
seminar, which included many of the world's major oil companies.
Asked whether South Africa was more secure than other new energy markets
that are opening up, such as Central Asia, Mr Botha said: 'As secure, if not

technology and infrastructure.
'I can assure you,' he added, 'that the rules are not only reasonable but

Zambia's mines minister Paul Kapinga said yesterday that the government
would bring forward the proposed privatisation of Zambia Consolidated Copper
Mines, reports Reuters from Lusaka. He said this would end speculation on
whether the major mining company would be sold or not.
'We are bringing forward the sale of ZCCM from the last tranche to other
earlier tranches so that it could be sold much earlier than previously
arranged,' the minister told reporters. But he did not say how soon.
According to the Zambia Privatisation Agency, no timetable had yet been set
under the tranche sales programme for the privatisation of ZCCM, which is
60.3 per cent government owned, and several other strategic enterprises.
Mr Kapinga said the government favoured privatising ZCCM as a single entity
rather than unbundling it into five separate ones as recommended by foreign
consultants.
Deputy mines minister Mr Mathias Mphande said last month he favoured
unbundling because potential shareholders could find it difficult to raise
the estimated USDollars 3bn needed for rehabilitation and new projects in
the next three years.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: European Court rejects German
banana complaint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice yesterday rejected a complaint about the
European Union's banana import regime after Germany claimed the rules
discriminated against its traditional Latin American suppliers.
Germany, which is the largest EU importer of bananas, complained to the
court about the privileged access to the market enjoyed by former French and
British colonies in so-called ACP - Africa, Caribbean and Pacific -
countries. It claimed this discriminated against cheaper imports from Latin
American suppliers.
The court said Germany's reasoning was not sufficient 'to justify nullifying
the market regime'. It followed advice from the advocate-general given in
June last year.
New rules imposed by the European Commission last year restrict Latin
American banana shipments to a tariff-free quota of 2.1m tonnes a year. A
deal with Latin American countries was brokered by the commission after they
complained to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade about ACP countries
enjoying favourable access to the EU market.
Germany has already filed an additional court case about that deal with
Latin American countries, claiming the commission had no authority to
negotiate it. The court is expected to hear the case in about a year.
Meanwhile, the commission's management committee, which supervises the
banana regime, put off a decision yesterday about aid for the Windward
Islands, where banana crops have been devastated by tropical storms.
Geest, the food company, has called on the commission to allow it to import
bananas from other sources under the ACP quota allocated to the Windward
Islands to ensure that the island group does not lose market share
permanently. The commission said it was still gathering information and
could reach a decision in the next couple of weeks.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Accountancy Column: An institutional fracture in need of
repair - The importance of solving the debate on how to reshape the six
professional bodies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The accountancy profession is currently suffering from an acute attack of
institutional gridlock. Asked to forge a new structure to meet the
challenges of the next century, the six main professional bodies have been
reduced, in the words of one leading player, to 'flicking paperclips at each
other'.
In theory, the reshaping of the profession should be taking place in an
office on Salisbury Square, off Fleet Street. Here leading representatives
of the bodies meet to discuss reform under the chairmanship of David Bishop,
a partner at the accountants KPMG Peat Marwick specialising, helpfully, in
change management.
Gathered around a single table are the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales (ICAEW), the Institute of Chartered Accountants of
Scotland, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, the Chartered
Association of Certified Accountants (ACCA), the Chartered Institute of
Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa), and the Chartered Institute of
Management Accountants (Cima).
The bodies have already produced the so-called Bishop Plan which envisaged a
merger to form three geographical blocks - England, Scotland and Ireland.
They agreed that their combined membership of 200,000 should be consulted on
the plan.
At least that is what they thought they had agreed. The powerful ICAEW is
accused of not consulting at all but promoting the merger plan, which its
rivals see as a vehicle for it to swallow up the rest, or at least its
biggest rival, the ACCA. Partly motivated by this perceived injustice, ACCA
promptly produced its own plan - dubbed Bishop 2. This shelved
rationalisation in favour of harmonisation under a new umbrella body
constructed along the lines of the General Medical Council - and named the
General Accounting Council.
The ICAEW was stung to respond in language not normally associated with
accountants. The idea was, according to the its mild-mannered president
Roger Lawson, not only 'dead on arrival' but 'still-born'.
A president of one of the bodies received notification of this plan several
days after it appeared in the press. Others heard of it for the first time
over the table at Salisbury Square. One can only imagine the discomfort felt
by David Bishop in such circumstances.
Yet again the accountancy profession appears to be heading for fracture when
consolidation was in sight. The last successful merger was in 1957. The last
time they failed, in 1970, the result was the Consultative Committee of
Accountancy Bodies. Born of failure it is seen by many as having failed the
profession at a vital time.
During a decade marked by corporate collapses such as the fall of the
Maxwell empire, Polly Peck and BCCI, many in the profession, and plenty in
government, have looked to the professional bodies for public
accountability. This highlights the problem facing the bickering six: there
are strong forces at work which require the profession to do something
before something is done to it. Another corporate collapse could convince
the present government to put the accountancy profession on its agenda. A
Labour government might find the time any way. If neither acts the European
Parliament may.
The need to provide public accountability, regulation and standards is
recognised. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, joined
the argument by telling the profession earlier this year to merge in order
to improve its ability to lobby government. Accountants, he said, should
speak with one voice.
The problem is that the six cannot bring themselves to talk sensibly to each
other. The cloud of competition has to some extent obscured the need to
provide a service to customers. The ICAEW is, for one, aware that
prevarication could cost the profession dear.
ACCA is emerging as a dynamic body. Its chief executive Anthea Rose is a
forceful personality who appears to have a firm grip on her organisation. It
has 100,000 students (about half of them outside the UK) compared with the
institute's 11,000. Outside the UK, ACCA's qualifications and ideas are
spreading fast.
The body wants this potential power to be realised while the ICAEW's
strengths, founded on its prestigious chartered brand and more than 100,000
members, stand in its way. It is understandably furious about the Bishop 2
plan. However, ACCA is terrified of being swallowed whole by the ICAEW. It
wants to protect its 'core values' of open access to the profession,
flexible education and a common 'title' for accountants. ACCA suspects the
institute is pushing its members to share their coveted title now, in a
merger they can dominate, rather than later in a merger with stronger
partners.
The other bodies watch this clash of power with increasing alarm. In Ireland
things are simplest in the most complicated of settings. Throughout the
violence the institute has met in both Belfast and Dublin, and is committed
to an all-Ireland body. It would preserve this arrangement under Bishop and
has therefore given it a cautious welcome.
Cima is for rationalisation and welcomed the publication of Bishop. It wants
recognition of the value of its international activities and of the status
of management accountancy as an equal partner with other disciplines.
Cipfa has strong sympathies with Bishop 2. It feels that the original plan
was rushed through and as a result was ill-conceived with little regard for
detail. A papering over of the cracks which inevitably fell apart. It would
probably support a limited Bishop 2 scheme for an umbrella body and some
harmonisation between the bodies operating under its governance.
The Scots find themselves in a no lose situation. Their treasured
independence and compact organisation are rigorously defended. Their
position is less anxious and summed up as: 'Its best to remain good friends
rather than be unhappily married.'
Most of the bodies believe that the worst scenario is approaching. That the
position ante Bishop will be the same as before.
To avoid such an outcome some creative thinking is going on about a possible
structure for debate in 1995. The idea of the General Accounting Council
might survive in some form - perhaps even as a 'limited umbrella' covering
some of the bodies. There is a strong sense that the GAC was a credible idea
launched with disastrous consequences for merger. Cynics believe its launch
was designed to be just that.
Meanwhile a process of ad hoc harmonisation may well begin to spring up.
This could be limited to targeting areas for joint action or simply to
cutting costs by amalgamation of services. It might also stimulate a debate
about whether the profession is one profession, or several. If the second,
what is wrong with not speaking with one voice?
The role of the ICAEW is crucial. It has moved boldly for change at a time
when it knows it can dominate the outcome. But its motives are not as
ignoble as often painted. Even the other bodies acknowledge that the
profession gains much of its intellectual drive from auditing and the Big
Six accountancy firms. The ICAEW is vital to the health of both. In the rush
to merge many fear these traditional strengths of the ICAEW will be
undermined and isolated in some new conglomerate of bodies.
The ICAEW rejects the charge that it tried to push Bishop on its members. It
says that to achieve progress, all the bodies agreed to consultation on the
Bishop plan.
Above all there is a sense from all concerned that the profession must put
its own house in order. If the present acrimonious debate achieves anything
it must be a willingness to compromise to achieve change.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries retreat continues in wake of
order data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Treasury market retreated further yesterday after fresh signs that
the economy is growing too fast.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 5/8 at
94 15/16 , with the yield rising to 7.938 per cent. On the short end, the
two-year note was down  3/32 at 99 19/32 , to yield 6.704 per cent.
Bonds showed little early movement as traders awaited the government's
figures on August factory orders. Although the market had been jittery, the
report was not expected to be much of an obstacle. However, bonds tumbled on
the news of a 4.4 per cent gain, after a 2.0 per cent drop the previous
month. Economists were expecting a smaller increase of about 3.5 per cent.
Traders were particularly disturbed by a surprising 2.5 per cent jump in
orders of non-durable goods, an area of slow growth in recent months.
It was another in a series of reports indicating that the Fed had not done
enough yet to slow down the economy. The data seemed to assure that the
central bank would increase short-term interest rates for the sixth time in
the current cycle of tightenings.
Against this backdrop, the fresh declines in bonds put the market in a
precarious position. With Friday's critical employment report fast
approaching, the yield on the long bond was hovering just under the 8.00 per
cent level, an important psychological barrier which might contain any fall
in bond prices on stronger-than-expected jobs data.
The consensus of analysts was that non-farm payrolls had grown by about
250,000 workers last month. But in view of the string of negative surprises
in recent weeks, traders were braced for the worst. Many were speculating
that the big jump in payrolls could motivate the Fed to lift rates
immediately.
European government bonds opened on a weaker note after US bonds had fallen
overnight and tumbled further in the afternoon when Treasuries slid to new
lows on stronger than expected economic data.
The eruption of renewed political turmoil in Italy, pre-election jitters in
Germany and sharp declines in many equity markets further depressed bonds.
Italian bonds nosedived on fears that an investigation into one of the
Italian prime minister's television holdings may implicate Silvio Berlusconi
himself. In late trading the December BTP future on Liffe stood at 97.48,
down 1.54 point, after hitting a low of 96.90.
Bond market participants now worry that the flare-up of political tensions
will complicate the passage of the 1995 budget in parliament by the end of
the year. 'Given that the budget was already not received very
enthusiastically by the market, this worsens the prospects,' said Mr Jose
Luis Alzola, an economist at Salomon Brothers.
Although he said that yesterday's sell-off could be followed by a technical
correction, he added, 'I am sceptical that the spread over bunds can
approach, let alone breach, 400 basis points.' The gap widened to 452 basis
points yesterday.
UK gilts remained surprisingly calm in the face of tumbling markets,
outperforming most of their European counterparts and shrugging off a sharp
fall in the FT-SE 100 index.
The December long gilt futures contract in Liffe eased by  1/4 to 99 1/32 ,
and the 10-year yield gap over German bunds narrowed to 133 basis points.
According to Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets,
gilts have 'perked up' since the recent base rate rise, helped in large part
by the strength of sterling.
German bunds shed about  1/2 point in sympathy with the drop in US
Treasuries. The December bund future on Liffe was down 0.46 point at 87.88
late trading.

FT  06 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Survey highlights
underwriting role of Japanese banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Newly-established subsidiaries of Japanese commercial banks underwrote 6.8
per cent of domestic straight bonds issued in the half-year to September,
according to a survey published yesterday.
The report, by Thomson Corporation, the US financial news service, showed
the companies concluded 123 deals, worth Y111.6bn, for underwriting such
bonds in the period. The companies took a 4.7 per cent share in the
underwriting of all corporate bonds, with 395 deals worth Y178.7bn.
The report gives the first clear picture of the bond underwriting market
since it was liberalised last year. Previously, under rules that strictly
separated securities and banking operations, banks were not permitted to
engage in mainstream securities business. Last year, however, rule changes
allowed banks to set up subsidiaries which may underwrite bonds, but which
are barred from the main area of securities business - equity trading.
Existing brokers have expressed concern at the potential erosion of their
business by the banks, but the figures published yesterday suggest that so
far the encroachment by the seven new bank subsidiaries has been limited.
However, next month, six of Japan's largest commercial banks will launch
their own units and the brokers' share is certain to fall more dramatically.
In the six months to the end of September, IBJ Securities led the way among
the newcomers with 99 contracts worth Y83.3bn.

FT  06 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Matsushita sets terms for
Y200bn issues

<TEXT>
Matsushita Electric Industrial, Japan's largest consumer electronics group,
yesterday set the coupon rates and conversion prices for its two domestic
convertible bond issues totalling Y200bn scheduled to be launched next week.
Concerns of over-supply due to the company's large lot issuance has weighed
on the Tokyo stock market during the past few weeks, but Matsushita
officials said it needed the funds to invest in its expanding multimedia
business and overseas operations.
With investors already worried that Japan Tobacco's Y900bn flotation
scheduled for October 27 may drain liquidity from the stock market,
Matsushita's Y200bn issuance could have adverse effects on the already weak
stock market.
Matsushita said it would issue eight-year and 10-year unsecured convertible
bonds in lots of Y100bn, with coupon rates of 1.3 per cent and 1.4 per cent
respectively. The conversion price for both issues has been set at Y1,620.
The eight-year issue will be convertible from November 1 to March 28 2002,
with the 10-year issue being convertible from the same date to March 30
2004.

FT  06 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: VSNL deal awaits government
approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-awaited international equity offering from VSNL, the Indian
international telecommunications monopoly, is to be delayed pending
government approval, bankers said yesterday.
The delay is likely to be some weeks while an Indian cabinet committee
considers the pricing of the deal, which is led by Kleinwort Benson, Jardine
Fleming and Salomon Brothers.
This delay follows an earlier postponement in May, when market conditions
changed just before the issue was launched, and the minimum price of Rs1,400
a share was seen as too expensive.
The deal was revived last week following the successful issue by Pakistan
Telecom which attracted Dollars 900m from international investors. Following
its handling of that deal, Jardine Fleming was added to the mandate for
VSNL, which is 85-per cent owned by the Indian government.
Bankers believe there is currently good demand at the lower price of between
Rs1,100 and Rs1,200, which would raise about Dollars 650m, but the
government needs to tap that demand before market conditions change.
The BSE 30-share index, which closed at 4,406 last Wednesday, had fallen to
around 4,350 yesterday.
The delay may highlight the decision-making processes of the government,
widely held to blame for the first postponement. But one banker, not linked
to the deal, said the government had made other difficult financial
decisions. He said: 'The decision-making process which corporate financiers
and bankers demand runs into hours and minutes. But it can take a week or
two to get through the necessary processes.'

The World Bank's DM2bn global offering enjoyed a generally warm reception
yesterday in spite of difficult market conditions in Europe and the US.
Lead managers Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley said the deal had been
oversubscribed, and syndicate managers reported significant demand from a
wide spectrum of quality investors including central banks and blue chip
clients across the world.
The offering of five-year bonds was launched on Tuesday and was priced
yesterday at a coupon of 7.25 per cent and a reoffer price of 99.432.
Traders said that many investors were attracted by what they considered a
generous spread of 15 basis points over German government bonds.
'There was a lot of switch trade with investors moving out along the yield
curve from the existing D-Mark bonds in the three- to four-year area, which
are trading tight to bunds,' said one syndicate official.
The success of the offering was also related to the strength of the D-Mark,
dealers said.
'Some investors have taken a bullish stance on the currency and feel
confident about holding D-Marks,' one dealer said.
Elsewhere in the eurobond market, dealers reported that US hedge funds had
sold a significant amount of long-dated bonds over the last few days as they
switched to shorter-dated securities.
Abbey National has filed a shelf registration with the Securities and
Exchange Commission in the US which will allow it to issue up to Dollars 3bn
of medium-term notes.
Mr Fernando Cossio, the Bolivian finance minister, said that Bolivia planned
to return to the capital markets in 1995 with a medium-term bond which would
probably be for Dollars 100m, Reuter reports from Madrid. He said that
Bolivia might also seek a credit rating next year to improve Bolivian
companies' access to international debt markets.

FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Academics open wounds of MG
Corp's oil crisis - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The oddest risk management episode of the past year has become a little
odder. When German metals and engineering group Metallgesellschaft nearly
succumbed to a liquidity crisis last December, it blamed the problems on the
activities of its US subsidiary, MG Corp, in the oil derivatives markets. A
hedging strategy had blown up spectacularly, leading to losses of more than
Dollars 1bn.
The MG story refuses to rest in peace. In recent days, a revisionist view of
the saga has been gaining currency. Were MG Corp's risk managers in fact
right all along? And was it a panic by the group's board - along with the
New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) and US regulators, not to mention a
possible conspiracy by the German group's bankers - that prompted the
losses?
These questions have been raised by US academics and fuelled by speculation
that Deutsche Bank, Metallgesellschaft's lead banker, used the oil trading
episode as an excuse to exert more direct influence over the group.
MG's problems arose from its use of derivatives - mostly futures - to hedge
long-term fixed-price contracts to supply oil products, mainly to small
independent petrol stations around the US. The aim was to protect MG from a
rise in the oil price.
The problems started last autumn as the oil price plunged. A lower oil price
might have added to MG's profits over the long term - with oil products sold
at a higher, fixed rate - but in the short term, it faced two difficulties.
One was that the futures contracts were falling in value, so MG had to put
up additional margin payments with Nymex. With futures positions equivalent
to about 160m barrels of oil, these figures were not small: every Dollars 1
fall in the price of a barrel of oil translated into Dollars 160m of extra
margin.
The second problem was a little more esoteric. The oil yield curve - the
relationship between short-term and long-term oil prices - moved against the
company. Traditionally, short-term oil prices had been above longer-term
ones. But the curve flipped in 1992, with short-term prices sliding lower.
This exposed MG to losses every time it rolled over its futures contracts.
The near-term contracts it sold were worth less than the longer contracts it
replaced them with. Meanwhile, at the long-term end of the oil curve, prices
hardly moved, so the short-term losses were not being matched by profits on
the underlying supply contracts.
The size of MG's market position and the steepness of the oil price slide
eventually precipitated a disaster. MG's bankers had to agree to an
emergency line of credit, and the Metallgesellschaft management was sacked.
Deutsche Bank sent Ms Nancy Kropp, an experienced fire-fighter it had used
in such situations before, to sort out the mess. Her response was to
liquidate many of MG's positions.
This is where the revisionism comes in. Should Ms Kropp have kept rolling
the futures positions forward? Eventually, surely, the losses would be made
up by corresponding profits on the oil supply contracts (or futures prices
would bounce back, as they have done this year). Ms Kropp's approach served
to turn paper losses into real ones.
This argument was murmured by a number of derivatives experts at the time.
Now, it has gained wider circulation in academia. It is floated in a paper
in one journal, The International Economy, written by Mr Steven Hanke,
professor of applied economics at John Hopkins University, and Mr
Christopher Culp, a doctoral candidate at the University of Chicago.
The views are expanded on in a longer, unpublished paper by Mr Culp and Mr
Merton Miller who, among other things, is a Nobel Laureate and director of
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
According to an early draft of the Culp/Miller paper, MG's 'problem was not
with its derivatives group, but more likely with its supervisory board and
supporting banks, who may not have understood the hedging strategy and
forced the premature liquidation of (MG's) hedge positions'. Ms Kropp's team
'might not have fully understood the nature of the original hedging strategy
 -not because of inadequate training and expertise, but simply because the
strategy was complex'.
Comments like these have drawn strong criticism in the 'real world' of
trading rooms, derivatives exchanges and regulators. 'Naive is a really good
word (to describe the academics' criticisms),' says one outsider who was
involved in sorting out the MG mess. And an oil derivatives expert who has
followed the case closely at another trading house says of Ms Kropp's
approach: 'She did a good job.'
'People should only put on positions which they can afford to margin - the
cost of funds is a real consideration,' one person close to the MG problems
says.
Mr Miller has recently received a visit in Chicago from two
Metallgesellschaft representatives, aiming to 'persuade' him to reconsider
his views. A heavy-handed bid by the German group to stall wider debate on
the subject, perhaps? The saga is certain to run on: a revised version of Mr
Miller's paper with Mr Culp is due to be published shortly, and will no
doubt be pored over for signs of recantation.

Three Japanese trading companies have been ordered to pay penalty taxes
totalling Y2.3bn (Dollars 23m) for failure to declare their incomes properly
for the last three years.
The Osaka Regional Taxation Bureau said Marubeni Corporation, Nissho Iwai
Corporation and Sumitomo Corporation between them misrepresented corporate
expenditures of Y4.9bn.
The companies reported that sum to the bureau as commissions for hiring
business consultants related to transactions with oil-producing countries.
The bureau noted, however, that the figures were not related to individual
deals, and concluded that the companies fabricated the commissions to lower
their total incomes and evade paying corporate taxes. The commissions were
not regarded as costs, but as social expenses or payments for unknown
purposes.
Marubeni failed to declare Y2.1bn, Nissho Iwai Y1.6bn and Sumitomo Y1.2bn.
Penalty taxes of Y980m, Y770m and Y590m were imposed.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Henderson Land Development Company, one of Hong Kong's largest property
developers, yesterday reported a 51 per cent advance in net profits, to
HKDollars 6.04bn (USDollars 782.4m) for the year to June 30, up from
HKDollars 4bn the previous year and comfortably ahead of market
expectations.
Directors are marking the results with a cash bonus of HKDollars 1 a share,
on top of a proposed HKDollars 1.20 dividend. This will bring the total for
the year to HKDollars 1.60, an increase of 45 per cent over the previous
year's payout.
Earnings per share rose in line with total earnings, to HKDollars 3.78 from
HKDollars 2.51.
The Henderson Investment subsidiary reported a 16 per cent increase in net
profits, to HKDollars 1.13bn from HKDollars 977m, with earnings per share
improving 9 per cent to 47 cents from 43 cents.
Shareholders are to receive a final dividend of 20 cents for a total of 29
cents, an increase of 16 per cent on the previous year. There will also be a
warrant bonus issue of one warrant for every 10 shares held.
Mr Lee Shau-kee, chairman, said credit-tightening measures in China had
triggered a temporary slowdown in the local residential property market
early in the financial year.
The subsequent recovery was tempered in March by news of Hong Kong
government measures to curb home prices. Mr Lee said these moves, twinned
with a further tightening on lending from the banks, had sent home prices
tumbling by between 15 per cent and 20 per cent and dampened turnover.

FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Rabobank to pay ADollars 102m
for rural bank in Australia

<TEXT>
Rabobank, the large Netherlands-based co-operative banking group which
specialises in the food and agri-business sector, is to buy the Primary
Industry Bank of Australia for ADollars 102m (USDollars 75.5m).
PIBA, which is being sold by the state-owned Bank of Western Australia
(BankWest) as a prelude to privatisation next year, is a significant lender
to the country's rural sector. Its assets at the end of March were ADollars
1.83bn, and its main focus recently has been the provision of rural mortgage
loans. It has operations in Australia and New Zealand.
In spite of the difficulties experienced by farmers in the 1990s, PIBA has
been consistently profitable, with after-tax operating profit in the year
ended September 1993 amounting to ADollars 11.4m. In the six months to the
end of March it made ADollars 9.22m.
Yesterday, Rabobank said the acquisition formed part of its strategy of
building up operations in the Asian region.
The Dutch organisation, whose 1993 assets stood at about Fl 253bn (Dollars
145.4bn), has offices in Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia, and expects to
add a presence in Thailand and Malaysia. It also plans to open an office in
Shanghai in a few weeks.
Rabobank said it had 'a special interest in Australia'. It sees the country
as a low-cost agricultural producer and a potential beneficiary of the
Uruguay Round in the Gatt trade negotiations, which will generally lower
trade restrictions.
BankWest, which bought PIBA in 1987 when it was a much smaller organisation,
said the proceeds from the sale would be used to bolster its capital
position ahead of privatisation. It said it 'made strategic sense for PIBA
to be owned by a specialist agricultural bank with the capacity to sustain
the levels of wholesale funding required for future growth'.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US-based rating agency, immediately lifted its credit
rating for PIBA's long-term debt to AA+ from A, and the short-term rating to
A1+ from A1.

Guoco Group, the Hong Kong-based financial services and garment company
controlled by the Malaysian Quek family, yesterday reported a sharp rise in
net profits, to HKDollars 1.3bn (USDollars 168.4m) from HKDollars 573.8m for
the year to June 30.
The group made HKDollars 309m from investment and property sales, which were
taken above the line. Earnings did not include transfers to inner reserves,
although this practice - now widespread among the colony's banks - is being
phased out.
Earnings per share rose to HKDollars 3.43 from HKDollars 1.64. A final
dividend of 45 cents is recommended. This, taken with the interim dividend,
marks a 23 per cent increase on the previous year's payout.
The result was boosted by Dao Heng Bank, the group's main operating
subsidiary which was spun off in a separate listing last December. The
group, which has 90 branches in Hong Kong, saw net profits surge to
HKDollars 1bn from HKDollars 400.8m.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Survey of The Principality of Liechtenstein (9): Nicely,
thank you - Banking services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreigners who think of Liechtenstein as an offshore banking centre and tax
haven are often startled to discover that the principality has only five
banks, all of them locally owned and controlled, writes Ian Rodger.
Moreover, Liechtenstein cannot really be described as a banking centre in
itself. Rather, it is a part of the much larger Swiss banking scene, using
the same currency and, by and large, the same rules.
Until two years ago, the principality counted only three banks, Bank in
Liechtenstein (BIL), the largest, which is owned by the royal family,
Verwaltungs- und Privat-Bank, a bank set up by a prominent trustee-lawyer in
1956, and Liechtensteinische Landesbank, which is state owned.
The government long held a policy of rejecting applications for new banking
licences on the grounds that the principality was too small and had
insufficient labour to staff and supervise any more banks.
This attitude was relaxed slightly two years ago in anticipation of the
country joining the European Economic Area, and since then, two new banks,
Neue Bank and Centrum Bank, have started up.
While the three original banks are licensed as universal banks, the main
business of all of them is asset management for individual clients, with
most referred from local trustee-lawyers.
VP Bank, for example, says three quarters of its clients are from outside
Liechtenstein.
Over the past few years, the banks have prospered enormously from this
arrangement. In 1980, the combined balance sheets of the three stood at
SFr4.4bn. At the end of last year, the five had combined total assets of
SFr22bn.
Even the entry of two new banks appears to have been well timed. 'It has
been a good time to set up. A lot of money came from Switzerland to
Liechtenstein last year,' says Mr Heinz Batliner, chairman of VP Bank.
However, the cosy arrangements of the past are about to be jostled a bit.
Assuming that the principality joins the EEA, it will have to open the way
for banks registered in any EEA country to set up an office in
Liechtenstein.
Opinions vary on how many EEA banks will choose to take advantage of this
opening, but most people think the number will be small. 'In my view, we
will not see an influx of credit institutions,' says Mr Hubert Buchel, a
senior official in the economics ministry. 'The principle of home country
control means that they would be supervised by their home country anyway.
And people bringing money to Liechtenstein will probably continue to prefer
to put it in an institution supervised by Liechtenstein,' Mr Buchel
predicts.
Mr Batliner points out that any newcomers would also have difficulty finding
adequate staff.
BIL, which itself has a large international presence, welcomes the idea of
more newcomers. 'We have no problems with more competition. We are present
throughout the world. If other good banks come here, that will make us even
better,' says Mr Fritz Buhler, chief executive.
The more substantial concern is how long and to what extent the principality
will be able to hold on to its key advantages as an offshore financial
centre - mainly bank secrecy and its very low taxes.
The Swiss, for example, are currently pressing the Liechtenstein authorities
to accept Swiss practice in terms of due diligence. This would require banks
to know the identity of the beneficial owners of all their accounts. Under
Liechtenstein practice, this rule is waived if the account has been referred
by a registered local lawyer-trustee.
Although the difference seems marginal, Liechtensteiners acknowledge that a
lot of money has flowed from Switzerland to the principality in the last
couple of years since the Swiss tightened their disclosure requirements.
In the longer term, bankers suspect that pressure from other EEA countries
will build up to raise taxes on the letter box companies to normal levels.
That would gradually dry up the flow of funds from the lawyer-trustees and
force the banks to become more competitive fund managers.
'We set up a sales department five years ago to sensitise our staff to the
likelihood that we will not always be able to count on new clients coming
through the door,' says Rene Ott, international director of BIL.
In anticipation of joining the EEA, Liechtenstein is updating many of its
financial laws.
A law making money laundering from drugs or insider trading activity a
criminal offence was passed two years ago and will come into effect
automatically with the entry into the EEA. The government intends to widen
it to cover all types of money laundering.
It is also revising its investment fund law, with the hope of stimulating
this so far undeveloped sector. And a new law on insurance supervision is
being planned. At the moment, the principality has no insurance industry,
and some financiers see opportunities in the offshore captive reinsurance
field.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Survey of The Principality of Liechtenstein (8): The Swiss
are watchful - Tax haven role leaves postage stamps in the shade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Liechtenstein's most famous business used to be the issuing of exotic
postage stamps. Unfortunately, philately is on the wane these days, and the
principality has moved on to other things.
Now it is known best as a tax haven.
The sector achieved especial notoriety three years ago when Mr Robert
Maxwell's empire collapsed. Much of the former UK media tycoon's
skullduggery was executed secretly through Liechtenstein trusts, including
the rather grandly named Maxwell Foundation.
The principality's trustee-lawyers are now in the midst of a tricky row with
Switzerland which fears that Liechtenstein is competing unfairly for this
business.
Liechtenstein's approach to being a tax haven has been an unusual one. It
did not want a huge influx of foreign banks and fund managers overwhelming
the local population as has happened in Monaco or Jersey, so it maintained
severe restrictions on banking activity.
Until two years ago, there were only three banks in the principality; today
there are five.
Rather, it proposed to the world's rich that they could set up unusually
flexible Liechtenstein domiciled companies, foundations and trusts. Through
these entities, they could hide the ownership of their liquid assets on
which taxation is, in most cases, a nominal SFr1,000 a year, regardless of
the size of turnover, profit or assets.
However, because of the paucity of local banks and professional fund
managers, the funds in the trusts and foundations have to be held and
managed mainly outside Liechtenstein.
It has been a phenomenally successful strategy. Local estimates, based on a
simple calculation from the tax take from these domiciled entities, put
their number at something like 70,000, more than double the principality's
population. Leading bankers and trustees estimate that 60 per cent of
Liechtenstein's tax revenues, some SFr500m a year, come directly and
indirectly from the financial sector.
The Liechtenstein approach has also, notwithstanding the Maxwell case, been
remarkably troublefree. No case of drug money laundering has ever been
uncovered there, for example.
Trustees say that this is mainly because they are in a small, tightly knit
community. A black sheep would not be tolerated. And because their
businesses too remain relatively small, they have the time to examine every
transaction that passes through their offices.
There is increasing evidence that foreign clients are comfortable with
Liechtenstein entities. Mr Peter Ritter, chairman of Prasidial, one of the
largest trust firms, points out that the average age of Liechtenstein trusts
and foundations is about 15 years, compared with only six or seven years in
the British Virgin Islands. 'With all the problems we have had, we are still
doing our job,' Mr Ritter says.
However, their relatively tranquil life is now being shaken up. The main
immediate threat comes from the Swiss, who have launched a two pronged
attack to learn the identity of their clients.
Last November, the Swiss people endorsed a government plan to introduce a
value added tax on all goods and services. At the time, nobody thought much
about Liechtenstein, the Swiss simply assuming that the principality would
fall into line and do the same.
The Swiss finance ministry also assumed that it would collect the VAT in
Liechtenstein, just as it collects the current sales tax on goods there.
The trustees initially fought to be exempted from VAT on the grounds that
their clients were foreign, but eventually retreated because the basic
principle of their activity is that the trusts and foundations they set up
for these clients are domestic.
But they are horrified at the prospect of turning over their client invoices
to Swiss VAT inspectors. The Liechtenstein government took up their cause
and made clear to the Swiss finance ministry that, as a sovereign state, it
had the right to set and collect its own VAT.
The Swiss finance ministry balked, claiming that it feared that
Liechtenstein would administer the tax in such a way as to give its
financial businesses an advantage over Swiss ones. There were threats of
cancelling the bilateral currency treaty, under which Liechtenstein banks
have the implicit ultimate backing of the Swiss National Bank.
Liechtenstein then agreed to make the rates and conditions of the tax
identical to those in Switzerland. The dispute has still not been settled,
but it is difficult to see how the Swiss can prevail.
Meanwhile, the Swiss are pressuring Liechtenstein to adopt a due diligence
agreement that is basically identical to theirs. The main difference between
the two at the moment is that Switzerland requires bankers to know the
beneficial owners of all their accounts while Liechtenstein permits an
exception from the rule provided that a registered trustee knows the
beneficial owner's identity.
Liechtensteiners admit that their practice gives additional comfort to some
clients, in that they know that fewer employees, auditors, inspectors or
bureaucrats can find out their identity so the risk of disclosure is perhaps
less than in Switzerland.
But they say there is no difference in substance so the Swiss should
retreat. Moreover, they say, they are about to put their due diligence
agreement into law, whereas the Swiss one is only an agreement among
bankers.
In the longer term, the trustees fear pressure from neighbouring European
countries on Liechtenstein to raise its taxes. 'Liechtenstein should be
preserved as an offshore centre in Europe. It is better than recycling
investment funds through the Caribbean,' says Mr Edmund Frick, president of
the Liechtenstein Treuhander Vereinigung.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Survey of The Principality of Liechtenstein (10): High-class
family business / Profile of Bank In Liechtenstein (BIL-GT)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be difficult to find a better business address in Liechtenstein
than that of the BIL-GT group, formerly known as the Bank in Liechtenstein.
The group is controlled, to the extent of 99.7 per cent of the voting
capital, by the princely family through the Prince of Liechtenstein
Foundation, although there is a public float of some 727,500 participation
certificates.
BIL-GT has grown very rapidly in the past decade to become a global asset
management group of respectable rank, with SFr54bn in funds under management
and total assets of SFr9.5bn.
As recently as 1981, Bank in Liechtenstein was an insignificant financial
institution with 150 employees, all of them in Liechtenstein.
That was the year that Christian Norgren, a young Swedish banker, was hired
by the princely family to build it up, particularly outside the
principality.
Over the next few years, there was a flurry of acquisitions, three in
Germany, and one in each of the UK, Switzerland and the US, culminating in
1989 with the Pounds 91.5m takeover of GT Management, one of the leading UK
fund management groups.
Unfortunately, in the same year Mr Norgren was caught in an insider trading
operation and left the group.
Over the next three years, BIL had considerable difficulty integrating its
big UK investment, as reflected both in sluggish income and equity price
growth. Net income fell three per cent in 1992 to SFr81m. The BIL
participation certificates tumbled from a high of SFr850 in 1989 to a low of
SFr260 at the end of 1992.
At the time, there were still four GT subsidiaries outside the UK and three
BIL subsidiaries outside Liechtenstein and very little contact among them.
'There was a total lack of coordination,' a BIL executive admits today.
In early 1993, the group considered selling GT, but eventually agreed to
keep it, provided that directors from both sides would pursue a sensible
integration.
Prince Philipp, the reigning prince's younger brother and the group's
chairman, became chief executive and an executive committee of six directors
was established.
Among the simpler changes was to have GT use BIL more and more as the
group's bank, notably for foreign exchange, money market transactions and
financing funds' leverage. 'A year ago, the bank got no deals from GT. Now
it gets deals every day,' says Rene Ott, managing director of the bank.
A more important strategic realignment put GT in charge of global
institutional fund management and BIL in command of global private banking.
Last year's group net profits soared 75 per cent to SFr141.3m, but Mr Ott
says the result did not yet reflect the impact of the restructuring. Cost
savings are beginning to be seen in the 1994 accounts and will become more
apparent in the next couple of years, he says.
In the first half of this year, in defiance of the general trend among Swiss
banks, BIL raised its net income another hefty 40 per cent to SFr96.6m. It
attributed this continuing progress mainly to its concentration on asset
management.
Commissions and fees account for about 70 per cent of its revenues while the
more volatile trading business, which has hurt many other banks this year,
represents only 8 per cent of total revenues.
While the BIL group is large, it does not believe it has yet reached a
sufficient size to achieve its goals. 'Our goal is to be one of the major
privately owned international portfolio managers. We think we need to be
managing at least SFr100bn,' Mr Ott says.
As a result both GT and the bank are still expanding aggressively, using
each other's infrastructure when possible. GT, which has traditionally been
strong in the UK and the US, is opening offices in Madrid and Paris next
year and strengthening its presence in Germany. The bank has just opened an
information office in Luxembourg.
This does not mean it is foresaking Liechtenstein, but the group has little
opportunity for growth there. It also suspects that the principality will
have difficulty maintaining its competitiveness as a tax haven over the
longer term.
Significant top level personnel changes have just been made. Mr Peter
Stevens, chief executive of GT in London since the acquisition, is leaving
the executive committee, although he will continue to chair the audit
committee. Coincidentally, Mr Fritz Buhler, chairman, bank, is stepping down
and will be succeeded by Hans Haumer, former chief executive of GiroCredit,
the third largest Austrian bank.

a wake-up call - The government is hoping that a third force will trigger
stronger competition

Bouygues, the French construction group best known for public works and
motorways, is taking a gamble on mobile telephones. The French government,
in turn, is taking a gamble on Bouygues.
After two unsuccessful attempts to enter the French market, the company was
on Tuesday declared the victor in a fierce contest for the third mobile
telecoms licence.
The strength of the competition - which pitted Bouygues against two other
French industrial giants, Alcatel Alsthom and Lyonnaise des Eaux - reflected
the importance of the stakes. All three rivals saw the potential for a new
lucrative market, while Bouygues regarded the licence as a central plank in
its strategy of diversifying away from cyclical construction and property
markets into media and telecommunications.
At the Ministry of Industry, Post and Telecommunications, the stakes are
equally high. The new licence is regarded as a vital stimulus for France's
lagging mobile telephones services and a means of narrowing the gap with its
European neighbours. 'It is a wake-up call for the sector,' says one
telecoms analyst in Paris.
For the objectives of Bouygues and the government to be satisfied, they must
catchup.
At the end of last month, France counted 730,000 subscribers to mobile phone
networks, less than half of the number in Italy and less than one-third of
the 2.7m in the UK. But the French market has been showing a rapid growth
rate.
France Telecom which, along with Generale des Eaux, operates the existing
mobile networks, says it is winning between 1,500 and 1,800 subscribers a
day, partly because of a cut in tariffs in June. The monthly subscription
rate, for example, was reduced sharply, from FFr250 to FFr190.
In spite of this growth the penetration of mobile services remains well
below the European average and is particularly low among the general public.
'So far it has been the business community which have accounted for
virtually all of the demand,' says a ministry official.
Part of the explanation lies in the lack of competition. Mr Didier Pouillot,
an analyst at Idate, the communications research institute, said the French
market had, until recently, resembled a duopoly.
Another analyst adds: 'There was little competition on prices, and SFR (the
telecoms subsidiary of Generale des Eaux) has been slow to develop its
infrastructure.'
By introducing a third force, the government hopes to trigger stronger
competition. Moreover, by selecting the DCS 1800 standard for the network,
officials believe the new operator will be well positioned to lure the wider
market. DCS 1800 is a digital standard which is a variant of the GSM system
used by the existing French operators and by most international groups.
Industry observers and French officials claim DCS 1800 is well suited to
consumers and urban areas because the terminals are lighter than other
systems and it can operate from a network of small cellular stations.
Like other standards, however, the new network does not come cheap.
According to its offer submission, Bouygues plans to invest about FFr11.7bn
(Dollars 2.2bn) over the next 10 years, although the burden will be shared
with its consortium partners. These comprise Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK, US
West, JC Decaux, the French property group, Banque Nationale de Paris and
Paribas.
Most observers believe the high development costs should be more than
matched by the potential returns. 'Naturally the start-up costs will be
high, and competition is likely to have become more intense by the time
services are launched in 1996 or 1997,' says one telecoms industry analyst.
'But this is a strong growth market.'
Just how strong is hard to predict. In its bid, Bouygues forecasts the
number of mobile subscribers in France will rise to 1.5m at the end of next
year and to 6.6m in the year 2000. By then it expects to hold 18.6 per cent
of the market and receive annual revenues of FFr4.72bn.
Mr Philippe Montagner, chairman of Bouygues Telecom, said yesterday the
project should break even at an operating level in about three years. The
group's capital will be reinforced by a FFr1bn rights issue, which was
announced yesterday.
The projections are supported by several considerations. In particular, the
licence grants exclusive rights for the standard to the five biggest cities
for the next four years and a 15-year national mandate. 'I can't see that it
will be too hard to make a reasonable return,' says one analyst, as
investors pushed Bouygues shares up by FFr9 to FFr587.
For Bouygues, the longer-term returns should help offset the cyclical nature
of its traditional construction activities. Last year, losses in its
property activities prompted a fall in net profits, to FFr469m from FFr685m
 -justifying, says the group, its search for more stable, higher margin
businesses.
The move into mobile telecommunications is not the first step. The company
has a controlling 34 per cent stake in TF1, the national television network,
finances films and operates a radio messaging network. But the award of the
licence marks a watershed. 'Bouygues is now firmly in the ranks of a
diversified conglomerate, for better or for worse,' says one construction
industry analyst.
Most believe it is for the better. Although the cost of the project is
expected to depress earnings growth from 1995, Bouygues should benefit from
the non-cyclical nature of the business and its relatively high margins.

FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Minister justifies the selection
of Bouygues

A consortium led by Bouygues was selected as the winning candidate for
France's third mobile telephones network because the construction group had
been most persistent in seeking to enter the market, Mr Gerard Longuet,
minister for industry, post and telecommunications, said yesterday.
Mr Longuet said Alcatel Alsthom, the closest rival in the contest, was
disadvantaged by it being an important supplier to France Telecom, which
operates one of the existing mobile telecommunications networks. 'Being
already the biggest supplier it could not become the biggest competitor,' he
said.
His comments were part of an attempt to justify the process on which the
decision was reached. Unlike in some other countries, the licence award was
not based on cash offers but on the presentation of business plans,
including technical, commercial and investment proposals.
Mr Longuet said the report by the managing director of the post and telecoms
authority, which evaluated the bids from Bouygues, Alcatel and Lyonnaise des
Eaux, the utilities group which was the third contender, would be published
soon.
The selection process was sensitive because of the media and political
influence of the three competitors.
Some observers claimed that Bouygues' position as controlling shareholder in
TF1, the national television network, had given it an advantage with
presidential elections due by mid-1995. 'It is a far from negligible asset
in a pre-election period,' said Liberation, the daily newspaper.
The rival groups, however, also wield influence. Alcatel owns two of
France's leading weekly news magazines, Le Point and L'Express, while Mr
Jerome Monod, chairman of Lyonnaise des Eaux, is a former aide to Mr Jacques
Chirac, leader of the Gaullist RPR party, and a rival of Mr Edouard
Balladur, the prime minister, for the conservative candidacy in the
presidential elections.
The sensitivity of the decision prompted delays in announcing the winner and
a demand for more information by Mr Balladur. Bouygues yesterday denied it
had made any changes to its proposals.
Alcatel said yesterday it respected the decision and planned to use its
resources for similar developments outside of France. Lyonnaise des Eaux
said it would also continue with its development in the telecommunications
sector.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Survey of The Principality of Liechtenstein (7): Building
for success - Andrew Fisher studies innovation at HILTI Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Innovation is very, very important to us,' says Mr Pius Baschera, head of
the executive board at Hilti, the Liechtenstein-based maker of fastening
systems for the construction industry.
This year, the company is spending SFr70m (Pounds 35m), roughly 3 per cent
of turnover, on research and development. It is also introducing more than
50 new products to its range of power drills, screw- and nail-guns, chisels,
and pneumatic and adhesive fastening equipment. But, says Mr Baschera,
innovation at the company goes far beyond the products. It extends to the
manufacturing process, logistics and marketing.
Hilti, which employs more than 12,000 people worldwide, is also subjecting
its management structures and attitudes to a decisive blast of innovation.
It has laid down that no board member should stay in office beyond the age
of 56 - the average age of the present board is 46 - and that their
contracts should run for three years, with renewal depending on performance.
The idea says, Mr Michael Hilti, chairman of the (non-executive or
supervisory) board of directors and son of the founder, Mr Martin Hilti, is
to keep management alert and to encourage those still climbing the corporate
ladder. 'We want to give young people a chance to move into the high ranks.
If they're 40 to 45 years old, they can really contribute their best to the
company.'
Mr Baschera, he noted, was only 39 when he joined the executive board. 'It's
too long if you stay in the board until 60.' Baschera is now 44 and the
younger Hilti 48. The oldest board member is 54. Two executive board members
in their mid-50s retired last year after the new rule came in; one is on the
non-executive board, the other has joined the trust owning the shares in the
company. Michael Hilti also left the executive board, stepping up to the
supervisory board in a full-time role when his father bowed out at nearly
80.
Because Hilti's markets are so widely spread - last year's turnover of
SFr2.1bn was achieved in more than 100 countries from plants in Germany, the
UK, the US, Austria and Hungary, as well as Liechtenstein - it is keen to
focus its manufacturing and sales efforts as efficiently as possible. Thus
it has changed the way its plants are organised, reordered its sales force
and tightened its management.
Its 6,000 salesmen now concentrate on specialist customer areas such as
construction, mechanical and electrical engineering, general industry and
government. This segmentation approach, already introduced in Germany (its
biggest customer, accounting for 20 per cent of business) has led to much
closer links with customers, says Mr Michael Hilti.
The company's new computerised information system has made it possible for
managers to be much more mobile and in touch with customers and the
shopfloor. 'We want people to be really down in the organisation, especially
top management. We don't want them sitting in a glass house, however nice it
is,' he adds, gesturing to the big office window and the mountains beyond.
Hilti also places great stress on educating up-and-coming managers and
developing their potential. 'We give responsibility very young, earlier than
other companies,' explains Mr Baschera. 'We have a lot of general managers
in their early 30s and our experience with them has been very good.'
On the manufacturing side, the company has assigned each plant a core
technology, thus concentrating its efforts. It has also introduced a more
team-oriented approach in the plants, with managers responsible for a range
of functions such as quality, maintenance, planning and personnel. This has
speeded up manufacturing times and boosted productivity, though Mr Baschera
declines to give figures.
As well as motivating younger managers, Mr Hilti says the more streamlined
management structure keeps the more experienced ones on their toes and
prevents empire-building. Managers tend to stay in their jobs for a maximum
of five years. 'This gives air to the system.'

FT  06 OCT 94 / Survey of The Principality of Liechtenstein (6): Birds of
passage - Tourists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Drive into the centre of Vaduz on a normal day and you will see at least a
dozen large coaches in the central parking lots and scores of tourists
ambling about the town centre.
Tourism, it would seem, is a brisk trade in Liechtenstein.
Well, yes and no. In terms of numbers, it looks pretty impressive for a
small place. Up to 150 coaches a day, 72,000 visitors a year, 150,000 bed
nights. Mr Berthold Konrad, director of the tourist bureau, estimates it
accounts for a tenth of the principality's economic activity.
But behind those figures are some disturbing trends. The number of visitors,
for example, is down from a peak of nearly 86,000 in 1985. Bed nights have
fallen from 168,000 in 1985. And there would appear to be no stopping the
downward trend.
The problem is that Liechtenstein is so small that it does not have enough
attractions for most classes of tourist today. It is not the sort of place
you would take your family for a fortnight's summer holiday. While the
mountainous back country is beautiful and the Swiss and Austrian Alps are
nearby, it would be more sensible and probably cheaper to stay somewhere in
Austria or Switzerland and make a one day excursion to Liechtenstein.
Similarly, the winter sports facilities, mainly the ski resort at Malbun,
are too modest to appeal to other than weekenders.
The result is that the principality has increasingly become a two or three
hour stop for coach tours. They come, they have lunch, they visit the
prince's castle and the splendid museums, they buy some stamps and post some
postcards and they leave.
'Many people who come in coaches do not even know they are in
Liechtenstein,' Mr Konrad complains.
Since the country has a customs union with Switzerland, there are no
Liechtenstein border controls. Swiss immigration and customs officials man
the border crossings with Austria.
To meet the demands of those who want a visa stamp in their passports, the
tourist office hires a student in summer who provides the service for SFr2.
Even the principality's once lucrative stamp business is declining, as more
and more children travel rather than learn their world geography through
philately. The government issues only four stamps a year and pegs the prices
so that children in developing countries can afford them.
The tourism office tries gamely to attract new custom, always coming up with
new suggestions for coach tour operators to lengthen their Liechtenstein
schedules. In cooperation with hotels, it has begun to publish regional
itineraries using the principality as a base, complete with detailed menus.
But it seems to be rowing against the current. As he admits, there is not
much night life in Vaduz. Many of the principality's visitors prefer to stay
in Zurich.
The hotel trade has to struggle constantly to square a vicious circle.
Chronic labour shortages mean hotel operators have to import workers and pay
high wages. But their room rates have to remain competitive with nearby
Austrian and Swiss prices.
'I pay higher wages than Zurich hotel operators but people would not pay
Zurich rates for rooms here,' one Vaduz hotel manager says.
Many hotel operators have already given up, calculating that their valuable
land can be put to more profitable use. The number of beds has plunged from
1,760 in 1980 to 1,400.
Mr Konrad says it is difficult to mobilise popular support for the tourism
industry. 'In Vaduz, they think of it as a traffic problem,' he says.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Survey of The Principality of Liechtenstein (4): Tiddler in
deep water - Ian Rodger examines the foreign policy options of a mini-state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Liechtenstein has been unusually active in the diplomatic field in the past
few years.
In 1990, it established a mission at the United Nations In New York. The
following year it opened one in Geneva accredited to the international
organisations there and last year it set up an office in Brussels.
The principality makes no pretence of having any power whatsoever in
international affairs. Its main purpose in building up an international
presence is to secure its legitimacy as an independent state. This, in turn,
its leaders believe, contributes to the credibility of its tax haven in
particular and to the health of the economy in general.
After living under the diplomatic wing of Switzerland for most of this
century, the principality first struck out on its own in 1978 joining the
Council of Europe. In 1982, it achieved special status at the Conference for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in Vienna and it became a full
member of the United Nations in 1990.
In 1991, it became a full member of the European Free Trade Association
(Efta), mainly to negotiate special exemptions from the freedom of movement
requirements of the European Economic Area (EEA) treaty then being
negotiated with the European Union (EU). Until then, it had been an
associate member under Switzerland's wing. And earlier this year, it joined
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
Ms Andrea Willi, foreign minister, says the principality puts most of its
efforts on the international stage into good causes - human rights,
environmental protection, women's rights and culture.
It has been especially active in the area of minority rights. In July, the
reigning prince donated Dollars 467,000 to Princeton University in the US to
fund a research programme on the right to self-determination. 'We really
care about this subject. We are a small country. Our borders are at the
door. Every day we see our limits,' Ms Willi says.
On a bilateral level, efforts are concentrated almost entirely on
Switzerland. Although the principality was established by the Austrian
Emperor Karl VI in 1719 as a seat for the noble Viennese Liechtenstein
family, its people have always been culturally closer to the Swiss than to
the Austrians. Thus, when the Austro-Hungarian empire collapsed in 1921, it
was no trauma for the principality to attach itself to Switzerland. It
adopted the Swiss franc as a national currency in 1921 and concluded a
postal treaty with its neighbour in the same year. A customs union was
established in 1924 and a formal currency union settled in 1980.
Bilateral relations over most of this century have been remarkably tranquil.
It is only since December, 1992 that things have become complicated. In that
month, Liechtensteiners voted in a referendum in favour of joining the EEA,
the expanded free trade area proposed between the EU and Efta countries. But
the Swiss voted to stay out.
Thus, the question arose of how Liechtenstein could respect its obligation
to provide for the freedom of movement of goods with other EEA countries and
adherence to EEA standards and still maintain its customs union with
Switzerland.
It has taken a long time to find an answer to this question although
Liechtensteiners blame their own frequent changes of government in the past
two years for much of the delay. Officials say there were very few problem
areas anyway, because the Swiss have increasingly aligned their industrial
standards on those of the EU.
One important exception is the motor business. Switzerland has long
protected its car dealers from foreign competition with a panoply of special
specifications for cars to be registered in the country.
The elegantly simple solution that has been found is that a Liechtensteiner
will be able to buy either an EEA or a Swiss specification car, but when it
comes to selling it, he can sell it only to another Liechtensteiner or to
someone in the area whose specifications it respects.
This system will be easy to police because the Swiss car authorities would
simply refuse to register an EEA specification car.
Most other goods on which standards differ are industrial intermediates,
such as poisonous substances, and these will be controlled at company level.
According to Willy Frommelt, director-general of the Liechtenstein Industry
Association, the principality will need the grand total of five VAT
inspectors.
Final agreement on the revisions to the customs union was achieved this
week. Liechtenstein must now present the details of the deal to its EEA
partners for their approval and then give its own people an opportunity to
approve or reject it in a referendum.
Assuming all this can be accomplished in the next three months so that
Liechtenstein joins the EEA on January 1, the principality's anxieties will
not be at an end.
That would leave only Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein in Efta, and
only Iceland and Liechtenstein as non EU members of the EEA. And it is
likely that Switzerland, and perhaps Iceland too, will at some point join
the EU.
Liechtenstein, on the other hand, has no intention of joining the EU. 'It is
not on the agenda,' declares Ms Willi. Being such a small state, it would be
unable to fulfil the responsibilities of a full member. Moreover, it fears
that EU laws would eventually hurt its tax haven.
The prince and government leaders agree that the EEA is just right for
Liechtenstein, giving it most of the advantages of EU membership with
protections for its economic and social structures.
However, the future of both Efta, which has a modest permanent bureaucracy,
and the EEA do not look exactly secure. Ms Willi makes clear that there is
little that tiny Liechtenstein can do, other than make suggestions.
She says, for example, that EFTA and the EEA might be suitable routes
towards EU membership for some eastern and southern European countries. Efta
had third country trade agreements with 11 countries, and the EU had
invested a lot of time and thought in creating the EEA. 'It is a useful
model,' she says.

Lend Lease, the Australian financial services group, is linking with
International Business Machines of the US to sell information technology
services to Australia's business community.
They will offer services ranging from management of desktop systems to
business recovery services.
The two companies estimate the current IT services market in Australia is
worth about ADollars 2bn (USDollars 1.4bn) a year.
They aim to capture at least a 30 per cent share within the next five years.
The services will be marketed through a new joint venture company,
Integrated Systems Solutions Corporation, which will be 65 per cent owned by
IBM Australia and 35 per cent by Lend Lease.
No financial details of the partners' investments were revealed.
However, the new organisation will be a substantial business, employing some
1,300 people.
About 750 staff will come from IBM, and the balance from Lend Lease.
Under the terms of the agreement, both Lend Lease and IBM will source their
own IT requirements from ISSC.

FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Borden warns of losses in third
quarter after charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Borden, the troubled US food group that last month agreed to a Dollars 2bn
takeover by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street investment firm,
yesterday warned that it expected to report unquantified net losses for the
third quarter after taking pre-tax charges of between Dollars 150m and
Dollars 200m.
Borden's warning came as other parties continued to explore the possibility
of launching an offer to rival KKR's agreed bid. Japonica Partners, a Rhode
Island investment firm headed by Mr Paul Kazarian, said it was preparing a
higher-value proposal for Borden shareholders and urged the company to halt
further asset liquidations.
About Dollars 95m of the quarter's charges arose because proceeds from the
disposal of discontinued operations were less than expected, Borden said.
Another Dollars 50m was attributable to 'transaction fees and other
expenses,' mostly the fees Borden has agreed to pay KKR in connection with
the takeover.
Borden said the third-quarter results would also include charges for the
write-down of certain assets, although these would be offset by the reversal
of an unused portion of the restructuring charges taken by the company last
year.
Some of that planned restructuring would not take place following the deal
with KKR, Borden said.
In last year's third quarter, the company reported net losses of Dollars
9.4m.

stake from Esso

<TEXT>
Saga Petroleum, Norway's largest independent oil company, is to buy a 50 per
cent stake in the undeveloped, 80m-barrel Norwegian North Sea Fenris oil
field from Esso Exploration and Production Norway.
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, is the field's operator and holds
the remaining 50 per cent stake. This gives it pre-emptive purchase rights
until the end of this month to acquire the 50 per cent shareholding sought
by Saga. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Analysts in Oslo say Statoil is unlikely to exercise these rights, because
it would want to spread the estimated NKr3bn (Dollars 620m) costs to develop
the field. No other Norwegian oil field is wholly-owned by one company, they
also noted.
Fenris is in the southern part of the North Sea in 85m of water. A
development plan for the field may be lodged with petroleum authorities in
1995 and, if approved, production could commence by the summer of 1996.
Several development schemes are being considered, but because the field is
not close to existing infrastructure, the development would have to include
oil processing and off-loading facilities.
The deal between Saga and Esso will also have to be approved by the oil and
industry ministry, but this is not expected until Statoil declares its
intention.

FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Bayer plans worldwide generic
drugs chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bayer, the German drugs and chemicals company, is planning to set up a chain
of businesses around the world to sell unbranded, generic drugs. Generics is
one of the fastest growing segments of the pharmaceuticals business.
Bayer is creating a joint venture with US generics specialist Schein. This
is the first large deal with Schein since Bayer paid Dollars 310m for a 28.3
per cent stake in March.
Mr David Ebsworth, head of Bayer's worldwide business operations, said the
joint venture would 'be the basis of a global generics business'.
He said that the six months since the stake was taken had showed there was a
need for 'dedicated manpower' to take Schein from its US base to other
countries.
Initially, 10 to 15 people would be employed by the joint venture including
specialists in the launch and marketing of drugs and in finding new
products.
Schein already has a portfolio of more than 400 products, and is especially
strong in central nervous system and heart drugs.
Mr Ebsworth said the company would make a priority of finding new
antibiotics to manufacture and sell.
The acquisition of the Schein stake marked Bayer's entry into generics. The
deal includes provision for the stake to be raised to 51 per cent 'over the
medium term', said Mr Ebsworth.
An increasing number of prescription drug companies is seeing generics as a
business with potential for rapid growth. Many drugs patented in the 1970s
are losing patent protection, opening up the market to companies such as
Schein.
At the same time, governments are encouraging more generics manufacturers in
the hope that increased competition will hold back prices.
Many other prescription drug companies have made a move into generics. Last
month, BASF, Bayer's German rival, diversified its pharmaceuticals division
Knoll into generics for the German market. The move was part of a strategy
developed after Knoll had reported its first loss, and it is now looking for
foreign partners.
Last year, Hoechst, the third of the big three German chemicals companies,
paid Dollars 546m for a 51 per cent stake in Copley Pharmaceuticals, another
US company, and in May this year, Bristol Myers Squibb bought 25 per cent of
Azupharma, a German generics manufacturer.

Renault share sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government has taken the first step in the partial privatisation
of Renault, saying it was launching the process to determine a group of
stable shareholders in the motor vehicle group.
The economy ministry said that from today , potential investors in the core
shareholding group, who will hold a combined 5 per cent of Renault's shares,
would be able to place their offers. The offer period will last for two
weeks.
Investors in the so-called group of shareholding partners will each have to
buy a minimum of 2.4m shares, about 1 per cent of the company's capital.
They will have to hold all the shares for three months and 80 per cent for
the following 21 months. The sale of the 80 per cent of the shares will,
however, be possible within the group of core shareholders.
Core shareholders are expected to include Renault's industrial partners,
such as Elf Aquitaine, the oil group, and Lagardere Group, the electronics
and communications concern. The share sale will take place after a FFr2bn
(Dollars 377m) capital increase.
Overall, the French government plans to reduce its holding in Renault from
80 per cent to just above 50 per cent. The majority of the issue is to go to
individuals and employees of the automobile group.

FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Thyssen Stahl to split units in
attempt to boost results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Thyssen Stahl, Germany's biggest steelmaker, yesterday said it was splitting
its long products and wire divisions into smaller companies. It said the aim
was to improve their reaction to market forces and start making profits
again.
The decision follows similar moves by Krupp Hoesch, Germany's second biggest
steel producer, which has hived off several divisions into independent
subsidiaries, some of which will become joint ventures with Thyssen.
Both steelmakers argue that the market behaves differently for many steel
products and that separate management is required if these areas are to
recover from recent heavy losses.
The companies emerging from these changes will also not be subject to
Montanmitbestimmung, a form of workers' co-determination in the German coal
and steel industry which has made it more difficult for loss-making steel
companies to make workers redundant.
Thyssen and Krupp Hoesch have said they will begin to reap the benefits of
restructuring in their steel divisions this year but both still expect
losses.
Three new companies dealing in long products will be created with sales of
about DM1.5bn (Dollars 970m), around 15 per cent of Thyssen Stahl's 1993
turnover. EWK Edelstahl is the largest of the three with around 2,600
employees.
The wire division, Thyssen Draht, with a turnover of around DM300m, will
also be split into three companies.

beer to China

<TEXT>
Molson, the Canadian brewing, retailing and speciality chemicals group,
confirmed it was entering the Chinese beer market with direct exports from
its Canadian breweries.
Molson Breweries, the brewing unit owned 40 per cent by Molson, 40 per cent
by Foster's of Australia and 20 per cent by Miller of the US, will start by
exporting Molson 'Ice' beer, a premium brand already selling successfully
throughout North America, the UK and Aus-tralia.
The distributor will be American Beverage.
Mr Marshall Cohen, Molson chairman, said: 'The move creates a beachhead for
us in the world's second-biggest beer market, now growing at 20 per cent a
year. We will be well positioned to take up further opportunities.'
Molson did not confirm speculation that it would participate in a joint
venture announced last June by Foster's and Wheelock of Hong Kong to build
breweries in China.
John Labatt, Molson's Canadian rival, has also been examining the Chinese
beer market. The group recently bought part of a Mexican brewer for CDollars
720m (USDollars 537.3m).
The Chinese market has proved extremely attractive to foreign brewery
companies. China boasts some 800, mostly tiny, breweries, but there are no
identifiable national brands with the possible exception of Tsingtao, which
has just 2.5 per cent of the market.
Since 1984 China has jumped from seventh place to second behind the US as a
beer producer with output in 1993 of 12.25m tonnes. The number of breweries
in that time has doubled. Mr John Smith, General Motors president, yesterday
announced the creation of a new post to oversee the company's operations in
China, AP reports from Paris.
Mr Rudolph Schlais will be based in Beijing as president of GM China
Operations, co-ordinating vehicle and component businesses, Mr Smith said.
'It's a huge, developing market and we've got to bring more resources into
it,' Mr Smith told journalists at the Paris Motor Show.

rating

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The senior long-term debt of Unibank, Denmark's second largest commercial
bank, has been upgraded by Moody's, the US credit rating agency, to A1 from
A2.
Unibank suffered three years of substantial losses from 1990 to 1992 but
returned to a net profit of DKr885m (Dollars 145.69m) in 1993.
In the first half of this year it made DKr207m after loss provisions had
been cut to DKr950m from DKr1.54bn a year earlier.
The first-half performance was marred, however, by unrealised losses on the
bond and share portfolio of DKr533m.
Moody's noted an improvement over the past few years in asset quality,
earnings and capital, as well as progress in reducing what the agency
described as the bank's 'historically high expense base'.
Unibank's recovery began when a new chief executive, Mr Thorleif Krarup, was
brought in 1992 and immediately implemented a new round of cost-cutting
measures.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Survey of The Principality of Liechtenstein (1): High
finance and independence - This diminutive country has never had it so good.
But its wealth is the source of its biggest problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tiny principality of Liechtenstein, wedged between Austria and
Switzerland in the upper Rhine valley, must rank as one of the earth's most
successful societies, writes Ian Rodger.
Prosperity is high, unemployment is virtually non existent, the economy is
well balanced between highly productive secondary and tertiary sectors and
modern social problems are almost unknown.
Indeed, the principality provides a case study of the economic virtuous
circle taken to an extreme. Low taxation has attracted ever more investment
in manufacturing industry and ever more business for Liechtenstein's
trustee-lawyers who set up tax avoiding schemes for the world's rich. And
their growth and productivity have prevented any need for tax increases for
a long time.
Individuals pay 8 to 10 per cent tax on their incomes, active companies 6 to
18 per cent on their profits.
Neighbouring countries may complain that the principality's low taxes
constitute an unfair competitive advantage, but the public sector is awash
with money and would not know what to do with more of it. The national
government has budget surpluses as a matter of course. The town of Vaduz,
the capital, makes more money from investing its financial reserves than it
does from taxes.
The key to this paradise-like state, apart from reasonably good management,
is Liechtenstein's Lilliputian size. With an area of only 160 square
kilometres and a population of only 30,000, it does not have to grapple with
the costs or complexities of big regional or income disparities. And the
demands placed upon it by the international community are modest.
The problems Liechtenstein faces are nearly unique - how to preserve its
blessed state in the face of increasing integration in Europe, how to
accommodate further economic expansion and how to prevent its democracy from
being corrupted by a small but super rich elite of trustee-lawyers, bankers
and industrialists.
The biggest problem facing all Liechtenstein industry and commerce is
manpower. The principality's economic structure has long since outgrown the
ability of the community to provide sufficient labour.
Foreigners now constitute nearly 40 per cent of the principality's 30,000
residents and, together with 6,500 commuters from Austria and Switzerland,
60 per cent of the 20,000 strong workforce.
Political leaders say that these proportions are excessively high, provoking
some disquiet among citizens. However, the statistics are not as stark as
they look.
Liechtenstein has a very mean policy towards immigrants, such that second
and third generation permanent residents can easily be prevented from
obtaining citizenship.
Mr Mario Frick, the prime minister, wants to change the law, and thereby to
reduce the immigrant population to a more tolerable 30 per cent.
Still, the difficulty in finding qualified labour together with high wage
rates have already driven many companies to set up factories in neighbouring
Austria and Switzerland, and that trend will undoubtedly continue.
As has occurred elsewhere, it looks as if Liechtenstein companies will try
to keep their higher value activities plus research and development at home.
Thus, growth prospects may be limited, but the principality will continue to
advance around the virtuous circle.
Liechtenstein has followed two strategies for securing its future
independence, both paradoxically aimed at avoiding isolation.
The first, championed by the reigning prince, Hans-Adam II, has been to join
international organisations, such as the United Nations, the European Free
Trade Association (Efta) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt).
The second has been to join the European Economic Area (EEA).
Liechtenstein's industries exported goods worth SFr2.5bn (SFr83,000 per
capita) in 1992, with more than half of them going to European Union
countries.
Thus, the principality could not be indifferent to the process of European
integration. It did not want to join the EU itself, partly because it feared
that EU financial directives would compromise its tax haven, but mainly
because it does not have the manpower to carry its share of the
administrative burden.
The EEA, an expanded free trade treaty negotiated three years ago by the
European Union and Efta countries, seemed to provide a middle way,
especially as the principality succeeded in negotiating an exception to the
freedom of movement of people requirement.
Industrial leaders have enthusiastically endorsed the EEA agreement, making
clear the consequences if Liechtensteiners do not approve it in a referendum
later this year.
'If we do not join the EEA, industry will run down its manufacturing
activities here,' says Willy Frommelt, director-general of the Liechtenstein
Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
However, there are mixed feelings among the leaders of the powerful
financial community, and the outcome of the referendum remains uncertain.
Even if it succeeds, the future of the EEA itself is in doubt.
If Finland, Sweden and Norway join Austria in entering the EU next year, the
only remaining members of the EEA would be Liechtenstein and Iceland.
The Liechtenstein government's hope is that the EEA can be given new life as
a halfway house for some eastern and southern European countries wanting to
join the EU.
Another advantage of EEA membership is that it would require companies and
financial institutions to adhere to EU regulations, thereby reducing their
local lobbying power.
Until now, political balance in this small and tightly knit community has
been maintained in no small measure thanks to the unique position and powers
of the reigning prince. The story is told that the only legislation ever
vetoed by the previous reigning prince, Franz-Josef II, was a measure to
limit hunting licences. He could see that it was a scheme put up by the
super rich who knew they could outbid ordinary citizens for all the
licences.
'The prince is very important. We have to have someone here who is
independent,' says Peter Ritter, himself one of the most successful
trustee-lawyers in Liechtenstein.
Yet relations between the prince, the government, the parliament and the
people are unusually tense these days. Two years ago, Hans-Adam II startled
his subjects by threatening to dissolve parliament if it did not endorse his
demand for a referendum on the EEA in advance of one in Switzerland. Last
year, he had another confrontation with parliament. When it threw out Markus
Buchel as prime minister, the prince dissolved parliament rather than let
the 25 members name someone else as they wished.
The prince, who insists that neither he nor a majority of the people would
be satisfied with his having only a ceremonial role, has proposed
constitutional changes to clarify everyone's roles. But it has been agreed
to postpone discussion of them until after the EEA question and a clutch of
niggling bilateral problems with Switzerland have been resolved.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Survey of The Principality of Liechtenstein (3): First UK
ministerial visit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID DAVIS, UK minister of state at the Foreign Office, this morning
becomes the first British minister ever to make an official visit to
Liechtenstein.
Mr Davis, who has responsibility for European matters, said in an interview
that he was looking forward to discussing European institutions and the
handling of organised crime with the reigning prince, Hans-Adam II, the
prime minister and the foreign minister.
As a tax haven, Liechtenstein has been remarkably successful in keeping
criminals away, but it attracted considerable attention two years ago when
it emerged that Mr Robert Maxwell, the collapsed media tycoon, based some of
his activities in the principality.
Mr Davis said Liechtenstein officials had been very helpful in the Maxwell
case, and he wanted to build on the co-operation established. 'We do not
want any boltholes for financial criminals,' he said.
Britain also welcomed Liechtenstein's proposed membership of the European
Economic Area (EEA), the expanded free trade area negotiated between
countries of the European Union and the European Free Trade Association
(Efta).

ruler joins the fray / Interview of Prince Hans-Adam II
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are testing times for His Serene Highness Hans-Adam II, reigning
prince of Liechtenstein since 1989 and the last monarch in Europe with any
real power.
The prince triggered a constitutional crisis two years ago by a rare
exercise of that power, threatening to dissolve parliament if it did not
endorse his demand that a referendum on joining the European Economic Area
(EEA) be held in advance of one in Switzerland on the same issue.
In the end, a compromise was worked out, with the prince withdrawing his
threat and the government agreeing to promote the EEA cause in the
referendum campaign.
While the constitution clearly states that the reigning prince has
responsibility for foreign affairs, Prince Hans-Adam was really making a
more general point.
His father, Prince Franz Josef II, who led the formerly poor agricultural
principality to undreamed of prosperity in the post war period, had
gradually implicitly ceded some princely powers to the parliament and
government.
The new prince wanted to claw back some of them, making clear in a famous
statement during the constitutional crisis that he wanted to be an active
monarch. 'If they want someone who will just do representational work, they
must look for someone else,' he said.
Today, the 49 year old Hans-Adam remains pleased with the outcome of the
crisis. Not only did a majority of Liechtensteiners endorse his
recommendation to join the EEA, but popular sentiment in favour of an active
monarchy was confirmed.
'There is no majority for a figurehead,' he said in an interview in his
palace office above Vaduz, a view fully endorsed in interviews with several
other Liechtensteiners.
However, neither the EEA nor the constitutional issue is yet definitively
resolved. Three months ago, the prince made a series of constitutional
amendment proposals, mainly to adjust the division of powers and to
incorporate a formula enabling the people to oust a disliked prince.
The proposals aroused considerable controversy. 'We are still discussing
them,' the prince said with a smile. 'But we all agree that we should not
push for a solution before we have resolved the EEA question.'
Liechtenstein's entry into the EEA has been delayed by the need to work out
a system for preserving its customs union with Switzerland, which decided
not to join. The prince said arrangements had been agreed among officials
and documents were 'ready for signing'.
The government has agreed to hold another referendum on the final terms,
giving the people another opportunity to endorse or reject entry. The prince
said he was 'fairly confident' that the result would be positive again.
He believes fervently that the principality's future security and
independence depend on closer ties with the rest of Europe. 'If we can
progress in this way, with the economy integrated with the EEA, we will be
in a much better position than in the past. It also has economic
implications - in terms of the inflow of money and exports of industrial
goods.'
On the other hand, he does not want Liechtenstein to join the European
Union. 'The main problem is that we are too small. We would have to open our
borders to people and we would have an inflow of thousands of rich people.
We could only control it by raising income tax, and our people would not
accept that.'
He also acknowledges that the principality's main international relationship
for the foreseeable future will remain with Switzerland, even if Switzerland
remains outside the EEA and EU.
The prince is known as a deeply conservative and devout Catholic and his
constitutional initiatives might suggest that he was a diehard
traditionalist. But he has also worked vigorously in recent years to update
the ancient princely family code (Hausgesetz).
'My father thought we should adapt it to the modern world. He started
working on it in the 1960s, and I finally got the family's agreement on it
last year.'
The new code sets out clear criteria for defining who are family members -
there are now nearly 120 - and prevents them from exploiting the name for
commercial gain. Offenders can have their titles removed.
The code also provides for a process for the family to remove a reigning
prince if he is not behaving responsibly. Only the nearly 50 males over 18
are allowed to vote. Hans-Adam regrets that his attempt to give women the
vote was rejected.
He has also been trying to recover the family's immense property holdings in
what is now the Czech republic. In all, the family claims 1,600 square
kilometres of mostly forested land there, about 10 times the area of the
principality itself.
After the second world war, Czechoslovakia classified Liechtenstein with
Germany as a country from which no demands for recovery of confiscated
assets would be accepted even though the principality was neutral during the
war.
The Czech republic has signed treaties that oblige it to treat Liechtenstein
as it treats other countries. But it fears that if it gave way to
Liechtenstein, it would also have huge claims from former Sudeten Germans.
'We understand that it is a touchy problem for them,' the prince says.
'There is not much we can do.'
Talk has begun in Liechtenstein about the prince's possible retirement. This
has become something of a tradition in the family.
'My father retired, and his predecessor too. I will try to turn over the job
at the appropriate date. My eldest son is 26. He still has some training to
do.'

FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: US hospital groups in Dollars
3.4bn merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Columbia/HCA Healthcare, the biggest hospitals group in the US, is to
acquire HealthTrust, owner of the country's second-largest hospital chain,
in an all-stock deal valued yesterday at about Dollars 3.4bn. It will assume
Dollars 1.8bn of HealthTrust's debt.
This is the third multi-billion dollar hospital takeover by Columbia in 18
months. It transforms Columbia from a small company with only 20 facilities
to one with Dollars 15bn in turnover and 311 hospitals.
The transaction represents the first big takeover in the US healthcare
industry since the failure last month of the Clinton administration's
proposed healthcare reform legislation, and points to the consolidation of
the industry regardless of political considerations.
Both companies said the deal had been prompted by a need to reduce costs and
improve services for the managed care organisations who are among the
biggest buyers of healthcare in the US. 'This will give us even a greater
opportunity to make sure we are affordable,' said Mr Richard Scott, the
former financier and Columbia/HCA chief executive who has masterminded the
company's recent deals.
HealthTrust's board picked Columbia/HCA's offer out of a number that were
presented at a board meeting on Tuesday, said Mr Clayton McWhorter, chairman
of HealthTrust. Among the offers is believed to have been one from National
Medical Enterprises, which had been trying to engineer a three-way merger to
create a healthcare group to rival Columbia/HCA.
Under the deal announced yesterday, Mr McWhorter will become chairman of
Columbia/HCA. Mr Thomas Frist will step down as chairman to become a
vice-chairman.
Although Columbia/HCA would account for more than a quarter of the hospitals
owned by for-profit companies, as opposed to not-for profit organisations,
the company claimed the takeover would not harm competition in the hospitals
market. For-profit companies accounted for 14 per cent of all hospitals in
the US, Mr Scott said.
Adding HealthTrust's 116 hospitals to the 195 owned by Columbia/HCA would
lead to little overlap, since the smaller company operated facilities mainly
in rural areas, the companies said. Its network is intended in part as a
feeder system for Columbia/HCA's network in urban areas. The only area where
the merger was likely to prompt anti-trust concerns was in Salt Lake City,
Mr Scott said.
The two companies said the merger would produce annual savings of Dollars
125m. Much of this would come from combining purchasing operations, giving
total purchases of Dollars 2.5bn of medical equipment and supplies a year
and adding to their ability to negotiate lower prices. Further savings would
come from eliminating duplication of functions.
The deal is unlikely to mark an end to Columbia/HCA's expansion, although
there remain few healthcare companies as big as HealthTrust for it to buy.
Fears that yesterday's all-stock deal would dilute the company's earnings
per share wiped 5 per cent off Columbia/HCA's shares share price pushing it
Dollars 2 1/8 lower to close at Dollars 40 5/8 . Shares in HealthTrust
jumped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 34 1/4.

FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Carolco Pictures on brink of
collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Carolco Pictures, the independent Hollywood film studio which has teetered
on the brink of financial collapse for several years in spite of producing
box-office hits such as Cliffhanger and Terminator 2, warned yesterday that
its immediate survival was in doubt because of severe liquidity problems.
The debt-laden studio, which agreed earlier this year to merge with Live
Entertainment, the video and music retailer, in an effort to stave off
insolvency, said it had been forced to use its current cash balances to fund
the continued production of two films - Showgirls and Cut-Throat Island.
Carolco said problems in casting and production for the two films would
delay the availability of production loans needed to complete the films
until later in the fourth quarter.
In an attempt to solve the short-term financial crisis and continue with the
production of at least one of the films, Carolco said it was negotiating to
transfer its rights to Showgirls to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, another troubled
Hollywood studio. MGM last year was part of a group of investors which
pumped Dollars 112.5m into Carolco to keep it afloat.
Carolco said it had negotiated an agreement with RCS Video Services
International, an Italian company which is due to buy Carolco debt in
December. This would allow the Hollywood studio to borrow against the
anticipated proceeds of the sale of that debt, and secured prepayments of
various funds from Pioneer of Japan and Le Studio Canal of France related to
the licensing and sale of Carolco films.
The studio said the proceeds from these agreements should total about
Dollars 20m, which would allow it to continue with the production of
Cut-Throat Island. However, if the agreements - which are subject to the
approval of the various companies' boards - break down, Carolco said it may
not be able to continue operating.

Orkla, the Norwegian group with interests ranging from branded consumer
goods to chemical processing, yesterday announced an improvement in
eight-month pre-tax profits and the acquisition of the fine chemicals
activities of EniChem of Italy for an undisclosed amount.
Group pre-tax profits rose to NKr977m (Dollars 138m) from NKr907m of which
NKr274m was derived from the investment division, against NKr202m in the
same period last year.
Group sales advanced to NKr13.66bn from NKr11.28bn as operating profit
increased to NKr918m from NKr852m, helped mainly by good progress in Orkla's
chemicals business which lifted operating profit 62 per cent to NKr203m.
Orkla's industrial activities, in which chemicals is grouped, lifted
operating profit to NKr897m from NKr835m. Branded consumer goods, part of
Orkla's industrial activities, saw operating profit little changed at
NKr657m against NKr659m last year.

FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Spain opens way for foreign
stakes in Telefonica unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jose Borrell, Spain's transport and telecommunications minister, said
yesterday there were no obstacles to foreign companies taking equity stakes
in Telefonica's profitable international subsidiary. He also indicated the
government might sell some of its equity to allow the entry of new partners.
However, the subsidiary, Telefonica Internacional (Tisa), believes it would
be preferable for the unit to issue equity in order to finance its continued
expansion in Latin America, where it is the dominant foreign operator.
Tisa said it was in discussions with GTE, a US operator which has obtained
licences in Latin America, and that the two companies were conducting the
due diligence of their respective businesses in the continent.
An agreement with GTE to develop jointly the fast growing Latin America
market could be 'weeks or months away', Tisa said, though it added that
'ideally there should be an agreement before the end of the year'. The
negotiations have been slowed by the varying forms of equity holdings,
management agreements and consortium arrangements that the two companies
have in Latin America.
'We are looking for the complementary nature of the businesses and there are
a lot of complexities to iron out,' the group said.
Tisa is also conducting a review of its Latin American operations with a
view to gaining economies of scale and access to information superhighway
technology. It is trying to shape its different units, which include basic
telephony, cellular, cable-TV, data-transmission and yellow page licences,
into a more cohesive corporate mould.
Tisa, which has stakes in 20 Latin American companies and has a market
capitalisation of between Dollars 6bn-Dollars 7bn, raised its first-half
profits this year by 80 per cent to Dollars 88.9m. It is investing about
Dollars 600m a year in Latin America and it is preparing to bid for
telecommunications privatisations in Bolivia and Nicaragua.
Mr Borrell said 'there was no problem' over an alliance between Tisa and a
foreign operator, and that a sale of government equity was a possibility.
The Spanish government's portfolio holds a 23.8 per cent stake in Tisa.
Telefonica, which is 32 per cent owned by the government portfolio, owns the
rest of Tisa equity.
Tisa is discussing partnership alliances with AT&amp;T, the US long-distance
operator, but it said these were at a more preliminary stage.

FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Swiss investors warm to
Sudelektra - The group's shares have soared in the past year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It took Swiss investors a while to get to like Sudelektra, the industrial
holding company controlled by Glencore International, formerly Marc Rich &amp;
Co.
But in the past nine months, they have made the company one of Switzerland's
best performing stocks. Sudelektra shares, which were split two-for-one on
Monday, have soared to SFr895 from SFr370 at the end of last year.
The main attraction, apart from a sharp improvement in recent earnings, is
the potential for synergy between Glencore and Sudelektra.
Glencore is primarily a commodity trader, but since 1985 it has invested
more in the production of the raw materials and commodities it sells. Now it
has decided that any further industrial assets it takes on will be put into
Sudelektra.
Mr Willy Strothotte, chairman of both companies, says the ownership of
commodity production can be an advantage to a trader. 'It elevates you to a
different level of co-operation with your trade partners,' he says.
He cites the example of stainless steelmakers, who need a reliable supply of
ferrochrome. They are more likely to establish a long-term contractual
relationship with a trader that has some captive capacity, he argues.
For Sudelektra, which has just taken over a South African chrome mine and
ferrochrome smelter from Glencore, being associated with one of the world's
best commodity marketers should yield considerable benefits.
For one thing, it enables the mine and plant managers to concentrate solely
on production. Glencore traders assure the supply of raw materials they need
and the sales of the output.
And, since Glencore looks for long-term sales contracts, Sudelektra should
be a less volatile performer than other producers. 'We try for a steady
return rather than to pick the top of the cycle,' Mr Strothotte says.
Finally, Glencore's worldwide market presence and industrial intelligence
helps Sudelektra to spot potential acquisitions.
All this is a long way from Sudelektra's beginnings in 1926 when it was set
up by Swiss investors to finance infrastructure projects in South America.
After the second world war, electric power projects in Peru and Argentina in
which it was involved were nationalised, converting the company perforce
into an investment fund.
Marc Rich bought a 53 per cent stake from Union Bank of Switzerland in 1990,
saying it would turn Sudelektra into an industrial holding company.
Investors were either unimpressed or took little notice, because the shares
scarcely reacted to this change of control and direction. Nor did they move
after the company announced its first large industrial investment - a 35 per
cent stake in the Santa Cruz petroleum and natural gas project in Argentina
for Dollars 27m in December 1991.
A year later, Mr Marc Rich revealed that the property was producing 5,000
barrels of oil and 30m cubic feet of gas a day from 50 wells. Sudelektra had
recovered over a fifth of its investment, he said, and potential reserves
were much larger than initially anticipated.
Still the shares remained in the doldrums.
In fairness, net income in the year to 30 April 1993 at SFr17.4m (Dollars
13.5m) was not much higher than the SFr14.8m recorded two years earlier. The
balance sheet had doubled to SFr187.9m, but much of that was due to the
publication of consolidated figures and the realisation of capital gains, as
well as the Santa Cruz cash flow.
Then in November of last year, the group forecast that it would report a
marked increase in profits in the year to April 1994. By the time it
revealed in early June that its 1993-94 net income was over SFr28m, a 65 per
cent advance, the shares were trading at SFr1,320.
It launched a two-for-one rights issue at SFr1,000 to raise SFr150m to
finance the purchase of two industrial properties developed by Glencore.
One, Chromecorp Technology, operates a South African chrome smelter with its
own mine and the other, Forestal del Sur in Chile, produces wood chips.
Mr Strothotte says Sudelektra will only invest in producing commodities that
Glencore trades, and that the scale of its production will be well within
Glencore's trading volumes.
He points out that Sudelektra is debt-free, has Dollars 100m in liquid funds
in its war chest and further authorised capital of SFr170m.

FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Avesta Sheffield expands in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Avesta Sheffield is planning to expand its presence in the US market through
the purchase of the assets of Eastern Stainless from Armco, one of the
leading US steel groups.
The Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer said the deal came at a time of
rising US demand and increasing prices. And it comes just three weeks after
British Steel increased its stake in Avesta Sheffield to 49.9 per cent from
40 per cent.
Buying Eastern will increase Avesta's US stainless plate sales to SKr900m
(Dollars 120.3m) from SKr500m a year, while lifting its plate capacity there
to 60,000 tonnes a year from 35,000 tonnes. The company operates a stainless
plate plant in New Castle, Indiana, and has a welded tube factory in
Wildwood, Florida.
Eastern turns over Dollars 65m a year but has made heavy losses for several
years. Avesta plans to restructure the operation to return it to profit by
1996. It pointed to potential synergies with its New Castle unit.
The acquisition includes a plate plant, a mothballed melting shop, and an
annealing and pickling line. Avesta said it had no immediate plans to
reactivate the melting shop. The parties hope to finalise the deal by the
end of the year.
North America is Avesta's third biggest market, after the UK and the Nordic
region, and accounts for 25 per cent of group sales.
Mr Adri De Ridder, strategic planning officer, said it would be easier to
increase volumes in the US than in the intensely competitive European
market. 'US per-capita consumption of stainless is significantly lower than
in Europe,' he said.

FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: British Thornton shares take 32% tumble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HEATHER DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in British Thornton Holdings, the packaging and specialist furniture
group, tumbled 24p to 51p, a 32 per cent drop, following a warning that
pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31 were likely to be
'significantly below market expectations'.
Analysts said the company was not on track to achieve the estimated Pounds
2.6m year-end figure. For the first half of 1993-94 pre-tax profits were
Pounds 1.15m, with Pounds 2.11m for the year to April 30.
Volumes in the video games industry, particularly in the UK, had not
recovered as expected, said Mr Brian North, chairman. The group's
subsidiaries, Masterform and Masterpack, which make packaging and display
materials, relied heavily on the industry.
Mr North said video games sales were weighted towards the pre-Christmas
shopping season and so it was difficult to predict the extent of any
recovery in the second half.
However, the company 'remained confident' of the market's long-term
potential. It was seeking to develop closer links with Sega with a view to
producing packaging and displays for a broader range of its products.
The group is committed to expanding its non-Sega business and has won some
new accounts, including Polygram.

FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Finelist advances to Pounds 2.45m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Finelist, the car parts distributor, beat its flotation forecast with a leap
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.01m to Pounds 2.45m in the year to June 30.
The shares firmed 1p to 146p yesterday, against a 130p flotation price in
February.
Mr Chris Swan, chairman and chief executive, said the pre-tax figure was
Pounds 150,000 ahead of forecast.
Turnover was up 50 per cent to Pounds 24.1m (Pounds 16.1m) and operating
margins rose from 7.5 to 10.6 per cent. Mr Swan ascribed this advance to
volume growth, price increases, reductions in branch costs and overheads,
and some benefit from acquisitions. The group added nine more sites, with
four opening since the float.
Since the period-end, Finelist, which trades principally under the Autela
name, has bought Edmunds Walker and its Walter Moss/Berite subsidiary for up
to Pounds 20m, funded in part by a 1-for-2 rights issue at 120p to raise
Pounds 12m.
EW, which has been loss-making, brings with it 89 sites and sales of Pounds
64m. WMB, which is to be integrated into the Autela chain, brings 10 sites
and sales of Pounds 4m.
Mr Swan said that, like Finelist which left the own-label parts market two
years ago, EW sold only branded parts. It is strong in commercial vehicle
and engine parts. The combined group now has 177 outlets, of which 23 are
franchises. Mr Swan said he wanted the group to have about 250 outlets
within the next three years.
In the present year trading in the original group was in line with budget,
the company said, while the first six weeks from EW was well ahead.
Interest payable fell to Pounds 98,000 (Pounds 191,000). At the end of
August, the group had net assets of Pounds 15.5m, a Pounds 10m term loan (to
help pay for EW), and cash of Pounds 5.5m. This gives gearing of about 32
per cent.
Earnings jumped to 8.2p (3p) per share and the proposed single final
dividend is 1.5p, as forecast.

FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: FG Wilson set for takeover by US group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FG Wilson (Engineering), Europe's largest manufacturer of diesel generator
sets, confirmed yesterday it had reached a preliminary agreement to be
acquired by St Louis-based Emerson Electric.
The privately owned Larne-based company, one of Northern Ireland's biggest
private sector employers, would not disclose a price for the takeover. But
it is believed that Emerson will pay between Pounds 150m and Pounds 200m.
The takeover, if it goes ahead, would be one of the biggest investments by a
foreign company in Northern Ireland. It comes in the wake of the IRA's
ceasefire announcement at the end of August, which has raised the confidence
of overseas investors in the province.
Mr Tom Wilson, managing director of FG Wilson, said talks were at a
preliminary stage, but directors believed a partnership with Emerson would
lead to considerable benefits for the company and its employees.
FG Wilson already deals with several Emerson divisions in switchgear,
electronic controls and generators. Mr Wilson said an alliance would enable
the Ulster company to broaden its penetration of international markets
through Emerson's worldwide distribution networks.
Directors also believed the partnership would lead to expansion of FG
Wilson's production facilities and to further job opportunities at its Larne
site. The company employs about 1,000 people.
FG Wilson had sales of Pounds 165m in the year to August. Profit figures
were not available, but in 1992-93 it made about Pounds 18m.
The company was formed in 1966, and exports some 80 to 90 per cent of its
sales, mainly to continental Europe, Australasia and the Middle East. A
link-up with Emerson could help sales in North and South America.
Emerson makes a broad range of electrical and electronic products and had
sales of Dollars 8.2bn (Pounds 5.2bn) last year.

FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Computer People to buy VNG for Pounds 7m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Computer People Group is proposing to acquire VNG Group, the computing
services and consultancy company. The offer, which values VNG at Pounds 7m,
is being made on the basis of 1.025 shares for each VNG share, or a cash
alternative of 186.5p per share.
To fund the acquisition, Computer People has announced a placing and open
offer of 3.07m new ordinary shares at 182p each, to raise Pounds 5m net of
expenses. Up to Pounds 1.8m will be used to fund the cash consideration and
Pounds 3.2m to refinance VNG's debt arrangements.
The move follows the acquisition of Span last July for Pounds 5.5m when
Pounds 5.8m was raised through a placing and open offer.
Irrevocable undertakings to accept in respect of 91.9 per cent of VNG's
shares have been received.
The placing has been underwritten by NatWest Securities. The open offer is
on a 1-for-6 basis.
VNG, founded in 1979, reported operating losses in 1993 but returned to
profit in the first half of 1994. The group comprises contracting arms in
the UK and Europe, a UK-based training division, which had an interim
turnover of Pounds 395,000, and a UK consulting business, which had an
interim turnover of Pounds 593,000.

FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Trafficmaster in high street link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafficmaster yesterday announced that it had reached an agreement with high
street retailers which would result in its traffic monitoring system being
sold through more than 500 outlets by early next year
When it gained a listing in March, the company had sold about 2,100 units
through direct marketing, but it expects substantial growth through access
to retail networks, mainly electronics and cellular phone stores.
Trafficmaster also reported that interim pre-tax losses had risen from
Pounds 468,000 to Pounds 541,000 on turnover up 61 per cent to Pounds
571,000. This reflected increased investment in infrastructure.
Trafficmaster will have completed coverage of the 912 miles of motorways
detailed in its listing particulars, by December 7, when it will launch its
national network.
It will also have installed sensors covering 406 miles of trunk roads by the
end of the year.
Mr David Martell, chief executive, said the company was focusing on building
up infrastructure, rather than short-term profits.
It had spent Pounds 1.5m on developing its network since the flotation,
which raised Pounds 7.17m, and yesterday it opened its National Traffic Data
Centre.
It is also negotiating with car manufacturers over usage of Trafficmaster in
an on-board system for new cars. Mr Martell reckons that such a system will
be introduced by at least two manufacturers by the end of 1996.
At the end of June, cash and short-term deposits were Pounds 7m, which Mr
Mantell said would be sufficient to fund its investment programme.
The share price closed down 1p at 180p. But it has been one of the best
performing flotations of the year, rising from an issue price of 130p.
The company is not paying a dividend, as flagged at the time of flotation.
Losses per share fell from 3.6p to 2.9p.

FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Unipart expands to Pounds 13.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rapidly expanding motor component manufacturing activities helped Unipart,
the motor parts and accessories group once owned by Rover Group, achieve an
increase in first half pre-tax profits from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 13.3m.
Mr John Neill the chief executive, reported the figures to July 2 from
turnover 14 per cent higher at Pounds 401m (Pounds 353m).
The figures were accompanied by the disclosure that a recently-formed joint
venture with Air International Group of Australia to produce vehicle
air-conditioning systems has started its first development work, for General
Motors' Opel car making subsidiary.
Unipart DCM, the group's parts distribution division, has also just won the
contract to take over all parts distribution in France for luxury car maker
Jaguar.
Mr Neill added that he did not expect this year's second half 'to be any
worse' than the first.
There were 'mixed signals' about demand, so Unipart would continue to focus
on reducing costs.

FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Murray raises offer for Andrews Sykes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Murray has increased his offer for Andrews Sykes, the industrial
services group of which he is chairman, valuing the company at Pounds 10.7m,
against Pounds 8.24m previously.
European Fire Protection Holdings, the private Netherlands-based company
owned by Mr Murray, has increased its offer for the ordinary shares from 50p
to 65p and from 12p to 15.6p for the preference shares.
The move follows European Fire's latest purchase in the market of a 5.5 per
cent stake at 65p a share, taking its total holding, including those acting
in concert, to 47.65 per cent.
In addition, acceptances have been received in respect of 39,942 shares, or
0.28 per cent.
European Fire also holds 8.33 per cent of the preference shares.
The shares were unchanged yesterday at 67p.
The bid is the culmination of Mr Murray's taking control of Andrews Sykes,
which began in May when he and four of his supporters won control of the
board at an extraordinary general meeting. In July he replaced Mr David
Hubbard as chairman.
Andrews Sykes is in the middle of a reorganisation to refocus on its core
activities of pumping, heating, air conditioning and hire businesses.

FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Decline to Pounds 1.3m at Novo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The poor performance of its film entertainment services division and a loss
on the disposal of its French associate were behind a reduction in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 1.81m to Pounds 1.29m at Novo Group in the year ended
March 31.
Sales rose 19 per cent to Pounds 17.1m (Pounds 14.3m).
The group is involved in litigation concerning Walport International, which
was acquired from BET, concerning certain alleged licensing and copyright
irregularities.
Lower operating profits of Pounds 1.85m (Pounds 2.31m) reflected a Pounds
241,000 charge related to the litigation. In addition, a loss of Pounds
182,000 was incurred on the French disposal.
A reduced final dividend of 0.1p (1p) is recommended, making 0.2p (1.3p) for
the year. Earnings per share fell to 1.74p (3.82p).
The group is also raising Pounds 1.8m net as working capital via a 1-for-6
fully underwritten rights issue of 7.75m ordinary shares at 26p each.

FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Grampian forced to lower sights - Cost
benefits from restructuring have not yet made an impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grampian Holdings, the Scottish mini-conglomerate, disappointed analysts
yesterday by failing to deliver any meaningful fruits from last year's
intensive restructuring.
Pre-tax profits rose 75 per cent to Pounds 3.59m (Pounds 2.05m) for the
half-year to July 1; however, the 1993 figures were depressed by a Pounds
1.22m exceptional loss from reorganisation costs. The shares fell 12p to
117p, as analysts' forecasts were cut by around Pounds 2m.
Mr Bill Hughes, chairman and chief executive, admitted that Grampian
over-estimated the speed with which cost benefits would come through from
the consolidation of its pharmaceuticals business into one core
manufacturing centre.
Mr Hughes said: 'Overall, we expect cost savings of Pounds 500,000 for the
full year.' Grampian estimates the division could achieve Pounds 1.25m of
savings per year by 1995.
The UK pharmaceuticals division experienced a 7 per cent fall in sales, with
margins falling because of fierce competition in the supply of intensive
farming products. However, overseas markets, particularly Germany and New
Zealand, strengthened. The division's profits fell from Pounds 3.29m to
Pounds 3.04m. Sporting goods reduced losses from Pounds 273,000 to Pounds
183,000 but the company has yet to benefit from royalty income from a new
licensing agreement at Patrick International.
Transport performed well, benefiting from moves into higher-margin logistics
operations. Profits grew from Pounds 1.32m to Pounds 1.55m. Retail
operations now comprise a 25 per cent stake in Edinburgh Woollen Mill, which
contributed a Pounds 181,000 loss against a Pounds 475,000 divisional loss
in 1993.
Group turnover from continuing operations fell from Pounds 58.6m to Pounds
56.3m. Net debt fell by around Pounds 3m to Pounds 38m. Mr Hughes expects
year-end gearing of 60 per cent (74 per cent), reflected in lower interest
costs of Pounds 1.28m (Pounds 1.89m).
The dividend is maintained at 1.7p against an increase in earnings per share
from 2.14p to 3.68p.
COMMENT
For a long time Grampian's full earnings recovery has been somewhere over
the rainbow, and the market appears to be running out of patience.
Management is now maintaining a cautious note and analysts are forecasting
profits of Pounds 9m to Pounds 9.5m against prior forecasts of Pounds 11m.
This leaves the shares on a p/e of 12.4, with all the hopes of recovery to
come. Grampian operates something of a ragbag of small businesses with
little strategic logic, but the current price offers value.

BZW Endowment Fund, the trust which invests in second-hand with-profits
endowment policies, had a net asset value per share of 98.3p at July 31.
The company, which came to the market in October 1993, said policies had
been bought on better terms than had been envisaged at the trust's launch.
The fund held 856 policies with a value of some Pounds 10.9m and was about
60 per cent through its purchase programme, the directors said.
For the period from September 17 1993 to July 31 1994 there was a net
deficit of Pounds 1.2m, or losses per share of 5.99p.
At September 30 net asset value was 100.8p.

FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Prestwick on recovery path
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prestwick Holdings, the Scottish printed circuit board maker, returned to
profit at the operating level in the year to August 1 as measures to revive
it after heavy losses following ill-judged acquisitions took effect. Its
pre-tax loss was also sharply reduced.
Operating profit on continuing operations was Pounds 815,000 compared with a
restated deficit of Pounds 875,000. Losses on discontinued operations fell
to Pounds 141,000 from Pounds 950,000.
At the pre-tax level losses were cut to Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 3.97m) after
exceptional reorganisation costs of Pounds 493,000 (Pounds 478,000).
Turnover on continuing operations inched ahead to Pounds 32.9m, against
Pounds 32.4m, and the interest charge was reduced to Pounds 562,000 (Pounds
652,000). Losses per share emerged at 7.11p (20.34p).
Mr Archie Coulson, a company rescue specialist who became executive chairman
at the request of institutional shareholders in January, said the company
had achieved the forecasts made in August when it launched a Pounds 4.5m
rights issue.
Prestwick also sold Electroconnect, its electronic design subsidiary, to
management for Pounds 1.65m.
The company has no distributable reserves and is thus unable to pay
dividends. It intends to apply to the High Court to eliminate the deficit on
its distributable reserves and resume dividend payments when it is prudent
to do so.
Mr Coulson said the refinancing had given the company the flexibility to
choose between raising profit margins or going for volume growth.
It had to increase productivity, improve its processes and invest to improve
the quality of its capital equipment. Parts of its business were doing well
but others were not performing satisfactorily.

FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Storehouse upbeat and plans BHS expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Storehouse is stepping up the expansion of its BHS clothing chain, including
extending its franchise network in Spain, Greece and the Middle East.
The news came as the retail group, which also includes the Mothercare and
Blazer chains, said sales were running 7 per cent ahead of last year, and it
expected interim profits from retail operations to be 'comfortably ahead' of
last year.
Storehouse was upbeat on prospects for trading and growth. Its shares rose
1p to 198p.
It said that while sales for the first quarter to July were 5 per cent ahead
of last year, the increase for the first half was expected to be 7 per cent,
thanks partly to a strong back to school period.
Gross margins were being maintained, in spite of increased mark-downs to
clear excess stocks of children's clothing at Mothercare.
Cost increases were better than budget, although the group said
refurbishment of Mothercare stores would lead to higher operating costs and
depreciation charges.
BHS is accelerating its expansion programme and will increase selling space
by 5 per cent this year, and 8 per cent next year. Capital spending will
increase from Pounds 46m to Pounds 80m.
It is opening three stores during the autumn in Rochdale, Telford and
Stirling, and extending other stores. Six openings are scheduled for next
year. The group plans six openings in each of the following two years.
Some 13 BHS franchises will open this autumn in Spain Greece, Portugal and
the Middle East, where they will add to existing operations in Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Abu Dhabi.
Refurbishment of the Mothercare chain is continuing, with 42 stores,
representing a quarter of trading space, now completed.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SPAIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British Petroleum yesterday warned that refining margins were likely to
remain under pressure for the rest of the year, in spite of a return to
economic growth in much of Europe.
Mr Rolf Stomberg, chief executive of BP Oil Europe, said that European
refining margins were 'the lowest in five years.' The margin in the first
half of 1994 fell to Dollars 2.03 a barrel, against Dollars 2.48 in 1993.
Mr Stomberg told journalists visiting the company's Spanish refinery that
the gap between European supply and demand for refined products, such as
petrol, would 'narrow a bit next year.'
But he was not optimistic about a big improvement, because growth in
refinery capacity in Europe continued to outstrip demand. In addition low
international freight rates had allowed refiners throughout the world to
ship products to Europe.
BP had been able to offset deteriorating margins by improved earnings from
marketing activities, Mr Stomberg said.
Cost cutting and improvements to BP's five European refineries resulted in
fixed cost savings of Dollars 100m (Pounds 63.2m) in the first half, with
further improvements likely.

Airtours' travel retail chain.
Consideration will be in cash and unsecured loan notes. The initial payment
will be Pounds 2.4m with a further sum of up to Pounds 4m profit related.

FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 543,000 Dutch buy for Walker
Greenbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Walker Greenbank, the wallcoverings and fabrics group, entered a new phase
of international expansion with the acquisition of a Dutch distributor,
announced yesterday alongside its interim results.
The Pounds 543,000 purchase of Topwand forms part of Walker Greenbank's
strategy to boost overseas sales from 28 to 70 per cent of overall turnover
within the next five years.
In the six months to July 31 pre-tax profits were up 23 per cent from Pounds
3.35m to Pounds 4.14m. Group turnover rose 22 per cent from Pounds 29.9m to
Pounds 36.3m, partly thanks to a Pounds 2.05m contribution from two
companies, Hartley and Afia, acquired last year.
Mr Charles Wightman, chief executive, promised another acquisition to
strengthen the group's European distribution network by the end of this
year.
Walker Greenbank expects to double Topwand's pre-tax profits of Pounds
98,000 last year by expanding its salesforce to distribute more consumer
products in the Netherlands.
Interest costs fell from Pounds 181,000 to Pounds 39,000 and gearing was cut
from 10 per cent to 7 per cent.
This year the group expects to offset a 5 per cent increase in raw material
prices by higher plant utilisation and increased productivity. Sales price
increases next year are anticipated at 3 per cent.
Turnover in the non-core area of healthcare rose to Pounds 1.23m (Pounds
908,000). The group is planning to double the size of its healthcare
business , which produces bath lifts for the disabled, before disposal.
The healthcare company, Hampshire Medical, survived the group's
reorganisation after attempts to build Walker Greenbank into an industrial
conglomerate in the 1980s.
In 1991, Mr Wightman helped fight off a boardroom takeover by Aubin, a
Jersey-based investment company.
Earnings per share improved to 2.95p (2.44p) and the interim dividend is
increased to 1.3p (1.2p).

FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Austin Reed doubles to Pounds 1.84m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Austin Reed, the clothing group, doubled pre-tax profits from a restated
Pounds 930,000 to Pounds 1.84m in the 28 weeks to August 13 on the back of
maintained income from licensing and more than trebled profits from the
retail operations.
Turnover grew 12 per cent to Pounds 34.5m (Pounds 30.7m). Mr Chris Thomson,
finance director, said the results had beaten many expectations, adding that
the current strategy - in place for 18 months - had borne fruit for the past
three seasons.
He said that the heavily researched 'revitalising' of the product range was
targeting customers better and had broadened the customer base. That,
combined with the use of different retail formats for different locations
and clientele, was helping the group lose its slightly outmoded image.
A force behind the retail advance - to Pounds 523,000 (Pounds 140,000) on
turnover of Pounds 26.1m (Pounds 23.6m) - was the shop format called Austin
Reed Sportsman, which sells leisurewear. In the spring a women's leisurewear
line was launched.
The group has 50 outlets, though some - such as those in three of Heathrow
airport's terminals - are as small as 300 to 400 sq ft.
Profits from manufacturing for other retailers rose to Pounds 486,000
(Pounds 258,000) on turnover ahead from Pounds 5.66m to Pounds 7.06m. Mr
Thomson said that sales in Switzerland, Italy and Germany lost during the
recession were now being regained.
Borrowings were cut to Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 10.4m) and are expected to be
down to Pounds 3m by the year-end. Interest charges were halved at Pounds
306,000 (Pounds 601,000). Capital expenditure on store refurbishment will
total Pounds 4m for the year, against Pounds 2.5m.
Earnings were 3.9p (2p) per share and the interim dividend is held at 2p.

FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Churchill China hopes to raise Pounds 15m
in flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Churchill China, the third Staffordshire-based china company to float this
year, is expecting 1994 profits to exceed the record level of 1991.
The pathfinder prospectus yesterday forecast pre-tax profits, before bonuses
to directors, of Pounds 3.6m for the year to December 31. This would be
ahead of last year's Pounds 2.9m, struck on turnover of Pounds 36m, and
1991's Pounds 3.23m on sales of Pounds 31.5m.
The company, which celebrates its bicentenary next year, is owned by the
Roper family. It is aiming to raise Pounds 15m via a placing.
About two-thirds of the money will go to the three Roper brothers on the
board, their families and family trusts, while Pounds 5m will be used as
part of an investment programme to improve capacity and quality. 'In the
next five years investment in the company will be double the investment we
undertook in the previous five years,' said Mr Stephen Roper, chief
executive.
The Roper family, which has run the company since 1922, will own about 55
per cent of the company after the placing.
In addition to providing funds for investment, the group, which operates
tableware, hotelware and fine china divisions, expects the expanded
shareholder base to provide a market for existing shareholders and
opportunities for employees to invest.
Mr Roper described 1991 as an exceptional year, with exports to continental
Europe particularly strong. Recession in Germany and Spain knocked profits
back in 1992, but the upturn in business seen in 1993 had continued this
year.

FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Biocompatibles for market with Pounds 80m
valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Biocompatibles International, a research company that has developed a new
type of contact lens, is planning to float later this month as its products
begin to go on sale.
The company, which is expected to have a market value of about Pounds 80m,
is seeking up to Pounds 40m through the issue of new shares. Of the total,
Pounds 25m will be placed firm, with the balance available to meet retail
demand through intermediaries.
The pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, shows that the company had
accumulated losses of Pounds 9.77m at the end of June. It warns that
investment in the company involves a higher than normal degree of risk.
Mr Alistair Taylor, chief executive, stresses that the company is not a
biotechnology operation, but a maker of medical devices. It has Pounds 7m of
cash, which would last for a couple of years if it continued at its present
pace.
But it expects to spend Pounds 25m next year as it moves its contact lenses
into the French, German, and US markets and increases the pace of
development of other devices.
The existing shareholders, including Johnson &amp; Johnson with 8 per cent,
Biotechnology Investments, Cygnus Ventures and 3i, will retain their shares
for at least a year.
Biocompatibles was established in 1984 to develop products using
phosphorylcholine, or PC, a substance present in red blood cells and the
primary natural material responsible for biocompatibility.
PC was identified by Professor Dennis Chapman, of the Royal Free Hospital
School of Medicine in London, who holds 4 per cent of the equity.
The PC-based soft contact lens, to be known as Proclear, is aimed at people
who want to use contact lenses, but have found them uncomfortable. The
company says the lenses resist dehydration and cut the risk of bacterial
infection.
Mr Taylor expects the company to be generating cash in 1998, mostly from the
sale of contact lenses, which begins commercially this month.
The company has a licensing and co-operation agreement on eye care with NOF
Corporation of Japan. Last month it acquired Lombart Lenses, a contact lens
maker in the US, which accounts for half of the world market.
Sponsor to the issue is Robert Fleming and the broker is Smith New Court.

FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Beverley's reverse takeover by FEC
collapses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The proposed reverse takeover of Beverley Group by Hong Kong-based Far East
Consortium has collapsed, after FEC terminated a provisional agreement to
swap a Chinese boiler manufacturing subsidiary for a majority shareholding.
Beverley gave no explanation for the move, which follows more than three
months of negotiations.
The deal would have provided Beverley with its sole source of earnings.
FEC is controlled by the family of Mr Deacon Chiu, who built up a
conglomerate around a network of cinemas and property developments, but
became entangled in a series of legal battles.
In 1993, he had 14 charges of false accounting dropped against him, after he
was found unfit for trial due to senile dementia. Shareholders still voted
for him to retain his post as chairman.
In September that year, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange expressed 'major
concerns' over a property sale to Far East Hotels, a FEC group company. The
deal would have netted a HKDollars 506m (Pounds 41m) profit for Mr Chiu's
son Derek in less than a year, but the sale was withdrawn.
And last December, Hong Kong's Commercial Crime Bureau raided the FEC group
offices, in connection with a government investigation into the 1990 buy-out
of Alan Bond's Bond Corporation International Ltd. No charges have been
brought.
Beverley's purchase of Pegasus, which owns 51 per cent of a Guangzhou
(Canton) boiler manufacturer, was to have provided access to a high growth
market, and a positive cash flow.
Beverley's 1993 accounts were qualified, as its auditors were 'unable to
provide confirmation that it will have sufficient facilities to cover future
working capital'.
Its shares will remain suspended, and the company is looking at alternative
means of raising finance.

FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Hewden Stuart surges to Pounds 16m -
Increased demand and improved prices behind 78% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hewden Stuart, the UK's biggest independent plant hire group, said increased
demand and improved prices had helped it to increase pre-tax profits by 78
per cent from Pounds 9.1m to Pounds 16.2m in the six months to July 31.
Sir Matthew Goodwin, chairman, said trading was continuing at a high level
and he expected that pre-tax profits in the second half would be
'substantially ahead' of the Pounds 10m achieved last time.
Analysts upgraded their full-year forecasts from Pounds 27m to about Pounds
32m.
Turnover rose by 40 per cent to Pounds 128m (Pounds 91.7m). The group said
recovery from recession had increased the plant hire division's contribution
by 39 per cent to Pounds 81.6m, while the merchandising division's input
rose 40 per cent to Pounds 46.4m.
The crane hire division saw less buoyant conditions than elsewhere, but
moved from losses to an operating profit of Pounds 200,000.
Sir Matthew said trading was slow in Scotland, but became stronger further
south. The group had kept open all but one of the 41 depots acquired last
year when it paid Pounds 11m for the Hireplant assets of BET.
In spite of the sharp increase in turnover, the total number of employees
increased only marginally, from 3,650 to 3,786.
Capital expenditure in the first half exceeded Pounds 34m, bringing to
Pounds 100m investment in the past 18 months. Mr Sandy Findlay, chief
executive, said investment of not less than Pounds 25m was expected in the
second half and about Pounds 60m next year.
The investment came out of cashflow of Pounds 35m. The group said that by
the summer cashflow was running at more than Pounds 1.5m per week.
The chairman said: 'The rate of our cashflow is such that we will be able to
continue to fund our programme from the group resources, thus ensuring that
our policy of avoiding dilution of shareholders' interests by rights issues
is maintained.'
Earnings increased by 65 per cent to 4.94p (3p). The interim dividend was
0.825p (0.75p).
COMMENT
Sir Matthew was understandably jubilant over these results, which he
described as 'quite superb' and promised analysts 'you ain't seen anything
yet.' The strong recovery in profitability vindicates the group's decision
last summer to step up its investment in new plant. The performance is all
the more impressive considering that there are still areas of weakness -
such as crane towers and site accommodation. The shares were unchanged
yesterday at 146 1/2 p - a considerable achievement on a day the market
plunged. Forecast full-year profits of Pounds 32m put the shares on a
prospective multiple of 15. The 8 per cent premium to the market does not
look excessive for a group with this sort of track record and prospects.

FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Coats buys Charterhall offshoot from
receiver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coats Viyella, the UK's largest clothing and textiles company, yesterday
acquired Corah, the Leicester-based producer of underwear and knitted
fabrics, for a consideration believed to be about Pounds 25m cash.
Coats has been negotiating since May to buy Corah from the receiver to
Charterhall, Corah's holding company. Charterhall went into receivership in
1990 after its Australian owner, Westmex, went into liquidation.
The acquisition, which will be finalised following the preparation of
completed accounts, comes after Coats identified clothing as one of its key
growth sectors at the announcement of its interim results last month.
Corah, which supplies Marks and Spencer, expects pre-tax profits to be at
least Pounds 3.8m on turnover of about Pounds 63m for the year to October 2.
Net assets are roughly Pounds 5m, after writing off debts.
The company will join Coats' clothing division, which at the interim stage
reported reduced operating profits of Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 5.2m) after
closing a uniform factory in South Wales.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BZW and Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull are post-poning the launch of an
investment trust because of the poor market for new issues.
The Infostructure Trust, which would invest mostly in companies quoted on
emerging stock markets and operate across the information industry, was to
have been launched with a public offer for subscription opening in the last
week of October.
The offer is now likely to take place in the new year.

FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Hogg pays Pounds 13m for Inchcape
operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hogg Robinson, the travel, transport and financial services group, has paid
Pounds 13m for the whole of the UK and 50 per cent of the Hong Kong-based
financial services operations of Bain Hogg Group, the insurance broking arm
of Inchcape.
Inchcape bought the Hogg Group, an insurance broker, for Pounds 176.6m in
April and merged it with its own insurance broking subsidiary, Bain
Clarkson, renaming the enlarged company Bain Hogg.
The Bain Hogg activities being acquired are almost identical to those of
Hogg Robinson Financial Services: employee benefits, pensions advice and
financial counselling.
Last year the UK businesses made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.2m on sales of
Pounds 17m, while the Hong Kong business made a negligible trading loss in
its start-up year. Net assets of the businesses are Pounds 500,000.

FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Servisair achieves target Pounds 54.3m
value in float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Servisair, the independent aircraft and passenger handling company, has
announced that despite current market indigestion for new issues its
flotation was fully underwritten at its target price, valuing the company at
Pounds 54.3m.
The company's parent, Securum, is selling 60 per cent of its stake.
Servisair is offering a further 7.4m new shares, making a total offer of
24.12m shares priced at 135p.
The company is forecast to make profits of Pounds 4.2m before exceptional
items, putting the shares on a price-earnings ratio of 14.7, which is
roughly the stock market average.
It is offering 6.03m of the shares to intermediaries. This portion of the
offer should get a boost from the news yesterday that Servisair has won a
10-year baggage-handling contract at Glasgow airport, the UK's fourth
largest.
Servisair already operates passenger and cargo handling services at Glasgow,
which should contribute about Pounds 5m to this year's revenues. The
baggage-handling contract should add at least 10 per cent to that figure.
The company has also secured 10-year contracts for its other operations in
Glasgow.
Servisair will pay a notional dividend of 3.8p for 1994, representing a
notional gross dividend yield of 3.5 per cent.
The offer to intermediaries closes on October 12 and trading is scheduled to
start on October 18.
COMMENT
Servisair has done well to achieve a high price in an unfavourable market,
but does not appear to have left much for the stags. It offers the
advantages of a long management track record, a decade of profits growth,
and a relatively dependable source of earnings. It also has a strong
argument for new business. Airlines in the UK and Europe are starting to
contract out lower margin, non-core activities such as passenger and
aircraft handling. The old monopolies are being broken, as at Glasgow,
providing a convincing medium-term picture. As most of the short-term
attractions are well accounted for in the offer price, it must be classed as
a stock for the patient.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Hewden Stuart chief takes a swipe at City short-termists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chairman of Hewden Stuart, the UK's biggest independent plant hire
company, took a swipe at the City yesterday when the group reported interim
profits well above expectations.
Sir Matthew Goodwin, former deputy chairman of the Scottish Conservatives,
blamed short-termist pressure from the City for the failure of many British
companies to maintain investment through the last recession.
He attributed the sharp rebound in the Glasgow-based group's profits to
heavy investment in new plant - worth more than Pounds 100m in the last 18
months.
Hewden Stuart reported a 77 per cent increase in half-year profits to Pounds
16.2m - about 20 per cent ahead of City expectations. Sir Matthew said
trading was continuing at a high level and told analysts: 'You ain't seen
anything yet.'
Sir Matthew, 65, a chartered accountant who has been chairman since 1979,
said he 'did not give a damn' when the group's pre-tax profits collapsed to
Pounds 12m in 1992, compared with Pounds 36m in 1989, at the peak of the
boom. Cash flow, the most important element in evaluating a company, had
remained strong and the company continued to invest in spite of the
downturn.
Known for its cautious approach, the group decided to increase capital
expenditure sharply in July 1993, when it became convinced that recovery was
definitely on the way. It secured good terms from manufacturers, such as a
Belgian supplier of compressors which was about to put its workforce on a
three-day week.
Sir Matthew said the group had continued to invest, even although doing so
depressed immediate profitability.
He said it was 'a tragedy' that so few companies had maintained investment
during the recession and blamed the City's constant demand for short-term
performance. He noted that British Steel had recently warned that supplies
of steel were already tightening. He said: 'Coming from Scotland, you have
to wonder whether we should ever have shut Ravenscraig. We also see
shortages of bricks, because so many kilns have been closed.'
Sir Matthew did not conceal his pleasure at exceeding the analysts'
forecasts. He said Hewden Stuart had decided not to try to upgrade
expectations, since such guidance gave an unfair advantage to institutions
and 'was tantamount to insider dealing'.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Purdey goes out with a bang
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
James Purdey &amp; Sons, Britain's most famous sporting gunmaker, is giving up
its independence nearly 200 years after James Purdey set up shop in London's
Piccadilly. The company yesterday announced that it was being sold for an
undisclosed sum to Vendome, the luxury goods group which owns Dunhill and
Cartier.
The deal, which sees Purdey's ultimate ownership transferring to a Swiss
holding company, mirrors the sale of Purdey's leading rival Holland &amp;
Holland to Chanel for Pounds 11m in 1989. Vendome and Purdey would provide
no further details of the deal, which, because of its size, was not the
subject of an official announcement.
But the companies stressed that Purdey would 'continue its activities
entirely unchanged' under the chairmanship of the Hon Richard Beaumont.
Founded in 1818, Purdey has always aimed at the top end of the market, with
its best double-gun then costing about Pounds 55. Today the price would be
closer to Pounds 40,000. Even so, there are 100 customers on an 18-month
waiting list.
Purdey has had a somewhat chequered financial history, suffering
particularly from difficulties in extracting prompt payment from its
upper-class customers. In the founder's day, the company occasionally waited
10 years between the sale and final payment. Based in Mayfair, the company
now makes guns, rifles and cartridges, sells a range of shooting accessories
and runs a shooting school.
Vendome was formed in August last year by combining the luxury goods
interests of Richemont, the Swiss holding company based on the South African
Rupert family's stake in cigarette group Rothmans.
In addition to Dunhill and Cartier, Vendome owns watch makers Piaget and
Baume Mercier, Montblanc pens and Chloe, the fashion and perfume house. More
recently it has bought Karl Lagerfeld's women's fashion business and the UK
traditional menswear company Hackett.
Vendome, which is 70 per cent owned by Richemont, made a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 196m in the year to March, down 5 per cent.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Bank of Scotland builds capital for lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank of Scotland yesterday said it would continue building up capital to
back future lending growth as it disclosed an 81 per cent rise in interim
pre-tax profits from Pounds 117.6m to Pounds 213.2m.
The bank achieved a 6 per cent 'tier one' ratio of core capital to
risk-weighted assets - an international benchmark for capital strength  - by
doubling earnings per share from 5.4p to 10.9p.
But its shares fell by 10p to 196p with disappointment about a 13.9 per cent
rise in the interim dividend from 1.87p to 2.13p.
Mr Bruce Pattullo, the bank's governor, said it needed to retain earnings to
be able to grow. He added there was 'clearly room to think' about the
full-year dividend given cover five times earnings for the half year, but
'the market knows that we need retentions to finance growth, and we are not
going to do anything daft'.
Unlike the 'big four' English clearing banks, Bank of Scotland increased
lending by 4 per cent from the year-end to Pounds 23.6bn. Most of the rise
came in England, where the bank has increased its market share.
Net interest income rose by 13 per cent from Pounds 376.4m to Pounds 424.7m,
including a Pounds 10.9m dividend from the flotation of the venture capital
group 3i. The net interest margin widened from 2.58 per cent to 2.71 per
cent.
Although margins on loans to large companies fell because of the
re-emergence of competition among banks, the squeeze was offset by improved
margins on wholesale deposits, and maintenance of mortgage margins.
The ratio of costs to income fell to 47.9 per cent from 48.9 per cent
despite a 9 per cent rise in costs from Pounds 271m to Pounds 295.6m. This
included a Pounds 12.6m provision for payments to staff under a
profit-sharing scheme. Specific bad-debt provisions fell to Pounds 109.8m
from Pounds 157.9m, and there was a further general provision of Pounds
8.8m, compared with Pounds 16.5m. The bank said economic recovery should
benefit provisions in the second half.
Non-interest income rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 198.3m, including a rise of
Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 81.9m in branch-based commissions in the clearing
bank. Mr Pattullo said growing competition would limit the scope for further
rises.
Difficulties at Forthright Finance, a finance house, led to a fall in
pre-tax profits at its Bank of Wales arm to Pounds 0.3m from Pounds 0.4m,
but NWS Bank increased profits from Pounds 37.6m to Pounds 48.3m.
Bank of Scotland is still considering acquiring a building society, which
could provide cheaper retail funding. But Mr Pattullo said it had no need to
find an outlet for excess capital.
Annualised pre-tax return on equity rose to 34.4 per cent from 19.2 per
cent, and annualised return on assets rose to 1.4 per cent from 0.8 per
cent. The tier 1 capital ratio rose to 6 per cent from 5.8 per cent.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Hands-on executives: this one's for you
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electronic publishing is in turmoil. Yesterday's deal is just one indicator
of a wave of change sweeping through the sector promising new growth
opportunities. Another is the emergence of Apple and Microsoft as potential
competitors to established players such as Compuserve and America On Line.
The market is not homogeneous. Companies like Mead, Dialog and Dow-Jones
News retrieval of the US and FT Profile and Reuters of the UK are serving
essentially the professional market, providing data to experienced
information managers. On the other hand, companies like Compuserve, owned by
H&amp;R Block, America On Line and Prodigy, a joint venture between IBM and
Sears, are chiefly, but not exclusively, aimed at consumers. Information is
a commodity to be bought and sold, however, and the data provided through
one service may have originated on another.
There is a further distinction between companies like Mead and Dialog, which
operate on a 'dial-up' basis, and companies like Reuters or Telekurs where
information is transmitted and updated continuously.
All on-line data suppliers have their eyes on a new target market: the
'executive end-user'. They are racing to make it easier and cheaper for
executives to carry out their own searches for information. Some, for
example, are building in 'Windows', the graphical interface popularised by
Microsoft. Prices are being pegged to a flat monthly fee.
In earlier years, on-line services of the kind provided by Mead or Dialog
were aimed at information professionals. Executives did not carry out their
own searches but requested information from librarians trained to use
complex methods of data retrieval. It was expensive; at up to Pounds 120 an
hour for some services, too costly to allow the inexperienced to roam
aimlessly through the databases.
A result was that the market, although potentially vast, grew much more
slowly than anticipated and in the past few years has been showing signs of
saturation. Profitability has been a problem for some suppliers.
Now the technologies which are making multimedia possible are giving on-line
database services new life. The secret seems to lie in providing on-line
services to appeal to executives at home and in the office.

FT  06 OCT 94 / North America proves the right connection for an on-line
future: Tim Burt explains why Reed Elsevier's purchase of Mead Data Central
marks a move away from print
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch information and publishing group, will today
celebrate its listing on the New York Stock Exchange by announcing that
North America has become its most important market.
Its arrival on Wall Street has coincided neatly with news that Reed Elsevier
has agreed to pay Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 950m) for Mead Data Central - the
distributor of on-line legal and business information - in a deal likely to
contribute Dollars 612m of sales and profits of about Dollars 75m next year.
The move followed six months of talks with Mead Corporation, the US paper
and forest products group which announced plans in May to sell MDC, whose
on-line publishing operations include Lexis and Nexis.
Despite the protracted negotiations, Reed Elsevier only found out at the
weekend that it had beaten rival bids by Times Mirror, the US media group,
and Thomson of Canada when Salomon Brothers, its US adviser, telephoned its
executives at the Grand Canyon, where they were taking a break from meetings
with US investors.
'We heard we that were the prefered bidder as we watched the sun go down,'
said Mr Nigel Stapleton, finance director. 'We were expecting to be outbid,
but we obviously made a knock-out offer.'
For Mr Pierre Vinken, the group's Dutch co-chairman, the acquisition marks
an important step in a strategy first launched 15 years ago, when Elsevier -
which merged in 1993 with Reed International of the UK - targeted North
America as the world's most lucrative publishing market.
The group's sales in North America rose 24 per cent to Pounds 1.04bn last
year - 37 per cent of the group total - while operating profits grew to
Pounds 194m.
While predicting MDC would boost those figures next year, Mr Vinken admitted
the group would be unable to make a similar sized acquisition in the near
future. He hinted, however, that it was considering smaller deals to expand
its presence in the region. Its attention is focusing on parts of Ziff
Communications, the world's largest publisher of computer magazines.
'We are researching Ziff as if we had not acquired Mead. If there are parts
of the business to go for, we have the capacity to buy them', he added.
The group also outlined plans to increase spending on its electronic
publishing businesses by Pounds 10m a year to Pounds 30m. Mr Vinken said the
increased investment would probably be matched by a slowdown in resources
devoted consumer publishing, its lower margin magazine, books and newspaper
business. Imminent disposals are unlikely, but expansion of regional
newspapers and magazines such as Woman's Own and TV Times has also been
ruled out.
Reed Elsevier's investment plans have centred instead on three higher margin
publishing businesses: scientific and medical, business and professional. Of
those, MDC will be integrated into the professional sector.
Its maiden contribution next year will signal a shift from the group's
dependence on hard copy publishing to increasing use of on-line information.
Electronic publishing is expected to grow from 10 per cent of turnover to
more than 20 per cent next year, and Mr Vinken has ambitions to expand it
further. He hopes MDC's technology can be adapted to offer Reed Elsevier's
scientific journals and enhance its extensive medical database. 'We have
acquired a massive electronic warehouse and the possibilities are enormous.
Overnight, we have turned into a state-of-the-art electronic publisher.'

FT  06 OCT 94 / Telling on tax dodgers earns a qualified reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inland Revenue revealed yesterday that it pays informants who help it to
catch tax dodgers. Unfortunately for the informers, it taxes them on the
extra income.
The disclosure that the Revenue has paid up to Pounds 20,000 a case for
information leading to the recovery of unpaid tax is tempered by its
insistence that each individual reward should be notified as unearned income
untaxed at source.
The sums however, are not always so large. Payments can be less than Pounds
50 and have never exceeded a 'handful' in any recent year. In the year to
March 1994 it paid out a total of Pounds 7,050, Pounds 2,750 in the year
before, and Pounds 24,250 the year before that.
In its annual report, the Revenue pointed out that funds recovered with the
help of informers formed a small part of the Pounds 4.7bn collected in the
last financial year in non-compliance - equivalent to 2.5p in basic income
tax.
However, it will not be turning informants away. 'We are obliged to
investigate any information brought to our attention. We take no moral
stance,' an official said.
Under legislation dating from 1890, the Revenue is entitled to pay up to
Pounds 50 for information. Any payments over that level must be approved by
the Treasury. All payments are discretionary.
The revenue emphasises that payments are made only after a successful
investigation and the recovery of funds. A secret formula relates the reward
to the amount of the recovery.
'In most cases a reward is not what they are looking for,' the official
said, but some ask if one exists. Personal grievances between business or
marital partners are a common reason for information being offered.
In one case study released with the annual report, an informant told the
Revenue of Pounds 150,000 transferred by Mr A from an account in Jersey to
the UK. No record existed in Mr A's tax returns of offshore accounts.
Mr A denied the charge but, using statutory powers, the revenue confirmed
it, and the bank's security video showed Mr A withdrawing the funds in
person. He was sentenced to 12 months in prison and fined Pounds 10,000 plus
costs.
In another, unrelated case, a group of Revenue executives known as
'ghostbusters' discovered coach drivers working for a local company who were
selling refreshments and souvenirs, and offering duty-free goods by pooling
passengers' unused allowances.
Much of the extra income was not declared. So far, 10 of the 18 moonlighters
have settled with the Revenue, which is seeking repayment of Pounds 70,000.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Russian deal with banks paves way for debt plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia cleared the way yesterday for a rescheduling of its Dollars 24bn
(Pounds 15.1bn) commercial bank debt by reaching a compromise with its 600
creditor banks on a legal obstacle which has blocked progress for the past
year.
They agreed a legal framework for re-scheduling bank debt - part of Dollars
90bn Russia owes to banks, foreign governments and trade creditors. It is
likely to make an initial payment of up to Dollars 500m this year.
The compromise was over the banks' earlier call for Russia to waive
'sovereign immunity', which would have allowed banks to seize assets if debt
was unpaid. Instead of this, Russia made a statement committing itself to
payment obligations.
The Russian government intends to follow the agreement - signed yesterday in
Madrid at the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World
Bank - with attempts to lower other parts of its debt burden.
Mr Christian Vontz, chairman of the London Club of commercial banks, said
that the agreement would 'give the Russian government a breathing space to
deal with its domestic problems' before starting to repay debt.
The banks also agreed to accept the state-controlled Vneshekonombank as the
body assuming legal responsibility for the debt.
'Negotiations may take some time, but the result is already there,' Mr Vontz
said.
The re-scheduling is likely to allow Russia a grace period of five to 10
years before it has to start making capital repayments. The Dollars 500m
payment covers a portion of interest on the capital due in 1992 and 1993.
Although the agreement does not improve the government's financial position
 -since it has not been making payments to banks - Mr Alexander Shokhin,
deputy prime minister, hailed it as 'a vote of confidence'.
He said that the deal 'signals that Russia is beginning to put behind it the
financial consequences of the collapse of the former Soviet Union', the
debts of which it assum-ed when the union broke up.
The deal was some consolation to the Russian government after a testing week
during which it was rebuffed over an attempt to increase its IMF borrowing
facilities, and an effort to postpone other debt repayments.
It is likely to have talks with IMF officials later this month on its
request for larger facilities. This could be followed by separate talks with
the Paris club of government creditors over some Dollars 42bn of debt.
However, Russia received warnings from the Group of Seven leading
industrialised nations last weekend that it should control domestic
inflation, and creditor governments want it to reach an IMF deal before
re-scheduling debt. Bank creditors include Deutsche Bank, Credit Lyonnais
and Industrial Bank of Japan. Mr Vontz, a Deutsche executive, said the deal
'accepts the Russian government in the banking and financial community of
the world'.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Mitsubishi enters bidding for S Wales region of British Coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mitsubishi, the Japanese conglomerate, has joined the bidding to take over
British Coal mining assets when the state company is privatised this year.
Its participation in a bid for the south Wales region is a boost for the
privatisation, which has largely failed to attract the involvement of
overseas companies in spite of worldwide marketing.
Mitsubishi is only the second foreign company to be a confirmed bidder for
any of the five regions on offer. The other is Alcan Aluminium of Canada,
which is bidding for British Coal's north-east England region in partnership
with Ryan Group of the UK.
Mitsubishi is joining Taylor Woodrow, the UK construction company, and Kier
Mining, a UK coal company, to bid.
Taylor Woodrow confirmed the joint venture yesterday, although Mitsubishi
was unable to comment. Mitsubishi, Taylor Woodrow and Kier are thought to
have roughly equal stakes in the venture.
Mitsubishi has wide industrial interests including coal. It is involved in
Australian mining through its Mitsubishi Development subsidiary and in UK
coal trading through Mitsubishi Corporation Coal Sales.
Taylor Woodrow has been involved in UK mining since the 1940s and has
opencast interests in south Wales and Northumberland.
The combination of the two companies, together with the much smaller Kier
Mining, presents a powerful bidding partnership for British Coal's most
popular region in the privatisation.
The confirmation of the bid means that at least eight companies or consortia
are bidding for the nine opencast sites in south Wales, whereas the central
England regions - where virtually all of the deep mines are based - are
thought to have attracted just three or four serious bidders each.
Wales is attractive because of the relative abundance of high-quality coal
near the surface. British Coal produces about 2.4m tonnes a year from the
region, all of it from opencast sites.
Although south Wales has smaller coal sale contracts than other regions,
National Power, the electricity generator, wants long-term deals from the
post-privatisation owner to supply its Aberthaw power station.
It has already signed a 10-year deal with Ryan Group for 1.5m tonnes of coal
a year from south Wales. The deal is conditional on Ryan's winning the bid
for the region.

FT  06 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: US healthcare
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Forget the Clintons. US healthcare reform is forging on without them. The
latest consolidation was yesterday's merger between Columbia/HCA Healthcare
and HealthTrust, the country's two biggest hospital groups. The deal creates
a Dollars 15bn company with 311 hospitals and 170,000 employees. That makes
it the 12th largest employer in the US - not bad for a company which in 1992
generated sales of just Dollars 1.2bn and controlled only 23 hospitals.
Columbia's strategy is simple. It purchases several hospitals in a specific
region and improves profitability by rationalising them. At its most brutal
the group strips a hospital of all equipment, knocks it down and then sells
the real estate. Cost savings are also achieved by using greater purchasing
power - it annually buys Dollars 2.5bn of hospital supplies - to drive down
prices.
Doubts remain whether Columbia can continue to implement its strategy
successfully. The easiest cost-cutting has been completed and the biggest
hospital groups have been snapped up. The company argues it can maintain
momentum by branching into other fields such as nursing homes. Even if
Columbia stumbles, the pressure on hospital suppliers is unlikely to let up.
Other groups such as National Medical in California and Epic in Texas are
replicating its strategy. Given the prospects for hospital supply companies'
pricing and volumes, their shares' 17 per cent underperformance since
January 1993 is no surprise.

FT  06 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Storehouse
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Retailers' share prices have fallen back sharply in the past few weeks,
primarily in response to higher UK interest rates. But the outlook is not
wholly dismal, especially for those companies still with scope for
restructuring. Next and Sears have both recently reported strong interim
profits growth. Yesterday Storehouse gave a highly positive trading
statement.
Storehouse detailed plans for increases in selling space at Bhs, hinted at
large benefits to be extracted from the re-engineering of the supply chain,
and signalled a sharp increase in capital expenditure. It also said that
sales growth would reach an annual rate of 7 per cent for the first half, up
from 5 per cent in the first quarter. Even if the sales growth was to some
extent triggered by aggressive advertising, the City was impressed and the
shares rose against the market.
There is much to be impressed about. Storehouse's strategy looks correct;
its concentration on Bhs and Mothercare leaves the group well-focused. The
earnings recovery is in full swing. Operating margins at Bhs seem set to
rise from 3.5 per cent in 1993 to around 10 per cent next year. There is
also scope for rolling-out the revamped Bhs formula further. The danger is
that management may fall into the retailing trap of over-zealous expansion.
The shares are rated in line with the retail sector, if Marks &amp; Spencer is
excluded. That is high enough till it becomes clear whether Storehouse can
sustain its success.

FT  06 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Bank of Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After this week's turmoil in the merchant banking sector, Bank of Scotland's
results throw into sharp relief the question of what constitutes quality
earnings from banking. While the merchant banks were wrestling with the
collapse of returns from securities trading, Bank of Scotland has been
making good profits out of old-fashioned lending. Provisions, which were
never as high as those of other banks, are coming down; interest income is
rising; and first-half pre-tax return on capital is 34 per cent. Yet there
must be doubts about how long the bank can keep up its act.
After all, there will not be another special dividend from 3i. Margins on
mortgage lending will be compressed by higher base rates and the decline in
non-performing loans will slow. The chances of Bank of Scotland being able
to compensate for this with strong growth in its loan book are slim, which
is why its focus on raising its capital ratio through retained earnings
looks a little perverse.
A more valid point is that even well-managed lending institutions are not
immune from the cycle, so a degree of dividend-smoothing makes sense. Bank
of Scotland is unlikely to sustain its present return - the slippage of
profits from credit cards is a particularly ominous sign of increasing
competition. But quality of earnings will be enhanced if the bank resists
the temptation to follow the herd in making loans at foolish prices. Having
managed prudent balance sheet growth in the recession, the bank should be
applauded if it fails to be carried away by the recovery.

<TEXT>
Reed Elsevier's Dollars 1.5bn purchase of electronic publisher Mead Data
Central should have benefits in the short, medium and long terms. The
immediate enhancement to earnings per share comes from the tax relief that
Reed will enjoy in the US on the amortisation of Dollars 1.27bn of goodwill
 -a wheeze Reed also employed when it bought Official Airline Guides last
year. The tax relief reduces the historic price-earnings multiple from 36 to
20. If MDC maintains the strong growth in profits shown so far this year,
the 1994 multiple will be only 17.
The medium-term benefit should come from boosting margins. With a paper
company as a parent, MDC's operating margins have been stuck in the 12-15
per cent range. Reed argues that it should be possible to push margins to
nearer its 20 per cent norm for professional publishing; costs can be cut,
higher-value products can be developed and MDC's services can be marketed
more vigorously, notably outside the US. There is, of course, a risk that
margins could be depressed through price competition. The most vulnerable
part of MDC is Nexis, its business information arm, which is essentially an
electronic warehouse for other companies' information. But the Lexis legal
information arm - the largest and most profitable part of MDC - looks better
protected as most of its data is proprietary.
The long-term bet is that MDC's electronic culture can be transferred to the
rest of the Reed empire. Plans are so far rather woolly. But it seems likely
that scientists and doctors, who currently take Reed's information in hard
copy, will eventually want access at touch of a button. MDC could prove the
group's ticket to the multimedia superhighway.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Still much too close to call: Germany's small parties hold
the Kohl government's future in their hands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY and QUENTIN PEEL

<TEXT>
'This time,' says the general election poster for Germany's liberal Free
Democratic party, 'everything is at stake.' That could be painfully true for
the FDP, the centre party of German politics and kingmaker in almost every
coalition since 1949. In the general election on October 16, the party is in
danger of being voted out of the Bundestag, the lower house of Germany's
federal parliament, for the first time since the foundation of the federal
republic 45 years ago.
Yet the message of the poster means much more. This is the first election in
an integrated, united Germany, with all the parties competing for votes in
east and west under the same rules.
The last election in 1990, immediately after unification, was carried out
under special rules to ensure that the newly enfranchised easterners were
adequately represented in the German parliament. And in the euphoria of the
moment, many voters, especially in the east, endorsed the 'unity chancellor'
 -Mr Helmut Kohl.
The results of the 1994 election will show not just how the players have
changed, but how the playing field has been transformed by the advent of 17m
new inhabitants emerging from 40 years of communist dictatorship.
With just 10 days to go before the poll, the result is too close to call.
The Bundestag will still be dominated by Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union (CDU) and its great rivals, the Social Democratic party (SPD). But
nobody knows which other parties will scrape in alongside them. Yet the
make-up of the next German government will be dictated by the small parties
 -the FDP, the Greens, and the party of Democratic Socialism, the reformed
east German communists.
The Greens - who failed to gain 5 per cent of the vote cast, the minimum
needed to get into the Bundestag, in 1990 - are expecting to win sufficient
votes to get back this time. However, they are unlikely to win enough
support to form a majority with the SPD, their natural partners. The SPD
will need a third partner to unseat Mr Kohl.
That could be the FDP. But the Free Democrats have failed to gain 5 per cent
of the votes in six consecutive state elections in the past 12 months, and
in last June's European poll.
The other unknown is what happens to the party of Democratic Socialism
(PDS). If it gets into the Bundestag, it could deny a parliamentary majority
to Mr Kohl and his ruling coalition.
At the PDS headquarters in east Berlin - in the former institute of
Marxism-Leninism - the mood is supremely confident. Mr Gregor Gysi, the
one-time defence lawyer for anti-communist dissidents who now leads the
party in the Bundestag, is convinced the party can win three constituencies
outright in Berlin. Under German election rules, that is enough to get the
party into parliament with anything up to 30 seats, even if it fails to win
5 per cent of the popular vote.
'We have managed to speak out for the interests of the east Germans who
still feel alienated and who still feel they have a separate identity,' says
Mr Gysi.
East Germany's economy remains sluggish and unemployment is high. But recent
studies by the Martin Luther University in Halle and the Infratest Burke
Berlin, a polling organisation, with Die Zeit, the weekly newspaper, show
that the majority of east Germans are now far more optimistic about their
daily lives and economic prospects than they were last year.
The studies also show that more than 50 per cent of those polled hold little
regard for the PDS's policies. Moreover, the PDS has not projected itself as
the party of the unemployed. According to Deutschland Archiv, a journal
specialising in the unification process, 'the unemployed and the
under-educated have only average representation' in the PDS.
Despite these trends, the former communists have so far managed to retain
about one-fifth of the vote in recent state elections.
One reason for the PDS's electoral survival is that east Germans vote for
personalities, not policies. 'This is where the PDS has a real advantage,'
says Mr Wulf Oehme, manager of the FDP's Berlin office.
'The candidates are known locally. They have not come from the west. They
have the benefit of understanding what unification means to the east
Germans. They belong,' he explains.
Another reason is that the hard core of the PDS voters - former civil
servants, white collar workers, graduates, academics and pensioners - still
hankers after some vague form of social equality.
'If a majority of eastern Germans view equality as more important than
freedom, it may be due to the fact that they already enjoy freedom and still
miss equality,' according to Ms Ilse Spittmann, editor of Deutschland
Archiv.
Mr Gysi agrees. 'Unification is a psychological process as much as a
political one,' he says.
'Unlike the political establishment which keeps preaching to the east
Germans that the past 40 years were a waste of time, we say that not
everything of the former system was bad, that they still have a voice, and
that the state must play a role. We are that voice.'
The mood in the FDP, in west Germany as in the east, is more gloomy. This is
the party of the German Mittelstand, the shopkeepers and professional
classes. In the west, those supporters seem to be deserting the party. In
the east, they still don't really exist.
One accusation by its opponents is that the party has lost its identity in
the struggle to remain in power, first with the SPD from 1969 to 1982,
latterly with the CDU. Mr Gerhard Schroder, the SPD premier of Lower Saxony,
says it is guilty of 'merciless opportunism'.
Count Otto Lambsdorff, the last FDP leader who stepped down in 1993, admits
at least part of the charge. 'If he means that we want to be in the
government, and to do so we must be opportunistic, I would agree.
'We don't want to be in opposition. That would be stupid,' he says. 'But we
must not abandon our liberal principles.'
Yet the party's liberalism has been squeezed. Many of its liberal policies
have been stolen by its bigger rivals. Free-market liberalism, including
greater deregulation and progressive privatisation, is now a central plank
of Mr Kohl's government policy. As for the party's commitment to civil
liberties, that has been stolen by the SPD.
At the same time, the FDP has been unable to maintain a clear profile for
the voters. Count Lambsdorff believes this is a result of the size of the
present conservative-liberal coalition majority, thanks to Mr Kohl's
landslide win in 1990.
'We must not give up on our liberal principles, but we may have run that
risk in the past four years,' he says. 'I hear the complaints at our
election meetings, that we allowed a health reform bill to be passed which
seriously limits the activities of the self-employed, our natural
constituency.'
The FDP also agreed to the introduction of a publicly financed insurance
scheme to care for the old and handicapped that has hit small businesses
hard. 'I have considerable understanding for that charge,' Count Lambsdorff
says.
The survival of the FDP now looks to depend on the long-standing tradition
of German voters giving their second votes - for party lists as opposed to
individual candidates - to the liberals. There are two factors that make
that less likely to happen.
One is that voters in the east have never known that tradition. Having shown
little understanding of liberal-market economics, they may not be inclined
to adopt it.
The other is that after a row of defeats, voters may start to question
whether there is any point in keeping the FDP in parliament.
According to the latest opinion poll, based on the second-vote preferences
of electors, the FDP will make the 5 per cent threshold. So will the PDS.
The present coalition would then be barely 1 per cent in front of the
combined forces of the leftwing opposition.
It is well within the potential margin of error of the polls. But it is
certainly much too close for Mr Kohl's comfort.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Berlusconi on the brink
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The end of the beginning, or the beginning of the end? Just a week after the
Italian government issued a signal of hope by agreeing tough action on
pensions and health reform in the 1995 budget, new and darker clouds are
starting to gather around the figure of Mr Silvio Berlusconi.
Yesterday's row between the Italian prime minister and Mr Francesco Saverio
Borrelli, a senior Milan anti-corruption magistrate, brings to a head five
months of simmering discord between Mr Berlusconi's government and an
independent-minded judiciary. It exposes anew some of the contradictions in
Italy's attempts to produce judicial solutions to deeply entrenched problems
of corruption.
On a wider level, the clash raises fresh doubts about the credibility of the
country's efforts to establish a stronger and less self-serving political
system. Against the background of rising anxiety on international financial
markets about Italy's public debt mountain, the prime minister's hold on
power appears increasingly uncertain even though his election triumph was as
recent as last March. And there is no sign of a successor better qualified
to deliver the stability Italy requires.
Mr Berlusconi took office with a strong mandate to improve the standards of
Italian leadership as a means of putting the country's political and
economic structures on to a sounder footing. Although his objectives may
have been worthy, his execution so far has been poor. He has failed to bring
about the most elementary, and arguably the most important, precondition for
accomplishing his goal: clearing up the conflicts of interest inherent in
his position as head of the Fininvest media group.
Extraordinary criticism
In his interview with the Corriere della Sera newspaper yesterday, Mr
Borrelli dropped a broad hint that one trail being followed by corruption
investigators may lead to Mr Berlusconi's own door. The Milan prosecutor
said an investigation into alleged irregularities at a pay TV company in
which Fininvest is a shareholder risked reaching 'high levels in financial
and political circles'.
Mr Borrelli's extraordinary criticism both of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Alfredo
Biondi, the justice minister, may have been ill-judged. The episode will add
momentum to growing complaints in Rome of the politicisation of the
judiciary. However, when Fininvest is the subject of at least seven lines of
judicial inquiry, the prime minister cannot pretend that strong language
from the magistrates comes as a surprise.
Unpredictable outcomes
The forcefulness of the intervention from Milan leaves Mr Berlusconi with
two broad avenues for action, both of them unpalatable, and with
unpredictable outcomes. The first would be to raise the stakes still further
in the battle with the magistrates, a consequence that would certainly stem
from realisation of yesterday's government threat to take legal action
against Mr Borrelli.
Given the passions already aroused by more than two years of corruption
scandals, turning Mr Borrelli into a martyr would not only heighten the
danger of a break-up of Mr Berlusconi's coalition. It could also deliver a
fatal blow to the chances of bringing to a just and even-handed conclusion
the many judicial corruption inquiries dogging a large number of senior
Italian corporate and public figures.
The second option would be for Mr Berlusconi at last to take convincing
steps to clarify the questions surrounding his stewardship of Fininvest. He
could offer investigating magistrates full help in clearing his name from
any suspicions of impropriety, and at the same time adopt decisive measures
to separate his activities in government from those of his media company.
Last weekend's move by president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to forestall the
government's attempt to increase fees paid by the Rai state broadcasting
group reinforced the widespread impression that the government's decisions
are not always impartial. Mr Berlusconi must now act to show that he places
the interests of his country above those of his business. Unless he assuages
these doubts, Italy's political and financial uncertainties will grow.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Brussels' foot on the brake
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In proposing to renew the block exemption of motor industry distribution
practices from EU competition law, the European Commission says it aims to
balance the interests of all involved. But that balance remains tilted far
too heavily in favour of producers, at the expense of the interests of
consumers and economic efficiency. Furthermore, the Commission's approach
raises disquieting questions about its attitude to the single market.
Yesterday's decision preserves the central principles of the existing
exemption. Manufacturers will continue to be able to choose which dealers
they supply and to limit them to selling only one brand at one location,
while permitting dealers exclusive franchises within designated territories.
Most of the amendments proposed amount to tinkering, not fundamental reform.
Some merely formalise practices already common, notably in the UK. They
include the right of dealers to stock competing brands at separate outlets
and to advertise outside their franchise territories. Other changes seek to
tackle some of the more pernicious abuses of the existing regime. For
instance, Brussels aims to loosen manufacturers' monopoly over spare parts
and to reduce obstacles to cross-border car purchases, repeatedly blamed by
consumers' organisations for creating gaping differences in car prices
across the EU. However, many of these obstacles are already supposed to be
illegal. Brussels' failure to correct them in the past inspires little
confidence that the new rules will be enforced any more vigorously.
Radical approach
A much more radical approach was needed. The Commission should have started
by questioning the scope of the exemption. It was originally granted on the
grounds that cars are complex products which require big investments in
after-sales service facilities. Yet it also extends to new vehicle sales. No
convincing economic case has been made for treating the two businesses as
one. Doing so impedes efficiency by encouraging cross-subsidies between
them.
Equally, continuing restrictions on multi-brand dealerships deter innovation
in retailing and deny car-buyers the convenience of comparing a wide range
of competing models in one showroom. Abolishing these curbs need neither
affect manufacturers' power to discipline wayward dealers, nor lead to
unhealthy concentration of distribution, provided competition policy were
applied effectively.
Probably the proposal's biggest weakness, however, is that it relies too
much on vaguely worded prohibitions of abuses by manufacturers. It would
have been far more effective to have spelt out clearly specific rights to
which consumers were entitled. Nowhere is this more so than in the freedom
to take advantage of price differentials by shopping across borders.
Price convergence
Price convergence is one of the crucial tests of a unified market. Car
manufacturers have long protested that it has not been achieved because of
currency fluctuations and differences in national taxes and costs. But their
argument is perverse. Only when producers are compelled by strong
cross-border competition to treat Europe as one market will there be
effective pressure to abolish regulatory and fiscal obstacles. That is the
central purpose of the EU single market programme.
The Commission's timid remedies to the obvious flaws in the block exemption
suggest that it is reluctant to subject Europe's biggest manufacturing
sector to the logic of the single market. Its hesitation is not altogether
surprising. For Brussels is itself engaged in the business of using the
exemption to manage trade in cars within the EU.
The exemption provides the Commission with a convenient backdoor way to
limit free trade in Japanese cars between individual EU countries. Brussels
defends these import controls as a necessary evil, insisting that they were
the price for getting governments to agree to open the EU market fully to
competition by 1999.
But the Commission has also paid a heavy price by colluding in such
practices. By doing so, it calls into doubt the sincerity of its commitment
to free competition in the car industry and diminishes its authority to
enforce single market rules on recalcitrant EU member states.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Personal View: Lady who felled the feelgood factor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS COLCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Have you met Naomi - the lady chiefly responsible for the joylessness of the
British recovery? She is the Non-Acceptance Of Minimal Inflation, and she is
currently riding high. No UK British politician, businessman or banker can
afford to ignore her.
Naomi is the problem of transition from life with inflation to life without
it. Three lots of people embody her: those who dislike the idea that
inflation is dead, those who do not believe that its death will last, and
those who cannot believe they have killed it. Together they are smothering
the feelgood factor the government so desires.
The first group fondly remembers the ingredients of inflationary happiness.
The 10 per cent pay rises that were a sham but sounded good down at the pub.
The misleadingly generous interest on deposit accounts. The mortgage debt
that was always covered by the rise in house prices, even though part of it
was blown in local showrooms. The banks that liked to say Yes, and whose
endowments of interest-free deposits minted them profits when interest rates
were at crisis levels.
These nostalgic Naomis will moan more loudly as the joyless recovery
continues. With the job market improving, their ingrained conviction that a
pay offer of less than 5 per cent is a slap in the face will be restored -
the nurses are leading the way. The failure of the great housing escalator
to roll will be missed more and more by would-be trader-uppers and all who
profit from their dealings. This group shares an unstated instinct - that
low inflation blocks social mobility, favours the haves and is basically
reactionary.
The disbelievers note the political power of the first group. International
investors have shifted the British yield curve, as shown, to reflect their
disbelief that the fashion for non-inflationary government will last. Look
at the way expected inflation, which dominates long-term interest rates, has
jumped this year. Businessmen still seek returns of 18 per cent on new
factories: they have not adjusted to non-inflationary times, so their
investment is stingy. Would-be house-sellers sit tight: whether trapped by
'negative equity' or not, they cannot believe their rightful gains will not
come.
These faithless Naomis eye western Europe's persistent unemployment and
public debt, and know the old world is going through a wrenching process of
disillusionment about what labour rights its employers can afford and what
social benefits its governments can afford. They know it is easier to
disguise both problems with inflation and devaluation than to face up to
them explicitly. They know Britain's household debt-to-income ratio, the
highest in Europe at more than 100 per cent, begs for inflationary relief.
Recovery or no recovery, they are damn sure the soft option will prevail.
Cue the entry of Naomi Clarke, Naomi George and Naomi Pennant-Rea. These
killjoys - chancellor, and Bank of England governor and his deputy - are
determined to nip inflation in the bud even if it takes a microscope to find
it. They are closing the bar before the party has even started. Well-meaning
Naomis they, but they complete the dismal picture. The pleasures of
inflation have gone. The pleasures of non-inflation have not yet come. And
the monetary pain of moving from one to the other is not yet over.
Will three-headed Naomi drive Britain back into its bad old ways? The bond
markets say Yes. But I say No, precisely because of the shrillness with
which the markets are speaking. Today's free, worldwide capital movements
have silently removed the inflationary option from any individual
government; they sack the offending bond market at the first sign of
temptation. Naomi will finally expire - perhaps after bringing down the
government that raised her.

Close-knit family, the Kennedys, even when divorcing. Joan Kennedy has just

She hasn't said why, and nor will her lawyer, Monroe Inker, say if the two
have met recently. 'I have been sworn to silence by my client,' says Inker.
Can it be that Kennedy, who has been a Democrat senator for 32 years, is

No shortage of readers willing to point out the obvious error in yesterday's
FT interview with Templeton's Mark Mobius, one of the world's hottest fund
managers. Mobius, a big picture merchant, said that he had been lured to
Russia because of its achievements, such as putting people on the moon.
As every schoolboy knows, it was the Americans who put men on the moon (12
at last count) and the Russians had to make do with a robot called Lunokhod.
Mobius quickly corrected himself, but the comment has prompted stinging
comments from envious rivals.
Alastair Begg, Kleinwort Benson's chief investment manager, shot off a
letter to the FT saying that if someone as skilled as
Mobius is being carried away by such Russian hype, the 'time has come to
sell short'.
'They would say that, wouldn't they?' says Mobius, too polite to mention
that such cynical views are not going to help Kleinwort Benson's own efforts
to sell shares in Gazprom, Russia's largest gas producer, to overseas
investors.

Sales of Billary have already reduced the debt by Dollars 15,000 so far, a

<TEXT>
What's wrong with Norwich? It's some months since Mike Sandland, 56, Norwich
Union's chief investment manager for the past eight years, let it be known
that he was taking early retirement after 33 years on the investment
treadmill. He has now quit and his job is yet to be filled.
Admittedly, Norwich Union has had its ups and downs, but the job of managing
Pounds 33bn must be one of the plums in the UK fund management business. An
added bonus is that it took Sandland just seven minutes to get to work, and
that was on a bad day. In the US any number of fund managers would exchange
the daily grind of commuting into Wall Street for life in a pleasant place
like Norwich. By contrast, there still seems to be a school of thought in
England that serious fund managers work in the City of London and not the
provinces. Perhaps Norwich Union will have to recruit a Scot after all.

Not normally given to metaphorical flourishes, Chris Patten excelled himself
yesterday.
In a lengthy policy speech, the governor of Hong Kong opined that its final
1,000 days under British rule were not at all the same thing as the last
1,000 days of Hong Kong per se. Patten concluded: 'The sun sets, and the sun
rises.'
What exactly did he mean? Some imagined the metaphor might have wider
application - sunset UK, etc, etc - but Patten hastily scotched that idea,
though he struggled to find examples of sunrise UK.
Inspiration eventually dawned, albeit from an unlikely source. 'I'm sure
that those who are meeting in - er - Blackpool this week (where the Labour
party has been staging its annual hand-wringing binge) would not like to
think of setting suns.'
Patten finally had to admit the metaphor didn't work. Piquant, isn't it,
that he will be leaving his office at midnight?

FT  06 OCT 94 / Observer: Stumbling on the stubble
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oh no - yet more adverts of perfectly contoured male clones, all with skin
smoother than a baby's bottom.
Yes, it's another new razor from Gillette, inventor of the original
twin-bladed disposable razor. Remember that? The one which boasted: 'The
first blade shaves you close, the second blade shaves you closer still.'
Most people wondered: if the first blade was so good, why have the second?
What the media really wanted to see when the new Gillette SensorExcel was
displayed in the US this week was Ron Rossi, Gillette's north America
president, sporting a mite of lavatory paper stuck to a nastily nicked chin.
No chance. Instead hacks were served up marketing hype, such as the new
razor's rubber microfins, which stretch the skin and make it stand to
attention for the cutting. Yawn. SensorExcel costs 15 per cent more than any
other throwaway plastic razor.
For that, we expect aftershave lotion chucked in too.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MR MICHAEL JACKAMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest the article by Andrew Taylor highlighting the
problems of obtaining empty premises as temporary winter shelter for the
homeless ('Shelter is sought for winter homeless', September 28). Allied
Domecq (formerly Allied-Lyons) was very glad to have been able to provide
some accommodation for this scheme over the past couple of years. Indeed, we
very much regret that we are unable to do so again in 1994.
I recognise that many companies may have misgivings about lending their
premises for such a project. However, I can assure them that the shelter at
our premises was extremely well organised and any problems in making the
building habitable were minimised with help from Crash (Construction
Industry Relief &amp; Assistance for the Single Homeless).
I would urge the leaders of business in London to trawl their organisations
to find suitable premises that can be offered for this deserving scheme. If
anyone wishes to learn more about our experience, I would be delighted to
hear from them.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Share options debate confuses
separate issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID TUCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There is a danger in the current debate on executive share options of
confusing three separate but distinct issues.
First there is the 'value' of the option at the time it is granted. In
theory this should be a measure which reflects how much a third party would
be willing to pay for the option. Most valuation models rely on making
certain assumptions about the company which, arguably, means at best they
produce a theoretical value, there being no market in executive options.
Second, there is the benefit which the executive obtains if and when he
exercises his option. 'Headline' figures often overlook the fact that the
executive will only benefit if shareholders also benefit. The raison d'etre
of options is to enable the holder to benefit from an increase in share
price without having, initially, to purchase shares. Provided the executive
is granted an option over an 'appropriate' value of shares, then the real
question is what performance target should be attained before the option can
be exercised. Our survey of quoted companies, results of which will be
published shortly, will provide insight into this area. The size of the gain
should simply reflect how successful the executives are in creating value
for shareholders.
The third issue is the cost to the company and the shareholders. This is
where the real confusion starts. If the option is never exercised, there
will be no cost. Similarly, to assume the cost is the gain on exercise
assumes that the marketplace accurately adjusts the price of shares to
reflect the dilution. It also ignores any possibility that the very granting
of the option might increase a company's value.
The debate should be whether options are the most appropriate method of
offering an incentive to executives to increase shareholder value. The
increasing use of restricted share schemes suggests that options are not the
only solution.

<TEXT>
Inside Richard Branson's Business Empire By Tim Jackson Harper Collins,
Pounds 17.50, 383 pages
When Richard Branson, the founder of the Virgin group, was preparing to
cross the Atlantic in a hot air balloon in 1987, he came across a television
station's video monitor running his obituary.
The station was demonstrating no more than prudence: the Atlantic crossing
almost ended in disaster when Branson's balloon ditched in the sea off
Ireland.
Branson, 44, has since forsworn dangerous sports, and the obituaries spawned
by his penchant for life-threatening exploits remain in the archives.
Few of them, in any case, would have offered great insight into the private
Branson. Tim Jackson, a journalist who writes for the Independent, has tried
to fill the gap with a book that attempts to answer the question: what is
Richard Branson really like?
The principal facts of Branson's business life are well-known: he created
one of the world's leading music companies, which he later sold for Pounds
560m; an airline, Virgin Atlantic, which attracted much attention; and
several other businesses, including a worldwide record retailing chain.
More difficult to capture are the many contradictions that surround him. Of
the three young British entrepreneurs who rose to great prominence during
the 1980s - the others being Alan Sugar of Amstrad and Anita Roddick of Body
Shop - Branson remains the most difficult to understand.
Sugar trod the path from Jewish working class to entrepreneurial success
which many others had walked before. Roddick is currently fighting off
allegations that she has not lived up to the ideals that motivated her and
her company. There has never been any doubt, however, what those ideals are:
respect for the natural environment and for human rights, and opposition to
cruelty to animals.
What motivates Branson has never been clear. He seems to embody the
libertarian ideals of the 1960s, appearing in the most august company
without a tie. He lived on a houseboat and promoted the sale of condoms. Yet
he was a favourite of Margaret Thatcher.
His talent for publicity is notorious. He launched his airline dressed in an
old-fashioned leather flying helmet and goggles. He submitted his
unsuccessful application to run the UK national lottery in the company of a
horse.
Yet for all the apparent love of attention, the private Branson finds it
difficult to look people in the eye. He is surprisingly inarticulate. If the
idea were not so ludicrous, one would think he was shy.
Tim Jackson's book is filled with such puzzles.
Branson has used his vast wealth to buy a Caribbean island. He flew a pair
of Balinese craftsmen to his Oxfordshire home to build a cricket pavilion in
the style of a traditional temple. Yet Branson seemed not to notice that the
paint was flaking off the back of his Holland Park home.
When Branson decided to cross the Pacific in a balloon, he paid Pounds
87,000 for Shinto priests to bless it before departure. But he quibbled with
Per Lindstrand, who piloted the balloon, over a bill for Pounds 150.
The book has its rough edges. The collapse of Air Europe is thrown into the
narrative without any explanation for the non-expert reader of its
relevance. Jackson recounts a row about the Social Democratic party between
Branson and a dinner guest, but frustratingly omits to say which side
Branson took.
Overall, however, it is an admirable biography. Parts make gripping reading:
the balloon expeditions, the struggle to establish the airline and British
Airways's dirty tricks campaign against it.
But does it bring us any closer to the real Branson? We understand his
business style better by the end: his determination to make new ideas work
and his need to move on to something else when they have. As to the person,
the conclusion has to be that there is no resolving the contradictions: they
are part of the man.
What is clear is that, if anyone is going to explain who Branson is, Branson
would prefer to be the one who does it. One of the reasons he took the group
private after floating it on the London Stock Exchange was that he disliked
having what he saw as ill-informed stockbrokers' analysts commenting on it.
He initially refused to co-operate in the writing of this book. When Jackson
decided to go ahead anyway, however, Branson met him for long and detailed
interviews and encouraged his friends and colleagues to do the same.
According to Jackson, Branson later changed his mind and decided the book
would be biased against him. Branson was then offered the chance to read the
manuscript and correct mistakes, on condition that he did not send his
lawyers in afterwards.
Branson's solicitors told him to reject this offer. As Jackson makes clear,
Branson always pays for the best legal advice. Any lawyer who advised him to
waive his right to legal action before he knew whether the book contained
anything defamatory would not be worth his fee.
There is much for him to dislike in this book. Some youthful indiscretions,
including a near-prosecution by the Customs &amp; Excise, are not new. More
hurtful will be the views of Virgin Music employees who worked for the
company for years, but had no shares to cash in when it was sold.
Yet Jackson clearly admires Branson for his energy, his originality and his
regard for people often ignored by other business leaders: women, clerks,
cleaners, customers.
Jackson's conclusion that, despite Branson's apparent lack of political
convictions, he could emerge as a British Berlusconi, appears to be a lapse
from his usual sceptical standards of judgment. But then the sceptics
sneered at the idea that anyone could get an airline flying four months
after being presented with the idea - and that is exactly what Branson did.

Sir, I note ('Universities plan business links', September 30) that the

As someone who has worked in industrial R&amp;D, I suggest that, in addition to

Sir, Colin Amery warns us against architectural competitions ('The tyranny

country where a 'new' building is still a supermarket parading as an oast
house, usually close to a (genuinely) new motorway.
Two of the projects he warns against, the reorganisation of the South Bank
and the redesign of a disused power station for a new Tate Gallery, are in
the English tradition of conversion and adjustment. In a culture devoted to
back extensions and knocking through I imagined Amery would have admired the
inherent modesty of these two projects. Instead, he seems afraid of their
possible modernity. Oh England]

FT  06 OCT 94 / Helicopter makers in a spin: The fierce international
competition to win a large UK defence order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British army's plans for a new fleet of attack helicopters have
generated the competition of the decade for the world's aerospace
manufacturers.
The Pounds 2bn order for 91 helicopters - to be decided next spring - is
likely to be the largest helicopter purchase in the world for at least the
next five years.
As the UK Ministry of Defence last week took final bids for the order, it
was shaping up as a fierce contest between some of the world's largest
aerospace companies. The winning bid will be expected to offer a fixed price
for the contract and assurances that much of the work will go to UK
industry.
Military planners in the US, and now in Britain, see attack helicopters as
essential to the armed forces of the future, with tanks and helicopters
becoming the main battle zone weapons.
A new fleet of attack helicopters, now the British army's highest priority,
will allow high mobility and flexibility of response from bases at the rear
of battle zones to targets far behind enemy lines.
Attack helicopters established their value in the Gulf war. McDonnell
Douglas, the US aircraft manufacturer, proudly boasts that its Apache attack
helicopter fired the first shots in the allied attack on Iraq, destroying
radar installations to allow stealth fighters to fly unobserved to Baghdad.
In futuristic scenarios, attack helicopters are seen as essential to
protecting British tanks from well-equipped enemy armour. Lurking behind
cover a mile or so from the main action, helicopters will be able to pick up
advancing enemy tanks with their sensors, loose off a salvo of missiles, and
dive for home before the enemy commanders know that they are being watched.
In placing the contract for the UK fleet of helicopters, the MoD is looking
for three characteristics in the winning bid.
First, companies must offer an 'off-the-shelf' product which is already in
service with armed forces elsewhere. This will avoid the time and expense of
developing an attack helicopter specifically for the UK.
Second, bidders must agree a fixed price for the contract, so that the risk
of cost overruns is born by the contractor rather than the taxpayer.
Third, potential suppliers will be expected to place as much of the work on
the helicopters in the UK as possible. As well as proving the military worth
and cost-effectiveness of their products, bidders have to outline what level
of involvement UK industry will have in production.
Four main competitors are attempting to win the contract.
The favourite is the Apache, some 800 of which are already in service with
the US army. With its proven service record and firepower, it is the
helicopter favoured by the British army.
A large helicopter, Apache can carry a heavy load of anti-tank missiles. It
will be equipped with the new sophisticated Longbow radar, which is
currently under development by US defence companies Martin Marietta and
Westinghouse. Longbow allows the pilot to identify a target such as a tank
from cover, lock a missile on to the target, and move away as soon as it is
fired.
The Apache bid is led by Westland, the only UK helicopter manufacturer.
Westland would make the helicopter - and bear the risks of the fixed-price
contract - under licence from McDonnell Douglas.
Westland's chairman, Mr Alan Jones, says that more than half of the Pounds
2bn contract will be placed directly with British companies. The Apache team
would also place a further Pounds 1bn of contracts on other aerospace
projects as indirect 'offset' work with UK industry.
The main European competitor is the Tiger, designed by the Franco-German
Eurocopter group. Tiger is a lighter helicopter than the Apache and is still
under development for the French and German armies. Its main armament is the
Trigat anti-tank missile, developed by Britain, France and Germany.
British Aerospace is the main UK participant in the Tiger bid. If the bid
succeeds, BAe will get 20 per cent of construction work for all the 500
Tigers expected to be sold in Europe. BAe claims that this, combined with
the value of its contribution to the Trigat missile, would bring
high-technology work for British companies worth more than the full value of
the attack helicopter fleet.
The company also says that the Tiger's new design means that it will have
much lower running costs than its competitors, which are based on older
technologies.
The other large UK defence contractor, GEC, is also fielding a bid. Its
candidate is Venom, an updated version of the Cobra, a veteran of the
Vietnam war built by Bell, another US helicopter manufacturer.
It, too, is a light helicopter, acknowledged by GEC as offering less in
performance than the Apache. But Venom has cost on its side: a Venom
helicopter may be only two-thirds the price of an Apache and, says GEC, it
will be substantially cheaper to run.
The wild card in the competition is the South African Rooivalk, made by
Denel, a subsidiary of Atlas, the state-owned arms manufacturer. Rooivalk
entered the competition late, and was not taken seriously at first. However,
its brute strength means that it can carry heavy loads and has won admirers.
The aerospace company Marshalls of Cambridge would act as prime contractor
for the UK.
Plenty of mud has been slung in the fight to win the UK contract.
Opponents of the Apache say that it has proved expensive to maintain in the
past and that the US government will not share details of the
state-of-the-art Longbow radar with the UK.
The Tiger is criticised for being too light for the job, as expensive to buy
as the Apache and of unproven technology. The Venom airframe is said to be
too old, while development work on a new cockpit leaves its real cost
uncertain.
Rooivalk, meanwhile, is also based on an ageing design and comes from a
country which is going through enormous political change. The MoD will want
to be certain that the order can be completed and maintainance continued
over the life of the fleet.
Despite their competing merits, the Apache remains the hot favourite. The
large number in service with the US army and the heavy weapons load it can
carry argue strongly in its favour.
Politically, it may also be attractive. Giving the order to Westland, which
is based in the south-west of England, might help Conservative MPs defend
their seats against the advance of the Liberal Demo-crats.
Even the Apache's main drawback, cost, may be reduced by the pressure of
competitive bidding. Westland - like all the bidders - will have to provide
the MoD with extensive guarantees capping the maintainance costs of the
aircraft.
There is, however, one obstacle that could trip up the Apache. The UK is
currently holding another competition to replace the RAF's ageing fleet of
Hercules transport aircraft. This involves a bitter battle between Lockheed,
the US manufacturer of the latest generation of Hercules, and BAe, which is
offering the Airbus-produced Future Large Aircraft.
If the MoD buys the Lockheed Hercules as it originally wanted, there will be
a huge outcry from the UK manufacturers about buying American rather than
European equipment. To soften the blow, the MoD might be tempted to award
the attack helicopter to the European Tiger.
That would not please Westland, and would not be the outcome BAe was looking
for either.
'My feeling,' said one executive involved in the competition, 'is that
buying Hercules and Apache will be one American purchase too many for the
MoD.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr THOMAS FLANNIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I disagree with your editorial, 'Back from the brink' (October 3) - in
the wake of yet another agreement that purports to open Japan's markets -
where you urge Japan to 'table this weekend's concessions to the Gatt'. You
also tell Japan to 'demand that the US seek to resolve any future bilateral
trade differences through negotiation in the World Trade Organisation'.
The US has hauled Japan before the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
three times in the last six years, and won each time. Japan has simply
ignored the rulings, and pursued a ruthlessly protectionist trade policy,
bolstered by the cheers of many English publications, including your
newspaper. It is curious that you should constantly side with Japan and urge
the US to seek a remedy that has proved to be worthless.
Japan has 'opened' its market dozens of times, but it still keeps the
foreigners out, and laughs all the way to the bank. Japan's strategy is to
keep the US talking and talking until it is so deeply in debt that it does
not matter what the US says about trade.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A D LEVAGGI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, When the third tranche of British Telecom shares was offered to the
public, priority was given to those investing through a Share Shop.
Those who purchased BT3 in this way (perhaps to augment their holdings in
BT1 and BT2), found themselves locked into a separate nominee share account
from which there is no escape. To sell shares acquired in this way would
involve loss of the share bonus.
The Share Shops offered Pep facilities for BT3 shares without initial
charges, but even the maximum number possible allocated to an individual
hardly made the exercise worthwhile in view of subsequent charges.
The new offer of the remaining electricity generators' shares is through
Share Shops only. Hence, existing holders of National Power and PowerGen
shares (as well as new investors) will find themselves lumbered with
holdings in two unwanted nominee share accounts from which, again, there
will be no escape.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Arts: A 'Giselle' of integrity - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fighting the good dance fight, London City Ballet has embarked upon its
autumn schedule of touring round the country. Denied the full subvention
from the Arts Council that its work and its attainments should merit, LCB
goes indomitably on. It is sustained for this season by ADT, which deserves
the thanks of those many audiences - LCB gives about 200 shows each year,
vastly more than certain other funded troupes - who would otherwise not see
ballet.
I admire LCB for its terrier-like persistence, but even more because its
performances are so whole-hearted. The repertory is middle-brow, but then,
so is much of its public. Its productions are not articles of grand luxe,
but wild expenditure has little merit, as we know from some of the Royal
Ballet's extravagant mishaps. (Remember Cyrano and Don Quixote). LCB strives
to give its public the best that wit and necessary cheese-paring ('blessed
poverty' said Karsavina of Rambert stagings in its earliest days) can
provide. The result - as I saw in the Giselle, which is this autumn's
touring fare - is pleasing.
The staging is by Galina Samsova, made for the company nearly a decade ago.
It is sound, un-pretending, telling the story and honouring the old
choreography with decorum. Peter Farmer's setting is sensitive, and in the
well-lit forest-scene, properly mysterious. Reduced for an ensemble of 35
dancers, the drama is honestly set out, and the supporting roles are played
with an integrity that some larger companies might envy. (Beverly Jane Fry
is a fine Bathilde, charming,
but aware of her nobility; Gary Shuker is a Hilarion who wins our sympathy.)
Standards of dancing are variable,
but nothing is cheated. And in Kim Miller, whose interpretation I saw on
Tuesday night, LCB has a remarkable Giselle.
I reported on Miss Miller's debut in the role when this production was new.
We now see a performer of beautiful and mature artistry. She has always been
an expressive dance-actress, thrown to the wolves on occasion, as in the mad
Traviata that LCB produced a few years ago, but true in whatever she has
done. As Giselle, her every best gift is used. The first act peasant is
trusting, gentle, her gaze ever turned to Loys (the sincere and credible
Roger van Fleteren). Betrayal brings pain that is like his sword to her
heart - this Giselle is piteous as she turns in accusation on Loys/Albrecht
 -and then comes madness, shown by Miss Miller with absolute and absolutely
touching clarity.
Her performance is the motor force of the piece, and she makes the Romantic
fervours of the second act very lovely. Physically, she has the melting
arms, the softness of phrasing, that were so fascinating with Lynn Seymour
in this role, and as with Seymour, everything she does has meaning. Her
Wili-Giselle is a study in compassion set in long, creamy sequences of
movement. The variation was exquisite in shape - the outline of the foot and
the musical lift to the steps its especial distinction. The duet (van
Fleteren a devoted partner) was emotionally and physically true. Miss Miller
is a Giselle of real authority and real grace.
I liked Roger van Fleteren's Albrecht, and I liked him most as he responded
to his Giselle in the second act - the old story became urgent again. The
attendant wilis were well-schooled. The performance, and here is the value
of LCB's policies, stimulated and delighted its audience. Giselle is given
with a neo-classic curtain-raiser, Vincent Redmon's Counterbalance. It
involves two Vivaldi violin concerti, and steps as scratchily active. The
cast look as if they are trapped in a spin-dryer.
London City Ballet is in Bromley until the end of this week, then tours to
High Wycombe, Croydon, Brighton until the end of November with Giselle.
Sponsorship for the year is given by ADT.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Arts: Less classical than sitcom: the RSC's 'Ion' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN SHUTTLEWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To the classical Greeks, 'comedy' simply meant any play which ended more or
less harmoniously - without any high-born corpses or divine condemnations to
speak of. Actual humour didn't come into it. To stage such drama in the
present day is to walk a perilous line between the nature of the original
material and current expectations of the genre.
The two first-ever professional English-language productions of Euripides'
play opened this month. In a fortnight, the Actors Touring Company stages
Kenneth McLeish's translation in Cardiff prior to a national tour, but first
out of the traps is the director-translator partnership of Nicholas Wright
and David Lan for the Royal Shakespeare Company.
Euripides' world view was far from clear cut: to him, morality shifted with
changing circumstances and the gods had their own agenda, to which men and
women were as flies to wanton boys.
One cannot help thinking that Wright and Lan's version of Ion would
perversely appeal to the old boy, founded as it is on the notion that
momentous events - a liaison between the god Apollo and a mortal woman,
leading to the foundation of virtually the entire Greek race - can be
recounted in the trite vocabulary of suburban sitcom.
Jude Law is cleverly cast as the temple servant of Apollo whose reunion with
his mother forms the narrative core of the play. This energetic young man is
not the stuff of legend: one minute he may be musing profoundly, 'if the
gods lie, how can we ever know the truth?', but the next - as a supplicant
to Apollo's oracle has just been misinformed that Ion is his son - he is
sending off over-enthusiastic and apparently suspect attentions with, 'you
wouldn't believe how often I have to put up with this . . . especially from
foreigners'.
As Ion gropes towards the truth of his parentage like a less-fraught
Oedipus, Law conveys the confusion and extremity of emotion without lapsing
into classical angst. He is supported in this tonal no-man's-land by Peter
Guinness as his stepfather Xuthus, an affable cove but not what you would
call blessed with diplomacy.
The women on stage are more unambiguously earnest, but sometimes seem a
little too far gone. When Creusa (Diana Hardcastle) plots the murder of Ion
before discovering that he is her own child, Wright and Lan fail to
integrate the scene's cut-price Medea-isms with the overall dramatic curve
of the play. Also awkward is the presentation of speeches by the
seven-strong chorus of Creusa's maidservants; after a promising beginning as
a kind of Women's Institute tour party, they fall into a habit of what can
best be described as synchronised writhing. Greek choruses are always a
devil to stage in modern productions; suffice it to say that this particular
option is less than triumphant.
However, the dominant note of the production remains its determined
anti-nobility. The gods and their doings are held up not to ridicule but to
chuckles of banal recognition, and Euripides' lines are rendered in a style
not unlike a kind of ancient Athenian Galton &amp; Simpson.

FORREST GUMP (12) Robert Zemeckis
THE LION KING (U) Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff
MINA TANNENBAUM (12) Martine Dugowson
FUNNY MAN (18) Simon Sprackling
Early in Forrest Gump, before its hero has grown into Tom Hanks, he is
chased down a country road by school bullies. The braces on his legs - the
boy is ill-developed physically as well as mentally - suddenly fly apart and
free him to run like a sprinter.
For Forrest Gump read Forrest Gump. This 2 1/2 -hour comedy/fable/history
lesson must once have seemed the most handicapped project on the Hollywood
lot: an epic hobble across post-war America with a holy fool for hero and a
road paved, or potholed, with 40 years of national good intentions and
national seizures (Dallas, Vietnam, Watergate). Our Forrest grows up into an
Alabama Candide: a man around whom great events happen but who remains
blithely unscathed and unimpressed by them all.
Would such a movie play in Peoria? Even the original novel by Winston Groom
only sold 30,000 copies in hardback.
Commercially it has run like the wind: Dollars 270m at the US box office to
date - it may topple Jurassic Park as the highest-earning film in history -
and an entire nation besotted with Gump wit and wisdom. Like its
innocent-messianic hero, who becomes an athlete and spends much of the movie
jogging across the land as a torchbearer-without-torch for the human spirit,
Forrest Gump the film has thrown aside its leg-braces and left footprints
all over Clinton-era America.
Indeed Gump may be Bill Clinton, we (and others) opine. One of several
ingenious trick-optical scenes has the backwoods boy shaking hands with JFK
himself. And surely that was a favourite scene from the Clinton movie
scrapbook too.
But like the man in the White House Forrest Gump spends a deal of time
trying to be all things to all folk. Self-ingratiatingly, and for this
viewer maddeningly, it blends the comic with the Christly, the satirical
with the sentimental, the free-thinking with the fuddy-duddy. When Forrest
overnights at the Watergate Hotel in the early 1970s, after a chat with
Nixon (more state-of-the-art opticals), we chortle approvingly as he becomes
the first man to blow the whistle on the 'plumbers'.
But only minutes before that we are watching him in Vietnam behaving like
John Wayne in The Green Berets. As he runs back and forth through a
napalm-blazing jungle, finally saving unit leader Gary Sinise, a nightmare
war is turned into an arch cameo of Boy's Own heroism. Sinise will adorn the
rest of the movie as a double amputee, providing a support paradigm -
Gloucester to Forrest's Lear - of grace under pressure in millennial
America.
But is it grace or just glamourised gormlessness? 'Stupid is as stupid does'
is one wisdom intoned by Hanks's dogged Southerner - his face puckered in
sage earnestness, his vowels a lugubrious, elastic twang - as he proves that
an IQ of 75 does not disqualify you as the moral hero of a nation.
Accident is destiny, destiny accident: that is the other saw that keeps
buzzing. From the opening credits sequence, in which a feather drifts from
the sky down to Forrest's shoe as he sits on a park bench hijacking
strangers with his life story (a blend of EL Wisty and the Ancient Mariner),
director Robert 'Roger Rabbit' Zemeckis and screenwriter Eric Roth pile on
the haphazard while steering Forrest unerringly towards fulfilment. He gets
to love a woman (Robin Wright), an ex-flower child whom he saves from the
hell of 1960s liberalism. He fathers his own child. He grows rich from the
shrimping business.
He is, we begin to realise, America herself: that dear, untutored land that
redeems itself by its innocence even when it creates tragedy by its
ignorance. This rose-tinted mirror held up to the USA by the USA says, 'If
we have never truly grown up - never do grow up - nothing can truly be our
fault.' If sentimentality were a crime, Forrest Gump would be put away for
life. As it is, it will probably be with us for life: the ultimate feel-good
film in an age when no one any longer has the courage to feel bad.
Moviegoing in late-summer America has been a dangerous activity. Turn away
from the idiot savant on the park bench and you will walk straight into the
jaws of The Lion King (Dollars 250m and climbing).
But this option is more fun. Disney's new animation feature is its first
ever based on an original screenplay and has a real freshness of setting and
vision. The African wilderness shimmers across the wide screen - do not wait
for the video - as the orphaned lion prince Simba grows up to dethrone his
wicked uncle Scar (voiced by Jeremy Irons) who had his regal father run over
in a wildebeest stampede.
We are all run over by this wildebeest stampede. From where I sat it started
in the north-west speaker, surged down the side aisle, roared over the
Empire screen towards Leicester Square, then rumbled out in the south-west
speaker. Spectacle matches sound: thousands of dust-raising shapes shaking
the desert as the camerawork soars and curvettes overhead.
The sequence lasts 2 1/2 minutes and took two years to create. Jeremy
Irons's voice for Scar probably took two hours and is just as splendid: a
wicked George Sanders purr sliding up and down the scale of sarcasm like a
cat on a polished bannister.
The film loses its magic towards the end, with a gaudy, hurried showdown. We
miss the burnished charm with which the film sauntered round its early
scenes. Here - and in the middle section where a hip meerkat and doleful
wart-hog keep Simba company in the paradise valley of his exile - The Lion
King matches the comical and painterly bravura of the great Disney cartoons.
Is there such a thing a feel-bad film today? Mina Tannenbaum ought to
qualify, but by some proprietary charm formula fails to do so.
Mina (Romane Bohringer) is a plain, introverted Jewish girl, tormented by
not having her best friend Ethel's vibrant social graces. Ethel (Elsa
Zylberstein), also Jewish, is tormented because she does not have painter
Mina's depth and artistic talent.
Stir in two passive-aggressive Jewish mothers - adding gall to a stew
steeped in wormwood - and you have this drama of interconnecting female
lives, bubbling and spitting across two caustically observed decades.
Screenwriter Veronique Heuchenne and director Martine Dugowson make
sardonically merry with the fashions of the 1970s: floor-sweeping trouser
bottoms and hats like floppy stovepipes. Then they make menacing with the
greedy 1980s, when ambition and love rivalry pulls the girlfriends apart.
We could cry 'Woman's picture' and complain that emotion swamps action and
that the men are pawns in a parable of sisterhood. But after the runaway
patriarchalism of Forrest Gump and The Lion King - where woman's sole
function is to be mettle-polisher to the dominant male - Mina Tannenbaum is
a welcome reminder that half the planet has its own mind and will and hand
on destiny's tiller.
Funny Man, a British horror comedy from first-time writer-director Simon
Sprackling, is the week's booby prize. If you ever win a round of poker from
Christopher Lee, make sure you do not accept his forfeit of an ancestral
home. It contains a homicidal 'joker' (Tim James, putty-faced up to resemble
a Jimmy Savile from hell) whose delight is picturesquely to murder you and
your friends.
Sliced heads; pierced eyeballs; electrocution; burning. All the fun of the
auto-da-fe. And between murders the film returns to its normal idling state:
a benighted, terminal catatonia. Wait for the video. And then keep waiting.

Those deprived folk who wonder why people get so excited about cars might
catch a whiff of what it is all about on Top Gear (BBC2, 8.30), in which the
ever-opinionated Jeremy Clarkson gets to play with some USDollars 4m worth
of some of the most beautiful cars ever made - the three Bat cars created
for Alfa Romeo by Franco Scaglione in the 1950s. On a less exalted level,
Quentin Willson looks at the market for second-hand Mazda MX-5s.
A riveting plot-within-a-plot unravels in the course of Critical Eye:
Angleterre Underground (Channel 4, 9.00), a documentary following a group of
New Age travellers. Relations between the French-Polish film director Edward
Porembny and his crew became so strained that they, rather than the original
subject, become the film's chief point of interest. Post-modern or what?
Poets will be popping up throughout the day on BBC2 as part of that
channel's celebration of National Poetry Day, which makes a change from the
charmless banter of smarmy announcers; Roger McGough hosts the climax to the
festivities in Poets Win Prizes (BBC2, 7.20).

FT  06 OCT 94 / Technology: Front row seat - In-flight interactive TV is
coming to a 747 near you
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES JENNINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Depending on whom you believe, interactive in-flight television is either
with us, about to be with us, or still so lost in the planning stage that no
one can be sure when it will arrive.
Interactive TV will mean the end of the communal screen and the tyranny of
the in-flight movie by offering passengers a choice of viewing on individual
video screens.
It will also mean a new source of revenue for airlines, which will be able
to charge economy class passengers an extra fee to watch the latest films or
play computer games.
It will also tempt passengers to do their duty-free shopping by choosing
items from the screen and paying for them with a credit card swipe device
rather than calling the flight attendant.
This opens up a new world of in-flight possibilities. Satellite data links
will enable passengers to book hotel rooms, hire cars and send flowers;
airlines will be able to use interactive screens to run instant customer
surveys; passengers will be able to look up information about their
destination; and video on demand will be a reality, with passengers
selecting the programmes they want to watch, when they want to watch them.
Virgin Atlantic and United Airlines are both working on basic video
interactivity. In Virgin's case, this means a Pounds 12m system designed by
Hughes Avicom of California, which can provide 14 TV channels, plus video
roulette, poker and fruit machine games and duty-free shopping with a credit
card swipe.
United Airlines is developing a similar set-up using hardware provided by
GEC/Marconi (at a cost of Pounds 65m) and software by Microsoft and Sony.
Six TV channels, duty-free shopping and electronic games will be the main
interactive ingredients when the facility appears on United's new Boeing 777
fleet some time next year.
Virgin's system is already operating. Installed in six of its 12 aircraft
earlier this year, it has not been without teething troubles; but it is at
least there, rather than merely promised.
Tests on British Airways' new in-flight system are not due to be held until
early 1995, and installation throughout the fleet will have to wait until
the end of that year. But BA argues that its system will offer the full
range of interactive video facilities, not just some of them.
It will take time because BA - and any other airline hoping to offer a range
of facilities of this complexity - will have to use the latest
high-performance hard disc digital servers to process the vast quantities of
information.
Digital servers are at the heart of it all. Their job is to parcel out
material to each user as he or she wants it, remember which user is where in
the programme and give him or her the right bits of material at the right
moment.
A server system must be able to cope with all users choosing the same
programme simultaneously as well as at different times (a digitised,
compressed movie takes up about one gigabyte of hard disc for every hour of
screen time), and be fault tolerant so that it can continue to deliver
material even if a drive fails.
It must also be light and compact enough to fit into an aircraft, and must
avoid high operating temperatures.
BE Aerospace of Irvine, California, is designing the BA aircraft
installations, each one comprising four hard drive servers, with each hard
drive holding 90 gigabytes of information. Other servers will be needed to
handle such services as games, car hire and hotel information.
BA estimates that fully installed, the technology will cost around Pounds
80m. Every system will add about 2 tonnes to an aircraft's payload.
It is clear that this is not something that BA wants to rush into. In which
case, will Singapore Airlines steal BA's thunder?
SIA is being coy about its plans, announcing, like Virgin and United, that
the new year will see them offering a mix of fixed-schedule TV channels,
destination information and catalogue shopping, and some games.
SIA is widely believed to have struck a deal with Micropolis, a
California-based information storage and video systems company. Micropolis's
claim to fame is that it has been supplying video on demand to hotels in the
US for the past six months, using its own digital video server, the AV
Server 100.
This is up and running in seven US hotels and already allows up to 32
viewers simultaneous access to 20 films. The technology can be tailored for
airline use without having to compromise the equipment's basic
specification.
Singapore Airlines may be at least six months ahead of the pack and possibly
more.
But this is not the end of it. Everyone is talking about using interactive
video principally to access pre-recorded material, downloaded on to the
aircraft before it takes off. But there will soon be the option of picking
up digital quality live TV and other real-time information on an aircraft in
flight - as demonstrated earlier this year, when a Swissair aircraft picked
up a live CNN broadcast on a flight from Tokyo to Zurich.
This looked like a stunt: the broadcast was short and the capability to
repeat the exercise is limited. But it is there, promising live news
broadcasts, weather checks for your destination and all the local television
viewing you can handle at 30,000ft.
This raises a further point: how much TV should an airline allow for, before
the quality starts to evaporate? That may prove to be a tougher problem than
all the technology put together.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Technology: Phone users box clever - A device that offers UK
long-distance callers new choice and new services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Energis, the new UK long-distance phone company, launched its network
last week it gave pride of place to two small boxes, one for residential
consumers and the other for small businesses. These will make it easier for
BT customers to switch to an alternative supplier as well as offering a
range of services that Energis claims are new to the market.
For residential customers there is an Energis Box, 14cm by 8.5cm. Like a
personal computer modem, the cable from the box fits into a standard BT
phone socket at one end and a standard telephone at the other. All
long-distance calls made from the phone are automatically routed across the
Energis network, while local calls continue to travel via BT.
This makes Energis simpler to access than Mercury, although the new company
concedes that Mercury remains cheaper for some calls. With Mercury, the
standard modes of access for residential customers are a blue button phone
or prefixing long-distance numbers with the code 132.
The Energis box, however, can be fitted in seconds.
For small businesses, Energis has a multiline box for customers taking at
least four lines. This routes all national calls over the Energis network
and records all telephone use. Customers receive a monthly report that lists
not only outgoing calls, but also the time taken to answer the phone by
hourly averages, and the number of calls lost.
The multiline box is fitted by an Energis engineer. For customers with a
branch exchange it will probably take the form of some software fitted
directly on to the exchange.
The telephone management report facility made available by the multiline box
is a first as a standard phone service for the small business. It is likely
to be of great value to organisations as they plan their phone management. A
recent report by the Audit Commission, the public sector watchdog, indicated
that local authorities had reduced the unanswered calls to less than half as
a result of telephone monitoring reports.
Many small businesses probably have no idea how many calls they are missing,
let alone how long it takes them to answer the phone.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Technology: The missing link - German researchers are
helping US companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's Fraunhofer institutes, which provide an important research link
between universities and companies, are following industry's lead and moving
into the export market.
The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft (organisation), the largest applied research
body in Germany, has set up a US offshoot to work with universities and help
local companies develop advanced industrial technologies. It is also looking
at ventures in south-east Asia.
Fraunhofer USA is the first foreign unit of the German organisation, which
has a research volume of DM1bn (Pounds 420m) and employs nearly 8,000 people
in 46 institutes.
'We took this step because economies are becoming more and more
interlinked,' says Hans-Jurgen Warnecke, president of
Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft.
US technology experts say that despite the country's academic and
technological resources, the transfer of technologies from universities for
industrial use is limited. As in Germany, much of the efforts of Fraunhofer
USA will be directed at smaller companies, with a strong emphasis on
manufacturing.
'We want to work with the Fraunhofer model in the US because it has clearly
proved to be a great help in promoting innovation in small and medium-sized
companies,' says John McTague, vice-president for technical affairs at Ford
Motor Company and head of Fraunhofer USA's national advisory council, which
met for the first time this week. United Technologies, Du Pont and BMW North
America are also represented on the council.
Fraunhofer USA has its headquarters in Michigan, near the motor industry,
which it expects to be an important client. One Fraunhofer institute, for
computer graphics research, set up a laboratory in Rhode Island ahead of the
foundation of the new US unit.
Fraunhofer USA has been given three years to gather enough contracts to pay
its way. Until then, it will be financed by the parent company in Germany,
which draws its funds from government, public sector and industrial research
contracts.
