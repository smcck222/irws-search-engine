FT  06 OCT 94 / Technology: Japan rocks steady

<TEXT>
The Great Buddha of Kamakura was little moved by this week's earthquake in
Japan. The 40ft statue on the outskirts of Tokyo rests on steel shock
absorbers on a granite base, allowing it to move with the tremor.
Like the Buddha of Kamakura, many Japanese buildings today have special
foundations which absorb tremors and allow the structures to dissipate quake
energy by swaying. These devices include bearings made of rubber and steel,
or layered steel and rubber between the building and its foundations.
This technology is used mainly in structures under 200m high. 'Buildings
taller than 30 storeys are able to move with the earthquake,' says Yuichiro
Ogawa, who manages Shimizu Construction's structural technology division.
The problem for designers now is to deal with the effects of swaying. The
36-storey Kasumigaseki building in central Tokyo, built in 1968, was the
first high-rise to include 'soft structure' technology, allowing the
building's beams and pillars to vibrate with the quake. Further
technological advances have led to skyscrapers more than 200m tall, but
their flexibility means that strong winds and typhoons sway them to an
uncomfortable degree, causing symptoms similar to seasickness and making
high-rises unsuitable for residential use.
This has been eased by computerised vibration control systems. Strong winds
cause computers to activate a large rectangular weight, supported by four
pillars made of layers of rubber which move in the opposite direction to the
building's movements. Shimizu's system - the first to be installed in a
skyscraper of more than 200m, two years ago - passed its first big test in
last week's typhoon, the strongest to hit western Japan this year. Other
companies have developed and installed similar systems.
Shimizu said that the usual degree of fluctuation was reduced by two-thirds.
Occupants of the building's apartments and hotel reported feeling hardly any
swaying despite strong gusts of wind.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Malcolm Le May, 36, co-head of BZW's US merchant banking business, is
returning to London and joining UBS to head its European corporate finance
team.
Le May, an accountant who has worked for Drexel Burnham Lambert Securities
and Morgan Grenfell, joined BZW four years ago and moved to New York early
last year as co-head of merchant banking in New York. His departure comes
only a few months after BZW appointed Ian Peacock, 46, who had been 19 years
with Kleinwort Benson, as the other co-head of merchant banking in NY.
UBS, which claims to rank in the top five for all Euro-equity related
issues, has around 140 people involved in corporate finance in London and
another 40 in Zurich. David Robins, chief executive of UBS in London, says
Le May has been recruited for his 'transatlantic capability'. Le May, who
will be a vice-chairman of UBS in London, replaces Stephen Brisby, 43, an
ex-Schroders merchant banker, who was appointed head of business development
for UBS in Europe.

Steve Rowley's appointment as general manager of Cellnet, the highly
profitable mobile phone joint venture between British Telecommunications and
Securicor, heralds a further advance by the IBM faction within the higher
reaches of BT.
Rowley joins Cellnet on the coat-tails of Howard Ford, Cellnet's new
managing director. Ford was recruited this June from IBM, where he was
responsible for the group's personal computer business in Europe. Rowley,
35, worked with Ford as head of IBM's personal computer business division.
As managing director of Cellnet, Ford succeeded Stafford Taylor, another
former IBM executive, who is now managing director of personal
communications for BT's main business. The key BT post of corporate
relations director was filled this summer by Ian Ash - yet another IBM
veteran.
All this bears the imprint of Michael Hepher, BT's managing director, who
has been systematically filling senior BT posts with outsiders used to life
at the sharp end of sales and marketing. Hepher was recruited three years
ago from Abbey Life, the insurance group, and has little time for the old
utility mentality still strong at BT.
Unsurprisingly, Rowley's brief includes sales, marketing, products and
customer service.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The truth of the
matter - Advertising is being urged to tone down claims of its effectiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Advertising can be its own worst enemy. It makes exaggerated claims for its
ability to build brands, the result being that finance directors sometimes
argue that any advertising campaign which fails to increase sales must be
worthless. Why go on spending money, they say, on something that doesn't
work?
Andrew Ehrenberg, research professor of marketing at the South Bank
University Business School in London, wants to see claims for advertising's
power toned down. He is leading a two-year research project on how
advertising really works, backed by more than 20 participants from industry
in the UK and the US, where he is visiting professor at the Stern School,
New York University. Companies taking part include General Motors, CBS,
Procter &amp; Gamble, British Telecommunications, Prudential and Shell.
Ehrenberg and his colleague Neil Barnard argue in a paper on the project
that views about advertising fall into three camps:
Advertising as 'natural ingredient in the marketing mix' - virtually a fixed
cost and assumed to be effective. Research and evaluation are often
dismissed by this camp as fairly pointless. This approach might have been
just about tenable in the early days of marketing but, in more accountable
times, is no longer acceptable.
Advertising as an expense which is only justified when it pays for itself
directly, through increased sales. The dominant position today, this view of
advertising as valid only when it is brand building is a reaction to the
earlier, unaccountable approach.
Ehrenberg and Barnard argue that the position is restrictive and leads to
most advertising being classified as ineffective because, in mature markets,
brands cannot continually enjoy increased sales.
Advertising as a way of maintaining sales of a brand. This is the area on
which Ehrenberg and colleagues want to concentrate in their research
project. They argue that brand building may be the effect of advertising in
certain restricted circumstances, but simply keeping customers should be
advertising's more modest aspiration.
The brand maintenance perspective is not new, but the Ehrenberg team claims
it is neglected and underdeveloped. Little is known about how advertising
works for established brands, and they say that advertising planning is
often based on misconceptions about consumer behaviour.
For example, Ehrenberg and Barnard believe that the nature of brand loyalty
among consumers is often misunderstood and considered to be a much stronger
force than is actually the case. 'Your customers are mostly other people's
customers who occasionally buy you' is a well-established principle of
buying behaviour which, they believe, still surprises many advertising and
marketing professionals.
To make their point about the comparative weakness of brand loyalty,
Ehrenberg and Barnard quote a study of the instant coffee market in the US.
This found that the average brand was bought three times a year by its
customers, while those same customers bought instant coffee nine times a
year on average - in other words, the average brand accounted for just one
third of its customers' instant coffee requirements. Loyalty is nothing more
than a propensity to buy a product, they say.
Ehrenberg says that deflating some of the more exaggerated claims for
advertising and greater understanding of consumer purchasing behaviour
should leave advertising more accountable and therefore in a stronger
position to justify its existence.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Mac has the Gaul to
oust Disney
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mickey Mouse has been shunned in favour of something more Gallic in a new,
French-inspired marketing drive for McDonald's restaurants across Europe.
In place of their American confreres at EuroDisney, near Paris, the fast
food chain has looked to Asterix and his friends for its new campaign.
For the next few weeks, children who buy 'happy meals' of hamburger, fries
and coke at McDonald's will be given one of four Asterix characters.
'Sometimes people think of us as a US multinational bulldozing our way in,'
says Michael Boestam, marketing director for the company across Europe.
'McDonald's is an American concept, but we try to be as local as we can.'
He says that most customers are locals, so it is important that the
management in the company's franchises is local. Not only is the choice of
decor left to individual managers, but there are also concessions to local
tastes - such as salmon in Norway and large salad bars in Italy.
Boestam says that Asterix is just one example of an increasingly local focus
within Europe in recent months. 'He is one of the most known symbols in
Europe,' he says.
The promotion - geared to a new film, Asterix and the Great Crossing -
follows an earlier campaign based around a well-known European toy, Lego.
McDonald's has certainly not been shy in the past to use Walt Disney
characters and other US themes in Europe. The Lion King, a Disney film,
provided characters for a previous McDonald's promotion in Europe. So did
two other Disney films: Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast.
And for the future? Boestam says Disney characters are a 'possibility . . .
but not definite'. Asterix wins out in Europe, at least for now.

FT  06 OCT 94 / People: Nurdin &amp; Peacock loses David Poole
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Poole, chief executive of cash and carry operator Nurdin &amp; Peacock for
the past three years, is leaving the company by mutual agreement following a
clash of management styles.
N&amp;P insists Poole's departure after 19 years with the group does not stem
from problems of strategy or its implementation, and he leaves with full
appreciation of his achievements. 'There is no disagreement about the
company's strategy,' N&amp;P says. 'In this case, it is purely a matter of
management style.'
While N&amp;P would not go into details, Poole is known within the retail trade
for being a 'hands-on' manager with a direct forceful style. Richard
Fulford, the chairman, says N&amp;P requires a 'new management style and
increased teamwork to progress the key initiatives which were put in place
earlier this year'.
Those initiatives include converting N&amp;P's outlets to the TBW format,
offering bigger general merchandise and office stationery ranges; the
acquisition of the M6 cash and carry chain from Ireland's Fitzwilton - the
first acquisition in N&amp;P's 184-year history; and the building and opening of
three US-style warehouse clubs, called Cargo Club.
Poole's departure will reduce the executive committee running the company
from four to three. It will now be chaired by Tony Hopkins, trading
director, and also includes Nigel Hall, finance director, and Alex Rentoul,
commercial director.
Fulford will also be increasing his involvement as chairman, and says he is
'confident that this team will take the company forward'.
However, a successor to Poole is thought likely to be appointed in due
course.

FT  06 OCT 94 / People: Strategic move for Sandland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The hunt is on for a new chief investment manager for the Norwich Union
Insurance group, one of Britain's biggest mutual insurers, following last
week's retirement of Mike Sandland (right) after eight years in the post.
Sandland, 56, joined Norwich Union in 1961 and has spent all his life on the
investment side of one of Britain's biggest institutional investors. In
addition to managing Pounds 33bn, Sandland has made a name for himself as
one of a growing band of institutional investors who are taking a more
aggressive stance towards the managements of underperforming companies.
His most famous clash with one such happened three years ago when he was
chairman of the Institutional Shareholders Committee and helped oust the
board of Tace, a small company making pollution monitoring equipment. He is
a member of the Cadbury committee on corporate governance and has been one
of the leading institutional opponents of long rolling contracts for
directors.
After 33 years, Sandland felt it was time to 'get off the executive
treadmill' and has retired three years early. His first retirement job is in
joining Tom Frost, the former chief executive of National Westminster Bank,
on the advisory board of The Strategic Partnership, a small management
consultancy set up earlier this year.
Despite his criticism of some company boards, Sandland is hoping to pick up
a few non-executive directorships. He has plenty of contacts, since his job
at Norwich Union meant that he regularly met the chairman and senior
management of nearly all of the UK's larger companies. (See Observer)

FT  06 OCT 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Knives out for
pirates - A New York company is taking legal action against Bangkok's
copycats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a couple of years it seemed like a good idea: Izabel Lam, a growing New
York jewellery and tableware design company, farmed out production of some
of its cutlery to contractors in Thailand, where metalworking skills were
available more cheaply than in the US.
Now the cost-cutting plan has turned sour. Tim McCarthy, Izabel Lam
president, says Thai factories have been churning out hundreds of thousands
of copies of his company's knives, forks, spoons and serving plates.
McCarthy reckons the pirates have cost Izabel Lam Dollars 6.5m (Pounds 4.3m)
of lost business and Dollars 250,000 in legal fees as it attempts to remedy
the problem with a torrent of litigation: 'Sales of our (genuine) cutlery
have dropped 90 per cent in the last three months.'
Pirated copies of Izabel Lam cutlery have been exported to Japan, the US and
Europe. As many as five Thai companies and 50 distributors in 20 countries
are involved, McCarthy says. 'Thailand has become the copying capital of the
world,' he says. 'Contracts generally are not respected.'
There is no doubt that intellectual piracy is rampant in Thailand. It is
easy to buy pirated computer software, music cassettes and videos on the
streets of Bangkok, although some items become temporarily hard to find when
the US is making its annual assessment of Thailand's enforcement of
copyright rules.
Copies of clothes and luggage by leading French and Italian designers are
also openly on display at street stalls, as are 'Rolex' watches costing a
mere Dollars 10 each.
Most of these products are known to be copies or fakes by the people who buy
them in Bangkok. By contrast, exports from Thailand to the west which may be
in breach of international copyright conventions - or manufactured secretly
by contractors in addition to their licensed production for legitimate brand
names - are much more difficult to identify.
McCarthy values the total turnover of table-top products, including cutlery,
at Dollars 18bn-Dollars 20bn in the industrialised countries, and he says
about Dollars 5bn of this is accounted for by pirated merchandise from
Thailand and elsewhere.
Unlike most other designers, Izabel Lam has taken the unusual step of making
a public fuss about its piracy claims, and it has begun legal action in
Thailand, Germany and France after finding what it regards as copies of its
designs in shops in Europe and Thailand and on display at Thai stands during
recent trade fairs in Frankfurt and Paris.
At the centre of the controversy is a product called Sphere cutlery, a
design characterised by wavy handles culminating in bulbous ends. Izabel
Lam, a Hong Kong Chinese designer who founded her Brooklyn-based company in
1980, was inspired by wavy underwater sea-grass while scuba-diving, McCarthy
says. 'It's unique . . . so there couldn't be a case of somebody mistaking
the design.'
Since May this year, Izabel Lam has served 'cease and desist' notices
against shops and traders in France, Germany and Thailand selling what it
believes are copies of its designs, and some have co-operated with Izabel
Lam's investigations by suspending sales of the products and naming their
suppliers.
The company has also obtained German and French court injunctions against
Thai companies and a Thai government department promoting exports at trade
fairs in Frankfurt and Paris. 'Virtually every major trade fair is being
used by Thai companies to ship out bogus product,' says McCarthy.
Successful action against pirates is rare, but not unknown. Izabel Lam was
encouraged by the expulsion of an Indonesian company from a Frankfurt
textile fair in May after it was accused of copying US and European designs.
At a Frankfurt fair in August, according to McCarthy, no fewer than seven
outlets were offering variants of Izabel Lam designs. He says he was told
repeatedly that he would be killed if he attempted to pursue the matter in
Bangkok - not an unusual threat in the Thai business world.
In Paris in September, Izabel Lam found one of its Thai sub-contractors, NV
Aranyik, a company based in Ayudhya, north of Bangkok, selling a design
similar to Sphere under the auspices of the Thai department of industrial
promotion. The Paris trade fair brochure shows cutlery similar but not
identical to Sphere, with the handle-ends in the form of a loop rather than
a bulb, but NV Aranyik denies copyright violation. 'We are not copying
anything,' says Somchai Wangsilabat, a director.
Izabel Lam is forming a new pressure group to campaign for the rights of
designers. Known as TOP Design (True, Original, Protected), it will be
funded by Dollars 10,000 from each member company.
McCarthy also intends to pursue legal action in Europe and Thailand, but the
impact in Thailand is likely to be limited by the difficulty of proving
design theft for commonplace household items such as cutlery and by the
small fines awarded in Thai courts for breach of copyright.
Thai government officials say that the maximum award made so far has been
Bt200,000 (Pounds 5,065).
Until research, development and design in Thailand grow to the point where
Thai companies have an interest in copyright protection, intellectual piracy
is likely to remain a problem.
Nantabhat Bhukkanasut, an official of the Thai Department of Intellectual
Property, says Thai courts have yet to decide whether cutlery should be
covered by universal copyright protection or by patents for industrial
designs. Izabel Lam, he says, should have registered its design in Thailand
before starting production.
McCarthy replies that bureaucracy makes it impossible for a small company to
register every new design in every country, but Nantabhat insists that
Izabel Lam erred in assuming that its design would be protected by world
copyright. 'It was a false assumption,' he says.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Names spurred on by Gooda judgment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Action groups of Lloyd's Names held up in the legislative queue to claim
damages yesterday seized on Tuesday's Gooda Walker judgment to urge the
professional agencies they are suing to agree out-of-court settlements.
The success of the Gooda Walker action group in the High Court in winning
compensation for negligent underwriting during the late 1980s has led others
to believe their hand has been strengthened.
But the Gooda Walker case has also highlighted the limited pool of errors
and omissions (E&amp;O) insurance cover held by members' agencies being sued.
Claims for negligence would be paid by this cover. Lloyd's Names earlier
this year rejected the insurance market's settlement worth Pounds 900m.
Lawyers for E&amp;O insurers yesterday refused to discuss publicly the
possibility of settlements. But Mr Alan Porter, chairman of the Devonshire
Names Action Group, which is claiming Pounds 174m on behalf of 1,140
members, said the Gooda Walker verdict provided a basis for a possible
settlement for other 'spiral' cases, where underwriters agreed to cover
others against excessive losses from catastrophes. The next 'spiral' case,
mounted by Names on the Feltrim syndicates, starts later this month.
Mr Josceline Grove, secretary of the Secretan Names Association, urged
Lloyd's, which so far has said only that it would facilitate a deal, to take
a stronger lead in forging a settlement.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Adams says meetings with US officials going well
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, said that his meetings with US
officials in Washington this week had brought 'an enormous move forward for
peace and for justice and reconciliation in Ireland', George Graham and
David Owen write.
He added: 'We have made the hope more of a reality today.'
Mr Adams's comments came after he had met senior officials at the US State
Department on Tuesday in the first official contact between the US
administration and Sinn Fein, and after a lengthy debate with Mr Ken
Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist MP, on the CNN cable television network.
But the debate, touted as the highlight of Mr Adams's two-week tour of the
US, was rated as a 'no-score draw' by observers. The two men tried to outdo
each other with stories of how many times they had been shot at or bombed.
Mr Adams (pictured right) sought repeatedly to put Mr Maginnis (left) on the
spot by offering a handshake. Mr Maginnis refused and spoke only to the
show's host, Larry King, rather than to Mr Adams.
But both men came under attack from viewers - all of them claiming to be
Irish - for refusing to do what was necessary to bring about peace.
Mr Maginnis's decision to participate in a debate with Mr Adams was attacked
by Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist
party. He said the arguments in favour of taking part were 'heavily
outweighed by the principles that have been given away by him sitting down
on the same platform as the leader of the Provisional movement'.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Broadcasters may develop digital decoder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC, Channel 4 and the ITV companies have started discussions on the
possibility of developing their own encryption system to decode digital
television transmissions.
The talks, disclosed in Electronics Times, the trade magazine, are still at
a preliminary stage. Mr Ken Sheppard, chief engineer of LWT, one of the
biggest ITV companies, said: 'It's still very early days,' but confirmed
that the broadcasters were considering developing their own system.
Digital television, which should be able to offer a wider range of services
to viewers than the existing analogue format, could start as early as the
end of next year.
Satellite channels are expected to be the first to go digital, followed by
the terrestrial channels from late 1997. The BBC, Channel 4 and the ITV
companies are planning how to market and deliver their digital services.
One option would be for them to buy the encryption system developed by
British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television network in which Pearson,
owner of the Financial Times, has a stake.
BSkyB hopes to take the lead in digital satellite television and has
invested heavily to create sophisticated descrambling and subscription
management facilities.
The terrestrial broadcasters have, however, expressed fears about the risk
of BSkyB exploiting its dominant market position.
These concerns were heightened in the row over the code of conduct unveiled
last week by the European Digital Video Broadcasting project, which in
theory will allow one company to dominate access to digital television.
As a result the UK broadcasters are exploring other options, including the
possibility of joining forces with a set-top box manufacturer.
At the European Digital Video Broadcasting project meeting in Geneva last
week 12 broadcasters voted against the new code of conduct and 17 voted in
favour.

FT  06 OCT 94 / MoD abandons plan for housing trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence has abandoned plans to privatise Pounds 3.5bn worth
of housing stock by setting up a non-profit trust. It has appointed NatWest
Markets, the investment banking arm of the clearing bank, to advise on new
options.
The ministry blamed 'technical difficulties' for the shift and yielded to
the Treasury view that a trust would not provide a suitable vehicle for a
private-sector solution. It said: 'The question was whether a trust could be
classified as a private-sector entity.'
The MoD said NatWest Markets would advise on fresh options to improve the
management of its property and transfer the whole of the married quarters'
estate - 68,000 homes - to the private sector.
NatWest Markets has a purely advisory role which will last only a few weeks,
but it will be well-placed to act on behalf of the MoD in an eventual
transaction.
The ministry is seeking a sale-and-leaseback transaction which would provide
funds to offset cuts in the 1995-96 defence budget while giving it the use
of the majority of the properties.
NatWest is expected to look at a range of strategies, from transferring the
homes to a company which would be sold in an initial public offering to
partial privatisation. It might recommend no action.
The size of the transaction will depend on the terms of the leaseback or
rentback arrangement but an MoD housing sale could be one of the last big UK
privatisations.
According to the MoD and the official valuer the gross value of the housing
stock is Pounds 3.5bn. The MoD has budgeted for Pounds 500m of revenue from
housing privatisation in 1995-96 and investment bankers say that the
proceeds could go as high as Pounds 2bn.
The MoD has set a demanding timetable since deciding to review its
initiative on housing. It invited financial advisers to pitch for the
mandate in September and NatWest Markets is due to make its recommendations
before the end of this month.
Three banks, NatWest Markets, US investment bank Morgan Stanley and UK
merchant bank Lazard Brothers, are believed to have made it to the shortlist
and a 'bake-off' - a final pitch - last week.
Morgan Stanley, one of the most active US investment banks, came runner-up.
NatWest Markets capitalised on its combination of experience in UK
privatisations and of raising finance for housing associations. It acted as
a global manager for the third British Telecom share offering and earlier
advised the government on the privatisation of BAA, the British airports
authority.
The bank is the biggest raiser of debt finance for housing associations,
with a total of more than Pounds 2bn.

A total of 312,000 people have been caught in the past year making false
claims on a range of welfare benefits, the Benefits Agency said in its
annual report yesterday. Catching the benefit cheats had saved the social
security system Pounds 654m.
The main areas of fraud were: misrepresenting income (60 per cent of cases);
failure to include family circumstances (25 per cent); counterfeit or stolen
benefit books (10 per cent); and giving false identities (5 per cent).

code of practice on national newspaper distribution, published yesterday,
could accelerate the expansion of multiple retailers at the expense of
smaller independents.
Mr David Daniel, director of federation services, said the code, which
requires new newsagents to pay a deposit to secure wholesale supplies,
risked intensifying competition for existing independents and deterring new
ones. It was previously left to wholesalers to decide whether to supply new
newsagents.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Housing starts continue to rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Housing starts were 54,300 in the three months to the end of August, up 15
per cent over the same period last year, government figures released
yesterday show, Simon London writes.
The annual rate of increase was slightly higher than during the previous
three months, suggesting that housebuilders were anticipating an improvement
in housing market conditions.
However, the greatest increase came from housing associations, which started
building 12,300 dwellings in the period, up from 9,100 last year.
Private-sector housebuilders started 41,600 homes, against 37,500 last year.
Analysts pointed out that the figures cover the period immediately before
last month's half percentage point increase in base rates. Tarmac, the UK's
second largest housebuilder, said last week that house sales had halved
since the rate rise.

FT  06 OCT 94 / BSkyB plans 1,000 jobs in Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television company, is to locate its
second subscriber management centre in Scotland, creating the equivalent of
up to 1,000 full-time jobs by 2000.
The Pounds 10m centre will be at Dunfermline, Fife, across the Forth estuary
from the company's centre at Livingston, West Lothian.
The two centres will handle the accounts of subscribers to BSkyB services.
The Livingston centre, opened in 1990 with 150 staff, now has a permanent
staff of 1,300 and engages another 500 at peak times.
The choice of Scotland for the new BSkyB development is seen as a particular
success for Locate in Scotland, the inward investment agency. The company
had narrowed the choice to Dunfermline and Dublin, the Irish capital.
BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake, will
build a 100,000 sq ft centre in two stages on an 8 1/2 -acre site at
Dunfermline. The first stage will be ready for occupation next autumn.
The new investment will help offset the effect on the Fife economy of the
downgrading of the Rosyth naval base to a naval support establishment. A
total of 700 civilian workers at the base are to lose their jobs in the next
few years and the number of naval personnel stationed there is to be cut
from 1,800 to 300.
BSkyB expects to provide a substantial number of part-time jobs at
Dunfermline, eventually reaching the equivalent of 1,000 full-time posts. It
expects 60 per cent of the workforce to be women.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said the project reinforced Scotland's
position as 'one of the premier locations in Europe for call-centre
projects'. He said Scotland was now the home of a number of telemarketing
and back-office processing operations.
Shinetsu Handotai, the Japanese maker of silicon wafers, is to invest a
further Pounds 23m at its plant at Livingston.
It plans to increase capacity from 130,000 wafers a month to 200,000 by
January and to 330,000 by April 1996, bringing the company's investment in
the Livingston plant to Pounds 53m, and raising employment from 250 to 350
people. The wafers are used to manufacture semiconductors.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Tyne councils in job-creation plea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of three Tyneside councils yesterday urged the government to support
a six-point plan, Regenerating Tyneside, to tackle the recent wave of job
cuts in an area already suffering persistent high unemployment.
The leaders of Labour-controlled Newcastle, North and South Tyneside
councils say in a letter to Mr John Major, the prime minister, that without
a significant package of job-creation measures, particularly in high
technology and modern manufacturing, the Tyneside economy may never recover
from the 'deluge' of recent job cuts and closures.
During a visit to the area this morning, Mr Ian Taylor, Tyne and Wear
sponsor minister, will announce measures to assist Tyneside's regeneration.
These may include an enterprise zone. This is subject to European Commission
approval and was first suggested by the government last year when Swan
Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, went into receivership. However, the
government's aid package may fall short of the scale the local authorities
want.
The councils' plan includes government support for:
Retention of shipbuilding on the Tyne.
Development of marine engineering companies including oil and gas
technology.
Early construction of a new Tyne crossing.
More high-quality vocational training initiatives.
Large-scale reclamation and development projects.
Mr John Foster, executive director of North Tyneside Council, said: 'We are
talking about a package in the tens of millions of pounds.'
In the past 18 months Tyneside has lost its last colliery, while its last
shipbuilder, Swan Hunter, has shed 2,000 jobs and faces closure. The
offshore fabrication sector has cut about 1,000 jobs.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Legal challenge to Tube strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The RMT transport union faces a legal challenge to stop the 24-hour Tube
strike which is due to start at 7.30 this evening.
London Underground is questioning the validity of the union's ballot which
resulted in support for industrial action. It said last night: 'We are
considering seeking a High Court injunction to prevent the disruption. There
were irregularities in the ballot.'
The RMT is demanding a basic pay rise of at least 4 per cent although the
rest of the staff employed by London Underground have agreed to a pay
settlement this year of 2.5 per cent.
A total of 15 hours of talks at the conciliation service Acas earlier this
week failed to produce a deal. London Underground said it was willing to
hold further discussions but emphasised it would not improve its 2.5 per
cent offer.
The company says that a number of its employees who are RMT members failed
to receive voting papers for the ballot, although they were entitled to
participate.
The union denied this yesterday, pointing out that London Underground had
given no indication of how many employees were covered by the complaint. It
said that its solicitors were considering the position.
Only 37 per cent of the 7,500 RMT members at London Underground took part in
the ballot last month. Of those, 2,072 backed strike action and 809 opposed
it. The ballot was carried out by an independent organisation - Electoral
Reform Balloting Services.
A 24-hour strike planned for last Friday was called off when it became clear
that notification of the strike had not specified the exact period of the
action. The union's lawyers advised the executive to make the period covered
by the stoppage more precise.
Mr Bob Crow, a leading leftwing member of the RMT executive, has been
elected one of the union's three assistant general secretaries. He ousted Mr
Tony McGregor by 2-1 in a ballot of members.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Firms wary over share-deal curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London-based securities firms reacted with caution yesterday to plans by the
Stock Exchange to suspend trading in individual stocks if there is evidence
that price-sensitive information has leaked.
Few would welcome an increase in the number of share suspensions in the
London market, where such moves are significantly less common than on Wall
Street.
Although they do not expect the plan to promote much change in current
trading practice, City stockbrokers agree privately that existing market
regulation could benefit from more frequent use of the exchange's power to
suspend trading in shares seen to be behaving abnormally.
The exchange monitors share price movements widely on a regular basis, but
share suspension has in the past been used sparingly in London.
Objectors to a more aggressive share suspension policy point out that
suspension penalises all holders of the stock, as well as potential
investors or, as one dealer said, 'a host of people who had nothing to do
with the original offence'. He added that suspension 'should only be used as
a last resort'.
More frequent share suspensions could also sit awkwardly with London's
marketmaking system, which depends on the willingness of marketmaking firms
to take on very big positions in individual stocks.
A dealer said: 'Unexpected suspension of a share could leave the marketmaker
in a very difficult situation, unable to unwind his position through the
market.'
The exchange plan seeks to meet these objections by introducing a
pre-suspension process, taking the share through stages of 'market alert'
and 'trading halt' before imposing full suspension.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Bacteria 'present in up to 60% of chickens'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only two in five raw chickens are free of bacteria which cause food
poisoning, according to a survey published today by the Consumers'
Association.
Salmonella was found in 36 per cent of 160 raw chicken samples tested in the
UK, while 41 per cent contained the bacteria campylobacter, the association
said in a report in Which? magazine. Campylobacter can cause diarrhoea,
vomiting, pain and fever, and in rare cases can result in death.
Britain had one of the worst scores for poultry cleanliness in a survey of
14 European countries by consumer organisations, the association said. Only
Denmark and Portugal scored worse for salmonella, while the UK was
fifth-worst for campylobacter.
Norway had the cleanest chicken, with none of its samples carrying
salmonella and only 1 per cent infected with campylobacter.
The association said this showed that better results could be achieved and
called on the British government to clean up chicken production. Problems
included contaminated feed, poor hygiene and cramped housing, it said.
Ms Charlotte Gann, senior editor of Which? magazine, said: 'There is
absolutely no way a shopper can tell if chicken is contaminated, so all
chicken must be treated as suspect. This clearly isn't good enough.'
The association said some magazines were still publishing recipes using raw
eggs with no warning of the dangers of salmonella. It said that one or two
eggs in every 1,000 were likely to be contaminated.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Taskforces to boost engineers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five new taskforces aimed at making industry more competitive by increasing
the influence and involvement of engineers were announced yesterday by Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
The programme, Action for Engineering, is a direct result of the Department
of Trade and Industry's white paper on competitiveness, published in May,
which identified a number of ways in which UK industrial performance could
be improved through the better use of engineers.
It represents the first co-ordinated attempt to address the underlying
problems for the economy caused by the relatively low status of engineers,
by bringing together industrialists, educationists and the engineering
professions in industry-led taskforces.
Mr Rob Margetts, a director of ICI, has been appointed chairman of the
programme's steering group, which was due to hold its first meeting last
night.
The five main areas where action is sought are:
Stimulating enthusiasm in schools for engineering.
Harnessing engineers' full potential in industry. Training more technicians,
supervisors and skilled workers, and improving the quality of training.
Attracting the best staff and students into engineering higher education.
Enhancing the understanding and status of engineering at board level in
companies, among financial institutions and opinion formers.
Mr Margetts said 'an enormous amount' had been done in an attempt to rectify
the weaknesses caused by the way engineers' skills were being used, but the
situation had not improved a great deal. The taskforces would aim to bring
greater focus and co-ordination to the many initiatives already under way,
such as the work being done by the Engineering Council and others to
encourage more schoolchildren to study engineering.
The taskforces would be complementary to such initiatives and the
long-running attempt by Sir John Fairclough, chairman of the Engineering
Council, to create a more unified professional structure for engineering.
Dr David Evans, head of the DTI's technology and innovation division, said
the department was participating in an enabling and supporting role. He
said: 'The ownership of this work has got to be within the engineering
community. The government is not divorced from the programme, and has to
have a partnership role.'
No budget has been allocated for the programme, which is expected to last 18
months, but Mr Margetts said he would be surprised if it did not produce
some case for additional improvements in funding.
He stressed that he would ensure the taskforces did not turn into
talking-shops by appointing busy, 'action-oriented' people.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Insurance agents set for change on their doorstep: The
uncertain future of 'the man from the Pru'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For about 10m households the appearance each month of the insurance agent to
collect premiums and perhaps have a chat about their financial needs is a
regular and familiar part of life.
For the life insurance sector, this business is a rare area of stability in
an industry which otherwise faces big changes.
New policies in the industrial branch business - as this type of life
insurance is known - have been declining slowly in recent years, from 2.05m
in 1990 to 1.21m last year, but the number of policies in force is still
47m. It will take a long time for this type of business to wither, and in
the meantime it represents a loyal and long-term customer base.
But even this area is set to be affected by the regulatory and other shifts
in the life industry. First, the government is planning consultation on
deregulating the arrangements for industrial branch business.
Second, and particularly important, is the requirement that from the start
of next year, across the life insurance sector, customers be given fuller
information about costs and charges.
This area of the market is not particularly price sensitive, but there is a
general recognition that disclosing charges will affect sales.
The relatively few companies which deal in home service and cash collection
business are responding to these impending changes in sharply different
ways.
Pearl yesterday launched a television advertising campaign intended to
emphasise that its home service provides a more personal relationship than
customers are likely to find at a bank or building society branch.
Its line is that this personal element is seen as especially important as
many services become more automated.
By contrast, Prudential Corporation, the UK's biggest life insurer - which
in some ways epitomises the sector through 'the man from the Pru'  - has
already taken steps to reduce the amount of industrial branch business it
writes, though maintaining its home service sales force.
These home service sales agents will still call at customers' homes, but
payments are likely to be made through bank accounts, and visits would
normally be less frequent.
Industrial branch business itself is subject to separate legislative rules,
which include regular and frequent cash or cheque collections of premiums -
usually once a month. The range of policies which can be sold is limited,
and premiums are often relatively small - smaller than life companies might
accept for ordinary life policies.
The combination of low premiums and high collection costs can have a marked
effect on the return customers are likely to see for their investments.
London &amp; Manchester, the life insurance and financial services group,
estimates that for a Pounds 5-a-week premium 10-year policy, on a 10 per
cent return, an IB policy will yield Pounds 3,150, while an ordinary policy
will yield Pounds 3,840.
Prudential says comparing typical IB and ordinary business rates of expenses
 -at 40 per cent and 20 per cent respectively - a 10-year endowment at 10
per cent rate of return for a Pounds 20-a-month premium will give Pounds
2,400 for an IB policy, compared with Pounds 3,200 for ordinary business.
Against the background of this effect on the value of the full-term policy
to the customer, it is no wonder that companies emphasise the other aspects
of what they do.
They point out that if they did not provide a service then their customers
might not have an opportunity to make provision for themselves at all. Mr
George Mack, financial director of United Friendly, said: 'A lot of our
clients would find it difficult to manage their bank accounts.'
They also emphasise the service element in their relationship. Mr Tom Pyne,
chief executive of London &amp; Manchester, said: 'There's a lot more to the
business than investment returns. A lot of elderly people value the weekly
call of the collector.'
Prudential takes a rather bleaker line. Mr Jim Sutcliffe, managing director
of Prudential's home service, said: 'If you are going to be committed to
providing products that are good value for money, you can't sell industrial
branch business.'
He estimates that four out of five IB customers have bank accounts, and so
could benefit from the lower costs that would arise from paying premiums
through direct debit or standing order. 'The right advice to most of those
people is to open a bank account,' he says. said.
It will take the new disclosure regime next year to see whether the IB
customers themselves agree with that advice.

FT  06 OCT 94 / InterCity aims to woo lost travellers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
InterCity is to offer 25,000 free tickets to rail travellers on November 8
and 9 in a competition aimed at winning back customers lost during the
16-week signal workers' strike.
Seats will be offered on the six long-distance InterCity routes covering 140
destinations from Penzance to Inverness and about 2,000 miles of railway
travel.
The InterCity companies - Great Western, East Coast, Cross Country, Midland
Main Line, West Coast and Anglia - lost Pounds 53m in revenues, a quarter of
the total loss suffered by the entire rail network.
Other parts of the British Rail network are also considering special
promotions involving free or discounted tickets to attract people back to
the railway. South West Trains said it was looking at a similar promotion
while South Eastern said it was planning a campaign to boost travel.
Mr Andrew Harvey, InterCity marketing manager, said the Pounds 1m promotion
was 'a way to encourage customers who were forced into seeking other means
of transport to come back to the railway, and our way of saying thank you to
customers for putting up with the disruption throughout the dispute'.
Up to 250,000 people are expected to take part in the competition, which
will be advertised in the press. They will be asked to answer a question and
fill in a coupon giving their choice of destination and day and time of
travel.
InterCity denied that seats would be offered only on trains which nobody
wanted to travel on and said all InterCity services would be on offer,
including every Pullman service. There will, however, be quotas on the most
popular trains.
The free seats are being offered on a Tuesday and Wednesday because
InterCity offers its fullest service in the week. This may exclude many
commuters because they will be at work.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Rival group may challenge milk levy plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rival milk group threatened yesterday to launch a legal challenge to the
Milk Marketing Board if it went ahead with plans to charge Britain's 28,000
dairy farmers up to 4p per litre to provide the funding for market
liberalisation in November.
Mr Richard Smith, chairman of the Northern Milk Partnership, which
represents a group of farmers who have agreed to sell their milk to Northern
Foods in the new free market, said he was examining ways in which any
attempt to deduct money from his members could be resisted through the UK
and European courts.
Mr Smith, who has written in protest to Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture
minister, called by the Milk Marketing Board suggestion of the levy
'astonishing and, if implemented, nothing short of disgraceful'.
The milk board needs about Pounds 30m to wind up its operations and
establish Milk Marque, the voluntary farmers' co-operative that will succeed
it.
It said yesterday that the probability of the levy being imposed was minute,
but that it had to have funds to hand should guarantees from its banks not
come through in time for market deregulation on November 1.
But all farmers would be expected to pay the levy, even if they had no plans
to join Milk Marque. Mr Smith said it was 'iniquitous' that the 30 per cent
of producers who had made alternative arrangements for selling their milk
should be forced to pay. He said it would cost his members about Pounds
2,000 each.
The National Farmers' Union said it was extremely concerned about the
possibility that the money would not be repaid. Sir David Naish, union
president, is to meet Mr Bob Steven, chairman of the board, on Monday to
discuss the issue.
The board needs to raise cash to finance the market's deregulation because
the flotation of its processing arm, Dairy Crest, has been delayed.
Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive of the board, said farmers who had not
signed up with Milk Marque should still be prepared to pay the levy as it
would guarantee the free market going ahead from November 1 which was in
everyone's interests.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Howard seeks to reassure police
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, yesterday sought to reassure senior
police officers over proposals they fear may lead to greater private-sector
involvement in policing.
He told the Police Superintendents' Association conference in Leicestershire
it was 'simply not true' that a Home Office review of police tasks was
considering encouraging companies or local authorities to patrol the streets
and deal with traffic.
The review aimed to ensure the money devoted to policing achieved the best
results. 'It is about getting highly trained officers out of time-wasting
duties and into productive ones where their training will be used to full
effect,' he said. It was not about looking for ways to cut the number of
police constables.
But the Police Federation of England and Wales said yesterday that the
privatisation of prisoner escort services had not released one extra police
officer to fight street crime.
Mr Fred Broughton, the federation chairman, told a Labour conference fringe
meeting in Blackpool that police numbers had instead been cut in line with
the number of officers relieved of the task.
He said: 'There is a bit of a myth about transferring police duties to
civilians because it does not lead to those thousands of extra police
officers on the streets that the government suggests it does.'
A speech to the Leicester conference by Chief Superintendent David Golding,
association president, was thought by some observers to have been watered
down. A hard-hitting draft had been available to journalists earlier this
week but Mr Golding omitted some passages when he delivered the speech.
Later Mr Howard denied that he or his department put any pressure on Mr
Golding to amend the speech. Mr Golding said he had changed his script after
it became clear that some of his fears and concerns were being addressed.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Industrial tribunal results 'improve'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The industrial tribunal system appears to have substantially improved its
productivity, in spite of government concern that it is becoming overloaded.
An analysis in the latest Employment Gazette shows that 30 per cent more
cases were cleared in 1993-94 than in the previousa year. More than 110,000
cases were heard by a tribunal, handled by the conciliation service Acas or
withdrawn, compared with about 85,000 in 1992-93.
The tribunals disposed of 69,612 cases compared with 53,445 in the previous
year. That included a substantial increase in unfair dismissal cases from
33,683 to 42,757.
The government is still expected to press ahead with a consultative paper on
reform of the industrial tribunal system. The paper, expected next month or
early next year, is likely to concentrate on making the system more
efficient and on holding back its rising costs.
Some employers' organisations are critical of the narrow focus government
consultation is likely to take. Mr Peter Martin, a legal expert at the
Engineering Employers Federation, said: 'We are concerned that the whole
thing will be too narrow and will not look at issues like simplifying the
law.'
The Employment Gazette study and a separate analysis of unfair dismissal
cases showed:
About two-thirds of cases dealt with by industrial tribunals in 1993-94 did
not reach a tribunal hearing because they were resolved through Acas
conciliation or settled privately.
The distribution, hotels, catering and repairs sector remained the biggest
source of unfair dismissal cases, although its share in the total was
falling.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Shorts to shed 350 missiles jobs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Short Brothers, the Belfast-based aerospace company, is axing 350 jobs at
its missile division. It said it had failed to land expected orders for its
plant at Castlereagh, Belfast, but hoped that some workers might be
redeployed.
Shorts, a subsidiary of Bombardier of Canada, last year agreed to join
forces with Thomson-CSF, the French state-controlled defence electronics
group, to make short-range ground-to-air missiles.
Shorts' missile division employs 800 people. Unions said the 350 job losses
'raised serious questions' about the future of the Castlereagh-based missile
division.
Mr Joe Bowers of the Manufacturing, Science and Finance union said the
losses continued the 'rolling programme of redundancies' by Shorts in recent
years. Staff at the division were planning a walk-out in protest, he added.
Unions said that the decision undermined the ability of Shorts to continue
as an independent missile systems designer and developer.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Persil Power 'no better than others': Unilever rejects
report in new round of soap wars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Persil Power, Unilever's controversial detergent, is no better overall at
removing stains from clothes than other soap powders such as Novon Colour,
Sainsbury's own-label brand, and Procter &amp; Gamble's Ariel Ultra, the
Consumers' Association said yesterday.
Ms Helen Parker, acting editor of Which?, the association's magazine, said
that although the powder was good at removing some stains such as red wine,
like other detergents, it was much less effective against difficult stains
such as curry. Which? magazine carries a report on Persil Power in its
latest issue.
Unilever rejected the report. It said: 'The Consumers' Association is not a
test institute. It is trying to work in a very complex situation. Tests by
independent research laboratories show Persil Power is superior.'
The detergent, which Unilever has promoted as the biggest breakthrough in a
generation in cleaning power, has sparked controversy because of allegations
that its patented manganese catalyst, the 'accelerator', can damage clothes
under certain conditions.
Soon after the launch of Persil Power the volume of 'accelerator' in the
detergent was reduced by Unilever.
The Consumers' Association tested the original version in June and the
latest version last month and found no difference between them in cleaning
power.
Ms Parker said: 'If you were worried that you were missing out on a
revolution in stain-busting because of the controversy over Persil Power,
then rest easy. Our independent tests show that the stain-removing ability
of new Persil Power is no better than that of some of its rival brands and
own-brands.'
The association said that its tests for potential damage by Persil Power to
clothes will not be completed for several months.
The Dutch consumers' association concluded three weeks ago that Omo Power,
the version of the detergent sold on the Continent, was no better at stain
removal than other detergents. Moreover, the damage it caused clothes was
'more than comparable powders'.
Unilever gained support yesterday, however, from the Danish consumers'
association, which was quoted as saying: 'There is no acute problem and we
do not advise against Omo Power. If the detergent damages the garments, it
will be a long-term effect.'
The association also said it did not know whether other detergents had the
same long-term effects because 'no other detergent has been tested as
thoroughly as Omo Power'.
Each negative report has hit Unilever's sales of the detergent, particularly
in the Netherlands and Britain where press coverage has been heaviest.
Unilever stood by its claims for the cleaning prowess of the latest Persil
Power. It said: 'The Consumers' Association's results are based on
laboratory testing. What we have always said is that it is what happens in
homes that counts.'

FT  06 OCT 94 / Jump seen in double income families
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly one-third of British households contain dual-earner couples and only
17 per cent contain sole-earner couples, according to research on household
income published in the latest Employment Gazette.
There has also been a surge in the employment rate of women with children -
57 per cent were working in 1989 compared with 46 per cent in 1981.
Employment during that period increased faster among certain groups of
mothers, including those with fewer and younger children, white mothers,
mothers living with employed partners and mothers with higher levels of
qualification.
Employment grew slowly or even fell among mothers with three or more
children, mothers with no qualifications, mothers with non-employed partners
and lone mothers - whose employment rate fell from 45 per cent to 41 per
cent.
Employment Gazette says: 'Employment trends are creating a process of
differentiation and polarisation among families with children. For example,
the number of no-earner and dual-earner families increased in the 1980s.
'Furthermore, among dual-earner families there is a small but growing group
where both parents are employed full-time.'
A separate analysis of household employment in 1991 stresses the growing
inequality in household income.
It says: 'At one end of the spectrum there are households where both
partners are working and some adult children are also working.
'At the other end of the spectrum there are households where both partners
are unemployed . . . and where adult children are also unemployed.
'Elderly people also tend to be in the households with the least resources
and which have few, if any, earners.'

FT  06 OCT 94 / Nadir aide charged over Polly money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Elizabeth Forsyth, a close associate of Mr Asil Nadir, was yesterday
charged with two offences of handling money stolen from Polly Peck
Inter-national, the fruit-to-electronics empire formerly chaired by the
fugitive businessman.
Mrs Forsyth chaired South Audley Management, the company that dealt with Mr
Nadir's personal tax and property affairs.
She was charged at Holborn police station yesterday morning and later
appeared at Bow Street magistrates court to be remanded on bail until
November 16.
The two charges allege that between October 16 and 22 1989 Mrs Forsyth
handled Pounds 458,050 belonging to Polly Peck.
Mrs Forsyth was granted bail on sureties of Pounds 20,000. She was also
ordered to surrender her passport, undertake not to apply for a new one, and
to remain in Britain.
Mrs Forsyth returned voluntarily from northern Cyprus last month to be
questioned by Serious Fraud Office investigators.
Mr Nadir remains in northern Cyprus, where he fled in May last year before
he was due to stand trial on 13 charges of fraud and false accounting
charges involving Pounds 34m.

FT  06 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Taking the modernist medicine
 -Political Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So there we have it. Mr Tony Blair's social-ism is a creed tailored to
Britain's aspirant classes. The Labour party is being made safe for the
sitting rooms of respectable Britain.
The decision to bury the legacy of Sidney and Beatrice Webb was a momentous
one in terms of his own authority. The youngest leader in the party's
history is in command. Even his enemies in Blackpool admit that. But the
real significance lies not in this week's headlines, wonderful though they
were.
Mr Blair's judgment was that Labour had one more chance to make the
electoral breakthrough that has eluded it since Mr Neil Kinnock hauled it
back from the cliff-edge of extremism in 1983. Since then the most damaging
and recurrent refrain on the doorstep has been a simple one: 'You say you've
changed but I'm not sure I believe it.' A new statement of aims and values
to replace the statism of Clause 4 will allow Mr Blair to chip away at that
deadly doubt.
There is a wider significance. The Labour leader plans to present the voters
with a social democratic manifesto. His party has now begun to understand
that. There will be grumbles. Some will fight him. But the majority - even
the dinosaurs at the TGWU and GMB general unions - have nowhere else to go.
The inevitable comparison between Blackpool and the Bad Godesberg conference
of West Germany's social democrats in 1959 is in some ways a superficial
one. Then the SPD burned its Marxist baggage in a single act of expurgation.
Labour has spent a decade dumping the policies which once gave substance to
the dream of Clause 4. But Mr Blair's decision may well have the same
powerful symbolism as Bad Godesberg. Blackpool 1994 already has a place in
the history books.
There will be much argument about the precise terms of the new statement
that Mr Blair will present in draft to the national executive committee. Mr
John Prescott, his traditionalist deputy, will be joined by other
influential figures on the party's soft left in insisting that it must
acknowledge a pivotal role for the state in realising its new ambitions.
The obstacles are surmountable. Mr Blair has already made the elision
between acceptance of a dynamic market economy and a role for government in
creating the conditions for economic success and social stability. There is
nothing unique in his prescription. Not many years ago it could be found
buried between the lines in the speeches of one-nation Tories such as Mr
Chris Patten.
The wordsmiths around the Labour leader should not have too much trouble in
crafting a statement incorporating Mr Blair's touchstones of opportunity,
responsibility, fairness and trust while genuflecting in the direction of
the soft left. It is a fair bet that the statement will land on every
doorstep in the weeks preceding the general election.
The manner of this week's announcement was also important. Mr Blair decided
at the outset of his leadership that he would have to take a bold
initiative. A new statement of values to give credence to the idea of 'new
Labour' was an obvious choice. But it was a brave rather than a rash move.
In every job he has done during his meteoric rise Mr Blair has been as
calculating as he has been bold. He has covered his back and reinforced his
flanks before advancing.
He did so again this week. Mr Prescott initially was unenthusiastic. He had
been instrumental in saving John Smith's leadership during last year's
conference struggle over party democracy. He did not see the case for
another constitutional battle with his friends on the left. The party had
chosen him as deputy to sit in the guard's van behind Mr Blair and apply the
traditionalist brake.
But Mr Prescott acknowledged the case for a bold move; and once he
understood that Mr Blair was determined to press ahead, he determined that
he had to back him. The deputy leader will campaign for the change. Key
figures on the soft left, such as Mr David Blunkett and Mr Robin Cook are
expected to acquiesce. Others will be smart enough to realise that opposing
Mr Blair now would not be the smartest career move.
Several important union figures were carefully squared in the last few hours
before Mr Blair's speech. Mr Prescott helped with the final wording to
ensure that opponents had the narrowest possible angle of fire. Mr Bill
Morris, a prisoner of his executive on the TGWU, will today ceremoniously
cast its block vote in favour of Clause 4. It will be ignored.
Mr Blair would be mistaken though to rest on his laurels. There are policies
to be crafted on the principles he expounded this week. He needs to enthuse
the electorate as well as to reassure it. There will be serious internal
battles over the minimum wage and over full employment. The culture of
struggle and betrayal live on in the Labour party.
There have been serious undercurrents of disagreement this week over tax. Mr
Prescott and his allies are not ready to accept a strategy which could lock
Labour into supporting any tax cuts the government cares to announce before
the general election. Tax will be a bloody internal battleground.
But the party has understood this week that even if it does not like the
taste of Mr Blair's modernist medicine it has no choice but to take it.

FT  06 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Post sell-off 'without any
public support'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday delayed a decision on privatising the Post Office
as Labour warned that it would put the fight to keep the corporation public
at the forefront of its attack on the Tories.
The conference unanimously voted for a motion opposing privatisation and
calling for the Post Office to remain in the public sector with more
commercial freedom. Downing Street said today's cabinet meeting was unlikely
to make a decision on whether to press ahead with flotation of the Royal
Mail. This followed contacts between Mr John Major and Mr Richard Ryder,
chief whip, on the implications of Post Office privatisation.
Although the consultative period over the Post Office's future ended last
week, government officials said the Department of Trade and Industry needed
more time to work through all the responses.
They suggested that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, may
make no announcement on the Post Office's future at next week's Conservative
party conference in Bournemouth.
Mr Heseltine, strongly backed by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, would
like to make a quick decision in favour of selling off 51 per cent of Royal
Mail. Any delay is likely to undermine their efforts to press ahead with the
privatisation.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry spokesman, yesterday told his
party's conference in Blackpool that the people who used the Post Office
wanted it to remain public instead of being turned into someone else's
business.
He said: 'If the government cannot persuade the people who use the Post
Office to privatise it, ministers have no right to ask the House of Commons
to pass a bill to privatise it.'
Mr Cook recalled that Baroness Thatcher, former prime minister, had drawn
back from privatising the Post Office because of public feeling. 'I warn
Michael Heseltine, John Major and the cabinet: People still feel very
strongly about keeping the Post Office in the public sector.'
He said Labour would put the fight to keep the corporation public in the
forefront of its attack on the government when the Commons resumes next
month.
Mr Derek Hodgson, deputy general secretary of the UCW postal workers' union,
attacked Post Office management for promoting privatisation. 'They are a
disgrace,' he said. 'The Post Office does not need to be exposed to the
ravages of money-grabbing speculators.'
After the debate the Post Office said: 'It is misleading scaremongering to
talk about post office closures and loss of services. Whatever happens, the
post office network will stay in the public sector, with a firm commitment
that it remains a nationwide service.'

FT  06 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Leadership faces defeat on
defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair is today expected to face his first defeat at the Labour
conference - on a renewed demand for the scrapping of the Trident missile
system.
Advocates of nuclear disarmament disregarded an appeal by Mr Neil Kinnock,
in his final speech as a member of the party's national executive committee,
to reject the resolution. They demanded a card vote.
The resolution, which also calls for Britain's defence spending to be cut to
the level of other countries in western Europe, is likely to be approved.
Ironically, Mr Kinnock's emotional speech was accorded a standing ovation.
In it he expressed his gratitude for having been given a 'mandate' when he
was Labour leader to change the party's unilateralist policy on nuclear
disarmament.
Delegates laughed and cheered when Mr Kinnock told them: 'Our relationship
has not, on all occasions, been marked by peace, and light and mutual
admiration.'
Mr Kinnock, who will soon take up his post as a European commissioner in
Brussels, said he would regret to his dying day his failure to lead the
party to victory. Labour's defeat in the 1992 general election had been a
tragedy for the country 'because it extended the years of injustice, waste
and lost opportunities'.
Now the party had a new opportunity and, after Mr Blair's first conference
speech as party leader, the country knew that he could be trusted with the
power of government.
Urging the conference to reject the demand to scrap Trident, Mr Kinnock
underlined the need to keep the trust of the people. He warned that the
weakening of Britain's ability to defend itself would also jeopardise the
chance of further action to achieve mutual and balanced reductions of all
armaments.

FT  06 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Nursery education to be made
a duty
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Delegates approved a resolution calling for the provision of nursery
education to be made a statutory duty for local authorities.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said Labour was already
committed to a 'dramatic extension' of existing facilities.
A Labour government would set targets to establish nursery education as a
right for every three and four-year-old - subject to parental agreement - as
part of a co-ordinated programme of childcare provision.
Mrs Taylor promised that the 'bureaucracy of Tory patronage and sleaze'
would be swept away, as would the centralisation of control of education.
The first quango to go would be the Funding Agency which provides finance
for grant-maintained schools.

FT  06 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Pledges 'would cost Pounds
11.5bn'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the first two days of its annual conference Labour made commitments which
will increase annual public spending by more than Pounds 11.5bn, according
to the Conservatives.
In contrast to the view at the Blackpool gathering that Labour has not made
specific commitments, Tory researchers claimed they had already found Pounds
11.57bn worth of Labour spending pledges.
Publishing its Labour Spendometer, the Conservative Research Department said
it had totalled all spending promises made in conference motions that the
National Executive Committee was supporting, and in speeches by
frontbenchers during the first two days of the conference.
The Tory document states that a fixed statutory minimum wage at half median
male earnings - or just over Pounds 4 an hour - would add about Pounds 1.5bn
a year to the public-sector pay bill.
It did not refer to Mr Tony Blair's refusal to commit Labour to fixing a
firm figure before the general election.

FT  06 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Blair wins shift in policy on
united Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair yesterday forced through a historic shift in his party's
policy on Ireland when the Labour conference dropped its commitment to
campaign for unity between the north and the south.
Following the recent IRA ceasefire, the conference overwhelmingly accepted a
statement by Labour's national executive committee which stressed that there
could be a united Ireland only with the consent of its people.
The change in policy, which means that Labour will no longer persuade
unionists to accept unification, follows a campaign by Mr Blair to move his
party away from its traditional pro-nationalist stance.
However, some nationalists in the party maintained last night that they had
forced the Labour leadership to a compromise. They said a composite
resolution also passed by the conference yesterday put pressure on the
unionists to accept a constitutional settlement between north and south.
The NEC statement marks a substantial move in favour of unionist opinion in
the province by stating that 'there can be no change in the constitutional
status of Northern Ireland without the consent of its people'. It adds that
'it is for the people of Ireland alone to exercise their right of
self-determination'.
Some party leaders had feared that Mr Blair's determination to change policy
might trigger a row. But he has successfully convinced colleagues that
Labour's campaign for a united Ireland was outdated and could have damaged
prospects for permanent peace.
Addressing the conference yesterday, Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern
Ireland spokesman, underlined the extent of Mr Blair's success in persuading
colleagues to change course. Mr McNamara is regarded as one of Labour's
strongest pro-nationalists. But he emphasised that a united Ireland was the
best solution 'in the long run' - a phrase which implied to many delegates
that it has gone on the policy back-burner.
Nationalists claimed that the composite resolution passed by conference
contained a greater commitment to unification than the NEC statement.
In particular, the composite puts pressure on unionist politicians by
arguing that 'the intransigence of any party, group or individual should not
be permitted to veto discussions or any move along the path to peace'.
However, there was reassurance for Ulster's Protestant community from Mr
John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, who
addressed a packed session of the conference.
Mr Hume, who was given a standing ovation, urged a 'dual referendum' in
Ulster and the Irish Republic to give people a say on any outcome from
cross-party talks.

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The conference yesterday reaffirmed the decision taken last year to use
quotas to ensure that Labour has more women MPs in the next parliament, Ivor
Owen writes.
Ms Clare Short, shadow cabinet member with responsibility for women,
forecast that as a result there would be between 80 and 90 women on the
Labour benches compared with the present 38.
All-woman shortlists are to be used in half of all 'winnable seats' that
become vacant.
Ms Short successfully called for the approval of a statement by the national
executive committee urging 'flexibility and sensitivity' in operating quotas
under an agreed system of regional consensus. She said there was no other
way of 'guaranteeing progress'.
Ms Short challenged those who argued that merit alone should determine the
choice of parliamentary candidates to say if they believed that most MPs
were second rate because they were selected from an all-male shortlist.

FT  06 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Shadow cabinet braced for a
radical shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair's dramatic conference promise to deliver rapid change has
fuelled hopes among supporters that he is planning a wide-ranging shadow
cabinet shake-up.
Mr Blair is believed to be unhappy with the composition of the shadow
cabinet - elected by Labour MPs at the start of each parliamentary year -
and is said to be keen to keep up the momentum of change.
He has made no changes since succeeding John Smith as party leader in July
and is said to regard the elections as an opportunity to speed up the pace
of party modernisation.
Friends point out that he has already moved to replace Mr Larry Whitty, the
traditionalist general secretary, who will take up a new job as European
co-ordinator later this year. Nominations for the job closed on Tuesday. Mr
Tom Sawyer, a close union ally of Mr Blair, is regarded as certain to be
appointed.
Mr Blair's freedom to reshape the shadow cabinet will depend on the election
results, to be announced later this month. Mr Blair and Mr John Prescott,
the deputy leader, will sit on the shadow cabinet as of right, creating two
election vacancies.
Some members, notably Mr Derek Foster, the chief whip, believe that they
have secured sufficient nominations to be certain of survival.
Senior shadow ministers say that several members are at risk, however,
opening the way for fresh
These include Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, and Mr Tom
Clarke, shadow overseas development minister, who are thought to have made
insufficient impact. Some MPs say that the two men are threatened by the
breakdown of an informal electoral pact between Scottish and north-eastern
MPs which has previously increased the prospects of candidates from those
regions.
Mr Blair is expected to demote Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary,
who is regarded as uninspiring. He is thought likely to promote Mr Chris
Smith, the environment spokesman, and Ms Marjorie Mowlam, a close ally who
failed this week to achieve election to the ruling national executive
committee.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, is regarded as a strong
candidate to replace Mr Cunningham and Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment
secretary, is tipped to replace Mr Prescott at employment. Mrs Margaret
Beckett, the former deputy leader, is certain to be elected and will be
offered a senior role such as the home office, employment or trade and
industry.
Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary, is expected to do well after
performing more strongly this year. Ms Harman lost her place last year after
failing to dent Mr Michael Portillo, the then chief secretary to the
Treasury.
Several newcomers are also expected to do well, including Ms Hilary
Armstrong, who was Mr Smith's parliamentary private secretary.
MPs said that Mr Kevin McNamara, a co-opted member who serves as shadow
Northern Ireland secretary, was likely to survive, in spite of speculation
that he would lose his job, after backing Mr Blair's shift away from
Labour's commitment to campaigning for a united Ireland.
Others regarded as good outside bets include Mr Brian Wilson, a junior
transport spokesman, and Mr Alastair Darling, the City spokesman. Ms Joyce
Quin, who speaks on European affairs, may also win substantial support.

FT  06 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank: Economists go back to school - Basic
training in Kiev
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL BARSHAY and CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Ukraine first became an independent state, cabinet ministers were apt
to telephone western journalists in a frantic search for an explanation of
basic economic terms such as 'balance of payments'.
Three years later, Kiev has a small but aggressive team of economists who
last week negotiated a Dollars 360m (Pounds 240m) loan with the
International Monetary Fund - Ukraine's first IMF deal - and hope to launch
a coherent programme of market reforms this month.
A World Bank public education project being piloted in Ukraine has played a
quiet but crucial role in the transformation of at least a small part of
Kiev's parochial elite, trained only in obediently fulfilling the Kremlin's
central plan, into leaders with a working knowledge of market economics.
For a year, Mr Daniel Kaufmann, World Bank representative in Kiev, has been
running economic round-tables for politicians and civil servants, more
formal seminars and workshops for government bureaucrats, and one-to-one
economic training courses for key would-be reformers.
The most able ministers and civil servants in the Ukrainian government are
alumni of this project. They remain outnumbered by anti-reformist Ukrainian
leaders, who have begun to snipe at the IMF deal, but Mr Kaufmann claims to
'convert' one or two members of Ukraine's communist-dominated parliament
every week.
The project began when Mr Kaufmann realised that meetings between senior
Ukrainian leaders and World Bank and International Monetary Fund delegations
were 'dialogues of the deaf' in which the Ukrainians solemnly nodded their
heads but understood nothing.
That experience convinced Mr Kaufmann that before starting standard
development projects geared at bolstering market reforms, the World Bank (if
Ukraine eventually negotiates a stand-by IMF agreement) could provide Kiev
with a rehabilitation loan of up to Dollars 600m, needed to help Ukrainians
learn what a market economy is.
'The conventional World Bank approach may have served us well in Latin
America and much of Asia where the economic elite which really rules had a
solid western education,' Mr Kaufmann says.
'But this is not the case in the former Soviet Union, eastern and central
Europe and much of Africa.'
Mr Kaufmann also points out that because of the high general level of
education, particularly in maths and the sciences, in the former Soviet
Union and eastern Europe, public education in economics gives rapid results.
'The returns to relatively small, focused investment are enormous, extremely
steep,' Mr Kaufmann says. 'This is not a 15- or 20-year proposition. The
goal is to make ourselves irrelevant in two years.'
Mr Kaufmann began the programme using funds from his office's operating
budget and small sums of money contributed by western governments, but his
initial success has won the admiration of Mr George Soros, the American
financier and philanthropist, who announced last week he would like to
finance a Ukrainian centre to co-ordinate public economic education.
As the World Bank assesses a half-century of operation, Mr Kaufmann hopes
his project will become a model for a new approach in the bank, better
suited, at least initially, to the regions in which the bank operates than
the large projects which have been its traditional mainstay.

FT  06 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank: IFC investment firstfor South Africans

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group,
yesterday announced its first equity investments in South Africa as part of
a strategy to encourage new businesses among the country's poor black
population.
Mr Jemal-ud-din Kassum, IFC vice-president for operations, said that the
investments - which will be made in a franchise financing fund and a life
assurance company - would 'help bridge the gap between the first and third
world parts of the economy'.
The IFC, which promotes private sector activity, will invest R12.5m (Pounds
2.4m) in the South Africa Franchise Capital Fund. This will be a R50m
vehicle to provide loans and equity to members of 'previously disadvantaged
groups' so they can acquire franchises in businesses such as fast food, dry
cleaning and photocopying chains.
The IFC will also invest R41.6m in a 10 per cent stake in African Life
Assurance (Aflife), a life assurance company that does most of its business
with poor blacks. The franchise fund will help black businesses overcome
shortages of capital and give them access to accounting and marketing
expertise as well as the research and development facilities of larger
organisations, Mr Tei Mante, director of IFC's sub-Saharan Africa
department, said.
The life assurance company, which is being restructured to be predominantly
owned by black interests, will provide a home for savings from people in the
townships and provinces. The two investments 'are all part of building a
climate that provides a stable base for economic growth', Mr Mante said.
The Aflife restructuring, which will entail the building up of a new sales
force to cover black residential areas, was an 'example of the changes in
ownership and control that are necessary for increased participation by
previously disadvantaged groups in the formal economy.'
IFC's partner in structuring and arranging the leasing fund was Nedcor Bank
of South Africa.
Nedcor will take a 25 per cent stake in the fund. The rest of the shares
will be placed with a small group of international and South African
institutional investors.
In remarks to the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank, Mr Christo Liebenberg, the South African finance minister, said
the Bank's multilateral investment guarantee agency would soon give its
first guarantee for an inward investment into South Africa.
It is understood that this concerns an investment in the manufacturing
sector.

FT  06 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank: Why World Bank is shifting policy - Private
sector needs more aid to finance infrastructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by the World Bank to increase sharply the financial guarantees
it makes to commercial lenders recognises that private-sector investors need
more help if they are to finance a growing proportion of the world's
infrastructure.
Governments struggling to contain public spending are unable to meet all the
demands from their populations for better transport, power, water and
sewerage systems.
Private-sector lenders and investors, on the other hand, are reluctant to
put money into emerging countries with little history of private-sector
investment and where strong political risks may remain.
Commercial banks lending to these countries demand higher interest rates and
are reluctant to grant long-term loans.
Partial financial guarantees from the the World Bank would provide comfort
to other lenders and allow schemes to proceed which otherwise might not have
taken place, says Dr Ashoka Mody, principal financial economist at the
bank's project finance group.
The Bank, which previously has lent mainly to state bodies would still be
required under its articles to seek counter-guarantees from the government
of the country in which the project was located.
In return, it would guarantee commercial lenders against the failure of
state agencies to meet contractual obligations.
These might include:
Maintaining agreed tariff formulas and regulatory frameworks;
Making available sufficient fuel, in the case of a power station;
Meeting payment targets where these have been agreed with state and
municipal authorities
Providing compensation for delays caused by government actions or political
events.
The Bank, however, would not cover commercial risks such as construction
delays, inadequate costing or the failure of customers to purchase services
in expected numbers.
'We want to use guarantees as a catalyst. By covering some of the risks that
the commercial market is not able to bear or evaluate adequately, we hope to
attract new sources of finance, reduce funding costs overall and extend the
maturity of commercial loans,' said Dr Mody.
The decision to increase the availability of financial guarantees to the
private sector represents a marked shift in the bank's policy.
The Bank has total outstanding loans of Dollars 104bn (Pounds 69.3bn),
mostly to governments and government agencies, compared with financial
guarantees to commercial lenders covering just Dollars 1bn of loans.
The Bank's size, credit rating, special relationships with governments and
experience in negotiating counter-guarantees means it is better suited to
support large-scale projects than the International Finance Corporation, the
World Bank's commercial lending arm, and the Multilateral Investment
Guarantee Agency which deals in areas considered politically risky.
The IFC and MIGA, which traditionally have provided smaller loans,
guarantees and credit insurance to the private sector will continue these
operations but the Bank is expected to take the lead role on big
privately-financed projects.
Dr Mody, speaking in London at a Financial Times conference on
infrastructure investments, said financial guarantees had already helped a
small number of infrastructure projects raise private capital more cheaply.
A partial credit guarantee covering 22 per cent of the present value of a
Dollars 120m loan from commercial banks and insurance companies had enabled
Chinese authorities to extend the maturity of the loan from 5 to 15 years
for the Dollars 1.08bn Yangzhou thermal power project.
Similar World Bank support for a Dollars 100m bond issue for the Leyte-Luzon
geothermal project in the Philippines had extended the payment period from
10 to 15 years. The bank's support was equivalent to 36 per cent of the
credit risk exposure at present values.
The fees for such deals typically are expected to be 0.25 per cent during
the life of the guarantee.
This however would rise to between 0.4 and 1 per cent during the danger
period when the guarantee might be triggered.
In the case of the China and Philippines power projects, the promoters were
the state while the World Bank guarantees covered credit rather than
contractual risk.
In future, deals will be done directly with private lenders and promoters
and cover both contractual and credit risk of state bodies defaulting on
payments.
Developing countries are estimated to spend about Dollars 200bn on
infrastructure investment, of which about 90 per cent comes from government
sources.
The proportion paid for by private investors is forecast to rise sharply
over the next few years and the World Bank expects to play an increasing
role in assisting this market.

FT  06 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank: Low mobility hits Russian jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regional unemployment levels in Russia, ranging between 1 and 11 per cent of
the workforce, are likely to become entrenched because of low labour
mobility, according to a World Bank report.
The report says the national unemployment rate is between 5 and 6 per cent,
as opposed to the official rate of about 2 per cent, but finds the duration
of unemployment is surprisingly short.
'Unlike in eastern Europe, where unemployment turnover is very small,
Russian unemployment, at least as yet, cannot be characterised as a stagnant
pool,' the report written by Mr Simon Commander and Mr Ruslan Yemstov says.
In 1993, between 60 and 80 per cent of those leaving unemployment did so
within four months.
In any quarter of 1993 roughly 5 per cent of the workforce made a job
transition.
Big Russian companies have generally held on to their workers even when
demand has slumped, but they have also been surprisingly persistent in
hiring. Sackings remain responsible for only 25 per cent of job movement
from companies, implying that a lot of people are switching jobs
voluntarily.
There are, however, some growing problems of 'mis-match' between supply and
demand in the labour market. 'In Moscow, for example, most posted vacancies
are for manual and primarily male jobs; a significant share of the
unemployed are educated women.'

<TEXT>
The Japanese government is planning significantly to increase public
spending over the next 10 years in an effort to expand domestic demand and
improve the nation's living standards.
Mr Kozo Igarashi, chief cabinet secretary, confirmed that the government was
working on a new public spending programme which is expected to increase
investment to about Y630,000bn (Pounds 4,100bn) over 10 years from 1995.
The programme will replace the current one which began in 1991, for which
Y430,000bn has been earmarked.
The beefed-up programme, expected to be put before the cabinet tomorrow for
approval, follows Japan's pledge at the Group of Seven summit in Naples last
July to review the existing spending programme with a view to stimulating
the domestic economy further.
In addition to increased public spending, the programme will call for
greater allocation of funds to the building of social infrastructure, to
improve the country's living standards and prepare for an ageing society.
Increased housing, drainage, garbage treatment facilities and educational
and social welfare issues are among priority candidates for increased
investment.
The plan is expected to call for greater investment in lifts in public
places and wider sidewalks to accommodate wheelchairs.
The programme will also aim to meet the changing needs of a society in which
information is expected to play an increasingly important role.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Nigeria may rotate presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ABUJA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A constitutional conference organised by Nigeria's military government
agreed yesterday the national presidency should rotate between north and
south, an issue at the heart of the country's prolonged crisis, Reuter
reports from Abuja.
The decision, which must be approved by the ruling junta, followed heated
argument over power-sharing.
'In view of the controversy, it should therefore be enshrined in the
constitution that the presidency of the Federal Republic of Nigeria be
rotated between north and south; this will be drafted appropriately in the
constitution,' Justice Adolphus Karibi-Whyte, conference chairman, ruled.
Northerners, often generals, have ruled Nigeria for most of the time since
independence from Britain in 1960. A political crisis ensued after Mr
Moshood Abiola, a business tycoon from the south-west, apparently won a
presidential election in June 1993 which the general then in power annulled.
General Sani Abacha, the present ruler, seized power last November and has
touted the conference as a first step towards restoring democracy. Mr Abiola
is on trial for alleged treason.
Last week, southern states insisted that rotation of power among six ethnic
groupings should be entrenched in the constitution.
Northern states opposed this, saying it should be left to political parties
to ensure they varied their choice of presidential candidates among the
regions.
Tribal and regional concerns are a delicate issue in the vast country, where
more than 1m people died in the 1966-70 Biafra secessionist war. About 47m
people live in the mainly Moslem north, compared with 41m in the largely
Christian south. The country has more than 300 ethnic groups.

South Korea will raise its ceiling on foreign stock investments from 10 to

Mr Park Jae-yoon, the new finance minister, said yesterday.
It is the first increase in the foreign shareholding ceiling since the Seoul
bourse was opened to foreign investors in January 1992.
Foreign investors have pushed for a higher limit since the shareholding
quota has long been filled for the country's most attractive stocks.
The Seoul bourse still remains one of the most closed in Asia to foreign
investors, who now control 8.6 per cent of market capitalisation with a
total of Dollars 9.2bn (Pounds 6.1bn) in net investments at the end of
August. Leading investments come from the US with Dollars 2.8bn, the UK with
Dollars 2.45bn and New Zealand with Dollars 417m.
The two percentage point increase will allow an extra inflow of Dollars
2.9bn from overseas into the market.
The 8 per cent foreign shareholding limit on Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco)
and Korea Electric Power (Kepco), the two largest state-controlled
companies, will be raised to 10 per cent next year.
Posco and Kepco are also scheduled to become the first Korean companies to
be listed on the New York Stock Exchange later this month.
The finance ministry has resisted a rise in the ceiling because of worries
that the capital inflow would increase inflationary pressure.
In addition, Korean companies feared that a new influx of foreign capital
would cause an appreciation of the Korean won, which would dampen exports.
But the ministry finally bowed to growing pressure to increase the limit as
Korea prepares to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development in 1996.
The Korean general share index has surged to record high levels in recent
weeks as domestic investors bought blue-chip stocks in anticipation that the
foreign shareholding ceiling would be raised and further increase stock
prices.
The change had already been planned to be announced this week in connection
with the annual meeting of the World Bank/IMF, before Mr Park's appointment
as the new finance minister on Tuesday.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Patten offers olive branch to China
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Chris Patten, the Hong Kong governor, yesterday offered a working-level
role to members of Beijing's shadow Hong Kong cabinet, in a concession aimed
at breaking the deadlock on the colony's transition to Chinese sovereignty.
The concession, outlined in a policy speech to the Legislative Council
(LegCo), marks recognition of Beijing's Preliminary Working Committee, set
up by China when Sino-British talks on Mr Patten's democratic reform
programme broke down in acrimony last year.
Until now, the government has been wary of the PWC, which some say could
erode the authority of the colonial government, and contacts between the
body and Hong Kong civil servants have been limited.
Now, PWC members have been invited to share in expert-level talks of the
Joint Liaison Group (JLG), the official channel for transitional issues, in
a bid to speed negotiations. The JLG's work has decelerated sharply since
agreement was reached on the transfer of military land last June.
Two big infrastructure projects, a new airport and extension of the port,
have already fallen victim to JLG inertia, while local enactment of laws,
rights of residency and air services agreements are among the issues
remaining on the agenda.
Mr Patten said: 'What's of primary concern to us, without being ideological
about our relations with the PWC, is how we can give more impetus to the JLG
and how, in due course, we can co-operate with the Preparatory Committee (to
be established in 1996) and the Chief Executive-designate.'
Mr Patten's gesture, however, was shot down by Beijing even before he stood
up to speak, with the official Xinhua news agency saying Britain lacked
sincerity when it spoke of a desire to improve co-operation and questioning
the validity of involving the PWC.
Mr Patten said he was surprised by Beijing's statement: 'I thought that's
what the PWC is supposed to do,' he said. He further added that Hong Kong
people would be puzzled if Beijing failed to provide a positive response to
his speech over the coming weeks, saying he was hoping for the best.
News of a softer stance on the PWC had already been carried to Mr Qian
Qichen, China's foreign minister, by Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign
secretary, when the two met in New York last week.
In his speech yesterday, Mr Patten said: 'We have indicated to the Chinese
side our willingness to explore further with them whether there are informal
ways in which this can be achieved, perhaps by expanding the pool of
expertise on which the JLG can draw. Members of the PWC for example may be
able to contribute to this process. We would welcome that.'
In a further attempt to speed the 'snail's pace' of the JLG work, Mr Patten
outlined a raft of issues on which Hong Kong would provide practical aid to
the incoming government and related bodies ahead of the transition. These
matters span the layers of future government, defence (under the People's
Liberation Army after the handover), HKDollars 120bn (Pounds 10bn)-worth of
fiscal reserves plus Exchange Fund assets, infrastructure and the 1997
budget.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Indian minister faces scandal inquiry

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India's criminal board of investigation (CBI) said yesterday it was
continuing to investigate claims that a cabinet minister was involved in an
Rs1.32bn (Pounds 26.7m) illegal financing scheme in a case arising from the
1992 Bombay securities market scandal.
Mr B Shankaranand, the health and welfare minister, is accused of having
authorised the diversion of funds from the state-owned oil industry
development board (OIDB) to the syndicate bank, a banking institution, so
that it could be, illegally, invested in the stock market.
Mr Shankaranand was oil minister and OIDB chairman at the time of the
alleged fund transfers in 1992. He denies any wrong-doing.
The scandal centred on the illegal transfer of funds from banks into the
stock market in order to try to make speculative profits, which were shared
out among the banks, stockbrokers and bank clients, including private
companies and state-owned enterprises.
Details of OIDB's transactions were published in a report of a joint
parliamentary committee into the scandal last year. It concluded Mr
Shankaranand had violated prudential norms in his supervision of OIDB's
financial investments. Mr Shankaranand's denials were included in a
government report published in response to the parliamentary report.
Paul Taylor adds: More than half the banks implicated in the Bombay
securities scandal have paid their fines, according to the Reserve Bank of
India.
The Indian central bank, which earlier this week imposed new penalties on
three more small banks, said 14 banks had so far paid the fines, which were
imposed for alleged breaches of its rules on securities transactions.
In July the central bank imposed fines totalling Rs1.47bn on 20 commercial
banks, including foreign banks, which were severely criticised in a
parliamentary report into the scandal published in December and were held
liable for the bulk - Rs1.24bn - of the fines.

FT  06 OCT 94 / A sunny spot in grey Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
On the Japanese Regional Banking Association's latest regional banking
'weather' map, which indicates the strength of the local economies, the only
sunny area in the country was the southern island of Kyushu.
Although the recent spate of economic data has indicated that Japan is
facing a lacklustre recovery, businesses in Kyushu are feeling more
confident than their counterparts elsewhere in the country.
Part of the cheer stems from the minimal effects of the asset 'bubble' of
the late 1980s. Unlike the economies surrounding the larger cities such as
Tokyo and Osaka, which have been hit by the plunge in real estate prices,
Kyushu was relatively unaffected by speculative activity.
Confidence is also supported by Kyushu's provincial governments, striving to
become the main crossroads for Japan and south-east Asia, which have been
pumping capital into infrastructure projects in the region.
Sports facilities and hotels are being built for next year's Universiade
games in Fukuoka city. Convention and shopping complexes are expected to be
built before the Asia Development Bank's convention there in 1997.
Kyushu has been seeing the benefits of capital investment by leading
manufacturers over the past few years. Nissan Motor and Toyota Motor both
have plants, along with companies in the semiconductor industry such as
Iwashita Engineering, and Mitsui High-Tech.
The main attraction for companies is cheap labour and land prices. Nissan's
Zama plant on the outskirts of Tokyo is estimated to be worth Y240,000
(Pounds 1,558) a sq m, but Toyota reportedly paid Y16,000 to Y17,000 a sq m
for its Kyushu plant.
Another is that 'the proximity to south-east Asia is a leading advantage for
companies moving into Kyushu', says Mr James Fiorillo, analyst at brokers
Baring Securities in Tokyo. Mr Hiroshi Morimoto at the Kyushu Economic
Research Centre adds that Kyushu will become an important back-up base for
companies which have moved their manufacturing bases to Asia.
The increase in population as a result of the investments has supported
consumption in the region. July department store sales in Kyushu were up 1.2
per cent on July of 1993, in spite of a 29-month consecutive decline for the
nation.
The Fukuoka stock exchange, which expects new listings of about 10 companies
this fiscal year to March, saw trading volume rise by 4.5 times in June from
a year earlier, and 7 times in July.
Lending growth at Kyushu-based regional banks has been steady in spite of
the first fall in loan growth on record experienced by the country's large
commercial banks. Bank of Fukuoka, says outstanding lending rose 2.9 per
cent in August to Y3,988bn.
The real test will come when the wave of investments recedes. Some bankers
are already cautious. 'We aren't sure if there will be enough demand once
the facilities and hotels are finished,' says Mr Toshihide Marutani, an
official at the Bank of Fukuoka's economic research department.
Others believe the region's growth will be sustained as long as the rest of
the country catches up.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Cardoso faces some hard choices: There are worrying signs of
inflation reviving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, probably Brazil's next president, will inherit
an economy apparently in its best shape for years. The new Real currency,
which he planned when finance minister, is backed by Dollars 40bn of foreign
reserves and has cut monthly inflation from 50 per cent in June to less than
2 per cent last month. This year's per capita growth is forecast at 2 per
cent, while exports are at record levels.
But serious problems stemming from years of high inflation and political
interference in the economy, remain. Unless Mr Cardoso acts quickly,
inflation could return to undermine the credibility he has built with the
Real.
Inflation may already be increasing by the time he takes over on January 1.
Some food prices are rising because of a drought. Businesses are likely to
raise prices in the run-up to Christmas, especially now the election is
over. Consumer demand has risen sharply since the Real's launch, because the
fall in inflation has left poorer consumers better off. August sales of
televisions were 85 per cent up on a year ago and Sao Paulo's factories are
the busiest since 1989.
These signals of higher inflation are worrying, although most analysts
expect the outgoing government's tight hold on credit and interest rates
will stop any rapid rise. 'Increasing demand worries me but it is not an
explosion and it is controllable,' said Mr Mailson da Nobrega, former
finance minister, who estimates inflation will remain at 2-3 per cent a
month this year.
A bigger threat on the inflation front comes from the government's finances.
Part of the reason for the Real's success was that the government managed to
balance this year's budget, helped by one-off spending cuts and higher than
expected tax revenues. Next year the picture is less promising. An emergency
tax on bank accounts, which raises about Dollars 6bn annually, runs out this
year. Without a replacement, next year's budget will have a deficit equal to
about 1 per cent of GDP.
Mr Cardoso's advisers are well aware of the budget problems. Reforms to the
fiscal and social security systems which were planned last year when he was
finance minister were blocked by Congressional opposition. These changes
include raising taxes and the number of tax payers - only 7m of the
economically active population of 50m pay income tax.
The social security system also needs thorough reform. It is underfunded
and, because of generous benefits such as early retirement introduced in
1988, the social security bill is set to reach Dollars 24.5bn this year,
compared to just Dollars 14.5bn in 1992.
Mr Cardoso's apparent big election victory could give him the momentum to
persuade Congress to pass unpopular measures such as higher taxes or reduced
social benefits. But such reforms would not take effect until 1996 or even
1997, prompting observers like Mr Nobrega to call for a speeded up
privatisation programme.
There is increasing consensus in the private sector that these reforms are
needed and that the state's role in the economy should be reduced.
Politicians, who often use the state for private purposes, or to win
elections, will need more persuasion.
For example, Sao Paulo is Brazil's most important state economically, but
has a budget deficit equal to three years of tax revenues because of
successive years of bad government. It owes about Dollars 7bn to its state
owned bank, Banespa, which has had to approve politically inspired lending,
much of which may never be repaid.
Other urgent changes are needed to stop state governments employing
unqualified people ahead of elections in return for their votes. Corruption
and waste is seen as extremely high in the health system, while the federal
and state governments are expensively overstaffed yet rarely even check if
their employees turn up for work.
Mr Eduardo Giannetti, a Sao Paulo-based economist, says Mr Cardoso needs to
confront all these problems and end politicians' control over state banks.
'In the abstract everyone agrees these questions should be tackled, until it
comes down to imposing the loss. A new president has the authority to make
people accept change, but he needs to act quickly. The first year is worth
more than the last three of his mandate,' he says.
With so much remaining to be done, confidence in the Real's future remains
fragile. Unlike other countries fighting inflation, Brazil decided against
making the Real fully convertible or setting it at parity with the US
dollar. Instead, the Real is backed by foreign exchange reserves, and a
government promise not to breach its own money supply targets.
If Mr Cardoso can use his first few months in office to instigate reform of
the state and constitution, his momentum will help underpin the Real and
inflation can be contained. If not, financial markets may lose confidence
and Brazil's inflationary cycle could start again.
'We are not yet talking about (economic) stabilisation achieved. Inflation
could come back and would mean a great loss of respect for democracy. People
would feel they had again been cheated ahead of elections,' said Mr
Giannetti.

<TEXT>
Canada's Liberal government yesterday issued a discussion paper on reforming
the social safety net, aimed at getting all 10 provinces to help improve
work skills and move the jobless away from reliance on unemployment
insurance.
But Mr Lloyd Axworthy, minister of human resources, left his proposals vague
and without cost estimates to try to head off a gathering storm of
provincial opposition.
The government is committed to pruning the social welfare system by several
billion dollars. It now accounts for nearly CDollars 40bn (Pounds 18.8bn) a
year of federal spending.
The proposals include limiting child tax credits to lower income families
and redesigning unemployment insurance, a solely federal programme, to limit
benefits.
Federal funding for university education would also be reformed, while
retirement savings could be tapped to finance university education.

<TEXT>
Caribbean troops and a group of returning Haitian refugees arrived in the
Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince yesterday, which suggests that the US
military believes it is in full control just 10 days before the scheduled
return of exiled President Jean Bertrand Aristide.
The 262 Caricom troops from Jamaica, Trinidad, Belize and Barbados will be
in charge of security at the port in the capital. This has become a vital
task as humanitarian aid begins to pour in now that US troops have set up
distribution networks.
Some 492 refugees arrived from the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.
A total of 14,000 refugees remain outside Haiti, but US officials expect 500
a day to arrive should the country remain calm.
Political tensions have been partly defused by a virtual breakdown in the
Haitian police force now that its leader, Lt Col Michel Francois, has fled
to the Dominican Republic.
Police officers were completely absent from Haitian streets yesterday,
remaining at their headquarters even while sporadic looting took place
across the street from the US embassy.
US soldiers have worked with Haitians in recent days to locate the homes of
suspected army auxiliaries, who terrorised the population with their harsh
crackdown against supporters of Mr Aristide.
But with thousands of weapons still reported to be in the hands of
pro-regime auxiliaries and other extremists and some Haitians thirsting for
revenge, the potential for violence remains high.
Parliament yesterday continued to debate the granting of a general amnesty,
a condition for de facto leader Lt Gen Raoul Cedras to step down, but
appeared unable to arrive at a consensus.

Moody's, the US credit rating agency, said yesterday it might raise its
rating for part of Brazil's foreign debt, Richard Lapper reports. The
action, which affects some Dollars 7.9bn of debt, comes in the wake of Mr
Cardoso's election success this week. Moody's rating on so-called 'interest
due and unpaid' bonds and new money bonds, now B2, could change. The agency
said the review 'is motivated by the likelihood that the incoming
administration will have sufficient power to implement comprehensive
economic and political reforms.' It pointed out that in recent years
Brazil's domestic economy has been relatively dynamic and commercial debt
arrears had been restructured.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Congress abandons Superfund legislation: Clean-up reforms
fail for this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Congressional leaders yesterday abandoned efforts to reform the US's complex
Superfund legislation on the clean-up of toxic waste sites.
The Superfund reform was once expected to be a centrepiece of President Bill
Clinton's environmental programme this year, but it died yesterday, a
victim, like so many other measures blocked in the closing days of the
congressional session, of fierce Republican opposition.
Although a series of objections from industries affected by the legislation
have been resolved over the year, the Superfund reform bill's sponsors
failed to clear aside all the obstacles that have prevented it from coming
to a vote in either chamber of Congress.
Although some members claimed there was still a chance of winning both votes
and then reconciling the Senate and House of Representatives versions, this
was generally regarded as wildly unrealistic in the three days remaining
before Congress is due to break up for the election campaign.
The original 1980 Superfund law aimed to clean up toxic waste sites by
requiring polluters to clean up dumps listed by the Environmental Protection
Agency. But that law has turned into an administrative nightmare, with more
time and money spent on lawsuits over who should be held responsible than on
the actual clean-ups.
An attempt to overhaul the law in 1986 left many problems unresolved, and
this year's reform effort by Ms Carol Browner, head of the EPA, has
attracted the support of an unusual alliance of chemical companies,
insurers, mayors, small businesses and some environmentalist groups.
'The bills before Congress would have greatly improved public involvement in
clean-up decisions, cut litigation costs, brought consistency and
transparency to clean-up decisions and retained the core principle of
'polluter pays',' said Mr William Roberts, legislative director of the
Environmental Defense Fund.
The overhaul was still opposed, however, by reinsurers and a portion of the
environmentalist community.
'This whole thing is about saving the money of the polluters, and that
should be the last thing on anyone's mind,' said Mr Rick Hind of Greenpeace,
an environmental organisation opposed to the bill.
Both supporters and opponents of the Superfund reform bill said the central
role in killing the measure was the hostility of Senator Bob Dole, leader of
the Republican minority in the Senate.
Mr Dole has argued that any reform must remove one of Superfund's most
controversial elements: the application of retroactive liability to anyone
involved with a polluted site. But his principal motivation is widely
believed to be his determination to deny the Clinton administration even the
slightest legislative victory in the closing days of the congressional
session.
Industry groups that might, in theory, have benefited from the changes Mr
Dole sought had begged him in vain to let the bill go forward.
Other bills on the Clinton administration's environmental agenda, including
tighter controls on mining and grazing on federal land and the
transformation of the EPA into a full cabinet department have already fallen
by the wayside.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Determined Republicans halt progress on Clinton agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
As the day dawned yesterday, there were three Republican filibusters holding
up bills in the Senate, and more threatened. By mid-morning the opposition
had scored in the House, forcing a delay of at least 24 hours of a floor
vote on the Gatt treaty.
Across the legislative spectrum, measures that had once seemed certain of
passage - often those which had already passed both chambers in different
forms - were held in jeopardy by the Republican determination to block
virtually every bill that could conceivably be interpreted as a success for
President Bill Clinton and the Democratic party.
The rules of Congress allow different methods of obstruction to be freely
deployed. In the 100-member Senate, this may take the form of the simple
filibuster, which normally requires 60 votes to override but under some
circumstances two-thirds of those present. This hurdle has often been too
high for the Democrats, who have a 56-44 nominal majority but face not only
Republican solidarity but also defections from their own ranks.
Senate rules also permit 30 hours for debate after a filibuster has been
defeated. This has already been employed on both major and minor issues,
such as nominations to federal office, thus squeezing the calendar even
further before the scheduled adjournment at the end of this week.
The Gatt delay in the House was also the result of a parliamentary device,
with Republicans demanding that the rule under which the trade treaty would
be debated be changed so as to allow further investigation of one provision.
Specifically, Congressman Newt Gingrich, the Republican whip, is objecting
to the so-called telecommunications 'pioneer preference' clause in the bill
covering fees to be paid by licensees of advanced cellular phone technology.
This is part of the revenue-raising exercise required to offset any losses
from lower tariffs.
Mr Gingrich, a clear leader of the conservative forces in Congress, has made
much of the fact that the Washington Post Company, owner of the capital's
liberal newspaper, is a large investor in this technology. A Post editorial
yesterday flatly denied, however, that it was receiving favourable
treatment.
Mr Gingrich is also the architect of Senate obstruction of the lobbying
reform bill, now also held hostage in spite of the fact that it first passed
the chamber by a 95-4 vote. United We Stand, the political organisation set
up by Mr Ross Perot, the 1992 independent presidential candidate, has also
demanded that the bill be passed.
Public disgust with Congress is such that failure to act may rebound on
incumbents in the mid-term elections on November 8. But this suits the
Republicans, since far more Democrats are up for re-election.
Mr Gingrich's artful argument is that the bill would circumscribe the
constitutional right to petition the government - especially by religious
groups, the most vocal and conservative of which are, of course, staunchly
Republican.
The mood of Congress, matching that of the country, is now foul. Even one
Republican, Senator John McCain of Arizona, observed: 'Most Americans want
us to get out of town - they think we have already done enough harm.' One
anonymous Democrat acidly said: 'There is nothing the Republicans want -
except our jobs.'

FT  06 OCT 94 / Chip research consortium to shun federal funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sematech, the US government- backed semiconductor industry research
consortium, will pay its own way and no longer accept direct federal funding
after fiscal 1996, it said in Washington yesterday.
Formed in 1987, when the US semiconductor industry was rapidly losing ground
to the Japanese and falling behind in chip manufacturing technology,
Sematech has for seven years received half of its funds, or about Dollars
90m (Pounds 57m) a year, from the Defence Department's Advanced Research
Projects Agency. The rest is paid by member companies.
Leaders of the consortium, which includes 11 of the largest US chip makers,
said a resurgence in their international competitiveness and the increased
profitability of the industry, which last year regained world market
leadership for the first time since 1985, meant Sematech no longer needs
government support.
'It is a matter of principle,' said Mr Craig Barrett, chief operating
officer of Intel, the world's largest chip maker, and a member of the
Sematech board of directors.
'The industry can now afford to support the consortium and we should. We are
setting an example for other US industries and for the world.'
'We never intended direct federal funding to become an entitlement
programme,' said Mr Bill Spencer, Sematech president and chief executive.
Ironically, the consortium is turning down government money at a time when
it has the whole-hearted support of the Clinton administration - after years
of battling political opponents to maintain funding from Presidents Reagan
and Bush.
Sematech has long been at the centre of US debate over 'industrial policy'
with critics - mostly Republicans - charging that the government was
'picking winners and losers'. It has been supported by the Pentagon,
however, amid concerns the US might lose its leadership in technology vital
to national security.
The decision to reject further funding has met a mixture of praise,
disbelief and suspicion from members of Congress, industry executives said.
'We expected a pat on the back. Instead, we have been accused by some of
rocking the boat.'
Sematech's decision has confounded critics and supporters alike. To critics,
it is a surprising demonstration that this is not just another industry
group looking to sustain itself at the federal trough. Supporters, on the
other hand, are concerned that without the incentive of money, Sematech may
no longer be a 'model' of government-industry collaboration.
However, Sematech officials stressed that they aimed to expand, rather than
end, co-operation between the private and public sectors and that the
consortium would compete for government research grants for specific project
on the same basis as other groups and companies. Ultimately, this could mean
that Sematech will receive more government funding than its current annual
stipend.
Working through the congressionally mandated, but yet to be formed,
Semiconductor Technology Council, an advisory group of government, industry
and academic representatives, Sematech aims to influence a broader spectrum
of government spending including Commerce Department and Energy Department
research programmes, as well as the Pentagon.
Total federal government spending on semiconductor-related research has been
running at about Dollars 2bn to Dollars 2.5bn in recent years, Sematech
estimates. 'If we can influence just 10 per cent of that so that it has
commercial relevance we will be able to more than double the impact that we
have had,' said Mr Frank Squires, Sematech's chief administrative officer.
There is little possibility of the semiconductor industry reverting to its
traditional 'arms-length and sometimes adversarial relationship with the
federal government', Mr Squires said.
Public attitudes in the US towards the government's role in ensuring
economic security, employment and the creation of 'quality' jobs have
changed, he believes. 'Perhaps Sematech has helped to bring about that
change by demonstrating that not every government-industry partnership is
larded with pork and bureaucracy.'

FT  06 OCT 94 / Orders for US goods up 4.4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
New orders for US manufactured goods jumped 4.4 per cent to Dollars 286.5bn
(Pounds 182bn) in August, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The
increase more than offset a 2 per cent drop the previous month, and is the
sharpest monthly increase in nearly two years.
The rise included an unexpectedly steep increase in orders for non-durable
goods, which rose by 2.5 per cent in August to Dollars 132.3bn. This was the
10th month in succession in which non-durable goods orders increased, with
all leading industries except leather contributing to the rise.
Orders for durable goods rose by 6.1 per cent to Dollars 154.2bn, a
fractionally bigger increase than the Commerce Department had announced in
its advance durable goods report a week ago.
Coupled with the 0.6 per cent rise in the August index of leading economic
indicators announced by the department on Tuesday, the rise added fuel to
the financial markets' growing conviction that the Federal Reserve will have
to raise interest rates sooner rather than later.
But some economists pointed out the factory orders data still relate to
August, before any effect was likely from the Fed's last interest rates
increase on August 16. More attention is likely to be paid to tomorrow's
employment statistics, which will give the first substantial information on
the economy's strength in September.
The Commerce Department said overall shipments of manufactured goods rose by
4.5 per cent in August to Dollars 287.9bn, after dropping by 1.1 per cent in
July.
The backlog of unfilled orders dropped by 0.3 per cent to Dollars 447.2bn,
cutting the ratio of orders to shipments to 2.89 - the lowest in 30 years.
With inventories dropping by 0.1 per cent to Dollars 387.1bn, the ratio of
inventories to shipments fell to 1.34, the lowest ever recorded.

FT  06 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Commission plans will loosen carmakers'
grip on dealers - John Griffiths explains the impact of changes to EU
regulation of vehicle sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday dismayed consumer groups and brought
relief to car manufacturers by proposing yesterday that the motor industry
keep its selective and exclusive distribution networks for another 10 years.
In a long-awaited draft regulation, the Commission cited the complex nature
of cars and their safety implications as a major reason for continuing to
exempt car manufacturers and their dealers from normal EU competition rules
governing the sale of goods.
After a fierce internal fight between the competition and industry
directorates, the Commission plans to renew, with some alterations, the
so-called block exemption first granted to the European motor industry for
10 years in 1985.
The current exemption expires at the end of next June. There will be a
discussion period of several months. But given the mass of evidence
collected during preparation of the draft document, it is unlikely to change
much before being formally adopted by the Commission - early in the new year
at latest.
The main changes compared with the previous exemption are intended to
achieve several objectives. These include improving the functioning of the
internal market, ensuring a balance between the interests of the parties
concerned and encouraging manufacturer-dealer relations based on
partnership.
In a statement likely further to irritate consumer groups, the Commission
also acknowledged that a factor in retaining the exemption was that the
existing distribution structure allows easy monitoring of Japanese vehicle
movements - and thus helps Commission bureaucrats manage the EC-Japan
'understanding' under which Japanese car imports to the EU are monitored
during the transition to an open EU market for cars by 1999.
The main changes to the exemption affect the balance of power between
manufacturers and their dealers, rather than consumers, although they hold
out the prospect of considerably sharpening competition in the repairs and
service aftermarket. The changes include:
Allowing a dealer to distribute and sell more than one make of vehicle.
This, however, is subject to conditions likely to be found far from
satisfactory by consumer groups. There is no prospect of customers being
able to compare, say, a Fiat Punto with a Ford Fiesta on the same showroom
floor. The draft directive requires separate premises, even if on the same
site, with separate management and 'no possible confusion between the
makes'. Manufacturers will be able to terminate a dealer's contract if the
dealer wishes to distribute other makes, but only if the termination is
based on 'objective criteria'. Arbitrators would be available to settle any
disputes.
Allowing these multi-dealerships will help give dealers greater independence
vis-a-vis manufacturers, claims the Commission.
In some continental European markets such as France, where there are no
large, multi-outlet dealer groups, this change could have considerable
effect. However it will have relatively little impact in the UK, where most
manufacturers have already begun to relax their opposition to
multi-franchising and a number of multi-franchise sites have already
appeared.
The setting of sales targets only by mutual agreement between manufacturers
and dealers: This represents a small but significant shift in the balance of
power between manufacturers and dealers. Currently, manufacturers have the
power effectively to impose sales targets. Frequently dealers have regarded
such targets as unrealistic, and as placing them under excessive pressure to
'move metal'. Again there is provision for arbitration in the event of
disputes, but the precise form of such arbitration last night remained
unclear.
Allowing dealers to obtain spare parts other than those of the manufacturer,
provided they are of equivalent quality: There is an intensively competitive
market for spare parts, with many independent suppliers undercutting
original equipment prices. However, the provision requiring 'equivalent
quality' would appear to give manufacturers considerable leverage over
dealers seeking alternative parts sources.
Allowing independent garage owners access to the technical knowledge
required for repairing vehicles: This measure should act as a benefit to
consumers in stimulating after-sales competition. But manufacturers will
hand over such information very reluctantly and there would appear to be
considerable potential for foot-dragging.
Freedom for dealers to advertise out of their own sales territories: In
effect, the draft merely formalises a practice which is increasingly
widespread, with big dealer groups already advertising in national
publications.
Extension of the minimum duration of agreements between manufacturers and
dealers from four to five years and minimum notice of termination from one
to two years;
A ban on anti-competitive clauses in contracts, on pain of the manufacturer
forfeiting its own exemption from competition rules.
Banning practices designed to discourage consumers of one EU country buying
a new car in another EU state, such as differences in the manufacturer's
remuneration to dealers depending on the place of destination of the
vehicle.

FT  06 OCT 94 / World Trade News: China vows to defy US on Gatt entry terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER, MARTIN WOLF and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China will not drop its demand that it be readmitted to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as a developing country, in spite of US
pressure for it to be classified as a developed nation, a senior Chinese
official said yesterday.
Mr Li Lanqing, a vice-premier responsible for trade, said it would be
'ignorant and absurd' for China to be regarded as a developed country for
the purposes of Gatt entry. 'If we assume the duties of a developed country,
why would we want to rejoin Gatt?' he asked.
His remarks reflect China's determination to preserve its developing country
status in international institutions, thereby protecting benefits such as
concessionary finance and other privileges.
Mr Li, a former foreign trade minister, said China's growing status as a
trading nation demanded that it be a founder member of the World Trade
Organisation, the successor body to Gatt: 'We are now the world's 11th
largest trader. . . Is it possible that the WTO would not include the 11th
largest trading nation? Can it be representative otherwise?'
'If they don't let us rejoin the Gatt, China will manage. . . I just don't
believe that the world can exclude China. It serves nobody's interests.'
Beijing has reduced tariffs on many categories of imports, and has also
dismantled a wide range of non-tariff barriers, but western nations led by
the US are demanding further liberalisation of agricultural markets and
progress in opening up the services sector.
Chinese officials complain frequently about 'unreasonable' US demands, but
negotiations are said to be making progress, although it is not clear
whether they can be concluded in time for China to become a founder member
of the WTO next year.
In Geneva, intensive talks are trying to wrap up the terms of entry to Gatt
and WTO this year.
Trade officials say Gatt's working party on Chinese membership will meet as
soon as there appears to be the basis of a consensus on the accession
protocol and clear progress in parallel talks on improving access to the
Chinese market for imports of goods and services.
Nearly 25 countries and the EU have been negotiating with China over the
past month. However, the most critical talks are those with the US, which
has taken the toughest stance in requiring Beijing to comply with Gatt/WTO
rules from the outset.
China, a founder member, applied to rejoin Gatt in 1986 after pulling out in
1950 following the communist takeover. Membership negotiations began in 1987
but were repeatedly delayed by political and trade rows with Washington.
Reuter adds: US House of Representatives majority whip David Bonior said
yesterday the House planned to delay a final vote on sweeping Gatt
legislation until December, when the Senate is set to vote.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration yesterday said its aggressive year-old trade
promotion strategy had helped US companies win contracts for 70 big foreign
projects worth Dollars 17bn.
'We can now say that the strategy is working and working with successful,
measurable results,' said Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, who heads
the Trade Promotion Co-ordinating Committee which devised the strategy. He
predicted that the US would exceed the goal it set a year ago to export
Dollars 1,000bn in goods and services annually by the year 2000.
Mr Robert Rubin, the president's economic adviser, said export promotion was
an integral part of the administration's economic policy, which calls for
increasing US productivity, opening markets through negotiation and helping
US companies to win sales.
Mr Brown said the administration had 'redefined the relationship between
business and government', making government an active partner in the efforts
of US companies to export. It had created a 17-agency Advocacy Co-ordinating
network 'to ensure co-operation across the government' and had established a
'war room' in the Commerce Department to track over 160 important foreign
projects. It had also launched high-level sales efforts by Mr Brown and
other administration officials, including the president.
More effective use had been made of export financing and much progress had
been achieved in eliminating unnecessary, ineffective export controls. Mr
Kenneth Brody, chairman of the US Export Import Bank, said the agency was
'no longer' passive in the face of strong competition from its foreign
rivals. He has created a new project finance division, which this year has
more than doubled the lending of 1993 to Dollars 360m. The division is now
pursuing a Dollars 3.5bn backlog of requests for finance of infrastructure
projects.
The bank's Tied Aid Capital Projects Fund is aggressively countering foreign
offers to eliminate the use of foreign tied aid. In an annual report,
submitted to Congress yesterday, the TPCC said that it would support the
Middle East peace process through expanded trade missions, private sector
initiatives and finance packages.

FT  06 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Eastern Europe 'failing to attract
investors' - FT Conferences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Progress in attracting private investment for infrastructure projects in
eastern Europe has been painfully slow, Mr Thierry Baudon, deputy
vice-president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said
yesterday.
Mr Baudon, speaking in London at a Financial Times conference on
international infrastructure finance, said the telecommunications industry
had made most progress in attracting private capital.
There had been very little private investment in roads, power or water
projects - other than a privately funded stretch of the M1/M15 motorway in
Hungary linking Budapest with Vienna.
Mr Baudon said the failure of eastern and central European governments to
develop adequate regulatory and tariff structures to cope with the
privatisation of vital services had made it very difficult to attract
commercial investors.
Private sector promoters needed to be reassured that they would be able to
levy sufficient charges on users to repay loans and earn adequate returns on
their investments.
The cost to the public of water and power had traditionally been very low in
these countries and it would be difficult to increase these charges.
Governments seeking to minimise costs would have to increase the proportion
of their own state investment in these projects.
Private sector investors would have to be satisfied that tariffs and
regulatory structures would not be changed in the future without adequate
compensation, he said.
Poland was most advanced in developing a regulatory framework to cope with
privatisation but much work still needed to be done to satisfy international
investors.
Overmanning was another problem, Mr Baudon said, adding that he had not come
across a single water treatment plant in eastern and central Europe which
did not have twice as many employees as needed.
Potential investors would also have to be confident that there would be
sufficient customers to pay for their services. This was proving difficult
in areas like energy generation, when demand for power was falling in many
of these countries.

FT  06 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Not so Super 301 after all - A once feared
and loathed US trade weapon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Super 301, the most feared weapon in the US trade expansion armoury, was
always a bit of a fraud.
It was written into the 1988 US Trade law at the behest of congressional
'trade hawks' who felt that barriers to US exports were not being adequately
addressed by multilateral rules.
The Super 301 provision required the US trade representative to make a list
of 'priority foreign countries' and their most protectionist trade
practices. The USTR was then expected to negotiate away the offending trade
practice while holding the threat of retaliation as a sword of Damocles over
the offending country.
As it turned out, that sword never dropped on any country's head and the
Super 301 provision expired in 1990.
A recent book on US trade laws, Reciprocity and Retaliation in US Trade
Policy, released by the Institute for International Economics, says Super
301 was viewed as 'an extension of US unilateralism in which the US set
itself up as judge, jury and executioner without regard for international
trade rules'.
Trade hawks saw it as a means of addressing those Japanese trade barriers
not subject to challenge in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It
was not enough that the executive branch had all the authority it needed to
retaliate against 'unfair trade practices' under Section 301 of the act.
They saw Super 301 as a bigger, more powerful weapon.
Mr Thomas Bayard, one of the IIE authors, says the difference between Super
301 and Section 301 was the attention the former generated. Both provisions
gave the USTR a year to negotiate away trade barriers but sanctions at the
end of the line were not mandatory.
Mrs Carla Hills, the former USTR, complained about the rigidity of Super 301
but used it reluctantly as 'a tool' to open markets. In 1989, the first year
of its existence, Taiwan and Korea rushed to the bargaining table to make
deals to avoid being put on the Super 301 list. Japan was named for its
trade barriers against supercomputers, satellites and wood products. To
avoid embarrassing Japan by have it as the only country on the list, Brazil
was added for its import licensing restrictions and India for its investment
and insurance regimes.
The result, according to Mr Bayard's book, would have been at most Dollars
1.6bn in increased annual exports, if the agreements had been fully
implemented. But they were not. The satellite deal appears to be working,
but the wood agreement awaits tariff cuts promised in the Uruguay Round and
the Japanese government appears to be dictating individual purchases of US
supercomputers.
India never agreed to talk under Super 301 and was never punished. Brazil
changed its trade policies because a new government brought in new policies.
In his campaign to become US president in 1992, Mr Bill Clinton promised to
resurrect Super 301. But once in office, his interagency trade policy team
devised a more sophisticated strategy under which the US-Japan economic
relationship would be organised.
All bilateral concerns would be brought under a broad negotiating
'framework' which combined the elements of previous sectoral negotiations
and the Bush Administration's initiative to root out Japan's 'structural
impediments' to trade. It would encompass macroeconomic measures to reduce
Japan's multilateral trade surplus and indicators by which to measure
success.
When Japan agreed to the new approach in June 1993, there seemed to be no
need for a Super 301. But two Japanese prime ministers later - at a summit
in Washington between prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Clinton
 -the two sides fell out.
It was then the administration rediscovered Super 301.
Whether by design or by chance, Mr Mickey Kantor, the current USTR has used
it skilfully to ratchet up the pressure on Japan for a deal under the
framework. With Congress threatening to renew Super 301, he headed off new
legislation by renewing the provision administratively, but in a milder
form: instead of listing erring countries he would list trade practices
which pose obstacles to trade. This was considered less insulting.
Instead of releasing a Super 301 list in April, Mr Kantor moved the deadline
to September 30. This gave Japan nearly seven months to resolve its
political problems and negotiate under the framework.
To add to the pressure on Japan, Congressman Richard Gephardt introduced new
and tougher market opening legislation. Mr Kantor warned Japan publically
that US-Japanese ties were 'in serious disrepair'.
When fear of trade war caused the dollar to tumble, and the yen to soar,
Japan was ready to resume the framework talks. This time, the pressure of
the newly designed Super 301 came into play, with September 30 as the
deadline for a framework deal.
September 30 also became the final deadline for agreement on procurement and
Mr Kantor warned that if no agreement was reached, the sanctions process
would begin immediately.
With all the pressure in play, five deals were reached at the weekend under
the framework. When the Super 301 list was released three days late on
Monday, the Clinton administration declined to list even 'priority' trade
practices, saying they were all being negotiated in other arenas.
The 'kinder, gentler' Super 301 will remain on the books - it is contained
in the implimenting legislation for the Uruguay Round - but nothing forces
an administration to use it.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Yugoslav economy in the balance: James Whittington assesses
the war legacy and the pressures as sanctions are eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There cannot be many places in the world where a central bank governor is
hailed as a national folk hero. But in Serbia and Montenegro, the two
remaining constituents of Yugoslavia, the septuagenarian governor of the
National Bank of Yugoslavia, Mr Dragoslav Abramovic, is viewed as the
nation's economic saviour.
A former employee of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Mr
Abramovic is credited with reversing the economic collapse of rump
Yugoslavia caused by international sanctions and the war in Bosnia. On
January 21 he introduced an economic stabilisation programme based on a new
currency, the super-dinar, which was pegged at parity with the D-Mark and
backed by hard currency and gold reserves.
The results, eight months on, have confounded his critics and exceeded all
expectations. Inflation was brought down from a dizzy 313m per cent in
January to -0.8 per cent in March. Last month it stood at 0.2 per cent,
according to the Belgrade Institute of Economic Sciences. Industrial
production is on the increase, wages are rising, and shops have been
surprisingly full in spite of an economic embargo imposed by the
international community 28 months ago as punishment for fuelling the war in
Bosnia.
The psychological effect of the affable governor who relentlessly seeks to
explain and convince the population of his programme has been immense. The
lifting of some sanctions yesterday in the fields of sports and culture, and
the re-opening of the international airport in Belgrade, will be a further
boost.
But cracks are appearing and there are signs that what the Serbian press has
dubbed 'the economic miracle' might be crumbling.
The re-appearance of black market money-changers trying to meet an
insatiable demand for D-Marks has signalled a weakening of the dinar. A
black market rate of 1.2 dinars to the D-Mark last week had risen to DM1.4
yesterday. One money-changer in Belgrade explained that the demand for
D-Marks comes from widespread smuggling and sanctions-busting operations.
'People need hard currency to trade outside and buy petrol and demand is
very high, especially from (Serb-held) Bosnia,' he says. 'Until now supply
simply met demand but as people are getting rich from smuggling they want
more.' As the black market premium widens, people are switching to D-Marks
for fear of a repeat of the hyper-inflation of last year.
Moreover, shop prices are showing inflationary pressures. In the past week
there have been shortages of milk, meat, and cooking oil as shopkeepers have
removed their stocks rather than raise their prices. And the price of
smuggled petrol is also rising.
Mr Jurij Bajec, from the Belgrade Economic Institute, believes that the
central bank must quickly intervene to defend the dinar while maintaining a
tight hold on monetary and fiscal expansion. He says that at the beginning
of the economic programme the money supply was increased slowly in tandem
with the growth in foreign exchange reserves, but by mid-year it began
moving ahead.
'The money supply has reached a critical point of YD2.1bn of which around 50
per cent is in cash, which is enormous. If it exceeds this then inflation
will return which will be beyond control,' he says.
Foreign exchange reserves, which are supposed to be a national secret, stand
at around DM500m, which leaves little room for manoeuvre.
Mr Abramovic dismisses these fears of inflation. 'There's no need to
question the fate of the dinar because nothing negative has happened so far
in the economy,' he says. He points out that average monthly wages have
risen from DM30 in January to DM200 in September.
Instead of maintaining tight fiscal and monetary policies he wants to expand
credit and increase investment to maintain the rise in output. This year
gross national product of about Dollars 10bn is forecast to grow by 8 per
cent, after contracting by 30 per cent in 1993. 'I don't believe in a credit
inflation,' he says. 'The private sector is flourishing and our enterprises
need more, not less, money.'
Where this is to come from is not clear. The domestic banks are in so much
trouble that they can only afford withdrawals of DM30 a month on even
healthy current accounts. The Belgrade stock market is all but defunct apart
from trade in short-term promissory notes. And the government has no access
to international capital markets or its foreign bank accounts because of
sanctions.
Most of the ifs and buts surrounding the economy come back to psychology. If
Mr Abramovic can continue to persuade the Serbs that they have never had it
so good under the sanctions, all will be well.
Until sanctions are lifted, however, the unnatural distortions in the
economy, including the miraculous fixed exchange rate, are likely to store
up problems.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Nato seeks tougher stance on air strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK and FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nato ambassadors, irritated by the caution of the UN commanders in Bosnia,
agreed yesterday to appeal above their heads to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali,
the UN secretary-general, for a tougher approach to policing the Bosnian
skies, write Bruce Clark and Frances Williams.
The ambassadors, meeting in Brussels, resolved to write to Mr Boutros Ghali
with a list of proposals for faster and more effective air strikes in
response to Bosnian Serb provocations. They will call on him to accept the
principle of air strikes without warning, and against multiple targets.
Under the new proposals, UN commanders would retain their ultimate veto over
air raids, but there would be an agreed set of procedures for responding
swiftly to provocations and a 'presumption' that they would be followed.
Diplomats said Canada was the only Nato country with reservations about
this.
Differences between the UN and Nato over air tactics in Bosnia were left
unbridged by a three-hour meeting on Monday between Mr William Perry, US
defence secretary, and senior UN officials in Croatia. Relations
deteriorated last weekend when a French Mirage was almost shot down by an
anti-aircraft missile over northern Bosnia. Nato proposed retaliating with
air raids but UN commanders vetoed this as it was impossible to tell who had
fired the missile.
In Geneva, Britain's Lord Owen called for an end to the bizarre forms of
cross-border trade which stoke the Yugoslav war. French officials alleged
recently that Croatian sources were supplying Serbia with oil in return for
weapons.

The discovery of three letter bombs in Austria this week has sharpened
tensions in the country over immigration only four days before a national
election. None of the packages, delivered to a Slovenian publisher in
Klagenfurt, a foreigners' advice centre and a paper factory in Tyrol,
exploded. Mr Franz Loschnak, the interior minister, said the bombs were
similar to those sent last December to prominent figures associated with
refugee and immigration issues. Mr Helmut Zilk, the mayor of Vienna, lost a
thumb and two fingers when one exploded in his hands. Mr Loschnak said
investigations of the latest letter bombs indicated neo-Nazis might be
responsible. 'From notes enclosed with the bombs it is clear that this
action is motivated by hatred of foreigners and that it is more likely to
come from right-wing extremists,' he told Austrian state television.

President Gaidar Aliyev, Azerbaijan's president, yesterday angrily accused
Russia of trying to destabilise the country after claiming he had
successfully crushed a revolt in Azerbaijan's second largest city, Gence.
President Aliyev, a former member of the politburo of the Soviet Union,
declared a state of emergency on Monday after unrest in the country.
Azerbaijan's prime minister, Mr Suret Huseinov, denied suggestions he had
been involved in the coup and declared his support for Mr Aliyev. Tensions
have risen between Russia and Azerbaijan following a dispute over oil rights
in the Caspian Sea. Russia refused to recognise a Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.4bn)
oil deal Azerbaijan concluded with a western consortium and a Russian
Foreign Ministry spokesman yesterday denied the allegations and said
Azerbaijan was trying to tamper with Soviet-Iranian border agreements.
'Russia considers this inadmissible and comes out against unilateral
attempts by Baku to spread its jurisdiction over certain sections of the
Caspian Sea,' the spokesman said.

Switzerland's gross domestic product is expected to rise 1.5 per cent in
1994 and growth is forecast to accelerate to 2.5 per cent in 1995, the Swiss
Federal Institute of Technology's centre for economic research said. The
centre forecast growth for 1996 of 2.7 per cent. The Swiss economy started
to recover in the third quarter of 1993, with demand for exports and private
consumption picking up appreciably. The report also forecast that consumer
prices, which rose an average of 3.3 per cent in 1993, will increase 0.9 per
cent in 1994, but jump to 2.7 per cent in 1995, because of the introduction
of a value-added tax on January 1. The report estimated that VAT would add
about 1.3 per cent to the consumer price index in 1995. On the unemployment
front, however, the report forecast only a gradual decline in the country's
jobless rate. It said unemployment, which will rise from 4.5 per cent to 4.7
per cent in 1994, will ease to 4.2 per cent in 1995.

More than 15,000 Albanians have been prevented from attempting to flee the
country aboard ships at the Adriatic port of Durres, the authorities said. A
police official in Durres said groups of young people had tried to make
their way to the port area of the town, about 30km west of Tirana, in what
looked like a repeat of an exodus in 1991 when thousands crammed on to ships
to flee to Italy. Police said special forces had blocked roads entering
Durres from the south and east, turning back about 15,000 Albanians in the
last three days. Those turned away mostly came from the towns of Elbasani,
Librazhdi, Fieri and Lushnja. Young people caught by police said they had
heard rumours the port would open and ferries would be leaving for Italy.
More than 20,000 Albanians tried to flee the country on ships in March and
August 1991, following the collapse of 40 years of hardline communist rule.
Most of them left on rusting ships moored in Durres for Bari and Brindisi in
Italy. Italian authorities sent most of them back.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's Socialist government has proposed legislation clearing the way for
the partial privatisation of OTE, the state telecoms monopoly, by the end of
the year. The government hopes to raise some Dr350bn (Pounds 917m) through
floating 25 per cent of the company on the Athens stock exchange. Some 7 per
cent will be offered to local investors, while the remaining 18 per cent is
to be sold to institutional investors abroad. The new law, expected to be
approved by parliament this month, restructures the company as a public
corporation and provides for sharp increases in domestic tariffs over the
next three years, aimed at boosting OTE's revenues by Dr100bn yearly. But
management will remain under government control, with six out of 11 board
members being appointed by the state. The law does not make any provision
for appointing an international telecom operator as a technical consultant.
Local analysts described the legislation as a compromise designed to appease
OTE's unions, which are opposed to the flotation. But they said the
appointment of a technical adviser was seen as crucial to the flotation's
success.

<TEXT>
France's ministers, MPs and leading local politicians should be submitted to
an annual audit of their personal financial assets, designed to screen them
for possible corruption, the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, said
yesterday. Bowing to increasing public and political pressure for action to
stem the rising tide of corruption allegations, Mr Balladur proposed that
the National Assembly set up a system by the end of this year whereby a
panel of senior magistrates would examine politicians' assets and refer any
'presumed irregularities' to prosecutors. Pressure on the Gaullist RPR prime
minister increased with this week's opening of a judicial investigation into
allegations that the Republican party, a coalition partner in the
government, has illegally received corporate funds in the past. A Communist
MP yesterday accused Mr Balladur of 'covering with his protecting wing three
members of the government', a reference to its trio of Republican ministers.
Of this trio, Mr Gerard Longuet, the trade and industry minister, is the
most likely to resign following the sort of allegations about personal
financial and real estate assets that Mr Balladur's audit plan is aimed at
meeting.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France is sharply increasing spending on military spy satellites next year
both as an example for its European partners to emulate and as a fall-back
if they do not.
France's planned 23.4 per cent increase in space expenditure to FFr5bn
(Pounds 600m) next year, chiefly on the Helios I and II reconnaissance
satellite programmes, is the most striking change of direction in the
government's 1995 draft defence budget detailed yesterday by Mr Francois
Leotard, the defence minister. Out of a proclaimed desire to free France and
Europe of dependence on US intelligence satellites as well as on military
transport aircraft, the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, last month
urged fellow Europeans to join France in developing 'a true European space
observation system', saying that he was counting particularly on German
support. Regardless of this project, however, Mr Balladur forecast France
would spend enough on the Helios programme, carried out in co-operation with
Italy and Spain, to give it a spy satellite system of its own. Mr Leotard
said yesterday this would come as early as next spring with the launch of
the first Helios I satellite. The minister claimed that France and Greece
were the only Nato countries raising their defence spending. In fact, the
1.5 per cent nominal increase in overall French military spending to
FFr202.3bn next year is less than expected inflation of 1.7 per cent. But
expenditure on equipment is to rise by 2 per cent to FFr102.4bn,
constituting the slight increase in real terms to which the Balladur
government is committed.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Rock's leader questions British motives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Joe Bossano, the pugnacious chief minister of the British crown colony of
Gibraltar, believes that London, either by neglect or through fear of
upsetting the Madrid government, is undermining his attempts to achieve
self-sufficiency for the Rock by transforming it into an offshore finance
centre.
In an interview with the Financial Times, the Gibraltar Socialist Labour
party leader, who in 1992 was overwhelmingly re-elected to power by the
colony's 31,000 inhabitants, said the UK was failing in its duty responsibly
to handle the colony's external affairs. He also accused the UK Foreign
Office of 'bad faith' for suggesting that he had been reprimanded by the
foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, at a meeting in London last month.
'I think (the UK) is hampering us. It could be a long-term strategy to make
Gibraltar look to Spain for its future,' Mr Bossano said. 'There is no
absolute proof of this but the circumstantial evidence makes it difficult to
believe that there could be such a level of incompetence over the decisions
that are concerning us.'
Mr Bossano's tough talk is in character with his single-minded promotion of
self-determination for the Gibraltarians - an option that has been ruled out
by the UK as well as by Spain, which demands Gibraltar's decolonisation and
its return.
His bluntness could also complicate bilateral talks between Spain and the UK
that were set up in 1987 to discuss the future of Gibraltar. Spanish
diplomats believe that Britain is failing to exert 'effective tutelage' over
Gibraltar. 'We are coming round to thinking that London cannot deliver
anything on Gibraltar,' said one diplomat who questioned the usefulness of
the negotiations. Spain is viewed as holding the key to Gibraltar's ability
to emerge from a damaging recession but Mr Bossano says that relations with
Madrid are 'in a cul-de-sac'.
However, reversing his previous total opposition to talks with Spain, Mr
Bossano said: 'I am prepared to negotiate directly with Spain, although
constitutionally I cannot do it unless I have London's sanction.'
In August tensions with Britain came to a head when the colony's
attorney-general, who is appointed by London and advises the Gibraltar
government, resigned 11 months before completing his three-year term in
office, citing differences of opinion between himself and the colony's
governor.
The UK, which answers for Gibraltar in the European Union, is understood to
be concerned about the implementation of Brussels directives on the Rock,
particularly those concerning the finance sector, and it is increasingly
worried over Madrid's complaints that the colony, at the southern tip of
Spain, has added drug smuggling to its traditional tobacco smuggling
activities.
The chief minister centres his criticism on the UK's insistence on stepping
up its regulatory powers over Gibraltar's financial sector and thereby, in
his view, effectively preventing the colony from developing tax efficient
services for the EU, similar to those in Luxembourg.
He wants Gibraltar, for example, to set its own rules on the independent
auditing of the 35,000 companies registered on the Rock in order to maintain
the secrecy of asset-holding companies owned by individuals. Should London
insist on comprehensive auditing, he said, 'I might finish up with no
companies to audit because they will have all gone somewhere else in the
Union, to our competition such as Luxembourg'.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Job figures give election boost to Kohl: Good news on
employment enhanced by report of steady producer prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Helmut Kohl's hopes of a fourth term as German chancellor were given a
timely fillip yesterday by improving unemployment figures and a favourable
opinion poll.
The last labour market data to be issued before the federal election on
October 16 show that the seasonally adjusted jobless total in the west fell
by 5,000 last month. Although slight, and enhanced by a rise in numbers
taking part in official work creation and education schemes, the improvement
exceeded most expectations.
Coupled with an unadjusted drop of 64,000 in the east, the result was likely
to be 'highly supportive' for Mr Kohl, according to one analyst.
The optimistic message was reinforced by pan-German producer prices
unchanged in July from June, and up only 0.3 per cent year-on-year.
The unadjusted jobless figure for the whole country fell more than 140,000,
taking the total below 3.5m for the first time this year. Mr Bernhard
Jagoda, president of the federal labour office, said the data were more
favourable than usual at this time of year, when companies hired extra staff
after the summer lull.
Vacancies registered in the west rose 16 per cent during the month, Mr
Jagoda remarked, adding that the low point in the eastern labour market was
'well behind us'.
At 7.9 per cent compared with 8.2 per cent in August, the jobless rate in
the west was the lowest of the year so far, although still above the annual
average of 7.4 per cent in 1993. The eastern rate, down to 13.8 per cent in
September from 14.7 per cent, was also considered likely to bolster support
for Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) in the region.
Signs of improved backing for the CDU in the five new states emerged
yesterday in a poll from the Allensbach Institute showing nationwide support
for the ruling coalition steady at 49.3 per cent.
Although the share of the vote going to the liberal Free Democrats, junior
government partners, was down slightly on the institute's previous survey,
it was still sufficient at 8.2 per cent to help the current coalition to an
absolute parliamentary majority.
Meanwhile, the Social Democrats advanced their share to 35.1 per cent from
34.7 per cent in the previous Allensbach count, while the Greens, their
putative coalition partners, slipped from 9.2 per cent to 8 per cent. The
Party of Democratic Socialism, the successor to the east German communists,
has continued to gain ground, scoring 4.5 per cent compared with 3.6 per
cent in the previous poll.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Biondi turns the tables on his tormentors: Minister's
resignation offer could rebound on investigating magistrates who have
criticised him
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The on-off resignation yesterday of Mr Alfredo Biondi, Italy's justice
minister, looks like the mirror-image of the events of July.
Then, it was Italy's most famous anti-corruption magistrates - Milan's Mani
Pulite (clean hands) team - who offered their resignation after Mr Biondi
tabled a decree banning the use of preventive detention in bribery and
corruption investigations. The public outcry forced the government into a
humiliating reversal of its policy, and the magistrates returned to their
posts.
Mr Biondi's resignation - offered in the morning, refused by the cabinet,
and then withdrawn in the afternoon - was in protest at comments by Mr
Francesco Saverio Borrelli, the Milan prosecutor who is in charge of the
Mani Pulite team.
But in spite of its similarities, it may have more serious implications for
Italy than the July saga of the magistrates' resignation.
It comes at the end of a torrid four weeks in which the magistrates, in
particular Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the best-known member of the Milan team,
have been accused of wanting to enter the political arena, a possibility
which has made even opponents of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government uneasy.
In the interview, the daily Corriere della Sera quotes Mr Borrelli as saying
that the magistrates have reached 'a crucial moment' in their
investigations.
In particular, he warns of the risk that their inquiry into alleged
corruption at Telepiu, the pay-television channel founded by Mr Berlusconi
and since sold to other investors, 'could also reach extremely high
financial and political levels'.
In the interview, Mr Borrelli, who refused to comment yesterday on the
repercussions, went on to attack Mr Biondi, not only for his conduct as a
minister but also in his previous job as a top defence lawyer.
Mr Biondi could not simply sack Mr Borrelli for his remarks, because only
the magistrature's governing body, which is now relatively independent of
political control, can dismiss magistrates.
However, the minister's offer to resign is an indication that Mr Borrelli,
who is normally a shrewd player of media and public opinion, may have
finally overstepped the mark.
On Tuesday, Mr Berlusconi, whose Fininvest business empire is currently the
object of seven different legal investigations, accused the magistrates of
distorting justice for political ends.
But this is an opinion now shared by a growing number of observers outside
the government. This could turn into a backlash against the magistrates, who
until now have had almost a free hand to investigate widespread corruption.
The Milan magistrates lent fuel to the accusation of dabbling in politics in
September, when they outlined legislative proposals for clearing up the
long-running corruption investigation.
Mr Di Pietro himself has not helped matters by publishing a book on the
Italian constitution, with a foreword by the wily former Italian president
Mr Francesco Cossiga, who said the work marked Mr Di Pietro's 'entry into
politics' and signalled 'an exit route from the crisis for the country'.
At the weekend Mr Rocco Buttiglione, leader of the opposition Popular party,
the former Christian Democrats, warned that corruption accusations might be
levelled at Mr Berlusconi, allowing Mr Di Pietro to become prime minister as
the candidate of the extreme right coalition party, the National Alliance.
Meanwhile, lawyers for Mr Sergio Cusani - the financier prosecuted by Mr Di
Pietro and jailed for corruption earlier this year - have lodged a complaint
against the magistrate, accusing him of slander and abuse of office during
the trial.
Mr Di Pietro has vowed not to make any more public statements until after
the latest corruption trial, in which he is again prosecuting. Yesterday, in
a courtroom exchange with one witness, he said he had no intention of taking
part in political campaigns.
That approach may prove the most fruitful for the magistrates, who are only
now reaching the core of their latest investigation into the alleged bribery
of anti-fraud police by big Italian companies. If the government decides to
use this latest excuse to rein in the magistrates' powers, then the latest
phase of cleaning up Italy's political and business regime could be stalled.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Kremlin impotent over large-scale managerial fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government yesterday heard a detailed report on systematic theft
of property by Russia's top managers - in the face of which senior ministers
confessed their impotence. This 'managerial looting' - now running at tens
of trillions of roubles - is allegedly hugely increasing the load of debt
owed to private and government enterprises.
Mr Sergei Belayev, the director of the Federal Bankruptcy Agency, told the
committee on inter-enterprise debt chaired by Mr Oleg Soskovets, the first
deputy prime minister, that corrupt contracts had meant the delivery of
materials for which no money was officially paid for months or even years -
though it could be assumed that money changed hands unofficially. Meanwhile,
the cost of the products appeared on the company books as debt, and the
managers appealed to the government for subsidies and delayed paying their
workers wages.
Mr Belayev, whose agency investigates the ability of Russian enterprises to
pay their bills and who has compiled a dossier on the activities of Russia's
companies, said 'this is typical of much of Russian industry and is doing
large-scale damage to the Russian economy. They (the managers) are exporting
the working capital of the country.'
Mr Soskovets said he would recommend a presidential decree controlling the
actions of enterprise managers and establishing permanent financial control
over the larger debtors. However, Mr Gennady Melikyan, labour minister, said
the managers most at fault 'are probably too smart to be caught' and that
'it is clear they are getting fat on this, but what can we do?'
Mr Belayev used the instance of the Norsi oil refinery in Nizhny Novgorod as
an example of management actions. The refinery had been declared unable to
pay its debts of more than Rbs1,000bn, but in fact, said Mr Belayev, it had
substantial assets and earning power.
In association with the 'Roman Invest' trading company in St Petersburg, the
refinery had shipped a significant part of its output without any payment at
all for a year. Inflation had reduced the value of the money eventually
received. In the course of 1993, the value of products involved was Rbs12bn.
When officials from Rosneft, the Russian oil holding company, attempted to
collect its 38 per cent of shares in Norsi in order to exercise control over
its operations, they were barred from entering the plant. Ministers at the
meeting said that Rosneft's acquiescence in this prohibition represented a
'complete abdication or responsibility'.
Mr Vladimir Gusev, head of the state taxation service, said 'everyone has
known about this for a long time'.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Brussels aims to reduce set-aside land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The amount of land European Union farmers are obliged to take out of
production would be reduced from 15 to 13 per cent, under a proposal
approved yesterday by the European Commission.
The decision has to be ratified by member states, but the big farm lobby,
with France as its champion, had been pushing for at least such a reduction
in fallow land.
The decision will be welcomed by farmers across the Union, who regard the
obligation to 'set aside' land as iniquitous, and whose organisations had
forecast that up to a third of European farmland would be left idle.
The move is confirmation that the 1992 reform of the Common Agricultural
Policy is biting. That reform was meant to cut subsidised overproduction
through price reductions of up to 30 per cent over three years, and
mandatory 'set-aside' of land. The reform envisaged that the amount of land
to be laid fallow would go up or down, depending on whether output was near
target.
The 1994-95 marketing year, the second year of the reform, has seen EU
cereals output drop significantly to around 162m tonnes, an increase in
set-aside from 4.5m hectares to 5.9m hectares, and a drop in grain
stockpiles from 33m to 14m tonnes.
'The combination of CAP reform and a strong world market has resulted in
cereals' prices being higher than those foreseen or desired,' said Mr Rene
Steichen, EU farm commissioner.
Reflecting the sensitivity of the issue, he added: 'It would be totally
unacceptable to producers if EU policymakers were to insist on a level of
set-aside beyond that which is strictly necessary.'
A combination of reform and drought has led to grain shortages in the
European Union market and a strong world market price. Thus, the CAP is well
in line with the reform's planned output cuts, but perilously above forecast
price levels.
The latter has important implications for the EU's ability to meet
commitments to cut subsidised exports under the Uruguay Round world trade
agreement, due to come into force in the farm sector next summer.
With EU grain prices now about 25 per cent above world levels, the Union is
still paying out the export subsidies which the Uruguay Round will gradually
cut back. But the set-aside reduction would boost grains output by about 4m
tonnes, weakening prices and the cost of inputs for livestock and poultry.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Yeltsin faces two-pronged attack: Zhirinovsky's praise for
North Korea a snub to Russian parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic
party which won a large following in the Russian parliament in the last
elections, has said North Korea has 'a distinguished leader, an excellent
society and a great history . . . its excellent style of politics has
brought it great success', according to the official Korean news agency.
Mr Zhirinovsky's visit to North Korea, now shunned by Russian leaders,
coincides with the opening of the Russian parliament, and symbolises the
nationalist leader's contempt both for the democratic process in Russia and
for parliament itself.
His party has threatened to walk out of the parliament, and to back -
although not initiate - a vote of no-confidence in the Russian leadership.
His star has waned as well as waxed since his success last December in the
parliamentary polls. But he has remained able to command attention, and is
now supporting the candidacy of Mr Sergei Mavrodi, controversial (and
jailed) head of the MMM share dealing company, as a candidate for the
constituency of Mytishi, an industrial suburb of Moscow.
The previous deputy was killed there, in what was described as a gangland
feud.
The opening of the parliament was also marked by a direct accusation by Mr
Victor Ilyukhin, the communist deputy who chairs the state duma's security
committee, that Mr Boris Yeltsin 'has been suffering from alcoholism for a
long time and cannot run the country.'
He said it was 'our anguish' and 'the peak of shame for Russia' to watch the
Russian president's recent conduct abroad. Mr Ilyukhin was referring to Mr
Yeltsin's public indisposition during a visit to Germany last month, and his
inability to descend from his aircraft to meet Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish
Prime Minister, while en route back from the US last week. Mr Oleg
Soskovets, the first deputy premier who met Mr Reynolds, said the Russian
president was ill - while Mr Yeltsin later said he had overslept. 'The
security service did not let in the people to wake me. Of course, I will
sort things out and punish them,' he said then.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian far eastern region of Primorye and its capital of Vladivostok,
potentially among the richest areas of the country, are now under the
control of a 'criminal clique' who defy federal laws, suppress both
opposition and independent media and have enriched themselves corruptly.
These claims are made in a report by Russia's main liberal party, Russia's
Choice.
The report by a group of experts caused the country's four main liberal
parties - Russia's Choice, Yabloko, Party for Russian Unity and Accord and
the Liberal Democratic Union - to appeal to President Boris Yeltsin to delay
the gubernatorial elections in the region, scheduled for tomorrow.
They said that Mr Yevgeny Nazdratenko, the present governor, had rigged the
elections for his victory and that any voting would be farcical.
Mr Yeltsin issued a decree last week banning all gubernatorial elections
throughout the country - a move aimed, according to his own staff, at
stopping Mr Nazdratenko.
The Primoye governor at first said he would defy the decree, arguing that
elections had been called before the decree had been promulgated, and then
yesterday backed down and agreed to postpone tomorrow's vote.
The report, a copy of which has been obtained by the Financial Times, is a
catalogue of corruption, rule by fear and flagrant abuse of the law - though
much of the testimony is given by the governor's political opponents and he
has refused to comment on it.
The authors of the report say that Mr Nazdratenko has:
dismissed, harassed and even imprisoned many of his opponents;
closed down most independent press and the independent television station;
created a company with a group of business leaders, which in turn own
substantial stakes in more than 200 privatised enterprises in Primorye
region;
ignored the Russian constitution, federal laws and direct instructions from
the government - including one to re-open the television station.
The report says that 'most of all, we were struck by a general atmosphere of
fear, recalling the bygone days of our totalitarian past'. It quotes the
judgment of one of the last remaining independent papers that the senior
administrators are 'running the region while increasingly strengthening a
lawless, violent, corrupt and unpunished regime, with the toleration and the
silence of Moscow'.
Among those prepared to speak to the Russia's Choice experts who wrote the
report were Mr V Butov, former presidential representative in Primorye. He
alleges that he was sacked from his post when he tried to bring the
corruption and the violence in the region to the attention of the Russian
administration.
Mr V Cherepkov, a former mayor of Vladivostok, said he was beaten up by
local security forces and dismissed by Mr Nazdratenko on falsified bribery
charges.
Mr Ivan Ustinov, a member of the state duma (lower house) for the region,
told the experts that a 'huge campaign of discrimination and discrediting'
had been mounted against him by Mr Nazdratenko - including a false
accusation of building seven dachas for rent outside Moscow with state money
and the publication of false testimony of his illegal activities as head of
the Nakhodka Free Economic Zone.
Mr T Romanenko, leader of the Russia's Choice organisation in the region,
said the governor obliquely threatened his daughter after he had published
articles critical of him.
The charges and counter-charges in part reflect the particularly chaotic
nature of growth in Vladivostok and the surrounding areas - where Moscow's
laws are far away and where trade, criminality and self-enrichment have
grown steeply in the past two years.
Journalists appear to have been particularly badly affected. According to
the report, 12 have petitioned for exit visas to the US, claiming the status
of political refugees.

Britain blocked EU efforts to agree a strategy to curb carbon dioxide
emissions and boost the efficient use of energy, Mr Klaus Topfer, German
environment minister, said after a meeting of the Union environment
ministers which ended early yesterday, Reuter reports from Luxembourg.
Mr Topfer told a news conference he had hoped to combine several existing
policies on energy use and CO fossil fuel emissions. 'We couldn't agree
because of the specific position of Great Britain. No doubt about that.'
His plan foundered on objections by Mr John Gummer, the UK minister, to the
term 'Community taxation measures' in a strategy document, a reference to a
suggested EU-level CO or energy tax. Britain has previously opposed any move
to increase EU-level involvement in tax matters.

FT  06 OCT 94 / EU's car dealership networks to remain
</HEADLINE>

The European Commission is set to allow Europe's car manufacturers and
dealers to keep their privileged system of exclusive car dealer networks,
with some modifications, for another 10 years.
Yesterday's long-awaited Commission draft document setting out the
industry's further exemption from normal EU competition rules was greeted
with cautious relief by carmakers and dealers but consumer groups reacted
angrily.
The Commission claimed that proposed changes to the terms of the exemption
would make it easier for consumers to seek the best deals in any EU country,
and would increase competition in car sales and servicing. But consumer
groups claimed that they would 'do nothing' for buyers.
The changes include a provision for dealers to be allowed to sell more than
one make of car - but only from separate sites under separate management;
for dealers to be allowed to buy spare parts from makers other than the car
manufacturers and to advertise outside the territory allocated to them; for
independent repairers to have access to manufacturers' technical
information; and measures to remove obstacles to cross-border trading.
However, manufacturers will still be able to choose which dealers they
supply, and the dealers will retain exclusive franchises within clearly
defined sales territories for 10 more years after the industry's current
'block exemption' from EU competition rules expires on June 1.
The document was described by the Commission as the best way of serving
consumer interests through safeguarding standards of sales and servicing for
a complex product with important safety considerations.
Ms Valerie Thompson, head of communications at BEUC, the European Consumers'
Organisation, said: 'They are small steps but they have not gone far enough
. . . the main consumer benefit of going to one showroom and being able to
compare rival makes of car, quality and prices would not be allowed.'
Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, chief operating officer of Fiat, the Italian carmaker,
and president of ACEA, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association,
expressed concern that some of the proposals 'would represent a significant
additional cost burden and would lead to greater undue complexity' for
makers and dealers. The carmakers are unhappy that, despite the restrictions
on sites and managements, the proposed rules open the door to the creation
of multi-franchise dealer groups.
Mr Robert Blower of the UK's multi-franchise Cowie Group welcomed the
document as a significant shift in the balance of power towards dealers away
from manufacturers.
'The ability to advertise outside territories, use independent suppliers'
parts and multi-franchise gives us most of the things dealers have been
looking for from the review,' he said.
Plan will loosen carmakers' grip on dealers, Page 4

FT  06 OCT 94 / World News in Brief: Cult link seen as 48 people die in
Swiss villages
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Forty-eight people, believed to be members of a cult which originated in
Canada, died in a suspected collective suicide in Switzerland. Police found
the bodies in a barn basement at Cheiry, near Fribourg, and in three
burned-out ski chalets at Granges-sur-Salvan, 160km away. It is believed the
fires may have been triggered automatically. The cult, known in Canada as
the Order of the Solar Temple, is headed by Luc Jouret (above), a
46-year-old homeopathic doctor, whose whereabouts were not known yesterday.
In Quebec police said they believed the deaths in Switzerland were linked to
an arson fire that killed two people in a house next to one owned by Jouret
north of Montreal.

FT  06 OCT 94 / World markets fall on fears of further rate increase in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
World equity and bond markets fell again yesterday in the wake of new
figures showing robust US economic growth. The data heightened fears of an
imminent increase in US interest rates.
News of higher-than-expected orders for US manufactured goods in August
caused a sharp sell-off in the US Treasury bond market. The 30-year bond
fell by nearly a point, driving the yield up to 7.96 per cent in early
afternoon trading, close to the psychologically important 8 per cent level.
The benchmark bond later climbed off its lows.
The weakness of the Treasury market had a negative effect on share prices.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had fallen 45 points on Tuesday,
dropped a further 50 by early afternoon, triggering trading restrictions on
the New York Stock Exchange. The Dow ended just 13 points down, but
declining issues outnumbered advances by a 19-to-three margin.
Analysts said the markets feared that the Federal Reserve would raise rates
in response to a series of recent economic indicators, possibly after
Friday's employment figures. But some bond investors also worry that the Fed
is acting too tardily to slow US expansion, making inflation rise sharply.
Equity investors are concerned that corporate earnings are being squeezed by
rising raw material prices which they cannot pass on to customers, say
analysts. With shares looking quite expensive relative to bonds in historic
terms, any bond market weakness has prompted shares to fall.
European stock markets fell in the wake of the US market weak ness, with the
German and French markets closing at new 1994 lows.
In after-hours trading, the Dax index in Frankfurt was down 2.1 per cent on
the day, while in Paris, the CAC-40 index fell 2.3 per cent. In London, the
FT-SE 100 index closed 45.5 points down, or 1.5 per cent, at 2956.3, to
stand at its lowest level since early July.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Reed Elsevier to become biggest law publisher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing group, is poised to become the
world's largest publisher of legal information after its Dollars 1.5bn
acquisition of Mead Data Central, the electronic information arm of Mead
Corporation, the US paper and forest products group.
The dominant factor in what is a significant expansion in North America will
be the integration of Lexis and Nexis, Mead Data Central's online legal and
business services, with the group's existing electronic publishing
operations.
'This acquisition is a perfect strategic fit for us,' said Mr Pierre Vinken,
co-chairman, yesterday. 'It establishes for Reed Elsevier a leading position
in the growing US legal publishing and information markets.'
Mead had been seeking to divest MDC since May this year. It finally accepted
the Reed Elsevier offer on Tuesday, frustrating rival bids from Times
Mirror, the US media group, and Canadian publisher Thomson.
Mr Nigel Stapleton, Reed Elsevier's finance director, predicted that the
deal - financed from cash reserves and Dollars 1bn of dollar borrowings -
would be earnings enhancing 'from the outset' and would lift North American
sales by more than 50 per cent.
Growing demand for MDC's operations is expected to lift turnover to Dollars
612m next year, compared with Dollars 551m this year, and analysts expected
it to contribute profits of about Dollars 75m.
Shares in the group, however, fell in London and Amsterdam after Standard &amp;
Poor's placed Reed Elsevier ratings on its negative 'Credit Watch' list.
Reed International, the UK publisher which merged with the Dutch group last
year, ended down 11p at 744p, while Elsevier shed 59 cents to close at
Fl16.10.
Some city analysts blamed the negative reaction on concern at the group's
Pounds 1.2bn borrowings.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Blair offers olive branch to Social Democrat defectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair offered an olive branch yesterday to Social Democrat defectors
from Labour as it became clear at the party's conference in Blackpool that
his drive to drop Clause 4 socialism had wide support among delegates.
Amid increasing optimism among party modernisers that opposition to his
constitutional reforms will be short-lived, Mr Blair promised to 'welcome
back' members who defected to the breakaway Social Democratic party during
during Labour's left-right battles in the 1980s.
'Of course I welcome back those people who left the Labour party in the
early eighties for reasons that were understandable at that time. The Labour
party went through a bad period then,' he said.
The party's national executive committee last night rejected leftwing calls
for a special constitutional conference to debate the proposed changes,
which would water down Labour's historic commitment to public ownership.
But opponents will have an early chance to embarrass Mr Blair today in a
debate on a resolution tabled by Glasgow members offering solid support for
Clause 4.
The resolution, which was tabled before Mr Blair's dramatic announcement on
Clause 4 on Tuesday, will be backed by some of the big unions, including the
TGWU general union.
The NEC will urge delegates to shelve the resolution, which some see as
little more than a chance for delegates to let off steam. However,
supporters said the result could be close.
Admitting the potential dangers of the reform programme, Mr Blair told the
NEC that his promise to rewrite Clause 4 was 'a bold gamble that paid off'.
Mr Blair, who decided to include the pledge shortly before the speech,
attempted to minimise unease by promising widespread consultation on the
wording of constitutional changes.
The consultation will be led by Mr John Prescott, deputy leader, who will
insist that Labour cannot rule out public ownership in any form.
However, the wording of the revised statement of objectives is likely to lay
greater stress on the party's commitment to community involvement in high
quality public services.
'It's not about dumping or ditching. It's about being clear and precise and
offering a radical but sensible vision of the future,' Mr Blair said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand's gross domestic product grew by 6.1 per cent in the year to
June 30, one of the highest growth rates ever recorded, the prime minister,
Mr Jim Bolger, said yesterday.
He said the growth was due to sound responsible management, solid export
growth and increased investment. 'It has been achieved without any
artificial stimulation to the economy.'
However, the GDP figure has aroused concerns that the economy may be
overheating.
Interest rates rose sharply after the governor of the Reserve Bank, Dr Don
Brash, told a parliamentary committee yesterday that the figure was much
higher than expected and showed the economy was suffering from strong
inflationary pressures.
Financial markets believe that Dr Brash, who is in charge of monetary
policy, will shortly act to raise interest rates.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Manila Dollars 675m first-half surplus: Increase of 54% over
year ago

The Philippines' overall balance-of-payments ended the first half of this
year with a surplus of Dollars 675m, an increase of 54 per cent over a year
ago, data released by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the country's central
monetary authority, shows.
The favourable balance resulted mainly from a big increase in foreign
investment inflows (up 82 per cent to Dollars 2.59bn) and a sharp fall in
net short-term capital outflows (down 68 per cent to Dollars 165m).
This helped offset a rise in the merchandise trade deficit (up 42 per cent
to Dollars 4.06bn), the central bank data said.
The current account ended the six months with a deficit of Dollars 1.62bn,
higher by 38 per cent from the year before, because of the increased trade
shortfall.
Merchandise exports came to Dollars 6.07bn (Dollars 5.18bn the year before)
while imports reached Dollars 10.14bn (Dollars 8.05bn). Non-merchandise
receipts amounted to Dollars 524m while payments totalled Dollars 57m. The
increased flow of foreign investments combined with a net inflow of medium-
and long-term loans of Dollars 674m to boost the non-monetary capital
account to Dollars 2.1bn, the central bank said.
Philippine economic officials believe the big growth in imports, which has
led to the record trade deficits, has been brought about by acquisitions of
electric-power equipment and manufacturing machinery.
Finance officials said the gap may be expected to narrow with the end to the
power supply shortage in the country recently.

Agency said yesterday, AP reports from Manila.
New People's Army rebels ambushed their comrades in Siay, Zamboanga del Sur
Province, 490 miles south of Manila. The government has initiated an
amnesty, and pledged livelihood for those surrendering.

FT  05 OCT 94 / UN maritime agency panel to review safety: A look at action
prompted by the Baltic ferry disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International moves to strengthen safety controls on roll-on roll-off
ferries gathered pace yesterday with the announcement by the International
Maritime Organisation of plans to establish a panel of safety experts to
recommend action.
The efforts by the IMO, an arm of the United Nations, follow the sinking in
the Baltic last Wednesday of the car ferry Estonia with the loss of more
than 900 lives.
The proposal by IMO's secretary general, Mr William O'Neil, is unprecedented
in the organisation's 35-year history and is intended to shorten its
frequently lengthy procedures. Even so, a final decision to go ahead with
the panel will not be taken until its safety committee meets in two months.
At the same time, the UK department of transport's marine safety agency said
it would ask its surveyors to carry out immediate checks on the bow doors of
all ro-ro passenger ferries operating out of UK ports. Mr Robin Bradley,
chief executive of the agency, described this move as 'precautionary' but
added: 'In the light of the evidence emerging from the Estonia, I believe it
is important we should take this additional safety measure.'
Checks of vessels' inner and outer bow doors will be carried out within the
next 28 days. Inspectors will also examine closing procedures, surveillance
equipment and indicators.
P&amp;O European Ferries, which operates 45 ferries, said it hoped these moves
would put an end to speculation and start to establish some facts about
ferry safety.
The IMO expert panel will be headed by Mr Giuliano Pattofatto, an Italian
naval architect and chairman of the organisation's safety committee. It will
consist of representatives of member governments and outside experts. It is
expected to begin its work after the next meeting of the IMO's safety
committee between December 5 and 9 and present its recommendations to the
next meeting of that committee in May 1995.
'The idea is to speed up the process of review instead of deferring it to a
sub-committee meeting in three months time,' Mr Roger Kohn, the IMO
spokesman said.
'Nothing will be excluded. You have got to prove to the travelling public
that you are looking at everything seriously and give reassurance.'
Like other IMO committees the expert panel will only be able to make
recommendations. But only a small number of countries operate ro-ro ferries
and since they will be represented on the panel they can be expected to
carry out its suggestions, Mr Kohn said. Most ro-ro ferries are in use in
Europe, Japan and Australasia.
The IMO has been criticised in the past by some of its more safety-conscious
member governments for the slow pace of its deliberations. The UK clashed
with other members over plans for a tightening up of ferry regulations in
the wake of the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in 1987 and last
year warned that countries would take unilateral action if the IMO did not
move more quickly.
IMO officials point out, however, that the 149-member organisation has to
work by achieving consensus. 'For some of our members the pace is unbearably
quick, for others we are very slow,' Mr Fernando Plaza, a senior safety
director said recently.
The IMO has created 30 conventions, which are mandatory on member
governments, as well as more than 700 codes, which are advisory, on a wide
range of maritime safety issues. But it depends on governments to ratify and
enforce its regulations.
In its early days amendments to conventions required ratification by
two-thirds of member governments before they took effect.
Many proposals took years to implement, so in the early 1970s this was
changed to make amendments effective unless one-third of members rejected
them.
At present member governments are given two years or more to consider
amendments but this is shortly to be reduced to 18 months.
The IMO is constrained by the need to balance the interests of developing
countries, where economic development often takes precedence over safety
considerations, and those of western nations where the public demands higher
safety standards.
'We produce the highest practicable standards, not the highest possible
ones,' said Mr Plaza.
The transport committee of the European parliament is to discuss ferry
safety when it meets next Monday.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Finns order ro-ro bow doors welded shut

<TEXT>
Finland's board of navigation said yesterday that the bow doors of all
roll-on, roll-off ferries sailing in 'open' Baltic seas had to be welded
shut as a safety precaution while investigations into the sinking of the
Estonia continued. Swedish authorities say they will insist on similar
measures, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm.
Silja Line, the Baltic's leading ferry operator, said it would seal the bow
doors of five ferries - vessels which either sail in open seas or have the
same visor-type bow construction as the Estonia.
Three other Baltic ferry operators have promised similar measures.
Accident investigators want to locate the Estonia's bow door, after video
footage established on Monday that it had been torn off in heavy seas. Mr
Andi Meister, Estonian chairman of the commission, said: 'We now know how it
happened when water gushed into the ship, but we still do not know what
caused the catastrophe.'
Lines of inquiry include technical failure, metal fatigue, overloading and
negligence.
Meanwhile, the Stena Saga was withdrawn from service between Fredrikshavn in
Denmark and Oslo yesterday after Swedish inspectors discovered cracks in the
vessel's bow shield.
Estline, the operator of the Estonia, suffered another misfortune on Monday
evening when a chartered cargo ferry, the Cap Canaille, ran aground in the
Stockholm archipelago en route to the Estonian capital of Tallinn.
After freeing herself, she returned to Stockholm where a leak in a tank was
discovered.
She is expected to be out of service for several days.

An intense earthquake killed two people and injured more than 190 when it
erupted under the sea off Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido, sending
potentially devastating tidal waves rushing towards the coast. The quake was
measured at 8.2 on the Richter scale by the US Geological Survey and at 7.9
by Japan's main earthquake centre. Japan's national television network NHK
reported 196 people injured on Hokkaido's east coast. Many isolated areas,
particularly small islands close to the epicentre, were cut off from

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (28): Pressures will rise - Guest column / A
look at the competitive challenges facing the European credit insurance
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HARRY GROEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's credit insurers face unprecedented changes in their business over
the next few years: the industry is continuing to consolidate; former
national champions now have to face competition in their home markets; in
turn they are attempting to enter foreign markets.
The bigger companies are investing large sums in technology to turn their
vast stores of data into immediately accessible information. This brings the
advantage of greater speed for their customers, and better risk management
and accurate pricing for the insurers.
Competitive pressures will also increase, not abate, and the process of
consolidation will continue, until Europe has only a relatively small number
of large international credit insurers.
These groups will have to develop their existing skills to cope with the new
competitive pressures; they will also have to invest unprecedented amounts
in data manipulation, in information technology and in human resources. For
credit insurance, the challenge is not so much re-engineering as
re-schooling. The core curriculum will be the three Rs: recession,
regulation and reinsurance.
Recession has always been a factor in credit insurance, which is in itself a
cyclical business. When the economy grows, payments are made easily and
credit insurance - too often regarded as a palliative against fear rather
than a tool of financial risk management - is ignored. As recession hits,
customers default and bad debts mount.
Even more dangerously, after the recession has touched bottom, companies are
tempted to over-trade as recovery appears, often with disastrous results.
Despite these difficulties, however, the pattern used to be fairly
straightforward for a domestic credit insurer working in its home economy.
The current recession has been very different and the exposure of the
insurers is now international.
There is a further implication for companies as they trade out of recession
and into recovery. Barriers to trade within the EU (and, to a lesser extent,
internationally as a result of the successful conclusion of the Gatt talks)
have fallen, thus creating an intermediate category between domestic and
export sales, with the result that companies may be tempted to over-trade in
possibly still dangerous external markets and to multiply the
The regulatory environment will also present challenges to the credit
insurance industry. Regulation both leads and lags commercial reality in
different ways. Current levels of competition in the market are the result
of a sort of deregulation laid down by the EU's directives on insurance.
These have allowed commercial competition across borders and have outlawed
direct government intervention. Among the consequences has been the
privatisation of the short-term Insurance Services Group (ISG) of the
British government's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD).
The ISG was an anomaly among EU members where commercial credit insurance is
usually in the hands of a joint stock company responsible to its
shareholders.
The EU's encouragement of competition has been welcomed by customers. A
British company, for example, can choose its policy from a number of
insurers and obtain the right balance of premium and terms and conditions.
Insurers, too, welcome the level playing field across Europe and the
opportunities it brings. But there are concerns that the European
Commission's most recent proposals may be placing insurers in a possibly
inappropriate strait jacket.
The points at issue are usually called Callut and Tuffrau after the names of
the man and woman respectively who have headed up the Commission committees
examining short-term credit insurance and medium-term export credit (a
combined mechanism of insurance and banking to support large projects).
The Callut deliberations have concerned the nature of public and private
involvement in credit insurance in covering commercial and political risk.
There is widespread agreement that commercial risk (bankruptcy, say, or
protracted default) is properly the responsibility of the private sector,
but political risk (ranging from the non-availability of convertible
currency to war) has provoked different arguments.
NCM Credit Insurance, the British arm of the NCM group, insures both types
of risk, with the help of a small top-up contribution from the British
government intended to cover the gap until the private market is mature
enough to assume the whole risk.
The Tuffrau proposals are of less direct importance to the credit insurance
industry as such and have much greater political significance. In practice,
many EU countries (including the Netherlands) use their private insurers to
administer the medium term export credit system.
The differences are most stark between the British and their continental
colleagues. The UK, through ECGD, gives a full guarantee on export credits.
Other governments limit their exposure through the insurance mechanism.
Reinsurance is, in simple terms, a way for insurers to protect themselves by
passing on a proportion of their premium income in return for the
reinsurers' assuming a similar proportion of the risk. It also enables the
primary insurers effectively to borrow the capital of the reinsurers and
thus write more business than their own capital would support.
The difference between commercial and political risk has an impact on the
suppliers of reinsurance capacity: some reinsurers are enthusiastic
providers on the combined treaties of NCM Credit Insurance, while others
prefer to adopt a more conservative stance.
These three Rs affect all credit insurers and, as competition and
consolidation continue, their response will determine which of them will be
writing business in the next century - and which will be no more than
eminent names with proud histories.
Harry Groen is chairman of NCM Holding NV, Amsterdam.

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (26): The sceptics have been won over - UK
exports promotion / A look at the work of the UK's 'export ambassadors'
recruited from industry to share their knowledge and expertise of overseas
markets and to provide independent advice to exporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE COUNSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enthusiasm is often infectious - and in the case of the UK's Department of
Trade and Industry's Export Promoter Initiative, it is also producing
profitable results.
Exporters are traditionally sceptical about government plans to boost trade,
but they are slowly being won over by the initiative. There have been over
8,000 contacts between promoters and companies since the scheme got under
way 18 months ago and, although success is quantitatively difficult to
measure, the gap between Whitehall, business and industry has narrowed
palpably.
The link has been forged by 101 'export ambassadors' recruited from industry
to share their experience, knowledge and expertise of overseas markets and
to provide independent, impartial advice. Seconded for two years from the
ranks of the UK's top companies, the promoters present an 'exporter
friendly' and personal front to the administrative and desk operations of
export promotion.
Mixing metaphors, the promoters' aim 'is to be a 'bridge' . . . going out to
bat for business in the market.'
'I see myself as a marketing arm,' says Mr David Allen who has an
accumulated 37 years of experience in the Middle East and Africa. On
secondment from Glaxo Holdings with 16 years experience as sales director in
the region, he was previously with Roche Products for 21 years. Mr Allen
enthuses about the scheme, the diversity of his work and the opportunities
for British business in the Middle East.
He recently spent a day discussing the prospects of selling second-hand
machine tools to Yemen and the supply of Costwold stone for a mosque under
construction in Oman.
'I thoroughly enjoy my work,' he says. 'When you are in a particular sector,
you can become in danger of knowing more and more about less and less. Now I
have a broad brush.'
Beds are a favourite topic: he has been actively involved in a project to
franchise the manufacture of branded beds in Bahrain, a venture which
illustrates the difficulting of measuring 'results' in terms of numerical
targets - 'there's a limited time to achieve so much,' he says, noting that
large or complicated projects and ventures require months of preparatory
work before fruition.
The value of personal contact cannot be over-stated, he notes, adding that
this is particularly important in the Middle East where social meetings and
informal discussions are an integral part of the business environment.
This view is echoed by Mr James Lawday, whose promotion patch covers Egypt,
Lebanon and Syria - familiar turf from his 15 years in the Middle East for
John Laing International before his secondment to the promoter programme.
He has dealt with over 400 companies since joining the initiative 18 months
ago and has been encouraging British companies to increase their efforts in
Egypt, Syria and Lebanon.
UK companies have been slow off the mark in getting into Lebanon, he says,
although there are considerable opportunities in the reconstruction of the
devastated country. notably in contracting, installation and procurement.
In Syria, Mr Lawday notes there has been a considerable change in the
business climate - 'the country is much more warm and welcoming to business
than previously,' he says.
'There are many more opportunities for the private sector as the government
has been encouraging private money to return to the country.'
He has focused on medium to smaller businesses and covered an array of
sectors. This is exactly what the scheme was set up to do on the practical
level, dove-tailing with the DTI desk operations and information service in
the UK.
Mr Justin Davies at the DTI Egypt desk in London co-ordinates with Mr
Lawday, regional offices and commercial sections of British embassies abroad
to provide exporters with every aspect of assistance.
The DTI country desks handle direct calls by new exporters and rarely refers
them back to regional offices which can also be a first point of contact for
companies seeking new markets.
The country desk provides information on a country and helps with agency and
distribution agreements, background information on a country's economy, as
well as advice on the possible pitfalls.
Mr Davies describes the system as providing one point of contact for
exporters to tap into a wealth of contacts, information and assistance,
noting that this more pro-active approach and specific targeting has given
exporters clearer steers for their marketing efforts.
The DTI initiative covers the UK's top 80 markets which account for over 90
per cent of exports. Mr Ray Mingay, the director general of export promotion
at the DTI, says the Exporter Initiative will be extended by rolling forward
the programme and requesting companies to extend or renew their commitments
to seconding staff. The DTI will continue to meet operating and travel costs
of the promoters from its budget.
The prospect of extending the scheme seemed a less-than-remote possibility
in the early days. Mr Mingay laughs when he recalls the initial scepticism
over whether the initiative would get any, let alone enough, export
promoters to join the scheme.
Describing the scheme as an 'investment,' he says the points of contact for
business also include seminars, meetings and informal workshops.

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (27): Spanish breakthrough in new markets -
Analysis, European group initiative / Progress by a conglomerate of
companies in the Basque region of northern Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In late July, Icex, the export promotion arm of Spain's trade ministry,
organised a technology fair in Beijing at which 184 domestic companies put
their capital goods and machine tool products on show.
Danobat, a company specialising in the automotive industry, walked away from
Icex's Expotecnia fair with a Dollars 16m order to supply machinery for a
joint venture car plant in China that is planned by Japan's Suzuki group.
Early next year Fagor, a household white goods manufacturer, will open a
plant near Casablanca, Morocco, that, with an initial investment budget of
Dollars 6m, will manufacture 80,000 fridges a year for the North African
market.
Danobat and Fagor both form part of Mondragon Corporacion Cooperativa (MCC),
a conglomerate umbrella for 102 worker-ownership companies based in the
Basque region of northern Spain. The two of them adhere to the industrial
democracy and profit-sharing ideals that for the past 40 years have guided
the fortunes of the Mondragon movement.
What they also have in common is the strong export culture, and an incessant
search for new markets, that fuels much of Basque industry, the back-up of a
highly regarded applied research centre run by MCC that helps to tailor
products to clients and the supportive backing of a tightly managed,
profitable and far-seeing parent company. Danobat supplies mature automotive
markets in Europe, particularly in Germany and France, where its sales to
Volkswagen, Renault and other car manufacturing groups account for well over
half of the company's Dollars 110m annual turnover. Emerging markets, and
specifically China, are now poised to become a big earner for Danobat,
according to Mr Pedro Corral, the company's export manager.
'Earnings from China should double to Dollars 30m very quickly,' says Mr
Corral. Supplying the planned Suzuki plant in China was a breakthrough for
Danobat for it had had only minor links with the Japanese and it is now
bidding to supply established Danobat clients such as VW and Peugeot who are
also seeking to break into the Chinese market.
Fagor, the flagship of MCC's industrial empire, with annual sales of Dollars
173m, exports 35 per cent of its production. Its move into Morocco is the
most ambitious foreign investment to date by a domestic appliance group that
is likewise no stranger to overseas ventures; Fagor already boasts an
electronic unit that assembles semi-conductors in Thailand and a plant in
Mexico that produces components for household goods.
Mr Jesus Ginto of the MCC parent says the Moroccan fridge plant near
Casablanca could turn out to be a mere bridgehead for other important
business initiatives in North Africa.
If the initial investment brings rewards, Fagor will be expanding into
washing machines and water heaters. Already it has transferred its
home-grown technology in both products to Argentina and to Colombia in Latin
America.
Several factors lie behind the assault by both companies on the emerging
markets. The most important is the resources that they are able to draw on
through the MCC group.
The Ikerlan applied research faculty, at the MCC's nerve centre in Mondragon
(in the case of Danobat, the centre is complemented by the capital goods
company's own high tech development unit) is of key importance, but it only
partially explains the export succes story.
MCC officials stress the added value of the cooperative movement's
engineering and business schools which are likewise located at the Mondragon
nucleus and provide a constant stream of highly qualified candidates, up to
80 a year, for the corporation's expansion.
In their quest to develop an export culture, the schools recruit instructors
from other European centres, encourage students to participate in exchange
programmes, particularly in the UK, and place a high priority on language
skills.
Separate tuition courses, adapted to the needs of MCC's different
components, provide back-up training for the corporation's executives.
Danobat clinched its Suzuki deal at the trade fair organised by the
government's Icex export agency.
'Expotecnia was able to show that Spain is not just sunshine, flamenco and
fighting bulls,' says a Danobat manager - and the company concedes that it
is well covered, as it takes on its European competitors, by Spain's CSCE
export credit insurance.
But the consensus is that any company that places great store by official
export aid will fail to bring in the contracts.
By the same token, a competitive currency, as is the peseta which was
sharply devalued after 1992, can only provide a degree of support. In the
case of Danobat, the currency was a neutral issue as the company imports
components for its capital goods equipment.
The edge when breaking into competitive emerging markets comes in the
surefire combination of price plus quality plus service and for Spanish
companies there is a clear challenge in demonstrating the last two items in
the well-tried formula.
Danobat has worked hard at the Chinese market over the past four years. It
has teams of home-side sales people, drawn from its 60-strong marketing
staff, spending four to five week periods in relays in China working with
locally hired staff to attend existing clients and to search out new ones.
Fagor's break into Morocco drew on the resources of a specialised MCC unit
that scours emerging markets for joint venture opportunities.

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (25): East Devon targets the Philippines - Case
study, Asian business partnership / An unlikely venture launched from a
Georgian country house hotel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the unlikely setting of a Georgian country house hotel, on the banks of
the river Otter in east Devon, an export drive has been launched on the
Philippines.
It is a slightly improbable venture by the local business community. East
Devon is a rural part of south-west England. Agriculture and tourism are
leading industries; the largest town, Exmouth, has a population of 30,000.
The Range Rovers and tractors in the region's green lanes are a world away
from the exotic customised Jeepneys in the streets of Manila.
Manufacturing accounts for only 16 per cent of the east Devon workforce and,
with a mere handful of local companies employing more than 200 people,
south-east Asia has hardly featured as an export market.
The initiative, however, is serious. It is supported by East Devon district
council and the local enterprise agency while Mr Jesus Tambunting, the
Philippines' ambassador to the UK, is encouraging business links. Although
it is premature to judge the value of the venture, the first contacts by
Devon companies are being made.
The instigator is Mr Mike Connell, a London-born businessman who worked for
two decades in the Philippines as the Pacific Rim regional director of an
American welding group. He returned to England in the mid-1980s and has
settled in east Devon with his Filipino wife and four sons.
During the recession, he found local businessmen complaining of the
difficulty of exporting to continental Europe but unaware of the
possibilities of the huge south-east Asian market. In particular, they did
not realise that English was spoken in the Philippines which meant, for
example, that sales literature did not need to be translated.
'People here didn't understand the east,' he says. 'Very few could tell me
about the countries, and they were worried about the languages, distance and
cost,' he says. 'I thought one could short-circuit this by offering a
service to any company to help them to get into the market.'
Last year, he set up a small consultancy and agency with the grandiose name
of Global Exports, but concentrating on the Philippines as a gateway to
south-east Asia.
'What has disturbed me with the Department of Trade &amp; Industry is the lack
of understanding of what small industry needs. The people in the DTI are
good people and well-trained, but the gap is that there is no one who knows
how to get out into the market place.'
He contacted the local enterprise agency, East Devon Small Industries Group
 -'we discussed how to get the message across to people, and as a first step
decided to hold a seminar last March.' The Conservative-controlled East
Devon district council backed the campaign and Devon &amp; Cornwall training and
enterprise council financed the seminar at the Deer Park Hotel, set in 25
acres of parkland near Honiton. As a result, Mr Connell flew to Manila with
instructions to represent seven businesses, ranging from a language school
to two engineering companies - 'I decided to concentrate on joint ventures.
In Asia, what they desperately need is knowhow - they don't need us to stick
things in a container and ship it out to them.'
He met with President Fidel Ramos and capitalised on the fact that 'I'm on
first-name terms with most of the ministers involved in exports.' He is
optimistic that orders or agreements will materialise for most or all of his
clients.
The next step was an official visit to east Devon in July by the ambassador
and vice-consul, which included a briefing by them for over 100 business
people at the Deer Park Hotel and a dinner hosted by the council.
Mr Tambunting told the Devonians there were three good reasons for moving
into or doing business with the Philippines: 'The strategic location, the
relatively low-cost of living, and the presence of a highly educated,
hard-working and English-speaking labour force.' The country, he said,
wanted to lessen its own export reliance on the American and Japanese
markets.
Mr Geoffrey Hulley, director of East Devon Small Industries Group, believes
Devon companies should take advantage of the encouragement by the Philippine
government. He sees it as 'a marvellous opportunity for small businesses
here to get a foothold.'
How firm a foothold has yet to be seen. One of the companies represented in
Manila by Mr Connell was Sheerspeed UK, an independent company employing
eight people making industrial modular shelters and work tents.
Mr Maurice Smith, chairman and managing director, says: 'There are a couple
of companies willing to distribute our products there, although there is
nothing concrete as yet, but we're always hopeful. The idea is to sell there
first with the ultimate aim that our products would then be manufactured
under licence.'
Another company is Cardew Designs, which makes handmade collectable teapots
and has grown rapidly to a turnover of Pounds 3m a year. It already exports
60 per cent of its products including to the Pacific Rim, though not to the
Philippines. Mr Peter Kirvan, partner of Cardew Designs, says he is
appreciative of the efforts and enthusiasm but also sceptical.
'I question whether the Philippines warrants the effort being put into it
relative to other markets such as the US,' he says.' I sometimes think the
priorities are a little skewed. Shouldn't we be looking at the best
potential target and focusing it that way?'
Meanwhile, funding is likely to be sought for a trade mission to Manila. Mr
Bernard Hughes, chairman of East Devon council's economy and employment
committee, sees the campaign as an imaginative way in which businesses can
find new markets - 'it's all about promoting and creating the climate in
which small firms can prosper,' he says. 'When Mike Connell came to us with
his expertise and the enterprise agency as a partnership, we were more than
delighted to be part of it. We seem to be getting it right. It comes down to
personalities and enthusiasm.'

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (24): A way through the payments barrier -
Countertrade case study / A UK company's innovative wool trading deal in
Kazakhstan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN BELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exporting to countries suffering a shortage of hard currency for imports is
a perennial problem for both buyers and sellers.
However, one company, Bradford-based Clendon (UK), has found a way through
the payments barrier by assembling an innovative countertrade transaction to
facilitate the sale of wool processing equipment to Kazakhstan.
Countertrade is the umbrella term for barter, counterpurchase and other
forms of reciprocal trading. It often requires patience and persistence in
equal doses to make deals workable - and profitable.
Clendon has profited from working in a niche market that it knows well -
wool processing equipment and wool trading.
Some countertrade deals can take years to negotiate and implement. However,
in Clendon's case its deal to supply a USDollars 3m wool-washing plant to
Kazakhstan in exchange for wool, evolved relatively smoothly and swiftly.
Clendon recognised the requirement for wool-processing equipment in the
southern republics of the former Soviet Union, and was equally aware of the
availability of the required mix of new and re-furbished plant for export in
the region.
The problem, though, was how to get paid. Banks in the UK and New Zealand,
where much of the plant was to be sourced, were unwilling to provide
appropriate trade finance, says Clendon's managing director Malcolm Ebbage.
'The normal UK banks wouldn't even look at the deal. In addition, the banks
wouldn't even consider our wool stocks as collateral,' he says. The only
alternative was to go it alone - with a countertrade payment mechanism
involving Kazakh wool.
The deal, for the export of plant totalling Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.90m), was
signed in May last year with Kazakhstan's Tulpar Company. The plant, now
delivered and constructed at Dzhambul, 350km west of Almaty, is expected to
be fully operational by late October this year. The deal had the full
approval of the Kazakh authorities who are keen to upgrade their industries
and add value to raw materials. In addition, purchasing reconditioned
equipment, allowed the Kazakhs to save on overall costs.
Clendon has been paid and all parties are satisfied with the way the
operation has been structured. The success of this deal, in what is
generally deemed a difficult market, has encouraged Clendon to develop
similar transactions.
The washing plant equipment was predominantly second-hand and of New Zealand
origin. It was brought to the UK for reconditioning and then exported to
Kazakhstan. The new plant component of the contract comprised specialist
effluent treatment equipment manufactured in New Zealand by a subsidiary of
Sweden's Tetra-Laval Group. On the key issue of funding, Mr Ebbage comments:
'We had to do it off our own bat.' The company drew on its own limited
financial resources, but, says Mr Ebbage, 'crucially, we had a substantial
volume of wool shipped out of Kazakhstan before we exported the equipment.
After that, the deal was more or less self-financing.'
The initial wool deliveries accounted for around 25 per cent of the
contracted amount and facilitated the first equipment deliveries.
Subsequently, Clendon made sure it received shipments of wool before making
further equipment deliveries to Kazakhstan.
The other essential component of the deal was selling the wool - into a
market very familiar to Clendon, thus avoiding the cost of employing outside
traders.
The principal destination for the Kazakh wool was China. However, there were
further profitable twists to the deal, says Mr Ebbage, including adding
value to the wool in the UK before re-exporting. The wool was graded and put
through combing machines in the UK to add value to the product before it was
shipped to China.
Moreover, the Kazakh company's insistence that Clendon should also take a
proportion of the barter payments in local karakul wool in addition to prime
merino wool, also provided Clendon with another commercial opportunity.
A dark grey product with very limited use, karakul is used mainly in carpets
and blankets. Clendon sold karakul in the west and in India. But, again,
this added value to much of this product, generating a healthy return,
according to Mr Ebbage.
The product came west through Poland, where Clendon began working with a
Polish blanket manufacturer - 'we've just sold 25,000 karakul blankets to
the Polish state,' says Mr Ebbage. 'Many are also being purchased by the
humanitarian aid agencies; Oxfam bought 30,000.'
'The deal with Tulpar worked well because we always tried to keep ahead of
the game.' he adds. 'We hope that now our banks have seen this success, they
will be more positive in the future.'
Meanwhile, the company is setting up similar deals: in Kazakhstan, it has
begun bringing out further supplies of wool against the supply of around
Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.5m) worth of wool combing and spinning equipment of UK
origin. As the deal progresses, Clendon will also take Kazakh cattle hides
and sheep skins as payment. In addition, it is planning an agreement to
supply another Dollars 3m wool-washing plant to an enterprise in southern
Russia.

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (22): Sales are up but jobs numbers fall -
Analysis / Review of the FT's latest list of Top 100 UK Exporters and finds
that there has been little movement among leading companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The improvement in the world economy, the growing competitiveness in some
sectors of UK industry, and the 1992 devaluation of sterling left many of
the top British exporters enjoying strong sales growth abroad last year.
However, the FT's latest survey of leading exporters suggests that the
overall growth in exports did not lead to much job creation within the UK,
with most of the more successful exporters reducing workforces during the
year in an attempt to achieve greater productivity.
Overall, the survey indicates that there has been little significant
movement in the ranking of top exporters, with foreign-owned companies still
representing a large proportion of the export table.
The rankings of the three largest exporters, British Aerospace, British
Petroleum and Shell UK, remain unchanged amid good export growth. Together
they account for about a quarter of the total export sales of the top 100.
Shell and British Petroleum benefited from a strong performance in the North
Sea oil and gas sector, boosted in recent months by a number of new fields
coming on stream. A spokesman for BP said: 'The main growth has come from
oil and gas - it's mostly down to the North Sea.'
Further down the table, the rankings showed more change. Zeneca, which
entered the top 100 in 1992, after Imperial Chemicals Industry hived off its
bioscience subsidiary, turned in an extremely healthy export performance.
The group jumped from 10th to seventh place, with a 19.4 per cent increase
in exports during the year.
Mr Steve Mayo, finance director at Zeneca, said that the company was
'extremely proud' of its export contribution. Although the group's main
markets were still the US and Europe, increasing sales in the Far East and
Latin America had contributed to the export growth, he said. However, he
pointed out that the company's performance overall appeared to be flattered
by the export figures themselves, because the total actual sales increase
during the year had been slightly lower, at about 12 per cent, than the
growth in exports. 'This is probably a better guide to the underlying
performance,' he added.
ICI fared slightly worse, slipping from seventh to ninth place during the
year, with only a 4.3 per cent growth in exports. Meanwhile, Ford Motors,
the UK market leader in the vehicle sector, fell to eighth from fourth. The
drop partly reflected difficult trading conditions in Europe's car market,
with Ford's exports to Europe falling by 24.4 per cent in the year. Although
Nissan Motors largely shrugged off these problems, showing a 6.9 per cent
export growth into Europe during the year, the European recession also
affected Vauxhall, where exports fell by 44.9 per cent. The drop dragged
Vauxhall's ranking down to 31 from 15.
One star performer in the table, however, was Compaq, the US-owned computer
group which has been rapidly building its market share in Europe after
establishing production sites in Scotland seven years ago. The group leapt
from 25th to 13th during the year, on the back of an impressive 113 per cent
increase in exports. Most of this growth was targeted on Europe, where
exports rose by 138.8 per cent as the company benefited not only from
increased demand for portable computers but also from a greater market
share. After being ranked as the fourth largest PC supplier in Europe in
1992, Compaq is now estimated to have the largest share of the European
market, after being number two last year.
This growth in the computer market appears to have benefited other
companies, such as International Business Machines.
Overall, however, the table does not indicate particularly strong sectoral
trends. Although the UK's strength in the world chemicals industry was
underlined by good performances from companies such as Glaxo, the star
performers among the smaller companies came from a range of industries.
British American Tobacco, for example, saw exports grow by 30 per cent,
primarily as a result of expansion into Asian and other non-European
markets. Marks &amp; Spencer, the retailers, saw exports grow by 21.9 per cent,
pushing the company up from 56th to 27th in the rankings.
One theme that does emerge from the table is that with Europe in deep
recession during most of 1993, much of the strongest growth came from
markets outside the European Union, particularly in the US and Far East.
Hillsdown, the food producer, for example, saw exports grow by 21.2 per cent
overall, but fall by 1.8 per cent in Europe. Thorn EMI saw a similar
pattern, with a 2 per cent growth in overall exports and a 7 per cent fall
in European markets. Meanwhile, Vosper Thorneycroft, the defence contractor,
saw exports grow by 35.2 per cent in the year, but fall by 5.9 per cent in
Europe.
Mr Martin Jay, managing director at Vosper Thorneycroft, said that the
strongest export markets had been in the Middle East and Gulf. 'In the past
five years we have increased productivity in steel ships by 50 per cent,' he
said.
Another trend apparent from the survey is that the growth in exports has not
necessarily led to significant job increases. Nearly all of the 15 top
exporters cut their workforce during the year, with the only exception being
Nissan Motors, which is expanding its production in the UK.
The employee cuts were not necessarily related to the export growth. Shell
UK, for example, saw export growth of 25.4 per cent during the year - but
reduced its workforce by 12.3 per cent. At the other end of the spectrum,
Arjo Wiggins reduced its workforce by 7.6 per cent, after achieving 8.4 per
cent export growth in the year.
Some of these cuts may not have reflected redundancies - BP, for example,
points out that its 22.6 per cent reduction in its workforce also reflected
divestment of a number of subsidiaries. However, in many cases they suggest
that companies are continuing to seek increasingly high levels of
productivity on which to base any future export growth.

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (20): Lloyd's re-awakens to trade credit risk -
Private market export credit insurance / A move back into direct commercial
export credit risk underwriting by Lloyd's of London is part of a continuing
trend towards a broader market for export credit insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GODIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New facilities for direct commercial export credit risk underwriting at
Lloyd's will complement the services offered in the UK by mainstream
short-term credit insurers. These services are led by NCM and Trade
Indemnity, but additionally include the specialist departments of a number
of other insurers, including, for example, Sun Alliance and Commercial
Union.
Despite difficult worldwide trading conditions in recent years, there has
often been a marked reluctance by exporters to make use of export credit
insurance. The lack of appropriate insurance cover for markets outside OECD
countries has arguably been partly responsible; but many exporters have also
been unwilling to pay premium costs which they regard in some cases as too
high.
Premium costs have to some extent been dictated by high claim levels
resulting from company failures during the recession.
However, another influential factor has been developments at Lloyd's, where
the cost of reinsuring commercial risk has been affected by a reduction in
available capacity. Lloyd's internal wranglings aside, this reflected the
market's overall difficult claims experience across a broad range of core
insurance sectors, such as marine indemnity.
Other smaller sectors were also affected, including political risk cover for
export deals. The latter offers exporters insurance against, for example, an
act of government preventing a buyer making payment and, since the early
1920s, has been the only form of trade export credit cover directly
available from the market.
Against this background, the private insurance market is generally seeking
to provide a broader range of cover options which cost-effectively meet
exporters' requirements.
This move is particularly important given the global privatisation trend
which is creating a vast number of private sector foreign buyers which do
not have the secure, direct support of government. The private insurance
market is deemed by many to be particularly suited to analysing risk
perceptions and subsequently meeting exporters' needs in this key area.
The launch in early September of Lloyd's International Trade Credit
Insurance Facility led by Hiscox Syndicate 33, with the backing of other
syndicates, is an integral part of this trend. This facility will provide
commercial, or buyer, risk associated with the provision of export credits.
Although Lloyd's syndicates have been active in providing political risk
cover, they had previously been excluded from commercial underwriting since
the 1920s due to difficulties the market experienced with this form of
cover.
'This facility will ensure that London is at the centre of the trade credit
insurance world,' says Charles Berry of the co-ordinating broker for the
facility, Berry, Palmer &amp; Lyle, (BPL).
Under the terms of this new facility, exporters will be able to insure
individual commercial risks to an upper limit of around Dollars 5m.
Participating syndicates will not be allowed to receive more than 2 per cent
of premium income from this new business.
The facility is expected to concentrate on areas of risk outside the domain
of mainstream trade credit insurance - 'very generally, we are not looking
to compete head-to-head for business already written well by NCM, France's
Coface and Germany's Hermes,' says Mr Berry.
A strength of the market is that it can transcend national boundaries - 'we
are just as interested in a Mexican company selling to the UK as a UK
company selling to Mexico. The whole market is very under-developed,
although UK and OECD exporters are relatively well-served,' he says.
Meanwhile, there is also considerable potential for exporters to access
insurance outside the Lloyd's market, from established companies such as
American International Group (AIG), or newer insurers such as the
Paris-based Unistrat Assurances or the Bermuda-registered Exporters
Insurance Company, (EIC).
For companies able to sustain an initial Dollars 100,000 outlay, the 'group
captive' framework available from EIC may prove an effective vehicle to
insure export credits.
EIC may be in a position to assist companies whose credit insurance
requirements cannot be adequately met on the open market, according to
Maurice Drage, EIC's UK consultant and representative.
Qualification for membership of a 'group captive' involves the exporter in
the purchase of a shareholding. In the case of EIC, this is worth 5 per cent
of the deal they are negotiating. The minimum shareholding of Dollars
100,000 provides a new member with immediate access to Dollars 2m worth of
cover. EIC will cover individual deals up to a maximum of Dollars 6.6m.
EIC cover is particularly suited to exporters selling to the larger newly
industrialised countries, such as Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, but can also
cover deals in niche markets such as international metals shipments in
eastern European and CIS countries.
'We are not the entire solution to insurance in this area - but a supplement
to capacity elsewhere,' says Mark Reynolds, EIC's New York-based
vice-president.

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (21): Rush to pass the parcel - 'Reverse
deliveries' directive / The pressure is on the distribution industry to help
solve the problems of packaging waste management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY BUSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission's plans to reduce waste are going to have a
wide-ranging impact on transport and packaging companies in all member
countries, and as a result on exporters.
In a proposed directive earlier this year on packaging and packaging waste,
the Commission said it would like 90 per cent of packaging removed from the
waste stream, and of that 90 per cent, 60 per cent to be recycled, 30 per
cent to be incinerated and 10 per cent to be used for landfill.
At its simplest, the directive aims to reduce the amount of waste packaging
disposed of, by requiring member-states to implement national schemes to
achieve specified recycling and recovery targets.
The four principal provisions of the directive are:
Member-states will have to establish return and management systems for waste
packaging disposed of by a consumer or final user.
Adoption of a marking and coding system to be displayed on packaging
signifying its acceptability for recovery, re-use and recycling.
Harmonisation of standards for the design and construction of packaging
intended to be recycled or recovered. (Various national standards will be
considered equivalent initially, but, eventually, a series of European
standards will be devised by the Commission).
Member-states will have to set up harmonised national databases of packaging
data for the monitoring of targets, and the reporting of progress towards
their achievement.
The precise terms of the directive will not be known until later this
autumn. The European Parliament disagreed with some of the proposals and
called for a number of amendments which the Commission has refused to
accept. Because of this deadlock a conciliation committee was asked to
advise on possible amendments before the directive went to the Council of
Ministers.
Some concern is being expressed, however, over where responsibility will lie
and what the ramifications might be, not just for the transport and
packaging industries but for the retail trade as a whole.
Ultimately, the directive is likely to bring the costs of packaging,
recycling and recovery within the overall costs of distribution. This, in
turn, will prompt users to review the type and quantity of packaging being
used so as to minimise those costs.
Already distributors of retail goods are exploring ways of substituting
intermediate levels of packaging with re-usable display pallets and are
assessing the suitability of standard outer packaging for transport.
According to Andy Robson, director of the UK Institute of Grocery
Distribution, the big retailers have been recycling secondary packaging for
many years - 'most have it taken to central warehouses, from where it is
removed on a contract basis. The new directive will simply be an extension
of that movement.'
However, at this stage, the Freight Transport Association would like to see
clarification of who is going to be responsible for the handling of waste
packaging.
'Experience from the functioning of the German packaging regulations (widely
known as the Green Dot system because of the mark put on packaging to show
it is recyclable) suggests that road transport operators delivering goods to
commercial or private customers may be burdened with the task of removing
packaging waste and transporting it to a suitable recycling point.'
This practice is commonly known as reverse deliveries or, reverse logistics,
and, for carriers, it is at the heart of the matter. Brian Bolam, managing
director of TNT Contract Logistics (Europe) is quite clear about the onus of
responsibility. 'The burden is on the originator,' he says.
Transport companies' main concern, however, is that some of their clients
might make the placing of their business dependent on the carrier's agreeing
to handle waste, thus reducing the carriers' profitability.
The Freight Transport Association is also worried about the market for
recovered packaging, which it claims could seriously affect the viability of
the UK national recycling scheme unless genuine demand for recovered
materials can be found.
'This needs to be resolved so that transport operators delivering goods are
not left holding the baby due to the collapse of suitable outlets,' says the
FTA.
A similar point is made by Michael Brown, professor of transport at the
University of Westminster, in London. He says the German legislation led to
mountains of material for recycling. A similar Europe-wide scheme could
affect the entire packaging market, he believes.
It is not just that demand for new packaging would decline and plenty of
recycled packaging become available, but that industry's aim would be to use
less packaging as a whole. There would also be technical challenges. While
steel, aluminium, paper and glass are technically easy to recycle, plastics
pose difficulties. Prof Brown says some see the nub of the problem simply as
the fact that there is just too much packaging.
Others argue that, if packaging is minimised, products might suffer - food
could be tainted or products break in transit. The questions surrounding the
directive may, however, be more fundamental. Dr David Guest, operations
director at UK-based PIRA, an independent technology organisation for the
packaging, paper, printing and publishing industries, says the key question
is whether the directive will it be implemented.
He sees two main problems. Firstly, some EU members, principally Germany and
Belgium, do not consider the directive's proposals to be as strong as their
own national legislation. Secondly, some other countries are concerned about
the costs involved.

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (19): New network plans gather speed - European
transport / The drawing board is now firmly in place to help provide Europe
with a vastly improved transport system by the start of the new millennium
</HEADLINE>

TRANSPORT: Integrated projects such as the Channel Tunnel, new high speed
rail networks and motorways will help ease Europe's transport bottlenecks
Big growth in freight traffic in the Single Market has put the European
Union's infrastructure under increasing strain. From 1985 to 1990, road
tonnage on internal EU journeys increased by 26 per cent from Denmark to
around 50 per cent from most other countries to a massive 110 per cent from
the UK. The only country for which figures showed a decrease for that period
was West Germany, down 8 per cent.
The economic slowdown which characterised the early 1990s is certain to have
slowed down the rate of growth since, but according to Simon Chapman,
economist for the Freight Transport Association, 'now we are out of
recession there will be growth again, especially as more companies continue
to exploit opportunities in eastern Europe.'
His views echo those held by the EU, and plans for what has now been dubbed
the Trans-European Transport Network are gathering speed.
Last December, Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, set up
a group of transport experts under Danish commissioner Henning
Christophersen to look at 40 proposals mooted for the network. Their brief
was to identify 10 priority projects that should be put under way as rapidly
as possible.
Among other criteria needing to be considered, a Brussels White Paper set
out that each one had to 'have a positive economic impact, including
improvements in the Community's competitiveness and technological
performance; contribute to important Community objectives such as economic
and social cohesion; allow scope for private investment in a broad sense;
and be 'mature' so that they can be realised quickly.'
Henning Christophersen has now reported back, and work on the following is
said to have either begun or is 'likely to begin within two years':
The Brenner axis (high speed train/combined transport).
A high speed train linking Paris-Brussels-Cologne-Amsterdam-London (the
Channel Tunnel is part of this scheme).
A high speed train between Madrid, Barcelona and Perpignan, which will also
link Madrid with Victoria and Dax.
A high speed train going east from Paris to Metz and Strasbourg. There will
also be junctions joining Metz with Luxembourg and with Saarbrucken and
Mannheim. In Germany itself, a similar service will run between Munich,
Nuremberg, Erfurt, Halle/Leipzig and Berlin.
A combined transport/conventional rail system from Rotterdam to the German
border and the Rhine and the Ruhr.
A high speed rail/combined transport system between Lyon and Turin.
A motorway between Patras, in Greece, and the Bulgarian border, together
with a west-east motorway corridor via Ignatia, Igoumenitsa, Thessaloniki
and Alexandroupolis.
A motorway between Lisbon and Valladolid.
A rail link between Cork, Dublin, Belfast, Larne and Stranraer.
An airport at Malpensa, Milan.
The total cost of these projects is estimated at Ecu68bn, (Dollars 84.32bn
or Pounds 53.51bn) of which the EU will provide between Ecu 15bn and Ecu
20bn from regional funding. The remainder will be raised through private
investment.
Martin Richards, director, Brussels, for the Freight Transport Association
and the association's Permanent Representative to the Community, said the EU
had both the desire and the will to create an integrated infrastructure. It
recognised the importance of this not just because of the needs of the
Single Market, but also because of the liberalisation of eastern Europe.
There was a likelihood that several countries from that region would join
the Union. But, even if they did not, there would still be a big increase in
trade as the eastern region looked more towards the west, said Mr Richards.
The EU also had a strong desire to encourage the development of inter-modal
systems - which is the movement of goods by a variety of means. One of the
principal aims was to make more use of rail and waterway systems to reduce
the numbers (and effects) of lorries on the roads.
But this, said Richards, should not be confused with what was termed the
'network routes.'
The latter was about integration - that is, if a new port was built, then
both a road and a railway should link up with it and there should, if
possible, be an airport nearby. He added that the Commission was taking a
particular interest in the resurgence of coastal shipping, which, as well as
freeing crowded roads from traffic, could be used for feeding inland
waterway systems.
Although the EU itself does not get involved in inter-modal projects as
such, some years ago it started a funding programme to encourage private and
state enterprise to pursue projects believed to be worthwhile.
Called PACT (the Programme of Assistance for Combined Transport), it pays
for studies, market research and trials for approved projects. One recent
PACT funding has been for a comprehensive study looking at piggy-backing -
the loading of trailers (rather than containers from trailers) on to trains.
To win approval, a project must be genuinely inter-modal and pan-European.
Several advances towards increasing inter-modal transportation have taken
place recently, including, of course, the Channel Tunnel.
Two other projects considered particularly significant have been the UK
government's agreement to allow an increase in weight (38 tonnes to 44
tonnes) for lorries feeding railheads; and the start of a twice-weekly train
service between Rotterdam and Verona, where there is a large terminal for
onward movements.
The Freight Transport Association is, says Martin Richards, in favour of
inter-modal systems - 'but,' he points out, 'it's not the panacea that many
environmentalists believe. As laudable as the aims are, the vast majority of
journeys, apart from in large countries like France, are only about 40
miles.
'Clearly, such short trips are not worth the effort and cost of double
handling; and, in some cases, and in the UK in particular, railway networks
are not extensive enough - they don't go where they used to, or where they
ought to.'

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (18): Eximbank asserts US drive for exports -
Exports and aid / The wiles of Wall Street are being applied in the fight
for emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chairman of the US Export-Import bank, Mr Kenneth Brody, is taking
increasingly assertive steps to win export markets for the US. In
particular, the former investment banker is attempting to counter other
governments' practice of tying aid to export contracts with developing
countries.
Using a Dollars 150m 'war chest' - the Tied Aid Capital Projects Fund, which
with leverage can raise up to Dollars 500m-Dollars 600m - Eximbank is
attempting to head off other countries' offers with its own, matching
promises of tied aid.
'I believe American jobs are created by American exports,' said Mr Brody.
'The way to get there (to an elimination of tied aid) to is to show the
other countries that their tied aid offers won't get them any benefit.'
The programme has infuriated US rivals who are accustomed to a US government
operating above the commercial fray.
For years, Republican administrations preached to their industrialised
competitors the joys of unsubsidised financing. This resulted in 1992 in an
agreement by countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) to reduce the use of tied aid.
The pact established a notification process requiring governments to inform
the OECD 30 days before making tied aid offers. During that period other
governments can challenge the proposed offer as ineligible under the OECD
pact. Rules prohibit tied aid to upper income and upper middle income
developing countries which are ineligible for World Bank loans of 17 and 20
years. This excludes Brazil, Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan and Venezuela.
The rules eliminate some commercially viable projects, which could attract
standard commercial loans because they can quickly generate sufficient
revenues to service the debt, and they create tied aid 'free zones' in
Mexico, central and eastern Europe, Russia, Ukraine, five other former
Soviet republics, and the Baltic.
The pact has slowed but not ended the practice, however. Last year, tied aid
funding fell to Dollars 6.9bn from Dollars 15.5bn in 1992. But US officials,
noting an increase of tied aid offers in the first four months of this year,
fear it may be rebounding.
Until April, Eximbank only acted if the US believed its rivals violated the
rules of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Under
its new policy, it matches offers even if no rules are broken.
Since then the bank's board has approved nine tied aid offers and turned
down one out of concern about its military aspects. In its half yearly
report to Congress it claimed success in deflecting foreign tied aid offers
for many commercial projects, including manufacturing facilities, power
plants, power transmission lines and equipment, hydropower plants, and
telephone equipment.
Eximbank insists it offers tied aid financing only after foreign offers have
been relayed to the OECD and have cleared multilateral consultation
procedures.
The bank's plan is to reserve most US tied aid to challenge foreign offers
which would lock in a long-term commercial advantage for competitors to US
companies and for deals which would allow US companies to exploit early
market penetration opportunities.
When foreign tied aid offers are on the table conditionally or informally,
but the OECD has not been notified, the US will issue a Tied Aid Letter of
Interest, promising to match the competitor's terms. The letter can be
converted into a tied aid preliminary commitment when a foreign offer is
passes through the OECD procedures.
On occasions it has received advance word that competitors are planning to
offer tied aid and rushed in with a 'no aid common line.' Where this is
rejected, Eximbank indicates to US companies that it would look with favour
on a request for a matching offer. It will also contact the rival government
to indicate its plans to match. The level of concessionality and the risk
involved in a tied aid offer discourages Eximbank bidding.
'Our board would not want to match pure grants,' an official says. 'We're
not in the business of totally giving things away.'
Under Mr Brody's leadership, which has brought the chutzpah and wiles of
Wall Street to Exim Bank, its total lending, guarantees and insurance could
reach Dollars 15bn for the second year in a row. He has re-organised the
bank for its role as a key player in a US export drive, pushed project
finance to new heights, boosted US firms in the 'emerging markets' and
promoted foreign sales of US environmental products.

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (17): The banks face tough demands - Trade
finance services / Efficient financing is vital for effective export
promotion. Alan Mackie looks at the way two banks, the UK's Barclays and
Germany's Commerzhank, organise and manage export financing services
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Barclays Bank is still the biggest of the 'big four' UK banks, despite a
bruising shake-out over the past two years. Its strength in export finance
is built on a network of over 1,000 overseas branches in more than 70
countries, which provide market intelligence on local conditions and credit
risk. It has developed a range of trade finance products tailored to the
most complex demands of buyers - be it an ECGD based package, a deal
involving forfaiting, credit insurance, factoring or a combination of
different products.
Factoring is a popular payment mechanism because it generates immediate
cash. Barclays also does a fair amount of invoice discounting in addition to
conventional confirmation of letters of credit (l/cs).
Barclays has two special schemes, Tradeline and Tradeflow. Tradeline is a
short term financing facility for exporters that already have insurance.
This enables an exporter to offer credit to foreign buyers with whom it has
never traded before. Tradeflow is a short-term revolving loan facility
backed by Barclays own credit insurance policy that provides credit for
businesses with an export turnover of less than Pounds 2m a year. Unlike
conventional cover, which is taken out on total turnover, this scheme offers
the small exporter insurance on individual export orders, as long as finance
is taken.
Conventional ECGD backed buyer and supplier credits can be extended up to 10
years - or more, depending on country and product - and deals can be
negotiated in a broad range of foreign currencies. Barclays also specialises
in combining ECA cover with other products and services. General lines of
credit are put in place with overseas banks to facilitate this kind of
trade.
A forfait can be popular because of its user friendliness and great
flexibility. It provides up to 100 per cent finance on a non-recourse basis,
meaning that, unless exporters are in some way in default, they will not
have to return funding if, for example, the buyer subsequently does not make
payment. Barclays also arranges leasing finance and syndicated structured
loans for bigger export orders.
Services are organised by customer need: the provision of finance; payment
protection; and assistance with payment collection. The starting point is
the local branch manager. Branches are equipped to deal with all short term
finance (up to one year), as well as the Tradeline and Tradef low schemes.
Where more specialised or medium term assistance is required, customers are
channelled to more specialised departments.
Enquiries, for example, for longer term credit or for more specialised
services are referred either to the regional international manager or the
director of the trade finance unit who, having established the specific
service needed, will direct the business to the requisite department.
An invoice presented for factoring is referred through the regional
international manager to Barclays Commercial Service which acts as the
exporter's factor and makes a service charge. A leasing enquiry is referred
to Barclays Leasing and a request for a buyer credit or project finance
structure is directed to Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
The export financing efforts of the 'big four' banks draw faint praise from
the Institute of Export whose recent survey of exporters' experience of
banking services found small to medium-sized exporters, who account for 56
per cent of UK exports, unhappy with the general lack of understanding of
their problems by local bank managers and the trend towards greater
centralisation. Barclays has, to some extent, met this charge with its
Tradeflow scheme for small exports.
One practical complaint, meanwhile, is the way that foreign receivables  -
even from blue chip European companies - are shrugged away as collateral by
British banks.
The Institute would like the banking industry to start thinking European.
Top management is aware of the need to change these hidebound insular ways,
but some old habits can die hard.
Commerzbank is an old established medium-sized German bank. Its 12 per cent
share of total German foreign trade is only eclipsed by Deutsche Bank and
Dresdner Bank. What it lacks in muscle, it has to make up with reliability,
a fast response time to executing orders and being flexible to customers'
requirements.
It offers a wide range of payment services for German exporters to receive
export proceeds and is in a position to provide various kinds of short-term
financing including: overdraft facilities, short-term loans up to 360 days
at fixed interest, discounting of Bills of Exchange with recourse to
exporters, discounting of receivables resulting from deferred payment and
l/cs confirmed by Commerzbank without recourse to the exporter.
Subject to the bank's readiness to assume country risk, the bank is prepared
either to confirm l/cs if so instructed by the opening bank and, in the
absence of such an instruction, to accommodate the exporter with silent
confirmation.
The bank also offers a range of guarantees/bonds including bid bonds,
performance bonds and payment/downpayment guarantees.
Medium-term export financing in Germany is highly competitive. Around 50 per
cent is spoken for by Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW), the
government-owned finance provider.
Unlike the commercial banks, KfW is not required to make a profit and
recently had its charter changed to enable it to bid for OECD business -
although its roots are still firmly in emerging markets and the developing
world.
Much competition focuses on the 15 per cent of commercial risk (down and
interim payment) not covered by Hermes, the official German export credit
insurer.
The main medium-term export business is in buyer credits. Commerzbank
evaluates the rating of the borrower's country, the rating of the borrower
(and what collateral it has outside the country), as well as the status of
the German exporter, before determining what part of the commercial risk it
is prepared to take on.
Supplier credits are less popular because there is still some recourse to
the German exporter in the event of default. Hermes does not insure general
credit lines, but Commerzbank arranges credit lines with foreign banks which
are a way for foreign importers, approved by Commerzbank, to purchase German
goods and services. Once a German supplier has been found and approved, the
deal can be covered by Hermes.
Commerzbank offers a variety of ways for the exporter to cover its exposure.
A common one is a forfait financing. Commerzbank runs a four-person unit
providing this service. The bank also arranges Euroloans mainly through its
affiliates and branches in Singapore, Luxembourg and London to cover the
commercial financing of big export orders.
Exporters have become far more street-wise in approaching banks for finance
and are more prepared to shop around. The big exporters are hiring foreign
exchange dealers and other specialists to better define their export finance
needs. Nevertheless, there is still a demand from small to medium sized
exporters for advice on how to package their needs.
The first point of contact is the local branch which usually deals with all
credit requests under one year.
The general rule is that any business that falls within a framework of
standardi sed loans may be done at branch level, including certain foreign
country risk assessments related to the confirmation of l/cs. But all medium
to long term loan business has to be referred to head office.
When it comes to obtaining supplier/buyer credits banks and exporters will
generally approach Hermes in tandem.
Sometimes an exporter will come with export cover already confirmed.
German exporters arguably appear to have a better relationship with their
banks than their UK counterparts - perhaps reflecting a culture which some
regard as more consciously 'international.'
Their focus is shifting to seeking additional or alternative finance in the
countries to which they are exporting - as well as in Germany. Local banks
also face increasing competition from specialised export financing banks
within Germany and Europe as a whole, and from international credit insurers
 -a trend welcomed by German exporters, says Hans Juergen Mueller, managing
director of the Federal Association of German Export Trade.

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (15): A valuable selling point - Islamic trade
finance / Demand for Islamic trade finance is set to increase significantly
over the next few years as economic liberalisation measures finally take
hold in a number of Islamic countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MUSHTAK PARKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For companies selling into the Muslim world, Islamic trade finance has
emerged as an increasingly available - and used - option for funding deals.
Its appeal for ethical and commercial reasons to importers in 46 Islamic
countries can be an important selling point.
The access to funding it provides offers the potential to increase an
exporter's capacity to sell into markets where other forms of financing may
be constrained. It does this by tapping funds available in the Islamic
banking system, which are variously estimated at between Dollars 20bn to
Dollars 80bn.
Islamic banking is based on the explicit Quranic prohibition on riba
(interest). It, instead, puts emphasis on risk-sharing, by which the yield
on a transaction is calculated on a profit-and-loss basis, with the
institution which arranges the transaction taking an agreed management fee.
Islamic funding has gained increasing momentum in the 1990s, especially for
short-term trade credits, where the best instrument, the morabaha contract,
is now an internationally accepted mode of financing.
Morabaha is used to fund trade-related transactions on a cost-plus funding
basis. Under this structure, the Islamic financier purchases the export from
the supplier and sells it on to the importer, taking a profit (mark-up)
usually close to the prevailing cost of borrowing.
A market leader is the morabaha facility pioneered by the Faisal Islamic
Bank of Bahrain (FIBB), a subsidiary of the Geneva based Al Maal Al Islami
Trust (DMI), a leading Islamic financing group led by Prince Muhammed
Al-Faisal, son of the late King Faisal of Saudi Arabia. FIBB reports
arranging 22 morabaha syndications totalling Dollars 2.05bn in the last
decade, mainly for export and lease financing for Pakistani state
enterprises.
Islamic trade finance encompasses a growing range of products including
ijara, a leasing facility, project and equity finance, letters of credit,
shipping and other guarantees, virgin trade bills and instalment sales.
Moreover, istisna and salam are two types of forward contract for the sale
of goods where the price is paid in advance and the goods are delivered at a
future fixed date.
Although mainly still a short-term instrument, there is considerable
potential for Islamic financing to be used for larger contracts requiring
longer term financing. Islamic banks have provided two elements of the
Dollars 1.89bn Hub River power project, including a pioneering Dollars 92m
istisna facility, arranged by ANZ International Merchant Banking and
Al-Rajhi Banking and Investment Corporation (Arabic). In this operation, the
Saudi Arabian bank Arabic will buy purpose-built equipment from western
suppliers through advance payment and resell it to the project sponsor, Hub
River Power Company (Hubco), at a mark-up.
Islamic principles are slowly being integrated into Muslim countries'
trading regimes. Bank Negara, the Malaysian central bank, has pioneered a
bilateral payments system based on Islamic banking principles for trade with
developing countries such as Iran, and an export credit refinancing scheme.
The relevance of Islamic instruments for selling into the Muslim world is
illustrated by the increasingly active role taken by western institutions,
including Citibank International, Kleinwort Benson, ANZ Grindlays Bank and
Standard Chartered Bank.
Citibank arranged its first Islamic trade finance in Malaysia in the early
1980s. According to Atiq Ur Rebman, the bank's vice president for corporate
affairs, responsible for Islamic trade finance, in 1993 Citibank's London
office arranged mainly short term Islamic morabaha commodity trade finance
totalling Dollars 6bn. Kleinwort Benson and ANZ arranged similar
transactions, totalling Dollars 4bn and Dollars 400m respectively, also
through London.
Most of the financing arranged by western banks is for blue-chip European
and North American corporations, bankers say. Islamic investors place funds
with western banks to be invested under Islamic banking principles.
Specialist banks have developed their own in-house expertise to act as the
arranger matching the Islamic funds with potential users, and in some cases
have established segregated Islamic banking units.
The leading commercial Islamic groups include the Saudi Arabian-owned DMI,
Arabic and Shaikh Salah Kamel's Dallah Al Baraka group; Kuwait Finance House
and the Kuwait-based consortium The International Investor; Bank Islam
Malaysia Berhad (BIMB); and Dubai Islamic Bank. National markets are catered
for by Islamic institutions in countries such as Pakistan, Sudan, Iran and
Turkey. The Arab world's largest bank, National Commercial Bank of Saudi
Arabia is establishing a substantial Islamic operation.
Islamic banks are creating niche markets. Arabic's London office, for
example, is pioneering aircraft and tanker leasing using the ijara contract.
The International Investor, Al Baraka and others are developing equity
funds.
The largest Islamic trade and project finance institution is the
multilateral Islamic Development Bank (IDB), based in Jeddah but owned by
some 46 Islamic countries through equity subscriptions. The IDB has raised
its capital to over Dollars 6bn in anticipation of increased demand. It
already runs specialist trade finance schemes including the Islamic Banks'
Portfolio for Investments and Development, which provides financing with
commercial banks; the Longer Term Trade Financing Scheme, which emphasises
exports of non-traditional goods; and a trade-related Unit Investment Fund.
The IDB is now boosting its trade finance activity with a new subsidiary,
the Islamic Investment and Export Credits Guarantee Insurance Corporation.
This new institution has been advised by a London political risk specialist,
Investment Insurance International, part of the Bain Hogg Clarkson group.
Islamic institutions are also starting to feature in larger projects,
including those requiring multi-source financing, which combine financing
backed by export credit agencies, multilateral agencies and commercial
banks. Examples of this include the Dollars 92m istisna and Dollars 110m
morabaha facilities arranged for the multi-sourced Hub River power project.
Demand for Islamic trade finance is set to increase significantly over the
next few years as economic liberalisation measures finally take hold in a
number of Islamic countries. It could also flourish in high growth economies
such as Malaysia, Indonesia and the Gulf States. Islamic trade finance, says
Hussein Lawai, president of Pakistan's Muslim Commercial Bank (MCB), is
ideally suited to the competitive environment of the free market economy
with its free trade, open capital market and minimum government
intervention.
Malaysia is developing a dual banking system which could form a model for
systems elsewhere. This involves a conventional interest-based system and an
Islamic interest-free one operating side-by-side, but not interactively.
Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's finance minister, is encouraging local banks and
the branches of foreign banks to open 'Islamic Windows' to offer Islamic
products and to compete with BIMB and other Islamic institutions.

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (16): Experience and relationships are vital -
Winning contracts in Africa / In South Africa, UK exporters face intense
competition from German, Japanese, and US companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JON MARKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Longstanding social and business links between the UK and South Africa were
underlined during the visit of prime minister John Major to the republic in
September - see the regional focus, on the facing page.
'The strength of the relationship is a very important factor,' emphasises
Ian Robinson, chairman of the engineering division of Trafalgar House, who
was a member of Mr Major's mission.
Many of these links pre-date South Africa's emergence from apartheid and
sanctions. Trafalgar House subsidiary Davy International has been supplying
equipment to the region's metals processors for over two decades. It won an
order in early 1993 for some Pounds 200m worth of hot and cold rolling mills
to the Columbus stainless steel plant, 'where UK technology and UK finance
are pivotal,' says Mr Robinson.
Davy has since secured another contract for the supply of aluminium smelting
furnaces for the smaller Alusaf project for which the UK's Export Credits
Guarantees Department (ECGD) announced a Pounds 15m project supply line in
conjunction with Hill Samuel in April 1994.
Experience in the South African market and established links are still
critical factors - 'it's a conservative country,' says a banker active in
providing trade finance for South African buyers.
Other companies such as John Brown Engineering and Rolls Royce have enjoyed
a presence there for much of the last 30 years, with involvement in areas
such as offshore hydrocarbons development and sales of aerospace engines.
Over this period, trade has become increasingly linked to investment.
The Industrial Power Group of Rolls Royce operates a local subsidiary
company NEI South Africa to tap into the market for industrial power
products.
The transfer and application of new technology is now a prime feature of UK
export contracts to South Africa, says Chris Cox, the Department of Trade
and Industry's export promoter for South Africa. 'There has been a lack of
investment in machinery,' adds Mr Cox, who spent 13 years at Cable &amp;
Wireless (C&amp;W) before secondment to the DTI, and has lived much of his life
in southern Africa.
Bronx Process Engineering, a UK firm which is involved with the Columbus
project, has been selling to South Africa for 25 years. Mr Malcolm Roberts,
the company's managing director, says that relationships, developed over
many years, have formed the most crucial element in the company's success in
the region, though he also emphasises that it adopts a competitive pricing
strategy.
Bronx specialises in processing equipment for the steel and aluminium
industries. It was a nominated sub-contractor to the main Columbus
contractor Davy for a Pounds 14m sub-contracting deal. The contract involved
the refurbishment of old machinery and the delivery of new equipment -
currently being installed at Columbus - to prepare coils for the rolling
mills.
Long-term financing played a key part in negotiations for the Colombus deal,
says Mr Roberts - 'it was eventually done by Davy, through Kleinwort
Benson.'
Bronx has also won another South African contract, worth Pounds 5m, for
equipping Trident Steel, part of the large Anglovaal group.
The development of local infrastructure is a source of contracts, but
significant orders often call for a commitment to invest. East Midlands
Electricity (EME) has injected working capital of Pounds 200,000 into the
Phambili Nombane joint venture signed at the end of 1993 with South African
and French partners. The consortium expects to deliver electricity by 1996
to the township of Khayelitsha, 30 miles from Cape Town.
EME acts as the agent for its South African partner Eskom, which will meet
the costs of the project. EME is overseeing the construction, operation and
maintenance of the distribution system and provides customer services such
as meter reading and billing.
In a small, but growing, mobile telephone market, C&amp;W has taken a 25 per
cent stake in Mobile Telephone Network (MTN), which received a 15-year
operations licence in 1993. The network began operations in April in
Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town and Johannesburg, and is in competition with the
Vodacom network involving fellow UK concern Vodaphone. Part of the deal
involves installing pay-phones in townships, which then connect to the MTN
network to become static cellular phones. C&amp;W expects eventually to invest
around Pounds 25m in MTN, and has awarded a sub-contract to a UK company for
the supply of a digital access cross-control 'running into millions of
rands,' says C&amp;W.
Accompanying networks include communications software. Network Designers
(NDL) has a deal with Telkom, the South African state telecommunications
corporation. The order includes the supply of over 5,500 workstations and
was secured against tough local and international competition as NDL could
meet Telkom's requirements for 'connectionless' network implementation.
Software companies did well selling into the cellular market, observes Mr
Cox. Smaller exporters have also developed niche sales: Weybridge-based STT
Badalex was awarded a Pounds 3.5m contract in June by Consolidated Lamp
Manufacturers Pty (CLM) for the delivery of its specialised manufacturing
equipment for lamps. CLM, whose shareholders are GEC Alsthom, Barlow Rand
and Philips, will site the equipment in Port Elizabeth.
For all the region's potential, there are still substantial problems facing
exporters to South Africa. One, now being tackled by the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, is the question of high import tariffs. There is also
intense competition from German, Japanese, US and other exporters. While UK
companies have 'an inside track to some extent, they cannot rely on the
empathy factor,' says Chris Cox.
South Africa is a focus for UK official financial support for exporters.
Fifteen ECGD-backed credit lines are in place, including, for example, a
Pounds 30m line, funded by Kleinwort Benson.
By August this year, ECGD exposure to South Africa stood at Pounds 1.35bn
and UK government sources indicate that over Pounds 1bn in unused capacity
is still available. This makes South Africa the third most important market
in the world for ECGD, after China and Hong Kong.
The late September trade mission 'opened up some very significant industrial
contacts,' says Mr Robinson of Trafalgar House. Mr Michael Heseltine,
president of the Board of Trade, has hailed South Africa as the gateway to
the rest of the continent for UK investment and trade. Certainly in terms of
contract awards, it dominates. And in many cases, companies active in the
republic are also operating elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa: Davy
International, for example, is 'actively pursuing' business in Zimbabwe, C&amp;W
has a management deal in Botswana, Badalex recently landed its fifth
national contract in Nigeria. EME is active in Zanzibar and Zambia.

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (13): Fresh hope for Afro-optimists - Analysis /
Afro-optimists hope that a thriving post-apartheid South Africa will be the
engine of growth that will haul the ailing economies of the region out of
their protracted slump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of the optimism over the long-term trade prospects for South
Africa, Afro-pessimists point to the enormity of the challenge facing the
region. African countries' GDP growth last year (excluding South Africa) was
1.4 per cent, according to the 1994 World Bank annual report - better than
1992, but still well below the region's population growth rate.
Whatever the outcome, no one under-estimates South Africa's dominant role in
the economy of sub-Saharan Africa, strikingly illustrated by one yardstick:
export credit guarantees extended to Pretoria, since Nelson Mandela's
inauguration, exceed the total cover available to other countries in the
region.
Whether trade opportunities are indeed going to pick up north of the Limpopo
depends on which analysts you believe; and the analysts assessment may well
be influenced by what they wish to sell.
For brokers extolling the merits of the dozen or so investment funds which
have identified Africa as an emerging market whose time has come, prospects
seem almost rosy.
'Out of the starting blocks' reads the caption on the cover of a bullish
analysis of sub-Saharan stock markets published last month.*
Vast commodity reserves and low cost production, privatisation getting under
way, and the easing or lifting of foreign exchange controls are features
noted elsewhere in the report.
But before the exporter to Africa sends out a sales team, a distinctly more
cautious comment should be taken into account.
'Small markets with low growth rates, poor infrastructure, high
indebtedness, slow progress in introducing market and private sector
orientated economic reforms, and low levels of technological capabilities,
all reduce the attractiveness of many African countries to foreign
investors,' says the recent 1994 World Investment Report.**
Neither the stock market nor foreign investment level are in themselves
adequate guide to the state of the African market: as much as half of the
region's imports may be aid financed, and aid flows have been rising. But
the comments of the Investment Report may serve as a useful indicator, for
higher levels of foreign investment are essential to Africa's economic
recovery.
Despite the reforms that got under way in many African countries during the
1980s, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows did not increase between the
second half of the 1980s and early 1990s, notes the report.
Averaging around Dollars 3bn a year, FDI flows to the entire region were
considerably less than those received by Malaysia in the early 1990s, it
points out.
Inflows are concentrated in oil exporting countries, notably Egypt, Angola
and Nigeria. Although the total value of FDI flows into Africa nearly
doubled from an annual average of Dollars 1.7bn during 1981-85, to an
average of almost Dollars 3bn during 1986-90, says the study, those
investments were concentrated in few countries, and modest when compared to
FDI flows to other regions of the developing world.
Average annual FDI flows into Africa as a proportion of all inflows in
developing countries declined between these two periods from 13 per cent to
11 per cent.
Worse was to come. Flows stagnated in the early 1990s to many African
countries, while flows to other developing countries continued to increase.
'As a result, Africa's share decined further to 6 per cent by 1992, thus
underlining the marginalisation of that continent in relation to FDI, apart
from its marginalisation in relation to international trade.'
Africa's reforms may have got it out of the starting blocks, but it has
several laps to go, it seems, before it breasts the finishing tape.

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (14): New initiatives in South Africa - Regional
focus / A rapid expansion of trade links with other developing countries,
particularly in the rest of Africa and Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a glance through Johannesburg's leading business newspaper, Business Day,
demonstrates, South Africa's days as a trade pariah are well and truly over.
The pages are filled with news of new trade conferences, expos from all
manner of countries, and a steady stream of high level ministerial visits -
including two trips by America's Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown; visits
from both British prime minister John Major; and the president of the
British Board of Trade, Michael Heseltine - to try and boost international
trade links.
Reflecting the country's return to favour as a trading partner, there has
been a substantial rise in the number of international institutions willing
to provide trade finance for South African transactions and of governments
giving export credit guarantees.
Britain has been at the forefront of these new initiatives, and Mr Major
announced a trade guarantee package of over R1bn during his recent visit, a
move which makes South Africa one of the biggest markets for the UK's export
credit guarantee programme. However, other countries have also been
involved, with both Japan and the US announcing new packages and the
European Union agreeing to grant South Africa GSP status from next January
(although some key goods such as processed fruit and paper products will not
be covered under the agreement following French pressure). And given South
Africa's excellent payments record, the risks are relatively small.
Another particularly interesting development is the rapid expansion of trade
links with other developing countries, particularly in the rest of Africa
and Asia. Trade delegations have been arriving from places as diverse as
Nigeria, Malaysia, Taiwan and India.
As a result, trade with these countries has been growing very rapidly over
the past 12 months, albeit off a very low base, and businessmen on both
sides are confident that these links will continue to expand.
The new interest has been clearly signalled in South Africa's trade figures
for the year, and its import bill has been soaring. In the first six months
of the year, merchandise imports rose 21 per cent from 1993's levels and in
August alone, they rocketed up by 20.8 per cent to a high of R8.07bn for the
month.
Also contributing to the surge is the desperate need by South African
companies to modernise plant and equipment. After having let fixed
investment decline to dangerously low levels during the crippling four-year
recession that ended last year, many companies are now embarking on
long-delayed capital spending, and machinery has accounted for nearly half
of all imports.
Given that South Africa has a notoriously high propensity to import during
times of economic growth, this move may soon send the trade account into
deficit.
Indeed, the IBCA, the European ratings agency that recently gave South
Africa a sub-investment grade rating of BB, cited this is one of the
problems with the South African economy. Such an event is made even more
likely by the government's declared commitment to start lowering import
tariffs in line with the Gatt agreement, a process that began in July with
the announcement that duties on motor cars would be reduced. However,
despite this, South Africa continues to run a trade surplus, expected to be
around R10bn on the year, and although import growth has far outstripped the
rise in exports, the country's businessmen are confident that the tide will
soon start to turn.
South Africa's remains overwhelmingly dependent on mineral exports,
particularly gold, but given the fact that the commodity cycle appears to
have bottomed out and in light of the continued depreciation of the Rand,
the mining industry is expecting a good year in 1995.
The government's decision to start restructuring GEIS, South Africa's
controversial R2bn a year export incentive scheme, which subsidises
companies involved in manufacturing exports, may cause a short-term drop as
companies are forced to cope with reduced government aid. UK contracts in
Africa: see Jon Marks report on the facing page.

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (12): Fraud is all too easy - False
documentation / Abuses of the documentary credit system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL ROWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Documentary credits are well-established as a way of making payment for
export sales, yet fraudsters still successfully swindle sellers, buyers and
banks. Because of the difficulties in stopping or recovering international
letters of credit (l/c) payments, early preventive steps - before deals are
concluded - will provide the only effective safeguard.
Under the documentary credit system, the importer's bank gives an
irrevocable undertaking to pay the exporter against presentation of shipping
documents. Provided the documents appear correct, the bank is obliged to
hand over the money and its customer has to reimburse it.
This can sometimes result in unscrupulous sellers obtaining full payment for
non-existent or sub-standard goods, and the buyer has to foot the bill.
Conversely, the banks can refuse payment, even though the goods are perfect
and comply with the export agreement, if only one of the documents does not
comply exactly with the letter of credit terms. Examples could be the
absence of an 'on-board' notation on a bill of lading specified in the
credit, or the issuance of an inspection certificate by a company other than
the one named in the letter of credit.
In cases such as this, a dishonest buyer may be able to obtain possession of
the goods and either resist payment altogether or hold out for an
unjustifiable price reduction.
According to the UK-based ICC Commercial Crime Bureau - a specialised
division of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris - one such scam,
involving phoney sugar export deals in Central and South America, is
affecting businesses around the globe.
'Some cargoes being offered to buyers worldwide are often described as
'floating cargo'or 'outside quota' and at a significantly lower price than
the current market price. Buyers are required to present an ICPO
(Irrevocable Corporate Purchase Order) and put up a substantial amount of
guarantee,' says the bureau.
'On each occasion, enquiries . . .have found that the cargoes do not exist
and the proposed transactions are an attempt to defraud inexperienced buyers
and/or their banks. In some cases, money-laundering is also suspected,' the
bureau warns.
In other instances, fraudulent buyers - mainly in Nigeria - trick exporters
into shipping goods to them by forging worthless documentary credits. The
criminals usually request that goods be shipped by air freight; and, in some
instances, fraudulent bank drafts are also presented.
When the exporting company tries to claim payment, it discovers that the
bank which is said to have issued the l/c or the draft, knows nothing about
the transaction. Therefore, suppliers should contact their banks to check
the authenticity of documents before releasing goods, but exporters are
sometimes reluctant to do this for fear of losing what seems to be a genuine
order.
Exporters are also losing money through frauds on documentary collection
operations. Under this procedure, the seller presents the shipping
documentation to the importer through the banking system, and the bank in
the buyer's country releases the documents to the importer against payment.
The buyer needs to have these documents in order to obtain possession of the
goods. However, in some instances, dishonest buyers are able to obtain
delivery of the goods without payment by presenting forged documents to the
carrier or warehouse.
Mr Lin Kuo, assistant director of the ICC Commercial Crime Bureau, suggests
that companies can considerably diminish the fraud risk by applying a simple
four-part check list:
Know your customer as well as you would know your enemy. Companies should be
satisfied with the standing and integrity of the customer they are dealing
with before entering into any binding agreement. The customer's competitors
can often be the best source of information in this respect.
Never rely one hundred per cent on documents presented to you. The golden
rule is check, check and check again.
Remember, 'you never get anything for nothing,' and if the deal is 'too good
to be true,' it probably is, says the bureau.
In addition to informing yourself fully on the risks of frauds and
precautions that can be taken, make sure that your employees are also fully
informed and aware in these respects.
The agreement to effect payment on letter of credit terms is made between
buyer and seller when they strike their export deal. The importer then
instructs its bank to issue the appropriate documentary credit. Normally,
this is notified to the exporting firm through a bank in the exporter's own
country.
The exporter may do little more than glance at the incoming letter of credit
to ensure that the amount is right, and then file it away until the time
arrives to claim payment. However, if it subsequently discovered that the
seller's documents do not comply strictly with the credit terms, it is too
late to put matters right.
An importer who suspects that he may have been defrauded after the credit
has been issued and the goods have been shipped, usually stands little
chance of stopping the bank from paying. This is because courts in most
countries have held that bankers' irrevocable payment undertakings are
essential to the conduct of international trade, and should hardly ever be
interfered with.
In most instances, the buyer will be left with no remedy other than to sue
the seller for return of the money.

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (10): Tough restrictions in the UK -
Cross-border leasing / A classic cross-border leasing deal involves an
exporter selling equipment to a leasing company, which, in turn, structures
a leasing arrangement with the foreign customer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The wide range of financial and other support mechanisms in place for UK
exporters has one demonstrable absentee - the availability of mainstream
crossborder leasing services to fund and facilitate the sale of,
particularly, capital goods equipment.
This has been the case since the early 1980s when tough legislation, aimed
at curbing abuses resulting in tax revenue losses, killed off conventional
cross-border leasing of UK exports by establishing rules which made the
practice unattractive to leasing companies. However, attempts to change the
law relating to cross-border leasing are continuing; the main lobbying body
is the London-based Finance and Leasing Association (FLA) which groups
together a range of finance houses, including representatives from UK
clearing and merchant banks.
Additionally, despite the current prohibitive UK tax regime, some leasing
company executives maintain that exporters should not ignore the leasing
option. In certain circumstances it may be viable, depending on a range of
factors such as the value of the equipment and whether repeat orders are
involved.
Also, some asset finance companies may be prepared to assist UK exporters by
operating through foreign subsidiaries where they can access more favourable
tax regimes.
Cross-border leases can vary: operating leases generate income from the
assets involved; full-payout leases are aimed at the leasing company
receiving back the value of product, plus a target profit, during the life
of the lease - with the lessee purchasing the equipment thereafter (or
continuing the arrangement at a more or less nominal fee).
'Such leases have not featured much in the UK exporter's lexicon of trade
finance terminology for a long time,' says Barry Sutton of London-based
lease structuring experts New Boston Partners, which are partly owned by the
Bank of Tokyo.
The fundamental unattractiveness of UK cross-border leasing operations to
leasing companies lies in the fact that only 10 per cent Writing Down
Allowances (WDAs) are available - and there are considerable restrictions on
how and where these apply.
This means that a leasing company, when allowed, can only write off 10 per
cent of the cost of purchasing equipment annually. This compares with 25 per
cent on domestic UK leases and a range of more favourable tax regimes in
most of UK exporters' competitor countries, particularly in Europe.
UK exporters lack a leasing option, unlike their counterparts in most other
countries in Europe, says Mr Sutton.
Where available, lease-based exporting can be attractive with the leasing
company, providing the exporter with secure funds up-front, thus removing
payment worries and possible concerns, such as the cost and administration
of export credit agency insurance.
According to the FLA, in 1981 - the year before current tax treatment was
introduced - FLA members wrote new leases for foreign customers amounting to
around Pounds 600m and provided a significant source of support for UK
exports, especially in the capital equipment sector.
At today's prices, the 1981 figure would exceed Pounds 1bn with, according
to FLA estimates, the value of leases involving UK exports probably
amounting to around Pounds 700m.
However, the continued absence of such funding for export sales reflects
concern within the Inland Revenue that a relaxation of the tax law relating
to cross-border leasing could re-generate a spate of export leasing-based
tax abuses triggering significant loss of revenue.
A common abuse involved foreign companies claiming capital allowances for
purchases of non-UK origin equipment.
There seems little prospect that the 10 per cent WDAs will be raised in the
near future, but, according to Mr Andy Thompson, secretary of the FLA, some
liberalisation of the conditions which allow leases to qualify for WDAs may
eventually emerge.
Currently, for example, qualifying leases cannot be written for longer than
13 years and payments must be evenly spread. The FLA would like to see
longer qualifying lease terms and greater payments flexibility.
In addition to the FLA, the British Exporters Association (Bexa), a lobby
group which brings together both bankers and manufacturers, says it is
unhappy that cross-border leasing remains effectively unavailable to
exporters.
The association is especially concerned that, in some situations, foreign
companies against which UK exporters are bidding may gain competitive
advantage by having the lease finance option available to back sales.
'We are closely monitoring the situation, possibly with a view to taking it
up with government,' says Bexa chairman Mr Keith Johnson.
Bexa has strongly lobbied government in recent years in a bid to improve the
level of government support for exporters. It played a key role, for
example, in pressing the government to boost export credit insurance
facilities.
'We are interested in hearing from any British exporters who feel they are
losing out by not having the export lease finance option available,' says Mr
Johnson.
Meanwhile, regardless of future legal developments, exporters exploring a
range of funding options may find a leasing company which could be prepared
to handle lease based exports.
NatWest Leasing and Asset Finance is amongst a cluster of finance houses
prepared, in certain circumstances, to handle 'big ticket' business of
around Pounds 10m or more involving such exports as aircraft, railway
rolling stock and large plant - a key attraction being the level of
financial flows involved.

These rates are published monthly, normally around the middle of each
month. A premium of 0.2 per cent is to be added to the credit rates
when fixing at bid.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Interest rates may not be fixed for longer than 120 days. SDR-based
rates of interest are the same for all currencies.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
For the period from July 15, 1994, through to January 14, 1995, the
SDR-base rate will be 7.35 per cent. It replaces the previous rate of
5.95 per cent. It will again be subject to change on January 15, 1995.
The SDR-based rate is derived from the weighted average of the yields
of government or public sector bonds of France, Germany, Japan, the UK
and US.

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (9): Letters of credit: risks and rewards -
Credit watch / Jon Marks and Kevin Godier highlight the financial and
commercial risks of doing business in a range of key markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Algeria, traditionally a big market for letter of credit financing, has
found obtaining confirmations extremely difficult in the past two years. An
agreement to reschedule its official debt with the Paris Club of creditor
governments and the implementation of an economic stabilisation and
refinancing package with the IMF and World Bank has eased the situation.
However, the country's political crisis and commercial banks' attempts to
reduce their Algerian exposure means that many exporters will continue to
experience severe problems obtaining letters of credit (l/cs).
Turkey's foreign exchange crisis of early 1994 shook business confidence.
The situation has improved since and, in July, Standard &amp; Poor's, the US
ratings agency, removed Turkey from its critical credit-watch list. But
relatively few banks are prepared to take on fresh Turkish risk and many
have closed existing credit lines.
Specialist trade financiers such as forfaiters (who buy an exporters' debt
at a discount, providing cash up-front to reduce the seller's risk to zero)
have been moving out of Turkey, which has been deemed to be no longer a good
risk for repayments.
Securing Turkish l/cs may also prove problematic and often depends on the
strength of the relationships between importers' and exporters' confirming
banks. Letters of credit cover more than 40 per cent of Turkish
transactions, with around 20 per cent of deals transacted on open account
terms.
Brazil and Argentina. Trade flows into Latin America are rising sharply, as
economies in the region continue their expansion. Increased use of export
credit agency services offers one option for capital goods exporters.
Standard letters of credit were the basic instrument when the payments
situation was less certain.
Methods available for capital equipment financing range from collateralised
pre-payment, through sight l/cs (payable at sight) to medium- and long-term
finance provided by commercial banks.
Thus, Barclays de Zoete Wedd (BZW) has signed a five-year facility worth
Dollars 38.25m for the Brazilian navy to finance goods supplied by UK
defence contractors in one of the first medium-term loans from a prime
lending institution since Brazil's Brady plan debt restructuring.
Clients in the region borrowing on a short-term basis generally receive
terms of 90-180 days, although 360-day structures are available for larger
deals.
Medium-term borrowing is usually on terms of between two and five years, and
in the fast expanding market for infrastructure equipment terms as long as
ten years have been quoted.
Lloyds Bank of the UK , reports that it has credit lines in place worth over
Dollars 1bn for Brazil alone, which continues to enjoy strong demand for
commodities. The bank is 'usually looking to take on more Brazilian
capacity,' according to Simon Sayer, assistant director in Lloyds' project
and trade finance group. Mr Sayer sees a trend away from l/c financed
trading - 'less than one half of our Brazilian deals is now done through
letters of credit,' he says.
Mr Sayer stresses the benefits of this trend given the expense to the
exporter of raising an l/c, the maturity of which can be considerably longer
than the duration of the actual deal, as with many commodity transactions.
An alternative, which is especially useful for clients purchasing
medium-sized capital equipment, involves the discounting of the paper debt -
a procedure akin to factoring or forfaiting.
In this case risk calculations are often based on the bank's confidence in
known buyers, where default risk is at a minimum.
Uruguay has promoted itself as a regional finance centre, and there is added
availability of trade credits through Montevideo's offshore financial
institutions. However, the maturities on Uruguayan payments remain broadly
in line with those of Argentina and Brazil.
London banks report a steady demand for UK equipment in the Uruguayan market
which is satisfied by a mix of letters of credit deals and avalised drafts.
Paraguay: In less attractive markets such as Paraguay, very short-term trade
finance remains the norm and is largely linked to the predominantly
agricultural economy, involving tractors and other farm equipment.
Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador: Much short-term financing involves deals of
around Dollars 5,000-Dollars 10,000, bankers report, with only financiers
very specialised in such markets offering l/cs on terms of up to 180 days.
But for these countries' limited number of blue chip borrowers and for
larger structured projects, medium-term financing may be available.
The following are among other recent trends noted by specialist trade
financiers:
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are building new banking and commercial
relations, but sight l/cs and other very short-term instruments still
dominate. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is
considering plans for a new trade finance facility for the Baltic states,
which would follow its ground-breaking deal for Macedonia.
Kazakhstan is gradually developing as the focus for trade finance activity
in Central Asia due to its potential to generate revenues for exports of oil
and other natural resources. Forfaiters, including Hungarian International
Bank, report some activity. But lack of capacity is a severe problem in a
market where buyers are seeking financing for contracts potentially worth
tens of millions of dollars.
A short-term market in l/cs of up to 180 days is emerging in Kazakhstan.
Business focuses on the multinationals setting up in Almaty with an eye to
the opportunities on offer now and especially when the legislative and
operating environment in Kazakhstan becomes clearer. (See also the case
study on page 24 of this issue of the FT Exporter).
Pakistan is increasingly using the morabaha (cost-plus financing) Islamic
financing instrument. Specialists, such as the Bahrain-based Faisal Islamic
Bank are arranging a steady flow of morabaha syndications for Pakistani
enterprises.
Western banks, including ANZ Grindlays Bank and Kleinwort Benson, are also
becoming established in the Islamic market for short-term transactions.
Analysts say that as the use of Islamic instruments matures they will
increasingly be used for larger and more long-term trade transactions.

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (8): The pace of investment quickens - Britain
in China / For all the voices of doom about the effects of the Hong Kong
row, China's huge infrastructure demands are likely to create big
opportunities for UK companies. There are already 600 British-invested joint
ventures in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir Michael Palliser, president of the China-Britain Trade Group, is
optimistic about prospects for British trade and investment in China in
spite of lingering problems over Hong Kong.
Senior Chinese officials had indicated, he said, a wish to separate politics
from business in this testing phase leading up to China's resumption of
sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997.
Judging by the latest figures which reveal buoyant two-way trade and strong
British investment growth, the vexed Hong Kong issue has not as yet made a
big impact on Sino-British business, but UK companies remain wary about
possible fallout.
Sir Michael, who led a high-level British trade delegation to China in
mid-September, said Chinese officials including vice premier Li Lanqing, had
gone out of their way to stress the importance of the business relationship,
and this augured well for Sino-British trade.
'Whatever the political difficulties it is important to continue to do
business with China which is developing at a formidable rate. Of course, it
would be desirable if political relations between the two countries were
easier but in terms of doing business we don't see great problems,' Sir
Michael told reporters in Beijing.
In the first six months of this year, Britain's exports to China grew by
17.3 per cent to Pounds 420.2m compared with the corresponding period last
year, while imports rose by 37.9 per cent to Pounds 781.9m (Dollars 1,211m),
(see the table of statistics on this page). Among European Community
countries Britain ranks fourth in exports to China behind Germany, France
and Italy.
But in investment, UK companies lead the pack, according to figures supplied
by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec). These
show that, cumulatively, British-pledged (as opposed to actual utilised)
investment in China between 1979-1993 reached Dollars 3bn, more than double
that of Germany, its nearest competitor.
In utilised investment, however, it ranked just behind France. Britain's
actual investment in China had reached Dollars 578m by the end of 1993
compared with Dollars 602m for France. Britain's pledged investment of
Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) placed it in sixth place on the table of top ten
investors in China behind Hong Kong, Taiwan, the US, Japan and Singapore.
British trade officials in Beijing say the official figures almost certainly
under-state Britain's involvement since a portion of Hong Kong's investment
on the mainland is of UK origin. At this sensitive moment in Sino-UK
relations, many British companies wish to remain in the background.
But there is no doubt that as far as investment is concerned, the pace is
quickening. Figures show that last year alone, Dollars 1.99bn of UK
investment was pledged, more than twice the figure for the previous decade.
This squares with anecdotal impressions indicating that the scale of British
investment is increasing with greater emphasis these days on larger projects
as companies such as Pilkington and ICI become more confident about the
Chinese business environment.
China's huge infrastructure demands will almost certainly create big
opportunities for British companies such as GEC which is negotiating equity
involvement in a power plant in Zhejiang province south of Shanghai, under a
build-operate-transfer (BOT) scheme.
For all the voices of doom about the effects of the Hong Kong row, Britain's
business presence on the ground is fairly impressive. Among 600
British-invested joint ventures are some of the UK's most prominent
companies, including BP and Shell, Rolls Royce, Glaxo and SmithKline
Beecham, Zeneca, Coats Viyella, Allied Lyons, Cadbury Schweppes and BTR, to
name just a few.
Service organisations such as banks, securities houses, insurance companies,
advertising agencies, legal and accountants firms are also proving to be
extremely active. Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Standard
Chartered are extending their reach; National Westminster recently
established a presence in Shanghai; Jardine Fleming and Barings are among
the more prominent foreign brokers; Saatchi and Saatchi has several offices
in China; Sedgwicks was recently granted a broking licence; and Coopers &amp;
Lybrand has ambitious plans for a network of partnerships with local
accounting firms.
Indeed, it is the services sector that may well provide the greatest scope
for increased British involvement. With China's huge appetite for capital,
it would be surprising if the Chinese did not turn increasingly to the
London Stock Exchange and City of London institutions for financial
assistance and advice.
But industry is also laying what appears to be a solid foundation for
expansion. BP, for example, concluded an agreement in May this year for a 51
per cent stake in a UDollars 100m acetic acid plant in Chongqing, Sichuan
province; Coats Viyella has invested some UDollars 100m in a web of mills,
mostly concentrated near Tianjin, east of Beijing; Unilever, through its
Walls ice-cream group has outlayed UDollars 50m to establish a factory and
distribution network in Beijing; BTR is investing about UDollars 90 in a
bottling plant near Guangzhou in southern China; Pilkington which was
involved in the establishment of a float glass project in Shanghai in 1983,
is engaged in three other projects.
Companies such as Rolls Royce, which have been exporting to China for many
years, are also doing well. The UK company recently won a big order to
supply 42 of its RB211-535 jet engines for Boeing 757's bought by Chinese
airlines. Rolls Royce says it is confident of winning further orders.
But as the China market continues to open, so does competition become more
intense, with the Americans staking a claim for a bigger share. The recent
high profile visit to Beijing of Mr Ron Brown, the US Commerce Secretary, at
the head of a delegation of 24 chief executive officers of leading American
companies is just one indication of an intensifying US focus on China.
As Sir Michael Palliser of the CBTG says: 'Our main worry is not competition
from other Europeans, but from the thundering herd of Americans coming in.'
On a general economic front, China is redoubling its efforts to contain
inflation with a new campaign to curb rises in the prices of grain, cotton
and chemical fertiliser.
New figures from China's State Statistical Bureau show that consumer prices
in 35 main cities rose 27.1 per cent during the year to August, compared
with 24.2 during the year to July. The July-to-August inflationary surge
prompted an announcement by a worried leadership that fighting inflation
would be the government's main priority for the rest of this year.

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (7): Optimism in the longer-term - International
retailers target Russia - Fashionwear retailers from Britain, Germany and
Scandinavia have ambitious plans for new outlets in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROD MCNEIL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International retailers are increasingly seeking to carve out a significant
market niche in Russia, a country short on quality retail outlets.
In Moscow and larger cities, entrepreneurship is thriving and shops are
beginning to transform themselves from mere distribution points to much more
attractive sales venues.
Stockmann, Finland's premier retail group, experienced a jump in retail
sales in Russia from less than Dollars 10m in its first year of operation in
1989 to an estimated Dollars 65m this year.
Sales in the six months to end-June surged by more than 60 per cent, helped
by the opening of a new clothing store in Moscow in December 1993, and the
summer 1993 opening of a grocery store in St Petersburg. Less than 5 per
cent of all products sold are locally sourced, providing important
opportunities for foreign product suppliers. According to Ilkka Arvola,
director in charge of international operations at Stockmann, sales per
square foot are currently almost double those in Finland, and shrinkage of 2
per cent is comparable to Finnish operations. Profits, he claims are 'very
satisfactory,' in spite of a tendency towards higher taxes and customs
duties.
The company plans to open a full scale department store in St Petersburg in
1996, and later in Moscow, but Stockmann is still searching for an
appropriate location.
Meanwhile, Littlewoods, the international retail and leisure conglomerate,
doubled the trading space of its first two stores - opened in St Petersburg
in 1991 - last year and now has five stores in Russia, with annual sales of
around Dollars 10m.
Basic fashion commodities sell particularly well and the company plans to
expand the range of products on offer. Malcolm Landau, director of European
retailing and wholesaling at Littlewoods, says: 'In overall terms, sales and
gross contribution per square foot are substantially better than in the UK.
There is also much more rapid stock turnover and lower stock levels.'
Landau adds that the product mix is increasingly moving towards
locally-sourced merchandise.
Significantly, the operating environment, though difficult, is improving -
'the most important change is the improving economic situation. Also, an
increasing percentage of the population has a disposable income.
'I believe the long-term retailing opportunities are extremely good; the
short- term outlook, however, must remain mixed as it is very difficult to
predict the immediate economic and political situation.' Littlewoods
eventual aim is larger stores, concentrating on the bigger urban
conurbations - 'we hope to launch a full-scale chain store, probably in St
Petersburg, during the next fifteen to eighteen months, if not sooner.'
Karstadt, the German department store operator, has chosen a a different
path, supplying internationally-sourced products to four niche stores -
European-style fashion wear, children's clothes and toys, optics and sports
gear and equipment - located within Moscow's long-established Gum department
store.
The stores, totalling around 2,000 square metres, are run and operated by
Gum, but Karstadt provides know-how and financial assistance for store
layout, decoration and general merchandising skills. To date, Karstadt has
invested some DM3m in upgrading the four Gum-run stores.
Peter Lang, finance director of Karstadt, observes: 'Sales last year
totalled around DM30m. There has been a small increase in the first seven
months of this year compared with the same period last year, with textiles
and fashion goods generating the largest share.'
The company, he adds, is happy in principle with the venture, but there are
no immediate plans to expand the pilot venture.

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (6): Consumer revolution grips Russia - A rocky
road to capitalism / Many of the world's biggest multinationals are rapidly
developing their presence in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
For the past 70 years, Russia has been a land without shopkeepers. In the
Soviet economy, the retail trade almost ranked as an afterthought as
industry manufactured products, according to the central economic plans, and
pushed them through to the consumer irrespective of demand. There was little
need to advertise; no need to woo the customer.
But as Russia starts the rocky road to capitalism, a great consumer
revolution is under way. The process is most visible at the top of the
market as status-conscious Russians snap up western trinkets. Posh
boutiques, such as Christian Dior and Escada, now brighten up Russia's
shopping arcades. The best-dressed clients of fashionable restaurants are no
longer foreigners but the new generation of Russian businesmyeni. Stretch
limousines cruise Moscow's streets.
The mass market is changing just as fast. Following a high-profile
advertising campaign for Snickers chocolate bars, Russians joked that the
country has now entered a third phase of economic development. First came
industrialisation, then 'collectivisation,' and finally 'snickersisation' as
150m Russians satisfy their craving for consumer goods.
Thousands of kiosks, stocking Marlboro cigarettes and Absolut vodka, have
mushroomed on street corners. The country's bold privatisation programme,
which effectively transferred thousands of shops to their employees, is
stimulating real competition between Russia's retailers. The more energetic
entrepreneurs are flourishing while the less aggressive are going to the
wall.
In such a fast-changing business climate, it is not easy for western
companies to exploit the pent-up demand. Several retailers, such as
Benetton, Panasonic, Julius Meinl and Galeries Lafayette, have opened
stores. Littlewoods, the Liverpool-based retailer which started trading in
St Petersburg in 1991, has also been one of the most adventurous companies
to enter the market. Littlewoods has opened five clothing and food stores
and is developing trading links with a large local clothing manufacturer
with a view to exporting Russian-made goods. It says its stores are trading
successfully and will continue to invest substantial resources.
But as a private company, Littlewoods can afford to adopt a longer time
horizon than most. A thicket of bureaucratic complications, the
ever-changing legal framework and the fast-growing pandemic of crime has
made life difficult for the other pioneers. The political and economic risks
remain high. No-one has yet produced accurate enough market research for
consumer spending patterns to lend much confidence. Most leading western
retailers are maintaining a watching brief on the market waiting for it to
mature.
That has left western exporters with a problem. There are extremely few
dependable western-style outlets through which they can sell their goods.
That means dealing with Russian operators, who are inevitably inexperienced
and often unreliable, or setting up their own distribution networks, which
requires a big commitment.
Nevertheless, many of the world's biggest multinationals, such as Philip
Morris, Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever, Mars, and RJR Nabisco, are rapidly
developing their presence in Russia. The simplest approach for fast-moving
consumer goods manufacturers is to stimulate the 'pull' side of the
marketing equation by making their goods available and making consumers want
to buy them through advertising, which remains cheap by world standards,
despite sharp price rises.
For example, Cadbury Schweppes, the UK chocolate and drinks manufacturer,
has adopted just such an approach for its Wispas and Picnic bars and
recently reported it was achieving annual exports approaching Pounds 10m.
The US multinational, RJR Nabisco, has also targeted Russia as a
fast-growing market and opened a secure warehouse in Moscow to supply its
products, including Planters' peanuts.
'We started out small and conservative and we did not have an advertising
blitz. We picked a few stores we wanted to be in - mainly the hard currency
stores - and used it as our test market. That went well and then we started
to sell for roubles to Russian distributors,' says Mr Ruben Ter-Minasyan, a
Moscow sales representative for RJR Nabisco.
Nabisco advertises mainly through in-store promotions building up
relationships on a store by store basis. The company also employs a large
dummy Mr Peanut who tours around Moscow handing out free samples. Nabisco
relies on Russian distributors to sell its goods in the big cities and says
they are learning fast as the market develops.
'We are trying to work with the companies which like to work and want to
work. The wholesalers could make astronomical profits one or two years ago
of 50 per cent or even 100 per cent, but it is real work now. The margin is
going down as the turnover is going up. Our wholesalers make 10 to 15 per
cent margins and the retailers make the same margins, too,' says Mr
Ter-Minasyan.
At present, the balance of risk and reward is still unfavourably tilted
against western investors, but that is rapidly changing. And while China's
startling economic growth has obsessed western executives, it would be
foolish to ignore Russia's potential. The country's painful economic
stabilisation programme is at last paying some dividends, the sharp
contraction of industrial production is slowing down, and the service sector
is growing at a phenomenal rate. Those executives who laughed at talk of a
Russian economic 'miracle' are feeling a little less comfortable today.

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (5): Rich potential in Latin America - Growth
markets / Deregulation and an unprecedented opening to cross-border trade
are having a profound effect on increasingly sophisticated markets in the
region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JON MARKS and KEVIN GODIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARKET FOCUS: Here, and on the following eight pages, FT corrspondents
report on export opportunities to Latin America, China, Russia and Africa.
The opening to international capital, tariff reductions and
anti-protectionist measures have stimulated an upturn in trade in Latin
America. In response to rapid change, exporters into the region are making
investments in manufacturing plants and other facilities to secure their
place in increasingly sophisticated markets.
'We wouldn't see any stumbling blocks at all to operating out of the region.
They are pretty accommodating in Latin America, but ten years ago it was a
different story: US companies then were mainly concentrating on Europe,'
says Jason Wright, a senior vice-president of US food group RJR Nabisco.
The group had been established in Latin America for well over a decade,
selling into markets as diverse as Colombia, Peru, Costa Rica, Brazil and
Mexico when last April it purchased a 70 per cent stake in Argentinian
biscuit-maker EM Terrabusi.
Buying into a manufacturer with market capitalisation of Dollars 280m
'expanded our scope from a smaller business we were involved in there,' says
Mr Wright. Many other companies have decided to make investments which allow
them to export to a target market from within its borders.
Procter &amp; Gamble's (P&amp;G's) acquisition of Argentinian food giant Bunge y
Born's 78 per cent stake in Compania Quimica, which makes detergents, for
Dollars 52.5m, formed part of a strategy to establish the company's regional
penetration.
P&amp;G was already operating in Venezuela - where it has a regional
headquarters - Chile, Peru and Brazil, as well as Argentina, where in 1991
it established a 50:50 joint venture with a local company, Equimal,
producing disposable nappies and other sanitary products.
'What we have done in a number of these countries is to look for access to
product categories where our market share is negligible or non-existent,'
says Bill Dobson, P&amp;G's director of international public affairs. P&amp;G seeks
out strong, established brands.
'We look for companies with a strong operating base, regional sales and a
strong manufacturing capacity,' Mr Dobson says. 'We look to start from a
place other than zero.'
The size of the Argentinian consumer market has encouraged others to invest.
The UK's Cadbury Schweppes bought 80 per cent of the equity of a
privately-owned confectionary company, Productos Stani, to gain a foothold
in the region where, according to Cadbury Schweppes, confectionery
production in Argentina alone amounts to around 130,000 tonnes annually.
The size of Brazil's domestic market is a crucial factor behind many
decisions to invest heavily in the country, despite the fact that, as Mr Ron
Brown, the US Commerce Secretary said during a business mission in July, it
'is still a relatively closed market.'
Brazil has, however, opened up its market over the past four years. Imports
increased by 18.2 per cent in the first quarter of 1994 on a year-on-year
basis, including increases in consumer durables of 71.9 per cent and capital
goods of 29.7 per cent.
Investors in Brazil include the UK's Pilkington Group, which plans a Dollars
100m float glass plant, based on the potential offered by 150m potential
consumers and growth in industrial production.
Selling into a large domestic market provides the impetus to establish
investment-led operations. These may then service smaller neighbouring
markets. P&amp;G sells into Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay and Ecuador from
Argentina and Brazil.
The Ford motor company's Venezuelan affiliate sells some assembled products
into the Ecuadorian and Colombian markets, benefitting from reciprocal
tariff agreements.
Cross-border business is being made easier by regional trade pacts.
Multinationals, including Du Pont and Dow Chemicals, chose Colombia as a
regional base partly because of its potential to service other Andean Pact
countries. Cadbury was partly attracted to Argentinian confectioner Stani
because of its developing export business in the Mercosur region.
'The economies in Latin America are now opening, but this is a very recent
phenomenon and not yet fully established,' says Theo Carnier, Dow's director
of communications for Brazil.
In this process, trade pacts 'helped us a lot,' he says, and in November
1993 Dow transferred its regional office from Mexico to Sao Paolo 'to be
near our markets.'
Among the leading pacts are the following:
Mercosur, forming a market worth Dollars 600bn a year, serving 190m people
in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Internal trade has more than
doubled since the agreement was signed in 1991.
The Andean Pact, comprising Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and Peru,
has also agreed to a common external tariff to be implemented from 1995
within its area of around 100m people. Trade among members grew by around 30
per cent in 1993.
The Group Of Three, signed on 14 June by Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico.
Colombia and Venezuela will reduce their duties on Mexican imports by an
average of 21 per cent on 1 January 1995, while Mexico will cut its tariffs
by 32 per cent. Some degree of protection remains built in, with, for
example, a 13-year transition period for the automotive industry.
The North American Free Trade Agreement, linking the US, Canada and Mexico
is attracting manufacturers south of the Rio Grande.
There is still much to be set in place before companies can invest in the
knowledge they are working in a European-type single market. Bureaucracy can
remain byzantine across the region. Transport links are often primitive.
Not all emerging markets have shown great enthusiasm for multilateral trade
accords, including the star performer among economic reformers, Chile.
Chile has fought shy of regional groupings, while developing a network of
bilateral trade agreements and encouraging investment by promoting its
strong commitment to free market principles.
The movement of foreign capital into Latin American markets seems
irreversible, although there are contraints. Latin America has been a growth
market for the Ford motor company, for example, but 'it has nothing like the
dimensions attached to Asia,' says Mr Ken Brown, Ford's public affairs
manager for the region.
For smaller companies, focusing on national markets will remain imperative.
But for even the smallest exporters, markets are changing and a regional
market is emerging in which ease of access to cross-border trade, as well as
the scale of the main domestic market, are becoming critical factors.

remains

HARMONISATION: Exporters welcome the more liberal trading environment, but
slow progress is being made on harmonising key commercial areas
Businesses in all 12 of the European Union's member-states are enthusiastic
about the benefits that have stemmed from the dismantling of internal
frontiers and the abandonment of customs controls. They report that delivery
times have been cut sharply with delays at customs posts no longer part of a
lorry driver's daily existence. Across the Union, exporters are taking
advantage of the more liberal trading environment brought on by the 1992
initiative to ease trade moves into neighbouring markets.
Nevertheless, much remains to be done. Recently, in a bid to speed up the
single market's completion, the European Commission took a close look at
those member-states that had been slow to adopt all the harmonisation
legislation crucial for the free flow of goods, services and capital within
the market's frontiers.
Tables produced by the commission showed which member-states were helping to
hinder progress. Germany, France and Holland, for example, had a poor record
on adopting legislation on the harmonisation of pharmaceutical products from
other member states: Greece, Spain and Germany were dragging their feet on
insurance.
There has also been little progress with plans to create a single market in
intellectual property. In this area, half the member-states have delayed
adoption of the relevant directives. In company law, Germany, France Greece
and Spain still have a long way to go before they have put all the relevant
legislation on national statute books.
Secondly, the commission also decided to look at those areas where no
harmonisation legislation applies but where the principal of 'mutual
recognition' of technical standards is supposed to ensure that pressure
cookers made in Italy, for example, can be sold without obstacle anywhere
else in the Union.
Their decision to do so went to the heart of a dilemma facing Europe's
policy makers. In spite of the progress that has been made, countries are
still blocking goods from other member states on the often spurious grounds
that safety or technical standards do not match.
When the single market was first dreamt up, it was deemed unnecessary to
harmonise standards in all commercial sectors. Standards in sensitive areas
such as medicine, chemicals, cars and toys would be harmonised under
legislation agreed by all 12 member-states. But for the bulk of goods and
services mutual recognition was supposed to ensure that prams, lollipops,
and electric light bulbs, for example, would circulate freely.
In practice, there have been endless hitches. A commission inventory of
barriers to trade based on complaints from manufacturers shows that peas
from Belgium, for example, came up against barriers in Denmark because of
'classification problems and quality standards.' The UK objected to radishes
from Holland because of worries about a certain fly. Ceramic tiles from
Greece have been barred from the French market because of 'difficulties in
obtaining type approval.'
Generally, the complaints tend to come from manufacturers in the EU's
smaller member states who cannot get their goods circulated in the larger
countries. A survey by the Danish ministry of finance produced a shockingly
high number of complaints about remaining technical barriers to trade.
As a result, the commission is coming under pressure to produce more
harmonisation legislation, particularly from the less powerful EU members
such as Denmark and Spain to deal with those areas where mutual recognition
is failing.
'There have been a lot of concerns from caravan makers,' says a commission
official from DG15, the directorate responsible for the internal market.
'We have had pressure to produce a directive over things like dimensions and
the materials with which the caravans are made.'
As a first step, a new commission proposal recommends a change to the way in
which complaints are recorded. At present, the commission relies on
manufacturers to keep it informed of what is happening at a grassroots
level. Now it wants to switch the onus to the authorities who are doing the
refusing.
In other words, any national authority that refuses a product from one
country will have to notify the commission thereby providing Brussels with a
more complete record of where problems are arising and where more
harmonisation legislation might eventually be required. But as one
commission official explains: 'This rather simple proposal is running into
all sorts of difficulties.'
Some member-states - notably the UK - are very keen on the proposal. 'It is
something that we think is very important,' says an official from the UK
representation in Brussels. The French and Germans, however, have argued
that there are so many examples of where one country is blocking another's
goods that the proposal will spawn unnecessary bureaucracy.
Whether or not the member-states can reach a consensus on the proposal will
only be known in October when relevant ministers meet again to discuss the
single market.
Until then, and until the information has been gathered, the commission will
continue to favour mutual recognition as a better, less cumbersome, route
than legislation, partly because legislation is so costly, but also
conscious of the fact that a directive on caravans, or peas would do nothing
for the image of the meddling Brussels bureaucrat.
But if mutual recognition continues to be flouted by the Union's biggest and
most powerful states, some countries, and many manufacturers, will step up
pressure for more harmonisation. At that point, Brussels will have to decide
how best to tackle the grievances of traders and decide whether or not more
legislation is required to maintain momentum behind the single market.

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (2): A new way to do business - Privatisation,
impact assessment / The liberalisation of national trading regimes has
provided the impetus for exporters to acquire fixed assets in their target
markets, where previously they were content only to ship goods in pure trade
transactions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The privatisation fever which has increasingly gripped developing and former
command economies has had more profound consequences for exporting outside
the OECD region than even the global debt crisis of the 1950s. In Latin
America, Asia and eastern Europe, multinational companies and small and
medium-sized enterprises must deal with clients with private sector
perceptions and problems, rather than the state procurement agencies and
distribution companies which dominated in centralised economies.
'The chief feature of privatisation regarding trade is that the channels of
supply have changed,' says Hans Peter Lankes, an economist with the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
The privatisation of public companies and the introduction of market rules
to formerly state-dominated economies has also resulted in investment
following trade in regions such as Latin America. The liberalisation of
national trading regimes has given new impetus to exporters to acquire fixed
assets in target markets, where previously they were content only to ship
goods in pure trade transactions.
This has the advantage of securing important markets and may provide a
regional base for exporting from within the target market to neighbouring
economies.
Procter &amp; Gamble, for example, has established manufacturing and sales
operations in Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay and Ecuador are serviced from these countries,
says Bill Dobson, a P&amp;G executive - 'we can sell into these markets
primarily because of their size, and we can now handle their needs from
Argentina and Brazil.'
The emerging business classes of newly industrialising countries also see
the benefits of the private way of doing business. In Argentina, an
enthusiastic privatiser, privatised companies claim to be paying some 30 per
cent less for their inputs, compared to the levels paid by their former
public sector managements.
The experience of privatisation has political ramifications, in some cases
weakening governments' ability to wield the trade weapon in disputes as in
the past. The Malaysian boycott of British goods over the Pergau dam affair
was arguably weakened by the sanctions being applied only to public sector
contracts.
During the decade or so of IMF and World Bank-sponsored structural
adjustment, many governments have been reluctant to follow the privatised
trade route. But the number of converts has risen sharply with the
realisation that only by promoting private business could budget deficits
and debt burdens be realistically reduced and economies become more
competitive.
In sectors such as telecommunications, the need to keep pace with rapid
technological advances has forced the pace and opened markets to
multinationals. This is now seen as an essential trend even without the
multilateral pressure to liberalise from the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (Gatt) and other organisations.
The scale of demand for infrastructure in newly industrialising economies
means that private projects are becoming as important as public sector
schemes in many such countries. As a result build-operate-transfer (Bot),
build-operate-own (Boo) and other private alternatives to sovereign
financing for projects have begun to take root.
Not long ago, private projects such as the 1,230-MW Paiton power plant in
Indonesia - costing Dollars 1.8bn and financed by a consortium of
international banks and lending organisations - would only have been carried
out by the state.
There are pitfalls associated with the break with well-established patterns
in financing exports. In many difficult markets, obtaining financing is far
from easy and the intervention of multilateral and state agencies remains
essential.
Private capital 'continues to exhibit great reluctance to provide regular
access to the likely amount of finance needed,' to fund exports to many
developing markets, according to a draft report presented to Congress by the
Export-Import Bank of the US (Eximbank), this summer. Consequently, the
report concluded, 'the need for Eximbank seems to be expanding.'
Among the problems to be confronted selling into emerging economies with
growing private sectors are the following:
Assessing risk may be more difficult:
Securing export credit agency (ECA) guarantees and commercial credits is
more complicated in regions such as eastern Europe, where business was
traditionally transacted with public sector buyers backed by state
guarantees.
Judging the credit-worthiness of new banks and buyers can be problematic
when western banks generally like to see five years of accounts, audited to
international standards.
'We attend conferences where we applaud eastern Europe for opening up to
private business and we send people to help them develop their new private
banks,' says a senior European banker says. 'But outside a few places like
the Czech Republic, what we're talking about is much greater risk than we
knew when there was one Vneshekonombank, the former Soviet Bank for Foreign
Economic Affairs, one ministry responsible for procurement - and you knew
just who to talk to. Now we are unsure of the commercial risk; we don't know
the banks and, in some cases, the mafia is running the country.'
The rapid increase in privately funded projects: The advent of Bot-type
schemes calls for new financing instruments. Multilateral agencies, ECAs and
banks have had to adapt to tap markets which are seeking private projects
without recourse to the traditional sovereign guarantees.
The UK's Export Credits Guarantees Department (ECGD) is among ECAs which are
introducing a new generation of products, such as the recently revamped
overseas investment insurance scheme (OIIS) and an expanded project finance
facility, which can now provide similar levels of cover as those made
available for the buyer credits allocated to capital goods exports.
Such is the increase in demand that ECGD insured as much investment in the
first three months of the 1994/95 financial year as in the whole of the
previous year. But it is not just in the buyer countries that western
companies are having to adjust to privatisation and a reduced role for the
state.
Political considerations and state support remain factors in securing
prestige contracts, but increasingly capital goods exporters and contractors
do not have the same access as before to official credits for commercial
projects and trade facilities, such as short-term export credit insurance.
This is because the private market now provides most credit insurance
support in the UK, where more than 10 insurers, including some of Europe's
biggest companies, now offer facilities.
This trend is set to continue. The OECD has announced new measures to
consolidate the so-called Helsinki rules, introduced in 1992. These aim to
further separate commercial financing from aid. This involves measures such
as abolishing remaining subsidised interest rates and linking the maturities
of credit repayments to countries' economic performance (with only the
poorest countries benefitting from the most extended terms).
Further work is planned by the OECD, the European Union and other agencies
to further harmonise export credit practices and better regulate the use of
export credits for agricultural products.

FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (1): New agenda for world trade - Martin Wolf
examines prospects for world trade after the Uruguay Round - the most
complex and ambitious trade negotiation ever attempted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOOKING AHEAD: The ability of the industrial countries to adjust to emerging
giants, such as China and India, must be in question.  If they fail,
protection would probably be the outcome.
From the beginning of next year, world trade is to be overseen by a new
institution, the World Trade Organisation. Forget, for the moment, the fact
that a successor to Mr Peter Sutherland, outgoing Director General of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, has still to be found. Ignore
nagging doubts about whether the Uruguay Round will be ratified. Despite
everything, it is far more likely than not that the US and European Union
will resolve their internal difficulties and ratify the outcome of their
seven years of hard labour.
What sort of trading scene will the new body have to deal with?
The starting point is the outcome of the Uruguay Round itself. The most
complex and ambitious trade negotiation ever attempted, its completion was a
remarkable and, on balance, hugely beneficial achievement. The commitment to
bringing virtually all aspects of world trade under a single umbrella is
particularly important. Gone is the special status granted for 33 years to
textiles and clothing; gone is the virtual exclusion of agriculture from
international disciplines; gone also is the purely ad hoc approach to the
liberalisation of trade in services.
Perhaps most important of all, there is now an integrated and more effective
system of dispute settlement, something required by any effective
international agreement of this kind. Nor should the trade liberalisation
aspects themselves be ignored. There is, for example, a significant
reduction in the level of tariffs: the average developed-country tariff on
industrial products will fall by almost 40 per cent - from 6.3 to 3.9 per
cent. Large reductions in developing country tariffs are also planned
For all that, as Brian Hindley of the London School of Economics points out
in a review of the round, it leaves some important problems in its wake.*
Among them are:
The potential for confusion if some countries choose to be members of the
original Gatt (Gatt 1947), but not the WTO, while others choose to be
members of the WTO, but not Gatt 1947.
The weak obligations in the General Agreement on Trade in Services and the
limited nature of the commitments to trade liberalisation in services.
The possibly deleterious effects on the developing countries of the strong
protection afforded to intellectual property.
The very limited nature of the liberalisation of trade in agriculture.
The long delays in liberalisation of trade in textiles and clothing, which
is to be completed only by 2005, with most of the meaningful liberalisation
postponed until the last few years.
And, above all, the limited significance of the decision to tighten up on
'grey area measures,' such as voluntary export restraints, particularly
given the failure to discipline the use of anti-dumping measures as a
protectionist device.
The global policy-making community must, however, do more than cope with
what the Uruguay Round failed to do. Already there is a new agenda. One
element in it is trade and the environment, on which a committee was
established at the ministerial meeting in Marrakesh in April. Another issue
being pushed by the Clinton administration, with French support, is trade
and labour standards, a topic as controversial  - and potentially as
threatening, particularly from the developing country point of view - as
trade and the environment.
Also being discussed as potential topics for inclusion in future
negotiations are trade and competition policy and, still more tentatively,
the treatment of investment. In addition, the WTO must negotiate membership
for China, Russia and other former states of the Soviet Union.
All this is the visible face of trade policy. Underneath it, there are two
contrasting trends. Developing countries - long addicted to protectionism,
demands for 'special and differential treatment' and non-reciprocity - have
been liberalising their trade barriers, both unilaterally and within the
context of the Uruguay Round, as is also true of former members of the
Soviet bloc.
More than 60 countries notified the Gatt secretariat of unilateral trade
liberalisation during the course of the Uruguay Round. While these were
mainly developing and former communist countries, their number included
hitherto-protectionist Australia and New Zealand.
Such liberalisation has made trade from - and to - the more outward-looking
developing countries the most dynamic single element in world trade. Between
1981 and 1992, world trade grew at an average annual rate, in real terms, of
5.2 per cent (itself above the rate of growth of world output). But imports
of developing countries in the East Asia and Pacific region grew at 7.8 per
cent a year, while their imports from one another grew at the still more
dramatic average rate of 14.9 per cent a year.
For much of the 1980s, the Latin American developing countries were relative
laggards. But signs of faster growth began to emerge there, too, in the
1990s, in response to policy reform. Thus the volume of regional exports
rose by 7 and 9.5 per cent in 1992 and 1993, respectively, while the volume
of imports went up by 18 and 8 per cent.
Developing countries are looking increasingly outward, so following the
advice long showered upon them by advanced industrial countries. Meanwhile,
many in the latter have become increasingly dubious about the entire idea.
During the course of the Uruguay Round, there emerged powerful protectionist
pressures in industrial countries, as unemployment soared in Europe and the
real wages of unskilled labour fell in the US. The influence of Mr Ross
Perot in the last presidential election is one symptom of this development.
The agitation against the Gatt in France is another.
The academic literature on the effect of trade on wages and employment is
vast and hitherto somewhat inconclusive. Most authors would agree that
changes in technology have been more important for the demand for unskilled
labour than imports from developing countries. But the ability of the
industrial countries to adjust to the emergence of giants, such as China
(already the world's 11th largest exporter) and India, must be in question.
Should they fail, protection would probably be the outcome.
This would then endanger the achievements of the Uruguay Round and even the
WTO. Things would be still worse if, as seems plausible, the developing
countries were to respond in kind. But if the pressure were to be resisted,
the prospect for dynamic growth of exports to developing and former
communist countries should be a golden one. This could even prove the start
of an epoch of trade expansion as dynamic as that of the 1950s and 1960s.

Lal (eds), Trade Policy Review 1994, (London: Centre for Policy Studies,

FT  05 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Media hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Newspaper groups came under pressure as this year's advertising spending
forecasts were revised downwards.
The industry's umbrella organisation, the Advertising Association, now
believes that spending for publicity in national newspapers will rise only 8
per cent in 1994 against a previous forecast of 10 per cent. It said
regional newspaper ad-spend would increase by 7.5 per cent compared with a
previous forecast of 9.5 per cent.
SG Warburg pointed out the figures to clients, and Telegraph shares fell 7
to 323p while Express parent United Newspapers shed 4 to 488p. News
International slipped 13 to 233p and Pearson, which owns the Financial Times
and the Westminster Press regional newspaper group, saw an early 12 gain
eroded, leaving the stock only a penny firmer on the day at 600p.
The latest grim news from a hard hit merchant bank sector spilled over to
Reuters Holdings. The international news and financial information group is
the biggest supplier of dealing screens and even Mr Brian Newman, the
long-term enthusiast from agency broker Henderson Crosthwaite, was
discussing the impact to the company of losses suffered by its key clients.
Dealers added that a sell order in the morning had been clumsily handled.
The combination of technical and fundamental factors saw the shares slide 15
to 452p in spite of news that the company has announced UK price rises of up
to 5 per cent effective from January 1.
News of short-time working at Ford Motor put the motor component suppliers
into a spin and even managed to cast a shadow over British Steel, one of the
stock market's more easily identified defensive shares.
T&amp;N was singled out for most of the day's punishment, tumbling 14 to 208p
following Ford's decision to cut production at its two biggest plants
through October. GKN fell 12 to 601p on 1.8m traded.
The depression spread right across the sector. BBA lost 5 at 178p, Avon
Rubber shed 11 to 570p and Lucas Industries receded 11 to 181p, although
with the last-mentioned the impending interim results - due on Monday and
expected to contain restructuring provisions of up to Pounds 50m - helped to
heighten the tension.
The consensus among analysts was that the downswing was an overreaction,
with Ford's move seen largely as stock adjustment ahead of what is
essentially a low selling final quarter.
With the exception of British Steel - down 3 1/2 at 164 1/2 p after 12m
turnover - trading volume was mostly light.
The gloom surrounding financial stocks associated with bond and equity
trading teams deepened as Hambros, the merchant bank, followed SG Warburg in
warning of a steep decline in interim profits. Hambros said its bond
business had suffered a major deterioration.
Bank analysts immediately hacked their current year profits estimates, which
were reduced by around Pounds 35m. Hambros shares finished 26 cheaper at
225p.
BT made good progress, the shares closing 3 1/2 firmer at 363 1/2 p as
NatWest Securities described the stock as a 'sound selection in a nervous
stock market' and moved its recommendation from 'hold' to 'add'.
NatWest pointed out BT's consistent underperformance over the last four
quarters and said technical pressure associated with the final instalment
had been removed. 'The interims on November 11 should produce encouraging
call volume statistics and we are forecasting a 6.3 per cent increase in the
dividend to 7.07p,' said NatWest.
British Aerospace confirmed that it is in discussions regarding a possible
recommended offer for VSEL, which gained 18 at 1195p. BAe dipped 3 to 439p
on the announcement.
An upbeat trading statement from contract catering company Compass Group
helped the shares rise 8 to 327p. The company begins a round of analysts
meetings today and researchers said they would wait to see the company
before upgrading profits expectations.
Vendome closed 11 ahead at 505p, with UBS said to have issued a buy
recommendation on the stock.
Anglo-Dutch group Unilever appreciated 13 to 1125p as the company held a
series of one-to-one meetings with analysts for an update on current
trading.
Third-quarter trading was said to have shown good progress, with the hot
summer having boosted sales of soft drinks and ice cream in the UK. The
company is Europe's biggest ice cream manufacturer. Analysts also suggested
that the economic recovery in the rest of Europe should boost earnings next
year.
Kleinwort Benson urged investors to buy the stock, as did Strauss Turnbull,
which said: 'There is scope for a rerating to move the stock on to a market
p/e'
US buying lifted selected pharmaceuticals stocks. Glaxo improved 10 1/2 to
583p and Wellcome 9 to 663p.

FT  05 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Buy-back lifts recs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cazenove, the stockbroker, moved swiftly to implement Midlands Electricity's
buy-back programme, purchasing 21.2m shares at 725p apiece in a deal
identical to that carried out some weeks ago by Northern Electricity.
Cazenove had to move sharply to buy the shares ahead of Midlands' 'closed'
period which commences tomorrow. Turnover in Midlands reached 46m shares.
Midlands' buy-back involved its broker buying in stock from institutions and
selling other recs back to them in a deal involving a tax credit for the
stock sold.
Midlands shares moved ahead 13 to 714p as its buy-back was completed, while
other recs raced higher as Cazenove bought in Midlands stock and sold back
other recs shares.
The institutions chased those stocks which have permission to buy in shares
but have not yet done so ahead of their respective closed periods. These
included East Midlands, which forged ahead 25 to 713p, and is entitled to
buy in 21.9m shares ahead of its closed period due to start in the middle of
this month; and Eastern, which can buy up to 38.4m shares until October 12.
Eastern advanced 20 to 727p. Yorkshire, 19 1/2 stronger at 710p, and
Southern, 27 higher at 721p, were other recs entitled to buy in stock but
yet to do so. Yorkshire can buy up to 20m shares and Southern's limit is
27.2m.

FT  05 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares rally but trading volume
remains poor - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An improvement in British government bond prices helped the UK stock market
to struggle above the Footsie 3,000 mark again yesterday, but traders
described the rally as unconvincing. Trading volume was poor after stripping
out one large buy-back operation in the regional electricity stocks and the
market closed off the top as Wall Street made a slow start to the new
session.
At the close the FT-SE 100-share Index was 18.3 ahead at 3,001.8, largely on
the back of firm stock index future and gilt-edged sectors. With the Dow
Industrial Average a shade off in London hours and other European bourses
mixed, there was little spirit in the UK equity market in the second half of
the session.
One reason for the market's lack of enthusiasm came from the merchant
banking sector, when Hambros followed SG Warburg by warning that profits for
the first half of the year would show a heavy fall. It was the turn of the
smaller merchant bank stocks to suffer yesterday. Warburg steadied from the
savage losses of the previous day.
Also weak were shares in the car component manufacturers after Ford UK
disclosed that its two largest British factories are to go on short-time
working as both home and export markets disappoint the company's hopes. The
news outweighed any benefits from more favourable comments on trading by car
manufacturers in continental Europe, including Volkswagen and Opel, General
Motor's German operation.
There was a setback across the privatised water stocks in the wake of
warnings from the annual conference of Britain's opposition Labour party
that if returned to power it would take a 'tough, rigorous' line on public
control.
The market received a tonic early in the session with a 21.6m-share buy-back
from Midlands Electricity. The proceeds of around Pounds 154m were believed
to have been put back, via the broking houses, to the other regional
electricity stocks, lifting the sector and providing a boost to the market's
confidence as well as to its liquidity.
Without the boost from the Midlands deals, trading volume would have been
nearly 6 per cent down - the day's total Seaq figure of 528.7m shares
compared with 521.1m in the previous session. Monday's retail business was
worth Pounds 1.14bn, still a profitable level for the larger securities
firms but well below bull market levels.
However, non-Footsie business remained low yesterday at about 55 per cent of
the day's total. The dearth of activity in the smaller stocks restricted the
performance to a 5.7 gain at 3,455.3 in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which
covers a wide range of Footsie and non-Footsie shares. Dwindling turnover,
especially in the smaller-capitalisation stocks, which are often favoured by
private investors, has begun to hurt some stockbroking firms.
Analysts continued to see the UK stock market as being in a nervous mood as
it waits for further evidence of the upward pressures on global interest
rates.
The disclosure of a 0.6 per cent rise in US leading economic indicators for
August appeared to show that the US economy is continuing to recover fairly
strongly, and turned attention again on to the prospects that the Federal
Reserve may tighten policy soon.
Such tensions will increase later this week as the London market waits for
the latest payroll and unemployment statistics from the US, and braces
itself for next week's list of important data on the domestic economy.
There was little sign yesterday of the genuine recovery of confidence and
trading volume needed if the UK market is to stage the advance in the final
quarter of the year which has been predicted by many equity analysts.

Stock index futures recovered strongly after the previous session's steep
setback, but activity was low and the uptrend lacked conviction, writes
Jeffrey Brown.
Traders said the market was in drift mode, uncertain of direction. Dealing
volume was flat, slipping to just 10,383 contracts, against 15,099 on
Monday.
In the event, the FT-SE 100 December contract closed 26 points stronger at
3019.0 after touching a high of 3023.0 at stage.
At these levels the premium to the cash market was 17.2 points, with the
fair value premium standing at 14.4 points.
Turnover was very thin, with only a number of modest runs by locals -
independent traders - to occasionally enliven the proceedings.
Traders said that many houses were keeping their books very tight following
Monday's shock profits warning from SG Warburg.
News of bad derivatives experience at the top securities house weighed
heavily on sentiment and was cited as a major reason for the day's low
activity.
Turnover in traded options also fell, declining to 23,427 lots from 35,586
in the previous session.  FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume accounted for 9,628
contracts.
HSBC was the most actively traded individual stock option with 2,194 lots
dealt.

FT  05 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil sees profit taking
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sao Paulo shares retreated 2.7 per cent in moderate trade as investors
cashed profits after exit polls and a first vote count showed Mr Fernando
Henrique Cardoso close to officially becoming Brazil's president-elect.
Analysts said foreign investors were still out of the market. 'It seems they
are waiting for the final official election results before making the
decision to invest in Brazil,' one commented. Market watchers said
foreigners were probably also waiting for clear indications that an ongoing
anti-inflation plan will remain firmly on track after Mr Cardoso's virtual
victory.
The Bovespa index finished 1,489 off at 53,351. It has risen 53.2 per cent
since July 1 largely reflecting the assumption that Mr Cardoso would win
Monday's vote.

FT  05 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Canada
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A weak opening for the Toronto market turned into a rout later as the
program selling in New York sparked a freefall in share prices. The TSE 300
index plunged 70.45 to 4,274.26 and falls led rises by 542 to 238 after
volume of 58.9m shares valued at CDollars 862m.
The TSE got off to a bad start, rocked by a drop in the overnight spot price
for gold that sparked more profit-taking in gold shares, which are heavily
weighted in the TSE 300. An edging up of yields after yesterday morning's
T-bill auction added to weakness in Canadian stocks.

FT  05 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow tumbles on rate fears
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
After a subdued start, US share prices dropped sharply across the board
yesterday afternoon as apprehension about the prospect of another interest
rate increase spread throughout the stock market, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 45.76 down at 3,801.13, having
barely moved for the first three hours. Other indices moved in similar
fashion. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 relinquished 7.14 at
454.60, while the American SE composite shed 4.65 to 453.81 and the Nasdaq
composite was 13.58 weaker at 747.30. Trading volume on the New York SE was
a heavy 326m shares.
The equity market initially followed the pattern of trading on the bond
market, with stocks rising modestly at the bell in the wake of an upbeat
start by Treasury prices. On Monday, bonds fell steeply following signs of
rising inflation in the National Association of Purchasing Management's
monthly report, but yesterday morning they stabilised, thanks in part to
news of a 0.6 per cent rise in August leading economic indicators, in line
with expectations.
Inflation worries, however, were never far from the surface, and both the
bond and stock markets soon dropped back from their early highs. On Friday
the government is due to release the September employment report, and if the
report is stronger than expected, analysts believe the Federal Reserve will
sanction another increase in interest rates.
Those fears deepened after September car sales came in higher than expected,
and by the late afternoon heavy program selling had pushed the Dow more than
50 points lower, triggering the NYSE's 'circuit breakers' which limit
program trading. The breakers helped to lift the Dow back above 3,800 in the
last few minutes before the close.
Among individual stocks, the big three vehicle manufacturers were not helped
by the strong car sales numbers. General Motors, which announced a shake-up
of senior management in its North American division, receded Dollars 1 1/4
to Dollars 45 1/8 , Ford Motor dipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 27 1/8 and
Chrysler shed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 44.
American Express put on Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 30 1/4 following reports
that it planned to cut as many as 4,800 jobs and more than Dollars 500m in
operating costs in a restructuring of its travel services business.
Carter-Wallace, the drugs and toiletry products group, firmed Dollars 3/8 to
Dollars 13 3/4 after announcing that it would take a Dollars 49m pre-tax
charge in the second quarter to cover the cost of redundancies, plant
closures and a restructuring of its laboratories unit.
Computer chip manufacturers suffered in the wake of negative comments about
earnings from Advanced Micro Devices on Monday.

FT  05 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei lower on new
issue worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Increasing worries over the fall in Japan Telecom and pessimism over the
subscription for Japan Tobacco shares took the Nikkei 225 average into a
moderate loss on small-lot selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index finished 81.42 off at 19,568.61 after trading within a narrow
range between 19,651.83 and 19,525.71. Volume totalled 161m shares, against
Monday's 158m. Most investors were inactive, including corp-orate investors
and public funds.
The Topix index of all first section stocks relinquished 6.21 at 1,572.79
and the Nikkei 300 shed 1.45 to 287.50. Declines outnumbered rises by 526 to
388, with 223 issues unchanged, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
softened 0.14 to 1,288.09.
The Finance Ministry announced the winners of the lottery for the 436,666
Japan Tobacco shares on public offer. Investors that won have until next
Tuesday to purchase the shares, but most market participants expect a
shortage of subscribers due to current market conditions and recent weakness
of Japan Telecom.
The latter, listed on the second section and a recent benchmark for market
sentiment, lost Y70,000 at Y3.8m after sinking to a new intra-market low of
Y3.78m. DDI, another second section telecom company, dipped Y2,000 to
Y864,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined Y9,000 to Y862,000.
Brokerage shares were weak on the low trading volume. Nomura Securities
receded Y50 to Y1,980 and Nikko Securities Y20 to Y1,090.
Nippon Shinpan, a consumer credit company, dropped Y55 to Y758 on rumours of
financial problems at its financial affiliates, due to mounting bad loans.
Steels were actively traded. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day,
slipped Y4 to Y384 and Kawasaki Steel declined Y6 to Y439.
High-priced stocks were sold, with Nintendo, the video game maker, Y310
lower at Y5,460. The company announced that its first-half pre-tax profits
fell 16 per cent, down from its initial forecast due to the higher yen and
sluggish domestic sales.
Nintendo's weakness dragged down Sega Enterprises, another video equipment
maker, which retreated Y430 to Y5,650 on earnings worries.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 33.30 to 21,962.98 in volume of 8.3m
shares.
Roundup
A mixture of influences drove the Pacific Rim markets.
SYDNEY ended below key support at a 2 1/2 -month low amid mounting concern
over rising local interest rates, but overall volumes were thin. The All
Ordinaries index closed 32.9 or 1.6 per cent down at 1,998.0.
News Corp fell 41 cents or 4.8 per cent to a 14-month low of ADollars 8.06
as investors took a scathing view of the group's preference share issue
aimed at financing acquisitions without diluting Mr Rupert Murdoch's
control.
WELLINGTON declined almost 1 per cent as an already weak market was
unsettled further when Mr Don Brash, the Reserve Bank governor, told a
parliamentary select committee that inflationary pressures were greater than
forecast just a month ago.
He said that he was comfortable with the sharp rise in interest rates in the
interim and did not see any need for further tightening.
The NZSE-40 capital index ended 19.73 down at 2,057.50. Telecom and Fletcher
Challenge, the two stocks which had shown greatest strength recently, led
the falls, each losing 6 cents at NZDollars 5.29 and NZDollars 4.24
respectively.
SEOUL pressed ahead to a new closing high, the composite index rising 10.41
to 1,064.64, with the announcement of a partial cabinet reshuffle involving
the country's top economic ministers helping to boost sentiment.
A 1.8 per cent fall in the banking sub-index contrasted with the day's
gains. The newly listed Citizens National Bank went the day's limit up of
Won800 to Won17,400 but other banking issues were lacklustre.
TAIPEI edged back as profits were taken in financial stocks after their
recent strong run. The weighted index was finally 3.83 off at 7,179.92 after
an opening high of 7,228.33. Turnover was a modest TDollars 57.6bn.
Among losing financials, ICBC shed 50 cents to TDollars 104.5. Closed-end
funds, however, rose on newspaper reports that some would pay good dividends
by the year-end. Kwang Hua Fortune Fund put on 5 cents at TDollars 13.25 and
Yuan Ta Duo Yuan 20 cents at TDollars 15.2.
MANILA saw a broad-based advance which lifted the composite index 32.27 to
2,953.61.
HONG KONG made small gains during a session that was featureless except for
some speculative interest in second line issues. The Hang Seng index was up
11.63 at 9,504.12, off a high of 9,547.78.
BOMBAY was firmer, led by polyester fibre and yarn makers, which announced
that they were raising prices of their products. The BSE 30-share index
gained 26.68 at 4,366.14.
SINGAPORE was led ahead by firm foreign demand for banks, properties and
other blue chips, but Malaysian shares traded over the counter faced selling
pressure.
The Straits Times Industrial index moved up 22.04 to 2,370.56. Malaysia's
Yeo Hiap Seng climbed 85 cents to SDollars 8.85 on persistent rumours that a
takeover was in the making.
KARACHI jumped the 2,300-point barrier for the first time since August 11 in
brisk trading, boosted by overseas interest in cement and polyester stocks
ahead of year-end results. The KSE 100-share index rose 16.07 to 2,310.54.
COLOMBO was lower for a fifth straight day on reduced foreign support, the
all-share index dipping 10.90 to 1,124.68.

FT  05 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa turns back from highs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A bullish start was made to Johannesburg trading as the market assessed the
ratings assigned to the country's foreign currency long term debt. But the
early promise was not fulfilled as a firmer financial rand and softer gold
price dragged shares off highs to end mostly down on the day.
Dealers said investors were generally encouraged by the investment grade
BAA3 rating assigned by Moody's but they had reservations about the
speculative BB rating assigned by Standard &amp; Poor's.
Key industrials attracted steady interest amid a limited supply of scrip
before succumbing to financial rand strength.
The overall index lost a net 18 at 5,654, industrials 4 at 6,301 and golds
24 at 2,400.
Anglos fell R2 to R238, JCI was off R1 at R105 and Vaal Reefs declined R5 to
R472.
SAB reversed an earlier gain to close 50 cents softer at R84 but Barlows
remained in demand, adding 65 cents at R31, and Sappi rose R2 to R58.

FT  05 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Feelings stay mixed as Paris,
Zurich rebound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sentiment was mixed following last week's fears, and Monday's lack of
enthusiasm, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS saw some bottom-fishing as the market rebounded from Monday's new low.
The CAC-40 index rose 23.29 or 1.3 per cent to 1,876.12 in turnover of
FFr3.1bn; but a number of blue chips advanced 3 or 4 per cent.
Analysts remarked upon the gains for Generale des Eaux and Lyonnaise des
Eaux, up FFr19.20 to FFr477.20 and FFr20.80 to FFr489 respectively in quite
significant volume. The two water companies have been depressed in recent
months by allegations of irregularities in political party funding and
similar matters; French utilities were down by 10.7 per cent in the third
quarter against a 1 per cent decline in the market and it may be, said
professionals, that some investors were beginning to look at their earnings
potential.
Elsewhere, buyers were still risk averse, Credit Lyonnais falling back
again, by FFr9 to FFr421, as the bank denied talk of unconditional state
backing. LVMH lost a further FFr15 at FFr827 following moves to simplify the
luxury product group's structure.
FRANKFURT came back from the Unity Day holiday, and caught up with Monday's
falls elsewhere, the Dax index shedding 16.80 to 1,994.95 on the session and
easing to 1,988.67 in the post bourse.
US selling seemed to have eased, and turnover fell from DM7.6bn to DM6bn;
but it was no day to be in some second liners, with traders news sensitive
and a lack of buyers to soak up small selling.
A DB Research earnings downgrade for Asko, the retailer, took the shares
another DM85 lower to DM775, down from DM1,000 on August 30 and a January
high of DM1,275.
In construction, Holzmann's rights issue at DM650 left the shares DM31 lower
at DM885; in the same sector, Hochtief dropped DM40 to DM934; and in
engineering, Deutsche Babcock lost DM221.90 - another case of brokers'
forecasts being a little too optimistic, said Ms Barbara Altmann at B
Metzler in Frankfurt.
ZURICH rebounded after the sharp losses of the previous two sessions and the
SMI index picked up 23.0 to 2,522.5.
The recovery extended to UBS bearers, up SFr21 to SFr1,191, and the
registered, SFr4 ahead at SFr287 - both had been heavily sold since last
Friday's news of the bank's capital restructuring. BK Vision, Mr Martin
Ebner's investment vehicle which is heading for a showdown over control of
UBS, rose SFr35 to SFr1,335.
Chemicals and pharmaceuticals returned to favour, with Roche certificates
recouping SFr95 to SFr5,725 and Ciba bearers up SFr8 to SFr730.
Insurers were under pressure on worries of competition from Germany's
Allianz following its purchase of Elvia. Swiss Re was an exception, putting
on a further SFr27 at SFr671 in continued response to Friday's news that it
planned to sell off its direct insurance holdings and concentrate on its
reinsurance business.
AMSTERDAM edged lower in quiet, bond-driven trading, the AEX index easing
0.29 to 398.49. ABN Amro fell 60 cents to Fl 56.80 on fears of interest rate
rises.
KNP BT extended Monday's losses, falling Fl 1.20 to Fl 50 following news of
collapsed merger talks with Ivan Allen, of the US.
Wolters Kluwer picked up Fl 1.40 to Fl 122.40 on news that it had bought the
Swiss training institute Krauthammer International.
Multihouse, a software company, rose 40 cents or 16.6 per cent to Fl 2.80 in
heavy volume on takeover rumours after a year in which the loss-making
company has been hovering just above Fl 2.00 per share.
MILAN finished easier but off the lows seen after comments by President
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, that he had not been given time to study the 1995
budget, suggested a rift between the cabinet and the presidency.
The Comit index finished 9.76 or 1.5 per cent lower at 657.98, while the
real-time Mibtel index picked up from a day's low of 10,464 to close 34
easier at 10,551.
Fiat hit an early high of L6,525 after the Fiat Auto managing director, Mr
Paolo Cantarella, said that market conditions were improving, but added that
Fiat Auto had made a loss in the first half. Subsequently the shares dropped
back to L6,477.
The banking sector continued its recent decline, Banco di Napoli losing
another L14 to L1,484 on speculation that it might be about to launch a
capital increase. Credito Italiano fell L50 to L2,010.
Benetton remained under pressure, giving up L350 to L20,400 for a fall of
7.9 per cent since last Friday's disappointing first-half results.
VIENNA traders said that buyers were reluctant to go bargain hunting ahead
of general elections in both Austria and Germany; sentiment was hit early by
weakness in the German bund future, and the early closing ATX index fell
8.42 to 1,051.54.
Economos, the seal and washer maker endangered by the possible non-payment
of a Sch100m debt from a US sibling, said it could service its own debts
even though one bank had called in credit lines. However, the shares
weakened Sch77 to Sch693.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Markets Report: D-Mark bounces back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The D-Mark was generally firmer on foreign exchanges yesterday in spite of
continued anxiety ahead of German national elections later this month,
writes Philip Gawith.
A measure of support for the German currency was also provided by Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, who told the IMF annual meeting in
Madrid that it would be a mistake to follow a policy of 'forced monetary
easing'.
Activity in the markets was generally very subdued, with the key concern
being what news Friday's US employment report will offer on inflation and
the outlook for US interest rates. The market had little in the way of
figures, policy developments or statements to focus on.
There was little follow-through buying of the dollar following the weekend
trade agreement between the US and Japan. Analysts are sceptical about what
effect the agreement will have on the trade surplus. The US currency moved
narrowly, closing in London at DM1.5519 from DM1.5573 and Y99.69 from
Y99.82. It finished in New York at DM1.5457 and Y99.63.
Sterling lost some ground, the trade weighted index ending at 80 from 80.2.
Given the pound's recent strength, some analysts said this was a temporary
correction that should be seen as a buying opportunity.
The dollar's inability to profit from the trade agreement has been taken by
the market as confirmation that its fortunes remain shackled to those of the
US bond market. Following the strong purchasing managers index released on
Monday, there is renewed concern about inflation in the US economy, with
bonds and the dollar unlikely to prosper against this backdrop.
Traders are worried about whether the employment report, and inflation
figures due next week, will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest
rates for a sixth time this year. But the minutes released last week of the
August Fed meeting, which was a prelude to a 50 basis-point increase in
interest rates, suggest that this fear may be groundless.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, said the
minutes gave the impression that the Fed felt it had done enough for no
further tightening to be required for a number of months. 'Unless the FOMC
changed its mind at its last meeting, the next tightening may be some way
off,' added Mr Hannah.
Yesterday evening the dollar received support from influential investor Mr
George Soros. He told Reuter in an interview that he saw scope for the yen
correcting to around Y115 to Y120 per dollar. He said both Japan and the US
had an interest in this taking place.
Mr Soros's comments followed recent reports that he, and fellow hedge fund
manager Mr Paul Tudor Jones, had built up large dollar positions at around
Y98.5, in anticipation of a trade agreement supporting the dollar.
Mr Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan in London, commented:
'The dollar's failure to make a sustained breach through DM1.56 and Y99.75
in spite of the falling risk environment (with the trade agreement, and
risks surrounding the German election) was an important signal that the
dollar did not have the support to move higher.'
Opinion remains split about the extent to which sterling has decoupled from
the dollar. Mr Persaud said there was 'ample evidence that the market is
viewing UK assets more favourably after the rate rise'.
But although the pound responded positively to the monetary tightening, Mr
Hannah said it would probably be caught in the cross-fire should the dollar
weaken further on inflation fears.
He said, however, that if sterling broke through DM2.45, it had the
potential to make significant headway. 'But nobody seems willing to back
that bet with significant flows,' added Mr Hannah.
The Swedish crown performed well after local exporters bought the currency.
It closed at SKr4.765/DM in London from SKr4.836. Analysts said that while
the market had greeted the new government warmly, there was a longer term
risk of conflict between the reconstituted board of the Riksbank, and the
governor.
In the UK money markets the Bank of England provided Pounds 619m assistance,
compared to a Pounds 600m shortage. Overnight money traded between 2 and 6
1/8 per cent.
Activity in the futures markets was subdued, although short sterling
contracts picked up a few ticks across the board. The December contract
closed at 93.20 from 93.19.
Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at broker GNI, said the markets were trendless
and difficult, leaving investors nervous. He said recent economic news, such
as reports of falling house prices and car manufacturer Ford moving to
shorter working hours, hardly justified the pessimism at the short end of
the yield curve. The December contract is discounting short-term rates 100
basis points higher than where they are at present.
But in spite of the value offered, 'the problem is that people just do not
have the confidence to buy the market'.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Espy resignation leaves farm
interests adrift - American farmers feel they are losing a valuable friend
at court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Espy's resignation as US Agriculture Secretary on Monday took many
US farmers by surprise, and left farm interests adrift just as they faced
their toughest battle ever to preserve their entitlement programmes before a
congress less and less interested in rural issues.
A minor light in Washington, the soft spoken, articulate Mr Espy had taken
on heroic proportions in farm country, where his rapid response to
agricultural disasters, and his pro-farm positions on trade issues won him
wide popularity.
The secretary said he would quit the Clinton cabinet at the end of the year
to 'clear his good name' in the face a widening array of allegations that he
accepted favours from the agribusinesses he was charged with regulating.
Until the announcement most farm interests brushed off the Washington talk
of ethics violations as inconsequential. 'He was a congressman, he never
really switched gears to operate like a secretary, but he is doing an
excellent job,' a Midwestern grain dealer stated last week.
In fact, Mr Espy's accomplishments during 18 months in office are
substantial. During last summer's disastrous floods, when more than 23m
acres in the Midwest were damaged, he not only expedited payment of more
than Dollars 2bn in farm disaster claims, but repeatedly visited catastrophe
areas to assure producers that government aid was on its way.
He also weathered strong criticism of the US Department of Agriculture after
tainted meat caused deaths in the US pacific north-west last year. He turned
the incident into a crusade, making food safety a major objective of the
agency.
This past summer, faced with the worst forest fire season in US history, he
was again quick to support the US forest service, which comes under the
USDA's purview.
He also won Bill Clinton allies in farm states by backing trade sanctions
against Canadian wheat imports even as he campaigned for agriculture, small
and large, to support of the administration's major trade initiatives, the
North American Free Trade Agreement and the Gatt.
In Washington, Mr Espy was forging the first overhaul of the USDA since its
creation by Abraham Lincoln in 1863. His push to close 1,200 of the agency's
14,000 field offices, and to cut the Washington bureaucracy made him enemies
in his own office, but will trim nearly Dollars 169m from the federal budget
if carried through.
Most importantly for farmers, the former Mississippi congressman was
knowledgeable about the workings of the Farm Bill, a massive piece of
legislation that governs every aspect of US Agriculture and often dictates
profit parameters for producers of scores of commodities. In place for five
years, the Farm Bill is the embodiment of pork barrel and politics.
Current US agricultural legislation is to expire next year and farm groups
and the USDA are already hard at work establishing the issues to be
addressed in the 1995 Farm Bill.
Farm interests are now concerned that any one brought on in Mr Espy's place
must immediately face the challenge of getting the Farm Bill through
congress.
Declining farm populations leave farm states with fewer representatives in
congress just as budget contraints are making urban politicians resentful of
massive US farm payments. The USDA estimates that today, 370,000 farms earn
85 per cent of US farm income and most farm programme payments go to large
farms with relatively large household incomes. It is no wonder that farm
groups feel they need an effective friend at the helm of the USDA.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Eastern Germany in turmoil over
agricultural counter-revolution - Conflicting claims are making land
privatisation even more difficult than the authorities expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Werner Loranz, who farms 1,300 hectares in the small village of Hohe
Demzin in the eastern German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, believes he is
one of the gainers from German unification.
Along with 14 other farmers who pooled their resources, he reclaimed or
rented land from the Treuhand privatisation agency, and even managed to
secure a 12-year lease in the process. Once the lease has expired, and
assuming there are no outstanding property claims, Mr Loranz will have an
option to buy the land at a preferential price.
'Things are going fine,' says the 39-year-old farmer who until 1990, worked
on the giant 6,000 hectare co-operative farm, parts of which were placed
under the Treuhand after German unification in 1990. 'We have no debts. We
made a turnover of DM1.5m (Pounds 590,000) last year. But I must tell you
that we are one of the lucky ones. Other farmers are in great difficulties'.
Officials from Germany's agricultural ministry agree. 'The restructuring and
privatisation of land in eastern Germany has proven to be one of the most
difficult processes the Treuhand has had to face,' says Mr Otto Bammell, a
senior expert at the ministry. 'Actually, I do not think the turmoil has yet
ended.'
The turmoil started when the Treuhand, with two aims in mind, set about
privatising 1.2m hectares of east German land in 1990. It first wanted to
restructure east German agriculture, which entailed breaking up the
Landwirtschaftliche Produktionsgenossenschaften, or LPGs, the large
co-operatives, and the Volkseigene Guer, or VEGs, the state farms, and then
wanted to sell the land.
In the early days of unification, the agency started selling agricultural
land. But most of the buyers were coming from western Germany. 'The east
Germans felt they were being colonised. They had no chance to buy land
because they had no money. There was terrible tension in the countryside. We
decided we had to give the easterners a chance. So we introduced the system
of leasing land at preferential rates to the easterners,' explains Mr
Bammell.
Yet even leasing land posed enormous problems for the Treuhand largely
because of property rights.
Under the terms of the unification treaty, former Nazi victims and those
whose land was confiscated by the Nazis have full rights of restitution and
compensation. These rights also apply to former land owners whose land was
confiscated by the communists between 1949 and 1990.
This meant that when the Treuhand wanted to lease land to east (or west)
Germans, it had to make sure that there were no outstanding claims on the
property. 'In some cases, the east Germans complained that they received
only short-term contracts of about three years, compared to some west
Germans who managed to obtain 12-year contracts,' says Mr Bammell. 'The
problem facing the agency was that it was afraid to extend long contracts in
case former property owners had already put in a claim. What could the
Treuhand do with an east German long-term leaseholder if a former owner
wanted to come back?'
It was often difficult to ascertain who originally owned the land. Take the
case of the LPGs. These co-operative farms were created from land
expropriated by the former Soviet Union, which ruled East Germany between
1945 and 1949, and from small East German landholders who in 1952 were
forced to place their plots in the LPGs. Often, the original land register
was closed and a new one opened that stipulated the LPG was owned by the
state.
The Treuhand is now discovering, however, that former owners or their
descendants have found the original land registers and are claiming back
their land.
'This has inevitably slowed down the whole process of leasing land,' says Mr
Bammell. 'If land has been leased by the Treuhand, even for a short time,
and if the former owner could prove legal title to it, the Treuhand can
allow the lease to run its full term, but once it has expired it must
reimburse the original owner of the rent paid to the agency from the
leaseholder.'
This sense of uncertainty about who owns land in eastern Germany, and the
delay in drawing up water-tight contracts, has been compounded by another
factor: the former land owners, usually belonging to the Prussian
aristocracy, whose land was expropriated by the Soviet administration
between 1945 and 1949.
These owners have no right of restitution, but they do have a right to buy
back their land, rent it, or, following a law passed last month, receive
limited compensation, or buy a certain amount of property in eastern Germany
at preferential rates.
'After unification, these former large landowners hesitated about buying
back their property and instead leased land in eastern Germany. They were
waiting to see what kind of compensation law would be agreed,' explains Mr
Bammell. But in the process, the privatisation - and investment in east
German agriculture - was delayed.
Eastern German farmers, such as Mr Loranz, resent the fact that these former
landowners can return and buy or rent land at preferential prices. 'But it's
not only that which upsets me,' he stresses. 'These owners have managed to
obtain long-term contracts unlike many of east Germans who had to fight hard
even to get a short-term lease. And in some cases, they do not even come
back to farm the land themselves. It is very unfair.'
Even more unfair, according to east German farmers, is the fact that those
wishing to buy land in eastern Germany can circumvent outstanding property
claims held by eastern Germans if they can prove to the Treuhand that they
will invest and create jobs. In which case, a former landowner can only get
back the land if he or she can match that investment plan. 'The east Germans
simply do not have the money to compete with the west Germans,' complains Mr
Loranz. Ministry officials argue, however, that incentives for investors
were a crucial instrument for reviving eastern German agriculture.
In spite of the scale of these problems, the Treuhand is in the process of
drawing up 9,000 contracts, which involves leasing 90,000 hectares on
short-term contracts and about 788,000 on long-term contracts. 'East German
agriculture is slowly stabilising,' says Mr Bammell. 'But we have paid a
high price for ending the turmoil and creating a propertied class.'

Base metal prices eased in late trading at the London Metal Exchange but the
three months delivery ZINC price, which earlier reached a 20-month high on
investment fund buying, was still up Dollars 27 a tonne at the close.
Meanwhile ALUMINIUM'S continuing rally lifted it to a fresh 3 3/4 -year high
of Dollars 1,645 a tonne for three months delivery at one point. The move
was encouraged by another big fall in LME stocks.
After falling early on COPPER prices ended about Dollars 30 a tonne up on
balance.
COFFEE futures rose in light volume as the Brazilian weather continued to
give cause for concern.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: European salmon farmers set for
a bumper year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This will be the most profitable year for salmon farming in northern Europe
for some time, confounding the predictions of many industry experts,
according to a Norwegian salmon industry executive.
Mr Jostein Refsnes, executive vice-president of Hydro Seafood, a large
salmon producer in Norway and Scotland, attributed the upturn to a yield
boost at existing farms thanks to improved methods and better disease
control.
This was combined with a rise in demand in Europe and the Far East in
response to competitive prices and better marketing, notably by the Scots,
he told the annual Scottish fish farming conference in Aviemore, Scotland.
The optimistic picture painted by Mr Refsnes contrasts with the gloomy one
drawn earlier this year by Scottish salmon farmers. In February they urged
the European Union to investigate allegedly unfair subsidies given to
Norwegian farmers, which caused over-production and drove prices down.
Since then the Scottish farmers' relations with the Norwegians have improved
and they have benefited from the factors listed by Mr Refsnes. Farms can now
make a profit even though prices have not increased much in real terms.
Mr Refsnes said the Far Eastern market for Norwegian salmon had grown by 68
per cent this year, while that in Europe was up by 23 per cent. Scottish
attempts to hinder the free flow of Norwegian salmon into the EU had not
succeeded.
The Scottish salmon growers association says UK demand has risen 26 per cent
rise this year. Output is expected to reach 59,000 tonnes, up from 45,000
tonnes in 1993. Norway is expected to produce 220,000 tonnes and Mr Refsnes
expected the gap in output between the two countries to widen.
Mr Refsnes criticised the idea, strongly advocated by Scottish farmers, of
establishing producer organisations to control output and sustain prices.
That, he said, would slow the development of the industry into larger units
and allow the inefficient to survive.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: Rate rise fears hit long-dated US Treasury
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury prices fell at the long end of the maturity range in thin
trading as investor concern about another interest rate increase deepened
ahead of Friday's all-important jobs data.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  11/32 at 95
9/16 , yielding 7.881 per cent. There was a lack of movement at the short
end of the market, however, where the two-year note was unchanged at 99, to
carry a yield of 6.653 per cent.
Trading was extremely quiet from the opening. The day's main economic news -
a 0.6 per cent rise in leading economic indicators during August - met
analysts' expectations, and was largely ignored.
Instead, attention remained firmly focused on the September employment
report, due on Friday. Following fresh signs of economic strength, the
market is bracing itself for another interest rate increase, and investors
fear the tightening could come as soon as Friday if the September jobs data
are much stronger than expected.
If non-farm payrolls prove to have risen by 300,000 or more, analysts expect
the Federal Reserve to raise rates immediately. It was fear of this
scenario, coupled with a weaker dollar and news of stronger than expected
September car sales, that hit prices yesterday. European government bond
markets regained their poise after Monday's slippage, but sentiment remained
fragile and dealers said they expected trade to stay directionless ahead of
Friday's release of US employment data.
They reported little activity from investors, many of whom are seen to be
holding their fourth-quarter asset allocation meetings.
While inflation fears continue to overhang the bond markets, 'many investors
are beginning to attach higher risk to the prospect of equity weakness,
which could lead to strength in bonds', said Mr Malcolm Roberts, head of
global bond research at Union Bank of Switzerland.
In recent weeks traders have reported increased shifts into bonds from
equities, especially in the UK markets.
Moreover, observers say that many cash-rich investment institutions may be
more likely to put fresh funds into bonds rather than equities.
'There is a sense that equities in many markets are expensive relative to
bonds,' says Mr Roberts.
UK gilts put on the best performance of the day, gaining nearly half a point
after losing almost a point on Monday. The December long gilt futures
contract rose by  13/32 to 99 5/16 .
Among other factors, gilts gained support from spread-purchases against
German bonds. After widening to 151 basis points on Monday, the 10-year
yield spread over bunds narrowed to 135 basis points yesterday.
Gilts were also underpinned by a more sanguine assessment of Monday's M0
money supply data, which were seen as something of an aberration, and
reports of falling house prices and short-time work at two Ford car plants
in the UK.
German bonds made little progress, ending barely changed after a day of
range-trading.
'The World Bank's DM2bn issue of five-year eurobonds was the major focus in
the D-Mark sector; there wasn't much to inspire the bund market,' said one
trader.
Meanwhile, the October 16 federal elections continue to weigh on bunds, and
traders said they did not expect to see significant investor activity in the
bund market before then.
French government bonds outperformed their German counterparts, causing the
10-year yield spread over bunds to narrow to 55 basis points from 65 on
Monday.
Tomorrow's auction of some FFr18bn - FFr20bn of 10-year bonds did not weigh
on the market, with dealers expecting the 7.5 per cent coupon on the new OAT
to attract solid investor demand.

FT  05 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Morgan Stanley to advise GPA
Group on debt refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, has been awarded the mandate to
advise GPA Group, the aircraft leasing company, on further refinancing
options ahead of significant debt repayments due in 1996 and 1998.
Both GPA and Morgan Stanley were keen to point out that no decision had been
taken as to what form the refinancing would take.
'This is part of a long-term planning exercise. GPA is now in a position to
consider well in advance its refinancing payments in 1996 and 1998,' GPA
said.
GPA is due to repay Dollars 1.3bn of its Dollars 5.4bn debt in September
1996. In August, it launched a Dollars 1bn securitisation of its aircraft
lease portfolio, the second of its kind by GPA, in a deal arranged by Lehman
Brothers.
Lehman Brothers continues to manage the securitisation programme and
Schroder, the UK bank, will continue in its current role as an independent
adviser to the GPA board.
Last year, GPA completed a restructuring with the sale of a number of its
aircraft to General Electric. The company also benefited from the emergence
of America West airline from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US.
As a result of these developments and the general improvement in operating
conditions, Standard &amp; Poor's last month upgraded its rating on GPA's
secured debt to B and on its senior unsecured debt to CCC+ from CCC.

FT  05 OCT 94 / International Bonds: World Bank launches DM2bn five-year
global
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank launched its long-awaited DM2bn global offering of five-year
eurobonds yesterday.
The issue, offered with a spread of 15 basis points over German government
bonds, will be priced today, lead managers Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley
said.
The offering, the World Bank's second global D-Mark issue, was generally
well received, syndicate managers said. The deal follows the bank's Dollars
1.5bn global issue last month. Its first D-Mark global offering, of 10-year
bonds, was launched in October 1993.
The joint lead managers reported particularly strong demand from the US.
Demand from German investors was reasonably strong, given current volatile
market conditions, they said.
They estimate that the bonds will be sold mainly to institutional investors,
with 60 per cent going into Europe, 20 per cent into North America, and 20
per cent into Asia.
'With the old 10-year global bond trading quite actively, the five-year
maturity enables the World Bank to establish a new benchmark,' said a
syndicate official at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt.
In the Australian dollar sector, Bank Austria braved the volatile 10-year
maturity with an ADollars 100m offering, guaranteed by the City of Vienna
and priced to yield 35 basis points over the benchmark bond in Australian
dollars, the September 2004 Commonwealth bond.
Lead manager BZW said the deal met very good demand from institutional
investors in Europe and the Far East who were attracted by the high coupon.
Two deals were brought in the French franc sector. Horus, a Cayman Islands
special purpose vehicle which holds bonds issued by the OECD, launched a
FFr1bn 10-year deal guaranteed by Ambac, the US insurance group.
Lead manager Societe Generale said the deal had met strong demand from
institutions in Europe, which were attracted by the guarantee and the spread
of 28 basis points over comparable French treasury bonds. SocGen said the
spread did not change after the bonds were freed to trade.
Commerzbank Overseas France launched a FFr2bn five-year deal late in the
day, which lead manager Credit Commercial de France said was aimed at the
Swiss and Benelux retail market. The proceeds were swapped into
floating-rate D-Marks.
Banque Nationale de Paris, the privatised French bank, tapped the two-year
sector for L150bn, offering a coupon of 11 1/8 per cent. Mr Niccolo Nuti,
head of capital markets at Credito Italiano, the book-runner, said investors
were attracted by the high-quality name and the coupon, which was higher
than the L150bn Bayerische Hypobank deal brought last week.
Municipal Finance Authority of British Columbia launched a 10-year, CDollars
46m deal with an 8 1/2 per cent coupon. Lead manager RBC Dominion Securities
said CDollars 1.5bn of bonds are due to be redeemed this month in the
Canadian market.

FT  05 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: US institutions to buy more
foreign equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US institutional investors expect to increase substantially their overseas
equity exposure over the short and long term, and are likely to focus on
emerging markets and smaller-capitalisation issues, according to a recent
report.
The survey of US banks, insurance companies, mutual funds and pension funds,
conducted in July and August by New-York based Broadgate Consultants, found
that belief in broad-based economic recovery in Europe, widespread global
corporate restructuring and continuing development of emerging markets,
especially in Latin America, were fuelling interest in global investments.
In the survey, 84 per cent of respondents said that they expected to
increase their international equity holdings over the next five years, with
three-quarters expecting to allocate 'significantly more funds' offshore
over the next 18 months.
'Sophisticated US market participants are not limiting their global
investments to larger, high-profile companies,' the report said. Almost 70
per cent of those surveyed said small capitalisation issues had become an
essential part of their global programmes.
Emerging markets continue to hold great allure, with 74 per cent identifying
developing markets in Latin America and Asia as leading opportunities.

<TEXT>
Honda Motor is to manufacture its NX 650 Dominator motorcycle at its Italian
plant, shifting production of the model from its Japanese operation, AP-DJ
reports from Tokyo.
The car and motorcycle manufacturer said production would start before the
year end at Honda Italia's Atessa plant at an initial rate of 6,000 units a
year.
Honda is shipping production equipment for the motorcycle from its Japanese
plant to Atessa, making investment for the output start-up minimal.
The NX 650 Dominator, sold exclusively in Europe, is currently exported from
Japan. Honda will continue to export engines from its Japanese plant, but
all other parts will eventually be acquired from sources in Europe.
The company said the shift of production to Italy would help reduce
manufacturing and marketing costs, which have been affected by the strength
of the yen since last year.

FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: Accountants face lawsuit over
Carrian
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Price Waterhouse Hong Kong is being sued for HKDollars 2bn (USDollars 259m)
by liquidators of Carrian Investment, the conglomerate placed in liquidation
in October 1983 with debts of HKDollars 10bn.
The collapse of Carrian, a property and shipping group that under the
chairmanship of Mr George Tan grew to become one of Hong Kong's most
prominent companies, was the subject of a HKDollars 100m investigation by
the Hong Kong government.
A High Court case, brought by liquidators Ernst &amp; Young Hong Kong, opened in
the colony this week and is expected to continue for up to nine months. The
accountants are accused of professional negligence in failing to expose
fraud within the group.
Specifically, they face accusations that they were negligent in five
assignments for Carrian - three times as auditor and twice as reporting
accountant between 1980 and 1982. Price Waterhouse HK said it would be
mounting a 'robust and vigorous defence'.
After the 1983 collapse, Price Waterhouse accountants Mr David Begg and Mr
Anthony Lo faced charges of conspiring to defraud by making false and
misleading statements. They were acquitted in 1984.

FT  05 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: M&amp;A shows revival signs in
Japan, say brokers
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mergers and acquisitions by Japanese companies, which have been declining
since the bursting of the 'bubble economy' of the late 1980s and early
1990s, are showing signs of revival.
Reports by two leading Japanese brokers reveal that Japanese companies have
returned to mergers and acquisitions as a means of restructuring their
operations.
According to Daiwa Securities, there were 373 M&amp;A deals in the first nine
months of this year, up 26 per cent on the same stage of 1993.
However, unlike purchases during the economic boom, recent transactions
reflect efforts to counter increasing competition and to cut costs. In
contrast to transactions during the late 1980s, the average size of deals
has fallen sharply. Yamaichi Securities said the average transaction size
has dropped 46 per cent, from Y3.51bn in 1991 to Y1.9bn (Dollars 19m) so far
this year.
Daiwa said M&amp;A deals were particularly prominent in the petrochemical and
retail industries.
Japan's petrochemical industry has been hit by low domestic demand and the
appreciation of the yen, and companies are turning to mergers in order to
survive.
The discount boom and the rise of private brands in the retail industry has
prompted large supermarkets to cut out the wholesaler in order to maintain
profit margins, forcing consolidation among wholesalers. Increasing
competition among convenience stores has also prompted an increase in M&amp;A
activity.
Acquisitions of US businesses by Japanese companies rose 45 per cent to 64
deals during the nine months to September. Electronics, telecommunications
and pharmaceutical groups are investing in US venture companies to acquire
advanced expertise. Daiwa also noted a rise in purchases of plants in order
to secure manufacturing bases in North America.
Yamaichi said acquisitions of Asian companies by Japanese businesses doubled
from a year earlier, to 18 deals, although investment in Europe slowed
slightly from 24 to 23 deals.
Purchases of Japanese businesses by foreign companies rose by 9 to 30,
Yamaichi said. Japanese companies looking to restructure their operations
have turned to overseas corporations looking to expand in Japan, while the
country's deregulation efforts have started to attract foreign companies.

FT  05 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Tokyo to lift veil on
currency risks - Unrealised losses will have to be revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate Japan will over the next month or so be obliged to lift the veil
on a poorly kept yet tantalising secret.
A change in finance ministry rules will for the first time oblige companies
listed on the stock exchange or over-the-counter market to divulge
unrealised losses or profits from forward contracts to buy or sell foreign
currency for yen.
The new rules will start to have an impact from the end of this month, when
listed companies publish interim financial statements, their first since the
rule took effect on April 1.
It is another small step towards making Japanese financial markets easier to
understand and brings reporting standards more in line with the US and the
UK, reckons Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank.
Previously, companies which had misjudged forward currency contracts could
bury unrealised foreign exchange losses as depreciation charges or other
operating costs in their profit and loss accounts.
It was only once the loss had become uncomfortably large, or had to be
realised in cash, that such companies were forced to publish the bad news.
The new disclosure rule makes no difference to reported profits; it just
tells investors about Japanese companies' foreign exchange risks.
A taste of what might be to come emerged on Monday, when Japan Airlines'
share price dipped on reports, unconfirmed by the company, that it was
sitting on an unrealised currency loss of Y45bn (Dollars 451m). JAL
officials did, however, confirm that the company signed a contract 10 years
ago to buy Dollars 3.6bn with yen, in chunks at a series of pre-agreed
exchange rates.
This means JAL has, on this contract, missed the bargain presented by the US
currency's subsequent fall in value against the yen. It will now have to pay
more yen, at expensive old exchange rates, to buy dollars than if it bought
the US currency at today's rates.
Investors were quick to realise that this made little difference to the
airline's financial health, since JAL has been swallowing large undisclosed
foreign exchange losses for years, and the shares made up the lost ground
yesterday, rising Y11 to Y746. Details of the unrealised loss will be
explained in JAL's interim report on October 28.
All this invites the question of how many other corporate treasurers have
embarrassing news to relate.
The indications are not many. Government officials estimate that total
unrealised losses could amount to Y1,000bn, equivalent to about one-tenth of
listed manufacturing companies' Y10,200bn combined pre-tax profits last
year.
The sectors most likely to have to divulge exchange rate slip-ups are those
that need dollars, or other foreign currency, to buy assets or materials:
oil refiners, petrochemical groups, general trading companies and airlines,
for example.
Previous foreign exchange shockers are the best guide. They include Showa
Shell, a conservatively run oil refiner which announced a Y165bn unrealised
foreign exchange loss in February last year. Then there is Nippon Steel
Chemical, a petrochemicals group, whose head of accounting threw himself
under a train last autumn after losing nearly Y14bn in forward currency
contracts, and Kashima Oil, another refiner, with a Y152.2bn forward loss
last April.
'Many will be losses deriving from a perfectly legitimate use of foreign
exchange, even if it went spectacularly wrong,' says Mr Tom Hill, equity
strategist at SG Warburg Securities in Tokyo.
JAL, for example, needs to calculate in advance the rough cost of funding
its Dollars 800m annual aircraft purchasing requirement. Most of its
revenues are in yen, so it needs to buy dollars. A forward contract allows
JAL to choose a fixed currency rate over a multi-year aircraft buying
programme. If it misjudges and pays too much for dollars, JAL can smooth out
the loss by writing it down over the 15-year depreciation period used for
international aircraft.
For that reason, JAL's potential currency loss is no surprise to those who
follow the company closely.
However, there are likely to be red faces in other Japanese corporate
treasuries when the mid-term results season gets under way.

Renault share sale
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government yesterday took the first step in the partial
privatisation of Renault, saying it was launching the process to determine a
group of stable shareholders in the motor vehicle group.
The economy ministry said that from tomorrow, potential investors in the
core shareholding group, who will hold a combined 5 per cent of Renault's
shares, would be able to place their offers. The offer period will last for
two weeks.
Investors in the so-called group of shareholding partners will each have to
buy a minimum of 2.4m shares, about 1 per cent of the company's capital.
They will have to hold all the shares for three months and 80 per cent for
the following 21 months. The sale of the 80 per cent of the shares will,
however, be possible within the group of core shareholders.
Core shareholders are expected to include Renault's industrial partners,
such as Elf Aquitaine, the oil group, and Lagardere Group, the electronics
and communications concern. The share sale will take place after a FFr2bn
(Dollars 377m) capital increase.
Overall, the French government plans to reduce its holding in Renault from
80 per cent to just above 50 per cent. The majority of the issue is to go to
individuals and employees of the automobile group.

brewing venture

<TEXT>
Molson, the Canadian brewing, retailing and special chemicals group, is
expected to announce today that it is moving into China with a 'significant
investment'.
Molson Breweries, the brewing unit, is expected to take a stake in a joint
venture established earlier this year by Foster's of Australia and the Hong
Kong conglomerate Wheelock to set up breweries in China, where beer demand
is growing at 20 per cent annually.
Molson Breweries is 40 per cent owned by Molson, 40 per cent by Foster's and
20 per cent by Miller, a unit of Philip Morris of the US.
Molson would not provide details last night, but a spokesman said: 'An
agreement has been signed that is very significant both for China and for
Molson Breweries' future.'
Mr Philip Koven, analyst with Richardson Greenshields Canada in Toronto,
said the deal would be 'very important for Molson Breweries' international
growth, though the results may take some time to show'.
In the first quarter ended June, Molson overall had net profit of CDollars
32.3m (USDollars 24.1m), or 55 cents a share, down 12 per cent from CDollars
36.8m, or 62 cents, a year earlier.
Sales were CDollars 754m against CDollars 772m.
Molson Breweries' sales improved with strong exports to the US but profits
were only slightly higher because of Canadian beer price wars.
Mr Marshall Cohen, president, said earlier this year that Molson would seek
further international brewing expansion.

FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: Nomura buys Slovak fund stake

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nomura Securities has taken a substantial minority stake in VUB Kupon, a
large investment fund in Slovakia, in one of the biggest foreign investments
in the country so far.
VUB Invest, a unit of Vseobecma Uberova Banka which manages the fund, said
Nomura had bought just over 2.9m shares in VUB Kupon from the bank for
Kcs750 each, valuing the transaction at Kcs2.18bn (Dollars 61m) and giving
it a 26 per cent stake in the fund.
The Japanese firm bought its stake from VUB, Slovakia's biggest commercial
bank, after the National Bank of Slovakia ordered it to reduce its holding
from 30 per cent.
Under new banking rules, a Slovak bank cannot own more than 10 per cent of
an investment fund. After the sale the bank owns 4 per cent of VUB Kupon.
Some 300,000 private and institutional Slovak investors own the majority of
its shares.
VUB Kupon was set up during the first wave of voucher privatisation - which
allowed Slovaks to invest in companies being sold off - in the former
Czechoslovakia and is the biggest fund in independent Slovakia, with a
portfolio valued at almost Kcs5bn.
Its shares are traded on the Bratislava stock exchange and are priced at
Kcs500. The fund's net asset value is Kcs1,460.
The fund has substantial stakes in many of Slovakia's industrial companies
which were partly privatised through the voucher system. Many private
investors sold their vouchers to funds such as VUB Kupon, which then used
them to invest in state assets being sold by the government.

FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: Accounts study calls for more
detail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our New York Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US companies should give their shareholders more detailed information about
the performance of different parts of their business, according to a
committee set up by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
The accountants also want companies to include only the results of their
continuing, core operations in their reported net profits, and to identify
exceptional or one-off items separately.
The recommendations are included in a study of financial reporting
undertaken by the AICPA during the past three years and published recently.
It calls for financial statements to include more information about a
company's plans and prospects, as well as touching on several specific
accounting issues.
The call for more detailed segmental information reflects concern from
investors about the quality of information available. 'Users (of financial
reports) tell us it is ineffectual,' said Mr Robert Israeloff, a member of
the committee, who is due to take over as chairman of the AICPA this month.
In the past, companies have always succeeded in fighting off greater
segmental disclosure by arguing that it would reveal commercially sensitive
information.
The AICPA has no power to change accounting rules. However, Mr Israeloff
said the body would urge the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the
Securities and Exchange Commission to adopt the recommendations.

FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: American Express poised to cut
another 4,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
American Express is poised to announce further sweeping job losses in its
core plastic cards business in an attempt to bring itself more into line
with other, more profitable US card companies.
The cuts, which could lead to reductions in the workforce of more than
4,000, will come largely in the US, although the company is also expected to
continue the reorganisation that has been in progress in its European
business since earlier this year. Under this, it has been centring all
activities in London, other than those which have direct contact with
customers.
'We have been for some time looking at our operating costs,' American
Express said yesterday, adding: 'We have not completed those analyses yet,
and have made no decisions.'
However, one source with knowledge of the changes said that they were likely
to be announced as early as this week, adding American Express needs 'fewer
facilities, and functions that work across the organisation'.
The changes in part stem from the group's move to expand its range of cards,
adding a series of revolving credit products to its basic charge card.
Rather than develop separate processing and other systems to handle the new
products, it has decided to redesign its entire operating base to handle all
card products on a single system.
This has created the need to push through a broader-ranging restructuring of
its US operations.
Under Mr Harvey Golub, chairman and chief executive since early last year,
American Express has already been through one wave of cost-cutting. In an
interview earlier this year, though, Mr Golub said that the company, while
switching its focus to growing its revenues, also 'had much more to do' to
bring its costs lower.
American Express's shares rose Dollars  3/8 in New York to close at Dollars
30 1/4.

Motorola, the US electronics and communications manufacturer, has beaten
International Business Machines, its technology partner, to market with
personal computers based on PowerPC microprocessor chips, jointly developed
by the companies and Apple Computer.
Apple introduced its first 'Power Macintosh' computers incorporating the new
microprocessors earlier this year but IBM postponed its range until next
year.
IBM already offers scientific workstations and multi-user computers based on
PowerPC technology.
Motorola yesterday announced a range of PowerPC computers including desktop
models aimed at the PC market, 'servers' which are used to manage networks
of desktop computers, and multi-user computer systems. The launches mark the
first time that Motorola has entered the high-volume PC market with a
system-level product.
The company said it planned to broaden the computer product line with
systems aimed at departmental and enterprise-wide computing over the next
year.
'The Motorola computer group is committed to becoming the premier source of
a full line of computer systems and single board computers based on the
PowerPC microprocessor,' said Mr Karl Stoltze, vice-president of marketing.
The company aims to sell the computers to third parties, most of whom
relabel them, add software and sell on.
Motorola also disclosed technology agreements with IBM to license that
company's AIX (a version of Unix) computer operating system software, and
with Groupe Bull to license its symmetrical multiprocessing technology. Bull
is expected to be one of Motorola's customers for the new line of computers.
The PowerPC microprocessor is more powerful than competing chips from Intel,
say Motorola and IBM. This makes them well suited to demanding desktop
applications such as multimedia with video and graphics.
However, the new chips lack the broad software base available for
Intel-based PCs. It was this lack of software that led IBM to delay the
launch of its PowerPC personal computers.

FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: Baxter sells diagnostic side to
Bain Capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baxter International, the Illinois-based hospital supplies group which
plunged into losses last year after a Dollars 925m restructuring, has agreed
to the sale of its diagnostics business for Dollars 448m.
The business had been put up for sale in November last year as part of a
move by Baxter to reduce borrowings and concentrate its investment in
biotechnology and renal therapy, and to develop its non-US operations.
The company said it had reached agreement to sell the business to Bain
Capital, a Boston-based buy-out firm.
Some Dollars 40m of the consideration will be in the form of preferred
stock, with the remainder in cash and accounts receivable retained by
Baxter.
Baxter said the sale would further reduce its debt levels, and its ratio of
debt to total capital would be 'in the low 40 per cent range' by the end of
this year, compared with 50 per cent at the end of 1993.
The company's shares have recovered almost Dollars 8 from the trough they
hit a year ago, when Baxter was rocked by a temporary US government ban on
accepting bids from the company, and an admission that it had broken US law
by co-operating with an Arab boycott of Israel.

FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: Broader disclosure urged in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our New York Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US companies should give their shareholders more detailed information about
the performance of different parts of their business, according to a
committee set up by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
The accountants also want companies to include only the results of their
continuing, core operations in their reported net profits, and to identify
exceptional or one-off items separately.
The recommendations are included in a study of financial reporting
undertaken by the AICPA during the past three years and published recently.
It calls for financial statements to include more information about a
company's plans and prospects, as well as touching on several specific
accounting issues.
The call for more detailed segmental information reflects concern from
investors about the quality of information available. 'Users (of financial
reports) tell us it is ineffectual,' said Mr Robert Israeloff, a member of
the committee, who is due to take over as chairman of the AICPA this month.
In the past, companies have always succeeded in fighting off greater
segmental disclosure by arguing that it would reveal commercially sensitive
information and therefore be against the interests of their shareholders.
The AICPA has no power to change accounting rules. However, Mr Israeloff
said the body would urge the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the
Securities and Exchange Commission to adopt the recommendations.

FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais share rise
prompts probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French banking group, became embroiled with
regulators yesterday as they examined whether new financial information had
been released exclusively to a small group of analysts.
The probe followed a sharp jump in the price of Credit Lyonnais's shares on
Monday after an analysts' meeting on Friday evening, at which the bank had
appeared to emphasis that the French government would continue to underwrite
past losses.
The Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB), the markets regulatory body,
stressed yesterday it had not launched a formal investigation but confirmed
it had asked for clarification of precisely what the bank had told the
meeting.
It is against COB rules to provide any information to a small group without
providing a public statement to ensure that all investors have equal access
to it.
Mr Jean Peyrelevade, who was appointed chairman of Credit Lyonnais by the
government last year after its troubles emerged, told the analysts that all
bad debts inherited from past management would have no impact on the bank's
accounts from the start of next year.
The clear subtext was that the French state would underwrite whatever
provisions were necessary to keep the bank solvent - with estimates that up
to a further FFr15bn (Dollars 2.84bn) may yet be required on top of the
FFr10.1bn announced last week.
However, Credit Lyonnais maintained that it had sent the same message to all
investors at a press conference to announce its results on Tuesday last
week, when Mr Peyrelevade said that current activities would be protected
against potential losses due to bad risks in the past.
Meanwhile, the ministry of finance and economy reiterated last night that
there was no 'blank cheque' for Credit Lyonnais and that it could not
guarantee support until it had full knowledge of the exact size of
provisions necessary.
Analysts were sticking to their position yesterday.
'Either all analysts are stupid, or Mr Peyrelevade said he had the backing
of the state,' said one yesterday. 'The market is still convinced of this
support, so I think analysts are not completely stupid.'
The bank is in the middle of a public relations offensive following
publication last week of half-year losses of FFr4.5bn.

mines venture

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Asarco, the US mines group, and Coeur d'Alene Mines, the second-largest US
silver producer, are forming a new company, Silver Resources, Reuter reports
from New York.
The new venture will consist of the fully developed Coeur and Galena silver
mines near Wallace, Idaho, as well as the adjoining Caladay, an advanced
silver exploration property.
Asarco and Coeur will each hold a 50 per cent interest in Silver Resources.
The Coeur and Galena mines have been on standby and have not been operating
during the past three years because of low silver prices. Historically, the
two mines have produced more than 160m total ounces of silver.
Asarco has been managing the Galena and Coeur properties under a lease
agreement with Coeur d'Alene.
In forming the new company, both Asarco and Coeur will contribute their
interests in the Galena and the Coeur mines, as well as other assets,
including Coeur's Caladay mine and waive certain cash flow entitlements at
the Galena Mine.
Asarco is contributing the leases it holds in the two mines as well as
buildings and adjacent properties.
Coeur d'Alene Mines will contribute ownership and lease interests in the two
mines as well as the Caladay and other adjacent properties.

FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: Strong sales lift European
operations - The Paris World Auto Show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors' Opel/Vauxhall operations in Europe lifted net profits in the
first six months of 1994 to Dollars 603m from Dollars 520m in the same
period last year.
The half-year figures have already exceeded profits for the whole of 1993,
when the company was burdened by heavy restructuring costs, in particular in
Germany in the second half of the year.
The group also announced that Mr Richard Donnelly had been appointed
president of General Motors Europe, as part of a reorganisation of the top
management of GM's automotive operations.
He will succeed Mr Louis Hughes as head of the Opel/Vauxhall and Saab car
and light commercial vehicle activities. Mr Hughes previously combined this
role with his presidency of all GM's vehicle business outside North America.
Mr Donnelly is head of GM's Powertrain (engines and transmissions)
operations in North America and a member of the GM North American operations
strategy board.
On the results, Mr Hughes said Opel/Vauxhall was the most profitable volume
carmaker in Europe for the fifth year in succession.
Net profits were halved last year, to Dollars 598m from Dollars 1.12bn in
1992, under the impact of a steep decline in west European new car sales.
Mr Hughes said Opel, GM's German subsidiary, had returned to 'solid
profitability' in the first half after falling into loss in 1993, and would
achieve a substantial turnround in the full year.
The Opel/Vauxhall brand (Opel in continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK)
was the top-selling single marque in Europe in the first nine months, with
sales of 1.15m and a 12.5 per cent share of the west European new car
market.
Mr Hughes said Opel had recently added a third shift for the production of
its Omega executive car at its plant in Russelsheim, near Frankfurt. The
move was spurred by strong demand.
GM Europe is entering a new market segment this autumn with the launch of a
small coupe, the Opel/Vauxhall Tigra developed from its Corsa small car,
with planned sales of 50,000 in Europe in 1995.
Mr Hughes forecast that overall new car sales in west Europe would increase
this year by around 5 per cent to 11.8m. However, he admitted that a large
part of the recovery was stemming from government actions in France and
Spain to stimulate sales through financial incentives for scrapping of old
cars.
Sales next year are forecast to recover further to 12.3m, but Mr Hughes
warned they would not return to the record level of 13.45m in 1989-1991
until the 'latter part of this decade'.

FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: Bouygues-led consortium wins
mobile net licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government yesterday announced that a consortium headed by
Bouygues, the construction and communications group, had won the
fiercely-contested and potentially lucrative licence to operate the
country's third mobile telephone network.
The announcement marks the end of a protracted battle between Bouygues and
two other French industrial giants, Alcatel Alsthom, the telecoms and
engineering group, and Lyonnaise des Eaux, the utilities and construction
company.
Bouygues and its consortium partners, which include Cable &amp; Wireless of the
UK, US West, Veba of Germany and Jean-Claude Decaux, a French property
company, will be granted a 15-year licence to operate a national network.
The licence includes a four-year exclusive right to use the DCS 1800 digital
system in five of France's biggest cities, including Paris and Lyon.
The start-up cost of the network is expected to involve an investment of up
to FFr10bn (Dollars 1.9bn) over the next few years. However, industry
observers say the licence is attractive because of the strong growth
potential of the French market.
The French mobile telephone market has been slow to develop, with about
730,000 subscribers at the end of August, compared with 2.7m in the UK and
1.8m in Italy. But the two existing operators of mobile telephone networks,
France Telecom and Generale des Eaux, the utilities group, report rapid
growth in subscribers since the beginning of the year.
The award of the contract marks a significant victory for Bouygues, which is
seeking to diversify from its traditional base in construction and
engineering.
The French industry ministry said it had been hard to separate Bouygues and
Alcatel, but that Alcatel had been disadvantaged by a few considerations,
including its position as a supplier to the existing operators.
The French industry ministry sought to defuse criticism of the award process
by allowing the defeated consortia to consult the recommendations by the
managing director of the post and telecommunications authority. The ministry
said the offers from the rival groups would be made public, except for where
industrial secrets were compromised.
The sensitivity of the award stemmed from the closed nature of the selection
process and political considerations. In particular, some observers claimed
that Bouygues' controlling stake in TF1, the country's largest television
station, gave it an advantage in view of the presidential elections
scheduled for next spring.
According to the industry ministry, the operation of the licence is
conditional on the maintenance of a stable shareholding structure.

FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: Peugeot Citroen in cost-cut
drive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peugeot Citroen, the French carmaker, is seeking to cut costs substantially
in order to increase its international competitiveness, Mr Jacques Calvet,
chairman, said yesterday.
The target was to reduce purchasing costs by 15 per cent and investment
costs by 30 per cent during the next three years.
The Peugeot group staged a strong recovery in the first half this year, with
a pre-tax profit of FFr1.02bn (Dollars 192m) compared with a loss of
FFr1.85bn in the same period a year ago.
The group is aiming to improve productivity in its plants by more than 12
per cent this year, having achieved a similar increase in both 1992 and
1993.
The target of cutting investment costs by 30 per cent in the next three
years while maintaining the same overall level of spending would allow the
group to accelerate its product development programme.
Mr Calvet said Peugeot was also seeking to reduce significantly the time
taken to develop new vehicles. New projects started in the next two years
would cut development times from 44 to 36 months, while the costs of
producing prototype vehicles would be cut by 10 per cent a year.
The carmaker, which is largely dependent on the European market, is also
determined to increase its presence in overseas markets.
Mr Calvet said the group's target was to generate 25 per cent of its sales
outside Europe by the year 2000, compared with only 14 per cent last year.
It sold 75,000 vehicles in South America last year, was advancing in China
and had good prospects in Malaysia and India.
Mr Calvet ruled out any suggestion of a merger with Renault.

Suez, the French financial services and investment group, yesterday
announced profits of FFr795m (Dollars 149.7m) for the first half of 1994, up
54 per cent on the same period last year.
The result included an exceptional gain of FFr317m, compared with FFr381m
last time, which the group said also took into account losses realised on
the disposal of Groupe Victoire, the insurance company sold to Commercial
Union of the UK earlier this year.
These losses - as well as other provisions - were offset by various
exceptional gains, including the sale of its shares in Compagnie Fonciere
Internationale to Unibail earlier this year. Operating profits more than
doubled, to FFr478m compared with FFr135m in the first half last year, and
full-year 1993 operating losses of FFr1.3bn.
The company said the rise reflected the solid performance of subsidiaries
against a background of difficult markets and banking conditions and heavy
property provisions.

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Huhtamaki, the Finnish consumer products group, has lowered its full-year
forecast after reporting static profits and lower earnings per share in the
first eight months.
The sales prognosis has been cut by FM500m to FM8.5bn (Dollars 1.8bn) and
earnings per share are expected to be lower than last year's FM13.59, not
higher. Pre-tax profits will be flat at around FM506m.
The company blamed a 15 per cent rise in the Finnish markka against the US
dollar for the adjustment, and said a strike in North America's major league
baseball may hit collectable card launches towards the year-end.
In the first eight months, profits edged up to FM309m from FM307m after
acquisitions helped lift sales by 12 per cent to FM5.6bn.
The result, struck after a FM4m increase in operating profit, to FM409m, was
partially offset by higher financial costs of FM100m, up FM2m. Earnings per
share fell 12 per cent to FM8.46 from FM9.58 due to a higher number of
shares in issue.
Mr Timo Peltola, chief executive, was cautiously optimistic, saying 'a
turnaround in our key markets is evident at long last'. There was an
improved North American performance by Leaf, the world's 10th largest
confectionery group, and satisfactory results from Leiras pharmaceuticals.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lagardere Group, the diversified French defence and electronics group,
yesterday announced that it planned to sell its 26 per cent stake in SAT,
the telecoms equipment and electronics company.
According to Lagardere, the sale of the stake, which is valued at about
FFr1bn (Dollars 188m), will bring a capital gain of FFr500m. The company
said the proceeds supported its prediction of a strong rise in profits this
year.
Earlier this year, Lagardere said it would report a double-digit percentage
increase in net profits compared with about FFr500m in 1993. The comparison
is complicated by the changed accounting structure following Lagardere's
increased holding in its Matra-Hachette subsidiary this year.
A spokesman for Lagardere said that the sale of its stake in SAT had been
agreed with Sagem, which controls the majority of SAT's shares. It said the
sale would take place soon, depending on stock market conditions, and that
it would comprise a public offer and an institutional placing, to be managed
by Banque Nationale de Paris.
Lagardere said the sale was in line with its strategy of disposing of
non-core assets.

unit assets

<TEXT>
Peabody Holding Company, the US coal mining subsidiary of Hanson of the UK,
is to buy the assets of Exxon Coal's Carter Mining Company for Dollars 360m
in cash.
The purchase will double Peabody's holdings in Wyoming's Powder River Basin,
which is known for its low-sulphur, clean-burning coal.
The acquisition is strategically important for Peabody, which in recent
years has sought to increase its ownership of clean coal reserves while
ensuring cash flow by purchasing properties that come with long-term coal
supply agreements.
Long-term sales of more than 255m tons are covered by coal supply agreements
included in the transaction.
Hanson said 90 per cent of the 25m tons of coal produced last year at
Exxon's Wyoming mines was sold to electric utilities under contracts of
between five and 15 years.
Peabody is acquiring Exxon's Rawhide and Caballo mines, which together have
888m tons of economically recoverable reserves, and another 400m tons of
unclassified reserves. Peabody, through its Powder River Coal Company
subsidiary, already owns about 1.2bn tons of Wyoming coal reserves.
As well as the coal reserves and long-term supply agreements, Peabody is
acquiring mines and equipment with net asset value of Dollars 170m.
None of the mines included in the deal are unionised. A prolonged coal
strike by the United Mineworkers union hit Peabody's eastern coal operations
last year.
The Caballo mine lost Dollars 1.1m in the first half of this year, largely
due to problems with a new excavator. Peabody plans to abandon the machine,
and institute less expensive procedures at its own mines in the area.
Mr Larry Metzroth, senior economist with Resource Data International, a
Colorado-based coal consulting firm, said Exxon 'got a very good price' for
the mines.

The company said that no decision had yet been made on a production
location, but it is understood that the plant at Valencia, Spain, is front

FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: GM shakes up senior management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors has announced a shake-up of senior executives in its core
North American operations, in a move intended in part to recognise the
successes of its Saturn small car division.
The reshuffle brings two executives to the fore: Mr Richard 'Skip' LeFauve,
head of Saturn, who has been given responsibility for all small cars in
North America; and Mr Donald Hackworth, who will run the medium-sized and
luxury car businesses.
Mr Richard Wagoner, who became president of GM's North American operations
this summer, said there were 'a lot of good ideas in Saturn that need to
spread across the company', though he added that 'the flow will not be
one-way'.
Saturn accounts for some 300,000 of the 3m cars that GM produces in North
America each year, compared with the 1m vehicles produced by its other small
cars division, the Lansing Automotive Division.
The company said its North American car operations would continue to be run
as four separate divisions, and that it was not making any changes to its
product lines. Mr Wagoner said no specific cost savings were projected as
result of the shake-up.
The move comes as production at the US's biggest automotive group continues
to pick up after a strike at a parts plant in Michigan, which brought
several production lines to a halt last week.
The strike ended when GM agreed to demands from the United Auto Workers
union to hire more staff at the plant to reduce the overtime load on the
existing 11,000 workers.
Mr Wagoner said yesterday that settlement of the dispute did not mean GM
would give in to demands for extra staff at other sites. The company looked
at staffing levels plant by plant, and had settled other similar issues
without adding to staff levels, he said.
Mr Wagoner characterised the latest strike as a symptom of expanding demand
in the US, which had caused 'bottlenecks' at various points in the
production and distribution chain.
'Clearly, we are hitting some rough spots,' he said. The question for the
GM's management, he added, was: 'How do you manage the upside, while leaving
the company prepared for any future downturn?'

FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Midlands Electric buys back 10% of its
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Midlands Electricity bought back 10 per cent of its shares for Pounds 153.5m
yesterday, following the well-established practice among electricity
utilities.
The buy-back, carried out by Cazenove, the company's stockbrokers, was
undertaken to increase earnings per share, Midlands said. Shareholder
approval was obtained at the annual meeting in August.
The buy-back of 21m shares was made at an average price of 725p. The shares
closed up 13p at 714p as other electricity stocks also gained strongly.
As with a recent buy-back by Northern Electric, the deal was structured in a
way that should enable institutional investors to treat the proceeds as a
distribution qualifying for a tax credit. But Midlands said it was up to
individual investors to negotiate the credits with the Inland Revenue.

Pacific which recently acquired UK chocolate maker Meltis, moved from a
Pounds 745,000 loss to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 203,000 for the six months
to June 30.

Pounds 144,000 (Pounds 500,000 loss) to give earnings per share of 0.36p
(1.27p loss).
There was a contribution of Pounds 273,000 from Network Foods, which was
listed on the Australian stock exchange in January.
NFL announced a maiden interim of 2 cents; there is again no dividend from

FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Watts Blake seeks German buys - Last year's
figures restated to take account of errors at United Clays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watts Blake Bearne &amp; Co yesterday outlined details of a acquisition strategy
designed to strengthen its position as the world's largest producer of
specialist clays.
The Devon-based company, which mines ball and china clays for ceramic
manufacturers, said it was discussing possible takeovers with a number of
competitors in Germany, its largest market.
Although talks are at an early stage, the group is keen to exploit the
dominance of Fuchs-Ton, its German subsidiary, which already extracts 1.2m
tonnes of clay a year.
Mr John Pike, managing director, said the moves had been backed by Sibelco,
the privately-owned Belgian company, which has a 47.6 per cent shareholding
and last year mounted a hostile takeover bid for the group.
'An acquisition would help us reduce competition and strengthen our market
position in Germany,' he said.
Mr Pike declined to reveal the total gains at Fuchs-Ton, but he admitted
that aggressive price competition had sliced Pounds 400,000 off the
division's half year profits. Trading was affected by the strength of the
D-Mark.
Nevertheless, rising UK sales and exports outside Europe helped lift pre-tax
profits by 24 per cent to Pounds 5.13m in the six months to June 30, against
Pounds 4.14m.
The improvement was flattered by Pounds 475,000 of exceptional items last
time incurred fighting Sibelco's now lapsed takeover bid and the downward
restatement of last year's results to take account of 'serious accounting
errors' at United Clays, the US subsidiary.
Last year's interim profits were reduced by Pounds 118,000 and the full year
figures by Pounds 235,000 to Pounds 7.71m. The division's chief financial
officer has been replaced.
The group improvement was underpinned by increased profits at Devon Clays,
the largest division, which saw sales rise from Pounds 18.1m to Pounds
20.8m, accounting for half the group total of Pounds 41.8m (Pounds 39.3m).
In the US sales volumes improved with higher sales to Mexico offsetting
lower figures to the US and Canada.
Earnings per share rose from 12.2p to 16p and the interim dividend is lifted
to 3.9p (3.5p).
COMMENT
If Watts is looking for short term gains, it had better think again about
Germany. Some of Fuchs-Ton's rivals may be willing to sell, but in a
sluggish market the rewards will be a long time coming. Questions also
remain over Sibelco's role in such a deal. The Belgians are close to
majority control and are unlikely to back a dilutive acquisition. However,
the modest 9 per cent gearing gives it room for manoeuvre and improvements
at Devon Clays should lift full year profits to about Pounds 9.7m. The
shares, which closed up 3p at 545p, look pricey on a forward multiple of 18,
although they offer safer long-term value.

With pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.41m, Johnston Group, the construction and
civil engineering company, was back in the black at the end of the six
months to June 30. Last year's losses were Pounds 393,000 at interim stage,
Pounds 2.6m at the year-end.
Turnover increased 5 per cent to Pounds 67.7m (Pounds 64.2m).
Losses at Johnston Construction were much reduced, but it had 'some way to
go' before providing a satisfactory return, the company said.
California-based Johnson Sweeper Company was taking longer to break even
than planned. However, improved turnover and margins led to increased
profits in the construction materials division.
Earnings per share were 12.91p compared with losses of 4.62p. The
recommended interim dividend is 3.5p (1p).

FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Travel losses push CSI down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Cannon Street Investments fell from 26 1/2 p to close at 15 1/2 p
yesterday after the mini-conglomerate revealed a decline in operating profit
for the 28 weeks to July 16 and failed to announce its long-awaited debt
restructuring and acquisition package.
The group said substantial losses from its travel business had reduced
pre-tax profits from a restated Pounds 4.83m to Pounds 217,000. The figure
last time, however, included Pounds 4.32m profit from disposals.
Turnover fell to Pounds 87m (Pounds 99.6m) while trading profit from
continuing business was sharply lower at Pounds 1.33m (Pounds 2.88m). The
company had been forecast to make Pounds 7m for the full year.
It had also been expected to combine the announcement with details of an
acquisition, which will almost certainly require shareholder funding and the
restructuring of the Pounds 25.7m preference shares held by the Bank of
Scotland. This package is now likely to be revealed at the end of October.
Profits from the core electronics business declined from Pounds 3.25m to
Pounds 2.72m. However, Altai, which accounted for about 60 per cent of the
division's profits, experienced strong growth in its European markets, where
sales volumes rose by 35 per cent. Any acquisition is likely to be aimed at
building on the strength of this core business.
Food and drink distribution contributed Pounds 553,000 (Pounds 323,000), but
the hotels and leisure operations lost Pounds 975,000 (Pounds 86,000) after
a Pounds 800,000 loss from Cotsworld Travel. The division is expected to be
profitable in the second half.
Losses per share were 1.41p (3.01p earnings).
Outstanding preference dividends amount to Pounds 4.48m, and the company
cannot fund acquisitions, or resume dividends, until the preference shares
are restructured.

FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Lower interest charge helps Boosey &amp; Hawkes
to Pounds 1.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fall in interest payments helped Boosey &amp; Hawkes, the instrument maker and
music publisher, to report higher interim profits yesterday.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of June were ahead at Pounds
1.5m, against Pounds 1.41m. At the operating level, however, profits eased
from Pounds 2.41m to Pounds 2.34m.
Group turnover was 15 per cent ahead at Pounds 33.8m (Pounds 29.4m). Almost
Pounds 2m of the increase was contributed by Karl Hofner, the German
stringed instrument maker acquired for Pounds 390,000 last January.
Mr Richard Holland, chief executive, said the increase in total turnover
'demonstrates that we are starting to recover from the effect of recession.'
The flatness of the operating profits mainly reflected the lack of
contribution from Hofner, exchange rates, and the effects of a change in
royalties distribution.
Group margins were still recovering, Mr Holland said.
The company had been going for volume in order to keep its factories busy
and reduce stocks. 'Now we will be going for margins,' he added.
The instrument division, which accounts for almost 80 per cent of sales, saw
strong growth in the US and some parts of Europe. But sales to Japan - about
20 per cent of the group's market - remained flat.
The group is not expecting profits from Hofner to come on stream until next
year. Stringed instrument making is being consolidated from three sites to
one site in southern Germany.
The publishing division, which includes Rakhmaninov, Britten and Stravinsky
on its books, increased its market share. Royalties were flat, but are
expected to improve in the second half.
Net borrowings were reduced from Pounds 21m to Pounds 20.3m, and would have
been down a further Pounds 1.2m but for the Hofner acquisition. Interest
payable fell from Pounds 999,000 to Pounds 839,000.
Earnings per share rose from 3.7p to 4.16p. The interim dividend is raised
to 1.32p (1.2p).

FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Courtaulds Textiles in Chinese joint
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Courtaulds Textiles, the clothing and fabrics group, yesterday announced its
first move into China with the formation of a joint venture to produce
knitted fabrics.
The move follows 18 months of exploratory visits and talks with officials in
Jiangsu Province, the centre for the country's textile industry.
Under the joint venture agreement, Courtaulds will invest Dollars 20m
(Pounds 12.6m) over three years in Penn China - a new manufacturing company
based in Nanjing, the provincial capital some 150 miles from Shanghai.
Although other UK textile companies have embarked on similar schemes, Mr
Noel Jervis, chief executive, claimed it was the first deal involving
stretch fabrics.
'Penn China will knit, dye and finish fabric for the lingerie and automotive
trim markets both in China and for export,' he said.
Courtaulds will hold 85 per cent of the shares, with the remainder retained
by Jiangsu Provincial Textiles Bureau.
The venture is expected to strengthen the company's foothold in south-east
Asia, where it already has operations in Thailand and the Philippines.
If successful, Mr Jervis said the company would consider investing a further
Dollars 20m in a lace manufacturing plant.

FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Silentnight lower after downturn in UK beds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tough market competition depressed interim profits at Silentnight Holdings,
Europe's biggest bed manufacturer.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to end-July fell from Pounds 5.22m to
Pounds 4.11m. The latest figure was struck after reorganisation costs of
Pounds 592,000 for the closure of the group's Sutton bed factory announced
last April.
Mr Bill Davies, executive chairman, described the performance of the UK beds
business as disappointing. There was no sign of recovery and price
competition remained intense.
However, the German bed and UK cabinet businesses had performed well, and
the US division returned to profit.
Group sales improved from Pounds 79.6m to Pounds 82.5m.
The UK beds division, which continues to contribute the bulk of turnover,
reported sales of Pounds 47m (Pounds 47.9m) and operating profits, after
taking the reorganisation charge, halved to Pounds 1.51m (Pounds 3.27m).
The group expects the consolidation of bed production on its Barnoldswick
site to bring annual cost savings of Pounds 750,000.
In contrast, the UK cabinets division lifted operating profits by 24 per
cent, from Pounds 1.17m to Pounds 1.45m, on sales up from Pounds 19.8m to
Pounds 22.3m. Mr Davies said the improvements had been made in spite of the
flat market for furniture.
The capital expenditure of 18 months ago had led to a good product range,
and increasing volume would drop profits straight through to the bottom
line.
The German beds division made operating profits of Pounds 635,000 on sales
of Pounds 6.44m, down from Pounds 737,000 on sales of Pounds 6.28m.
In the US, where new management was installed last year, a previous loss of
Pounds 14,000 on sales of Pounds 5.1m was turned into a profit of Pounds
341,000 on sales of Pounds 6.36m.
Earnings per share fell from 7.41p to 5.84p, while the interim dividend is
maintained at 2.75p.
COMMENT
Not before time, the group has given a divisional breakdown. It makes clear
that the biggest problem remains the UK bed market, where margins are under
pressure. While this division performed worse than expected, the cabinets
division rode to the rescue, and the US climbed back into the black.
Forecasting the profits for the bed division is difficult - the absence of
exceptionals and the ensuing savings should lead to a Pounds 1.5m turnround,
but the continuing effects of disruption are harder to quantify. Prices of
raw materials, which account for 50 per cent of a bed, are also set to rise,
with an 8 per cent increase expected in imported timber. Analysts yesterday
reduced forecasts to about Pounds 11m this year and between Pounds 12.4m and
Pounds 13.5m for 1995-96. The upper figure gives a prospective multiple of
10.9 - high enough.

FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Lower costs help margins rise at VCI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VCI, one of the UK's largest independent publishers of videos and
pre-recorded music, yesterday reported an 18 per cent rise in operating
profits in its first interim results since flotation.
Shares lifted 1p to the issue price of 150p after the company announced
operating profits of Pounds 1.01m (Pounds 856,000) on turnover of Pounds
23.3m (Pounds 23.5m) for the six months to June 30.
Mr Ivan Dunleavy, finance director, said improved margins were the result of
reduced manufacturing costs and increased sales of higher-priced products.
The company has also concentrated on its own video productions, which cut
royalty payments.
VCI, whose video rights include 'Thomas the Tank Engine' and 'Mr Bean', is
now marketing a range of CD-video titles and budget price computer software.
Its flotation in June raised about Pounds 28m net to clear Pounds 25.1m of
debt after a management buy-out in 1989. Interim net interest costs fell to
Pounds 944,000 (Pounds 1.96m) and the company is now ungeared.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 4.03m to Pounds 67,000, following a Pounds
5.15m redemption of debenture last year. However, a pro forma calculation
reveals pre-tax profits of Pounds 938,000 (Pounds 370,000).
Earnings per share fell to 0.3p (70.6p), although pro forma earnings rose to
2p (0.6p). There is no interim dividend, in line with the company's listing
particulars.

FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Raine shares fall 12% as Pounds 13.1m slips
below forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Raine fell 12 per cent to 57p yesterday as the housebuilding and
construction group reported annual profits at the bottom of market
expectations.
It also made cautious comments over its US housing and UK contracting
businesses.
Although pre-tax profits advanced 21.6 per cent to Pounds 13.14m (Pounds
10.81m) for the year to June 30, City analysts had been forecasting profits
towards Pounds 13.5m.
Turnover showed little growth, coming out only 2 per cent ahead at Pounds
456.5m (Pounds 446.2m).
UK housebuilding provided the main source of profits.
It increased by 30 per cent to Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 12.6m) at the operating
level, on turnover 2 per cent up at Pounds 206.79m (Pounds 202.29m).
The number of houses sold by the group's Hassall Homes division rose by 7
per cent to 1,985.
The average selling price also rose, from Pounds 68,020 in 1993 to Pounds
70,220. The company is forecasting an increase to Pounds 80,000 in 1995,
although this would in part reflect a move towards building more 'middle
market homes'.
Hall &amp; Tawse, which provides housing to local authorities, increased its
completions rate by 23 per cent to 1,329 homes.
Mr Peter Parkin, chairman, said the contracting market had been squeezed by
higher supplier prices and industry overcapacity.
This had put intense pressure on margins.
'We believe we are at the bottom of the cycle and expect some recovery to
show through to the balance sheet in 1996,' he said.
Operating profits declined from Pounds 1.18m to Pounds 429,000 on turnover
up 2 per cent to Pounds 249.7m (Pounds 243.9m).
The company was also taking steps to shed its Californian housebuilding
business. Mr Parkin said investment in the region of Dollars 10m-Dollars 15m
would be required over the next two or three years in order to make it more
saleable. He expected it to fetch in excess of its net assets of Dollars
55m.
Earnings per share rose from 4.34p to 4.66p. The final dividend is 2p (1p),
maintaining a total dividend of 3p.
COMMENT
Given the continued difficulties in its UK contracting and Californian
businesses, Raine is looking to its UK housebuilding business to grow
profits. But here, too, a sprightly start to the year has been marked by a
slowdown in sales, particularly since the latest rise in interest rates. The
market's fearful response to this prognosis left the shares trailing at 57p
yesterday. The high yield and a net asset value of 64p should provide some
support from here. But the upside looks equally limited. On a prospective
eps of 6.4p for 1996, the shares are on a p/e of nine times, at a discount
to the market but well ahead of the likes of Barratt and Beazer.

Shares in Upton &amp; Southern slipped  1/2 p yesterday to 7p when the
department store group announced it was considering raising additional
equity capital.
In February, it bought Reject Shop, the furniture and household goods chain,
for Pounds 2.5m in an all-paper deal. In August, Upton announced that the
financial and trading position of Reject Shop was materially worse than had
been represented at the time of the recommended offer, resulting in a Pounds
2.75m cash shortfall. About one third of the stock Upton expected in Reject
Shop was found not to be there.
It said it was considering legal action not only against some former
directors of the Reject Shop, but also against its own financial advisers.

British Building &amp; Engineering Appliances, which was demerged from BM in
October last year, reported a 9 per cent advance in pre-tax profits for the
year to June 30.
Mr Robert Paine, chairman, said it had been an encouraging start for the
newly independent group and was in line with expectations when BM placed its
75 per cent holding.
He added that the group was experiencing patchy improvements in the economy,
but it had been getting increased orders and work in hand was now 40 per
cent higher than last year. The shares however, fell 5p to 195p.
Turnover advanced to Pounds 50.6m (Pounds 43.4m) of which Pounds 1.17m
(Pounds 2.7m) related to discontinued activities. Turnover showed an
underlying improvement of 21 per cent. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 2.51m
(Pounds 2.31m) after higher net interest charges of Pounds 522,000 (Pounds
440,000).
Earnings per share came out at 16.7p (14.2p) and an unchanged final dividend
of 5.5p is proposed for a same-again total of 8p.

Shepherd Neame, the Kent brewer, reported an 8.6 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 4.71m to Pounds 5.11m in the year to July 2 as its
Bishops Finger and Spitfire brands gained from national distribution and
strong export sales, writes Roderick Oram.
Turnover advanced 12 per cent from Pounds 39.1m to Pounds 43.8m. Earnings
per share were 60.2p (54.4p) and a final proposed dividend of 15p makes a
total of 19p (17.5p).
The Kent pubs suffered from cross-Channel duty-free imports but any decline
was more than offset by strong sales of Bishops Finger in Calais stores, Mr
Bobby Neame, chairman, said.

FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: BAe confirms VSEL bid talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace has finally confirmed that it is seeking to negotiate a
'recommended offer' for VSEL, the submarine maker.
British Aerospace's announcement of discussions follows five days of
speculation over the deal; but advisers said the company was anxious to
ensure there was a firm basis to negotiations before they were made public.
The company was also under considerable pressure from the Stock Exchange to
make a statement. Shares in VSEL rose 17p to 1195p on the news that
negotiations were moving forward, and a final announcement could be made
before the week-end.
British Aerospace is aiming to become a major defence contractor on land,
sea and air, but thus far its sea activities have been restricted to weapons
systems rather than shipbuilding. The company clearly reckons that its
expertise in defence contracting and systems integration could help VSEL win
the next Ministry of Defence contracts for Trafalgar Class submarines.
An added attraction is VSEL's cash holding of around Pounds 320m, which
would provide welcome support for a group which suffered a Pounds 115m
operating cash outflow in the first half of 1994.
The Ministry of Defence, which is a key party to negotiations as both VSEL's
major customer and holder of a golden share in its shipbuilding operations,
has been briefed on progress. British Aerospace is confident a deal would be
approved.
The negotiations are being handled by Kleinwort Benson, for British
Aerospace, and Morgan Grenfell.
So far there has been no approach from an obvious alternative buyer, GEC.
Analysts said GEC was unlikely to emerge from the background until a price
was agreed, or unless talks collapse.

FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Ibstock back in profit at Pounds 4.4m -
Recovery in key markets allowed price increases to be passed on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The slow recovery in the UK building market helped Ibstock, Britain's third
biggest brick maker, move back into the black for the first six months of
the year, reporting pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.36m against losses of Pounds
17.1m.
There were also improvements in the US building material business, with
brick demand also picking up, and in the international pulp market.
Mr Ian Maclellan, managing director, said the recovery in Ibstock's key
markets had enabled it to pass on price increases successfully. 'We expect
further modest price increases in bricks in the region of 5 to 6 per cent
next year, although they have some way to go to recover pre-recession
levels,' he added.
Mr Cohn Hope, chairman, struck a note of caution. He said: 'We anticipate
the steady improvement in demand to continue into 1995, although the
essential increases in price that are required to achieve improved margins
may be slower to materialise.'
Turnover declined 32 per cent to Pounds 96.9m (Pounds 141.8m), although
1993's interim figure was inflated by contributions from discontinued
businesses of Pounds 48.5m. On continuing operations, turnover advanced 4
per cent from Pounds 93.3m.
Operating profits from the UK brick business more than tripled from Pounds
1.14m to Pounds 3.9m on turnover 11 per cent ahead at Pounds 33.5m (Pounds
30m). The US operations had profits of Pounds 826,000 against losses of
Pounds 509,000, having returned to the black at the year-end.
However, tough trading conditions in the Portuguese building market turned
profits of Pounds 424,000 into losses of Pounds 287,000. Turnover slid 19
per cent to Pounds 7.11m (Pounds 8.83m). Higher pulp prices helped the
forestry products business move into the black, operating profits of Pounds
1.07m being reported against losses of Pounds 2.9m. Prices increased from
Dollars 400 to Dollars 600 a tonne in the last year.
Earnings per share were 1.13p (losses of 4.93p). The dividend is maintained
at 0.5p. Net debt fell from Pounds 35.6m at the year-end to Pounds 29.4m,
mainly due to the sale of Ibstock's 20 per cent stake in a Portuguese pulp
company, raising Pounds 7.95m.
COMMENT
The higher pulp prices and encouraging brick margins which enabled Ibstock
to move back into the black reflect its current position in the recovery
cycle. Full-year profits of around Pounds 12m would put the stock on a hefty
premium to the market, although this falls as the recovery comes through
into 1995's earnings. Profits of around Pounds 21.5m then would give
earnings of 5.6p, a p/e of 14, a 10 per cent premium to the market and a
slight premium to the sector. A justified rating in its present position,
although whether the improvement in margins continues will depend largely on
whether recovery in the housing market is sustained.

FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Fabrics side underpins 39% growth at Lamont
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A successful performance from the fabrics and fabric printing division
underpinned a 39 per cent pre-tax profits increase at Lamont Holdings, the
Northern Ireland-based textiles group, in the first half of 1994.
However, that success was a sharp counterpoint to the troubles the group
experienced in the carpet and carpet yarn division, which swung into the red
at the operating level. Lamont's shares eased 4p to 333p.
Group pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 5.62m (Pounds 4.05m) on turnover 8 per
cent ahead at Pounds 71m (Pounds 65.8m). Within those figures, operating
profits from the fabrics side grew 52 per cent to Pounds 6.39m (Pounds 4.2m)
on turnover up 33 per cent at Pounds 43.2m (Pounds 32.6m), while the carpets
side fell into losses of Pounds 437,000 (profits Pounds 561,000) on turnover
down Pounds 2m at Pounds 26.9m.
Mr Dick Milliken, chief executive, said that the maintenance of gross
margins at 27.4 per cent masked an underlying pressure on group margins. On
carpets they were down about 2 points, and the half under review included
Cunningham Johnson, the fabric printer bought in October 1993 and now
consolidated into Alexander Drew.
Since June, Lamont has bought for Pounds 500,000 a linen weaving operation
in Estonia. Sir Desmond Lorimer, chairman, said it was an exciting prospect
'if we can make it work'.
Sir Desmond the recovery was 'hesitating, rather than progressing',
impacting adversely on the carpets side. Although Northern Ireland Carpets,
the downmarket manufacturer, remained resilient and in profit, Shaw Carpets
in Barnsley was likely to incur greater losses this year than 1993's Pounds
2m.
Deciding against closure because of the previous Pounds 4m investment on the
backing plant, Shaw is to be 'brought into line with current market activity
levels'. This, Sir Desmond said, would cost Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m this year
and would involve about 150 job losses out of the 350 total.
Borrowings at June 30 were about Pounds 14m (Pounds 9m) and, after expected
capital expenditure of Pounds 17m for the year, would total about Pounds 28m
at the year-end.
Earnings rose to 12.6p (10.62p) per share and the interim dividend is lifted
to 3.65p (3.5p).

FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Asda Property up to Pounds 4.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading profits from sales of residential property helped Asda Property
Holdings to increase pre-tax profits for the six months to end-June from
Pounds 2.47m to Pounds 4.43m.
Profit from trading properties rose by Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 2.5m in the
period, the bulk of which came from sales of residential investments. The
company's remaining residential portfolio amounts to Pounds 3m and will be
sold in the near term.
Net rental income was Pounds 6.3m, up from Pounds 5.2m, reflecting
acquisitions made in the second half of last year and lettings of vacant
property.
Interest charges rose from Pounds 2.88m to Pounds 3.15m, but last year's
figure included Pounds 300,000 capitalised interest. This year's charge
reflects the one-off Pounds 300,000 cost of unwinding interest rate swaps.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 15m (Pounds 11.2m). Earnings per share were 3.4p
(2.5p) and the interim dividend is increased to 0.75p (0.7p).
Asda was a net seller of property in the first half, disposing of Pounds 10m
assets against purchases totalling Pounds 3.5m. Mr Tony Roscoe, managing
director, said that prices being sought in spring and early summer were
unrealistic, but that the market had slipped back since the summer and Asda
had again started to buy.
Since the half-year end, the company has spent Pounds 17m, including Pounds
8.5m on a portfolio of 28 shops acquired from a high street retailer and
Pounds 3.9m in a half share of a retail warehouse park in Cwmbran, South
Wales.
Mr Roscoe said that the retail portfolio required active management. Some of
the shops would be refurbished and retained, while others would be sold.

FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Fiscal buys properties in Croydon for
Pounds 17.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fiscal Properties, the investment and development company which floated on
the Stock Exchange in April, yesterday announced a Pounds 17.5m acquisition
of office and retail properties in Croydon, south London.
The company also reported a Pounds 562,000 pre-tax loss for the six months
to the end of June, against a Pounds 164,000 profit. The result includes
Pounds 990,000 non-recurring costs relating to flotation.
Turnover increased from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 4.5m and operating profit from
Pounds 1m to Pounds 1.8m. The interim dividend is 0.624p.
Fiscal is buying 47.5 per cent of Croydon Land and Estates from Montagu
Private Equity, the private equity arm of Midland Bank. CLE was set up
earlier this year to acquire the commercial property portfolio of the London
Borough of Croydon, comprising 156 properties generating rental income of
around Pounds 4.1m.
Directors of Fiscal already have an interest in 4 per cent of CLE. Montagu
Private Equity, one of the founding shareholders, still holds a 35 per cent
stake in Fiscal.
To avoid conflicts of interest, the terms of the transaction were negotiated
by Fiscal's non-executive directors.
The deal marks Fiscal's first move away from buildings occupied by
government.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Templeton predicts strong growth in Russian markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The size of Russia's capital markets could match those of the US within 20
years, one of the world's leading emerging markets specialists predicted
yesterday.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Mark Mobius, president of the
Templeton Emerging Markets Fund, which manages Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.8bn) of
assets, said: 'I would rank Russia very highly among emerging markets
because of its size and its potential. In the next two decades it is quite
possible that Russian capital markets could be as big as (those) in the US.'
Mr Mobius is the latest in a string of western fund managers to highlight
the attraction of Russia's surging equity markets. Many have a clear vested
interest in so doing, but Mr Mobius may deserve to be taken more seriously
given the performance of the Templeton Fund, which has produced an
annualised rate of return on its original capital of 30 per cent since 1987.
The Templeton Fund is opening an office in Moscow and is contemplating
launching a Russian country fund of about Dollars 300m. 'I have got about
Dollars 1bn sitting in the bank, as 20 per cent to 30 per cent of our money
is in cash at the moment,' he said.
Mr Mobius said Russia's vast natural resource base and mass privatisation
programme had created an exciting investment climate. The possible
appreciation of the rouble provided an additional attraction.
'But the reason I came here was, that this was a country which produced
Tchaikovsky and which put people on the moon. These are impressive people,'
he said.
On a 10-year basis Russia might represent as much as 20 per cent of the
Templeton Fund's weighting while Hong Kong and China might represent about
15 per cent, but he added: 'Russia is potentially a much more explosive
investment climate.'
Mr Mobius conceded there were risks in investing in Russia: companies do not
yet produce reliable audited financial statements; managers have little
concept of shareholder accountability; the share trading environment is
chaotic; and there is a danger that a future government might renationalise
assets. 'But in emerging markets we must seek out risk which has an inverse
relationship to reward,' he said.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president, yesterday reaffirmed the government's
commitment to creating a more favourable investment climate. 'We need to
create an organised market for share trading,' he said yesterday.
But earlier in the week, Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former finance minister,
warned that a 'catastrophic situation' was developing in Russia's share
markets because of a lack of effective regulation and the growing threat of
organised crime.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Hambros warns of sharp profits fall: Merchant bank hurt by
downturn in bond market - 'No hedging is perfect'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hambros yesterday followed SG Warburg in warning of a sharp fall in profits
in the six months to September 30 because of a deterioration in securities
markets.
The merchant bank forecast that its interim pre-tax profit would fall to
Pounds 18m-Pounds 23m from Pounds 41.1m in the first half of the 1993-94
financial year.
Although Hambros said it would maintain its interim dividend at 4.5p, its
announcement further drove down share prices in a sector already hit by
Warburg's profit warning on Monday.
Hambros itself, which fell 11p on Warburg's news, lost another 22p to close
at 226p.
Schroders, another merchant bank, ended the day at 1285p, down 50p over one
day and down 93p over two. Warburg made up some of the ground it lost on
Monday but still closed 90p down over two days at 580p.
Hambros blamed the deterioration in first-half results in part on the
downturn in the bond market that has already affected Warburg and several US
investment banks.
Sir Chips Keswick, joint deputy chairman, said he was 'delighted' that the
company had maintained profitability in the bond business in the first half.
He said Hambros had experienced lower profit margins in primary bond issues.
It had not been able to use derivatives to hedge all its positions in the
secondary bond market against price movements. 'No hedging is perfect,' he
said.
Sir Chips said Hambros had no immediate plans to shed many employees or to
reconsider its involvement in bond markets. 'I am certainly not going to
rush off and fire people at the wrong end of the cycle,' said Sir Chips. 'We
believe that this is a blip and if it is not a blip we will assess our
commitment to bond markets.'
Analysts nevertheless lowered their forecasts for the full year, predicting
profits would fall by about a third from the Pounds 90.5m reported in
1993-94.
Of the Pounds 20m estimated drop in interim profits, Hambros attributed
about Pounds 10m to the bond business and a fall in net interest revenue.
Hambros had continued to lend to corporate clients, but margins had
narrowed.
Hambros said provisions were expected to rise by Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 7.5m,
against the trend for commercial banks.
Analysts questioned the bank's control of costs. Increased overheads because
of recruitment and investment in new business areas accounted for Pounds
2m-Pounds 3m of the expected profit fall.
Analysts had expected Hambro Countrywide, the estate agency 50 per cent
owned by Hambros, to boost results as the housing market recovered. But
Hambro Countrywide reported a deficit of Pounds 700,000 for the six months
to June against a profit of Pounds 13.3m in the first half of 1993.

FT  05 OCT 94 / US group may buy Ulster engineer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A big US company may be about to buy FG Wilson (Engineering), the
Larne-based company which is Europe's largest producer of diesel sets used
for generating electricity.
Privately-held Wilson, one of Northern Ireland's most successful engineering
companies, confirmed yesterday that its directors were in discussions with a
'major American corporation' which had approached it. Wilson would not name
the suitor and said talks were at a preliminary stage. It expected to make a
further statement by today.
Last night, there was strong speculation that Emerson Electric, the US
electrical and electronics product group, would launch a bid for Wilson. A
spokesman for Emerson said he had no information on any bid.
If Wilson is taken over, it would be the second purchase this week of an
independent UK producer of generating sets. Cummins Engine, the US diesel
engine group, is buying Sandwich, Kent-based Power Group International, best
known for its Petbow, Auto Diesel and Agreba brands.
A substantial investment in Wilson would be a major coup for a company
wishing to enter the fast-growing market for diesel generating sets. The
Larne company was founded in 1966, and has grown to achieve annual sales of
more than Pounds 160m and export markets in 120 countries.
It employs about 1,000 people, most of them at Larne. It recently moved into
an old GEC factory there, consolidating manufacturing which used to take
place at five separate facilities.
A link-up with a company such as Emerson, one of the best-known names in the
world electrical products industry, could give Wilson access to a wider
distribution network. Other names mentioned as possible bidders included
Caterpillar, the world's largest construction equipment company, which also
has a power generation business.
At Cummins, Mr James Henderson, president and chief executive, said PGI fit
'right into our product diversification strategy and our goal to achieve
profitable growth in global markets'. Terms were not disclosed, but Cummins
said PGI was profitable and had sales last year of Pounds 59m. It has plants
in the UK and Singapore producing generators ranging from 20KW to 3MW and
more than 400 employees.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Tiphook family trust sells shares worth Pounds 143,351
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculation over the financial health of Tiphook founder Robert Montague was
heightened yesterday, after his family trust sold 434,398 shares in the
recently-renamed Central Transport Rental Group, raising Pounds 143,351.
The shares were sold on Monday, the day on which the Royal Bank of Scotland
had planned to serve a bankruptcy petition on the CTRG chief executive.
It is understood that the petition will be served later this week, when Mr
Montague returns from the US. The Royal Bank is chasing up a Pounds 2.3m
loan, but Mr Montague has around Pounds 30m of personal debts.
Mr Montague stated at last months annual general meeting that he faced no
financial difficulties and the company spoke of an improving trading
performance, which makes the timing of the latest share sales somewhat
embarrassing.
A spokesman for CTRG said yesterday that the share sales were the decision
of the trustees, and that Mr Montague had no part in that decision.
The Spread Trustee Company sold another 410,000 shares last April, a month
after the company cemented the sale of its container leasing business. The
latest share sales were at 33p, against yesterday's middle closing price of
37p.
The shares were part of Mr Montague's 3.05m shareholding, which has lost 85
per cent of its value in the past year.
Mr Montague is understood to be in the US for talks with the lawyers
bringing a Dollars 700m class action against him and his company. The legal
action is on behalf of US investors who acquired several tranches of Tiphook
bonds shortly before a series of profit warnings sent the share price
sharply downwards.
The law suit claims that Mr Montague and his company 'embarked upon a high
profile, multi-media campaign to depict Tiphook, its business and its
prospects, in a materially false and misleading manner'.
CTRG is 'vigorously' defending the action. While it has made provisions for
the legal costs of its defence, it would not be in a position to survive any
substantial claim resulting from the case.

FT  05 OCT 94 / A choice between coffee and gold bullion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Securities firms are bearing the scars of the weakening bond and stock
markets - with the Goldman Sachs chairman retiring with 'tiredness' and SG
Warburg this week shocking the London stock market with a Monday morning
profits warning. But the investment banking community has come up with a
timely alternative: commodities.
Rising commodity prices erode manufacturers' profit margins and help
generate the inflation that eats away at the real returns on bonds. It does
not take a genius to work out that commodity prices are inversely correlated
to bond and stock returns, although backroom boffins are nevertheless on
hand to work out the precise coefficients.
The timing is favourable, but all the same it is a tricky task to promote
commodities as a respectable asset class that pension fund trustees would
want to talk about in polite company. Perhaps that is why firms such as
Goldman and JP Morgan are recommending only a cautious pension fund
weighting of 5 per cent or so in commodities, although the logic of the
optimisation calculations might suggest a considerably higher exposure.
JP Morgan is the newcomer here, having just launched its own commodities
index - the JPMCI - which is designed to act as a portfolio benchmark. It
therefore rivals the already established Goldman Sachs version - the GSCI -
which is the benchmark for the first index-tracking commodities fund,
currently being launched by Barclays de Zoete Wedd as an offshore closed-end
vehicle.
There is an attempt here to shift commodities investment away from the
traditional emphasis upon short-term price speculation and fit it within a
long-term investment framework. A total return concept has been developed in
which three kinds of return are generated.
The price return is derived from the familiar risky exposure to the
volatility of commodity values (moderated by diversification). The roll
return comes from holding long positions and repeatedly rolling them over.
Finally there is the collateral return, usually taken as the yield on an
investment in US Treasury bills (the BZW fund will hold alternative
short-term debt instruments to earn slightly more).
Commodity markets still have some way to go to achieve complete
respectability. Cowboys still abound in the shadowy world of speculative
offshore futures funds, where charges sometimes run to 2 per cent a month,
with a share of profits as well. Charges on the BZW fund, it should be said,
are 1.25 per cent a year.
The key feature here is benchmarking, which is familiar to institutional
investors and allows a comparison with the returns earned on other asset
classes. However, commodity indices remain a potentially dangerous area for
the unwary.
Whereas the Economist index has risen by more than 30 per cent this year,
and hit a high on September 20, the widely-followed Commodities Research
Bureau index is barely higher than on January 1, having peaked on June 17.
These are price returns only. The JPMCI shows a total return of 23.5 per
cent so far this year.
It all depends on what you put into your commodity basket and how you
construct the index. The CRB Index is equally weighted. The GSCI, however,
is designed on the basis of economic weightings according to the value of
world production - energy accounts for just over 50 per cent, 'soft'
agricultural commodities about 40 per cent, base metals 6 per cent and
precious metals only about 3 per cent.
As for the JPMCI, it is designed to have particularly high negative
correlations with bond and stock returns. It has a precious metals content
of 23 per cent and no 'softs'. So the JPMCI has ignored the coffee price
boom and the GSCI would scarcely register a bull market in gold.
As ever, therefore, exposure to commodities is something of a hot potato.
Undoubtedly there are speculative opportunities in commodities in the later
stages of a global economic upturn. The timing is right. But for long-term
investment institutions to get involved on a more permanent basis, they must
have a very powerful need to reduce the volatility of their returns.
And they will have to be careful about benchmarks: there is scarcely any
gold in Goldman.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Gotcha] Mirror Group lures MacKenzie to cable channel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Mirror Group nabbed Kelvin MacKenzie yesterday, hauling on board the
former Sun editor who revelled for years in being rude about his tabloid
competitor.
Mr MacKenzie, with only seven months' television experience under his belt
when he quit BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster, in August, is joining the
Mirror Group to head its budding television interests. They consist of a 20
per cent stake in Scottish Television and the promise to launch Live TV, a
new cable channel, next year.
The man famous for the 'Gotcha' headline on the sinking of the Belgrano
during the Falklands war will report to Mr David Montgomery, Mirror Group's
chief executive and a man over whom he has poured volumes of vitriol since
they parted company at The Sun 13 years ago.
The last time they worked in close proximity was at the Wapping headquarters
of Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International group, where they edited sister
newspapers.
Neither man was available for comment yesterday but they did contribute
consecutive quotes to a press release: 'Kelvin is a major force in the
British media and with his unique background and recent broadcasting
experience will add dynamic leadership to our now well-developed framework
for TV entry,' said Mr Montgomery. Mr MacKenzie, a man of famously pithy and
often unprintable epithets, said: 'This is a terrific challenge and I can't
wait to get on with it.'
But forget the tele-strategy and synergy. Did Kelvin fire David 13 years ago
at The Sun? Mr Sean Bellew, for the Mirror Group, said: 'David says that is
simply not true. He was offered the assistant editorship of The People, so
he left.'
So why is Mr MacKenzie joining the Mirror? 'Kelvin has told me there is only
one reason for life,' said Mr Roy Greenslade, former Sun assistant editor.
'Get Sam Chisholm.'
Mr MacKenzie blamed his departure from BSkyB on a personality clash with Mr
Chisholm, its chief executive. Mr MacKenzie was managing director and,
according to colleagues, thought he would head BSkyB when Mr Chisholm
assumed a broader role in Mr Murdoch's television empire.
Given a common enemy, Mr MacKenzie and Mr Montgomery might be able to work
together, a friend of both said yesterday. 'Kelvin does have a grudging
respect for what David's done at the Mirror,' he said.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Ford puts two UK plants on short-time working
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Workers at Ford's Halewood and Dagenham car plants are to go on short-time
for the rest of this month, taking a total of 8,000 Escorts and 2,000
Fiestas out of production.
Ford put most of the blame on a weaker than expected UK market. But its main
rivals said they had no plans to take similar action and dismissed
speculation that the move might indicate a faltering of the UK economic
recovery.
Ford is to review its decision towards the end of the month, when it is
expected to extend short-time working into November, and possibly to the end
of the year.
Retail motor trade leaders believe that Ford, UK market leader, has been
particularly hard hit by the industry's overoptimistic forecast of the
likely size of the annual August sales 'bulge'.
Most of the UK car trade had expected the August market to reach 500,000
units, a figure matching the record of 1989, but it reached only 452,000.
Motor traders claim that many of these 'sales' were pre-registered by
manufacturers or their dealers and, as a result, have yet to find final
buyers.
Mr Alan Pulham, head of the National Franchised Dealers' Association, said
last night that the miscalculation meant there were nearly 100,000 excess
new cars in the industry's supply pipeline.
The excess stocks would sharply increase competition in the final quarter of
the year. However, he described the excess as a 'blip we have to go through;
I don't think we have an underlying economic weakness'.
Ford's Halewood plant on Merseyside will bear the brunt of the cuts in
hours. Its 5,000 employees are to work for three days a week until the end
of the month, losing output of 800 cars each day. Although the Escort is the
UK's best-selling car, Halewood supplies the UK market solely. A small
proportion of its Escort van production is exported.
The Dagenham plant, which makes Fiesta cars and vans, will lose a total of
two days' production this month, amounting to a total of 2,000 cars and
vans. It has not been so badly hit because it exports about a third of its
output to continental Europe.
Vauxhall, second in the UK market, said yesterday it had no plans to cut
production. Peugeot Talbot is raising production at its Ryton plant near
Coventry.

FT  05 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Insider dealing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock exchange's proposals for limiting insider dealing have at least
one thing to be said for them. Companies will not be happy if trading in
their shares is suspended as a result of unusual price movements. But that
is partly the point of the proposals. Companies wanting to avoid an
embarrassing suspension would have every incentive to announce
price-sensitive information they feared might leak out. And the sooner such
information was published, the less opportunity insider dealers would have
to make a profit.

FT  05 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: News Corporation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
News Corporation's share price has dropped 6 per cent since it revealed a
plan at the weekend to issue preference shares with restricted voting
rights. Australian investors are worried that it could allow chairman Mr
Rupert Murdoch to splash out on acquisitions without seeing any diminution
of his family's 33 per cent voting strength. The scheme has echoes of last
year's super-voting shares proposal, which was abandoned after institutional
shareholders rallied behind the slogan of 'one share one vote'.
While some aspects of the original scheme were objectionable, there is
little wrong with the new plan. Nobody is forced to sell ordinary shares or
buy preference shares. If some investors are happy to be disenfranchised,
others should not cry foul. Rather, they should welcome the issue of
preference shares as a way of expanding the group without taking debt on to
its balance sheet - a course which nearly led to insolvency in 1990.
There is, of course, a risk that a tie-up with a telecoms group or some
other multimedia venture would prove unwise. But nobody should invest in
News Corp in the first place if they do not back Mr Murdoch's strategic
vision.

FT  05 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Hambros
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This has turned into a really bad week for merchant banks. The temptation
after Hambros' profits warning yesterday is to conclude that something is
wrong which no amount of strategic fine-tuning can rectify. Whereas Warburg
suffered as a result of its global aspirations which had led to an increased
emphasis on trading, Hambros is diversified with a range of niche activities
like estate agency and insurance loss-adjustment. Even in the bond, markets
its focus is on issues in high-yielding antipodean currencies: it declines
to take the big houses on in US dollar Eurobonds. Yet this spread of
business has not spared it from the ravages of the market.
For Hambros, this raises a specific worry about dividend cover, which now
starts to look rather thin. Two profit warnings in this sector in as many
days must focus minds elsewhere too. If the quality of earnings from
investment banking and the ratings attached to them are low, then it may
make less sense for banks like Barclays to focus on such activity as an
engine of growth. Institutions like Schroders may become more reluctant to
push further into distribution, unless they believe they can make a decent
return without relying on proprietary trading.

FT  05 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Ford
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
That Ford, the UK's largest car maker, has introduced short-time working for
October and probably for the rest of the year, should set alarm bells
ringing. The question is whether they are ringing for Ford, the UK
automotive industry, or the economy in general.
Ford's UK business is clearly in difficulties. The group's market share has
slipped from 30 per cent in the mid-1980s to just 22 per cent. But the
company's particular problems only partly explain yesterday's announcement.
It was also an admission that the UK automotive industry had been expanding
at an unsustainable rate. Car sales during the first seven months this year
rose an astonishing 14 per cent, far faster than the economy. In August, the
most important month of the UK automotive calender, sales growth slowed to
only 2.8 per cent, a deceleration likely to be confirmed by September's
figures tomorrow. If more discounts are needed to inject life into the
market, margins for manufacturers and suppliers will remain tight - hence
yesterday's fall in automotive component manufacturers' shares.
A deceleration in the UK automotive market is unwelcome when prospects for
the retail and housing sectors remain so uncertain. However, any slowdown
need not undermine the UK's economic recovery. Ford, with the lowest
proportion of overseas sales of any significant UK manufacturer, has been
unable to export itself out of trouble. Others should compensate by
increasing exports to rapidly recovering continental markets.

FT  05 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's wipes the slate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's judgment in favour of the Gooda Walker names represents an
overdue mucking out of a very dirty Lloyd's of London stable. There is
considerable uncertainty about the amount of money that Gooda Walker names
will eventually receive, but the ruling should pave the way for settlement
of at least some of the outstanding litigation against Lloyd's.
The eventual payout will be borne substantially by other Lloyd's names who
provided errors and omissions cover to those now found negligent. This does
not necessarily mean fresh calls on the Lloyd's market, as most of the
expected losses have already been provided for. The judgment will probably
accelerate the exodus of individual names from the market, but potential
corporate investors will recognise that the ruling relates to the past. The
new Lloyd's offers rather appealing prospects for those convinced that the
market has made a clean break with its recent history.
For the 1993 financial year, Lloyd's is expected to make a profit of Pounds
800m-Pounds 1bn. The worst underwriters at Lloyd's have been driven out.
Those that remain are highly selective in taking on new risks: the market's
capacity will only be about 75 per cent utilised this year. Lloyd's biggest
problem is that it must still set up reinsurance to cover pre-1986 risks,
primarily on US asbestos and pollution claims. Investors may be unwilling to
commit substantial new capital until the new arrangements are in place at
the end of next year.

FT  05 OCT 94 / EU to draw up plan for admitting six eastern members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union decided yesterday to draw up detailed measures to
integrate six east and central European countries into its single market, in
preparation for their full membership of the Union.
Foreign ministers of the 12 asked the European Commission to produce a white
paper listing the measures that Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic,
Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania need to adopt in order to prepare their
economies and legal frameworks for EU accession.
The strategy consciously replicates a 1985 white paper which led to the
creation of the single market, and is a demonstration of the EU's commitment
to enlargement to the east.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister of Germany, which is using its presidency
of the EU to advance the eastward expansion, welcomed the consensus, saying
the white paper 'must be the cornerstone of our strategy'.
The white paper strategy, which was agreed in advance by France and Germany,
meshes with the Commission's own approach. It is expected to be endorsed at
December's EU summit in Essen, while the measures themselves should be ready
by next June's summit under the French EU presidency.
Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, strongly denied that Paris was
lukewarm about further EU expansion soon after the enlargement scheduled to
take in Austria, Sweden, Norway and Finland in January.
'I have done everything I can to push enlargement forward,' he said, adding
that more overt enthusiasts were privately expressing misgivings.
Indeed, senior officials from the UK, a strong supporter of eastward
expansion, said there 'can be no firm timetable before 1996' setting entry
date targets. In 1996, the EU will review its constitutional arrangements
and how far to tighten Union links before further growth in membership which
could risk making it unwieldy.

As and when the British Post Office is privatised, will the red pillar box

corner furniture may go the way of telephone booths, which, following the
sale of British Telecom, metamorphosed from sturdy red edifices to
distinctly flimsier glass arrangements.
They should take heart, though, from Bill Cockburn, the Post Office's chief
executive, who claims there are no such terrible schemes afoot. To prove the
point, he keeps a model of the Victorian post box in his office - a
veritable beacon to his commitment to keep them red for e'er and a day.

Surprise, surprise. Next year's Derby - first run on the Epsom downs in 1780

money than it knows what to do with. Not surprisingly, Gerry Whent, chief
executive of Vodafone, and Sir Ernest Harrison, chairman, are keen on the

the launch of the Pounds 3.5m, three-year sponsorship package at the Savoy
yesterday Sir Ernest denied that the decision to back the Derby had
originated at the top, but had been taken by a company committee which had
recommended it to the board. It was unanimously approved. Of course.

If you come from the Rock of Gibraltar you learn how to take life's knocks.
Take Joe Bossano, chief minister of Gibraltar, who has been doing the rounds
 -or at least trying to - at the IMF/World Bank meetings in Madrid this
week.
Bossano, who is about as welcome to the Spanish government as a banderilla
is to a bull, hitched himself up at the last minute to the British
delegation. As a Crown colony, Gibraltar is one of the very few remaining
blobs of pink on the global map so he can't be refused. However, Her
Majesty's man in Madrid knows how to put people down and Bossano was not
invited to Monday night's bash in honour of Kenneth Clarke, Britain's
chancellor of the exchequer. Yesterday Spain's prime minister Felipe
Gonzalez snubbed Bossano again by refusing him an invite to the champagne
and tapas junket marking the formal opening.
Much more of this and Bossano will be declaring independence.

<TEXT>
Imagine what would happen if Michael Heseltine had been taken hostage by
angry French airport baggage handlers. It may be a far-fetched thought. But
why else did Britain's president of the board of trade apparently put
pressure on the Department of Transport to delay the announcement that it
was taking the European Commission to court over the extravagant subsidies
for Air France? It went out only after he had caught his plane back to
London.
Heseltine, on a trip to promote Anglo-French industrial collaboration, was
in no mood to take any chances. Even at dinner on Monday night when one of
the guests, a former Air France board member, discussed Air France
subsidies, Hezza made a point of saying he had never brought up the subject.
Chicken.

Ah, the tricky business of coming up with a Euro-name that doesn't offend
somebody, somewhere.
Ferdinand Piech, chief executive of Volkswagen, proudly presented at the
Paris Motor Show yesterday the group's new multi-purpose vehicle, designed
to do battle with Renault's highly-successful Espace, among others. And in
Europe it will be called Sharan.
Sharan? That might be dandy in Germany, Italy or France, but in the UK it
sounds mighty similar to Sharon, a girl's name with decidedly down-market
overtones.
Understandably, Richard Ide, managing director of VW's UK
importer/distributor, is less than thrilled. He says no decision has yet
been made on a UK name.
Could always try Wayne; or perhaps Cynthia? Gary has a nice ring to it.
Maybe Ermintrude? Then again, what about. . .

FT  05 OCT 94 / United in wishful thinking: The Northern Irish seem fairly
optimistic - but disappointments may lie ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As you leave the Bogside (or 'Free Derry') and drive towards the centre of
the city, which road signs elsewhere in Northern Ireland still call
Londonderry, a striking mural confronts you. It shows a back view of British
soldiers walking into the distance, past a signpost clearly marked 'London'.
Seventy odd miles away is another mural, painted on the side of a house
facing into the Shankill Road, a long finger of militant Protestantism
thrust defiantly into Catholic west Belfast. It is literary rather than
pictorial: '1969 IRA ran away. 1994 IRA surrendered.'
So both sides have won. Or think they have. Or want you to think they have.
Or are trying to convince themselves that they have. Or perhaps a mixture of
all of the above. If there is one common feature which just now seems to
unite almost all factions in both parts of Ireland, it is wishful thinking.
Almost but not quite all factions - at least not if Dr Conor Cruise O'Brien,
the former UN envoy and Irish cabinet minister, can be considered a faction.
He greeted the IRA ceasefire on August 31 with a series of dire predictions
in British newspapers, culminating in a chronology of disasters that
included half a million refugees and 10,000 fatal casualties in a civil war
ending 'in stalemate with a smaller but entirely Protestant Northern
Ireland'; a military coup in Dublin; and explosions in several British
cities - all by the end of 1995.
I could not find anyone in Belfast or Dublin last week who would admit to
believing in the whole of this scenario, but several people asked me what I
thought of it, as though anxious to be reassured. In my turn I asked Mr John
Bruton, leader of the main opposition party in Dublin, Fine Gael, what he
thought. The nightmare was possible, he replied; but 'on average you don't
have a nightmare every night. The likelihood is that it won't occur. The
role of people like Dr Conor Cruise O'Brien is to prove themselves wrong by
warning in time of the danger.'
Many of the Northern Irish Protestants I met admitted to being more
optimistic now than when the ceasefire was announced. The suspicion of a
secret deal between the IRA and the British government has largely faded.
Indeed, many express a degree of confidence in the British prime minister
seldom heard on the mainland. His pledge of a referendum on any new
arrangement for Northern Ireland is welcomed by unionists and generally
believed. Even his rough treatment of the Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of
the Democratic Unionist party, seems to have paid off: several Protestants
expressed embarrassment about Mr Paisley's behaviour, while the only person
who criticised Mr John Major's reaction was a southern Irish diplomat.
There could, however, be a psychological explanation for this unexpected
surge of unionist confidence in the British government. As Professor Paul
Bew, a political scientist at Queen's University, pointed out: 'It's very
uncomfortable for unionists to believe in a sell-out, because if you really
did believe that you'd have to prepare for a very unpleasant conflict.'
The fact is that IRA violence against British and Protestant targets has
completely ceased since August 31, and that that is a great relief to the
people. Mentally they remain on their guard, but emotionally they cannot
help relaxing a bit. Obviously it is nicer to think this relaxation has a
good chance of becoming permanent than to prepare for a reversion to
violence and insecurity in weeks or months.
The only thing unionists have ever had to hope for, all through the long
years of violence, is that one day the IRA would realise the futility of the
'armed struggle'. Once they begin to think that that day might have arrived,
the attraction of the thought becomes irresistible.
But of course the thought has to be rationalised. Evidence of some sort has
to be found. It is found, paradoxically, in the very success and publicity
which the IRA's switch to a 'peace strategy' has enjoyed. Particularly for
the Sinn Fein leaders, this conversion is seen as having produced such
dividends in the shape of applause and respectability on both sides of the
Atlantic that it seems hardly conceivable they would sacrifice it all by
switching back to violence.
I found many people disposed to take Mr Gerry Adams's statement to the
Boston Herald last week at face value, when he said no one could guarantee
'two or three years up the road that if the causes of conflict aren't
resolved another IRA leadership won't come along'. In other words, people
accept that Mr Adams and his colleague, Mr Martin McGuinness, are now
personally identified with the new strategy to the point where, for them at
least, there is no going back.
It was to see Mr McGuinness that I went to 'Free Derry'. Needless to say, he
does not think the IRA has surrendered. Republicans, he said, were now
'totally and absolutely committed to the peace process', but their decision,
which had 'totally transformed the situation on this island', was 'taken
from a position of considerable strength'.
Was there a danger that the 'peace process' could fail, I asked. Yes, he
said. 'In Ireland there is danger all the time. But I am not in any way at
all looking at this from a pessimistic point of view. We have a very real
opportunity to resolve this conflict.'
Permanent? 'Nothing in life is permanent,' said Mr McGuinness. It was all up
to the British government. 'Since August 31 they have removed the
broadcasting ban and reopened a handful of cross-border roads, while keeping
the vast majority closed. Most people regard that as a measly response.
There is a very real danger of the momentum being lost.'
I asked what kind of solution to the conflict he envisaged. 'No party will
go on record on its bottom line before a negotiation,' he replied. 'Of
course our preferred solution is a unitary state, a united Ireland. Other
parties to the negotiations will have a different view. But the key thing is
acceptance by the British government that at some time in the future Britain
will end its jurisdiction, even if that is some way down the road. When the
British government accepts that inevitability, it will be a matter for all
the Irish parties to work out the structures.'
Slightly twisting the words of the Downing Street Declaration, Mr McGuinness
claimed that document already contained 'a clear acceptance by the British
government that the solution has to be an island-of-Ireland solution'.
Britain, he said, had undertaken to 'facilitate' such a solution, but the
onus was on it to go one step further and 'persuade' the unionists. 'Once
the unionists accept that the British government is involved in a process of
disengagement, it becomes a matter for the people of Ireland.
Psychologically, once the British government makes it clear to the
unionists, you're talking about a very fertile field.'
The 'worst scenario', he conceded, 'would be that elements of unionism would
try to rebel. In that case the British government should have the will to
confront people who disrupt the process.' He brushed aside my suggestion
that, having once agreed to withdraw, Britain would be more likely to get on
and do so, leaving the Irish of all persuasions to fight it out.
When I said that in the same declaration, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish
prime minister, had agreed to give the majority in Northern Ireland the
final say on sovereignty, Mr McGuinness replied: 'We would totally disagree
with that.' Why, he asked, should 900,000 unionists have the right to
overrule 600,000 nationalists in Northern Ireland, when 'on the island there
are 3 1/2 m other people with a keen interest', not to mention 'many
millions' in Britain itself who, he claimed, 'believe the British government
should disengage'. 'It's not fair,' he concluded, 'to give the destiny of
Ireland solely over to those 900,000 people, as opposed to the feelings and
wishes of all the others.'
Nor would he accept that in a united Ireland the northern Protestants would
form a minority at least as disgruntled as the northern Catholics now are in
the UK. 'Nothing could be further from the truth. Many political parties in
the 26 counties (ie the south) are not too far distant from them: the
Progressive Democrats, Fine Gael, the Democratic left.' Together with these
allies, he suggested, the unionists might well form a government 'in a
totally new Ireland'. He did not seem to realise that, if some unionists do
regard the southern parties he named as allies, it is because those parties
accept, more clearly and less equivocally than the Irish government, that
Northern Irish Protestants have a distinct culture and history, and have the
right to remain in the UK.
But what, I asked, if Britain and the unionists are not so obliging? How
long would the IRA tolerate a deadlock? 'I can't speak for them,' said Mr
McGuinness coyly. 'But Sinn Fein is committed to the peace process. We shall
be very disappointed if the British government doesn't speak with Sinn Fein
very soon. The talks need to begin now.'
On its side, the government's position is that 'exploratory' talks will be
held within three months, after it has sufficient indications that the IRA
intends the ceasefire to be permanent, and there has been 'a period of
verification'. My impression is that the period of verification has already
begun, and that the government is waiting less for a specific form of words
from the IRA than for a feeling that unionist opinion is ready.
Britain is certainly bothered, as is Mr Bruton in Dublin, by the fact that
the IRA does not regard the 'cessation of violence' as affecting the methods
it uses to enforce order within its own constituency. The only change is
that the presumed delinquents' legs and arms are now broken with iron bars
instead of their knee caps being shattered by a gunshot.
These 'punishment beatings' are apparently popular in areas where the Royal
Ulster Constabulary makes few attempts to deal with common law crime. But,
as Mr Bruton said, 'an organisation that has to maintain that sort of
intimidation in its own area cannot be said to be fully committed to
democratic politics'. He professed to hope that his own government 'will put
sufficient pressure on Sinn Fein to remedy those situations' - which sounds
like more wishful thinking.
Another area of uncertainty is the future of loyalist violence. Everyone
tells you, including their quasi-official spokesman, Mr David Ervine, that
the loyalists are 'close' to deciding on a ceasefire. But Mr Ervine added
that they were held back by a 'lingering fear' that the Framework Document
for new inter-party talks, on which London and Dublin are working, would
contain 'something fearful for unionists' - meaning something that opens the
way to Northern Ireland's detachment from the UK and its creeping annexation
by Dublin.
Mainstream unionists seem more confident that this will not be the case,
pointing to the delay in producing the document (now expected in November)
as evidence that London is resisting pressure from Dublin. The one thing
that is certain is that no one in Northern Ireland will welcome the
Framework Document when (or if) it does appear. It is bound to attract
unionist suspicion, while falling short of even moderate nationalist hopes,
let alone those expressed by Mr McGuinness. Moreover, as a spokesman for Mr
John Hume's nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party candidly said,
'anybody welcoming it would be mad', since they would thereby give the other
side a reason to reject it.
Such is the nature of Northern Irish politics, which the non-violent parties
and the British well understand. But the IRA and the loyalist paramilitaries
have their own way of registering disappointment when something falls short
of their expectations. The Framework Document will surely disappoint one of
them, and probably both. At that point, some of Dr Conor Cruise O'Brien's
nightmares may start coming true.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Insider dealing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Well-meaning but unworkable. That is likely to be the verdict on yesterday's
consultation document from the London Stock Exchange on tackling insider
dealing. The proposals could also prove more damaging to markets than the
report appears to acknowledge.
The exchange's aim is to protect investors from the effects of trading based
on unpublished price-sensitive information. Its main suggestion is that it
will intervene whenever a share price breaches certain pre-set criteria
based on volatility. While investigating whether the jump derives from a
leak of price-sensitive corporate information, it may issue an 'alert' to
the market, warning that the share is under investigation. Alternatively, it
could declare trading 'indicative', removing marketmakers' obligation to
quote firm prices and sizes at which they will deal. Or it could temporarily
halt trading in a share, possibly leading to suspension of the listing.
The proposals arise from the exchange's acute and understandable frustration
at the low level of prosecutions and convictions of insider dealers. They
have also been prompted by improvements to its electronic surveillance of
trading, which allow it more easily to monitor price jumps and discern
traders' identities.
But the shortcomings of the proposals are legion. For a start, they are
unlikely to pick up more cases of insider dealing, many of which do not
cause the share price to move. Instead, they will 'catch' a much larger
group of trades - those which are motivated simply by unsubstantiated
rumours. In doing so, the exchange is attempting to protect 'outside'
investors from the speculation of market professionals, even where those
professionals are not strictly insiders. But information and rumour will
never be distributed evenly across a market. Given the frequency of such
speculative trades, the exchange is setting the scene for a farce in which
it may find itself playing a prominent part.
The measures are also potentially damaging to the markets. The exchange will
itself be inserting price-sensitive information into the market, namely,
that a stock is under investigation. Moreover, it sacrifices too lightly the
principle that trading should be interrupted only in extreme circumstances,
a principle which does much to protect investors.
For all the good intentions of yesterday's paper, the better way to protect
the market is to convince traders and investors that insider dealing will be
detected and punished. That may depend on improving the rate of successful
prosecutions. Ministers and financial regulators should consider whether the
burden of proof required in criminal prosecution is too high, and whether
insider dealing should also be made a civil offence, as it is in the US.
That question deserves serious evaluation. The best weapon against insider
dealing is the carefully targeted pursuit of suspicious trades.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Cardoso's prize
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The first-round victory of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso in Brazil's
presidential elections - assuming the official count confirms exit poll
results - presents Latin America's largest economy with its best chance in
years to move on to a path of sustainable non-inflationary growth.
This is good news not only for Brazilians, but for the rest of South
America. The country has in the past five years become an open economy, and
a growing Brazil could drive the growth of the whole region.
Mr Cardoso, as finance minister, was the architect of the plan which has
brought down Brazil's inflation from 50 per cent a month to below 2 per
cent. He now has a chance to complete the job.
He has been right to emphasise the end of inflation as a policy priority.
Inflation has widened already extreme disparities between rich and poor,
corroded the country's social and moral fabric, and grossly distorted the
economy toward non-productive activities. Defeating inflation is an
essential objective that will allow him to concentrate on alleviating
Brazil's social miseries.
A first-round victory will be helpful. It gives him a stronger mandate,
strengthening his hand in the inevitable future battles with Congress,
public servants and others who will resist reform.
It avoids a further six weeks of campaigning. This should allow him to
advance planning on economic strategy, ready for when he takes over on
January 1. It will also permit him to spend more time building a political
coalition.
This is necessary because much essential legislation will require a
two-thirds Congressional majority to change Brazil's leviathan 1988
constitution. There will be difficulties. There is no guarantee that Mr
Cardoso's pre-electoral pact will survive and there is no reason to expect
that Brazil's new legislators will display any more foresight than their
myopic predecessors.
Mr Cardoso will be assailed from many quarters. Public and private sector
pay claims, pressure from industry for a competitive exchange rate and an
inflation-hooked financial system in which some banks are perilously weak
could all combine to shake his anti-inflation plan.
Yet his economic priorities are clear. The government budget will be about
balanced this year, but is still unstable. The conditions for long-term
budgetary stability will require constitutional changes to ensure
fundamental fiscal and social security reform. Measures are needed, too, to
end state-sanctioned monopolies, to accelerate privatisation, to enhance the
competitiveness of the economy and to reform the financial system - and to
make the central bank independent.
Brazil has a long way yet to go, but the prize is great: a country focusing
on its social problems and taking its rightful place as one of the world's
10 largest economies as the economic leader of South America.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Out with the old
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Like any new, young, energetic manager brought in to rescue a failed
enterprise, Mr Tony Blair has begun his leadership of the Labour party by
seeking a fresh statement of mission. It is clearly his intention to follow
that with a thorough modernisation of every aspect of Labour's work.
He is to be congratulated. Voters will not believe that the party is
absolutely purged of its former Marxist leanings while its statement of
objectives contains Clause IV, which calls for wholesale nationalisation.
Labour, Mr Blair told the conference in his first speech to it as leader
yesterday, 'requires a modern constitution that says what we are in terms
the public cannot misunderstand and the Tories cannot misrepresent'.
It was an historic moment. In 1959 Hugh Gaitskell tried to have the clause
removed, but he was thwarted by the left. He died a frustrated man. His
successors, from the then Mr Harold Wilson to the late Mr John Smith, have
all avoided the reopening of the Clause IV debate, arguing that the revision
of an antiquated few lines in an old document was not worth the danger of
splitting the party.
Mr Blair has clearly decided that the balance of advantage lies the other
way. He is right. The direction in which he seeks to lead the people's party
is away from state socialism, trade union dominance, high taxation, carefree
expenditure, acquiescence in inflation, class warfare and some of the
expensive but anachronistic traditions of the 50-year-old welfare state.
It is towards becoming the party that tackles crime, supports the family,
restores civic society, reconstructs the constitution and pursues social and
economic objectives that are little different from those of one-nation
Tories.
In the 76 days since he became leader, Mr Blair has done much to reposition
his party. His carefully judged speech yesterday took the project further
forward in leaps and bounds. He spoke not to 'comrades' but to 'friends' and
'colleagues'. He answered calls for the repeal of 1980s trade union
legislation with a simple No, and set realistic limits to the expectations
of the unemployed and the low paid. He insisted, above all, that the party
be truthful with itself.
That established, he sought to sell Labour as the party of all voters who
reject the Conservatives. He did not mention the Liberal Democrats; his
strategies could easily steal many of their supporters for Labour. Mr Blair,
with his over-arching theme of the individual and the community as mutually
supportive ('social-ism'), has laid down principles which many voters may
find attractive.
Much work is still needed in coming months to turn those principles into
practical policies, or even a detailed electoral strategy. There are also
plenty of pitfalls ahead - from the precise level at which Labour sets its
proposed minimum wage, to the inevitable arguments about tax. But in setting
out a broad framework within which the process of change must continue, Mr
Blair has made an impressive start.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Agenda for trade: Renato Ruggiero, would-be head of the WTO,
on its tasks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RENATO RUGGIERO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'If goods cannot cross borders, soldiers will.' This familiar thought
vividly depicts the strong influence that trade exercises on politics.
Protectionism is a road that leads to economic nationalism and, as history
proves, economic nationalism can easily transform itself into political
nationalism.
That is why the establishment, on January 1 1995, of the third Bretton Woods
Institution, the World Trade Organisation, will be an outstanding
achievement, not only for the world economy but for stability. Every
possible effort has to be made to achieve this target date. The urgency of
completing the ratification of the Uruguay Round is of paramount importance.
The top priority for the new institution is clear. The World Trade
Organisation has to be the rampart for the defence and expansion of free
trade in a system of clear rules. At the same time, the WTO should become
the guarantor of an efficient and credible multilateral trading system in a
new era of global co-operation.
But to declare the vital importance of free trade will not be sufficient.
The new institution should develop a special taskforce with the aim of
showing governments and public opinion what is at stake when making choices
between free trade and protectionism. The globalisation of the economy and
growing interdependence of national economies will increase the importance
of the way each government handles its economic affairs.
In fact we face an unprecedented prospect of economic growth. Between 2bn
and 3bn people in Asia, Latin America and the former communist countries are
entering the market economy. As both consumers and producers, they could be
seen by their trading partners as an opportunity or as a challenge. The
World Trade Organisation has to convince people and nations that only free
trade represents the right answer to this new opportunity for growth.
One of the greatest successes of the Uruguay Round has been the active
participation in the negotiations, for the first time, of a very large
number of developing countries. Their behaviour has shown that they want to
act as full partners in the multilateral trading system and that they are
ready to participate in the liberalisation process by opening their markets.
The WTO will be responsible for safeguarding their legitimate expectations
that their efforts will be duly matched by access to the markets of
developed countries.
We have to take into account the fact that the international trading system
is no longer in the hands of a small group of big players. The success of
the new institution will depend heavily on its ability to represent the
interests of all groups, including the least developed countries.
At the same time it is clear that, while free trade is the engine of growth,
it cannot solve all the world's economic problems. That is why the new task
of co-ordinating the work of the WTO with the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank will be so important.
The Uruguay Round has successfully established a unified and strong system
for the settlement of disputes. It is important that the new procedure
should be rapidly implemented as a response to the requirements of the
trading system.
The efficient functioning of the new dispute settlement procedure will be a
central feature of the system. If it does not function efficiently, the
rules of international trade will not be safe from attack.
This requirement gains importance from the end of the cold war. Now that
political considerations no longer have to be subordinated to security,
there is a risk that trade conflicts will blow up out of all proportion.
Last but not least, there is the growing importance of regional economic
groupings such as the North American Free Trade Area and the European Union.
This trend has produced remarkable successes in the process of liberalising
trade around the world.
In a global economy, these regional groupings facilitate the task of trade
negotiations by decreasing in certain cases the number of players needing to
be involved. They also encourage compromise between member governments.
Regional groupings are losing some of their importance from the point of
view of trade preference, with tariff levels on the industrial products of
the industrialised countries at only around 4 per cent. But the increasing
role of regional groupings as negotiating partners makes it easier for them
to defend the trade interests of members. They may also seek to impose their
own rules in international negotiations.
Without an efficient and credible multilateral system, therefore, there is a
risk that regionalism will bring the world economy back to bilateralism. The
danger is no less important than the risks of a new protectionism.
The new institution will face a formidable agenda. First, the implementation
of all the agreements reached in the Uruguay Round. At the same time the
unfinished business - which could not be settled in the final stage of the
Uruguay Round negotiations - has to be concluded. Liberalisation of
financial services, shipping services and telecommunications are on the
list.
The establishment of an environment committee with a clear mandate should
pave the way for a solution to the difficult question of how to reconcile
environmental objectives with Gatt rules. The relationship between
competition policy and trade, and the treatment of investment are to be high
priorities. Some governments have also raised aspects of the very complex
problem of labour standards.
Yet what is at stake now is the capacity of the world community to engage
itself in increasing the standards of living of all mankind. This long-term
effort will require more trade, more free trade and an efficient
multilateral system.
The author has served as Italy's ambassador to the EC and secretary general
at the foreign ministry. As trade minister between 1987 and 1991, he
implemented the programme for liberalising Italian foreign trade and capital
movements.

FT  05 OCT 94 / A shock to the system: The policy implications of plague in
India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The panic that has gripped India since the outbreak of plague in the city of
Surat less than two weeks ago has had at least one salutary effect. The
country's elite has been forced to consider the shocking physical conditions
in which most of their countrymen live.
Although only 50 people have so far died from the disease, a tiny number in
a population of 900m, plague has shaken the complacency of middle-class
Indians. In India, as in other countries, plague has spread fear because of
its frightening history, its mysteriousness, and the speed with which it
strikes.
With the disease claiming new victims every day, the outbreak has prompted a
political debate about India's public health and economic and social
development.
Indian newspaper commentators have attacked the government of Mr P V
Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, saying the free-market economic reforms
pursued for the past three years are not enough to bring genuine prosperity
to the great mass of Indians.
As the Times of India, the premier English-language daily newspaper, said in
an editorial: 'Unless India strengthens its social foundations . . . it can
hardly hope to build a globalised industrial economy.'
India prides itself on the advances in the health of its population over the
past 40 years. Since independence in 1947, average life expectancy has
almost doubled from 32 years to 60 years. The infant mortality rate has
fallen from 165 per thousand births in 1960 to 79. Smallpox has been
eradicated and leprosy brought under control.
But despite these achievements, India has fallen behind many other
developing countries. According to the United Nations Development
Programme's annual report, India ranks 134th among 173 countries in the
average citizen's overall quality of life, including health and education
standards as well as per capita income. Since India is placed 114th by
income per head, the country's education and healthcare are failing to match
its economic perform-ance.
India spends just over 3 per cent of its national income on health, about
the same as other poor countries monitored by the UNDP. But expenditure has
stagnated in recent years, because of a squeeze on public spending which
started in the mid-1980s and became more severe after Mr Narasimha Rao
started his reforms in 1991.
According to the World Bank, the proportion of gross domestic product spent
by India's states on social services, including health and education, has
fallen from 5.3 per cent in 1990-91 to 4.8 per cent in the year to March
1994. Professor D Banerji of the centre of social health and community
medicine at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi says: 'In the past few
years we have compromised our health services.'
The impact on public health of the modest priority given to health spending
is compounded by the way funds are used. India has 146 medical colleges,
which offer some of the best quality training in the developing world. The
medical establishment prides itself on producing doctors who carry out
world-class research and perform advanced neurosurgery and heart
transplants.
But too little attention is paid to providing basic services for the poor,
such as affordable clinics. Private health clinics have mushroomed in the
past decade, even in slums. They often offer poor quality health services,
with some doctors accused of working in league with local pharmacists to
foist the maximum amount of tablets on ignorant patients.
And, as the plague outbreak in Surat has shown, private clinics cannot
replace public services in an emergency. Private doctors and nurses were
among the first of the 300,000 people who fled the city.
Better medical services are not the only requirement, however. India's poor
need good water supplies, drains and sewers. The country has spent heavily
on some of these basic amenities since independence, bringing safe water to
75 per cent of the population. However, other services have been neglected,
notably the provision of toilets. Only 13 per cent of Indians have
lavatories; the rest use public conveniences or squat in the open air.
The impact of this is bad enough in the villages; it is much worse in the
sprawling, fast-growing cities. An estimated 20 per cent of urban Indians
have no properly built home and sleep in the streets or in huts made of mud,
wood, rubbish and plastic sheets.
Although many have lived in the same homes for years, they usually have no
legal right of occupation and the municipal authorities cannot provide
services. As Mr K K Dutta, director of the government's National Institute
of Communicable Diseases, says: 'How can you plan for these unauthorised
settlements?'
Even in middle-class districts, the drains and sewers are often blocked and
the rubbish is collected infrequently. The municipal authorities have
limited powers to fulfil their responsibilities to provide these services -
especially to raise taxes to pay for them.
Until the plague erupted, Indians mostly thought nothing of a pile of
stinking refuse rotting in the street. 'We lack civic sense,' is a common
complaint of middle-class Indians. What has been missing, however, is an
understanding of the dangers of living surrounded by so much filth.
The plague has forced people to confront these facts. Already there are
improvements: the streets of Delhi and Bombay have never been as clean as
they are today. But sustaining this requires investment in municipal
services and in public health education.
It will be difficult for the government or municipalities to find the money
needed to improve services. But India cannot afford to neglect social
services - poorly housed, badly fed, illiterate workers cannot participate
fully in a fast-moving modern economy.
While India has succeeded in the past three years in curbing the overall
amount of public spending, it has done little to direct it into the areas of
greatest need. State administrations spend 41 per cent of their revenues on
interest payments, wages and other administrative costs, up from 31 per cent
in the 1980s. That leaves 59 per cent for development spending such as
building schools, sewers and hospitals.
As part of his economic reform plan, Mr Narasimha Rao has considered
full-scale privatisation to raise funds for clearing debt, early retirement
to cut public sector staff levels and improvements in tax collection. With
the exception of the latter, there has been little progress. Perhaps the
plague will galvanise the authorities into action.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Identify pensions payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R V SIMONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Observer's comments ('Director's tonic', September 28) about the size
of payments to Glaxo's directors miss one important point. At least the
total burden on Glaxo's present and future income is quantified. The
contribution to Sir Paul Girolami's pension schemes is stated to have been
Pounds 696,000.
Contrast this with the typical company report. There it will be stated that
the company's pension contributions for directors is whatever the average
contribution rate is across the company multiplied by the directors'
salaries. In Sir Paul's case, this would presumably be less than Pounds
200,000. The difference is between earmarking specific funds to pay for an
individual's pension and assuming that it can be paid out of a general pot.
The burden is the same; the accounting treatment is different.
Perhaps it is time that company reports were obliged to show by how much the
actuarial value of directors' pension benefits had increased from one year
to the next. And in the event of insolvency of a pension scheme, to relate
benefits directly to contributions actually made. That could do wonders to
ensure schemes' solvency.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Management is election issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBIN W T BUCHANAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Fifteen years ago the Tories were emerging from an irrelevant,
backward-facing approach to the modern world, Labour was in thrall to the
loony left and the Liberals were in cloud cuckoo land. The political parties
offered three different strategies, all fundamentally wrong.
Today all three parties have roughly the same strategy, yet the columnists
debate policy differences as fiercely as ever.
Surely now the three parties have agreed on strategy, we should be
concentrating on the effective management of policy implementation.
Unfortunately, this is a skill unknown to most politicians and ignored by
most commentators.
As independent observers of, and advisers to, top management of leading UK
businesses, we worry most if two ingredients are missing - first, powerful
strategies and, second, the drive to implement them successfully. In public
life we are now lacking the second.
If the policies of any of the three main political parties were implemented
effectively the country would, in the main, be much better off. I seriously
doubt that will happen. Apathy, passive resistance, politicking, pessimism,
creaking institutional structures and lack of skills will conspire to
frustrate them all. A serious dose of change management is required, but do
any of the politicians have the skills? Let the next election be fought on
management not manifestos.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Decision needed on companies agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL WHITWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Department of Trade and Industry announced in July 1992 that there
was to be a full review of Companies House which could lead to full or
partial privatisation of the Cardiff-based registry. The review commenced in
earnest in October 1992 when consultants were appointed to examine its
operation and role. Since then, the DTI has considered various
recommendations, decided against full privatisation and now, two years on,
awaits further recommendation from the consultants on the appropriateness of
contracting out most of the work of Companies House ('Companies House plans
attacked', October 4). It is to the credit of the management and staff of
the agency that they have continued to maintain an admirable quality of
service throughout an unreasonably long period of uncertainty.
I have been among the critics of some of the activities of Companies House
following its creation as one of the 'Next Steps' agencies in 1988, but none
of my criticisms has related to the quality of service, which has improved
beyond reasonable expectations over the past six years. The companies
registry is now viewed quite rightly as among the most efficient in the
world today and is the envy of many jurisdictions.
It has to be questioned whether contracting out most of the work of
Companies House will lead to further improvements in efficiency or better
value for money. The management and staff of the agency have a wealth of
experience and the ability continuously to improve the service they provide
to the business community, both in ensuring company law compliance and
distributing publicly available information.
The annual report and accounts of Companies House, which won the Price
Waterhouse award for the best agency report, highlights what has been
achieved and gives a clear impression of the high quality of this
organisation.
I do hope the period of uncertainty ends soon and the DTI makes a decision
based on what is best for users of Companies House. My own view is fairly
clear.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Protection measures would damage
former socialist countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr DEAN SPINANGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Judy Dempsey nicely raises the issue of trade barriers against imports
from former socialist countries ('European neighbours fall out over garden
gnomes', September 26). However, Germany's steadfast EU border defence
against unlawful intrusions by Polish garden gnomes will be dwarfed by
protection measures which EU Mediterranean countries are trying to have
enacted against clothing imports from Poland and other former socialist
countries (FSCs).
The measures would be embodied in the pending revision of an EU regulation,
which permits EU fabrics to be sewn into clothing outside the EU (so-called
'offshore' processing) and then be re-imported under lower tariff rates.
In its most restricted version, the revision would cause a virtual drying-up
of such clothing imports from European FSCs. And since mainly German
companies have tapped this offshore potential (almost 70 per cent of the EU
total in 1992), and these countries accounted for almost 20 per cent
(roughly Dollars 4bn) of Germany's total clothing imports in 1993, German
consumers will be the first, but not the only ones, to be mangled.
But why should Italy be behind such restrictions or even feel that the
Germans are using their Council of Ministers presidency to attempt with
Teutonic finesse to destroy the foundation of the 'alta moda' industry? Is
it because Germany has successfully gone 'offshore' in the FSCs to produce
high-quality, fashionable clothing, with which they could outperform Italy
in leading EU and other export markets?
If this were the case, why should Italy then want to limit its own access to
an obviously advantageous option, from which the Italian textile industry
and the (still) highly competitive Italian textile machine industry would
also definitely profit?
The fact that answers are not forthcoming, that the other industries have
not protested and that consumers (not just in Germany) have remained silent,
is simply due to the veil of secrecy with which the EU shrouds such
decisions. Is Brussels listening to just a few, and giving little thought to
what happens in the struggling FSCs it pretends to help?

FT  05 OCT 94 / Arts: Cash in on misfortune, American style - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You need not spend long in an American hotel room, wearily zapping the
control button of the television, to discover that, despite a score of
channels, there are basically only two programmes on offer.
Both pander to the American love of hunting. One involves hapless victims -
abandoned women, impotent men, beaten children - who are publicly confronted
with their presumed predators while a bossy woman presenter, cheered on by
the audience, tries to extract blood. The other shows a professional
man-hunt: a mobile police team travels the freeways, preferably in
California, with a TV crew in the back of the car, primed to record crime on
the hoof.
Now we can receive a cathartic boost from the misfortunes of others without
the hassle of travel. On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, Vanessa, presented
by Vanessa Feltz, combines chutzpah and chest in prodigious quantities,
confronts sad cases and gets them to tell all, while on Monday The Nick had
cameras dogging the footsteps of the Leeds constabulary.
Unfortunately, British reticence and sense of fair play make Vanessa a pale
charade of the American template. There, a typical programme would include a
woman who has exploded into a 20-stone monolith surrendering to the urges of
the braying crowd and publicly casting off the quivering husband by her
side, who reacted to her weight gain by playing around. 'I'm beautiful; I'm
beautiful' she yells through her tears, while he wonders what has hit him.
In contrast, Vanessa is fudge. In her first show the curiosities for public
humiliation were a couple of virgins. The species has apparently disappeared
from our shores, so examples were flown in from the US. During the show more
virgins stood up to be counted, reducing night club owner Peter
Stringfellow, who is not a virgin, to stunned silence. Just to sort out
who's who, Stringfellow had his own caption: 'Peter can't remember how many
women he's bedded'.
With the audience contributing platitudes, and Vanessa the cosy folk wisdom
of her Jewish grandmother, the programme is totally dependent on the
eccentricity of the participants for its beef. Vanessa struck gold with
Sarah-Jane, a 37 year old virgin who has a doctor's certificate to prove it.
Sarah-Jane also likes to flounce around in sexy undies, which confused the
audience.
Programmes like Vanessa only offer a little afternoon escapism (it is
appropriately sponsored by Death by Chocolate) when they could be bringing
light to relevant issues and or help to a TV audience which is likely to be
in need. In most of the world virginity before marriage is accepted: a
debate on why it arouses such outrage in the west would be worthwhile.
At least Vanessa is lively, and decorative, thanks to a make-up policy which
ensures that everyone on screen comes up looking like roses (in the US the
audience doubles as a lynch mob), and loosely democratic. It is a step on
from the traditional chat show featuring oleaginous hosts and stars wanting
a plug which is fast becoming a moribund art form.
The BBC's attempt to resuscitate it late Saturday with Danny Baker, a
Vanessa lookalike, only succeeds in digging its grave deeper. Baker's Jack
the Lad personality is a fine background diversion on early morning radio,
but finds itself cruelly stretched around midnight. You need more than manic
laughter and obsequious guying to make entertainment out of interviews with
Malcolm McClaren and Timothy Spall. McClaren's prepared anecdotes meandered
into silence while Spall, with attractive subversion, said he was bored with
switching on the television and always seeing himself.
Still, Baker is trying. Clive Anderson's on-screen persona in Clive Anderson
Talks Back is one of scarcely controlled panic, which infects the audience
with contrived hysteria. It is like a gaggle of the condemned trying to
cheer themselves up on the way to the gallows. Consciously or not, Anderson
subverts the format by constantly reminding his guests, this week John
Prescott and Griff Rhys Jones, of the conversations they had last time they
were on his show. This was jolly useful for Jones, who seemed to think he
could earn his fee just by grinning. Only Patrick Moore, as loony as only a
moon-gazer can be, added a glimmer of spontaneity to a sad 40 minutes.
You know chat shows are dead because those traditional artistic vultures,
the satirists, are feeding off the corpse. In Knowing me . . . knowing you
Steve Coogan, through his alter ego, Alan Partridge, perfectly captures the
tetchiness that often lies just under the smooth veneer of the hosts, along
with their vanity and the phoney matiness. His show has taken time to gel,
but last week was spot on with a reproof for the bandmaster who attempted a
little improvisation; a dire medley duet of Abba songs with the visiting
American 'star'; and a well set up climax as Partridge, lounging in the
jacuzzi awaiting the raunchiest team of dancers in Europe, was confronted by
five male strippers.
Sometimes Partridge is too subtle for the format and there is no obvious way
for the programme to progress. He could follow the lead of the American
precursor, The Larry Sanders Show, where actor Garry Shandling has opened
the programme out to portray Sanders, a tub of indecisiveness, tussling with
his manager, his feed, and his wife.
After an excess of crime programmes, both factual and fictional, The Nick
finally looks like the real thing. Producer Paul Berriff may have marked his
card by taking his cameras to one of the busiest police stations in the
country, Gipton in Leeds, but for once it all rings true - the role of the
police as social workers, the terrible impact of crime on the victims, the
alienation from society of the submerged tenth.
There is no attempt to build up heroes. Indeed, the first programme revealed
the unglamorous working conditions of the police and the mundane sordidity
of most crimes. There was also no attempt to show the Force as particularly
successful - after a hair-raising chase the driver of a stolen car got clean
away. The Nick was worth a forest of newsprint about crime and the causes of
crime. The main purpose of the police comes across as bandaging the scars of
society, and the villains are shown for what they are, destroyers of the
lives of ordinary people.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Arts: Neville's Island - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN SHUTTLEWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Surely by now it is unfair to call Tim Firth an 'Ayckbourn protege': at 29
he has a television film (Money For Nothing) and two series (All Quiet On
The Preston Front and Once Upon A Time In The North) under his belt, and has
graduated with honours from the nursery of Mr. A's Stephen Joseph Studio in
Scarborough. The format of his West End debut, directed by Jeremy Sams, is
similar to those of his erstwhile patron - adroitly crafted comedy giving
way to a dark, disquieting underside - but Firth has a voice of his own.
He economically, and almost plausibly, establishes his premise that four
middle-managers on an outdoor team awareness development course can become
marooned on an islet on Derwentwater for two days. His characters constitute
a useful assortment of types: Neville, the team leader whose inability to
see the plain truth turns out to be a paradoxical blessing; Angus, the anal,
domesticated nerd whose survival pack even includes a dinner suit and a
choice of chopping boards; Roy, vacuously born again after a
don't-mention-the-breakdown episode in his past; and Gordon, the sarcastic
git whose acerbity fuels most of the early humour.
This last character is a gift for Tony Slattery, who gives free rein to the
obnoxious side of his persona; glares of brooding incomprehension followed
by savage yet still funny Molotov coctails lobbed at the defects of his
companions. The second act's inexorable burrowing to the characters' cores
shows us what many may have wanted to achieve at one time or another:
Slattery in helpless tears of humiliation.
It is apparent almost from the outset that uncomfortable revelations are in
prospect and that the comedy of inanity (at which the script excels) will
ebb; this is a thirtysomething northern Lord Of The Flies, after all. Such
subversion of dramatic formulae is itself formulaic by now. Firth, however,
not only attains moments of Brian Patten-like lyricism during this phase,
but goes for the soul-baring with a ferocity bordering on sadism. As Angus
retreats into fretful catatonia at being a useless middle-class cuckold and
Roy - the skeleton in his psychological closet all a-clatter - retreats in
his underpants up a tree with an 18-inch knife, repeatedly bellowing the
first line of Oklahoma], the defiantly continuing laughs serve to heighten
our discomfort rather than let us off the hook.
As Christian-turned-Ancient Mariner Roy, Michael Siberry at last gets a part
which does not care about his rich, resonant voice and just lets him act.
Paul Raffield's Angus is a model of frustrated banality; and Jonathan Coy is
so skilled at underplaying that he gives Neville, the undistinguished centre
of events, few noticeable traits at all apart from befuddled amiability.
Lez Brotherston's remarkable set of tangled timber, gravel and part of the
lake, around which the actors squelch with increasing mania, is an apt
environment for a play which refuses either to subside into easy laughter or
to plonk sententiously into the realms of earnestness, but straddles both
registers like a grimly cackling bastard.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Arts: Yevgeny Onegin - Opera in Mezieres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If there is an operatic event unique to Switzerland, it must be the annual
late-summer production at Mezieres, a farming community in the rolling
countryside north of Vevey.
The Theatre du Jorat resembles an extended barn, not much altered since it
was built in 1908. It has primitive facilities, wooden benches and no
heating. Acoustics and sightlines are good. The place has a knack of
inspiring festival standards - but the atmosphere front-of-house is informal
and unpretentious. This is popular art at its best.
We have to thank Renee Auphan - now in her final season as director of the
Opera Lausanne before moving to Geneva - for making the most of Mezieres
these past ten years. The small pit limits the choice of repertoire, but she
has proved resourceful. We have had Gluck, Monteverdi and Mozart. This year
she chose Yevgeny Onegin, in the original orchestration for 32 musicians.
The idea was to restore some of the artless simplicity Tchaikovsky had in
mind when he handed its premiere to students of the Moscow Conservatory. And
so the conductor, Louis Langree, was despatched to Russia to find the
correct instrumental parts.
In the end, the music sounded impoverished: perhaps we have become too
accustomed to big-house Tchaikovsky. But Langree's hasty tempi did not help,
and the strings of the Lausanne Chamber Orchestra sounded thin and wiry.
The real rewards were to be found on stage, in a production by Patrice
Caurier and Moshe Leiser which spoke volumes with modest resources - at
least in the first two acts. The wood-panelled veranda and interiors at the
Larin estate were a natural extension of the theatre's own decor. Here was a
pastoral idyll, a natural frame for intimate scenes. But the designer,
Christian Ratz, failed to find an appropriate metaphor for the St Petersburg
act, which unfolded on a dark, snow-covered driveway. Sub-zero temperatures
are hardly conducive to ruminating about love.
The cast was full of young, international singers making useful careers.
Gino Quilico's Onegin was irresistible - a bearded beau of impeccable vocal
distinction. His cool vanity worked well at first - this was a man for whom
swooning women were clearly an everyday occurence. But his failure to
register so much as a hint of vulnerability robbed the finale of poignancy.
The other men were very much in his shadow. Marcus Haddock made a
well-schooled Lensky, though the voice never really bloomed. Romuald
Tesarowicz was the dutiful Gremin.
The women had more to say. Bernadette Antoine's Larina, for example, cut an
unusually chic and gracious figure, not unlike the ageing matrons you see
around Lausanne. Gabriela Popescu's sumptuous mezzo was heard to advantage
as Olga.
Michal Shamir's Tatyana lacked tonal sweetness, but offered compensation in
her portrait of repressed passion - pale and anorexic at the start, a girl
with a Mills and Boon idea of love. The naive obsession of the Letter Scene
was powerfully conveyed, verging on hysteria in the exchanges with Jocelyne
Taillon's classic Filipyevna. This was the dramatic watershed, giving the
rest of the performance an unfair sense of deflation.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Arts: 'Hamlet' without the prince
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Birmingham Stage Company has been humouring the Hollywood actor Richard
Dreyfuss, whose ambition was to direct Hamlet. This production at the
Birmingham Old Rep marks his directorial debut and makes an evening of dire
embarrassment. The text is cut to three hours including two intervals; it is
a Coles Notes of a production - a summary of key points and key characters
(no Fortinbras), with the key speeches all left in. Classroom didacticism
sets the tone for Russell Boulter's 'To be or not to be'. He scrapes on the
floor with chalk, just as he had earlier chalked 'Claudius' as if on the
tables of his memory; and chops up the famous speech into ponderable nuggets
like a schoolmaster at a blackboard, using a great deal of sign language. I
half-expected him to flourish an eraser at 'ay, there's the rub'.
Such a pun would have been in keeping with the levity of his first meeting
with Horatio, the joke about the funeral meats coldly furnishing the
marriage tables being delivered like a line by Ernie Wise. No mordant
melancholy, inward searching, and philosophical ardour here. This is Hamlet
as a plain, honest, reasonably intelligent young bloke, bounding through the
play like an excitable young hound, lashing out at lover and mother, but
enjoying himself the while, and perfectly amiable to the end. He evinces no
psychological need for soliloquies, but these at least are clearly spoken,
not like Claudius's soliloquy as given by George Irving, an indecipherable
mumble.
It may be that Dreyfuss dangerously intends to link Claudius and the Queen
through poor articulation which betrays weakness of character. Certainly
Irving's flat nasal vowels, glib but stumbling diction, and reliance on a
still flappier sign language than Boulter's Hamlet are consistent with a
shifty, amoral figure, over-anxious to persuade. Celia Montague's Gertrude
presents a thoroughly superficial woman, bland-voiced as a bored and
high-class London secretary. 'There is a willow grows askant the brook' is
pure Home Counties. An opening tableau is imposed of Claudius and Queen in
lustful embrace; and she goes as far in connivance with him - or is it
really true love? - as to brandish a pocket-knife when he is threatened by
Laertes.
But I was more inclined to feel that the diction should simply be improved,
and that of the gruffly Irish Laertes (Paudge Behan) and gabbling Horatio
(Neal Foster) also. Steven Berkoff as the taped voice of the Ghost has his
diction electronically treated, which confirms the resemblance of the actor
miming the role to a gyrating Cyberman; but these fantastically distended
vowels do provide a theatrical frisson. Bernard Kay is a nasty rather than a
foolish Polonius, his prating very much abridged. Daniele Lydon's Ophelia
has an aptly pre-Raphaelite prettiness and fragility though a fruity enough
voice. The clumsiness of the staging is such that when Laertes leaps into
her grave, Hamlet, Horatio and the grave-digger (Kay again) are already
inside it, watching for the corpse to descend.

One of the most intriguing of all historical mysteries concerns the violent
fall of the Romanov dynasty. Tsar Nicholas II, his wife and their five
children were all allegedly shot to death by Bolsheviks in 1918; yet rumours
that the Tsar's youngest daughter, Anastasia, survived the massacre have
continued to circulate. Equinox (9.00, Channel 4) investigates the riddle,
and unearths new evidence on the claim of an American woman, Anna Anderson,
to be the last of the Romanovs.
The Chinese film director Zhang Yimou has acquired a sizeable following in
the West; now that no-one worries about the cult of the personality any
more, it is fitting that he should be the focus of a documentary profile.
Big Fish in China, (11.00, Channel 4 ) concentrates on his remarkable work
and his relationship with his leading lady and real-life partner Gong Li.
Aficionados of the dreadful comedy follow-up movie will find appalling jokes
and contrived resolutions aplenty in tonight's main films: Any Which Way You
Can (7.00, BBC1) and Cannonball Run II (Carlton, 8.00).

FT  05 OCT 94 / Management: Three ways to be a better parent - Book review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trapped inside this how-to manual for corporate strategists is a more
radical book. The question the authors of Corporate-level strategy: creating
value in the multibusiness company raise but never quite tackle is: why
should diversified business companies exist?
Again and again, the book emphasises how hard it is for a parent company to
add value to its operating businesses, how easy to damage them. The authors,
Michael Goold, Andrew Campbell and Marcus Alexander, members of London's
Ashridge Strategic Management Centre, say their research suggests that 'a
few multibusiness companies have corporate strategies that create
substantial value'. But 'the majority do not; they are value destroyers'.
To avoid this, big-company managers must strive for 'parenting advantage':
the businesses must be better off than on their own, and better off than
with any other parent. The book is about how to ensure this.
The basic tool is something that two of the authors, Goold and Campbell,
introduced in their influential 1987 book, Strategies and Styles. They argue
that there are three approaches a parent company can take to its businesses:
financial control, strategic planning, and strategic control.
The first, best exemplified in the UK by Hanson or BTR, gives individual
managers freedom to run the businesses as they want, as long as they meet
demanding short-term financial targets. The second, strategic planning,
yields parents 'closely involved with their businesses in developing plans
and strategies,' emphasising long-term goals. IBM is an example, as is
Canon, the camera and office equipment company. The third approach,
strategic control, falls midway between the others.
Parent companies must decide which style to use, the authors say, and apply
it consistently across their portfolio of companies, which itself must
comprise businesses likely to benefit. If there are misfits, it is easier to
change the portfolio than the style.
This approach forces managers to think clearly about what parenting
involves. The authors have little patience with traditional answers. Finance
and central services are easily obtained elsewhere, usually on better terms;
merely offering a second opinion 'seldom justifies its cost'; to say the
parent is needed to help subsidiaries think strategically is 'arrogant and
wrong'.
Instead, the authors say, managers must seek bigger 'parenting
opportunities', through 'value creation insights', supported by 'distinctive
parenting characteristics' and appropriate 'mental maps', applied to the
right 'heartland businesses'.
Some of the insights cited are shrewd, others bathetic. Put crude-ly, the
one for BTR is that a tough parent can force subsidiaries to jack up prices
faster than they otherwise would. To be fair, the authors say real value
comes not from the insights but from underpinning them with clear and
consistent corporate habits.
A weakness at the heart of the book lies in the three styles on which the
authors base their analysis. Arguably, the financial control style is a
distinctively British approach; in the US only Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
springs to mind as a fellow member of the club. The authors cite few
successful western examples of the strategic planning style, though they
argue that it is common in Japan.
That leaves most western companies trapped in variations of the strategic
control style. For them, the liberation offered by the range of potential
styles is illusory; in practice, the issues are tediously familiar. Should
we have a matrix structure, or worldwide business units, or country units?
Which is more important, the operating budget or the strategic plan? Is this
proposed acquisition in a business we understand, or is the apparent
similarity a trap? Parenting analysis throws some light on all this, but the
knotty problems remain.
An unaddressed issue is whether successful parents can continue to add value
to subsidiaries once they have achieved the one-off gain of teaching their
managers the lessons of shareholder value.
Which is where we came in: such transitions apart, what is the economic role
of the multibusiness company?
Perhaps such giants survive, protected by their inherited control of brands
and shelf-space, partly because big companies find it easier to deal with
companies of similar size. These forces of inertia are reinforced by
familiar capital market imperfections, notably the gap between shareholders
and managers. Together, these forces ensure immunity for all but the most
egregious value-destroyers. The authors provide a useful guide to avoiding
such a fate; but the wider questions they raise remain. * Published by John

FT  05 OCT 94 / People: Watkins joins board of Senior Engineering
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Watkins, former deputy chairman and chief executive of London
Transport, was yesterday appointed a non-executive director of Senior
Engineering, the tubular products, ducting and thermal engineering company .
Earlier this year, Watkins had been in line to take over as LT's new
chairman, but the appointment was apparently blocked by the government
because of his sharply-worded criticisms of cuts in LT's budget.
Watkins' appointment at Senior is his first since quitting LT, and something
of a coup for the Rickmansworth-based group.
He had a long career at Lucas Industries before becoming chief executive of
Hawker Siddeley, before its acquisition by BTR. He is also a non-executive
director of Dobson Park Industries, the mining equipment company.
Don McFarlane, Senior's chairman, said that Watkins, at 56, was 'just the
age we were looking for - he has plenty of energy and drive, but also brings
years of experience.'

FT  05 OCT 94 / People: Wheelock NatWest chooses chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Miller, 46, former head of Jardine Fleming's Japanese operations, has
become chief executive of Wheelock NatWest, the new Asian merchant bank
being set up by National Westminster Bank and Wheelock, the 137-year-old
Hong Kong trading house.
Miller joined merchant bankers Robert Fleming as a graduate trainee in 1972,
and was seconded to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority in the late 1970s.
After a brief stint as a Fleming pension fund manager, he joined Jardine
Fleming, the Hong Kong merchant bank jointly owned with Jardine Matheson.
Miller, who was deputy chairman of Fleming Securities when he left in 1991,
is coy about the reasons for his departure.
He says that when he returned to head office from the Far East it 'did not
work out'. He left in 1992 to run the UK arm of State Street Bank Global
Advisors, part of the Boston-based fund management group.
Jardine Fleming has only been going for 25 years yet is Hong Kong's oldest,
most profitable merchant bank. Last year it made net profits of Dollars 210m
and contributed a substantial part of the profits of the privately-owned
Robert Fleming group.
Miller is the second ex-Jardine Fleming man recruited by Wheelock Natwest.
Nick Sibley, 56, one of two joint deputy chairmen, ran Jardine Fleming in
Hong Kong in the early 1970's. He too found it hard to adjust when recalled
to Flemings' London HQ. Sibley moved to BZW, then Wheelock Marden, where he
has the job of setting up the new venture, which has an authorised share
capital of Dollars 200m.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Management: No need for excuses - Michael Hammer and Steven
Stanton parry criticisms of re-engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HAMMER and STEVEN STANTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suddenly, it is open season on re-engineering. While 18 months ago the term
was known only to a handful of cognoscenti, today we are besieged by
self-proclaimed 'experts' who busily assure all who will listen that
re-engineering is too radical, insufficiently radical or nothing new. Many
of these 'experts' do not know what re-engineering really is and have no
first-hand experience of it.
These critics are merely taking advantage of the fact that since the media
are always hungry for controversy, a dissenting voice will usually attract
attention.
Since re-engineering has been phenomenally successful in many companies, and
since the term has entered the general lexicon, asserting that it is bunk
comes under the heading of man bites dog and may well get someone some
notoriety.
One give-away to the emptiness of such claims is that they are rarely
substantiated by any specifics: no review of cases, extensive anecdotal
experience or statistical data. In order to bolster their claims, however,
some of the critics do slip in one bit of data: that re-engineering has a
very high failure rate, often cited as 70 per cent. This 'fact', the critics
claim, proves that re-engineering does not work.
The use of this datum proves the critics' ignorance of re-engineering in two
ways. First, we find it breathtaking when the 70 per cent figure is cited as
an authoritative statement of re-engineering's successes and failures
because we happen to know its source: one of us made it up.
Obviously, the figure was not manufactured from the whole cloth, but was
based on experience with companies attempting re-engineering. Nonetheless,
it was only intended as a qualitative assessment. Moreover, that statement
was made in late 1992 and its relevance in late 1994 is modest at best.
Second, the statement was a descriptive assertion, not a predictive one. It
merely observed that approximately 70 per cent of the re-engineering efforts
that we had seen had not ended successfully. It implied nothing about the
expected rate of success or failure of subsequent re-engineering efforts. To
believe otherwise would be to believe that re-engineering's success rate is
a matter of luck. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Success or failure at re-engineering is determined by a company's
understanding of it, the ability to execute it and the executives'
commitment to it. Re-engineering has no natural failure rate. Those who do
it right succeed; those who do not fail. In 1992, few companies knew what
they were about and so re-engineering had a high mortality rate. Today there
is little excuse.
What then are the primary causes of re-engineering failure? They fall into
two groups. The first we call failures of intellect, where a company simply
does not know what it is doing. Enthusiasm and a desire for breakthrough
results are not sufficient to yield re-engineering success. One has to know
what one is about, and if one does not, one can expect problems.
There are many traps into which companies unprepared for re-engineering and
left to their own devices are likely to fall. One common error is expending
too much time and energy on an analysis of the organisation's current
operations. Since re-engineering entails discarding current process designs
and starting again with a clean sheet of paper, virtually everything learned
in such an exercise is destined for the rubbish heap. Those conducting such
a study inevitably become captives of the existing way of doing things.
After an extensive analysis, the old ways start to make sense to the
analysts; they develop proprietary interest in the old processes; and their
ability to think creatively is seriously and perhaps permanently impaired.
In spite of its obvious dangers, it is easy to fall victim to the analysis
temptation. Conducting an analysis is comfortable and postpones that fateful
day when sweeping changes will have to be made.
There are numerous other such re-engineering pitfalls, easy to fall into but
also relatively easy to avoid: timidity in redesign, stretching out a
re-engineering programme over a lengthy time frame, focusing on
organisational units rather than on value-creating processes, and so on.
Today, we have a substantial body of expertise about re-engineering so that
companies that make these errors have only themselves to blame. Their
failure is a commentary on their lack of preparation and experience rather
than an indictment of re-engineering.
However, re-engineering expertise is by itself not enough to guarantee
success. Without committed executive leadership even the most intelligently
planned re-engineering programme will fail. Re-engineering entails sweeping
change to an organisation. When a company's operating procedures are
rethought from the ground up, virtually every other aspect of the company is
called into question: the content of people's jobs, the structure of the
organisation, the mechanisms for reward and compensation, even the cultural
norms that govern attitudes and behaviour. These must all be consistent with
the ways in which the organisation's work is being performed, and changes in
how the work is performed will be reflected in all these other arenas.
Re-engineering therefore entails an unprecedented degree of organisational
change. For that reason, we eschew the oft-used phrase 'business process
re-engineering' (BPR), because it is too limiting, suggesting as it does
that the process alone is the target of re-engineering.
While re-engineering does begin with process redesign, it does not end
there; the ripple effects are felt everywhere. Such mult-dimensional change
can only be effected from the top of the organisation. Only senior
executives have the authority to institute such changes: to reassign
personnel, to recalibrate measurement and reward systems, to institute new
organisational structures, and to compel the participation of those who
might prefer to give the whole thing a miss.
The other main cause of re-engineering failure is the absence of such
executive leadership. Many executives claim they want the dramatic results
that re-engineering promises but are unwilling to follow its consequences or
are reluctant to pursue the effort with the vigour that it requires.
Failures of intellect and character are encountered when an organisation has
developed a superficial attachment to the concept of re-engineering but has
not invested in the training needed to make it work and does not have the
cadre of senior leaders needed to see it through. The failure of these
companies is both predictable and avoidable, and says nothing about
re-engineering itself. To paraphrase Shakespeare, 'the fault is not in
re-engineering, but in ourselves'.

FT  05 OCT 94 / People: New style for fashion retailer New Look
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
New Look, the Dorset-based women's wear retailer which has just opened its
first London outlet on Oxford Street, is preparing itself for flotation by
bringing on to its board a non-executive chairman and two non-executive
directors.
Unusually, founder Tom Singh has retained for himself only the position of
deputy chairman; John Hanna, the managing director, is in day-to-day charge.
The new chairman, 53-year-old Louis Sherwood, right, has been picked not for
his experience in fashion but for his knowledge of retailing generally.
A former personal assistant to James Gulliver at Fine Fare, Sherwood then
spent 13 years in Sir James Goldsmith's empire, initially with
Anglo-Continental, later in the US at Grand Union.
In 1985 he became president of US supermarket chain A&amp;P, returning to the UK
three years later to be chairman and chief executive of Gateway Foodmarkets.
Following Isoceles' acquisition of Gateway in 1989, he was brought in by the
bankers as non-executive chairman following the ill-fated management buy-out
of Magnet, the fitted kitchens retailer.
He is now chairman of HTV Group, the ITV company for the west of England and
Wales.
Also joining the board is Howard Perlin, a non-executive director of Pentos,
who until March had been director of acquisitions and disposals at Sears.
Perlin, 47, says he was impressed by New Look: 'It appears to have
eliminated the sort of hiccups you so often see in the fashion business'.
Sales have grown by an average annual compound rate of about 50 per cent a
year for the past five years.
The feminine perspective is provided by 38-year-old Sue Farr, head of
marketing and publicity for BBC Network Radio.
A graduate trainee at Northern Foods, she moved around the advertising world
before becoming director of corporate communications for Thames TV. She
joined the BBC last year.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Recruitment: Zen and the art of finding a true vocation -
The use of psychoanalytical techniques for those seeking a new career
direction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You had to feel sorry for Dermot. As much as he looked at the ceiling or
closed his eyes and tried to blot out the surroundings he could not secure
an image. His mind was blank.
'I can't see anything at all,' he confessed. Dermot was lying on a blanket
in a room with eight other people variously lying or sitting staring into
space. Had this been a forest in California with men in lumberjack shirts
pounding tom toms in a male bonding session it might have been more readily
explained.
But this was a mixed group of men and women - English to boot - on a floor
of the building that houses one of the world's biggest accountancy firms.
Outside in the City of London people were making money, doing deals,
catching cabs.
Inside, sandwiched between the upper and lower floors of the Farringdon
Street accountancy offices of KPMG Peat Marwick, its career consultancy arm
was running a visioning workshop, one of the more ethereal sides of
outplacement.
Outplacement, the structured approach to helping people in redundancy
programmes to find new jobs, is also designed to enable people to come to
terms with their job loss. A trend in the US which has now become
established in the UK has been to develop visioning courses designed to
enable people to think more deeply about their work and discover what they
really want to do in life.
Psychologists at KPMG Career Consultants have evolved a series of visioning
sessions that use self-awareness processes, drawing on Zen Buddhism and
meditation techniques. If this sounds like a throw-back to the 1960s it
might explain why visioning is proving popular with the 'thirty and forty
somethings'.
Take Dermot, for example. Aged about 40 and married to a successful medical
consultant, he had worked as an accountant for the same company for 17 years
when he was given the opportunity to take voluntary redundancy.
'My job became redundant. I was offered another position in the company but
didn't want it.' He and his wife had made a conscious decision as a couple,
he said, that her job would come first. Her earnings and his redundancy
package had offered him the luxury of taking time to consider what he wanted
to do next.
Since giving up his job he had completed an MBA course and now wanted to
discover a personal goal. 'I want to build my own vision,' he said. Sadly,
it was proving difficult.
Dermot was lying on the blanket, undergoing a guided imagery session. This
is where the consultant running the group asks those present to expel all
thoughts from their minds and concentrate on a particular image - in this
case it was a rose.
We were asked to think of the petals opening and to imagine something coming
out of the middle. What was it and how did we react to it? Poor Dermot just
wasn't receiving anything.
While some people were seeing blue roses, roses with spiral staircases going
down their stems or with women coming out of them, Dermot confessed that he
saw 'nothing at all. It was too much effort to create a picture,' he said.
This was a morning session. Fortunately for Dermot the afternoon involved
less creative thought and he did finally get the hang of it. Clients were
asked to list key events in their past, something which they considered an
important stepping stone in their life, and then to analyse the
circumstances that led up to the event and its outcome. From that they were
asked to sift out two or three important points which brought about the
change.
Another exercise was for participants to imagine themselves a year on,
having lunch with a friend or colleague and discussing particular
achievements that year.
Some of this, conceded David Royston-Lee, the consultant running the
session, might be regarded as airy fairy but those who have attended such
courses tend to be positive about their benefits.
Patricia Manning, former marketing director of Mothercare, the Storehouse
chain, who is currently on an outplacement course at KPMG, said: 'I thought
when I went in that if this was going to be one of those feel-good days I
didn't want to know, because I don't feel bad. In fact I found it very
useful.'
Coming from a solid corporate background, she is about to make a big career
change by setting up in business as a management and marketing consultant.
'One thing you do in the sessions is to look back at the most important
parts of your corporate past and draw out from them the things that are
going to be at the core of your own consultancy. That is difficult to do
sometimes on your own.'
Manning, a Californian who has lived in the UK for 16 years, said that
people seemed to value the opportunity to take some time out of their life
and look back at it in an environment where in-bred or company inspired
self-restraint is absent.
'For the British that's a difficult thing to do but there was no holding
back in our session,' she added.
One outcome was that everyone finished the day firm friends because they all
knew so much about each other.
The sessions tend to expose suppressed career longings. One bank executive
confessed that he had always wanted to be a lion-tamer. While there were
obvious practical difficulties in achieving this ambition, the counsellors
drew out qualities from the job - in this case, perhaps, it was controlling
a dangerous situation - and helped him to apply it to a career where this
ability was required.
David Royston-Leesaid that he often comes across people in well-paid jobs
who are frustrated because they really want to do something else but which
they know pays much less than they can earn in their chosen career.
He recalled a conveyancing lawyer who wanted to be an opera singer but knew
it would not pay for the upkeep of his wife and family. His personal crisis
had been caused by a fall-off in the work that had been earning him Pounds
150,000 a year.
He is now in the chorus of a London operatic company, having at least
partially fulfilled his ambition. The visioning did not solve his money
problems but it did make him realise that there was something that mattered
more to him than his day job in terms of personal satisfaction and that if
he organised himself he could do both.
'Many of us have something we want to do but find that it is too big a leap.
What we don't always see is that there are stepping stones to making these
things happen,' said Royston-Lee. 'There is a hell of a lot of guilt around
in terms of doing what we feel we should do and not what we want to do. The
visioning day simply says that it's OK to be selfish sometimes.'
Such therapy, once the preserve of Hollywood film stars, is becoming
increasingly available in companies. Jo Ouston, a former head of advisory
services at the Institute of Management, now an independent career
management consultant, has developed a series of techniques, including the
use of guided imagery and transactional analysis, a method developed in the
late 1950s by US psychologist Eric Berne.
Ouston offers a series of structured courses at her consultancy or can go
into companies to help solve a problem. These are often associated with an
individual who may have found himself in the wrong job or who is not sure
what the company requires of him.
'These people are sometimes valued by the company but difficult to manage.
It is often the rebels I'm dealing with, which I like because they are often
the most interesting people,' she said.
Jo Ouston is based at 51/52 Keyes House, Dolphin Square, London SW1V 3LX,

FT  05 OCT 94 / Business and the Environment: Malls get a mauling - The
growing resistance to America's drive-in shopping centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every morning, millions of Americans roll out of bed and into their cars.
They drive to work, drive to lunch, drive to a mall for some shopping, drive
to the supermarket and drive home again.
It is the American dream: a well-paid job, easy access to consumer goods and
a house in the suburbs. To a small but increasingly vocal group, however, it
is the American nightmare. Car dependency, they say, exacerbates air
pollution and reduces wilderness areas and open space by encouraging
suburban sprawl.
Large suburban shopping complexes have become a target for their campaign.
Wal-Mart, one of the most successful and aggressive retailers in the US, is
bearing the brunt of the campaign, concentrated in New England. In August,
St Johnsbury became the first city in Vermont to accept the store, after
years of bitter opposition across the state.
Wal-Mart hailed its entry into Vermont as a victory, but the company made
some significant compromises. The store reduced its planned size from about
120,000 sq ft to about 80,000 sq ft and agreed to locate in the downtown
area rather than on the city fringes.
Town councils and local referendums in Bath in Maine, Saugus, Greenfield and
Westford in Massachusetts and Lebanon, New Hampshire have already rejected
Wal-Mart. The anti-Wal-Mart campaign has gained momentum in Plymouth and
Sturbridge in Massachussetts, St Albans and Williston in Vermont, and North
Kingston in Rhode Island.
Other retailers are also under fire. Cape Cod is seeking to keep out the
discount store Costco, and anti-marters are hoping to prevent Kmart from
building in Wallingford, Connecticut.
Resistance to shopping malls is mounting in urban centres too. Plans for a
gigantic new mall in the city of Providence, Rhode Island, have raised the
ire of environmentalists who complain that a 5,000-space parking garage will
encourage shoppers to drive to the mall and turn the area into one big
traffic jam.
The Providence Place developers argue that shuttle buses and a two-person
per car minimum for parking will solve the problem.
The retail chains also point to the economic stimulus they bring to a
community. Wal-Mart argues that each store it builds brings up to 250 new
jobs.
'We add jobs, which are of paramount importance everywhere,' says Donald
Shinkle, spokesman for the group. 'By selling our products cheaply, we also
extend the shopping budgets of every family in the area.'
The chief fear of Wal-Mart detractors is that an outlet will sap business
from town centres. Dying downtowns lead to sprawl and more traffic as large
car parks spread, they say.
But Wal-Mart counters that in many areas its presence has benefited downtown
businesses by attracting more out-of-town shoppers from far away.
Wal-Mart is now running television commercials portraying the retailer as an
environmentally-conscious family store. The advertisements feature a
Wal-Mart built with recycled materials, and workers who host sales of baked
goods for charity on their days off.
Anti-marters are sceptical. They say the economic benefits are
insubstantial.
'Most of the jobs Wal-Mart creates are minimum wage,' says Albert Norman, an
anti-mart activist in Greenfield. 'And when you count the number of jobs
lost as the downtown stores go out of business, it's a wash.
'It also doesn't count the added infrastructure the town needs to spend
money on like more traffic lights and road repair. The prices may be low now
but if Wal-Mart eliminates the competition, they'll have lots of room to
raise prices,' he adds.
So far, the anti-mall groups have operated only locally, but some are
linking with other campaigners.
'We are starting to share ideas and strategies with other, similar groups
around the country,' says Joan Pucino, head of the No-Mart Coalition of
residents in North Kingston, Rhode Island. Lewis Milford, a lawyer with The
Conservation Law Foundation, says his organisation is planning to get more
involved, but adds that environmental groups have been slow to respond.
Although the environmental dangers are seen as serious, many involved in
urban planning development say suburban retailers are not entirely to blame.
A number of businesses locate on highway developments including banks, car
dealers, fast food restaurants, condominiums and suburban office complexes.
'The retailers are scapegoats,' says Alex Krieger, director of the urban
design programme at Harvard University. 'It's easy to target them because
they're very big, they tend to replace local shops, and they're seen as
large-scale intruders.'

FT  05 OCT 94 / Business and the Environment: Where there's muck, there's
grass - Slag today, land tomorrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON

<TEXT>
King Canute would not have approved of the method, but the land reclamation
scheme in the southern Taiwanese port of Kaohsiung is sure to be watched
with interest by the Netherlands.
Kaohsiung is reclaiming coastland using non-hazardous industrial waste as
fill instead of sand and gravel. The project creates much-needed new land -
an expensive and highly sought-after commodity in the crowded, heavily
industrialised city. It also provides a practical way to dispose of
materials which were previously dumped offshore.
The city government plans to reclaim up to 200ha (494 acres) of land by the
end of the century. Begun in 1989, reclamation of the first 50ha will be
completed by the end of this year. It will be used to build a public sports
park and recreation area. Uses for land still to be reclaimed have yet to be
decided.
Kaohsiung's environmental protection bureau conceived the South Star project
as a stop-gap measure to prevent further erosion of the shoreline south of
the city, but it has since evolved into a more ambitious reclamation
project.
South Star is using slag produced by the state-owned China Steel Corp, fly
ash generated by the state power company, Taiwan Power Co, and construction
rubble. Even the sea walls are made with recycled material  - primarily a
concrete using slag powder and slag aggregate. About 200,000 old tyres will
be used to protect them from erosion.
The project is economical as well as environmentally friendly, according to
the environmental protection bureau. It says the cost of building the sea
walls was half the price it would have been using conventional construction
methods.
The project that most closely resembles the South Star reclamation is the
new Kansai airport in Osaka, Japan, says Liu Chia-nan, deputy commissioner
of the bureau of environmental protection.
'The concept is similar, but compressed garbage was used for fill at Kansai,
and now the airport is experiencing problems with subsidence,' Liu says.
'However, our method is quite stable because the materials we are using for
fill are solid.'
Future reclamation projects intend to use other waste material, including
ash produced by Kaohsiung's several planned garbage incinerators.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Business and the Environment: Power to the petrol - John
Griffiths finds battery cars cannot keep up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 2015, most cars will still be powered by conventional petrol or diesel
engines, with battery-powered cars and alternative fuels relegated to the
'politically correct fringe', according to a research report from The
Economist Intelligence Unit.
It also takes a strongly pessimistic view of the prospects for
hydrogen-powered cars, on which several leading manufacturers are working as
one of the most promising alternatives to battery vehicles in the search for
environmentally 'clean' private transport.
The 200-page study* appears to reinforce the arguments of the US 'big three'
car makers, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, that electric vehicle
technology is not sufficiently advanced for viable battery cars to go on
sale in California in 1998 in line with state environmental legislation.
Under directives drawn up by the Californian Air Resources Board (Carb), and
which are being copied by some other US states, 2 per cent of a car maker's
Californian sales must be zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) in 1998, rising to
10 per cent by 2007.
The penalty for non-compliance could be exclusion from the Californian new
car market, which with well over 1m sales a year is bigger than that of many
countries.
No mainstream car maker could contemplate such a prospect, so all are
developing electric cars to meet the deadline, despite reservations about
their cost and whether they will have adequate range for the sprawling
greater Los Angeles area, where California's air pollution problems are
concentrated.
The EIU report concentrates on what it describes as the 'extreme
inefficiency' of batteries as a means of storing energy, maintaining that
150 conventional lead acid batteries, weighing several tonnes, would be
needed to store the equivalent energy of a tankful of petrol.
Even the most advanced forms of battery now at the research and development
stage would only improve the situation by a factor of three, according to
the report. 'But each of these batteries also suffers from technical
problems of one kind or another, as well as from very high cost.'
However, despite many months of lobbying by the motor industry, Carb and
other states' clean-air authorities are showing little inclination to dilute
or delay their legislation.
And with no hydrogen-fuelled or other alternative zero-emissions vehicle on
the immediate horizon, the Carb directive is effectively ordering
manufacturers to produce battery-powered cars or EVs (electric vehicles).
However, it cannot order motorists to buy them at prices which -
unsubsidised - could be double that of a conventional family car. So most
initial production will go to concerns such as power-generating utilities
with a vested interest in the vehicles' long-term success. Sales to private
motorists will have to be subsidised by the conventional cars their makers
sell in much larger numbers.
General Motors is providing the most visible evidence that electric cars
will be available from 1998.
It has just finished building a fleet of 30 models based on the Impact, a
prototype unveiled about three years ago. The fleet is starting trials,
under a programme called PrEView, in Los Angeles and will be evaluated,
along with prototype systems for recharging the vehicles, by 1,000 drivers
of widely varying types and needs over the next two years.
Ken Baker, vice-president of GM's research and development centre, insists
that 'GM wants electric vehicles to be a marketplace success. The PrEView
drive will help us understand the potential EV customer and help take us one
step closer to making EVs a reality.'
All other problems such as cost apart, the programme should go a long way
towards establishing whether the cars' estimated average range of 70 miles
using lead acid batteries - rather than the more advanced, costly and
commercially not yet available nickel cadmium ones of the prototype - really
is of any practical use to most Los Angelinos.

FT  05 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Ending Clause 4 cuts ties
with past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The words have been inscribed on every membership card issued by the Labour
party since 1918.
Clause 4 of the party's constitution, committing the party to the 'common
ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange', is the
symbol of Labour's attachment to a collectivist past.
Mr Tony Blair promised when he was elected as leader to abandon that past.
His call yesterday for a fundamental overhaul of the party's constitution
was the proof of his serious intent.
The terms of the surprise proposal - a call for a clear, up-to-date
statement of the party's objectives instead of a blunt repudiation of Clause
4 - were framed to avoid immediate controversy on the conference floor.
The emphasis deliberately was on the new statement of aims and values which
he will present jointly with Mr John Prescott to the party's national
executive. The conference applauded loudly, although it did not quite know
what it was cheering.
But there was no doubt about Mr Blair's intentions. Labour has abandoned the
pretence that it can run a command economy, that it can re-nationalise the
privatised industries, and that the state knows better than the market.
It is time, the new leader has decided, for the rhetoric of the constitution
to catch up with the reality.
He was confident yesterday that the move will succeed, that he will not
suffer the ignominious defeat inflicted 35 years ago on the then Labour
leader Hugh Gaitskell by the party's traditionalists. Then, Mr Gaitskell's
vain attempt to scrap Clause 4 destroyed his leadership.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the architect of the painful modernisation process which
started in 1983, thought about taking up the fight again before the 1992
general election.
But after forcing the party to abandon the policies which once gave
substance to Clause 4, he judged that a battle over the treasured words
would have been too divi-sive.
Earlier this year Mr Kinnock raised the idea in public. But his successor,
the late John Smith, decided to draw a line under constitutional change
after his bruising battle with the unions over party democracy.
In a party dogged for decades by a culture of struggle and fears of betrayal
by the leadership, many of the traditionalists still regard Clause 4 as the
litmus test of its socialist credentials.
It was clear from the words yesterday of Mr Arthur Scargill, the miners'
leader, that the unreconstructed left will fight Mr Blair as their
predecessors fought Mr Gaitskell. The opponents will win support among the
party's romantics.
The Labour leader has decided that he has no time for such ideological
purity. More importantly, nor do the voters who have kept his party out of
government for 15 years.
He has decided to convince the electorate that Labour really has changed.
As Mr Blair told the delegates in Blackpool: 'This is a modern party living
in an age of change. It requires a modern constitution that says what we are
in terms the public cannot misunderstand and the Tories cannot
misrepresent.'
For all their attachment to the past, most in the party look ready this time
to accept that Mr Blair is right.

'The tide of ideas in British politics is at last on the turn. For the first
time in a generation it is the rightwing that appears lost and
disillusioned'
'(The Tories') time is up. Their philosophy is done, their experiment is
over, their failure is clear. It is time to go'
'This is my socialism and we should stop apologising for using the word. It
is not the socialism of Marx or state control, it is rooted in a
straightforward view of society and the understanding that the individual
does best in a strong and decent community of people with principles and
standards'
'Tory sleaze in high places has given birth to a yob culture - Tory

FT  05 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Wooing the bosses with
chablis and canapes - Labour's meeting with business leaders on its first
ever corporate day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It had all the hallmarks of a Conservative fundraising event. Chief
executives and directors of some of Britain's biggest companies lunching on
chablis and canapes, sponsored by Philip Morris, the tobacco company, which
hired Baroness Thatcher as a consultant.
But there wasn't a Tory in sight - at least none willing to admit it. This
was the Labour party's first ever corporate day.
Ms Nicki Lewis, the party's corporate relations manager, was shepherding
captains of industry around a Blackpool hotel room to meet members of
Labour's shadow cabinet. In case the line-up was not sufficient to attract
the big names in industry, the party boosted its star quality with the
support of Mr David Puttnam, the film producer, and Mr Ken Follett, the
author.
There was little need for the supporting cast. Those attending - dubbed by
one Labour aide as Britain's deserving rich - wanted to meet the men and
women many were convinced would form a Labour cabinet.
Mr John Moores, a director of Littlewoods football pools whose family
controls about 40 per cent of the company's shares, said:  'Since Labour is
going to form the next government, it's worth getting to know them.'
For Pounds 350 per person, the executives - including Sir John Egan, chief
executive of the airports group BAA, Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the
Corporation of London's policy committee, and Mr Peter Harper, a director of
Hanson - breakfasted with Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, and Mr
Alistair Darling, the party's City spokesman.
There were also senior representatives from Tesco, the food retailer, and
Motorola, the electronics company.
The executives lunched with some of the party's most senior MPs before being
ferried back to their VIP balcony in Blackpool's Winter Gardens to hear Mr
Tony Blair give his first speech as Labour Leader.
While leftwing delegates were muttering betrayal over Mr Blair's
thinly-veiled attack on Clause 4 of the constitution, the executives were in
face-to-face conversation with the Labour leader at a drinks party he hosted
at the Imperial Hotel on the seafront.
They also sat down to a sumptuous dinner with Mr John Prescott, deputy
leader.
Not all those attending Labour's first corporate day viewed the proceedings
with unalloyed enthusiasm. Mr Cassidy was disappointed that Mr Brown did not
set out his policies or strategy for business in more detail. He also had a
blunt message for his Labour hosts - if Mr Brown's attack on the
'undeserving rich' leads to punitive taxes on foreigners, it will jeopardise
the future of the City which the corporation estimates contributes Pounds
8bn a year to the British economy.
Mr Harper of Hanson, one of the biggest corporate donors to the Conservative
party, feared his hosts had not sufficiently understood his arguments that
high dividends did not restrict investment.
'They also don't seem to understand that takeovers of companies act as a
great discipline on managers.'
But Mr Harper was delighted that he was being listened to at all. As was Sir
John, who said: 'As a privatised company we have a case to prove that we are
able to continue to generate wealth and it is encouraging that Labour want
to listen to it.'
Most companies were there for practical reasons. Mr Cassidy said: 'With only
two-and-a-half years to go to the next election Labour is ahead in the polls
by around 27 per cent.'

FT  05 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Delegate cheers conceal
unease on future policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair's standing ovation from conference delegates concealed an
undercurrent of unease about the future of the party's constitutional
commitment to public ownership.
Few went as far as Mr Arthur Scargill, the mineworkers' leader, who
described the speech as 'an outright declaration of war' on Clause 4 of the
constitution.
But Mr Dennis Skinner, the MP for Bolsover, spoke for many on the left when
he dismissed Mr Blair's proposal for a new statement of objectives as 'a
totally unnecessary diversion'.
Mr Skinner, a veteran leftwinger, said he would lead opposition to the
review on the party's national executive committee, to which he was
re-elected on Monday.
Like other leftwingers he recalled the unsuccessful 1959 attempt to drop the
public ownership clause by Hugh Gaitskell, the former Labour leader, who
claimed that it alienated voters.
'We managed to save Clause 4 of the constitution, and Harold Wilson won four
elections. It is not true that Clause 4 is a hindrance in winning power,' he
said.
Many of the delegates who cheered Mr Blair's speech appeared not to have
realised the implications of his promise to bring forward a new statement of
values.
As one shadow minister put it, the loudest noise in the conference hall 10
minutes after Mr Blair sat down was the noise of pennies dropping.
The word spread quickly. Less than an hour after Mr Blair sat down, the
Socialist Campaign Group Supporters Network began calling for a fight to
defend Clause 4.
But most delegates were willing to trust Mr Blair. 'Clause 4 is all very
well, but you can reach the same objectives by other means,' said Ms Angela
McCallum, from Central Fife.
Top union leaders were generally supportive. Mr John Edmonds, leader of the
GMB general union, said the speech had 'all the ingredients for a man who
wants to be prime minister'.
Mr Edmonds said he was reassured by the language of social justice and
public control used by Mr Blair. If Clause 4 was replaced 'by a statement
about the need for control over the most important industries in the terms
that he used, then I don't think there will be any problem'.
Mr Bill Jordan, leader of the AEEU engineering and electrical union, said Mr
Blair had delivered 'the message that the public want to hear'. Labour had
to 'break with the past, and that means tackling the sacred cows,' he said.

FT  05 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Way open to wider review of
rulebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair's pledge to redraft Labour's 'objects and objectives' will
focus on the future of the party's controversial commitment to public
ownership.
The commitment, usually referred to in verbal shorthand as Clause 4, is more
properly described as sub-clause four of Clause IV of the 13-page statement
of constitutional rules.
In language familiar to all party members the sub-clause pledges widespread
nationalisation.
Both supporters and critics of the leadership assumed that the well-known
clause would be the main target of Mr Blair's plans to modernise the party's
image.
However, modernisers pointed out that his statement also opens the way for a
much wider review of all 13 clauses in the rulebook.
Many are uncontroversial. Clause I, for example, simply states the party's
name, while others deal with issues such as membership subscriptions and the
mechanics of elections.
But there may be pressure for a fresh look at rule V7c, which requires most
members to join a union; and at Clause IX, which describes the composition
and powers of the national executive committee.
The future of the union-dominated NEC has emerged this week as a target for
change by modernising pressure groups such as the Labour Co-ordinating
Committee.
Mr Blair gave no indication of the form in which his proposals for change
will be presented. But his speech ruled out widespread state control as a
means of social change.
Using language designed to mollify opponents, he said Labour would defend
public services - including the railways and the Post Office.
Mr John Prescott, the Labour deputy leader, said the revised statement of
values would not rule out state control. 'Anything that I am involved in as
an alternative will be putting forward that public ownership still features
in the Labour approach to these matters,' he said on BBC television.
The statement is also likely to include commitments on devolution,
discrimination, trade union rights, freedom of information, democratic
rights and social justice.
Mr Blair's substantial majority on the NEC, combined with the support of Mr
Prescott, will allow him to ignore leftwing opposition in the short term.
However, amendments to the rules will have to be approved by next year's
party conference, giving rank and file critics a year to try to win
sufficient support to block any changes.

FT  05 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Blair bases vision on
opportunity and responsibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour party leader, yesterday outlined his vision of
opportunity and responsibility for all, a commitment to rebuild communities
and a series of pledges to change the constitution of both the party and the
country.
At the heart of his first leader's speech to the party conference was the
concept of a society of opportunity built around a strong and stable
economy. This meant maintaining a high and stable level of employment and a
'dynamic market economy based on partnership between government and
industry'.
A Labour government would take the lead in getting public and private
finance working together in transport and housing in capital projects in
health and education, he said.
'If there are Treasury rules or antiquated concepts of public borrowing that
hold us back, change them. That is what intelligent government is for.' It
would also mean investment in the new electronic superhighways such as
satellite and telecommunications.
But a dynamic market did not mean supporting unfettered markets or rigid
dogma, Mr Blair argued while opposing railway and Post Office privatisation.
Continuing his theme of opportunity for all Mr Blair said education would be
the passion of his government. 'I know how important the education of my
children is to me. I will not tolerate children going to run-down schools,
with bad discipline, low standards, mediocre expectation or poor teachers,
and nor should anyone else.'
Mr Blair added that responsibility must go hand-in-hand with opportunity.
Arguing that the left had undervalued the notion of responsibility and duty,
he said parents should have responsibility for their children, companies to
their employees and community, and ministers to truth.
Labour would be tough on crime, with measures to tackle juvenile offending
and a crackdown on illegal firearms, and tough on the causes of crime, with
a comprehensive crime prevention programme and an anti-drugs initiative.
Mr Blair supported the Social Justice Commission's call for a new civilian
service to enable youngsters to be given constructive tasks. He defined
responsibility as recognising that there could be no divorce from the
outside world.
He said responsibility and opportunity would require fairness and justice.
This meant a tax system that was fair and related to the ability to pay.
He promised that a future Labour government would introduce a minimum wage -
which, he said, existed in every European country and in the US  - sign the
European social chapter and give the right to people at work to join a trade
union and have that union recognised.
The obstacle in the way for Labour's plans was disillusionment with politics
itself, Mr Blair said. This meant being open and telling the truth.
Rebutting those who argued that a Labour government must repeal all Tory
trade union laws, he said: 'There is not a single person in this country who
believes that to be realistic, or that we will do it. No one believes strike
ballots should be abandoned. So why should we say it? We shouldn't, and I
won't'
He said Labour would change the rules of government, including legislating
in the first year of a government for a Scottish parliament and an assembly
for Wales.
He committed Labour to a Bill of Rights, a Freedom of Information Act,
reform of the Commons and its working practices, ending the right of
hereditary peers to vote in the House of Lords and tightening the rules of
financing of political parties.
He warned that the task of renewing the UK was not one for the
'faint-hearted or the world-weary'. By the next election voters would have
had a Conservative government for 17 or 18 years. 'They may hate them, but
they know them. I want them now to know us.'
As change would be part of that process he and Mr John Prescott, the party's
deputy leader, would be putting forward an up-to-date statement of the
objects and objectives of the party. A modern party living in a period of
change required a modern constitution, he said.

FT  05 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Unions hold back on green
vote
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of two of the biggest trade unions bolstered the show of unity by
holding back from an all-out effort to defeat environment policy objectives
they fear could threaten thousands of jobs.
The TGWU transport union and the electrical section of the AEEU did not
insist on a card vote when a statement designed to establish the party's
'green' credentials ahead of the next general election was carried on a show
of hands. The statement envisages substantial cuts in the Pounds 20bn
road-building programme, new restrictions on open-cast mining, and ending
the expansion of the nuclear power industry.
The anxieties of the unions surfaced during the debate and afterwards when
Mr Bill Morris, leader of the TGWU, revealed that he had written to Mr Smith
expressing concern about the employment implications of the policy
statement.
Mr Paul Gallagher of the electricians condemned attacks on nuclear power.
'The Tories have destroyed the coal industry to satisfy political dogma.
Labour must not make the same mistake,' he said.

FT  05 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Monks retreats from 70s deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unions want a 'social partnership' with a future Labour government, not
a return to the social-contract style deals of the 1970s when they demanded
influence in managing the economy, Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary,
said last night, Robert Taylor writes.
It is the first time a TUC general secretary has been to a Labour party
conference for more than 50 years. He told a fringe meeting he was also keen
to press the unions' policy agenda with Mr Michael Portillo, the employment
secretary. 'It may be we do not have a great deal of impact on him but if he
chooses not to consider what we have to say I believe he will have to pay a
political price for that.'
Mr Monks said: 'Despite the social advantages, 1970s style corporatism is
now as dated as kaftans and beads - and has even less chance of a comeback.
Much time and effort was spent with ministers, civil servants and employers
and their representatives. Too little time was spent in the workplaces.'
All the unions wanted now was what Mr Tony Blair had called 'fairness not
favours' partly because it would force them 'out of any temptation to rely
on cosy chats - even if lubricated with chablis and canapes in a smoke-free
zone rather than the beer, sandwiches and smoke-filled rooms of the past'.
The 'social contract' of 20 years ago had been 'too much a cosy agreement
between the unions and the government, rather than genuinely tripartite'. Mr
Monks said: 'The task now for the unions, employers and a new government is
to work out ways of regaining some of the advantages of that period without
trying to replicate structures and ideas that can no longer work.'

FT  05 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Clause 4 set to become
familiar battleground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair is renewing an old battle from a fresh starting point, Ivor
Owen writes.
When Hugh Gaitskell first sought to remove Clause 4 from the constitution it
was in the wake of the shock election defeat in 1959.
Now, in the hope of strengthening the prospects of election success, Mr
Blair returns to battle over an issue which over the years has caused deep
wounds and bitter divisions in the party.
Mr Gaitskell had to contend with opposition from his shadow cabinet, the
national executive and union bosses.
Mr Michael Foot, who by then had lost his seat as MP for Devonport, used his
position as editor of Tribune to lead a determined campaign for the
retention of Clause 4.
At a special party conference which turned into an inquest on the election
defeat Mr Gaitskell emphasised his isolation by saying he spoke for himself
alone in advocating a revision of the party's constitution.
It was left to Aneurin Bevan, deputy leader of the party, to point the way
to compromise. His insistence that a Labour government should be able to
control the 'commanding heights of the economy' provided a sufficiently
ill-defined redefinition of Clause 4 to damp down but not extinguish a
controversy which now seems set to flare again.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Share shock sparks new insight into dealing: The case behind
yesterday's consultation paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stock Exchange's plan to suspend trading in individual companies' shares
when there is evidence that price-sensitive information has leaked was
prompted by a flurry of dealing activity four months ago in Portals, the
manufacturer of banknote paper.
On May 10 Portals shares jumped 44p to 679p, when 385,000 shares were
traded. The exchange immediately started to make inquiries, as the price
jump and the volume of shares traded were unusual for this particular
security.
The initial investigation was carried out by the exchange's price and media
monitoring group. The group is a bridge between the supervision department,
responsible for ensuring the exchange's rules are followed, and its
surveillance group, whose role is to detect and investigate criminal trading
in shares.
The group wanted to ascertain whether there had been a leak of confidential
price-sensitive information concerning Portals to investors. The company had
received a takeover approach - from De La Rue, the banknote printer - but no
announcement to shareholders had been made.
If some of these purchasers of Portals shares had known of the takeover
talks, they might have been insider trading.
However, most were probably not 'insiders' in the strict legal sense.
More likely is that a group of investors got wind that 'something was up'.
They might for example have noticed that Portals shares had been bought by a
stockbroker known for making well-timed investments.
So although the bulk of these deals were probably not criminal, there was an
unequal distribution in the market of information about Portals' prospects.
Anyone selling Portals shares at this time might have complained that they
only did so because they did not possess the full facts.
It was not until four days after Portals received an approach that it made a
statement, by which time a further 468,000 shares had been traded.
It was another three days before De La Rue was named as a possible bidder,
by which time Portals share price had reached 805p.
The Portals case provided a first taste for Mr Michael Lawrence - who had
joined the exchange as chief executive two months earlier - of official
procedures to ensure price-sensitive information is properly disclosed to
the market.
He was extremely uneasy about the delay between the share price jump and
Portals' public statement.
He initiated a review of exchange practices, which resulted in the
publication yesterday of the consultation document on dealings ahead of the
disclosure of price sensitive information.
If the new system had been in place last May the chain of events would have
been very different. As soon as Portals' share-price movement had breached a
set of parameters - fixed on the basis of the normal volatility of its share
price and that of other share prices in its sector - a warning would have
been transmitted to the market on the exchange's Seaq trading screen.
Investors would have been alerted to an exchange probe into a possible leak
of price-sensitive information - and that they should take care before
buying or selling.
Under one of the proposals made yesterday there would also have been a
simultaneous lifting of the obligation on market makers, the wholesaler of
shares, to deal at the prices they quote on the Seaq screen.
Had the monitoring group discovered quickly that there was an innocent
explanation for the price movement, the alert would have been lifted.
In this case, however, the exchange would have been told either by Portals
or the takeover panel, the City body which acts as the referee of bids, that
an approach had been made.
Portals would have been asked to make an immediate public statement. If it
was unable to do so the exchange would have called a halt for 24 hours to
trading in its shares, by which time Portals should have been able to make
an announcement. Failing that, a further period of suspension would have
been insisted on.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Steelmaker plans sharp price rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UES Steels is increasing the price of its engineering steels by between 7
per cent and 12 per cent from January 1, and warning of probable further
increases next year.
The company, based at Stocksbridge near Sheffield, is Europe's leading
manufacturer of engineering steels used by the automotive, energy, power
generation, aerospace and general engineering markets.
Its announcement comes 10 days after British Steel said it was raising the
list prices of its strip products by between 7 per cent and 10 per cent from
January 1.
UES Steels said carbon and alloy prices were set to rise at least 10 per
cent, with minimum increases of 12 per cent for spring steels. Stainless
prices would rise at least 7 per cent.
Mr Martin Howell, commercial director, said: 'We anticipate that there will
be further increases in the course of 1995. It is vital that the steel
industry as a whole achieves the price increases it is seeking in order for
the efficient European producers to retun to profitability.'
Along with British Steel, UES Steels is trying to take advantage of the
recent increased demand for steel.
UES Steels was squeezed badly last year between falling prices for its steel
and rising costs of the scrap it uses as a raw material.
This contributed to a record Pounds 48.1m pre-tax loss last year for its
parent company, UES Holdings, which has since returned to the black.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Record growth in mobile phones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's two biggest cellular phone companies yesterday reported record
subscriber growth for the summer months, continuing the strong upward trend
in mobile phone usage which started last December.
The two companies attracted 256,000 net new subscribers for the third
quarter to September, more than twice the number for the same period last
year. The number of mobile phone users stands at about 2.8m, including
subscribers to the two newer networks, Mercury One-2-One and Orange.
With more than five mobile phone subscribers per 100 people, the UK has
bigger cellular usage per head than any European country outside
Scandinavia. Sweden has more than 12 subscribers per 100.
Cellnet, a joint venture between British Telecommunications and Securicor,
made the biggest gain for the quarter, with 133,000 net new subscribers
compared with 123,000 for Vodafone, the biggest operator.
Vodafone blamed its fall on problems with fraud, which led to a high
drop-off rate over the quarter as new credit-checking measures were
introduced.
Both operators expect a sharp rise in sales in the approach to Christmas.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Avon rejects transition costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Avon County Council yesterday made a further attempt to avoid abolition
under the local government review, saying that the transitional costs of
reorganisation had been greatly underestimated.
The local government commission has recommended that the county and six
district councils in Avon should be replaced by four unitary authorities. In
June the High Court rejected an application by the county for a judicial
review of the proposals.
An Avon deputation including councillors from all three political parties
and backed by local business groups and trade unions yesterday urged Mr
David Curry, local government minister, to reject the proposals and refer
them back to the commission.
The deputation told Mr Curry that the commission's estimate of Pounds 16m in
transitional costs in Avon made no allowance for redundancy payments. The
district councils estimated the costs at up to Pounds 34m, and the county
council at about Pounds 40m.
Avon council also said that the commission's proposals would not provide the
strategic capacity to tackle the region's economic development, transport
and planning.

FT  05 OCT 94 / TGWU to probe fraud allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Transport and General Workers' Union has launched an inquiry into the
running of its north-west England region after allegations of fraud and
wrongful financial accounting in its Merseyside divisional office.
Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, said yesterday that 'major fraud'
had been discovered and the TGWU was taking action to see that it did not
happen again. He added that the union had decided not to call in the police.
The union's executive has agreed to set up a four-man inquiry to decide what
can be done to prevent a repetition of the alleged abuses.
The decision comes in the wake of a report by Mr Albert Blyghton, the
union's legal secretary, following complaints and allegations made against
TGWU officials on Merseyside. Two of three officials named in the report
have already accepted disciplinary action and the other has resigned.
The TGWU general secretary gave the executive a full report of Mr Blyghton's
findings, which conclude that there is 'clear evidence that a major fraud
has been committed against the union and its members in the Merseyside
divisional office, for at least six years.'
The charges include the alleged misuse of members' strike pay by officials,
irregularities in the running of executive council elections and misuse of
finance during recruitment campaigns.
Members told the inquiry in written statements that they had not received
strike pay from the union when involved in five separate disputes on
Merseyside. Other, unknown, people had signed receipts for the money in
their names. The union's auditors had been unable to confirm where the money
had gone.
Mr Blyghton found 'some evidence of financial irregularities' in the
activities of membership recruitment teams organised from the TGWU's
Merseyside divisional office.
It is also alleged that money was misappropriated in a scheme under which a
company supplying illuminated advertising for taxis paid money to the TGWU
on Merseyside to have its signs carried by the union's taxi-driver
membership in the area.
Under the deal Cab Tops, the company, paid the TGWU 'an agreed sum'. The
union would then deduct union contributions and administration charges and
pass the balance to the cab drivers.
Mr Morris said: 'The management of the finances of this scheme were most
irregular. Money paid to the TGWU by Cab Tops was passed through the
Merseyside account into a private building society account'.
It is alleged that a union official who was sole signatory of that account,
'wrote cheques to himself for sums around Pounds 300 and would draw the
money in cash'.
Mr Blyghton also found alleged evidence of financial irregularities in the
use of the union's education budget. There had been no fraud, but 'it was an
example of deliberate wrongful accounting', the report said.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Car part suppliers warned on Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's motor component makers were warned yesterday that their Japanese
rivals were improving quality and productivity at more than twice the
average rate in the UK.
They were told at a seminar backed by the Department of Trade and Industry
that most British suppliers would never catch up with the Japanese unless
they made 'fundamental changes' to their practices.
The companies have been taking part in a DTI 'learning from Japan'
initiative. Teams of executives have been in Japan studying the work
practices of the Japanese.
As part of the initiative the performances of the Japanese and British
components sectors are being evaluated by Andersen Consulting.
Ms Betty Thayer, the Andersen Consulting partner most closely involved with
the initiative, told suppliers: 'On average, world-class Japanese suppliers
are improving their performance by more than 50 per cent a year compared to
less than 25 per cent on average (for the UK industry).'
The aim of the two-year initiative, started earlier this year and backed by
Rover Group and Inchcape, is to upgrade nearly 10,000 smaller British
components makers. They
form one of the biggest elements in the economy, with turnover estimated at
Pounds 15bn a year, nearly 150,000 employees and exports of Pounds 3bn.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Adams benefits from shadow-boxing: The Sinn Fein chief's
warmer-than-expected welcome in Washington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration this weekend decided to salve Mr Gerry Adams's
pride and salvage his two-week tour of the US with a last-minute upgrade in
the level of its contacts with him.
Until last Friday the Sinn Fein leader had been scheduled to meet the State
Department's director of the office of Northern European affairs, and to
'bump into' Ms Nancy Soderberg, staff director of the White House National
Security Council, at a dinner party hosted by the Washington correspondent
of the Irish Times.
But after Mr Adams balked at this relatively low level of meeting his US
sponsors, led by Mr Edward Kennedy, the Democrat senator, increased the
pressure on the White House to accord Mr Adams a more effusive reception.
While sticking to the letter of its promise to the British government that
there would be no meeting at the White House and no meeting with Mr Bill
Clinton, the president, Mr Al Gore, the vice-president, or Mr Anthony Lake,
the national security adviser, the White House obliged.
Mr Adams's State Department host was upgraded to deputy assistant secretary
Mr John Kornblum. Ms Soderberg and Mr Leon Fuerth, the vice-president's
national security adviser, were added to this formal meeting and Mr Lake
conveyed the decision in a gushing letter that had British officials
snorting with annoyance at its praise for Mr Adams as a 'harbinger of
peace.'
To cap it all, the White House decided that Mr Gore would announce the
ending of a 25-year-old US policy barring official contacts with Sinn Fein
in a telephone call to the home of Mrs Ethel Kennedy, widow of the late Mr
Robert widow of the late Mr Robert Kennedy, where Mr Adams was staying.
A senior administration official said: 'We felt this was a fairly historic
decision, and a decision of that level should come from the vice-president.'
Mr Adams's need for a symbolic victory had been increased by the moderate
success of the early part of his US tour.
Before Monday's phone call the view in Whitehall was that the Sinn Fein
president's visit had been much less successful than feared - certainly in
comparison with his ground-breaking trip to New York in February when he was
front-page news.
Events in Haiti and the OJ Simpson trial did not keep the Sinn Fein
president off the air and front pages in the UK as they did in the US.
But when he did hit the headlines - as in the wake of his veiled threat of a
return of IRA violence and the encounter on BBC TV's Newsnight with Mr
Michael Mates, cast in the role of government emissary - the coverage tended
to be critical.
After his hectoring and argumentative performance in the debate with Mr
Mates the impression started to form in London that this period of intense
media exposure - following a six-year spell when Sinn Fein voices were
banned from the airwaves - had quite simply found Mr Adams out.
There was a feeling that one of the most enduring results of his visit would
be to undermine Sinn Fein's image as a ruthlessly efficient propaganda
machine.
Ironically, Fleet Street's news agenda came to London's assistance in the
wake of Washington's decision to open relations with Sinn Fein. The Labour
party conference and a sensational royal story helped to ensure it was
covered less prominently than might otherwise have been the case.
The final verdict on Mr Adams's success in influencing American public
opinion was expected ultimately to hinge on his performance last night in a
30-minute televised debate with Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist
security spokesman.
Although British officials sought publicly to play down the impact of
Washington's diplomatic upgrades, arguing that Mr Clinton had stuck to his
promise not to allow a White House meeting, private reactions have been much
more caustic.
The upgrades probably say less about US policy towards Sinn Fein, or even
about the political clout of Mr Adams's sponsors, than they do about the
weakness of the Clinton administration in general, and on foreign policy in
particular.
They will do nothing to dispel the view prevailing among the US's allies
that the president remains incapable of making and sticking to a decision.
Nevertheless, they have reinforced suspicions that the US is seeking not
just to support the peace process but to play a role in steering it.
'This administration needs to be careful in its contacts with Northern
Ireland,' warned Dr John Alderdice of the Alliance party, whose visit to
Washington coincided with Mr Adams's. Dr Alderdice was received at a higher
level - by Mr Peter Tarnoff, the State Department's number three official.
US officials deny any intention of interfering. But the White House has
alarmed some in Northern Ireland and in the British government by promising
to continue its dialogue with Sinn Fein through its consulate general in
Belfast and its embassy in Dublin - where yet another member of the Kennedy
clan, Mrs Jean Kennedy Smith, is US ambassador.
There is talk of another high-level Sinn Fein visit in November, and
administration officials have even refused to say that they would continue
to refuse visas to members of the IRA.

FT  05 OCT 94 / IRA beatings may delay peace talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY, DAVID GARDNER and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The continuing use of punishment beatings in republican areas of Belfast -
thought to be the work of the provisional IRA - could delay the start of
talks between London and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing.
A British official yesterday warned: 'All military activity may have
stopped, strictly speaking, but the violence in republican areas is
continuing. We have to consider whether this is terrorism by another name.'
London has promised to start a dialogue on how to admit Sinn Fein to
political talks on Northern Ireland's future within three months of a
permanent end to IRA violence.
The emergence of a possible new obstacle to the peace process coincided
yesterday with mixed signals on the prospects for financial aid for the
province to help smooth the path to a durable settlement.
Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said the European Union should
decide by Christmas on whether to make new aid grants focusing on urban
renewal and infrastructure.
The 'peace grants' would be in addition to EU funds already committed to the
province, he said after he and Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary,
briefed EU foreign ministers on recent developments.
Specific sums were not mentioned yesterday but Mr Spring said he expected
December's summit in Essen of EU leaders to agree a substantial package.
Part of the new money could eventually go towards dismantling the 'peace
walls' separating the two northern communities, senior officials said. But
Mr Hurd made it clear that could only happen 'if people want it to happen'.
The EU has allocated Ecu1.23bn (Pounds 960m) in aid to northern Ireland for
1994-99, and raised its annual contribution to the International Fund for
Ireland from Ecu15m to Ecu20m.
US officials have been trying to lower the level of expectations. A senior
administration official said: 'I don't think any large assistance package of
direct aid is on the cards. We just don't have that kind of budget
flexibility.'
Dr John Alderdice, leader of the non-sectarian Alliance party, also drew
this conclusion from his talks with US officials this week.
The White House is examining less direct forms of aid, such as enhancing the
role of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and accelerating
spending from the International Fund for Ireland - to which the US
contributes.
The continuing violence will be another obstacle for Mr Gerry Adams, the
Sinn Fein president, as he tries to increase pressure on London to start
talks on his return from the US later this week.
A further three beatings came to light this week, taking the total number of
beatings in republican ares to 10 since the IRA ceasefire on August 31. In
the same period last year there was only one punishment beating.
The provisional IRA has not admitted it is responsible for the beatings but
the Royal Ulster Constabulary is convinced that it is.

battle with the Investors Compensation Scheme over millions of pounds paid
by the ICS to home income plan investors.
The ICS, a scheme for clients of authorised investment firms which have
collapsed, said yesterday that it had rescinded an agreement with C &amp; G in
September 1992, under which C &amp; G paid the ICS Pounds 545,000 and the ICS
agreed not to press for more. ICS had the option of rescinding within two
years.
The scheme, which is funded by a levy on authorised investment firms, said
yesterday that it 'now takes the view that the society's original payment is
not sufficient' but has not suggested another figure. It said the way for
legal proceedings against the society was now open, should it decide that
this is the most appropriate course.
The ICS has paid out Pounds 5.5m to 242 investors who took out home income
plans on the advice of Aylesbury Associates, a firm of independent financial
advisers which went into liquidation in 1992. The mortgages were arranged by
C &amp; G.
It is believed that the ICS may have to pay between Pounds 7m and Pounds 10m
in compensation to wronged Aylesbury Associate investors. The bill may be
even higher if the ICS fails in its appeal to the House of Lords against an
Appeal Court decision ordering it to pay enhanced compensation to home
income plan victims.
Trade Indemnity, the trade credit insurance company which insured the ICS's
liabilities from 1990 to 1992, made an additional Pounds 7.5m provision in
its half-year accounts against further claims.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the target of a Pounds 1.8bn takeover bid by Lloyds
bank, said yesterday that it had made the Pounds 545,000 payment  - which
has been returned with interest - to help speed up payments to those
entitled to them.
It said: 'We were the lender, we did not make the investments. If the ICS
feels it has a case which would stand up in court, OK. That's up to them to
prove it.'
Home income plans were widely sold during the housing boom of the late 1980s
to elderly householders who mortgaged their homes to release capital which
they invested in income bonds. These were meant to pay the interest on the
mortgage and provide an income. Some plans used roll-up mortgages, which
added the interest to the total debt.
This type of home income plan has now been banned because of its riskiness.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Housing recovery hopes damped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A significant recovery in the housing market is very unlikely before the
spring, according to the Halifax Building society, which releases its house
price index today.
The Halifax says even a recovery in spring 'will require some upturn in
general consumer confidence which is not helped by speculation about higher
interest rates. The housing market now needs a reasonable period of
stability in interest rates.' Most lenders have increased mortgage rates,
following last month's rise in base rates to 5.75 per cent.
According to the Halifax house prices rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per
cent in September. That small rise contrasts with the 2.9 per cent fall
recorded by the Nationwide Building Society's rival index, released on
Monday.
The two indices have often diverged but neither has shown much sign of a
housing market recovery this year. While the Nationwide reports that house
prices have risen by 1.4 per cent in the 12 months to September, Halifax
records a 0.7 per cent fall in the same period.
Meanwhile, mortgage lending grew slightly in August, according to figures
released by the Bank of England. Gross lending by banks and building
societies was a seasonally adjusted Pounds 4.58bn in August, compared with
Pounds 4.54bn in July.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Farmers attack plan to finance milk scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Farmers' leaders yesterday attacked the Milk Marketing Board for threatening
to deduct millions of pounds from milk producers to finance deregulation of
the market in November.
The board said it had not yet received written loan agreements from its
banks for the Pounds 30m it needed to wind up its operations and establish
Milk Marque, the voluntary producers' co-operative that will succeed it. In
a letter to the 28,000 dairy farmers in England and Wales, it said: 'As a
matter of prudence, in the unlikely event that the financing arrangements do
not come to fruition, then it will be necessary to deduct up to 4p per litre
for October supplies.'
The National Farmers' Union said a levy of this size would raise Pounds 37m,
equivalent to about Pounds 1,000 for an average farmer with 70 cows. Sir
David Naish, NFU president, was seeking urgent clarification from the board
about when the money, if deducted, would be repaid.
He said: 'For the past 18 months the MMB has assured us that financial
arrangements for the scheme of reorganisation were in place. Had we known
this was not the case, we would have insisted that this problem be dealt
with much earlier.'
Many farmers were shocked at the threat, especially those who have chosen to
sell direct to a dairy company, rather than through Milk Marque.
Mr Chris Wood, a Cumbrian producer, said the board's levy would cost him
Pounds 1,600. 'Why should I finance somebody else's business?' he asked.
Mr Andrew Dare, the board's chief executive, blamed the delay in finalising
the bank loans on uncertainty caused by the Dairy Trade Federation's
unsuccessful High Court challenge to deregulation last week.
But he admitted that the loans were needed because the flotation of Dairy
Crest, the board's processing arm, had been postponed.
Mr Dare said he hoped that the loans would be agreed in the next fortnight
and insisted that a levy on farmers was 'very remote'. But he indicated
that, in the event of a levy, the money would not be repaid. 'It's a
financing of the scheme, it's not a loan,' he said.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Parts suppliers warned on Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's motor component makers were warned yesterday that their Japanese
rivals were improving quality and productivity at more than twice the
average rate in the UK.
They were told at a seminar backed by the Department of Trade and Industry
as part of a two-year initiative that most British suppliers would never
catch up with the Japanese unless they made 'fundamental changes' to their
business practices.
The companies have been taking part in a DTI 'learning from Japan'
initiative. Under the scheme teams of senior executives from the components
sector have spent weeks in Japan studying the work practices of suppliers to
the Japanese assembly lines of Nissan, Toyota and Honda.
As part of the DTI initiative the relative performances of the Japanese and
British components sectors are being benchmarked by Andersen Consulting.
Ms Betty Thayer of Andersen Consulting told the suppliers: 'On average,
world-class Japanese suppliers are improving their performance by more than
50 per cent a year compared to less than 25 per cent on average (for the UK
industry).'
Andersen is preparing a second benchmarking report on the two industries.
Two years ago an initial benchmarking exercise comparing Japanese and UK
suppliers, which was undertaken by Andersen, Cardiff Business School and
Cambridge University, found a two-to-one gap in productivity and a
100-to-one gap in quality performance between the suppliers, with only
Unipart matching Japanese suppliers on quality.
Companies taking part in the initiative appear to have been shaken by their
experience of the Japanese.
Mr John Horsler, managing director of Luton-based Cardale Engineering, said:
'It's no good saying we are going to improve quality by 5 per cent a year.
We have got to go for 70 per cent to 80 per cent annual improvements to
achieve our goal in a reasonable time.'
Unipart Industries, an expanding supplier to both Honda and Toyota, stressed
yesterday that the DTI was not scaremongering. Mr John Neill, group chief
executive, said: 'I don't think people in the UK in general have any idea
just how big the gap is between the Japanese and the British. Suppliers
think they're good here - but they've really got to confront the facts.'
The aim of the initiative, which started earlier this year and is backed by
Rover Group and Inchcape, is to upgrade the quality of nearly 10,000 smaller
British manufacturers of components.
Component makers form one of the biggest elements in the manufacturing
economy, with turnover estimated at Pounds 15bn a year, nearly 150,000
employees and exports of Pounds 3bn.

FT  05 OCT 94 / BR's condom-flag advert is labelled 'irresponsible'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A British Rail advertisement featuring 12 yellow condoms arranged in a
circle against a blue background was criticised yesterday by the Advertising
Standards Authority for being 'grossly irresponsible in its encouragement of
promiscuity', and for denigrating the flag of the European Union.
The newspaper advertisement, intended to boost sales of the Young Person's
European rail pass, was headed 'Inter-Rail. You've got the rest of your life
to be good'. It also referred to the European Commission's 'Europe Against
Aids' initiative.
The ASA, the advertising watchdog, received 164 complaints. It ruled that
the advertisement's approach was irresponsible and had caused widespread
offence.
British Rail denied encouraging promiscuity, saying research showed a
significant proportion of 18-to-25-year-olds had sexual encounters without a
condom on holiday, and Inter-Rail supports the European Aids initiative.
BR was asked to avoid similar style advertisements.
The ASA rejected complaints about a British Telecommunications advertisement
which was headed 'Do you ever wish your kids would use the phone more?' The
ASA ruled that the advertisement was 'a legitimate attempt by the
advertisers to encourage greater use of their product'.

Mr David Curry, the environment minister, yesterday unveiled a programme
aimed at attracting Pounds 100m in private-sector funds for property
development in new towns.
The 'Invest In Success' scheme provides land in new towns at discounted
prices to partnerships between district councils and the private sector. All
are required to use the land for leisure or cultural facilities,
environmental improvements, social uses or low cost housing.
Funding will now go to 15 projects which have been chosen from 34 initial
applicants.
The winning projects are in Peterborough, Welwyn Hatfield in Hertfordshire,
Sunderland, South Ribble and Chorley in Lancashire, Warrington and Runcorn
in Cheshire, Redditch and Telford.

FT  05 OCT 94 / TSB aims to close up to 200 branches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB, the banking and insur-ance group, is to close up to 200 branches next
year out of a network of 1,200.
The bank, which closed 100 branches this year, said the decision was in line
with its strategy of offering services through larger branches, cash
dispenser machines and a telephone banking service launched on Monday.
The bank is to carry out next year's closures by way of mergers, which will
be decided on the basis of location and potential for future business.
Customers' accounts will be automatically transferred to the branch with
which the old one is being merged.
The bank, which made pre-tax profits of Pounds 301m last year, said that
there would be no redundancies among permanent clerical staff as a result of
the closures, but 30 junior managers might lose their jobs.
However, Mr Rob MacGregor, assistant secretary of the Bifu banking union,
said: 'We view any announcement on such a radical branch closure programme
resulting in 30 redundancies with some scepticism. Where are all those staff
who work in those branches going to go if some are not to be made redundant?
'TSB goes through one reorganisation after another. There have been half a
dozen in the last 10 years and this is going to demoralise the workforce.'
There were 1,000 redundancies at TSB in the year to October 31 1993 and it
is expected that the figure for this year will be similar.
The bank is in dispute with staff over an imposed 2 per cent pay rise and
plans for performance-related pay. Bifu has called for a 6 per cent pay
increase but industrial action has been averted pending talks with
management at Acas, the conciliation service, today.
Last night Mr MacGregor questioned the timing of TSB's closures
announcement, suggesting that it might have been timed to undermine
employees' resolve for industrial action. Union members voted by a slender
majority for a mandate to take selective strike action.
The issue of branch closures resulted in staff going on strike in January
last year.
In June TSB said it would shed about 150 senior managers as part of a
restructuring of its branch network because it was consolidating three
regions into a single national structure.

<TEXT>
Talks between the RMT transport union and London Underground aimed at
averting a Tube strike were abandoned last night without agreement and with
no plans to reconvene, Richard Donkin writes.
The union had already given notice of plans to hold a 24-hour strike among
its 8,000 London Underground members starting tomorrow at 7.30pm.
The RMT members who work as station staff, signallers and train drivers have
rejected a 2.5 per cent pay offer which London Underground says is final.
The company is expected to run more than half the normal number of trains if
the strike goes ahead. The other five unions whose members work on the
Underground have accepted the 2.5 per cent offer.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Clarke holds out hope of tax cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday held out the prospect of tax
cuts but insisted that they would only come when the economy and public
finances were in good health.
In his speech to the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank, Mr Clarke repeated that talk of tax cuts in November's budget
'is hopelessly premature'.
But he added: 'As the economy strengthens further and public expenditure is
brought firmly under control, tax cuts can come back on to the agenda.'
Mr Clarke warned, however, that the stock of debt in the UK was already far
too high. 'I have no intention of adding to that stock by more than I have
to. Therefore, tax cuts can only take place and will only take place in the
context of healthy recovery and healthy public finances.'
The chancellor stressed that it was 'a matter of judgment' to decide when
tax cuts would help to sustain economic growth rather than impair it.
Mr Clarke admitted to journalists that he was already thinking ahead to his
speech to next week's Tory party conference.
Taking a swipe at the Labour party, he told a press conference that his
speech was to show Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, that there were
economic policies that lay 'between post-classical economic theory on the
one hand and meaningless empty ramblings on the other'.
In a move to deter speculation that the PSBR is falling faster than
forecast, he revised the written version of the IMF speech that was released
in Madrid and London. Whereas the text spoke of a budget deficit 'set to
exceed Pounds 30bn this year' Mr Clarke said the figure should be Pounds
36bn, and so in line with the Treasury's forecast.

FT  05 OCT 94 / The Gooda Walker Judgment: Judge deplores underwriters'
failure to assess full extent of risk - The ruling which found that the
three underwriters failed their Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The central issue before the High Court in the Gooda Walker case was whether
the underwriters had been negligent in leaving their syndicates so heavily
exposed to the series of catastrophes such as the Piper Alpha disaster that
occurred in the 1980s.
At the start of the case the Names argued that the Gooda Walker underwriters
were negligent in leaving the syndicates so exposed. They said that the
underwriters had failed to manage their businesses adequately by not
properly monitoring their total exposure to risk, had failed to arrange
sufficient reinsurance and had exercised insufficient care in dealings with
the excess of loss 'spiral'.
The Gooda Walker agents responded by arguing that the sequence of
catastrophes was unprecedented and unforeseeable. They also argued that
underwriting excess of loss cover - known as LMX - was an intrinsically
high-risk business, that there was no obligation to reinsure all risks and
that Lloyd's regulations did not oblige underwriters to calculate their
total exposure, or 'probable maximum losses'.
The three Gooda Walker underwriters whose actions were under scrutiny were
Mr Derek Walker, Mr Stanley Andrews and Mr Anthony Willard.
Mr Justice Phillips ruled that all three had failed to exercise the skill
and care to be expected of competent underwriters.
'The growth of the LMX market in the 1980s and, in particular, the growth of
the spiral business, raised special problems in relation to the assessment
of risk, exposure and rating that called for special consideration. Some
gave that consideration. The Gooda Walker underwriters did not.'
The judge continued later: 'The exposure in respect of which I have held the
underwriters at fault was culpable because it was unintended, unplanned and
unjustified by any proper analysis of risk.'
Their principle negligence was in failing to buy sufficient reinsurance
protection, he ruled.
The issues in the case fell into two main areas - the nature of competent
underwriting practice in the Lloyd's market generally and how responsible
underwriters should have approached excess of loss cover on existing excess
of loss cover - the 'spiral'.
Competent underwriting
Mr Justice Phillips ruled that there are basic principles of insurance
underwriting which should be adhered to:
An underwriting account should be balanced in that all the risk should not
be exposed to the same loss. He also rejected the agents' argument that
Names should accept that, having agreed to unlimited liability, their
underwriters could then deliberately expose them to such a risk.
'On the contrary, the Name will reasonably expect the underwriter to
exercise due skill and care to prevent him suffering losses,' he said.
If an underwriter intended to expose Names to periodic losses he must make
sure that they were aware of this and the scale of the potential losses, he
said.
Accounts should be planned so an underwriter knows what he is doing, the
judge said. This includes monitoring the total liabilities and probable
maximum losses to which accounts are exposed.
'In my judgment, it was a fundamental principle of excess of loss
underwriting that the underwriter should formulate and follow a plan as to
the amount of exposure that his syndicate would run,' he said.
Reinsurance policy. The judge ruled that an underwriter must know the
exposure he intends to run and ensure that this is not exceeded. This should
be done by having a proper reinsurance policy.
Mr Justice Phillips rejected the agents' argument that LMX business was
widely known to be high-risk. 'It is quite plain from the evidence before me
that this was not the perception of LMX business shared by many of the
defendants at the time.
'I have no doubt that there are many plaintiffs who would understandably
have felt outraged had they heard the plea being advanced on behalf of their
members agents that Names had no cause for complaint because the type of
business they had chosen to write was well-known to be dynamite.'
The spiral
Mr Justice Phillips described the spiral - the complex arrangement under
which catastrophe excess of loss risks were insured and reinsured, often
many times - as 'rather like a multiple game of pass the parcel'. Those left
holding the liability were those who first exhausted their layers of LMX
reinsurance. The effect on individual syndicates was to magnify many times
the impact of a particular loss, he said.
The judge quoted the views on the spiral of Mr Richard Outhwaite, the
underwriter who gave expert evidence for the agents, and his reluctance to
write spiral business because of the exposure involved.
'In my judgment the Gooda Walker underwriters should have shared the
appreciation of the spiral enjoyed . . . by Mr Outhwaite. No reason has been
suggested by the defendants why the Gooda Walker underwriters should not
have made the same appraisal of spiral business as Mr Outhwaite, and I can
think of none.'
His dismissed the agents' argument that the Gooda Walker underwriters should
be judged according to the standards of competence of other participants in
the spiral.
'Suppose a profession collectively adopts extremely lax standards in some
aspect of its work. The court does not regard itself as bound by those
standards and will not acquit practitioners of negligence simply because
they complied with those standards.'
Syndicates 290 and 164
Mr Justice Phillips ruled that Mr Derek Walker, the underwriter,
deliberately ran exposures to risk without monitoring those exposures
properly or informing Names of this. He made no attempt to estimate how
often his Names might lose and failed to appreciate the level of catastrophe
that risked such losses. His conduct amounted to a breach of the duty to
exercise reasonable skill and care, the judge ruled. Syndicate 298
Mr Justice Phillips ruled that the performance of Mr Stanley Andrews, the
underwriter for syndicate 298, fell 'far short of reasonable competence'.
The judge said he could not believe Mr Andrews' evidence that he monitored
his aggregate exposures, and his approach to buying reinsurance was unclear.
Mr Andrews had said he believed the loss of Piper Alpha was 'unthinkable'.
The judge ruled that his failure to properly assess cover for such a loss
was negligent.
Syndicate 299
Mr Justice Phillips ruled that Mr Anthony Willard, the underwriter for
syndicate 299, did not mean to expose Names to big losses. However, he did
not calculate probable maximum losses and so they formed no part of his
reinsurance policy which proved unsound.
Damages
Having ruled in favour of the Names, Mr Justice Phillips finally had to rule
ruled on the principles by which they should be awarded compensation. He
rejected the Names' claim that they should be compensated for all the losses
they suffered through their involvement with the Gooda Walker syndicates.
Instead, damages should be based on the losses sustained from the negligent
conduct in failing to arrange sufficient reinsurance, he ruled.
He said: 'The plaintiffs are entitled to that award of damages which will
place them in the same position as if the underwriting carried out on their
behalf by each syndicate had been competently performed.'

FT  05 OCT 94 / The Gooda Walker Judgment: Jubilant Names hail 'justice and
salvation'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Mr Michael Deeny, the chairman of the Gooda Walker Action group,
yesterday's High Court verdict was a triumph of justice that 'represents
salvation' for many distressed Lloyd's Names.
For Mr Derek Ritchie, who stood to lose 'in excess of half a million pounds'
on Gooda Walker syndicates, yesterday's judgment was, less grandiloquently,
an 'enormous relief'.
Mr Ritchie of West Sussex, who is semi-retired but still works as a
chartered surveyor, professed himself 'absolutely delighted'. He was
introduced to the world of the Lloyd's insurance market while playing golf
in 1973.
He is aware that many substantial points remain to be sorted out between
plaintiffs and defendants before any compensation payments are made, but the
verdict gave him hope that he might be able to avoid having to sell his
home. 'There is a light at the end of the tunnel,' he said.
Mr Ritchie said he would wait for a detailed appraisal of the 146-page
judgment before making any decisions about his future.
Other Names were similarly cautious about assuming that the action group
would ever actually reclaim the Pounds 504m to which it estimates it is
entitled. Mr Richard Platts, who owes Lloyd's a total of Pounds 800,000,
with most of his debts incurred on Gooda Walker syndicates, said: 'It's an
excellent victory - but it is the first step in the proceedings.'
Mr Platts, 60, was a university academic teaching economics before taking
early retirement in 1988. 'I taught economics but it does not have anything
to do with insurance.'
His link with the international insurance market was through friends and
family - his grandfather and two uncles were Lloyd's Names. 'All my capital
has gone. I am living in Chorleywood, Hertfordshire, but I don't own a
property.
'These are not like any other bills in life. You can't just pull out a
cheque book. Imagine getting a polite little letter asking for Pounds
800,000. I just have a file for unpaid Lloyd's bills . . . You just have to
get on with life - compartmentalise it. I don't know if I will ever wipe the
slate clean. This is a start.'
Mr Basil Payne, a Gooda Walker Name, was an insurance broker at Lloyd's for
40 years.
He said that while the judgment was 'as good as I could have hoped for . . .
in effect my working life will have been for nothing.'
Mr Payne, who lives in Tunbridge Wells, said he had watched the news at noon
on the television: 'I jumped about when I heard,' he said.
He said that in spite of working at Lloyd's he felt that the institution was
'an absolute disgrace' and that those who were to blame for the situation
would escape personal loss.
Mr Paul Powis was a chartered accountant who worked with the insurance
market before investigating the risks and becoming a Name himself. He now
owes Pounds 40,000 on Gooda Walker business and Pounds 600,000 in total to
Lloyd's.
He was having a cup of coffee at home in rural Kent with his wife when he
heard the news. 'I had been given a pretty good indication a few days
earlier but I was elated. I am enormously pleased,' he said.
The Gooda Walker court case has set new records for being both the biggest
civil action ever brought before an English court and for winning the
largest amount in damages.
The award, estimated by the Names at Pounds 504m, is expected to far exceed
the Pounds 172m paid last year by merchant bankers Samuel Montagu to the
liquidators of British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings.

FT  05 OCT 94 / The Gooda Walker Judgment: Compensation for members
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The compensation that the Gooda Walker Action Group eventually succeeds in
obtaining will be pooled and divided according to the losses incurred by
individual members.
Some Gooda Walker Names have lost up to Pounds 1m, so they could, in theory,
receive as much as Pounds 800,000 - although that assumes that the group
defies expectations and secures at least the Pounds 500m it reckons it is
owed, about 80 per cent of its initial claim of Pounds 629m.
Mr Michael Deeny, action group chairman, said the group rejected the idea
that payments to individual members should vary according to which
syndicates their money was invested in - some of which have better errors
and omissions insurance cover out of which damages will be paid.
The losers are likely to be the estimated 900 Gooda Walker Names who did not
join the action group's legal challenge and will not be entitled to the
compensation awarded by the High Court.

FT  05 OCT 94 / The Gooda Walker Judgment: ASA uphold Lloyd's complaint
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Advertising Standards Authority, the advertising watchdog, yesterday
upheld a complaint by Lloyd's that a group of names had placed 'inaccurate,
grossly misleading and offensive' advertisements in the press.
The regional press advertisements, from the Wellington Names Association,
were headlined 'How many more people have to die before Lloyd's is brought
to account?' A subheading read: 'At least 31 suicides and premature deaths
have been attributed to the losses sustained by Lloyd's Names.'
The ASA said it was concerned with the lack of substantiation for all of the
31 deaths, and asked the advertisers not to refer to them again.

FT  05 OCT 94 / The Gooda Walker Judgment: Spiral that got out of control
finally unwound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The end of one of the most spectacular boom and bust episodes seen at the
Lloyd's insurance market is in sight following yesterday's court victory by
Gooda Walker Names.
The Names were among about 4,000 whose assets supported syndicates managed
by the Gooda Walker agency between 1987 and 1990. Many were among the least
wealthy ever sucked into Lloyd's. Yet their overall losses amount to more
than Pounds 1bn, more than 13 per cent of the losses suffered by Lloyd's
since 1988.
Gooda Walker's managing agency administered a range of syndicates, which
originally specialised in aviation and marine business.
During the 1980s they expanded into a specialist area of reinsurance - the
'spiral'. Its underwriters covered high-level risks underwritten by other
syndicates and companies. Its members' agency earned fees by placing Names
on Gooda's own and other syndicates.
Gooda's syndicates earned respectable profits during the mid-1980s when
there were relatively few catastrophe losses. In 1986 one of its biggest
syndicates ranked seventh out of 102 non-marine syndicates.
While syndicates in other sectors of the market grew relatively slowly in an
increasingly competitive international marketplace Gooda expanded its
reinsurance activities. Names, many new to Lloyd's, flooded onto the
syndicates and Gooda's capacity - its ability to accept premiums - increased
sharply, from Pounds 47.9m in 1983 to Pounds 270.4m in 1988.
Names on syndicate 290 jumped from 713 in 1983 to 3,163 in 1989. Many
newcomers came directly from Gooda's own members' agency.
As other syndicates and companies were attracted to booming 'spiral'
business, rates charged by underwriters fell. With premium income
inadequate, the syndicates were vulnerable to a string of large catastrophe
losses, triggered by 1987's storms.
Gooda's syndicates were overwhelmed by losses from the Piper Alpha explosion
in July 1988, Hurricane Hugo in September 1989 and the European storms of
January 1990.
The businesses limped on through 1990 and part of 1991 but were eventually
forced into liquidation. All its syndicates ceased to trade and the affairs
of its Names were transferred to other agencies. In June 1992 it emerged
that Mr Tony Gooda, formerly chairman of the members' agency, and himself a
Name, had applied to the Lloyd's hardship committee for help to meet his
losses.
In late 1992 a Lloyd's internal review found that management deficiencies
and poor underwriting were at the heart of the syndicates' difficulties.

FT  05 OCT 94 / The Gooda Walker Judgment: Group led by cool chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Gooda Walker agency did itself no favours when it recruited Mr Michael
Deeny, a 49-year-old Irishman and chairman of the victorious Gooda Walker
Names Action Group, to become a member of its flagship syndicate - 290 - in
1985.
Mr Deeny, a chartered accountant, has proved an able and proficient
political leader, successfully co-ordinating the biggest campaign for
compensation ever fought by Lloyd's Names.
He is now a music promoter organising concerts for the likes of U2, Bruce
Springsteen and Nirvana and Luciano Pavarotti, but trained as an accountant
after graduating in history from Magdalene College, Oxford. Recruited to
Lloyd's by an agent who had links with a number of Irish QCs, Mr Deeny says
he considered Lloyd's to be a conservative investment. 'I thought if they
think it is OK it will be OK. It seemed to be an established institution
which had been sending Names cheques for 300 years,' he explained.
However, unlike many fellow Gooda Names, Mr Deeny took an active involvement
at the market, interviewing underwriters and checking accounts. He has an
informed view of accounting policies at Lloyd's, criticising those of the
one Gooda Walker syndicate of which he was a member, the group's flagship
syndicate 290, as 'highly misleading', mainly because of the way purchases
of financial reinsurance - a policy which allows syndicates to manage their
reserves more effectively - were treated.
After losing money Mr Deeny became active in the group's campaign and took
over as chairman following a row over a plan to remunerate committee members
late in 1992.
As chairman of the action group, Mr Deeny has taken a cool and calculated
approach, avoiding the loose allegations and emotionalism favoured by some
of his fellow leaders. The group's action was tightly focused and well
organised.
Yesterday Mr Deeny was typically phlegmatic. 'The photographers are hassling
me to crack open champagne but I really don't feel like it,' he said. 'This
thing has wrecked people's lives. It has been pretty horrific.'

FT  05 OCT 94 / The Gooda Walker Judgment: Award unlikely to prompt flood of
new actions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lossmaking Names have won an apparently emphatic victory against the
professional members agencies' who advised them and placed them on the
ill-fated Gooda Walker syndicates. But the impact on the insurance market as
a whole is likely to be limited.
The verdict will encourage other aggrieved members, particularly those whose
syndicates specialised in the kind of reinsurance business favoured by the
Gooda agency. It is unlikely to open the floodgates for further actions,
however.
Most of the more than two dozen cases filed stem from the more than Pounds
7bn of losses suffered by Lloyd's between 1988 and 1991, and with it now
apparently trading profitably - profits of up to Pounds 1bn for the 1993
underwriting year are expected - active Names have relatively few
grievances.
Nor does the award provide unqualified encouragement for every other legal
action involving past losses by Names. This is for a number of reasons.
By grabbing a sizeable share of the insurance funds available for
compensation payments, the Gooda Names may well have left other action
groups pursuing legal battles with the prospect of rapidly diminishing
returns.
Most of the money to fund the award will come from errors and omissions
insurance policies which cover agents' legal claims for negligence. The
funds available under such policies are thought to be limited to between
Pounds 820m and Pounds 1.08bn, compared with overall claims of about Pounds
3bn. Beyond those limits claims will fall on the members' agents themselves.
But most of these agencies are small and many are no longer trading.
Success for Gooda Walker cases does not necessarily mean others will
succeed. The verdict undoubtedly represents a fillip for the next case -
that mounted by Names on the Feltrim syndicates. Mr Justice Phillips'
criticism yesterday of the so-called excess-loss spiral - in which
syndicates and companies covered each others' high-level catastrophe risks -
are a helpful precedent. Other Names from spiral syndicates such as Rose
Thomson Young, Devonshire and Bromley will also be encouraged.
However a Lloyd's panel, chaired by Sir Michael Kerr, the former High Court
judge, examined the relative strengths of 31 separate claims earlier this
year as part of an out-of-court settlement offer.
Although the panel found the cases of the Gooda and Feltrim Names were
'strong' it said that the legal ground for many of the smaller actions, some
of which are linked to US asbestosis and pollution losses, were 'weak' or
even 'hopeless'. Its view on another big liability-related loss that
suffered by Names on Merrett syndicate 418/417, was mixed, with some claims
viewed as having strong prospects. Merrett Names expect their case to come
to court early next year.
Even for the Gooda Walker Action Group members yesterday's victory could
prove far from clear-cut.
As well as the possibility of an appeal the most obvious caveat is that
damages have yet to be agreed - lawyers acting for the members' agencies who
lost yesterday described the Pounds 504m figure as 'speculative'.
Yet agreement on damages is only the first stage. The Gooda Walker Action
Group will also have to fight hard if the errors and omissions insurers are
to fund any settlement fully. The errors and omissions cover available to
the agencies sued by the Gooda Walker agencies may prove insufficient. The
action group admits, for instance, that the cover on the discredited Gooda
Walker members' agency has been declared void.
The group also faces legal hurdles in its attempts to sue Littlejohn Frazer,
the former Gooda Walker auditors. It hopes to recoup the difference between
its Pounds 629m total compensation claim and the sum eventually agreed with
the agencies.
Meanwhile the impact on Lloyd's and its broader business is likely to be
limited. Most of the errors and omissions policies have been underwritten by
Lloyd's syndicates, but it is understood that reserves to pay the losses
incurred as a result of the award have already been set aside.
Although the award and its attendant publicity could tarnish its image,
Lloyd's will point out that the market has changed radically since the late
1980s when the losses were incurred. The management of the Lloyd's
corporation, which administers the market, has been overhauled since Mr
Peter Middleton took over as chief executive in 1992.
The marketplace - one populated by hundreds of tiny syndicates, brokers and
agencies - has become less fragmented and more efficient. More than half the
401 syndicates which traded in 1990 have been forced out of business by
their losses.
Above all Lloyd's has succeeded - against some expectations - in attracting
investment from institutions and bigger agencies. Syndicates believe their
future depends on links with these corporate investors. Last year about
Pounds 800m in corporate money was attracted. This year investors are
expected to commit a further Pounds 125m to Pounds 250m. By tightening links
with corporate investors through dedicated investment funds, some agencies
are explicitly paving the way for their transformation into insurance
companies.
Against this background legal action, even if successful, is likely to be an
irritant rather than a serious threat to the health of the market.

FT  05 OCT 94 / China and US settle missiles dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and China yesterday settled a year-old dispute over Chinese exports
of missile technology to Pakistan.
In a deal signed in Washington yesterday, the US agreed to lift trade
sanctions it imposed last year to punish China for the missile technology
exports. In exchange, China promised to stop all exports of missiles that
can carry a payload of more than 500kg further than 300km.
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said the deal was a
'global and verifiable ban' on all Chinese exports of missiles classified as
Category One under the Missile Technology Control Regime, which sets the
500kg and 300km limits.
The US originally imposed sanctions on China a year ago after complaining
that China had violated the MTCR by selling Pakistan technology for M-11
missiles. China has always insisted that it did not violate the MTCR, and Mr
Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister, repeated that position yesterday.
'China does not engage in proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
including missiles outside the MTCR regime,' he said.
Some of the discussion hinged on whether the M-11, whose official range is
slightly less than 300km, was covered by the MTCR. US officials said its
capability placed it within MTCR guidelines, and see the missile as a
proliferation threat because of its potential to carry nuclear warheads.
The US sanctions prohibited the granting of export licences to sell China
advanced electronics, space and aircraft systems worth an estimated Dollars
400m-Dollars 500m a year.
Relations between China and the US have improved since President Bill
Clinton in May abandoned efforts to link China's trading privileges to human
rights.

European foreign ministers yesterday showed their determination to meet the
deadline set for ratification of the Uruguay Round by agreeing to send paper
work to the European parliament in time for consultation ahead of January 1
1995, writes Emma Tucker in Brussels.
This will allow ratification to progress while the Europen Commission and
member states await the opinion of the European Court of Justice on who has
the authority to negotiate in contested trade areas. The court verdict is
expected on November 15.
By bringing forward the date to mid-November, the court has helped to defuse
a row between member states and the Commission over the legal basis for
ratification.
The Commission asked the court for advice after member states argued that it
did not have the authority to negotiate in areas such as services and
intellectual property rights where no EU legislation yet exists.

The Japanese government is expected soon to submit legislation to implement
the Uruguay Round trade treaty to an extraordinary session of the Diet,
paving the way for ratification of the trade agreements by the beginning of
next year.
Having just manoeuvred through one round of contentious trade talks with the
US, Japanese officials are relieved that their task of implementing the
Uruguay Round agreements has not been as difficult as in either the US or
the EU.
Japan made substantial offers in the Uruguay Round negotiations to reduce
tariffs by a weighted average of 61 per cent on industrial and mining goods
and, more controversially, to open up the country's long-protected rice
market to imports from 1995.
Tariffs on eight sectors from pharmaceuticals and construction equipment to
distilled spirits are set to be eliminated, while import restrictions will
be lifted on agricultural products ranging from silk-worm cocoons to dairy
products.
After years of jealously guarding its inefficient rice market, the
government also agreed to allow imports from 1995. But in spite of the
initial hullabaloo over opening the country's rice market, government
officials are confident that the revision of domestic laws necessary to
implement the Uruguay Round accord will pass the Diet without incident.
'Things are proceeding as scheduled,' confirmed an official at the Ministry
of Trade and Industry, which has authority over many of the industrial
sectors which will be affected by the new legislation.
Even Zenchu, the Central Union of Agricultural Co-operatives, which has been
vociferous in its opposition to opening the country's rice market, is
resigned to the prospect of liberalisation.
'We are against the contents of the Uruguay Round agreement, but we are not
planning to stand in the way of ratification,' says one Zenchu official.
'Ratification will aggravate the critical situation facing Japanese farmers
but we expect the government to keep to its promise to ensure that farmers
do not suffer as a result of the agreement.'
As in other issues, the Japanese aversion to discord and fear of appearing
to be out of line is apparently helping rally support for passage of Uruguay
Round legislation. The bills, which cover 15 areas, are expected to be
presented to the Diet as a package to facilitate passage, and nobody, not
even angry farmers, wants to be blamed for preventing Japan from living up
to its international commitment.
The government agreed to liberalise many markets and 'the agricultural
sector alone cannot expect to receive special treatment,' the Zenchu
official said.
Although some diehard politicians from farming communities may still find
liberalisation of the rice market hard to swallow, the standard line from
the leading political parties is that this step cannot be avoided.
The opposition includes many members of the then ruling coalition which was
responsible for endorsing the Uruguay Round agreement in the first place.
There is, however, one possible hitch. While there is general agreement that
liberalisation of the rice market is inevitable, discord over the revision
of Japan's Staple Food Control Act could become an obstacle to smooth
passage of the entire Uruguay Round legislature package.
In order to live up to its Gatt promise on rice, Japan will have to revise
parts of the Food Control Act.
Recent changes in the rice market, meanwhile, have triggered a long-needed
move to revamp this 1942 law aimed at keeping the rice market under
government control, which has created severe anomalies in the market.
A full revision of the Food Control Act is far more controversial than the
limited steps that are required to fulfil Japan's Gatt obligations.
Inability to reach agreement on the first issue could in turn, stymie the
government's Uruguay Round effort.
'If that happens,' says an official at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry
and Fisheries, 'it might become difficult to implement necessary legislation
before January 1. That is a major concern for the ministry.'
So far, such dangers are limited. An advisory committee to the prime
minister has already pronounced on the need to reform the Food Control Act.
The three parties in the ruling coalition have been locked in lengthy
discussions on the issue and even went through an all-night session late
last month to co-ordinate their views.
Japan needs to open its telecommunications market to international
competition and remove the barrier between domestic and international
businesses if it is to meet the changing telecommunications needs of users,
Sir Iain Vallance, chairman of BT, said in Tokyo yesterday, writes Michiyo
Nakamoto.
As a result of tight regulation of its telecoms market, it was a struggle
for international telecommunications operators such as BT to provide
end-to-end services for customers in the region.
The British telecommunications company has been seeking to provide voice
telephony to corporate customers in Japan but has been hindered by
regulations, Sir Iain said. At the same time, NTT, the Japanese domestic
telecoms operator, is not allowed to provide international services,
preventing a direct link-up with BT. Instead, BT had linked up with an NTT
subsidiary to provide global communications services. The high degree of
regulation was also denying Japanese users the full benefits of new services
and competitive pricing, Sir Iain warned.
The Japanese government may decide next year whether to break up NTT and
encourage competition.

Mitsubishi Motors, the Japanese vehicle maker, is considering expanding
production at a plant it is building in the Netherlands as a joint venture
with Volvo of Sweden.
This follows a decision by the European Commission to allow more Japanese
vehicle exports to the EU.
Mitsubishi Motors and Volvo will begin production of smallcars at
Netherlands Car next year, to reach an annual capacity of 200,000 by 1997,
Mitsubishi said.
In the past year, the company has seen a decline of about 10 per cent in
exports to Europe, which it blames in part on the sluggishness of the market
and the strong yen. It aims eventually to make locally up to half the cars
it sells in Europe. Michiyo Nakamoto, Tokyo.
Fiat Auto plans to produce a small car similar to the Uno in Brazil for
South American markets. Fiat will invest L1,000bn (Dollars 642.7m), mostly
at its Bel Horizonte plant, to produce 1,000 units a day or 250,000 a year
by 1996. AFX, Paris
FLS Industries of Denmark, the leading global supplier of cement mills and
machinery, said its US unit, Fuller, had won an order worth about Kr400m
(Dollars 67m)to supply a 7,500 tonne-a-day production line to the Indian
company Sanghi Industries. AFX, Copenhagen
Lucas Industries has won a second car contract for its EPIC electronic
diesel fuelling system. The contract, with French car group, PSA, the
largest car manufacturer in Europe, follows EPIC's debut on the Mercedes
C22OD last year. It will be fitted to Peugeots and Citroens. Extel, London

FT  05 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Gatt panel to rule on US-Venezuela dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The governing council of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
yesterday agreed to set up a disputes panel to rule on a Venezuelan
complaint that US rules for reformulated gasoline discriminate against
imports.
In a meeting dominated by trade issues involving the US, Washington bowed to
a separate panel ruling against local-content requirements for tobacco used
in US-made cigarettes. However, it continued to resist pressure by other
nations for adoption of a controversial panel judgment against its embargo
on imported tuna.
Venezuela's complaint relates to rules on certification of imported gasoline
which it claims use a less favourable methodology than that used to certify
domestically refined gasoline. Venezuela also claims that under the rules
some exporting countries receive preferential treatment, breaching Gatt's
non-discrimination rule.
Mr Alberto Poletto, Venezuelan trade minister, said yesterday that the new
certification rules, adopted last December by the US Environmental
Protection Agency, could reduce the value of his country's exports to the US
of Dollars 478m last year by at least Dollars 150m. The rules would also
reduce the return on a Dollars 1bn-plus investment programme Venezuela has
launched to upgrade its refineries.
At the same meeting, the Gatt council adopted a disputes panel report which
found against a US law requiring US-made cigarettes to contain at least 75
per cent US-grown tobacco. The US said yesterday it would accept the ruling,
and measures to implement it have been attached to the legislation for the
Uruguay Round trade accords.
Washington continues to resist adoption of a panel report which says the US
is violating Gatt rules by imposing an embargo on tuna from countries whose
tuna fishing nets kill too many dolphins. Yesterday, in spite of
overwhelming support for adoption among trading partners, Mr Booth Gardner,
US ambassador to Gatt, said only he would report their views to Washington.
Among other items on yesterday's agenda the council:
Took note of a working party report on the European Union's Lome Convention
with African, Caribbean and Pacific nations, which failed to reach consensus
on its Gatt consistency. The US and Canada again called for the EU to seek a
specific waiver for the Convention from Gatt rules;
Agreed to pursue consultations on a US proposal to make most Gatt documents
public.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eight telecom groups, each with a foreign partner, have been awarded
licences to operate cellular telephones in India's main cities from April
next year.
After two years of legal and bureaucratic argument, Mr Sukh Ram,
communications minister, announced the award of licences for Bombay, Delhi,
Madras and Calcutta. He ordered his officials to ensure all formalities were
completed by March 1995, so that services could start in April.
The decision, following the announcement of rules for the entry of private
companies into basic telephone services, indicates that Mr Sukh Ram and his
civil servants are ready to implement market-oriented reforms in an industry
monopolised by the state.
In addition to the licences for the four cities, the government plans to
award licences for a further 18 regions, roughly corresponding to India's
states, in the next few months. Fifteen private groups have also been given
permission to operate radio paging services in 27 cities.
With some reluctance, the ministry has admitted that the government, with
its limited resources, cannot provide the huge investment needed in Indian
telecommunications. In basic services alone, the government is seeking up to
Rs230bn (Dollars 7.3bn) investment from private companies. In cellular
networks, the total could run to Rs50bn.
The most sought-after cellular telephone licences, for Bombay, have been
awarded to Hutchison Max Telecom, a company backed by Hutchison Telecom of
Hong Kong, and to BPL Systems and Projects, a venture supported by France
Telecom, the French carrier.
Contract winners in other cities, with the names of overseas partners in
brackets are:
Delhi: Bharti Cellular (SFR of France) and Sterling Cellular (Cellular
Communications International of the US);
Calcutta: Usha Martin Telecom (Malaysia Telecom, the Malaysian carrier), and
Indian Telecom (OTC of Australia);
Madras: Skycell (Bell South of the US) and Mobile Telephone (the UK's
Vodaphone).
The big loser is Tata Cellular, a venture promoted by Tata, India's largest
industrial grouping, and Bell Canada of Canada, which has not succeeded in
securing any licences. Mr Sukh Ram said Tata had failed to meet the
ministry's technical and financial conditions.
The winning bidders expect to start placing orders soon. 'It's been a long
and bitter battle to get the contracts. Most of us expect to begin services
in April or May,' Mr Sunil Mittal, managing director of Bharti Telecom,
said.
Businessmen are delighted that India finally looks likely to get the
benefits of cellular telephones. A bank executive in Delhi yesterday said:
'It will make life much easier.'
Cellular telephones in developing countries are especially useful because
they can by-pass the inefficient basic network. In Pakistan, for example,
cellular telephones have virtually become a substitute for basic services
among those who can afford them.
In India, handsets will be imported and will cost about Rs25,000 (Dollars
796) each.
India said yesterday its dispute with US over an American ban on imports of
Indian rayon chiffon skirts had been resolved, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New
Delhi.
The Indian government said it had established a testing and certification
programme to ensure that all rayon chiffon skirts exported to the US
complied with US flammability standards.
India exported more than Rs1bn worth of the skirts to the US last year.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Clinton takes campaign trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton finally hit the campaign trail on Monday night by
venturing out into the Washington suburbs to raise money for Senator Chuck
Robb of Virginia.
The president told an enthusiastic rally he and the senator had been the
subject of unfair Republican attacks. 'They exalt fear over hope, division
over unity,' he said, 'and they are brilliant at it.'
He also took an oblique shot at Mr Oliver North, the Republican candidate.
Never mentioning him by name, Mr Clinton noted the biblical commandment
against bearing false witness, a clear reference to Mr North's conviction -
later overturned on a legal technicality - in the Iran-Contra scandals.
Senator Robb is one of the few Democratic candidates for election who has
openly embraced Mr Clinton and sought his help. Equally a large part of the
North campaign is to portray Mr Robb as 'Bill Clinton's senator,' thus
hoping to capitalise on the president's unpopularity in the country at large
and in Virginia, where he was defeated by President George Bush in the 1992
presidential election.
Political experts believe Mr Robb is taking a sizeable gamble in hitching
his star to Mr Clinton's sagging fortunes. However, the Virginia race
remains tighter than expected following the withdrawal last month of Mr Doug
Wilder, the former Democratic governor and independent candidate.
One recent poll gives Mr North a slim lead, with the third man Mr Marshall
Coleman, previously a Republican lieutenant governor, trailing badly. Mr
Wilder's withdrawal, it was assumed, would boost Mr Robb by unsplitting the
Democratic vote but the former governor still has not endorsed his party
rival.
Mr Robb is also being heavily outspent by Mr North, who is well financed by
the far right-wing and its religious supporters. The Republican campaign
chest is already Dollars 15m strong, while the Democratic incumbent has
raised only Dollars 3m and Mr Coleman less than Dollars 1m.
The estimated Dollars 500,000 generated by Mr Clinton's appearance at two
fundraisers on Monday night certainly helps Mr Robb, who has been unable to
match Mr North's televised commercial blitz.
The senator's aides reckoned that the new infusion of funds could buy 10
days worth of concentrated statewide TV advertising.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Canada to unveil radical social security blueprint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's Liberal government will today unveil a blueprint for overhauling a
panoply of generous but costly and increasingly ineffective social security
programmes. The proposals are likely to unleash a debate to test the
government's resolve against a plethora of special interest groups, and its
commitment to cutting the budget deficit.
In an effort to contain the political backlash and retain room for
manoeuvre, Mr Lloyd Axworthy, human resources minister, will present the
proposals in the form of a 'discussion paper'. He plans to introduce
detailed legislation next spring.
A government official said the options would reflect a new direction: 'Our
main aim is to see if we can move the public debate to a different place.'
The Liberals recognise they will be unable to meet their goal of cutting the
federal budget deficit to 3 per cent of GDP without trimming social security
outlays. The programmes in question now cost about CDollars 39bn (Pounds
18.30bn) a year, a third of total federal spending.
They include unemployment insurance, job training, child tax benefits and
transfers to the 10 provinces to fund welfare assistance and post-secondary
education. Old-age pensions will not be included in the review.
Agreement is widespread on the need to reform the social security net, many
components of which have been unchanged for the past three decades. Concern
centres on the growing group of able-bodied people who have fallen into a
'welfare trap' because of generous social security.
Unemployment insurance and social assistance payments now equal 4 per cent
of GNP against less than 1 per cent in the mid-1960s. The number of people
living below the poverty line has risen steadily. Leaks from Ottawa suggest
Mr Axworthy will propose targeting benefits more narrowly, creating
incentives to encourage people to look for work or acquire new skills.
The discussion paper is expected to suggest a clampdown on workers in such
seasonal industries as fishing and construction, who can claim generous
unemployment benefits after as little as 12 weeks' work. The government this
week unveiled a programme to top up the income of people who accept menial
jobs at minimum wages as a way of re-entering the workforce.
Mr Axworthy hopes to defuse criticism of the cuts with a proposal to divert
some savings from lower unemployment insurance and welfare payments to
support under-privileged children. The paper is also expected to propose
reforms in higher education funding, by replacing direct grants to
universities with more generous student loans.
The overhaul will be complicated by split responsibilities between the
federal government and the provinces.
Quebec's new separatist government has indicated it will not take part in
the process unless it considers the reforms to be to its own advantage.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton won a small victory yesterday, after weeks of
deadlock with Congress on different issues, when the Senate finally voted to
confirm his nominee to head the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,
writes George Graham in Washington.
The FDIC has been without a chairman since the death of Mr William Taylor
two years ago. The nomination of Ms Ricki Tigert, a Washington lawyer and
former Federal Reserve official, had been held up for 11 months by the
objections of Senator Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina.
Seven Republicans joined 56 Democrats in the Senate to give the 60 vote
majority needed to override Senator Faircloth's filibuster attempt. In a
second vote on the nomination, the Senate confirmed Ms Tigert by 90 to 7.
Mr Faircloth and Senator Alphonse d'Amato had criticised Ms Tigert for being
too closely tied to Mr and Mrs Clinton, and had already compelled her to
promise to step aside from any FDIC involvement in the Whitewater
investigation. This involves the Clintons' investment in an Arkansas
property venture and its links to a federally insured savings institution.
Democratic supporters of Ms Tigert said she was merely a Clinton
acquaintance.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Haitian police chief Lt-Col Michel Francois has fled to the neighbouring
Dominican Republic in a move that US officials say will go a long way
towards reforming the country's dreaded police force.
Col Francois was initially detained by Dominican officials, who would not
let him cross the border. The officials, later relented and allowed him in
on a tourist visa. Intelligence officials later confirmed Col Francois had
arrived in Santo Domingo.
Haiti's military leaders, scheduled to step down by October 15, did not
immediately appoint a new police chief and Mr Stanley Schrager of the US
embassy suggested the post may remain vacant until exiled President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide chooses someone to fill it.
With Col Francois removed, US officials began to implement their plan for a
new police force, selecting a site for a temporary training academy, where
eventually 4,000 new officers will be trained.
Hopes of a peaceful transition to democratic rule were further boosted
yesterday when Mr Emmanuel Constant, head of the Front for the Advancement
and Progress of Haiti (Fraph), urged his followers to end the violence and
support the return of President Aristide. The leader of the main
paramilitary group said Fraph would serve as a 'constructive opposition'.
Mr Constant's plea came a day after the US military stormed Fraph
headquarters. US troops detained fewer than 100 of the several thousand
members of Fraph but military patrols increased.
'It is becoming clear there is a new sheriff in town,' said Mr Schrager,
expressing hope that Lt-Gen Raoul Cedras, Haiti's military strongman,would
join Col Francois in leaving the country.
At the United Nations yesterday President Aristide said he planned to return
home after three years in exile by October 15 at the latest.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US government index pointing to future economic activity rose in August
by the largest amount since March, led by strong orders for consumer goods
and materials.
The index of leading economic indicators went up by 0.6 per cent in the
month, following no change in July and a modest 0.2 per cent advance in
June.
In March the index had jumped by 0.7 per cent.
The August performance, confirming the National Association of Purchasing
Managers report, published on Monday and showing continuing strong
expansion, was in line with market expectations and had little early impact
on equity prices.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up about 7 points in morning trading.
Nine of the 11 component parts of the index rose last month.
The largest contributions were made by manufacturers' new orders, vendor
performance, state unemployment benefits claims and stock prices.
Two elements declined - the money supply and unfilled orders by
manufacturers.
The overall increase meant the index was 3.8 per cent higher than a year
ago, according to the commerce department.
But market analysts expected a smaller increase in September.

Sao Paulo's main stock market index fell 2.7 per cent at the close
yesterday, in spite of the financial markets' optimism at the election
success of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
Many analysts said a Cardoso victory had already been priced into the
market, which has nearly doubled in dollar terms this year, and is up by
about 65 per cent since July 1.
However, they also expect a period of post-election profit-taking,
particularly by foreign investors, which could mean a flat or downwards
market in the short term. According to Mr Roberto Serweczak, head of trading
at stockbroker Baring Securities in Sao Paulo, the market will be looking
for news about how far and how quickly Mr Cardoso is prepared to go in
economic reforms and privatisation.
Although some foreign investors in equities will be taking profits, there is
likely to be a substantial increase in overall foreign portfolio investment
over the coming months.
Mr Marcelo Cabral, an international equities vice president at Morgan
Stanley in New York, said: 'Global investors are significantly underbought
in Brazil and it will become very hard to stay out of the country if Cardoso
implements economic reforms.'
But progress will be gradual, says equities analyst Ms Monalisa Guarda:
'Changes will not be as dramatic as in Argentina. I expect a slower but
coherent programme, and a gradual increase in foreign investment.'
However, the government could try to restrict overseas investment in
equities if there is an extremely large dollar inflow. Since its July 1
launch the new currency, the Real, has appreciated by 15 per cent against
the dollar. The government is worried that a big inflow of foreign exchange
will put more pressure on the exchange rate, forcing the central bank to
compromise money supply targets by buying dollars and issuing Reals.
But most analysts believe the government would only target overseas
investment as a last resort, partly because the government will need foreign
investors for its privatisation programme.
Prices of Brazilian overseas debt securities were stable yesterday morning,
said traders, although prices had moved up in the days preceding the
election and are up by about a quarter since May.
Analysts say future prices will depend on the confidence of foreign
investors in Mr Cardoso's reforms as well as the success of a fund, approved
by the government last month, which allows Brazilians to invest in sovereign
debt.
The Real was trading half a cent up yesterday morning, at Dollars 1.18.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Cardoso cruising to easy election victory

First results from Brazil's presidential elections on Monday suggested Mr
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former finance minister, was set to score an
easy victory over his main rival, the left winger Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da
Silva.
By yesterday afternoon, with about 700,000 votes counted - less than 1 per
cent of the total - Mr Cardoso had more than 50 per cent of valid votes
cast.
This compared with about 23 per cent for Mr da Silva. The results, which
mainly came from the country's more developed south, were in line with exit
polls released on Monday night, which predicted a nationwide victory for Mr
Cardoso by a wide margin.
The first results also confirmed opinion poll projections that Mr Cardoso
would poll more votes than all his competitors, thereby winning the election
outright without the need for a second-round run off.
Mr Cardoso was reported to be resting in Sao Paulo state yesterday, and is
waiting for more votes to be counted before commenting on the results or
claiming victory.
Counting is likely to take at least 10 days, but Mr Cardoso is expected to
return to Braslia today or tomorrow and give a press conference on his plans
as future president.
His mandate does not begin until January 1 and he is expected to use the
next months to build a cabinet and prepare a number of economic and tax
reforms to underpin the Real currency, introduced earlier this year.
The exit polls suggested a strong showing for Mr Eneas Carneiro, the
far-right candidate who seemed to have appealed to Brazilians seeking to
cast a protest vote. He looked set to receive 6 per cent of the votes and
finish third, ahead of established politicians such as Mr Orestes Quercia
and Mr Leonel Brizola, former governors of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro
respectively.
In spite of Mr Cardoso's strong showing, some of his political allies
appeared to be in trouble. Mr Mario Covas, until recently clear favourite to
win the governorship of Sao Paulo, Brazil's most important state, appeared
to have lost support and may face a second round run-off. Mr Antonio Britto,
who was also expected to easily win the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul,
also looked to be heading for a surprise second round run-off.
Also up for grabs in the elections were 27 state governorships, 54 of 81
Senate seats, all 513 lower house deputies and 1,059 state legislators.
Voting was festive and peaceful across the country, although a ban on
last-minute campaigning was widely ignored.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Left academic finds right stuff: From 'dependency' theorist
to reluctant neo-liberal / Profile of Cardoso
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, likely to be Brazil's next president, is a
former left-wing professor turned politician who has moved steadily towards
the right in the last 10 years. Many Brazilians are now asking how much
further he will move to govern a country still controlled by conservative
elites.
Mr Cardoso, 63, is a popular and respected figure in Brazilian politics,
whose charm and a relaxed style with the media helped win the election. He
speaks several foreign languages and is reputed to have a liking for French
cooking and poker.
His experience of government is limited to brief spells at the foreign and
finance ministries, where he sometimes appeared excessively cautious. Given
the size of the economic and social problems he will inherit, a tendency to
be indecisive could damage his presidency.
Born into a wealthy military family, he is one of the outstanding Brazilians
of his generation. He trained as a sociologist and later taught at the
University of California at Berkeley and Cambridge. His best known works
explored 'dependency', a theory which sought to explain Latin America's
'underdevelopment' as a consequence of the continent's dependence on capital
and technology from the US and Europe.
His understanding of Brazil's social problems will be important because the
country has one of the biggest gaps between rich and poor with millions
living in shanty towns, often without health and education services. Mr
Cardoso, whose anthropologist wife Ruth has strong views on social issues,
says the country needs to become 'more humanitarian' and to end its 'social
injustice'.
His links with the left led to trouble with Brazil's military rulers in the
1970s and he was banned from teaching at the University of Sao Paulo. When
democracy returned to Brazil in 1985, Mr Cardoso switched to politics and
was elected a senator for Sao Paulo in 1986.
He helped form a new political party, the Social Democrats (PSDB), which has
gained a reputation for good - and clean - government in several Brazilian
states. Mr Cardoso joined the government of President Itamar Franco in 1992
after the ousting of former President Fernando Collor on corruption charges.
In May last year, against his instincts and the advice of friends who
thought the job a poisoned chalice, he was persuaded by President Franco to
become Brazil's fourth finance minister in less than a year.
Once appointed, Mr Cardoso often reminded interviewers that he was not an
economist. But his political skills allowed him to negotiate through
congress a package of economic measures in preparation for the launch of a
new currency, the Real. It worked, and monthly inflation fell from 50 per
cent in June to less than 2 per cent in September.
It was this that won Mr Cardoso the election, helped by an alliance with the
right-wing Liberal Front (PFL) party that delivered him votes in Brazil's
poor north-east. The alliance was unpopular with some of Mr Cardoso's
supporters because the PFL is controlled by the same old-style politicians
Mr Cardoso used to criticise and blame for Brazil's social problems.
Advisers say he needed the alliance to win the election. But critics say it
showed Mr Cardoso was too ready to compromise his principals for politics.
They worry that his commitment to tackling social problems, such as
promoting fairer land ownership, will be shelved if reform threatens the
entrenched interests of conservative politicians and business groups.
Mr Cardoso says he is a social democrat and bridles when described as a
'neo-liberal' who expects market forces to solve Brazil's problems.
'The market cannot solve problems of poverty,' he said, adding that the
state should remain an active provider of social services. In his election
manifesto, he said the state should remain involved in certain undefined
'strategic' areas of the economy.
But, in the short term at least, it seems he will have to follow policies
that have been described as 'neo-liberal' elsewhere in Latin America. To
balance the government's budget it is likely he will have to privatise
state-owned companies faster than he might like. He has said the state's
monopoly on telecommunications and mineral extraction can be lifted, but has
so far rejected a full-scale privatisation of Petrobras, the state-owned oil
monopoly.
To guarantee the continued success of the Real currency, he will also have
to overhaul the federal government's budget and its social security system.
This will require increasing the tax take and government spending cuts.
State pensions may be frozen and stricter rules introduced to stop workers
retiring early.
Economists agree such changes are needed as Brazil modernises its economy
and government. They say that the fact that it is a former left-wing
sociologist proposing the reforms shows there is now a consensus in Brazil
for a smaller, more efficient state in a market economy, in line with other
countries in the region.
Mr Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, leader of the PFL and one of the old-style
politicians Mr Cardoso used to rail against, said there was another possible
explanation. 'Fernando Henrique Cardoso was always politically further to
the right of centre than we had thought,' he said.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Who next? Reformers fear the assassin in Mexico - The
aftermath of the killing of another PRI leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Mr Ernesto Zedillo, Mexico's next president, had any doubts about the
difficulties of reforming Mexico's governing party and the country's corrupt
judicial and legal system, the assassination last week of Mr Jose Francisco
Ruiz Massieu, the party's number two official, will probably have removed
them.
Mr Ruiz Massieu's killing was allegedly ordered by Mr Manuel Munoz Rocha, a
federal deputy of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI), and Mr
Abraham Rubio Canales, a former tourism developer with strong links to the
Gulf drug cartel in the state of Tamaulipas.
The two allegedly hired the gunman, and other accomplices, according to
testimony from one man who has confessed to his role in the killing.
This alleged alliance between a hardliner in the governing party and a man
with links to a drug gang has underlined concerns that efforts by Mr Zedillo
to reform his party and the country's criminal justice system will be met
with fierce and violent resistance from those who stand to lose from these
changes.
According to testimony from the alleged accomplices to the assassination,
the conspirators drew up a list of reform-minded politicians with plans to
kill all of them.
Since Mr Ruiz Massieu's assassination, there has been renewed speculation
that political reactionaries and drug traffickers may have had a hand in the
killing six months ago of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling party's
reform-minded presidential candidate, even though no evidence has emerged to
indicate this is the case.
Mr Carlos Fuentes, the novelist, asked yesterday in a newspaper article
entitled 'Who is next?' whether Mexico, like Colombia, was facing a period
of sustained political violence orchestrated by drug barons. Other
columnists have insinuated that more groups than currently revealed might be
involved in Mr Ruiz Massieu's murder.
Mr Munoz Rocha has promised to hand himself in if his safety is guaranteed,
according to a statement by Mexico's Congress. Two newspapers reported
yesterday that Mr Munoz Rocha has admitted to a role in the crime but put
the responsibility on Mr Rubio Canales, who reportedly blames Mr Ruiz
Massieu for his conviction for fraud in 1992, and the prison sentence he is
currently serving.
Mr Munoz Rocha said he participated in the assassination 'because I was
angry that I had not been supported in my political aspirations'.
The ruling party has denied that the crime reflects an internal battle
between ideological factions in the PRI. Mr Ignacio Pichardo, the president
of the party, declared on Monday that Mr Munoz Rocha 'never had intellectual
interests, never raised issues of political theory, and was never associated
with making ideological pronouncements.'
Mr Pichardo insisted that the reform of the PRI would go ahead. As if to
underline this pledge, Ms Maria de los Angeles Moreno, the head of the PRI
group in the Chamber of Deputies and a reformist, was appointed to replace
Mr Ruiz Massieu as the party's secretary-general.
Government officials have suggested the Gulf drug cartel may have
deliberately involved Mr Munoz Rocha in the assassination to maximise the
political impact of the crime.
The motives of drug traffickers are uncertain. One view is they believed the
assassination would weaken Mr Ruiz Massieu's brother, Mario, who is the
deputy attorney general in charge of drug enforcement.
If this was the motivation, the plan may have backfired. Mr Ruiz Massieu has
taken charge of the investigation into his brother's death, and search for
drug cartel members appears to have intensified.
Another view is the cartel was seeking revenge. Mr Mario Ruiz Massieu
recently had arrested Raul Valladares, top lieutenant in the Gulf Cartel and
son-in-law of Mr Rubio Canales, the man in the Acapulco jail accused of
jointly plotting the assassination.

FT  05 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank in Madrid: Ecuador signs deal on debt of
Dollars 7.8bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Ecuador yesterday signed an agreement with about 300 private creditors, led
by international banks, to restructure its Dollars 7.8bn (Pounds 5bn) of
external commercial debt.
About 99 per cent of creditors, in a deal that coincided with the IMF
meeting in Madrid, agreed to terms offered in June. Sir David Walker, deputy
chairman of Lloyds Bank, which led the negotiating committee of banks,
called for Ecuador to allow its creditors to take part in a forthcoming
privatisation programme through equity swaps.
Among the largest creditors agreeing to the restructuring was the Dart
family of the US, which acquired its debt in the secondary market. The Darts
are suing Brazil in the US courts over its debt restructuring. One banker
said Ecuador had been more successful in dealing with private creditors such
as the Darts because 'it was aware that it was dealing with more than banks,
and it was careful to maintain a dialogue'.
The Dollars 2.5bn of past due interest which has accumulated on the
principal debt will be repaid by Ecuador issuing 20-year bonds which have a
10-year grace period before principal repayments fall due.
During the first six years, Ecuador can choose whether to pay the coupon on
these bonds in full, or pay a lower coupon and capitalise the balance. It
can thus reduce the initial burden of repayments.
Sir David said that the deal was 'sensitive to the needs of Ecuador' but it
was 'vital that a track record of uninterrupted payments is now
established'. Ecuador started failing to meet interest payments in 1987.
Mr Modesto Correa, the Ecuadorean minister of finance, said that the country
was 'now poised to return to the international capital markets, and resume
its place as a member of the international financial community'. He said the
government was committed to a process of economic stabilisation and
structural reform, and the debt burden had been 'a grave obstacle' to
progress.
The package, modelled on similar agreements pioneered by Mr Nicholas Brady,
former US treasury secretary, offered holders of debt principal a choice
between exchanging it for two types of 30-year bonds.

FT  05 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank in Madrid: Visitors' advice upsets the hosts

<TEXT>
The Spanish hosts have taken offence at some of the robust economic advice
handed out by IMF experts.
Members of Spain's moderate Socialist government, doubtless feeling the
pressure from large-scale street demonstrations against the two
international bodies and their impact on developing countries and the
environment, hit out at the 'ultra-liberal' IMF recipes proposed for Spain's
own economy.
Recommendations put forward by IMF experts at the weekend included freedom
of companies to hire and fire workers and cuts in pensions and other social
benefits.
Spain earlier this year introduced measures to ease the notoriously strict
rules governing redundancies, but is reluctant to incur further wrath from
trade unions by pushing its reforms further at present.
Mr Jose Antonio Grinan, labour minister, said it was 'shameful and wrong' to
present as scientific truth something that was 'no more than political
opinion'. Junior employment minister, Mr Marcos Pena, used stronger
language, calling the proposals 'financial fundamentalism'.
Mr Candido Mendez, leader of the UGT trade union, said the ideas were just
'stupid'. Even the conservative opposition Popular party said the proposals
for unrestricted hiring and firing were 'excessive'. Only Mr Jose Maria
Cuevas, head of the CEOE employers' federation, said such measures were
'absolutely necessary'.
Mr Jorge Hay, general manager at Banco Central Hispano and a former World
Bank official, said he could not understand the criticism, saying Spain was
a successful example of the services provided by the two institutions.
'Spain owes a lot to the IMF,' he said. 'The first milestone marking the
modernisation of the country was the IMF mission of 1959; we have
subsequently had two standby agreements.
'The World Bank has given Spain a dozen loans that in current terms would be
worth Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) and which have helped Spain rebuild its
infrastructure and develop agrarian projects and education.'

<TEXT>
Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund,
yesterday emphasised that the IMF would not weaken its insistence on sound
economic policies in countries to which it gives financial assistance.
Mr Camdessus told the annual meeting of the IMF/World Bank that this was 'a
responsibility we owe to our members in difficulty', in order for the IMF to
preserve its role as a catalyst for other forms of investment.
The IMF would continue to adapt its instruments of financial assistance. He
cited efforts to put together a package to help meet the needs of developing
countries and those in transition from communism.
'The fund's endorsement of policies is what other creditors and donors look
for before providing their own support. The fund's seal of approval must
maintain its credibility, and we shall ensure that it will,' he said.
Mr Camdessus said the fund's tasks of promoting exchange rate stability
faced new challenges from the globalisation of financial markets which had
sharply increased the risk of some countries being marginalised.
Strong surveillance of economic policies was essential because a global
market meant a bigger risk of domestic policy mistakes in one country
spilling over into others, and increasing exchange rate volatility.
The fund would have to 'further intensify our efforts' to promote current
account convertibility by eliminating exchange controls. Sixteen more
countries had accepted their treaty obligations for this since last year.
Mr Camdessus said the role of the special drawing right (SDR) - the reserve
asset that can be created by the IMF - should be the subject of an in-depth
study, taking account of the development of the European currency unit.
Mr Camdessus thus signalled his continued interest in promoting the SDR in
the world monetary system.
Predictably, yesterday's formal opening session of the IMF-World Bank
meeting yielded no progress towards resolving the dispute between the Group
of Seven industrialised countries and developing nations over an SDR
allocation.
In spite of Mr Camdessus's opposition to the G7's plans on the SDR, the IMF
managing director was given ringing endorsement by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK
chancellor and one of the G7 finance ministers.
'I personally like and admire Mr Camdessus,' the chancellor told a press
conference. 'I enjoy working with him, I like his enthusiasm, and he's a man
who inspires one with his competence and technical grasp,' Mr Clarke said.
In his speech to the meeting, Mr Lewis Preston, president of the World Bank,
said that the bank had to be more selective in its assistance, tailoring it
to the needs of countries, and focusing on issues where it would have the
most impact.
The bank also had to collaborate more effectively with its partners,
including the non-governmental organisations which took part in half the
projects supported by the bank last year.

FT  05 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank in Madrid: Lesson in north-south row - Ties
between G7
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some good may yet emerge from this week's failure of members of the
International Monetary Fund to agree an increase in world monetary reserves.
The stand-off in the talks on a proposed allocation of the IMF's own reserve
asset - known as special drawing rights - exposed such a gulf between the
big industrialised nations and the developing world that policy makers have
begun considering improving methods of communication and co-operation
between the two sides.
Immediately after the meeting, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor,
complained that decision-making processes of the IMF's policy-making interim
committee could be improved.
Since the acrimonious break up of the talks, officials from the Group of
Seven leading industrial countries have been pondering how the two sides in
such a long arranged meeting could go into negotiations without a proper
understanding of the strength of the other side's position.
Part of the problem, according to one senior G7 official, is that the level
of official communications between the industrialised nations and the
so-called developing countries no longer reflects the growing importance of
many nations in Asia and Latin America.
G7 monetary officials have had 20 years of increasingly intensive
collaboration among themselves. The preparations for the annual economic
summits, the regular meetings of G7 finance ministers, as well as frequent
meetings in committees run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (and in the case of the European G7 countries in the European
Union), have created a nexus of contacts. Seniors officials in the G7
finance ministries and central banks talk by telephone practically every
day.
There are ties between G7 and developing nations but they are far less
intense. Partly for this reason, officials believe, the developing nations
were too willing to believe that Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing
director, could deliver a general allocation of SDRs on Sunday and so
rejected the G7 offer of a smaller, one-off selected increase.
One problem is working out suitable forums for greater co-operation. There
have been suggestions that the deputy finance ministers of the countries
represented on the interim committee should confer ahead of its meetings to
help resolve issues. The G7 deputies meet frequently in this way and their
co-operation is said to be one of the main reasons for the relatively smooth
running of the group.
However, the interim committee is a much bigger group with 24 members,
prompting fears that meetings of interim committee deputies would be
unwieldy and unproductive.
Such ideas were starting to circulate among officials even before Sunday's
debacle showed how the G7 cannot dictate to the developing world.
Officials say the industrial countries need to respond to the growing
economic importance of the developing countries. They are growing rapidly:
the IMF has forecast that as a group they will expand at twice the rate of
the industrial countries this year and next.
They are becoming increasingly integrated in the world economy. The General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade predicted this week that the developing
nations would boost their trade far more as a result of the Uruguay Round
liberalisation measures than the OECD countries.
Many developing countries, such as China, Mexico and Argentina are regional
powers. Following Sunday's events, there are also strong damage-control
grounds for promoting closer links.
The developing nations have shown a remarkable willingness to apply the
lessons of market-driven economics over the past decade. Many now appear to
be more enthusiastic free-traders than big industrialised nations. The
ideological differences that used to divide north and south have largely
disappeared. An important reason for officials from the G7 and other
industrialised nations to strengthen their ties with developing countries
would be to head off any revival of the north-south divisions of the 1960s
and 1970s.

The World Bank intends to increase sharply the financial guarantees it makes
available to commercial lenders and private investors to encourage greater
private investment in infrastructure.
Dr Ashoka Mody, principal financial economist at the bank's Project Finance
Group, said yesterday that partial credit guarantees would allow projects to
repay commercial loans over a longer period and provide insurance against
government agencies failing to meet contractual obligations.
Dr Mody's comments at a Financial Times conference on international
infrastructure finance in London represent an important policy shift by the
bank which previously has lent mainly to governments and their agencies.
The bank has outstanding loans of Dollars 104bn (Pounds 65.8bn) compared to
financial guarantees to private-sector lenders covering just Dollars 1bn of
loans.
Dr Mody said that the bank's executive directors intended to step up the use
of guarantees for private capital projects, making them 'a mainstream
instrument of bank operations.'
About Dollars 200bn a year was spent on infrastructure, of which less than
Dollars 15bn came from private sources. This proportion was expected to rise
sharply as governments found it increasingly difficult to finance
large-scale projects out of public funds.
Dr Jacques Rogozinski, president of Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios
Publicos (Banobras), the Mexican state-owned public works bank, wanted the
World Bank to provide direct investment to private infrastructure projects
as well as financial guarantees.
Dr Mody and Dr Rogozinski stressed financial guarantees and direct
investment by state bodies should not be used to underwrite normal
commercial risks. Dr Rogozinski said: 'If operators have got their sums
wrong, it should be their responsibility. If this means they fail, so be
it'.
The Chinese authorities are understood to have agreed to increase the rates
of return available to private-sector investors in infrastructure projects
in China. Mr John Mobsby, head of project finance at W S Atkins, the UK
engineering consultant, told the conference that the rate of return was
likely to be raised to around 15 per cent.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Nigeria cuts fuel price rise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Nigeria's military regime yesterday reduced an earlier 400 per cent rise in
the official price of fuel in an attempt to win public support as the
economy continues to decline.
In his broadcast speech, head of state General Sani Abacha cut the official
prices by 26 per cent to N11 (30p) per litre for petrol, by 25 per cent to
N9 per litre for diesel, and by 40 per cent to N6 per litre for kerosene.
The price of fuel oil was cut to N7 a litre.
Industry experts say that N12 per litre of fuel is the break-even price for
the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, but Gen Abacha said
the increased revenue would be spent on public services.
He promised 1,000 new buses for public transport and higher spending on
social services.
The earlier steep increases in fuel prices were never officially announced
and their reduction on Tuesday was not explained by Gen Abacha who said all
Nigerians had to tighten their belts and make sacrifices.
Gen Abacha blamed the price rises on high maintenance costs and the need to
import fuel during recent strikes and shutdowns affecting the oil industry.
'What we spend must come from what we earn,' said Gen Abacha. 'The day of
reckoning has already come true.'
Confusion over fuel pricing is the latest evidence of the government's
chaotic handling of the economy. The removal of the price subsidy is a
condition for aid and debt relief from the IMF and the Paris Club but the
government is far from meeting other criteria.
Payments on Nigeria's external debts of Pounds 28bn are more than Dollars
7bn in arrears, government spending is out of control and heading for a
large 1994 deficit and the parallel market value of the naira has halved in
the nine months since Gen Abacha seized power.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Indonesian army 'to keep role in politics'

Indonesia's army will continue to play a political role in the country for a
long time yet, senior military officials said in Jakarta yesterday.
At a meeting between foreign media and military personnel, Lt Gen HB
Mantiri, chief of staff for general affairs, said the military's role in
civilian affairs will 'go on forever and ever'.
The Indonesian constitution contains a legal basis for what is known as the
military's 'dual function', its civilian and military role.
'We are like shepherds,' said Gen Mantiri. 'Sometimes we are in the middle
of politics, sometimes ahead and sometimes behind.'
The military's emphasis on internal political affairs, rather than creating
a professional army, has had its costs. Gen Mantiri admitted the army was
under-equipped when it came to defending Indonesia's many islands.
This was one of the reasons Indonesia had bought a fleet of 39 former East
German warships, a controversial acquisition. 'But even when these ships
come, our equipment is still not yet up to the minimum standard because we
have to cover such a big country.'
The acquisition of the former East German warships was a hotly-debated topic
between Mr JB Habibie, minister for research and technology, and Mr Marie
Muhammad, minister of finance, who argued the purchase was too expensive.
Lively coverage of the argument which split the ruling elite prompted the
forced closures of three popular general news magazines in June this year.
Former employees at DeTik, one of the magazines banned in June, have now
joined a weekly newspaper called Simponi, which was launched on Monday this
week. Asked if the military would allow this magazine to survive, Gen
Mantiri said: 'We hope it will live for a long time, but it depends on them.
If, like the other three magazines, they do not heed our warnings, they may
only last one day or one week.'
Indonesia, which encompasses more than 13,000 islands and 187m people, has a
long history of military involvement in politics. President Suharto, who has
governed the country since 1967, was an ex-army general himself. The
Indonesian military differs from other military forces in south-east Asia
because its role in socio-political affairs is enshrined in the law.

The Indian government has announced partial disinvestment in seven state
undertakings, including two oil groups and a telephone services company, as
part of its continuing disinvestment programme. This will allow foreign
investors to bid for shares in public-sector enterprises for the first time.
Private companies, banks, financial institutions, mutual funds and
registered brokers have been invited to bid for equity ranging from 2 to 20
per cent in some of India's leading public-sector companies.
Indian Oil Corporation, which owns six petroleum refineries and has a
3,850km pipeline network to distribute its petroleum products, will
disinvest 5 per cent of its capital, or 18.4m shares.
The cash-rich Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, which has had a monopoly of
oil exploration and drilling in India for decades, will disinvest 2 per cent
of its capital.
Five per cent or 30m shares of Mahanagar Telephone Nigam, which controls
telecommunications services in Bombay and Delhi, 5 per cent or 199.3m shares
of the Steel Authority of India, which owns four integrated steel plants, 10
per cent or 28.2m shares of the Shipping Corporation of India, 20 per cent
or 12.9m shares of the Container Corporation of India and 10 per cent or
49.1m shares of National Fertilisers would also be on offer.
A government notification said sealed tenders for the purchase of shares for
a minimum amount of Rs25,000 (Pounds 500) would be accepted by the
Department of Public Enterprises in the Industries Ministry between October
5 and 17. Earlier rounds of disinvestment have had limits of Rs20m for
minimum bids, deterring potential bidders.
Foreign institutional investors permitted by the Securities and Exchange
Board of India to buy and sell shares in India will be eligible to bid,
provided they fulfil conditions of purchase and ownership stipulated by the
Securities Board. Non-resident Indians and overseas corporate bodies are
also eligible to apply.
The government plans to disinvest up to 49 per cent of state-owned
enterprises, and is doing so in phases, hoping to raise Rs40bn (Pounds 800m)
in 1994-95. It raised Rs72.4bn in six rounds of disinvestment of
public-sector companies between April 1991 and March 1994.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Industrial robots 'set to soar by one third': Potential for
expansion enormous, says report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The world's industrial robot population is forecast to soar by more than a
third over the four years to 1997, according to a report published by the
United Nations Economic Commission for Europe and the International
Federation of Robotics yesterday.*
The report, the first in an annual series, says sagging growth in robot
investment bottomed out in 1993 and numbers are set to jump from 610,000 at
the end of last year to more than 830,000 by the end of 1997. Annual sales
are predicted to rise from about 54,000 units in 1993 to more than 103,000
units in 1997.
Japan accounts for more than half the world's robot stock, equivalent to 325
robots for every 10,000 manufacturing workers. It is followed by Singapore
(109), Sweden (73), Italy (70) and Germany (62).
Use of robots is most widespread in the motor vehicle industry, which
accounts for between a third and more than one-half of robots in use in
countries such as France, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and
Britain.
Though Japan now has the highest number of robots in the electrical and
electronic industry, it remains the world leader by far in the use of robots
for vehicle manufacture.
In the transport equipment sector, which includes motor vehicles, Japan has
1,000 robots for every 10,000 workers, compared with 167 in Sweden, 110 in
France and 63 in Britain.
In most countries, especially those with big motor vehicle industries,
robots are used most frequently for welding.
But in some countries machining is the most common application. In Japan 40
per cent of the robot stock is used for assembly, reflecting the large-scale
use of robots in the electronic sector.
The potential for expansion of robotics is enormous. Numbers would explode
if other industrialised countries were to reach Japan's robot densities and
if industry in general were to reach only half the robot density of the
motor vehicle sector.
If all industries in France and Britain had half as many robots as the motor
industry in these countries, the robot stock would more than double. If it
reached half the density of the Japanese motor vehicle industry, it would
increase more than 20-fold.

Mr Hong Jae-hyong, South Korean finance minister, was promoted yesterday to
deputy prime minister for economic planning in a reshuffle of the country's
economic ministries.
He succeeds Mr Chung Jai-suk, who resigned due to ill health 10 months after
he was named to the post.
Mr Park Jae-yoon, senior presidential economic adviser, was appointed the
new finance minister, while Mr Han Lee-hun, the vice-economic planning
minister, will replace Mr Park. The three senior officials have been among
the main architects of proposals to deregulate South Korea's economy and
promote financial liberalisation.
'The scope of the cabinet reshuffle has been minimised with a view to
maintaining the current economic policy,' a presidential spokesman said.
Analysts expect little change in economic strategy, though the new team may
try to speed planned reforms. Mr Hong has held various economic posts since
1963.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese government was yesterday suffering diplomatic discomfiture over
the activities of a visiting senior Taiwanese official at the Asian games in
Hiroshima.
Five members of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party plan to meet Mr Hsu
Li Teh, Taiwan's deputy premier, in Tokyo today in defiance of party
instructions to shun all contact with him. The government wants to avoid
offending China, a powerful ally, market and investment destination.
The meeting, while deliberately smaller than the grand dinner the
pro-Taiwanese LDP politicians had originally planned, will anger China
despite the Japanese government's attempts to prevent sports and politics
from becoming entangled.
Japan cut official ties with Taiwan and opened relations with Beijing in
1972, implying acceptance of China's belief that Taiwan is still a
Chinese-owned province. But a significant pro-Taiwan movement remains in
Japanese national politics, making it uncomfortable for the government to
take clear sides between Taiwan and China.
In an attempt to prove to China that Japan does not condone official
contacts with Taiwan, Mr Yohei Kono, the LDP's president and Japanese
foreign minister, yesterday cancelled a trip to the Hiroshima games
scheduled for next weekend. Chinese government objections to a planned visit
to the games by Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui led to his last-minute
withdrawal and replacement by the deputy prime minister, who it was hoped
would take a low profile.
Mr Hsu rekindled the dispute over Japan's ambivalent attitude to Taiwan
yesterday by claiming in a newspaper interview his visit had 'a political
meaning'. A Japanese official accused him of a 'breach of promise'. Also,
China has objected to a social meeting between Mr Hsu and Japan's education
minister.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Iran's leaders try to stay a step ahead of critics:
Inflation and debt overshadow economic reform advances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most Iranians tend to subscribe to one of two explanations for their
economic plight: that prices are kept deliberately high to keep their minds
off politics; or that clerics are incapable of running an economy.
Such disaffection is a valuable political weapon in the hands of opposition
groups. The latest denunciation of Iran's clerical rulers, headed by
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the spiritual leader, came last week from a retired
army general.
General Azizollah Amir Rahimi, who was made a general after the overthrow of
the Shah in 1979, last week called for an end to censorship, the resignation
of the government and free elections.
Gen Rahimi, a former commander of the Tehran military police, is one of a
dwindling band of elderly Tehran-based opposition figures reluctantly
tolerated by the regime - although they are arrested from time to time  -
mainly because it does not regard them as a serious threat.
Opponents of the regime also point to Iran's growing debt burden in recent
years. The country had an unblemished payments record until 1992 when an
import spree resulted in delays in payment of letters of credit.
The man widely held responsible for this and for falls in the value of the
rial, Mr Hossein Adeli, stepped down as governor of the central bank three
weeks ago, having seen out his five-year term despite fierce criticism by
sections of the majlis (parliament) and press. Before leaving office, Mr
Adeli managed to organise the rescheduling of at least Dollars 8bn of Iran's
total Dollars 20bn-Dollars 30bn debt.
Critics of Mr Adeli's policies will not be heartened by his replacement  -
Mr Mohsen Nurbakhsh, economic adviser to Mr Rafsanjani and, until August
last year, minister of economics and finance who was unseated after losing a
vote of confidence in the majlis. He is returning to an old job - he was
governor of the central bank from 1981-86 when he established a reputation
as an able administrator.
Mr Nurbakhsh stressed that there would be no shift in direction in the
central bank's policies and that he would be 'making the least changes in
rules and regulations . . . . I think that the changing of rules is an
impeding factor in economic growth and development.'
An economics graduate of the University of California, he said he intended
to establish normal banking ties with other countries and to put banking
services at the centre of the financial and business community, so that
'there is little need for referring to unofficial networks and those
operating outside the banking system'.
Mr Nurbakhsh also said that he aimed to create a single exchange rate and on
Sunday, he made a move in this direction by declaring transactions outside
banks or authorised exchange houses illegal. Yesterday the Tehran daily,
Abrar, reported dozens of arrests of illegal dealers.
A short-lived attempt at unifying the three main exchange rate bands was
abandoned in May, after a steep fall in the exchange rate towards the end of
last year. The free market value of the Iranian rial has fallen to
one-fortieth of its value against the dollar since 1979 but the dollar's
official exchange rate is 1,750 rials.
The fall in the rial's value has made exports more expensive but at the same
time prices for oil, on which the state depends for more than 80 per cent of
its foreign exchange, remain relatively low.
High inflation has been a persistent problem, exacerbated in the late 1980s
by the central bank printing money to help the government meet its budget
deficit. Last month, Ayatollah Khamenei again drew attention to the problem
of inflation: 'High prices have created problems for specific strata. I do
not believe this problem is unavoidable. Officials should strive to solve
the problems faced by these strata.'
Mr Rafsanjani has been trying to shift part of the state's costly economic
burden to the private sector. A government coupon system entitling everyone
to basic necessities at low prices operates at a high cost to the state.
However, Mr Rafsanjani's attempts to phase it out in favour of cash support
for the needy are opposed by the majlis, which is worried about the
political consequences.
Earlier this month, the majlis voted against cutting subsidies on food and
medicine costing the government about Dollars 1.7bn a year. However, it
approved in principle a rise in petrol and fuel prices, details of which
will be debated next month.
Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, the oil minister is seeking a fourfold rise in
petrol prices from 50 rials a litre (about 3 US cents at the official
exchange rate) to 220 rials. The government says that oil subsidies cost it
Dollars 11bn a year - almost as much as it expects to earn in oil revenues
this year.
Attempts to attract foreign investment have been largely unsuccessful
because of continually changing economic measures and shifts in economic
direction.
However, late last month Nestle, the Swiss food manufacturer, signed a joint
venture agreement with a private Iranian company to establish a baby formula
and infant cereal factory at a cost of SFr60m (Pounds 29.7m).

FT  05 OCT 94 / China plans reform of state enterprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China has unveiled a six-point plan to overhaul its ailing state-owned
enterprises. The scheme aims at transforming government businesses into
shareholding companies with management independent of official controls.
The China Securities newspaper quoted a representative of the State Economic
and Trade Commission as saying that 'substantial reforms of the state-owned
enterprises have become vital for further economic development'. But China's
approach to enterprise reform has been faltering and change is being
constrained by worries about unemployment among state sector workers.
These concerns have been exacerbated by the latest bout of inflation.
Government attempts to bring prices under control seem to have deflected
attention from reforms.
According to official estimates, approximately one-third of China's 11,000
large and medium state-owned enterprises loses money, another third is said
to be breaking even and the remaining companies are profitable.
Western economists, however, doubt this assessment and believe the number of
loss-making businesses is closer to one half with many of these enterprises
virtually bankrupt.
The key element of the new reforms is a system to enable state assets to be
evaluated and then sold. State-owned investment companies, holding companies
or asset management companies will become shareholders and authorised to
sell a portion of an enterprise's assets. Initially, the government will
select pilot enterprises for the reforms. About 100 enterprises have been
earmarked for the programme.
The measures are also aimed at streamlining bankruptcy procedures to enable
hopeless cases to be liquidated or sold off. This will be done under the new
bankruptcy law.
The six-point plans also calls for establishment of an 'effective' social
security net to cover pensions and unemployment insurance. China's social
welfare provisions are rudimentary, or non-existent.
Eighteen Chinese cities, including Shanghai, Shenyang and Tianjin have been
included in the pilot programme.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Papua New Guinea, the resource-rich but economically troubled Pacific
nation, is to float its currency, the kina, from next Monday. It will be the
first time the currency has floated since the country gained independence in
1975.
The decision, announced yesterday by Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan, follows
a 12 per cent devaluation in the kina less than a month ago. 'At that time,
the government was hopeful this devaluation would stop speculation and allow
the kina to settle at a fair market rate,' the prime minister said.
'Unfortunately, since Sept 11, there has been further speculation,
culminating in recent days in a major attack on the kina ..The government
has decided it is no longer willing to pit the international reserves of the
country against the seemingly unstoppable urge of international speculators
to drive the currency lower.'
Papua New Guinea's foreign exchange market closed with immediate effect
yesterday and will not reopen until Monday. Local banks will provide limited
foreign exchange for emergency purposes. From October 10, the kina's value
will be set by five commercial banks, with the Bank of Papua New Guinea
continuing to play a supervisory role.
Sir Julius, describing the decision to float the currency as the most
important since independence, acknowledged there could be short-term
inflationary implications, causing wage pressures to mount in the medium
term.
'Shortly after the float takes place, the country's finance minister will
issue a statement setting government wages policy for public-sector
employees,' the prime minister added.
Papua New Guinea's problems had been mounting under the previous government,
headed by Mr Paias Wingti. The government deficit had been rising
alarmingly. New mining and petroleum projects at Porgera and Kutubu provided
extra revenue in the early 1990s, but their contributions are beginning to
ease off.
Earlier this year, Mr Masket Iangalio, the former finance minister, warned
PNG could be headed for bankruptcy if remedial action were not taken. He
handed down a 'mini-budget' last March, in an effort to redress the problem.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Japanese salarymen's earnings fall by 0.6%: First decline in
private sector pay for 44 years

Figures released by Japan's National Tax Administration yesterday showed
that private sector employees' earnings fell by 0.6 per cent in 1993 from
the previous year, the first fall in average pay since records began 44
years ago.
Average annual salary was Y4.52m (Pounds 29,296), down by Y28,000 compared
with 1992. Sharp cuts in the sizeable bi-annual bonuses paid to employees,
which can amount to 30 per cent of annual salary, were the main cause of the
decline. Basic salaries increased by 0.2 per cent on the 1992 figure, but
average bonus payments dropped by 3.7 per cent.
The long recession that began in 1990 has thus finally taken its toll on
employee salaries. In the boom years of economic growth in the 1960s and
1970s, double-digit annual percentage increases in pay were the norm.
After a brief deceleration in the early 1980s, salaries soared again during
the so-called 'bubble economy' at the end of the decade, when asset prices
and company profits jumped. In the last four years, the fall-out from the
'bubble' period has led to a collapse in corporate profitability, but until
last year companies had maintained regular salary increases.
With price inflation at just below zero, the decline in nominal pay
translates into a slightly smaller decline in real terms. But both figures
offer a stark illustration of the deflationary forces at work in the
economy. Faced with falling prices, companies are being forced to cut pay,
heightening the danger of a downward deflationary spiral.
While the hard-pressed sal-aryman adjusts to unprecedented austerity, female
Japanese employees last year recorded a slight advance. Average women's
salaries rose 0.8 per cent, while men's fell by 0.5 per cent.
The gender gap is unlikely to be closed soon. The figures showed women
earned an average Y2.7m. The highest paid employees (both male and female)
were once again in the financial sector, where earnings were an average
Y5.5m.
Total income tax paid represented 6.5 per cent of total earnings, low by
international standards but close to an all-time high for the Japanese, who
have long enjoyed the luxury of a low tax base. During the next few years,
the figure will decline again as substantial reductions in income tax take
effect.
In spite of the decline in gross salaries, the low tax take leaves the
average Japanese employee with one of the highest take-home pay-cheques in
the world, more than twice that of his British counterpart.
But the fact that Japanese prices are on average at least 60 per cent higher
than in any other industrialised country means real purchasing power is
little better.
