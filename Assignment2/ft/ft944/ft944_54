The Swiss parliament has approved measures to make it easier for foreigners
to buy and sell property in the country. Right-wing opponents have promised
to try to force a referendum on the issue. They have 90 days to raise the
required 50,000 signatures and their chances are considered good. Changes to
the so-called Lex Friedrich would enlarge the quota of holiday homes that
can be sold to foreigners from 1,420 per year to 4,000 every two years and
eliminate curbs on foreign residents buying property for their own use.
Foreign-owned companies would be free to buy property for their business but
property purchases for investment would remain restricted. Distress sales,
or sales by one foreigner to another, would no longer be counted against the
quota. The reform would probably come into effect next March if no
referendum were required.

<TEXT>
Norway's minority Labour government yesterday unveiled a draft 1995 budget
which aims to slash the deficit and forecasts continuing improvement in the
economy. It also shows optimism about winning the support of a sceptical
electorate in a referendum on November 28 on joining the European Union. The
draft reduces the deficit to NKr20.9bn (Pounds 1.95bn) from NKr32.7bn
(Pounds 3.05bn), helped by an increase in petroleum earnings to be derived
from a sharp rise in daily oil output to 2.6m barrels and a reduction in the
state's direct investment in the sector. The deficit reduction would also be
helped by an increase in a wide range of tariffs and taxes to raise
NKr4.6bn. However, Norway's dependence on oil is underlined by the non-oil
budget deficit of NKr52.6bn, against NKr58.2bn in 1994. Gross domestic
product is expected to grow by 2.75 per, down from 4.5 per cent this year.
Inflation is forecast to rise to 1.5 per cent from 1.25 per cent. Local
analysts said the government's prognosis for the non-oil, mainland economy
seems to assume a Yes vote in the EU referendum to substantiate forecast
growth of 12 per cent in corporate mainland investment next year (up from 7
per cent in 1994), amid warnings about investment from the country's biggest
companies if membership is rejected.

<TEXT>
The International Maritime Organisation, an arm of the United Nations,
yesterday announced plans to establish a panel of safety experts to
recommend action following the sinking in the Baltic last Wednesday of the
car ferry Estonia with the loss of more than 900 lives. The proposal by
IMO's secretary-general, Mr William O'Neil, is unprecedented in the
organisation's 35-year history and is intended to shorten its frequently
lengthy procedures. Even so, a final decision to go ahead with the panel
will not be taken until its safety committee meets in two months. The panel
would be headed by Mr Giuliano Pattofatto, an Italian naval architect and
chairman of the IMO's safety committee. It would consist of representatives
of member governments and outside experts and would be likely to present its
recommendations next May. The UK department of transport's marine safety
agency said it would ask its surveyors to check the bow doors of all ro-ro
passenger ferries operating out of UK ports.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Belgrade will reopen its airport to international flights today after a
28-month closure following a United Nations report confirming that Serbia's
President Slobodan Milosovic has cut off all military aid and supplies to
the Bosnian Serbs. The report, prepared by a UN monitoring team on the
Bosnian border with what remains of Yugoslavia, clears the way for
international flights and ferry services from Serbia and Montenegro and also
sporting and cultural exchanges. The sanctions will be suspended under a
100-day moratorium and come as a reward to Mr Milosovic for cutting links
with his former proteges, the Bosnian Serbs, in an attempt to force them
into accepting the so-called contact group's pleace plan. Jubilant airport
officials in Belgrade said the Russian carrier Aeroflot would make the first
international landing when it brings Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's deputy
foreign minister, from Moscow today - Russia has traditionally been Serbia's
closest ally. The Yugoslav national carrier, JAT, will resume flights
tomorrow, and a ferry service will re-start from Bar in Montenegro to Bari
in Italy. Other international carriers are expected to follow soon. Other
sanctions, such as the ban on nearly all foreign trade and the freezing of
foreign bank accounts, will remain in force, and diplomats in Belgrade say
they are unlikely to be lifted until Mr Milosovic accepts international
recognition of Croatia and Bosnia.
EU foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg yesterday reaffirmed the
commitment to tightening the exclusion zones, and their willingness to use
air strikes. They also discussed how to increase the presence of the
monitoring force along the border with the Bosnian Serbs. British
intelligence has reported its satisfaction that the border has been sealed
for six weeks. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said it was still
important to improve the fragile situation around Sarajevo.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Yeltsin promises to speed up economic reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday committed his government to a faster pace
of economic reform in Russia and to further measures, including tax changes,
aimed at attracting foreign investment.
Speaking to the press one year after he quelled an armed rebellion by
members of the Supreme Soviet, Mr Yeltsin underlined that Russia now
understood that success depended on its own resources. Nothing, he said,
would deflect the government, from reform.
The president:
Promised there would be no changes in 'key' figures in the government,
although he left the door open for members of opposition parties, including
communists, to join the cabinet, and said there could be changes in his
advisers.
Declared himself against a postponement of presidential elections, although
some of his closest allies have floated the idea in both parliamentary and
presidential elections.
Claimed the country was stable 'socially, politically and in inter-ethnic
relations', and dismissed a presidential bid from Mr Alexander Rutskoi,
former vice-president and a possible nationalist/communist opposition
candidate.
Said the economy had improved strongly since spring, with inflation down to
4 per cent, and savings on the rise. 'We will bring down inflation further.
We want to reduce mass unemployment. We have decided to strengthen reforms,
not to weaken them.'
None of the relatively few, prepared questions drew from the president any
concern about the rising inflation rate or the rapid fall of the rouble -
which dropped a further 25 points yesterday to stand at 2,668 to the dollar.
He stonewalled on a question on inter-enterprise debts, which run into many
thousands of billions of roubles and loom as the largest domestic problem,
and said nothing about Russia's call for extra loans from the International
Monetary Fund.
Included in the 40 draft laws Mr Yeltsin said he would put to parliament
will be proposals to make investment easier and to lower taxes on investors.
'A favourable investment climate must be created for Russian and foreign
businessmen,' he said. 'A modern investment infrastructure must be created.
There is a need for tax reform, and tax legislation should be drawn up.'
Mr Yeltsin said Russia was a 'great power' and that his recent trip to the
US and the UK had established a recognition that it was not acting in a
'neo-imperialist manner' but that it had legitimate concerns about the civil
rights of Russians living in the former Soviet states.

Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, yesterday revived the idea of a
Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.8bn) fund to stabilise the Russian rouble, writes
Peter Norman in Madrid. Speaking at the IMF-World Bank annual meeting, he
made mobilisation of the fund dependent on Russia pegging the rouble on the
foreign exchange market in the context of a strong economic reform
programme. Observers speculated that his remarks were designed to inject
some confidence into the rouble. The west offered Russia a rouble fund last
year but Moscow has so far failed to meet the conditions for it to operate.

Swiss retail sales turned up in August, recording a 2.3 per cent value
growth year-on-year after a 2 per cent decline in July. Private consumption
up to now has been the weakest component in the recovery that has been under
way in the Swiss economy since the fourth quarter of last year, in spite of
indications of improving consumer sentiment. Sales of food and luxury items
rose 3.5 per cent in August while clothing and textile sales declined by 3.4
per cent, the federal statistics office said. On a volume basis, August
sales were up by 2 per cent. Ian Rodger, Zurich
Italian prices rose by 0.3 per cent last month, giving an annual inflation
rate of 3.9 per cent, the national statistics office reported. In August,
prices were up 0.2 per cent.
The Dutch trade surplus shrank to Fl 1bn (Pounds 365m) in June from Fl 2.2bn
in May and Fl 1.9bn in June 1993, according to the central statistical
office. But for the first six months taken together, the surplus rose
sharply to Fl 10.2bn from Fl 8.8bn a year earlier.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Eko Stahl sale to Belgians faces aid probe

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German economics ministry and the Treuhand privatisation agency have
agreed to sell the last of east Germany's steel mills to Cockerill Sambre,
the Belgian steel producer, in a deal likely to meet resistance from the
European Commission.
The privatisation of Eko Stahl, one of the few remaining large industrial
complexes to be sold, will be referred to Brussels after the Treuhand board
agrees to the privatisation contract next Friday. The Commission has already
questioned, but not prevented, part of the DM1.3bn (Pounds 530m) subsidies
which the Treuhand has granted to Eko Stahl since 1990.
Mr Gunther Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, yesterday said he expected
'bitter resistance' from Brussels to the sale, particularly since Cockerill
is seeking substantial state and federal grants for its investment
commitment of more than DM530m in Eko Stahl.
A further investment package of DM770m will be provided, with the federal
government and the state of Brandenburg, where Eko Stahl is located, each
providing DM150m and the Treuhand DM470m. Cockerill will pay DM30m for a 60
per cent stake, with an option on the remaining 40 per cent which will be
held by the Treuhand.
In an attempt to win support for Cockerill's plans in Brussels, Mr Rexrodt
said he had already begun talks with Riva, the privately-owned Italian steel
producer, to reduce capacity in its plants in eastern Germany. Riva had been
the front-runner to buy Eko Stahl until it unexpectedly withdrew its offer
last May.
Mr Rexrodt added that he also expected resistance from British Steel, but
said such objections were unwarranted since British Steel received DM27bn in
subsidies in the early 1980s before it was sold.
A Cockerill spokesman said the investments would be used to re-build a blast
furnace and build a hot-rolling mill with the aim of establishing an
intergrated steel mill in the region. But Germany's Steel Federation
yesterday said there was only room for a cold-rolling mill at Eko Stahl,
adding that there was already an excess of hot-rolling capacity in the EU.
Cockerill, which already has a small steel mill and a steel services
division in eastern Germany, said it was anxious to 'gain a greater foothold
in the German market as well as eventually tap the markets in eastern
Europe'.
The sale of Eko Stahl, which last year had a turnover of DM1bn on annual
losses of DM150m, follows several attempts by the Treuhand to find a buyer
for the mill, which is located in Eisenhuttenstadt, one of the more
depressed regions in eastern Germany.
The Treuhand, backed by Bonn, opted, for political and social reasons, to
keep Eko Stahl open despite overcapacity in the German steel industry. The
mill, which employed more than 12,300 people before German unification and
produced 2.2m tonnes of steel, has since reduced the workforce to under
3,000 and its capacity to under 1m tonnes.

Official proceedings have been started against one of Spain's most
successful and glamorous bullfighters - over a bull he did not kill. Jesuln
de Ubrique could be fined up to Pta10m (Pounds 50,000) and banned for six
months for refusing to deliver the death-blow during a corrida last month in
the southeastern town of Albacete. And that, in the strange world of
bullfighting, is definitely against the rules. Occasionally a bull that has
fought particularly bravely may be spared, at the discretion of the
president of the fight. But Jesulin de Ubrique broke all the codes by taking
the decision himself. It was his 122nd meeting of the season, breaking a
record set by the flamboyant Manuel Benitez, El Cordobes. By allowing his
first bull of the afternoon to leave the ring alive, he wanted to make a
gesture to his famous predecessor. The bull in question, ironically, was
called Executioner. The president of the event, a police official as often
happens, took the matter seriously and reported it. The case is now in the
hands of the civil governor's office.

FT  05 OCT 94 / German Elections: SPD rivals form a troika to beat Kohl -
Teaming up has halted the slump in the party's fortunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may yet prove to have been the best thing Rudolf Scharping did in his
long, hard campaign to defeat Helmut Kohl and become the next German
chancellor. At the end of the summer, with his popularity slipping, and his
Social Democratic party falling ever further behind in the polls, the SPD
leader swallowed his pride, abandoned hope of challenging the chancellor on
his own, and summoned his two arch-rivals in the party to help.
Oskar Lafontaine, the impish and irrepressible premier of the Saarland, on
the Franco-German frontier, was already in the campaign team, but not in the
front line. Gerhard Schroder, the smooth-talking and ambitious premier of
Lower Saxony, was sulking in his capital of Hanover, making little secret of
his intention to stay there until the election was lost.
All three men, known as the 'grandsons' of the late Mr Willy Brandt, the SPD
chancellor, openly competed to inherit the mantle of party leadership and
continued to disagree on the best way of unseating Mr Kohl and his Christian
Democratic Union.
Today the three are operating as a team. This has breathed new life into a
flagging campaign and with less than two weeks to polling day, the result is
still wide open.
It was a day in mid-August, after another gloomy meeting of the party's
national executive in Bonn, that Mr Scharping took Mr Schroder to one side
and made him an offer he could not refuse. He would give him a
super-ministry - industry, transport and energy all rolled into one - in the
future federal government, if he would come back into the fight, Mr
Scharping said. And it would be three against one - Scharping, Schroder and
Lafontaine against the immovable Kohl, he promised.
It took Mr Schroder just a couple of days to decide, with a little help from
Mr Lafontaine. It was time the three dedicated rivals, all career
politicians since their days as Young Socialist leaders in the early 1970s,
buried their differences and came to the aid of the party, he said.
Within days, the SPD head office was rushing out 150,000 copies of a new
election poster: the grinning threesome shoulder-to-shoulder, with a
one-word caption, Stark (Strong). It is a simple message, but ever since
then, the slump in the SPD's fortunes seems to have stopped. Mr Kohl, whose
own campaign poster has no words on it at all, has at last got a fight on
his hands.
Last week the SPD troika came together on a platform in Frankfurt's
Romerberg, outside the medieval town hall, to demonstrate their new-found
solidarity.
They still strike a pretty strange contrast side-by-side. Tall and austere,
the bearded Mr Scharping stands with his arms sternly folded across his
chest, a fixed smile on his face. He never seems able entirely to relax,
gearing himself up for the next encounter. He lectures the crowds like a
headmaster, full of moral duty, facts and figures.
Mr Schroder is quite the opposite. Deliberately casual in smart,
double-breasted suits and pastel-coloured shirt, he sticks his hands in his
pockets, and chats easily with the crowd. He delights in hecklers from the
back row, speaks off the cuff, and obviously revels in the television
lights.
Mr Lafontaine is different again. Short and plump, he's a punchy, aggressive
orator, the best the party has got, mixing wisecracks with political
punch-lines. His one weakness is that he cannot forget his own defeat at the
last election, when he was the chancellor-candidate, and misread the mood of
the electorate in favour of unification. He still spends too much time
justifying his insistence that unification would cost too much - and
denouncing Mr Kohl for pretending that it could be paid for without
increased taxation.
Their messages at least are complementary. Mr Schroder hammers home his
record as a saviour of jobs in Lower Saxony, where he has openly pumped
public funds into loss-making enterprises, such as Deutsche Aerospace's
Lemwerder plant, to keep the workers busy. 'It is far better to save jobs
than pay unemployment benefit,' he insists. It is what he plans to go on
doing if he gets that super-ministry.
Then it is Mr Lafontaine's turn to denounce the spendthrift ways of the
current coalition and demonstrate that his own tax plans are both fairer and
more responsible. Eighty per cent of taxpayers will pay less, he says, and
just 20 per cent will pay more, to bear the burden of unification which he
warned about before.
Both pledge their loyalty to the official chancellor-candidate, although few
doubt that each believes he could have done the job better. And then it is
up to Mr Scharping himself to give the crowd a vision of the fairer, more
prosperous world that the SPD can offer, with the promise of more jobs, at
no more expense.
He still finds it hard work to be exciting, preaching down from the pulpit,
following a text he appears to have learned by heart. But he can leave the
rhetorical flashes to his erstwhile rivals. His great achievement is that he
has bound them in to his election team. That means, if they win, they will
all share the credit. And if they lose, they will all share the blame.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Berlusconi urged to release report on Fininvest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Opposition politicians are pressing Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime
minister, to publish a report which he commissioned to resolve the conflict
of interest with his ownership of Fininvest, the country's second largest
private business group.
The report, commissioned by Mr Berlusconi when he took office in May, was
handed over to the prime minister on Thursday. Mr Berlusconi has so far
refused to comment on its contents, fuelling suggestions that he does not
accept the conclusions.
Mr Cesare Salvi, head of the Progressive grouping of senators, the main
opposition in the upper house, has called for urgent distribution of the
report to parliament.
Other politicians have urged action from President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who
encouraged the idea of a special commission.
The conflict of interest issue has come increasingly to the fore as the
right-wing coalition extends its control over the Rai, the state
broadcasting organisation, while Mr Berlusconi still retains ownership of
Fininvest that dominates 80 per cent of commercial television with its three
national channels.
When Mr Berlusconi entered politics in January, he merely distanced himself
from daily management of Fininvest. The company recorded a L11,600bn (Pounds
4.72bn) turnover in 1993, with debts of L3,900bn. Since becoming prime
minister he had been made fully aware of the problems but appears reluctant
to lose the ownership or see Fininvest broken up.
At first he sought to involve President Scalfaro as a special guarantor to
monitor potential conflicts of interests. But the president ruled this out
as unconstitutional. Mr Berlusconi then opted for a three-man commission of
legal experts with an open brief.
Having personally selected the three members, it will not be easy to reject
their conclusions. The commission is composed of legal experts, including Mr
Agostino Gambino, a law professor who has done work for Fininvest.
Those close to the commission argue it is almost impossible to employ the US
model of a blind trust to Fininvest. Such a trust functions where assets
have already been sold and then invested by trustees with the owner being
'blind' to the nature of the fiduciary investments.
Suggestions that Fininvest ownership be placed in trust in the names of his
five children have not found favour with Mr Berlusconi because of tax
problems the children might incur. Opposition politicians are wary of this
solution because they believe he would not be sufficiently distanced from
his empire - which he has every intention of returning to once his political
venture ends.
The once clear-cut solution - a quick disposal of Fininvest assets - is
virtually impossible. This would call into question the entire nature of
television ownership in Italy, raise anti-trust issues in publishing and
open a debate on foreign investment in the media.
But until a solution is found, Mr Berlusconi risks constant conflicts of
interest, the most serious being over the government's control of the Rai.
Others are more insidious. Last week for instance, in announcing the budget,
he encouraged people to switch to private pension funds - Fininvest's
Mediolanum financial services are promoting private pension funds.
Yesterday it emerged his authority was used to curb the sexual content of
American television serials shown on Fininvest channels. His wife, Veronica,
had apparently urged action after being contacted by a pro-Vatican
journalist.
The Fininvest programmes showing what the Italian press has dubbed 'soap
erotica' are now being sanitised or shown at different hours.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Net tightens round French Republicans: Corruption probes are
not only ensnaring the party but could harm the premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strand by strand, the web of corruption probes ensnaring Mr Gerard Longuet,
the French industry minister, and his Republican party, is growing thicker.
An announcement by the justice ministry on Monday night that it was opening
a formal investigation into the funding of the centrist party follows
existing allegations of irregularities concerning payments for the
minister's holiday villa in Saint Tropez. He is already under pressure to
resign, and the latest probe could also drag other party members into the
judicial firing line.
The implications of Mr Longuet's legal problems, however, extend beyond his
position and his party. The affairs are developing into a dilemma for Mr
Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, which could undermine his bid for the
presidency in next spring's elections. More broadly, they are fuelling
pressures for a reform of the relationship between French business groups
and political parties.
For Mr Balladur, the stakes are high. With his eyes set on next year's
elections, he regards Mr Longuet and his Republicans as vital allies in an
undeclared battle with his Gaullist rival, Mr Jacques Chirac. The Republican
party is the largest element in the UDF, junior partner in the centre-right
RPR-UDF government, and could offset Mr Chirac's advantage as head of the
Gaullist RPR.
The widening scope of the corruption investigation also threatens to tarnish
Mr Balladur's government. In addition to Mr Longuet, two other ministers
from the Republican party - Mr Francois Leotard, defence minister, and Mr
Alain Madelin, minister for enterprises and economic development - were
cited in the report by an investigating magistrate which triggered Monday's
official inquiry.
The report, issued by Mr Reynaud Van Ruymbeke, the magistrate leading the
probe into the financing of Mr Longuet's villa, questions how the Republican
party received cash payments of about FFr28m (Pounds 3.35m) between 1987 and
1991. It also questions whether the party obtained its Paris headquarters on
favourable terms.
Mr Leotard and Mr Madelin, like Mr Longuet, strongly deny any wrongdoing and
attack the leaking of supposedly confidential investigations. 'Journalists
are becoming prosecutors,' said Mr Leotard. The problem for Mr Balladur,
however, is that the corruption controversies could damage the image of his
government as they did the previous Socialist administration which was
bundled from office last year, partly because of a public perception of
corruption.
Mr Balladur's government has already lost one minister in a corruption case.
Mr Alain Carignon, the communications minister, stepped down in July after
being placed under investigation for alleged influence peddling in Grenoble,
where he is mayor. Several leading businessmen, including the chairmen of
Saint Gobain, the glass and building materials company, and Cogedim, the
property developer, have also been placed under investigation for alleged
fraud.
The combined effect of the various corruption investigations has been to
increase pressure for a reform of the existing party financing laws and the
close links between business and politics. Mr Philippe Seguin, the national
assembly president, proposes an all-party study into reforming legislation
on the funding of political parties, a move which would have the backing of
90 per cent of the public, according to a Louis Harris poll published on
Monday.
France has already implemented several reforms of party financing over the
past six years. Laws passed in 1988 and 1990 limited the campaign spending
of parliamentary candidates to FFr500,000 (Pounds 60,000) and set limits on
corporate contributions. There is now pressure, however, for a complete ban
on corporate funding.
Two senior government politicians, Mr Pierre Mazeaud and Mr Charles Millon,
have proposed a bill to ban completely the financing of political campaigns
by business groups. Alternatives include a state fund for political
expenditure or the creation of German-style foundations to receive corporate
contributions and so act as a filter between politicians and companies.
Mr Balladur, however, has been reluctant to embark on complex and
politically sensitive reforms. He argues that the rise in corruption
investigations in recent months reflects a freer hand given to judicial
authorities rather than a rise in corruption and that the cases in question
date back to the end of the 1980s. He says he is 'convinced that a rigorous
application of the law will clean up the situation'.
Mr Balladur may be right. But, politically, it is a risky perspective. The
prime minister has already drawn criticism for granting Mr Longuet a one
month grace period to defend himself against Mr Van Ruymbeke's allegations
of irregularities concerning his villa, although he has made it clear he
expects the minister to resign if formally charged.
Said one senior Chirac supporter: 'Mr Candidate has got the better of Dr
Premier.'

FT  05 OCT 94 / Hungary acts to accelerate privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hungary's new Socialist-led government has sacked eight of the 10 board
members of AV Rt, the state holding company, and is investigating its
general manager for alleged corruption as part of a wide-ranging shake-up of
privatisation.
It has appointed four new board members and an acting president to oversee
the AV Rt until a replacement for Mr Lajos Csepi as general manager is
found. It is investigating charges that Mr Csepi misused funds, forged
documents and abused his position.
Mr Csepi became head of the AV Rt shortly after it was set up in 1992 to
manage the 160 companies in which the state wished to sell strategic stakes
but retain majority ownership.
The government said the move was one of several designed to speed up
privatisation and to restore public confidence in the process in the wake of
several corruption scandals. In future, the state would place more emphasis
on privatising companies via cash sales, flotation on the stock market and
through sales to institutional investors, officials said.
Until now trade sales to strategic partners, often through tender, have been
Hungary's preferred privatisation method. However, investors have complained
of influence-trafficking and long bureaucratic delays in privatisation
negotiations. The government has already begun an investigation into
privatisation under the previous administration and, in particular, the 320
companies sold off between April and June just before the change of
government. Hungarian police said yesterday they would continue their
clampdown on illegal immigrants despite protests from foreign embassies and
business groups in Budapest. The police said they would use powers granted
in a law which came into effect this month to enter private homes to check
up on foreigners. The statement came after a month-long series of raids on
restaurants, hotels and other night spots frequented by foreigners. More
than 100,000 people, including 15,000 foreigners, had been checked since
September 9, the police said.
Western businessmen in Budapest said the raids were counter-productive and
would hurt the government's drive to attract more foreign investment.
Foreign companies have complained about new immigration rules which require
expatriates working in Hungary to apply for three permits and to be tested
for the HIV virus.

FT  05 OCT 94 / UK joins European airlines to fight aid for Air France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government and seven European airlines mounted a concerted
challenge yesterday to the European Commission's decision to allow the
French government to grant FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) in fresh subsidies to Air
France.
In three separate filings at the European Court of Justice, the UK
government, British Midland Airways, and another group of six European
airlines led by British Airways are seeking to annul EU approval of the
latest state aid for the French national carrier.
The moves are expected to sharpen the controversy over government support
for European state-owned carriers while the EU is trying to encourage
greater competition in a liberalised European aviation market.
The UK government said the EU's decision to allow the latest subsidies to
Air France, one of the three largest airlines in Europe, would 'distort
competition' and undermine the benefits of the European single aviation
market.
Mr Brian Mawhinney, the UK transport secretary, said: 'The Commission
decision ignores the need for evenhanded treatment. It removes the incentive
for state-owned airlines to become efficient and to adopt a sound commercial
approach.'
British Midland described the Air France aid as 'grotesque' and 'almost
equal to the entire losses made by all the world's airlines in 1993'.
BA has been joined in its action by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian
Airlines System, Air UK, Maersk Air of Denmark, and TAT, the French regional
carrier which is 49 per cent owned by BA.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, said: 'Approving Air France's package of
state aid was a deplorable decision which cannot be allowed to go
unchallenged.'
Sir Colin argued that there was no justification for such a large subsidy
for Air France. He said the conditions imposed by the EU for granting the
aid were 'wholly inadequate' and it risked serious damage to the development
of a free aviation market in Europe.
BA and several other European carriers, which have been forced to rely
essentially on their own efforts to restructure their activities, now fear
that a two-class airline industry is emerging in Europe: the first involving
airlines that have had to solve their problems on their own; the second
including airlines that continued to rely on their governments for support.
Since August 1991, Brussels has approved state aid to airlines totalling
Dollars 10.35bn (Pounds 6.6bn), with the Commission approving in July alone
aid amounting to Dollars 7.1bn to three airlines: Air France, Olympic
Airways of Greece and TAP Air Portugal.
The UK government yesterday said the Air France aid, spread over three
years, was the largest ever allowed in the European air transport industry.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Blair signals end to public ownership commitment: Labour's
new leader reinforces historic shift to centre ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair pledged yesterday to rewrite Labour's constitutional
commitment to public ownership, using his conference debut as party leader
to underscore a historic shift towards the political centre ground.
His surprise decision to signal at the Blackpool conference an end to the
party's 75-year attachment to Clause 4 of its constitution came in a speech
which redefined Labour's economic and social ambitions.
The move, backed by his more traditionalist deputy, Mr John Prescott,
represented a calculated effort by Mr Blair to persuade the voters that his
leadership foreshadows an irreversible shift in the party's policies.
Clause 4, committing the party to 'common ownership of the means of
production, distribution and exchange' has been a symbol of Labour's
socialism since it was first stamped on membership cards in 1918.
It was last challenged - unsuccessfully - by the then Labour leader Mr Hugh
Gaitskell after the party's election defeat in 1959. But Mr Blair said
Labour now needed a 'clear, up-to-date' statement of its objectives.
In a confident, uncompromising performance which won warm applause from his
audience but later drew sniping from some on the party's hard left, Mr Blair
said the party had no alternative but to change.
'We have changed and we were right to change,' he said. 'Parties that don't
change die and this party is a living movement, not an historical monument.'
Directing his speech at a far wider audience than the 4,000 delegates and
supporters in Blackpool's Empress Ballroom, Mr Blair embraced the market
economy, underlined his support for the family and reassured the middle
classes that Labour had abandoned its high tax and spending policies. There
would be no wholesale repeal of the government's trades union laws and a
tough stance on rising crime.
In spite of earlier disputes at the conference over taxation, he insisted:
'To middle and lower income Britain facing the biggest tax rise in peacetime
history - Labour is on your side.' Casting Labour as the party of the
majority rather than the 'privileged few', he launched a fierce attack on
the Tories for their 'incompetence' and dogmatic attachment to unfettered
market forces.
Labour's ambitions for a partnership between public and private sectors
would foster individual opportunity: 'We are the mainstream voice in British
politics today - Labour back to speak up for Britain, Labour back as the
people's party.' Mr Blair said Labour's strategy would be built on the four
pillars of opportunity, responsibility, fairness and trust. But it would
include a new realism in which the party would promise the electorate only
what it could deliver.
Mr Blair appeared confident after his speech that his plan for a new
statement of the party's ambitions - which he will present to the National
Executive before Christmas - would be carried at next year's conference.
But leading leftwingers indicated their determination to campaign to
preserve Clause 4.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Tighter checks on insider dealing proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stock Exchange proposed yesterday that trading in individual companies'
shares should be suspended if there is evidence that price-sensitive
information concerning those companies has been leaked.
The controversial measure is part of its campaign to minimise the effects of
insider trading on investors' confidence in the market.
The scheme is the brainchild of Mr Michael Lawrence, the exchange's new
chief executive. It was prompted by his concern last May at the four-day
delay between a surge in the share price of Portals, the maker of banknote
paper, and the company's announcement that it had received a takeover
approach.
In that period, 854,000 Portals shares worth Pounds 5.7m were traded at
prices around 666p. However, after Portals announced the takeover talks, the
shares surged to a high of 805p, so anyone who had sold in the preceding
days had missed more than 100p per share of profit.
Yesterday's exchange document also contains a tentative suggestion that it
should be able to force stockbroking firms to 'reverse' or cancel share
transactions when it believes they have been 'carried out with the benefit
of unpublished price-sensitive information'.
The exchange said: 'This would serve as a strong deterrent, as the gain from
such illicit transactions would be lost.'
However, Mr Lawrence is concerned that he might be accused by the government
of attempting to introduce civil sanctions against insider trading by the
back door.
In relation to the planned system of suspending shares after a leak, Mr
Lawrence said: 'I hope it all can be implemented.' He acknowledged that it
might initially meet opposition, because it appeared to fly in the face of
the longstanding exchange tradition that continuous trading in shares should
be maintained at all costs.
However, he said he was determined to make the market a fairer place, where
those without access to unpublished price-sensitive information were not
severely disadvantaged.
He said: 'I believe the proposal to suspend individual shares in this way
will increase confidence in the market as a whole.'
The proposals have been made possible by the development last year of the
exchange's computerised Integrated Monitoring and Surveillance System, used
to detect unusual price movements or anomalous transactions.
Under the proposed arrangements, parameters would be set for 'normal' price
fluctuations in the shares of every company. If a share price moved outside
that band, a warning would automatically be flashed to market participants
on the Seaq trading system.
At the same time, market makers, the wholesalers of shares, would be
absolved of their obligation to deal at the price shown on the Seaq screen.

FT  05 OCT 94 / Lloyd's Names win battle against Gooda Agency: Court ruling
gives 3,000 members prospect of record Pounds 504m compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hard-hit members of Lloyd's of London won a significant victory yesterday
when the High Court held out the prospect of record compensation for losses
incurred as a result of 'culpable' and 'unjustified' risks taken by the
now-defunct Gooda Walker agency.
The Gooda Walker action group, representing 3,096 Names, individuals whose
assets have traditionally supported the insurance market, claimed
compensation should total at least Pounds 504m. This would be more than
double the previous largest award by an English court.
But the figure was swiftly disputed by lawyers representing the insurers of
the 71 Lloyd's agencies defending the case - out of whose funds any
compensation will be paid.
The judgment provided encouragement for other groups of Names taking legal
action against Lloyd's agencies - particularly those involved in similar
'spiral' insurance, by which underwriters agree to cover others against
excessive losses from catastrophes.
In the judgment, Mr Justice Phillips said the spiral was 'like a multiple
game of pass the parcel'. Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the action group,
which had claimed Pounds 629m in compensation for its Names, said: 'The
parcel turned out to be a time-bomb that exploded in our faces.'
Compensation was ordered for losses incurred as a result of five
catastrophes - including the Piper Alpha North Sea oil rig disaster in 1988
and the 1989 Caribbean Hurricane Hugo. The verdict also offered some
protection against losses resulting from the catastrophes but not yet
reported.
The scale of the compensation awarded and the prospect of further legal
victories by Lloyd's Names will add to the pressure for the insurance market
to make a fresh attempt to reach an overall settlement for all outstanding
claims, which could total in excess of Pounds 3bn.
Mr Val Powell, chief executive of the Association of Lloyd's Members, said
last night that 'the decisive result achieved by the Gooda Walker Action
Group should make it clear that the defendants of this and other spiral
cases can expect no advantage from resisting Names' claims further in
court'.
A spokesman for Lloyd's said it 'would do anything we can to help' a
settlement but the initiative had to come from the defendants. Last night,
however, lawyers representing the 'errors and omissions' insurers, which
provide Lloyd's agencies with cover against negligence claims, hinted they
may appeal against yesterday's decision. The result of any appeal is
unlikely to be reached before next summer. The insurers are certain to
dispute the level of compensation in court.
The insurers' solicitors, Clyde and Co, said said some of the agencies sued
successfully are in liquidation: 'Others may follow. Many have no or
insufficient insurance cover to respond to awards of damages now likely.'
The action group conceded that the 'errors and omissions' cover of the
agencies they sued would be insufficient to meet their claim.
In his judgment, the judge said the principal negligence by Gooda Walker was
the failure of its underwriters to arrange sufficient reinsurance to cover
the risks to which they were exposing Names. He also criticised other
aspects of their work, including poor monitoring of risks assumed by
syndicates.
The judge said Names should only be compensated for losses that were a
result of the failure to provide enough reinsurance.

<TEXT>
Japanese textile associations have asked the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry to curb a flood of cheap textile imports battering the domestic
industry. The Japan Spinners' Association and Japan Cotton and Staple Fibre
Weavers' Association asked Miti to cut imports under the Multi-Fibre
Arrangement (MFA), an international agreement which lets nations impose
restrictions if surging imports cause confusion in the market. Japan is
working out detailed guidelines for the application of the MFA. Both
associations asked for a curb on imports of poplin and broad textiles from
China and Indonesia, used to make sheets and shirts, while the spinners also
asked for restraint in 20-count cotton yarn imports from China, Indonesia
and South Korea. The yarn is used to make poplin and broad cloth.
Last week, China's commercial counsellor in Tokyo was quoted as saying that
China might retaliate if Japan imposed unilateral restrictions on textile
imports.

trim deficit

<TEXT>
The depth of the 1992 crisis in the Finnish banking sector was highlighted
yesterday when Unitas, the country's second largest banking group, announced
heavier write-offs and another big loss for the first eight months of the
year.
The bank said its credit losses, at FM1.82bn (Dollars 374m), were FM137m
higher than in the same 1993 period.
It relied on lower interest rates, higher capital gains on equities and the
acquisition of part of the Savings Bank of Finland to achieve a 14 per cent
reduction in overall pre-tax losses, to FM870m from FM1.01bn.
Banks in Finland, Sweden and Norway were overwhelmed by losses in 1992 after
their economies fell into recession and real estate markets crashed.
However, while banks in Norway and Sweden have returned to profit, Finland's
leading banks warn they may not show black figures until 1996.
Finland's domestic economy is still struggling to emerge from a three-year
recession, in spite of a boom in the export sector.
Mr Markku Pohjola, Unitas executive vice-president, said: 'In Sweden, the
banking crisis was mainly related to the real estate market. In Finland, it
has more to do with small and medium-sized companies which have gone
bankrupt. The Finnish process has developed more gradually.'
A large part of Unitas' credit losses in the first eight months was caused
by the collapse of two groups - Haka, a construction concern, and Eka, a
retail and wholesale company.
Mr Pohjola said Unitas expected lower credit losses in the final four
months, and an overall pre-tax loss that was roughly half last year's
FM2.57bn. Next year the bank expects to break even before returning to the
black in 1996.
Non-performing loans totalled FM6.18bn at the end of August, down from
FM6.84bn at the end of last year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Azerbaijan's President Haydar Aliyev imposed a state of emergency yesterday
after interior ministry troops held the general prosecutor captive overnight
to demand the release of jailed colleagues, Reuter reports from Baku.
In a television address President Aliyev said the seizure of general
prosecutor Mr Ali Umarov by the special interior ministry police amounted to
a 'coup d'etat'.
'What has happened testifies to the fact that aggressive forces inside and
outside the country are still trying to destabilise the republic,' he said.
Mr Umarov was freed yesterday after being held by a 100-strong unit which
seized control of the building where he worked.
The president said the force demanded the resignation of the general
prosecutor and the interior minister. He rejected these demands.
Government troops then encircled the base to where the disgruntled units had
withdrawn after releasing Mr Umarov.
All telephone lines were cut between the capital Baku and Russia and other
former Soviet republics. Some satellite lines had also been shut down and
the main post office in the capital was closed. A night-time curfew was
expected to come into effect.
The state of emergency tightens regulations on entering and leaving the
country, imposes media censorship and bans demonstrations and strikes.
It also empowers the president to suspend the activities of political
parties seen as destabilising the country.
Witnesses reported that several tanks were patrolling Baku streets, guarding
government buildings and military installations.
News reports said government troops had briefly exchanged fire with the
interior ministry forces but there had been no casualties.

An Italian opposition leader has caused a political storm by conjuring up a
scenario in which Mr Silvio Berlusconi, prime minister, could be accused of
corruption, allowing the far right to replace him with a top magistrate,
Reuter reports from Rome. Mr Rocco Buttiglione, leader of the Popular party,
the former Christian Democrats, said on Sunday: 'Some people are saying that
there could be a judicial warning against the prime minister and a good
substitute would be (Mr Antonio) Di Pietro.' Magistrates issue judicial
warnings when formally announcing they suspect someone of having committed a
crime. Mr Di Pietro is Italy's leading anti-graft magistrate and spearhead
of the war on corruption which has swept away the political old guard.
Italy's corruption scandals have brushed perilously close to Mr Berlusconi.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (29): Short on speed and range
 -A look at prospects for the electric car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After 100 years of being 'just around the corner', the electric car is
coming into sight. But it is low on power, short of range, expensive to make
and is being pushed and pulled along by environmental legislators and
grumbling carmakers.
Were it not for Californian state clean-air legislation requiring 2 per cent
of each manufacturer's sales to be of zero-emission vehicles (Zevs) from
1998, it is unlikely that the battery-powered car - currently seen as the
only way of achieving zero emissions in urban areas - would be a candidate
for volume production this century, certainly in North America.
Americans pay little for petrol and the economic incentive towards electric
cars is zero. Even in Europe and Japan, where growing urban air quality
problems and much higher fuel prices create a more viable climate for 'EVs'
(electric vehicles), progress is slow and disappointing for their
proponents.
Despite intensive research and expenditure of many hundreds of millions of
dollars, the search for a 'superbattery' capable of giving an 'EV' anything
remotely like the speed and range of a petrol car has so far failed. There
are a few promising alternatives to lead-acid types, but most have
disadvantages.
Thus when the first flocks of battery cars do roll out of Californian
showrooms in less than four years, the certainty is that their high cost
will be subsidised in part by the conventional cars their manufacturers sell
in much larger numbers. And the drivers who have bought them will have made
knowing sacrifices of finance and flexibility as the price of cleaner Los
Angeles air - for range restrictions rule out EVs as 'only' cars for
far-ranging Americans.
But roll out the 'Zevs' will, except in the now-highly unlikely event of the
Californian Air Resources Board (Carb) and other state legislators being won
over, at the 11th hour, by the motor industry's fervent arguments that a
truly viable Zev is not technically achievable by 1998.
Such arguments have been falling on deaf Carb ears for the past several
years, and other states such as Massachusetts have been lining up to impose
similar legislation.
And the '2 per cent' rule is just the start; the legislation requires 10 per
cent of sales, or at least 100,000 in California's 1m-plus new car market,
to be of Zevs by early next century .
Manufacturers have had no choice but to start developing such cars, for the
threatened penalty of non-compliance is exclusion from California's and some
other states' markets.
Certainly the motor industry has little hope of a reprieve through the
still-rumbling debate about whether battery cars are really as clean as they
are made out to be.
As a number of reports in both the US and Europe have pointed out, the
electric power stored in an EV's battery has to be generated somehow. And
whether it is produced from coal, oil, natural gas, hydro or nuclear energy
will have a big effect on the overall environmental impact of a
battery-powered car population.
It is typical of the unfulfilled promise of even the biggest car makers'
electric vehicle plans that as far back as the early 1980s General Motors
was promising 100,000-plus output of small electric cars before the end of
that decade. They never materialised, defeated largely by inadequate battery
technology. Nor did promised vehicles from Ford.
Now GM has the Impact, perhaps the most-trumpeted electric car programme of
all, and trials of which are just getting under way in Los Angeles.
In 1991, GM's electric vehicle programme directors implied, if not
specifically stated, that cars based on the 100mph-plus, purpose-built and
aluminium-bodied Impact would be rolling out of a former Buick plant at
Lansing, Michigan, well before the 1998 deadline.
Even though a fleet of 30 has now been produced under a Dollars 32m
'PrEView' programme which will see 1,000 drivers evaluate cars and charging
apparatus over the next two years, the Impact project appears to have lost
GM's earlier go-it-alone enthusiasm. The world's biggest vehicle maker is
now collaborating with both Ford and Chrysler in pursuit of the viable EV.
One ray of hope on the battery front is a joint venture GM and several other
car makers, including Hyundai of Korea, have signed with the Ovonic battery
company of the US, to produce batteries using nickel-hydride.
In the case of the Impact, says GM, it is believed the Ovonic battery could
double the Impact's 70-mile city driving range using lead-acid bateries.
Even this project falls within a wider US collaborative framework. GM, Ford,
Chrysler, electric utilities and government agencies, formed several years
ago into the Advanced Battary Consortium, have awarded research and
development contracts to five other battery makers pursuing alternative
technologies.
The search for viable battery cars for California has already had its
casualties. At least one City of Los Angeles-backed electric car project has
run out of funds.
Meanwhile, Ford and several European companies are among those arguing that
ultra-low (but not zero) emissions 'hybrid' cars should be considered as an
effective compromoise. They would use a very small petrol or diesel engine
running at constant speed to keep batteries charged when running on open
highways (thus overcoming the range problem) but switching to battery-only
operation in urban areas.
That debate, too, rumbles on both in North America and in Europe, where
there is considerable interest in the activities of Peugeot, a lonely voice
predicting that Europe could have a 200,000-plus market for electric cars by
the end of the decade.
Peugeot says it plans soon to produce electric cars at an initial rate of
5,000 a year. And more than 20 French towns are being equipped with a basic
infrastructure to recharge them. The rest of Europe, far less reliant on
nuclear energy, appears content to stand and watch.
Just how much progress is really being made should become more evident in
California in December. It is then that an important electric vehicle
symposium will take place with Ford, Chrysler, BMW, Mercedes and all others
with a stake in the wealthy Californian market putting their EV wares on
display. The symposium will take place in Anaheim. . . more specifically, at
Disneyland. . .

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (28): Early sign of a change in
attitudes - Technology: European buyers are starting to demand more extras
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFF DANIELS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe is a motoring paradox for the systems engineer. European motorists,
as any engineer (and especially any Japanese engineer) will tell you, drive
faster, go round corners quicker and generally expect more in the way of
performance from their cars than anyone else.
Yet for the most part they have until now remained resolutely indifferent to
developments which make life at the wheel safer, more comfortable, and more
efficient.
The antithesis of the European is to be seen in the clogged streets of
Tokyo. Here the driver of a typical medium-sized car will edge his way along
with the aid of automatic transmission. The temperature and the humidity may
both be in the nineties but the Japanese driver will have air conditioning
to take care of that.
Every so often, he will glance at a display which tells him if he is still
heading in the right direction. And if the boredom of slow progress becomes
too much, he may switch the display from navigation mode and sing his way
along to the tones of his own in-car karaoke as the words of the song appear
on the same screen.
It may be that European drivers will forever place in-car karaoke lower on
their list of priorities - but don't laugh: the addition of such frivolities
gave a huge boost to the originally slow-starting sales of in-car navigation
systems in Japan. Many motor industry suppliers, and in particular the
larger component groups, are writing their plans around the assumption that
European drivers will begin to embrace technically advanced systems for
their own sake.
An early sign of this changing attitude was provided by the air-bag. Product
planners wise in the ways of Europeans had long predicted that the air-bag
would remain a largely American phenomenon, its extra cost stoutly resisted
on this side of the Atlantic by drivers who would continue to rely on the
efficiency of their tried, trusted and sensible safety belts. The planners
were wrong. The majority of cars on sale in Europe are now equipped at least
with a driver-side air-bag, and there is no question that the trend has been
consumer driven. Through 1993, there was what amounted to a panic among car
manufacturers to engineer installations and secure component supplies to
avoid being left behind in the rush.
The question now is which item of equipment will be the next to rise to the
top of the consumers' must-have list.
Some of the smart money has gone to back air conditioning systems. In
perhaps 10 years, air conditioning has moved in European eyes from being an
indulgence confined to the most luxurious of cars, to a remarkably efficient
aid to comfort which is now beginning to appear in the upper reaches of
mid-range family cars.
Significantly, as used to be the case with central locking (which is now
fitted to well over half of all the cars sold in Europe), those who have
tried it tend to insist that they could never again do without it.
Encouraged by such sentiments, the leading system suppliers such as Valeo
are gearing up for a rapid rise in demand, with the possibility of 50 per
cent of new European cars being air conditioned by the 1997 model year.
The debate meanwhile rages as to how eagerly European car buyers will
embrace the visible aspects of electronics - not the karaoke, but certainly
the navigation display, for example. The electronics are already there in
the car, of course: no modern low-emission engine could function without its
electronic management system, no anti-lock braking and traction control
system could operate with high efficiency without the speed and precision of
electronics.
Most automatic transmissions have abandoned hydro-mechanical for electronic
control; the new generation of 'active' chassis control systems, from
adaptive damping to Citroen's remarkable new Activa roll-limitation system,
depend on electronic sensing and control. The real arguments in this area
now centre around two questions: visibility and standardisation.
Visibility in this context means whether or not the presence of extensive
electronic systems should be apparent to the driver. There is a powerful
school of European engineering philosophy which would prefer such technology
to be 'transparent', functioning entirely behind the scenes, so that the
actual driving task remains as simple and straightforward as possible: more
simple and straightforward, indeed, than it has ever been before.
Others, encouraged in some degree by marketing departments who feel they
have a better chance of selling more expensive cars if the technology behind
the expense is immediately apparent, want to see the power of electronics
brought to the 'driver interface'. In other words, communication between the
driver and the vehicle will become electronic rather than manual.
One reason for the current surge of interest in navigation systems is that
their technology appears to fall between the two extremes. Which works best,
a display screen or audible instructions? How does the driver best tell the
system where he wants to go - by keying into a computer-type keyboard, or by
issuing verbal instructions into a microphone?
As yet, there are no clear answers to such questions.
It is the need for standardisation, however, which is most occupying the
automotive electronics industry. Even within a single car, the need clearly
exists. We have already reached the stage where an engineer developing a new
system, and needing a specific piece of information - how fast the car is
going, how fast the engine is turning - will usually find that the
information is already being supplied by a sensor to an existing system.
It is far cheaper and easier to tap into that source - as long as the
information is being supplied in a form which the new system can accept.
That used not to be a problem, but the mushroom growth in the number of
sensors, systems, and types of information is beginning to make it one. Some
of the largest and most 'technical' cars, such as Mercedes' S-class, already
have a 'databus' and a formal protocol to speed the exchange of information
between systems (as well as saving the weight of a hefty wiring loom, and
gaining reliability through the elimination of countless electrical
connections). But which information standard, which communications protocol
will become the worldwide standard?
There is a need for such a standard, because we are rapidly approaching the
point at which cars will be able to communicate with a roadside
infrastructure of navigation and information 'beacons', and with each other.
This is the essential technology behind programmes such as the pan-European
Prometheus, now reaching fruition, and which aims to increase safety and
efficiency, and reduce emissions, by minimising traffic conflicts and
allowing vehicles to spend more of their time travelling at a steady speed.
Such universal systems will only be able to operate properly if every
vehicle is speaking the same 'language'.
The commercial rewards of developing from the outset equipment which
conforms to the eventually adopted standard will be immense: manufacturers
in Europe, Japan and the US are well aware of this, with the result that a
techno-political battle royal is likely to be joined in the final years of
the century.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (26): Cash-rich Volvo wary of
new alliances - Sweden: Hugh Carnegy finds the two niche producers
profitable but introspective
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Volvo and Saab Automobile, Sweden's two car manufacturers, are once again
savouring the rare taste of profits after several turbulent years of losses,
heavy restructuring and, in Volvo's case, the trauma in 1993 of its aborted
plan to merge with France's Renault.
Volvo, still Sweden's biggest manufacturing company, is at group level
enjoying a resurgence of profitability to rival the pre-recession boom days
of the mid- and late-1980s. In the first six months it posted a pre-tax
profit of SKr9.02bn, compared with SKr380m in the same period last year.
Although inflated by capital gains of SKr4.08bn, the operating profit of
SKr4.47bn was far ahead of the SKr166m returned in the first half of 1993.
A 20 per cent rise in unit car sales during the period, to 189,000, was an
important factor in the group result. The car division, which has stacked up
heavy losses throughout the 1990s, finally returned to an operating profit
of SKr1.47bn from a loss on SKr70bn last time. Sales were particularly
strong in the US, Volvo's biggest market, where the company outsells all
other European car makers.
At Saab, the picture is less dramatic but no less significant, given the
trouble it has been in since the US's General Motors bought a half share in
the company in late 1989 and took over the management.
In the second quarter, as the benefits fed through of the successful launch
last year of the new Saab 900 car, Saab produced its first quarterly profit
for five years, and the first since GM became joint owner with Sweden's
Saab-Scania. This allowed Saab to show a first-half profit of SKr104m - a
modest figure, but a very welcome relief for GM after accumulated losses
since 1989 of SKr11bn and capital injections of more than SKr8bn.
But if the two companies are now able to look to the future with more
confidence than they have for some time, there remain big question-marks
over what shape they will be in when the motor industry cycle takes its next
downturn.
Volvo, in particular, is still in the process of a deep strategic rethink,
following the collapse last December of the plan to merge with Renault. Pehr
Gyllenhammar, the former chairman, wanted, in effect, to transform Volvo
into a diversified industrial group through moving the car, truck and bus
operations into a merged Renault-Volvo operation in which Volvo would have a
35 per cent share. The two companies, which had operated a strategic
alliance since 1990, were to develop jointly their new car model ranges for
the mid- and late-1990s, sharing as many systems and components as possible,
including common 'platforms' or chassis.
The rejection of the merger by shareholders and senior management - and the
resignation of Mr Gyllenhammar - threw previous assumptions about product
development into the air. The new Volvo chairman, Bert-Olof Svanholm, says
it set back the product development process at least six months.
Under Mr Svanholm and Soren Gyll, the chief executive, Volvo's new overall
strategy is to sell off up to SKr40bn worth of non-core assets and
concentrate on its core car and truck operations. This, along with resurgent
profits flow not expected to peak until 1996, will provide the financial
backing needed to fund the next generation of cars and trucks.
'Volvo will be an extremely cash-rich company,' says Colin Whitbread, motor
industry analyst with Swiss Bank Corporation in London. 'It will probably be
the strongest in balance-sheet terms in the industry in Europe. The question
is: what will they do with the money to earn a better return than they get
at present from their other assets?'
Volvo says it will not complete until later this year a thorough reappraisal
launched after it broke off the Renault marriage of how to develop its
present narrow range of three basic car models, the medium-sized 400 series,
the new 850 and the largest 900 series.
The underlying aim is to break out of Volvo's traditional limited market
appeal based on safe, reliable but rather dull cars.
A significant start on producing more dynamic models, giving greater
'driving pleasure', was made with the launch of the 850, the sportiest
full-sized saloon ever made by Volvo. A new medium-sized car, code-named the
V40, is due out within 18 months.
But Volvo has some way to go to establish a sportier style while it is
facing ever stiffer competition in its traditional stronghold of
safety-first, spacious estate cars from a range of rivals. Volvo has also
missed out on other opportunities - such as the big growth in the US and
Europe of 'people carrier' minivans (like the Renault Espace) and
four-wheel-drive Land Rover-type vehicles. It also missed the surge in
popularity in Europe of diesel-engined cars.
The company faces a dilemma in addressing these issues. It does not have
ambitions to go beyond being a niche car producer. With a total production
capacity likely to hit 425,000 cars a year next year, against expected 1994
sales of 350,000, it is approaching capacity limits, but does not intend big
production increases that could lead to dangerous overcapacity it
experienced in the early 1990s.
But such relatively small output figures mean Volvo faces the problem of how
to produce strong profit margins while carrying high units costs  -
especially if it wants to launch wholly new models such as a Volvo people
carrier.
This raises the question of whether Volvo will look for a new partner to
succeed Renault. Such a move would match conventional motor-industry wisdom
that producers must share high development costs to get full returns. But
Volvo does not seem in the mood for another major alliance  - even if a
partner were readily available.
It does already have a venture in the Netherlands with Mitsubishi of Japan
and the Dutch government, which produces the 400 series. This venture will
make the V40. But beyond that, the signals from Volvo are that it will seek
co-operation agreements with other manufactures on parts of cars, such as
engines, gear boxes and other systems, rather than a new strategic alliance.
Meanwhile at Saab, the priority is to consolidate the return to profit,
rather than to take any bold new leaps. Saab this year expects to sell
94,000 cars, well up from last year's 73,600 and comfortably over the new
break-even level of 83,000.
The next step after the all-new 900 model is to revamp the bigger 9000, a
development which is now under way. But Saab has yet to say whether it will
go ahead with a third model line GM once talked of adding to the range.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (27): Design a high priority in
the luxury market - Stuart Marshall assesses the new models on offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Will a radical change in construction materials and techniques put Audi up
among the front runners in the luxury car stakes in 1995? Its new A8 quattro
saloon's light alloy space frame and panels save weight and fuel; Tiptronic
transmission gives drivers the benefits of automatic or manual shifting; and
four-wheel drive allows them to make full use of its 4.0-litre, multi-valve
V8s 300 horsepower on wet or dry surfaces.
But by itself, this technology may not be enough to ensure sales success.
When it comes to styling and mechanical layout, status conscious luxury car
drivers are remarkably conservative. Thus the new BMW 7-Series has classic
rear-wheel drive and lines remarkably like those of its predecessor, while
the new Jaguar XJ saloon, roomier inside yet slimmer looking, has even
reverted to the twin round headlamps of an earlier model.
In business motoring's middle reaches, General Motors has stayed faithful to
rear-wheel drive for its Opel (Vauxhall in the UK) Omega, as has Ford with
its heavily revamped Scorpio.
Drivers of these classes of car know what they want - smoothness and
silence, ample power and air conditioning, automatic transmission and a
built-in telephone, airbags and anti-lock brakes.
Next year the list will extend to satellite navigation, to be offered in
Mercedes-Benz's most prestigious S-Class, BMW's 7-Series and, probably the
successor to Japan's trend-setting luxury car, the Lexus LS400.
In the medium/large class most of the past year's newcomers - the Renault
Laguna is typical - have conformed to a pattern; front-wheel drive
(occasionally with an all-wheel drive option), space-saving
transversely-mounted engines, standard airbags and anti-lock brakes and the
easy availability of air-conditioning and automatic transmission.
Choice of a diesel as an alternative to a petrol engine has become
essential. Only two European business car providers of any consequence -
Saab and Jaguar - do not have diesels in their product ranges. Both are
likely to add diesels, with engines bought-in rather than developed in-
house, within the next two or three years.
Great strides are being made in car diesel technology. For now, BMW's
in-line turbocharged and intercooled six-cylinder units have no peers for
urgent and near silent power delivery.
Mercedes-Benz, with the world's first four valves-per-cylinder passenger car
diesels, and PSA Group's latest 2.5-litre diesels with twin balancer shafts,
have brought diesel smoothness close to petrol engine standards while
benefiting from higher torque at low revolutions and cleaner exhaust
emissions.
BMW's just introduced four-cylinder diesel is raising the stakes in the
market for less expensive, fuel efficient business cars. For fuel economy
combined with acceptable refinement, VW-Audi's direct-injection diesels, as
fitted in Audi 80 and 100 and VW Golf and Passat models, lead the pack.
Rover's direct-injection engined 600 diesel saloon will soon rival their
standards.
Sales of on-off road 4x4s have maintained their impetus. The vehicles have
become civilised, if rather thirsty, on-road car substitutes and rarely
venture on to the rough terrain which they were designed to tackle.
Land Rover's latest Range Rover with height-adjustable air suspension is put
forward as an alternative to conventional luxury cars in the BMW, Jaguar and
Mercedes-Benz class.
Although its two beam axles cannot reasonably be expected to equal the ride
comfort of a sophisticated all-independent system, it is a most urbane
performer on the road and remains capable off it.
One of the attractions of on-off road vehicles such as Range Rover is their
so-called command driving position. It gives users a feeling of superiority
and allows them to see over the tops of normal cars ahead.
Similar benefits are offered by multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) which lack the
high-slung 4x4s largely unused off-road capability.
Their market penetration is forecast to grow substantially in Europe as new
models such as the joint Portugese-produced Ford-VW project come on stream.
Whether this will be at the expense of on-off road 4x4s or conventional
estate cars remains to be seen.
In the past eight years, sales of MPVs such as the Renault Espace (still
market leader in Europe) have risen by an average 80 per cent per annum.
By the end of the century it is expected that 700,000 MPVs will be sold in
Europe each year.
This forecast makes the introduction of a range of MPVs built by PSA but
which will be sold badged as Citroens, Peugeots, Fiats and Lancias among the
most significant motoring events of 1994.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (24): Rising imports cause
anxiety - Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tumbling car prices triggered by tax cuts and improved productivity are
unleashing pent-up demand in Brazil, which was the fastest-growing big
market for vehicles last year.
Despite this good news, locally-based manufacturers are worried about the
rise in imports, as well as a continuing productivity gap with foreign
competitors, some of which are considering whether to move production to
Brazil.
After averaging 800,000-900,000 vehicles a year in the 1980s, Brazil's
manufacturers churned out nearly 1.4m vehicles last year, up 30 per cent on
the year before. This made the industry Latin America's biggest producer and
No 10 globally. Production this year is likely to approach 1.6m vehicles.
Exports within the Mercosur common market, which comes into force on January
1 and will include Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, may also
increase. Last year Brazil exported 218,000 vehicles to Argentina compared
with 83,000 in 1991.
The Mercosur countries are negotiating a transitional agreement for the car
industry, which will cover rules on regional content and a common external
tariff. Companies are investing to standardise and integrate production
between Brazilian and Argentine plants.
However, some analysts believe that the overvaluation of Brazil's new
currency, the Real, and Argentine worries about its trade deficit raise
uncertainties about vehicle exports to Argentina in the future.
Brazilian car executives believe the big growth potential is in the local
market where there are just five cars per 100 inhabitants compared with 11
in Argentina and 30 in Europe.
Domestic demand has grown as local car makers have had to compete since the
economy was opened up at the beginning of the decade. This cut tariffs and
imported vehicles have grown from 15,000 in 1991 to a likely 120,000
vehicles this year, forcing local manufacturers to improve productivity and
quality.
Productivity at Fiat, General Motors and Autolatina, the holding company for
the joint operations of Ford and Volkswagen, has increased by an average 17
per cent a year this decade due to higher volumes combined with a reduced
workforce and the contracting out of services. Quality has also improved,
with defects falling by 50 per cent over the period, according to a report
by consultants Booz-Allen earlier this year.
More importantly, agreements between the government and the industry since
1992 have cut taxes and profit margins. Taxes have fallen by an average 22
per cent, leading to a dramatic fall in prices, particularly for 1,000cc
cars where the reductions were concentrated.
The price of VW's 1,000cc Gol car has fallen from Dollars 13,000 to just
over Dollars 7,000 in the past three years, says Pierre Alain de Smedt,
Autolatina chairman.
But there could be problems ahead for Brazil's manufacturers. Despite the
productivity gains, they are still 10 per cent less efficient than Europeans
and further behind the Japanese, says Booz-Allen. Thanks to the growing
local market, they face the threat that competitors who are now importing
cars could start to produce in Brazil. Nissan and Toyota are thought to be
planning investments.
The companies are also concerned about the rise in imports and are calling
for quotas to be imposed, which the government has so far refused. They
argue that, despite the tax cuts, Brazilian vehicles are still overburdened
compared with foreign cars.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (21): One bright spot in a
sluggish market - Japan: Michiyo Nakamoto examines the painful reversal in
the industry's fortunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past few months, employees at a Toyota car factory in Motomachi,
Nagoya, have been putting in extra hours to keep up with strong demand.
The Motomachi factory is the manufacturing base for a 4-wheel-drive
recreational vehicle called RAV4, which has been a spectacular success in
the five months since it was launched.
In the RAV4, Toyota hit on a formula for success that reflects the
fundamental changes Japan's car market has seen in the past years.
Its off-roader filled a gap for Japanese consumers. It is a different kind
of passenger car, available at a much lower price than they had come to
expect.
However, the RAV4 has been a conspicuously bright spot in Japan's otherwise
stubbornly sluggish auto market.
Following three years of falling demand, the Japanese car market suffered
another 3 per cent fall in domestic demand in the first half of this year to
3.3m units, while exports declined by 20 per cent to 2.2m.
In 1993, domestic sales of new passenger cars fell to 4.2m units, down 5.7
per cent from the previous year, while 1992 saw an 8.5 per cent decline.
The reversal in the Japanese automakers' fortunes has been all the more
painful, as it followed three years to 1990 of spectacular growth. During
that period, new car sales jumped 150 per cent, Yutaka Kume, chairman of
Nissan, the country's second largest carmaker, said.
Three years of falling demand have, however, wiped out any hope Japanese car
makers may have had for a return to the boom years when prestige, rather
than price, was the main concern for the domestic market.
Instead, given the country's shrinking population growth and a trend to
greater economy, Japan's market is expected to stabilise at an annual growth
rate of about 1-2 per cent, compared with an average of 9 per cent in the
three years to 1990, Mr Kume said.
Furthermore, competition will intensify as the greater price competitiveness
of foreign-made cars in a high-yen environment has opened up Japan's
domestic market to a high level of imports.
In the first six months of this year, registrations of imported automobiles
rose 40 per cent to nearly 138,000 units, according to the Japan Automobile
Importers Association. As awareness and availability of foreign cars
increases, their popularity is expected to continue growing.
At the same time, exports have been in steady decline, for the eighth
consecutive year in 1993.
The trend is in part a result of the falling competitiveness of Japanese
cars overseas due to the yen's appreciation, but more fundamentally as a
result of increased production overseas.
That trend is expected to accelerate further, as political pressures, the
comparatively high costs of manufacturing in Japan and the growing necessity
of developing models that are suited to particular regional needs are making
it imperative that Japanese carmakers further globalise their operations.
Amid these structural changes, Japanese carmakers have been conducting a
fundamental review their entire operations.
'In this market environment, we at the Japanese automobile industry who
enjoyed a continued expansion in production up until recently, are now
pressed to undertake a major restructuring,' Mr Kume said.
One pillar of restructuring will be increased globalisation of operations as
carmakers come under pressure from the yen to reduce their dependence on
Japan as a world manufacturing base, and to seek growth in overseas markets.
'From now on, growth for Japanese auto makers will come mainly from outside
Japan,' said one industry analyst.
In response, Japanese carmakers have been building their operations in
south-east Asia and China, and strengthening their manufacturing
capabilities in western markets.
Toyota recently made clear its intention to increase local vehicle
production in North America by more than 50 per cent, to double engine
production, and to increase exports from the region to other countries,
including Japan, by 60 per cent.
Production of the popular pick-up truck sold in the US will be moved
entirely to North America.
Honda, meanwhile, aims to give more autonomy to its global manufacturing
bases and lessen dependency on Japan.
The company will increase spending in North American facilities by Dollars
310m in a bid to boost manufacturing and R&amp;D capacity. Exports from North
America are expected almost to double this year, and double again by the
turn of the decade.
In Europe, Honda plans to increase capacity at its UK manufacturing plant so
that about half the cars sold in Europe could be produced there.
At the other end of the spectrum, Mazda has been left somewhat behind in the
move to globalise. It is particularly vulnerable in Europe, where plans to
share production facilities with Ford, the US auto maker which owns more
than 24 per cent in Mazda, collapsed early last year.
The other pillar of restructuring in the Japanese auto industry is the
adjustment of domestic production.
One important aspect of Toyota's success with its RAV4 has been the
company's ability to reduce costs by increasing commonality of parts with
other cars, and keeping the car very simple.
'We decided to make the car as simple as possible and not to include
anything unnecessary,' explained Masakatsu Nonaka, chief engineer of the
RAV4.
By restricting the car to one engine, one body and one grade, a
revolutionary step for Toyota, the car maker was able to substantially lower
costs.
Other Japanese carmakers have been pursuing the same goal, and some have
enjoyed similar successes to Toyota.
However, shifting production overseas and reducing costs will not alone be
remedy for their woes.
Japanese carmakers have yet to face up to the overcapacity that remains in
the domestic market.
While overall sales of new cars have recovered slightly in the past months,
helped by a long-awaited tax cut, domestic demand is unlikely to recover to
the levels seen during the peak years, while exports will continue to
decrease as production is shifted overseas. As a result domestic production,
which fell from almost 13.5m units in 1990 to 11.2m last year, is not
expected to recover significantly.
Even while recognising the problem, Japanese auto makers have been reluctant
to implement full-scale capacity cuts.
At the lower end of the manufacturing pyramid, smaller sub-contractors are
showing the strains of reduced domestic production. Since the beginning of
last year, 127 auto parts suppliers in Japan have collapsed, according to
Teikoku Data Bank, a private research company. Sooner or later, the wider
impact of the structural changes facing the industry is likely to be seen
higher up the pyramid.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (22): Expanding, but it's a
gamble - Korea: The ambitions of the country's Big Three
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Korean car manufacturers are taking perhaps their biggest gamble since
the industry was established in the 1960s by doubling their production
capacity to at least 6m vehicles annually by 2000, with a third of this
amount manufactured abroad.
The rapid expansion is risky when the global car industry is already
struggling with surplus production. But Korea's leading industries have
traditionally been addicted to large-scale production to achieve economies
of scale in spite of dire predictions about adverse market conditions.
Korea's three leading carmakers - Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo - are hoping to
repeat the success of the country's shipbuilding, electronics and
petrochemical companies, which added massive production capacity during the
last five years and are now reaping the benefits by quickly filling rising
global demand.
The expansion of car production has the support of the government, which
selected the motor industry as a vital sector in 1990 and gave it easy
access to state-subsidised bank loans and overseas borrowing privileges to
raise capital for the capacity increase.
If the expansion goes according to plan, Korea will become fourth biggest
car manufacturer in the world by end of the decade, with its three main
companies being included among the top ten carmakers.
Hyundai wants to increase its production from 1.16m vehicles this year to
2.3m in the year 2000. Production will double to 1.5m at Kia by 1997 and
quandruple to 2.2m at Daewoo by the end of the decade.
Ssangyong, which produces commerical trucks and sports vehicles, also plans
to start car manufacturing in late 1996 in cooperation with Mercedes-Benz.
Its initial production of 50,000 cars is expected to rise to 150,000 by
2000.
'The Koreans are contradicting the global trend toward downsizing,' said Don
Lee, motor industry analyst at BZW Securities in Seoul. 'They are justifying
the expansion by going into new markets in the developing world.'
Exports now account for only a quarter of Korean car production, but
manufacturers want to raise the ratio to 40 or 50 per cent within the next
several years as growth in the domestic market slows down to an annual rate
of 10 per cent from 40 per cent in the late 1980s. The weakness of the
Korean currency against the strong yen is likely to benefit Korea in its
export plans.
Overseas sales in developing countries accounted for 46.2 per cent of
exports during the first half of 1994, while shipments to North America
accounted for 37.4 per cent of exports and western Europe 16.4 per cent.
The car companies are concentrating on increasing their market share in the
developing world by building local assembly plants to avoid possible tariff
barriers. Hyundai has signed joint-venture agreements in Indonesia, the
Philippines, Egypt and Zimbabwe to produce a total of 300,000 cars abroad.
Kia will also produce 300,000 cars overseas through planned facilities in
Indonesia, Mexico, India and Morocco.
Daewoo has set a more ambitious target of producing 1m cars in the
developing world to take advantage of the region's low wages. Joint ventures
have been established in Uzbekistan, Iran, India and Vietnam. Daewoo is now
negotiating to build a car parts factory in China as the first step toward
gaining approval from Beijing for the construction of a car factory in what
is potentially its largest overseas market.
But the Korean carmakers are not neglecting the US and Europe. While Hyundai
already has a strong presence in these markets, its rivals are following
suit.
Kia began establishing distribution networks in the US and Europe last year
and recently signed an agreement with Karmann of Germany to produce its
Sportage four-wheel drive vehicle for the European market from next year.
Daewoo has acquired a car plant in Romania to supply vehicles for its
independent West European dealer network, which will begin operations in
1995. It will also enter the US market in 1996.
But while Korean carmakers are aggressively expanding abroad, they must
worry about the opening of their strongly protected home market to imports.
The US and the EU are demanding that Korea reduce duties and non-tariff
barriers that limited the sale of foreign cars in Korea to slightly less
than 2,000 last year, only 0.19 of the total market.
Seoul recently agreed to cut the car tariff to 8 per cent from 10 per cent
and ease restrictions on TV advertising and distribution outlets, but the
concessions have still not satisfied Washington, which has led the campaign
against the car import restrictions.
Even if further concessions are made, sales of US and European cars in Korea
are not likely to represent much of a threat to domestic manufacturers since
the foreign models will be concentrated in the executive car segment.
A more serious worry would be abolition of the two decade-old ban on car
imports from Japan. It remains undecided whether the Korea will lift the ban
in 1997 as part of a programme to improve trade relations with Japan. But
Tokyo is expected to demand this action if Korea wants to gain membership in
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 1996.
The irony is that the Korean motor industry has largely developed due to
technical help provided by Japanese car manufacturers. Hyundai has a
partnership with Mitsubishi, Kia with Mazda and Ford, and Daewoo recently
linked up with Honda after dissolving its joint venture with General Motors.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (25): Nafta makes its mark -
Mexico: recovery in the US has caused exports to rise
</HEADLINE>

The North American Free Trade Agreement, implemented only nine months ago,
has already had a powerful impact on the car and truck industry in Mexico.
Both imports and exports are sharply up, while companies not previously
operating in the country have announced plans to set up manufacturing
operations.
In the seven months to July, Mexico exported 304,923 vehicles, primarily to
the US, an increase of 26.6 per cent on the same period last year.
Meanwhile, imports were still relatively small at 25,277 vehicles, yet this
represents a 454 per cent increase from the year before. The US Big Three
carmakers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler  - almost completely
monopolised the import boom.
The increase in exports is primarily attributed to economic recovery, and
therefore rising demand, in the US. But the growth in exports to the US, as
well as Japan, is expected to continue over the medium term as carmakers
invest some Dollars 1.6bn in 1994 alone to increase capacity and modernise
plants. Nissan recently announced that it would move its entire Sentra
production line from Japan to its Aguascalientes, Mexico, plant. This new
factory will supply the US, Mexican, Japanese and other Asian and Latin
American markets.
The rise in imports is primarily due, as stipulated in Nafta, to a loosening
of the complex formula which linked a company's ability to import with its
level of exports. GM has been highly successful with its new line of Chevy
subcompacts brought in from Spain. Based on its first few months on the
market, the Chevy could be a formidable challenger to the Volkswagen Bug,
the market leader. The US company now says it may set up a Mexican
production line for the budget car.
Ford and Chrysler are taking shots at Nissan's Tsuru, the leader in the
compact class, but in different ways. Chrysler is importing its US-produced
Neon, while Ford has begun to sell previously for-export-only Escorts from
its Hermosillo plant. This arrangement gives Ford the ability to use its
import quota for high mark-up luxury cars.
During the Nafta negotiations, Mexico fought hard for low domestic content
rules in order to encourage newcomers to set up shop and export to the US.
With the agreement's stiff 62.5 per cent domestic content stipulation,
Mexico has been pleasantly surprised that newcomers have announced Dollars
300m investments this year to initiate operations. This new production will
be mostly for the domestic and Latin American markets.
BMW, the German carmaker, will account for Dollars 176m of that sum as it
sets up domestic production, scheduled to come on line in 1995. Production
at this new plant will be southerly oriented, with small and mid-size models
destined for the Mexican market and other Latin countries. There will be
only limited integration with the new BMW plant to be built in the US.
Honda is expanding its motorcycle plant in Guadalajara to include facilities
for assembling cars for the domestic market and Latin American exports. At
first, cars will be made from part-kits supplied by Honda plants and
contractors in the US, but Mexico is expected to become an important parts
centre as Honda works towards its goal of production of at least 75 per cent
of its North American sales from plants in the continent.
Mercedes-Benz is setting up a luxury car production line at its rapidly
expanding truck plant and is building a new passenger bus factory in
northern Mexico in an attempt to penetrate the US market. Mercedes' main
competitor in the truck and bus business, Dina, recently bought Motor Coach
Industries, the US market giant, and has spoken to Toyota, Hyundai and Fiat
about setting up a joint venture to expand into car production in Mexico.
Despite the optimism of the new players and plans to increase capacity among
established competitors, domestic sales continue to fall amid general
economic uncertainty and tight credit. Domestic sales dropped 3 per cent in
the first seven months of the year, to 343,207 vehicles. The launch of
carmakers' own in-house retail credit divisions such as GMAC and Ford
Credit, a by-product of the Nafta financial services regulations, should
lead to some market recuperation towards the end of the year.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (23): Steady growth is the goal
 -China plays a waiting game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China could not be accused of lacking ambition in formulating a policy to
meet rapidly increasing demand for cars and commercial vehicles into the
next century.
The long-awaited Policy for China Automotive Industry Enterprises, released
in July, sets the goal of making a hitherto fragmented, low-volume,
poor-quality sector into one of the country's 'pillar' industries.
Policy-makers appear to have grasped the importance of a vibrant automotive
sector to the economy as a whole. But in the interests of orderly
development, they are delaying approvals of new foreign entrants until 1996,
pending a consolidation of existing plant and facilities.
Beijing also wants to strengthen the components sector, a weak link in its
vehicle-building industry. Foreign car companies such as Ford, General
Motors and Toyota have been told that to 'qualify' for entry to China as
fully-fledged participants in passenger car manufacturing they must first
invest in the components industry.
Since China opened its doors to foreign investors in the 1980s, a few
international car-makers, led by Volkswagen, have established a foothold.
The German company is producing the Santana (a copy of its Passat produced
in Brazil) in Shanghai and Audis and Jettas at a plant in Changchun,
northern China.
Other foreign participants include Chrysler, building the Jeep Cherokee in
Beijing; Daihatsu, producing a minibus in Tianjin; Toyota and General Motors
which are building commercial vehicles in Shenyang; Peugeot which has a
venture assembling 504s in southern China and Citroen which is producing its
ZX small car near Wuhan.
Apart from Volkswagen. which built about 150,000 vehicles in China last
year, the others are still relatively small-scale operators. Citroen, for
example, assembled just 13,000 of its ZXs in 1993.
China's output of passenger and other vehicles falls well short of demand.
In 1993, 234,000 passenger cars were produced of a total 1.3m vehicles
manufactured locally. Some 310,461 vehicles were imported, according to
official figures, but this did not take account of thousands more that were
smuggled in.
By 2000, domestic demand for passenger cars is expected to exceed 2m with
local car-makers supplying 90 per cent of the market under the terms of the
new plan. At present, car-sales to individuals as opposed to companies and
work units account for about 1 per cent of the total, but demand is building
among an increasingly affluent bourgeoisie.
In its efforts to promote the development of the automotive sector, the
government has laid down guidelines envisaging the development by the end of
this century of two or three 'large-scale' vehicle-producing conglomerates
and six or seven 'backbone' automotive enterprises.
This formula, aimed particularly at encouraging economies of scale, leaves
the door open for new entrants after the present freeze expires in 1996.
China is making little secret of the fact that it is anxious to involve the
big American and Japanese producers.
Ford and GM are already establishing a strong presence in the components
sector. Ford, for example, recently signed agreements with components makers
in Shanghai to produce plastic automotive items such as instrument panels
and to make safety glass. Ford plans to invest Dollars 50m in these
ventures.
GM's Automotive Components Group (ACG) recently established a headquarters
in Beijing and is seeking to enlarge its involvement in the components
sector where it is engaged in joint ventures and licensing arrangements.
While China's new automotive policy is aimed at encouraging through tax and
other incentives the growth of large-scale producers, it is also directed at
rationalising a highly-fragmented local sector. There are, for example,
120-130 vehicle-makers of one sort or another operating in China, but many
are tiny, producing just a few vehicles each week.
According to a recent study, quoted by the official China Daily newspaper,
two-thirds of China's vehicle manufacturers lost money in the first half of
this year, and a number were heading for bankruptcy. The highly-fragmented
components sector is in a similarly parlous state, and many small producers
are expected to go out of business under the new policy, with its emphasis
on high volume production and economies of scale.
In spite of the freeze on new entrants to assembly and manufacturing until
1996, foreign car makers are extremely active in ongoing discussions about
new projects. These discussions are expected to lead to a number of
agreements over the next six months or so.
Chrysler, for one, is believed to be close to finalising deals to produce
minivans in Guangdong and Hainan provinces. A number of carmakers, including
Toyota, Ford, GM and Mazda, are involved in discussions with the Shanghai
Automobile Industry Corp for a minivan and passenger car project in the
Shanghai area.
Toyota has also been in discussions with the Tianjin Automobile Industry
Corp on possible ventures. Tianjin Auto is the partner of Daihatsu in the
production of the Charade small car and minibuses. Toyota has a 16 per cent
stake in Daihatsu. According to Japanese press reports, Toyota hopes by the
end of this year to start building a factory near Tianjin to produce
engines, transmissions and other key components for cars that would be sold
domestically. Toyota is reportedly proposing that its Corolla small car
would be the most suitable product for the China market.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (19): Pacific Rim output on the
up - Asia: Ian Robertson examines the market's renewed expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN ROBERTSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Congestion, low incomes, government policy, pollution and underdeveloped
roads will all hamper market progress in some Pacific Rim countries, but the
average rate of growth will still be almost four times that of the west.
The new-vehicle markets of the region registered a 12 per cent increase, to
1.9m sales, in 1993 - and this did not include the large growth markets of
China and South Korea, which together accounted for more than 2.8m sales.
Demand is likely to exceed 2m this year, and rise to over 3m (including 1.5m
cars) by 2000, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit (The Automotive
Sector of the Pacific Rim and China Report R320).
Last year's greatest volume growth occurred in Thailand, India and
Indonesia, while the more mature and congested market of Taiwan reported a
slight fall in new vehicle sales.
By the end of the decade, Thailand will overtake Taiwan to become the
region's leading vehicle market, followed by India and Indonesia; while,
with its gross domestic product now beginning to increase rapidly, Vietnam
takes its first painful steps towards motorisation.
After slipping in the previous year, vehicle production in the Pacific Rim
rose by 10 per cent, to over 1.6m units in 1993; and forecasts indicate
that, by the end of the decade, the industry will be producing 3.2m vehicles
a year.
The risks to investors in the region include potential political
uncertainty. Thailand and the Philippines have had recent difficulties and,
although stability appears to have returned, it is by no means assured.
India has a host of potential problems, from its borders with Pakistan to
states wanting to break away from the federation.
Only the Philippines, Indonesia and India have experienced any real economic
downturn in the last few years, although demand has slowed in most
countries.
All are expected to see considerable development of their infrastructures
and economic wealth over the next few years. Population growth could present
difficulties in the long term, particularly for India and Indonesia.
Conversely, the prospects for Malaysia may be limited by a labour shortage.
Income levels are still low. The passenger car market usually begins to grow
quickly when GDP per head reaches the current equivalent of about Dollars
5,000 a year. Only Taiwan has reached this level. In India GDP per head is
only Dollars 250. By this measure, for most of the region any real volume
opportunity, particularly for passenger car sales, remains some way off.
Some of the largest markets - notably Taiwan - remain effectively closed to
incoming car manufacturers, while Japanese vehicle producers and technology
already have a formidable hold in the car and light commercial vehicle
markets of the region.
In Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, Toyota will retain its
dominance. In Malaysia, Mitsubishi and Daihatsu will control the market
through their local producers. In Taiwan, there is a more fragmented
Japanese control, although Mitsubishi monopolises the commercial vehicle
sector.
In India, in spite of news of Volkswagen's latest partnership with Eicher
Goodearth, the market is dominated by Suzuki's technology; while, in
Vietnam, Mitsubishi appears to have gained the strongest role.
Although quality levels still fall short, Japan is aware of the potential of
the region's low labour costs as a refuge from the high yen, and its
policies have sought to satisfy co-operative ambitions across the region,
including the development of specific models for Pacific Rim markets.
Bangkok now has the world's worst traffic congestion. Kuala Lumpur is little
better. And Taiwan is trying to restrict sales of vehicles until its mass
transit system is complete.
Already infrastructure is lagging behind market growth, and the Tiger
economies are suffering the penalty of little or no pollution controls.
Overcapacity and restricted growth prospects elsewhere in the mature markets
of the industry have inflated interest in this emerging region.
Moreover, the rush of new investment into the Pacific Rim threatens to
result in gross capacity in excess of foreseeable demand. In the latest
market to emerge, Vietnam, the government is already concerned about
over-supply as Suzuki, Toyota, Volkswagen and Peugeot SA join others in the
latest attempt to break into the market.
With time running out, opportunities for new entrants in the region centre
on the commercial vehicle sector - notably pickups and light vans.
The other growth opportunity is in components. As the volume of vehicles
produced in the region grows, the components industry will need to
restructure and rationalise.
New entrants also offer access to advanced technology - essential for
markets such as Malaysia or Taiwan with ambitions to step up exports of
their own national vehicles.
In some markets, government-initiated programmes are stimulating development
of the automotive sector. In India, the removal of stifling controls in 1991
heralded a period of transformation for the industry. During the 1980s there
were only three vehicle manufacturers in the country, producing around
120,000 vehicles per year; now there are 13, with installed capacity of
almost 600,000 units.
Sales were lifted last year, when excise duties were reduced from 55 per
cent to 40 per cent, resulting in lower car prices and further reductions in
the tax burden are expected.
Competition for industry leader Maruti/Suzuki is growing. Other local
producers are keen to enter the smaller car segment: Mahindra, Telco, Bajaj
and Escorts. In addition, Premier, already the second largest supplier in
the car market, has spent much of the past few years exploring new
opportunities.
Hindustan Motors, the third main supplier in the car sector, is working on a
rival in collaboration with Germany's Opel; while Eicher will start
production with Volkswagen in 1997. A new entrant, Sipani, has also signed
an agreement with Rover to produce the Montego. Other challenges come from
Mercedes-Benz, Daewoo and, significantly, from the motor-cycle industry.
Japan's grip on the Indonesian market is overwhelming and getting tighter.
Japanese producers control 99 per cent of the commercial vehicle market and
over 80 per cent of the smaller car sector. They are investing in new
facilities and introducing new models. They have increased their shares in
local assemblers, and are supporting the Indonesian government's plans to
develop a regional Asean components industry.
Their dominance of the market has forced many weaker competitors - both US
and European - to withdraw in recent years. Outstanding growth prospects are
still luring newcomers in, however, not least Volkswagen's Seat and Skoda,
Proton, Hyundai, Opel and Kia.
In Malaysia, the government is keen to build on the success of Proton. A
second national project has just started production, making the Kancil in
partnership with Daihatsu. A third project is planned involving pickups with
Hyundai, and a fourth is on the drawing board.
The Philippines government is trying to stimulate the sector with the
development of a smaller, inexpensive people's car.
This has brought Kia, Honda, Daihatsu, Fiat and Daewoo into the market as
assemblers. The car development programme will regulate the industry until
at least 1998, when local content requirements may be scrapped, with a
radical change in market structure expected to follow.
In Taiwan, industry attention centres on the Gatt, which could mean that
import tariffs on vehicles and parts will have to fall quickly, with
devastating implications for local producers. The challenges to the
country's export drive are also mounting.
To boost the local industry and to meet the conditions of the GATT, the
government in Thailand is liberalising the sector.
In 1990, it lifted a ban on imports under 2.3 litres. Vehicle taxes were cut
in the following year, and in November the government signalled that it was
to end the requirement for assemblers to have local stakeholders.
In Vietnam, still at a more embryonic stage, several vehicle manufacturers
are already queueing up to join the Mekong Corporation (Ssangyong/Fiat
Iveco) and Vietnam Motors Corporation (Colombian Motors of the Philippines)
in a bid to share the expected growth in the region's newest vehicle market.
Mitsubishi, Mercedes-Benz, Renault, BMW and other South Korean suppliers
have all sought to make substantial investments, and look likely to succeed.
Others, including Suzuki, Toyota, Volkswagen and Peugeot SA, are also trying
to break into the market, but finding entry more difficult.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (20): The Germans head west -
New BMW and Mercedes Benz plants in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Build the plant, and they will come.' So could have said BMW and Mercedes
Benz about suppliers following in their paths to invest in the US states of
South Carolina and Alabama, respectively.
For these investment hungry south-east states, the collateral investment by
the suppliers to the two German luxury carmakers is a dream come true. With
their new US plants, both BMW and Mercedes are positioning themselves to
compete more fiercely in the US, the world's largest car market, and to do
so with far lower production costs than in pricey Germany.
The hourly wage of German workers costs BMW, for example, about Dollars 25,
whereas in South Carolina it will pay Dollars 12 to start and Dollars 16
after two years. Mercedes reportedly estimates that building the new car in
Alabama will cost 30 per cent less than if built in Germany. Both
manufacturers intend to export the cars.
But it is not only labour that will come cheaper for the two German
companies. They have designed advanced state-of-the-art plants to pare down
on their own relatively more expensive manufacture or assembly of numerous
component parts. In this, they are leading the way in an industry that is
increasingly de-integrating.
Both firms will only supply critical systems - such as engines,
transmissions and suspension - and the rest will come from component
manufacturers, which bid for contracts. To assure quality and timeliness,
the two German car makers are requiring their suppliers - a majority of
which are US companies - to work closely with them in the design of the
components.
Mercedes has gone slightly further than BMW in this regard. Its plant in
Alabama will basically only bolt and weld together a series of modular
systems of parts that are already assembled.
BMW is spending at least Dollars 300m on its plant in Greer, South Carolina,
which is expected to produce its first car before the end of September. The
plant, which starts making 318i's and 325i's and next year adds a new small
two-seater sports car, will employ 2,000 people and produce 400 cars per day
by 1998.
Mercedes has construction of a Dollars 300m plant under way in Vance,
Alabama in the western county of Tuscaloosa. It will start producing a
sports utility vehicle (akin to a Range Rover) in early 1997.
Both companies expect that their final investment will be several hundred
million dollars more.
BMW's investment in Greer, a tiny town between the two South Carolina county
seats of Greenville and Spartanburg, has already brought 12 suppliers into
the area. BMW expects eventually to have a total of about 70 suppliers to
its South Carolina plant, some 24 of which are expected to locate in the
state.
Robert Hitt, spokesman for BMW in South Carolina, says that for the new
roadster, 'local content will be about 50 per cent'.
Ten of the 12 BMW suppliers have construction under way in South Carolina or
are already producing, including:
Lear Seating, a top US seat systems manufacturer;
Lemforder, a subsidiary of the German firm Lemforder Metallwaren AG, for
front axles;
Zeuna Staerker, a Germany subsidiary for mufflers;
Plastic Omnium, a French subsidiary, for bumpers and fuel tanks;
Electro Wire, a US firm, for battery cables and some wire harnesses;
Magna International of Canada for side panels and floor pans, and
Alfmeier, a German subsidiary, for fuel valves.
Some suppliers were already nearby in South Carolina, including Michelin,
the French tire maker, and Robert Bosch, the German automotive parts
company. A local firm, Spartanburg Steel, will supply body parts. And
Milliken &amp; Co, the US textile giant that is based in Spartanburg, will
supply interior and boot fabric.
At least one supplier so far will supply the US plants of both BMW and
Mercedes. Packard Electric, a leading US manufacturer of wire harnesses,
will build service centers in South Carolina and Alabama to accommodate the
two German firms. The service centers will be for distribution of harnesses
assembled in Mexico from US and European components. But they will also be
equipped and staffed to alter or re-engineer the parts if needed.
Another BMW supplier, Lemforder, will supply parts to Mercedes through ZF
Friedrichshafen AG, which will be supplying Mercedes front and rear axles
from a Tuscaloosa plant.
BMW has also found that what is good enough for its South Carolina plant is
good enough for its German factories. Lear Seating initially won the
contract to supply BMW's plant in South Carolina and will now supply its
operations at home.
Mercedes will be taking advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement
for supplies from Mexico and Canada. Lighting systems and air induction
sytems will be made by two German subsidiaries in Mexico, EOSA in Mexico
City and Filtros Mann in Naucalpan.
The Budd Company of Canada will supply frames and a US subsidiary of the
Kautex Corporation will supply fuel systems.
Because it is using innovative modular systems, Mercedes expects eventually
to have only 40-50 suppliers. 'On average,' said Lee Dennis, Mercedes'
purchasing manager in Alabama, 'automotive OEMs have 300-400 separate parts
suppliers.' While there may be 300-400 parts, Mercedes is arranging its
supplier relationships so that it depends only on its first tier of key
modular suppliers, who in turn assembled components.
The goal for Mercedes local content, said Mr Dennis, will be 65 to 70 per
cent of the vehicle. He expects to have 90 per cent of Mercedes suppliers
selected by the end of the year.
As production begins to roll off the lines in South Carolina and Alabama,
the two German companies hope to prove not only that they can build superior
quality cars in the US, but also that they can do so far more cheaply than
at home.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (15): Sharpening reflexes -
Profile: Ford
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<TEXT>
Ford Motor, in many respects the most successful US car company over the
past decade, is in the early stages of an ambitious plan to create a global
car company, which it hopes will cut its costs, quicken its reflexes and
give it a sharp competitive edge.
The second largest US vehicle manufacturer, in its most sweeping
reorganisation for 25 years, plans at the end of this year to merge two huge
units - North American Operations and Ford of Europe - into a single
operating unit, Ford Automotive Operations.
Until now, Ford has had a tradition of independent regional fiefdoms, with
American and European operations developing cars of essentially the same
size, but with different characteristics aimed at their local markets.
The shift is no small gamble by Alex Trotman, the British-born executive who
took over as chairman of Ford at the start of this year. He says the
upheaval is designed to 'combine the resources of a large and very
successful company with the speed and responsiveness of a small company.'
The shake-up involves Ford reorganising into five vehicle programme centres
(VPCs), four in North America and one in Europe. The European VPC, with
research and engineering centres split between the UK and Germany, will be
responsible for developing small and medium front-wheel drive cars for sale
in Europe, America and Asia.
The other four VPCs, based in Detroit, will develop large, front-wheel drive
cars, such as the Ford Taurus; rear-wheel drive cars, such as the Ford Crown
Victoria; personal trucks, such as the Explorer sports utility vehicle, and
commercial trucks.
While elements of the Ford plan have some parallels with initiatives at its
US rivals, GM and Chrysler, no car company anywhere has such an ambitious
global integration scheme under way.
But Ford, which in many respects has set the pace for the US motor industry
over the past decade, needs a sustained burst of innovation to maintain its
competitiveness against rivals such as Chrysler, which has emerged over the
past two years as particularly lean and aggressive.
Forced by financial crisis to cut costs in the early 1980s, Ford improved
productivity in its plants long before GM and Chrysler and still boasts the
most productive North American factories among the Big Three.
It has also scored some huge hits with consumers, notably with the Ford
Taurus in the mid-1980s, which revolutionised US family car design and is
currently the top-selling US car (though Honda's Accord is again challenging
for that title). Other successes include the Explorer sports utility vehicle
and the revamped sporty Mustang car.
These models helped Ford increase its share of the US car and light truck
market from about 23 per cent in 1987 to some 25.4 per cent last year,
though in the first six months of 1994 there was slippage to 24.9 per cent.
However, this success has yet to translate into adequate profits. In the
first half of this year the group's net profits were Dollars 2.62bn,
compared to Dollars 1.35bn in the same period of 1993, while its worldwide
automotive profits quadrupled from Dollars 571m to Dollars 2.14bn.
David McCammon, the group's treasurer, has says 'our return on sales isn't
to the level we believe it needs to be'. He adds that Ford made only 69 per
cent of Chrysler's profits on each vehicle it sold in the second quarter and
needed to lower development and purchasing costs, and continue to shift
production from cars to more profitable light truck lines.
External critics have also long complained that Ford is particularly slow in
the time it takes to develop models.
The global reorganisation is designed to address some of these problems. Mr
Trotman reckons it should save the company Dollars 2bn to Dollars 3bn by the
end of the decade.
Ford has some experience with global integration, thanks to its development
over the past six years of the Mondeo, the first 'world car' designed to be
sold around the world. It has been a big hit in Europe and is being
introduced to the US this year.
Analysts sceptical about the global integration drive point to the long
gestation and high costs (Dollars 6bn) of the Mondeo programme. But Mr
Trotman says: 'Our investment is in much more than hardware. We've been
buying a new way of doing business for the long term.'

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (16): New man Smith administers
a tonic - Profile: General Motors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors, the world's largest vehicle manufacturer, is in the throes
of a painful transformation aimed at restoring its troubled North American
operations to health.
The group is battling to overcome decades of complacency, bureaucratic
encrustation and manufacturing inefficiency which culminated in combined
North American losses of over Dollars 12bn in the recession years of 1991
and 1992.
It was those losses, and the gradualist pace of change being pursued by
Robert Stempel, GM's then chairman and chief executive, which prompted a
boardroom coup in October 1992 and the installation of a new chief
executive, Jack Smith.
The 56-year-old Mr Smith who, in the 1980s, played a key role in turning
GM's European operations into the most profitable in that region, has moved
with equal vigour in the US over the past two years.
Jobs have been sharply cut in GM's plant and white collar bureaucracy. The
headcount of hourly paid workers had fallen from 329,000 at the end of 1990
to around 250,000, and analysts think it may be down to around 200,000 by
the end of 1996.
He has been selling off non-core businesses and shifting the supply of parts
for GM vehicles from its huge, in-house components operation to outside
suppliers, many of whom pay much lower wages and benefits to their workers.
He has also cracked down on outside parts suppliers, demanding from them
cuts of up to 20 per cent in the prices written into their contracts.
He has also swept away much of GM's in-bred 'old guard' top management,
bringing in a younger generation of leaders, such as Rick Wagoner, 41, the
recently appointed head of North American automotive operations.
All this, coupled with a cyclical recovery in the US vehicle market, has had
a strong impact on GM's earnings. In the second quarter, the group reported
best quarterly profits ever, of Dollars 1.92bn, more than double the Dollars
889m of a year earlier. North America contributed Dollars 723m to the bottom
line, compared with a Dollars 33m loss in the second quarter of 1993.
International operations, which for years have helped offset disaster in
North America, reported a Dollars 543m profit in the second quarter, up from
a Dollars 306m profit a year ago.
However, GM's North American vehicle profit margin, at 2.7 per cent of
revenues, still badly lagged behind its international automobile operations,
which posted a 7.5 per cent margin. GM's internal goal is 5 per cent.
GM earned an average of Dollars 557 for each vehicle it sold worldwide, up
from just Dollars 130 a vehicle a year ago, but well behind Ford, which
earned Pounds 653 a vehicle, and Chrysler, which made more than Pounds
1,300.
Mr Smith says: 'We recognise that we can't get complacent. We still have a
lot of work ahead to improve our earnings power and achieve target earnings
margins.'
It could face several stumbling blocks along the way. First, GM's crack-down
on suppliers prices, lead initially by the abrasive Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua, who then left GM for Volkswagen, has left relations between the
company and parts manufacturers extremely sore.
GM says the Lopez campaign saved it Dollars 4bn in cumulative purchasing
costs by the end of 1993, and that it has softened its abrasive edge. But
some suppliers complain it is still pressing them too hard, and showing
their engineering drawings to competitors, in the hope of getting lower
contract bids. GM, in short, has the worst relations with suppliers in
Detroit and over the long term that could hurt the company.
It also faces an extremely delicate relationship with the United Auto
Workers' union, which is anxious to retain industry jobs. The company has
suffered a rash of strikes at local plants, including a stoppage of 3,000
workers at an Indiana parts plant last summer.
However, behind the scenes, the UAW has been relatively co-operative with
GM's rationalisation, for example by not forcing the company to honour an
agreement that it will hire one new worker for every two who retire.
The biggest challenge facing the group is to start producing exciting new
vehicles that customers want to buy, rather than the tired, look-alike
models it churned out for much of the 1980s, and which cut its US market
share from around 46 per cent at the start of the decade to one third today.
There are some encouraging signs. For example, the new Aurora, a sporty
luxury sedan, should restore some shine to the badly tarnished Oldsmobile
badge. So too should the fact that the Aurora is being sold by dealers with
the same 'no haggle' techniques which helped make GM's compact, experimental
Saturn car a hit with buyers.
However, many of GM's other new vehicles have received a mildly
appreciative, rather than enthusiastic, critical reception. To win back
market share the group needs cutting edge appeal, and it does not seem there
yet.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (15): New lease of life for the
industrial dinosaurs - Martin Dickson finds recent market statistics
underline renewed international competitiveness in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are few more striking examples of US industry's renewed international
competitiveness than its motor companies, which just five years ago were
being written off as sclerotic industrial dinosaurs, doomed to cede an ever
larger share of the US market to Japanese rivals.
Today, Detroit's Big Three manufacturers - General Motors, Ford Motor and
Chrysler - have bounced back, or are in the process of doing so, although
fierce competition from Asian and European rivals means they cannot afford
any complacency.
Recent market statistics underline both this recovery and the see-saw
struggle for US market share:
In 1993, for the second year in a row, Japan's share of the US car and light
truck market fell, to 23.1 per cent from 24.3 per cent in 1992 and 25.7 per
cent in 1991. Detroit's share rose from 72.2 per cent to 73.9 per cent.
This year, however, both Japanese and European manufacturers have presented
a stronger challenge - notably in the car market, where they have clawed
back significant market share, although Detroit argues that this is partly
because of a shortage of products from the Big Three because of model
change-overs.
In the first eight months of 1994, Japanese name-plates accounted for 29.8
per cent of the car market, compared to 28.8 per cent in the same period of
1993, and Europe was up from 3.5 per cent to 4.3 per cent, led by a reviving
Volkswagen/Audi. Detroit's share slipped from 66.4 per cent to 64.4 per
cent.
For the car and light truck market as a whole, Detroit held a 73 per cent
share, down from 74.1, while Japan was on 23.4 per cent, up from 22.9, and
Europe at 2.7, against 2.2
Detroit's financial fortunes have also been helped by the turn in the US
economic cycle over the past two years, which has boosted demand for sales
and allowed manufacturers to cut back on costly rebates.
Vehicle sales dropped sharply in the 1991-92 recession and the car companies
fell into heavy losses, with inefficient GM alone losing Dollars 12bn in its
North American operations in just two years.
But over the past year profits at the Big Three have been rising sharply and
the industry is forecasting US car and truck sales in 1994 of 15.3m to 15.5m
units, up from 14.2m last year and 12.5m in 1991.
But Detroit cannot afford to relax. First, international competition remains
intense, and on some measures Detroit still lags behind its Japanese rivals.
Second, it remains uncertain just how far the upswing in the US market has
to go. Third, the US industry has yet to prove that it will not repeat its
past mistake of excessive complacency when the economy is buoyant, leaving
it ill-prepared it for the subsequent, inevitable downturn.
The Japanese, in particular, are still formidable competitors and their loss
of US market share is due in no small measure to the sharp rise in the value
of the yen relative to the dollar - a factor which could some day reverse
itself. For now, however, a substantial price gap has developed in the US
market between Japanese vehicles and similarly equipped US ones.
The Japanese are shifting more and more of their production to the US and
buying more parts in the country, both to protect themselves against yen
exposure and to ameliorate US protectionist sentiments.
The trend was underscored in early September when Toyota, the largest
Japanese manufacturer and the company feared most by Detroit, said it
planned to raise its North American vehicle production by nearly 50 per
cent. In July, Honda said it planned to spend Dollars 310m to expand its
North American operations.
European luxury car manufacturers are also setting up production plants in
the US: BMW has built a plant in South Carolina in order to make a sporty
new vehicle, both for the US and export markets, while Mercedes is
constructing a factory in Alabama to make its entrance into the fast-growing
sports utility vehicle sector.
Both have been drawn to the US by the size of its market, skills of its
labour force and its competitive manufacturing cost structure.
Exchange rate movements apart, several factors have helped Detroit claw back
market share from foreign rivals. First, it has sharply improved its
manufacturing productivity, though here it still lags somewhat behind the
North America plants of Japanese companies.
There are also substantial efficiency differences between the Big Three.
According to a recent report by Harbour &amp; Associates, a Detroit consultancy,
Ford's plants are the most productive of the trio, measured by workers per
vehicle produced, followed by Chrysler, with General Motors lagging well
behind. However, Chrysler more than makes up for the disadvantage with a
more efficient vehicle development process.
Chrysler completely changed the way it developed vehicles at the start of
this decade, setting up 'platform teams' to develop cars. These bring
together disciplines such as engineering and design to work simultaneously
on a problem, rather than 'throwing it over the wall' from one department to
another.
Chrysler has also set up close links with suppliers, which are brought early
into discussions about new models.
Ford and GM's relationships with suppliers are also in a state of flux. GM
stirred up intense hostility when Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua was
appointed worldwide head of purchasing in 1992 and began demanding large
price cuts from the group's parts suppliers.
He left GM in controversial circumstances to join Volkswagen last year, but
the group's relations with suppliers remains fragile.
Both Ford and GM are combining their US and European purchasing operations
in an attempt to cut costs, a course not open to Chrysler which has
virtually no overseas operations.
Each of the Big Three is also retreating from the industry's traditional
vertical integration, selling off parts operations and redistributing
contracts to outside companies with better expertise, fewer distractions and
lower labour costs.
The US recovery has also been helped by improvements in the past five years
in the quality of vehicles emerging from Detroit's plants. On the whole, the
quality still lags that of Japanese rivals, but the gap has narrowed to the
point where customers are prepared to place more weight on areas where the
Big Three do have an edge - in pricing and vehicle design.
Detroit, for example, has been ahead of the competition in exploiting a
fashion for mini-vans (multi-purpose vehicles or people carriers) and
four-wheel drive sports utility vehicles.
How long will the current US expansion continue? Over the summer a slow-down
in sales had some pessimists wondering whether it might already be
faltering.
But August saw a healthy 10 per cent year on year rise in vehicle sales and
most analysts think the upswing could have two to three more years to run.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (18): Radical steps pay off -
Profile: Chrysler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chrysler, the smallest of the big three US carmakers, has been rejuvenated
since the end of the 1980s by a far-reaching restructuring and a series of
highly successful new product launches.
Virtually written off as a serious competitor in the world industry at the
start of the 1990s, Chrysler is achieving record profits, and is being
regarded by rivals, including some Japanese carmakers, as a new benchmark
for global competitiveness in the world auto industry despite continuing
concerns about the quality of some of its cars.
Last year the group achieved a record pre-tax profit of Dollars 3.8bn, a
quadrupling from the Dollars 934m earned in 1992 and a big recovery from the
pre-tax loss of Dollars 910m suffered in 1991. Pre-tax profits in the first
half of 1994 jumped again by 57 per cent to a record Dollars 3.14bn.
Chrysler's reforms were driven by dire necessity, but Robert Eaton, group
chairman and chief executive, insists Chrysler was 'the first automaker to
recognise that basic changes were taking place in our industry, and we were
the first to prepare for them.
'We began by cutting costs and eliminating waste while preserving future
product spending. We sold non-automotive assets. And we began to get lean.
But as we trimmed our workforce, we also reorganised into (chassis) platform
teams that design cars faster and more efficiently.'
Chrysler learned much from the production systems of the Japanese carmakers,
and the lessons it has put into practice are commanding close attention in
Tokyo, where the Japanese car industry itself is under pressure to cut
costs.
Toyota has recently completed one of the most rigorous examinations it has
ever carried out of a competitor's car with a so-called 'tear-down' or
dismantling of Chrysler's Neon small family car to analyse its low-cost
construction. The leading Japanese carmaker was not complimentary about the
Neon quality levels, but it praised the way the engineering had been
simplified to cut cost.
According to Earl Hesterberg, vice-president of Nissan Motor in the US, the
Neon is forcing Japanese carmakers to wonder if some of their stringent and
costly quality measures are too high. 'It looks like they (Chrysler) did
some really smart things. We are all re-examining our product specifications
now.'
Faced by a renewed financial crisis at the end of the 1980s Chrysler was
forced to take radical steps to reform its organisation, and one of the keys
to its recovery has been the way it incorporates its suppliers into the
design, development and engineering process for new vehicles.
'We view our suppliers as an integral part of a value-added chain . . . we
call it the extended enterprise,' says Robert Lutz, Chrysler president. 'We
treat suppliers as fully-fledged members of our platform (individual car
range) teams. We have totally scrapped the old system of auctioning off
contracts to the lowest bidder. Instead we set an overall 'target cost' for
a given vehicle. And then we work with pre-selected 'supplier-partners' to
arrive at mutually agreed costs for that vehicle's parts and components.'
A study released earlier this year by Harbour &amp; Associates, the US
automotive analysts, claimed that Chrysler was the most profitable vehicle
maker in North America last year out-earning its nearest competitor by more
than Dollars 500 per vehicle.
Chrysler had the lowest total production costs of the five carmakers in
North America examined in the survey, which attributed Chrysler's lead to
dramatic improvements in product development costs, which had helped to
offset Ford's advantage in assembly costs.
The study showed that Chrysler's product development costs were Dollars 357
less per car than Ford's and Dollars 290 less than GM's, giving Chrysler a
big advantage when it launches new vehicles. Chrysler had also achieved
significant cost savings in particular in its assembly operations and
purchasing activities.
Despite the scale of the transformation there are still concerns that
Chrysler quality levels have yet to match its financial performance. The
group has introduced a series of new products in the past three years, but
it still lags behind the competition when it comes to defects per car and
customer satisfaction.
It failed to gain a single place in this year's list of top 10 cars for
initial vehicle quality compiled by JD Power, the leading US automotive
consumer research group. None of Chrysler's cars exceeded the industry
average.
In this year's new car customer satisfaction index all of the group's four
brand names Chrysler, Dodge, Plymouth and Eagle were below the industry
average, a position that contrasts sharply with its strong performance in
the light truck market, where it matches Toyota at the head of the league
table.
Its car operations have been troubled during the year by a series of product
recalls involving some of its newest vehicles. During the summer the company
formed a special group comprising its top 25 executives to seek solutions
and to focus on improving quality.
Despite the quality problems Chrysler has continued to perform strongly in
the US market. It increased its US car and light truck sales by 19.9 per
cent last year to 2.047m in a market that rose by 8 per cent. It raised its
market share to 14.7 per cent, the highest level for 23 years.
Chrysler is still overwhelmingly dependent on the North American market,
having been forced by an earlier financial crisis to sell most of its
foreign operations at the end of the 1970s. It is now aiming to double its
retail sales outside North America, however, to 200,000 by the end of the
decade. It increased sales outside North America by 45 per cent last year to
109,100 (including fleet and government sales) and exceeded 100,000 retail
sales for the first time since it re-entered international markets in 1987.
It is still a small player in foreign markets, but according to Tom Gale,
Chrysler vice-president of design and international operations, the company
is launching more new products in international markets in the next three
years than at any time in its history with the introduction of at least six
new left-hand drive and four new right-hand drive models by the beginning of
1997.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (12): Rude shock dealt to the
forecasters - The UK: after August's boom failed to materialise, the
confidence seen earlier this year has disappeared
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK motor trade and industry has entered this year's final quarter in a
state of unease and uncertainty.
In the first seven months of the year confidence was riding high. The UK new
car market was leading Europe out of recession faster than anyone had
predicted.
After their precipitate fall from the record 2.3m market that was achieved
in 1989 to 1.59m by 1992, registrations had recovered to 1.78m last year and
were up a further 14 per cent in this year's first half.
With the approach of August, the 'boom' sales month unique to the UK because
of its annual introduction of a new registration letter prefix, the Society
of Motor Manufacturers and Traders predicted August registrations could
reach 0.5m, matching a level that has no been seen since 1989.
To the industry's dismay, the boom did not materialise. August finished only
2.8 per cent ahead of last year at a mere 445,000 units.
It also became apparent that the increase had been fuelled entirely by the
company car sector making long-overdue replacements of its fleets. The
SMMT's own statistics showed that there were substantially fewer private
buyers in the market than in the previous year.
Manufacturers and importers have therefore found themselves approaching the
final quarter with unexpectedly high stocks, a renewed question mark over
the underlying strength of the UK economic recovery and a rude shock to the
already fragile consumer confidence that came in the form of the first rise
in UK interest rates for five years.
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has warned that more rises are in store if
inflation continues to edge upwards. To add to the last-quarter uncertainty,
there are no indications that this year's Budget, due in late November,
might contribute to the 'feelgood' factor so necessary for private motorists
to commit themselves to a new car purchase.
Against this background, the trade and industry has been retreating from
earlier forecasts that this year could see the UK return to a 2m-plus market
for the first time since 1990. Vauxhall, describing the recent interest rate
rise as 'unhelpful', has scaled back its own forecast to 1.92m.
Richard Ide, chief executive of Volkswagen/Audi's wholly-owned UK importer,
maintains, however, that his company 'never subscribed to the notion of a
half-a-million August'.
It expects a 1.9m market this year, rising only slightly to 1.95m in 1995
and points out that the 60,000 cars built for buyers who did not materialise
in August are going to leave market conditions extremely competitive for the
foreseeable future.
The German company, along with some other 'traditional' continental
importers such as Peugeot Citroen and Fiat, has substantially outperformed
the market this year, achieving unit sales gains of 23 per cent for Audi and
27 per cent - in large part a reflection of the greater freedom of choice
being given to company car drivers. 'The executive/luxury sector is holding
up well but it's almost all company money,' says Mr Ide.
There appears to be little sign of company car drivers handing back their
keys in a favour of a cash alternative - something which was widely
predicted in some quarters following several years of company car benefit
tax increases well above the rate of inflation and the adoption of a new tax
regime this year based on a simple percentage of new cars' list prices.
But where the new tax regime is having an effect is on the type of cars for
which company car drivers are opting. Many are settling for simpler cars
with fewer expensive options in order to reduce their personal taxation
burden. Manufacturers insist, however, that there are few examples of
drivers who have been entitled to an executive-level car opting for a much
smaller and cheaper one, plus top-up cash.
Meanwhile, most of the UK motor trade and industry is uniting to seek the
abolition of the August registration letter prefix system. Conceived in the
early 1960s, its declared aim was to help make the yearly sales pattern more
even, by reducing what was then an unwieldy sales peak at the start of each
calendar year. A useful proportion of buyers, the industry felt, would
prefer the perceived one-upmanship of having the latest number plate letter
in August.
The undeclared hope was that the 'keeping up with the Joneses' element of
the yearly letter would also sell more cars.
For many years, the system appeared to achieve both goals. Yet by the
mid-1980s the August sales bulge was already getting out of hand; far
eclipsing the January sales peak and coming to account for almost one
quarter of a full year's sales.
It meant that by as early as May of each year, the 'let's wait for the new
letter' syndrome was affecting sales. July, typically, now accounts for
little more than 2 per cent of the yearly total. Thus dealers' cash flow has
been dwindling at the very time that they need to acquire large stocks for
the August 'boom', drawing manufacturers as well into ever more complex and
costly stocking finance schemes.
Not least, dealer workshops have tended to be crammed with new cars being
prepared for delivery at the peak of the season - a factor hardly likely to
be in the interest of customers, either.
Finally, when August is over, the dealers face the problem of what to do
with the mountain of trade-ins.
In a recent poll commissioned by Automotive Management, more than 200
dealers voted six-to-one for the system to be scrapped. Most now appear to
believe that whatever extra sales may have been generated in the past, they
are no longer worth the market distortions caused.
According to Sewells International, the marketing monitoring group,
replacing the existing system with one spreading sales more evenly through
the year could save the industry almost Pounds 1.5bn in stocking and related
costs.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has set up a working party to
investigate alternative systems and to try and reach agreement within the
trade and industry on which one should finally be put forward to the
government.
It hopes to reach conclusions before the end of the year. More frequent
letter changes, the issue of a 'personal' registration plate to the driver,
and resurrecting a regional system are all coming under consideration.
The outcome of the debate will be watched with particular interest by
overseas car makers.
The August prefix system is unique to the UK. Without it, continental
Europeans in summer are interested in vacations, not buying new cars and
demand in continental Europe slumps accordingly. For Fiat, Peugeot,
Volkswagen and others, therefore, producing right-hand-drive cars for
Britain's August 'boom' is a valued way of keeping assembly lines flowing.
The UK car industry, however, is no longer an easy target for ambitious
importers. On the contrary, car production this year might well reach a
21-year high as the result of prolonged, steady improvement since the early
1980s - when annual output dipped briefly below 900,000.
Last year the UK industry produced 1.375m cars, a 6.4 per cent rise over a
year earlier. The rise in the first half of this year is much smaller, only
slightly more than 1 per cent (to 751,717).
However, this was largely a reflection of production for export being
affected by recession in the opening months of the year in continental
Europe's markets. With most of these markets now growing again, the upward
trend should shortly resume.
Most industry analysts suggest that production will break through the 2m
mark well before the end of the decade.
However, this performance would have been achieved by the motor industry in
Britain, not a British-owned industry. With the sale by British Aerospace of
Rover Group to BMW of Germany this year, only a handful of small specialist
companies such as Rolls-Royce and the Blackpool-based sports car
manufacturer, TVR, are UK-owned.
And most of the production expansion is being accounted for not by
old-established companies such as Ford (still UK market leader) and General
Motors' Vauxhall subsidiary, but the much more recent Japanese 'transplant'
factories.
Toyota started production of the Carine E (for Europe) upper-medium car
range at the beginning of last year. By year-end it had built 37,000. Output
jumped to 43,000 in this year's first half and industry analysts DRI
McGraw-Hill project nearly 91,000 this year, rising to 200,000 by 1997 - by
when, DRI predicts, Toyota will have introduced a second model, the smaller
Corolla, to the Burnaston lines.
Toyota has yet to confirm this; nor has it publicly given DRI any reason to
predict that Toyota's output will reach nearly 300,000 before the end of the
decade - well above the 200,000 capacity Toyota has so far indicated for the
plant.
However Honda, whose Swindon plant began producing the Accord upper-medium
saloon at the end of 1992, and which is also about to start producing the
smaller Civic, has already announced a Pounds 330m programme to expand
Swindon's output to 150,000 cars a year by the end of the decade, from the
100,000 expected in 1995.
Nissan, which made its decision to manufacture in the UK almost exactly 10
years ago, has also hinted that its current 200,000 capacity may be doubled
by the end of the decade.
It is unlikely that a similar announcement from Toyota will be very long
delayed.
Total Japanese output in the UK last year was 316,000 cars, 23 per cent of
the total. Of these 237,000 were exported - some 45 per cent of the UK
total.
However, while the output of Ford and Vauxhall has fallen back, Rover's
drive upmarket is continuing to pay it dividends. Expansion of its Land
Rover four-wheel-drive activities is proceeding apace, thanks to soaring
world-wide demand for its Discovery model, while a rash of new products in
the next 18 months will include Rover's version of the new Honda Civic, the
400; a new 200 hatchback, an MG sports car and a Metro replacement.
DRI, for one, believes that the various product programmes will see Rover
producing more than 500,000 cars a year by 1997, compared with 407,000 last
year.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (14): Optimists have upper hand
 -Spain: a subsidy scheme has helped push up sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Optimists about the Spanish car industry will point to this year's surging
sales figures, while pessimists will underline the traumas undergone by
Seat, the VW subsidiary and Spain's biggest producer, and by Santana, the
now all-but-bankrupt small company owned by Suzuki. But few in the domestic
industry doubt that the optimists have the day.
In the first eight months of this year car registrations in Spain rose 20.5
per cent on the January-August 1993 market total, well ahead of the European
Union average, to 555,000 units. The forecast is that the final 1994
registration figure will be about 900,000, comfortably up on last year
though short of the historic high of 1.1m cars registered in 1989 at the
height of Spain's growth period.
A key element in this rush for registrations has been a government programme
that, imitating a French initiative, pays owners of a 10-year-old car
Pta100,000 (Dollars 781) for trading in the vehicle for scrap to buy a new
one. Few government subsidy initiatives have met with such a ready response
from the public.
The so-called Renove programme was brought in for a six-month period which
expires this month and manufacturers, who say that it has accounted for some
70 per cent of the sales that have been made while it has been in operation,
are seeking to have the programme renewed for another six months.
The Renove incentive showed that attractive pricing can work wonders in what
is potentially a very large domestic market. Unsurprisingly, manufacturers
are lobbying the government to strike out a 13 per cent car tax on new
purchases which, when combined with the Value Added Tax that is levied on
vehicle acquisitions, places a 28 per cent tax burden on buyers.
Vehicle exports have also done well and stood at 73 per cent of total
production in the first half of this year, a ratio which is at least five
points up on what in recent years has been considered normal for Spain's
largest export-driven industrial sector.
Two factors have spurred sales outside Spain: the competitive peseta after
three devaluations of the national currency in 1992-93; and the increased
attraction, during times of recession, of the small and cheap cars in which
Spain specialises.
New markets outside the EU for Spanish cars - in eastern Europe, North
Africa and Latin America - are estimated to represent not much more than 5
per cent of the export total, though statistics may mislead since
Spanish-built Renault-5s, for example, which are nominally exported to
France, are likely to be re-exported.
The likelihood is that the emerging markets will sustain the momentum of
Spanish car exports when the EU recovery dampens the demand for small cars.
Nevertheless, most headlines about the domestic car industry have
concentrated on Seat and Suzuki.
Both firms are in trouble but neither is representative of the sector as a
whole, says Carlos Espinosa de los Monteros, president of Anfac, the Spanish
car manufacturers' federation.
Seat went through a traumatic period at the end of last year when its VW
parent announced the closure of its 30-year-old plant by the port of
Barcelona. However, this development had long been awaited, particularly as
VW had invested strongly in a new Seat facility outside Barcelona which will
probably be the last big car plant to be built in western Europe.
The new Seat plant at Martorell, north-west of Barcelona, says a great deal
more about VW's commitment to car production in Spain than does the messy
and emotionally-fraught closure of the historic, but obsolete, plant in
Barcelona's Zona Franca port area.
Suzuki was dragged into labour disputes early this year when it announced
that it would withdraw from the small Santana production centre that builds
Vitara four-wheel drive vehicles.
After a series of under-subscribed capital increases the Japanese giant,
which had entered Santana as a junior partner to provide technical support,
unwittingly found itself to be the virtual sole shareholder of a company
that it had no intention of owning.
The chief problems at Santana, which formerly manufactured Land Rovers and
was controlled by the UK's Rover group, are that it lacks a strong product
and is strapped for cash.
This is not a situation that on either count bears resemblance to any other
vehicle producer in Spain.
At present, the small Santana plant, based in the otherwise agricultural
town of Linares in the south and far from Spain's main industrial centres,
is fitfully building Vitaras and hoping that a Korean group will step in to
take up Suzuki's burden. The Japanese producer has already served notice
that it intends to pull out of Spain at the end of this year.
The other domestic car builders - Ford, General Motors, Renault, Citroen and
Nissan - are talking about the start of a new growth cycle. Anfac says that,
barring Suzuki, no foreign automobile group in Spain is even discussing
relocation elsewhere.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (13): Labouring in the slow
lane - Italy: Fiat is still shaking off effects of recent losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For evidence of how bad the past couple of years have been for the Italian
car market, you need only look at Fiat Auto, with its 44 per cent share.
In 1993, the company - which manufactures under six different brand-names,
including Fiat, Lancia, and Alfa Romeo - lost L1,745bn, after only breaking
even in 1992. The Fiat industrial group reported a record loss of L1,783bn
after tax and minority interests, reflecting its dependence on the
automotive business.
Not only was the state of the European car market grave, it was unexpected.
Gianni Agnelli, chairman of Fiat group, said in July that it was 'only
matched by the collapse in demand after the first oil shock 20 years ago'.
Signs of recovery in the Italian market are slower to appear than in the
rest of Europe. While deliveries in Europe rose an average of 6.6 per cent
in the first half of 1994, the number of units delivered to clients by
Italian distributors slipped 2.6 per cent to 1.058m, from 1.086m in the same
period, according to Anfia and Unrae, the Italian trade bodies for
automobile manufacturers and importers.
Italian car buyers are already punished by the high cost of petrol, and the
high level of taxes on new cars but in the first quarter of 1994 the market
was also hit by political uncertainty, ahead of the March general election.
Optimism after the victory of Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing alliance was
undermined by the new government's failure to clarify whether it would
introduce incentives for first-time car-buyers and existing owners wanting
to replace their vehicles.
Fiat claimed potential customers were holding back from buying because they
thought incentives could be round the corner. As Mr Agnelli observed tartly
at the group's annual meeting in July, car sales in France and Spain - both
had enacted measures to improve demand - increased substantially in the
first five months of the year.
In the past couple of months, however, better news has begun to filter
through from the market. Official statistics in Italy are notoriously
sluggish to emerge, but projections from the ministry of transport indicated
that registrations in August increased, compared with the equivalent period
last year, sustaining a year-on-year monthly increase.
Promotor, an independent car industry research group based in Bologna,
observed in September that the faint signs of a general Italian economic
recovery were beginning to stimulate the car market.
Some 58 per cent of Italian dealers polled by Promotor at the end of August
said the level of orders was normal or high, compared with only 20 per cent
in June, and 29 per cent in July. Only 16 per cent of dealers thought demand
would drop over the next three or four months. Consumers, cajoled by
aggressive autumn promotions, may now go ahead with purchases which were
postponed for the first two-thirds of the year. Fiat, in particular, has put
much promotional weight behind its new Punto small car, Italy's best-seller.
However, there are plenty of reasons to be cautious about the statistical
evidence. The main one being that the figures may be distorted by the high
proportion of 'parallel exports' from Italy to other countries where prices
are generally higher.
Until two years ago, it was Italians who slipped across the border to buy up
to 50,000 or 60,000 cars a year from dealers in neighbouring countries.
After the September 1992 devaluation of the lira, however, it is Italy which
is benefiting from the bargain-hunting traffic, officially discouraged by
the car distributors.
'At the moment, prices are much lower than in the rest of Europe, possibly
by as much as 15 or 16 per cent,' says Gian Primo Quagliano, director of
Promotor. 'But with discounts offered by dealers and intermediaries, that
can rise to more than 20 per cent.'
He estimates that out of some 1.9m sales likely to be recorded this year by
Italian dealers, as many as 250,000 could be accounted for by parallel
exports, compared with 150,000 in 1993. 'Sales are roughly at the same level
as last year, but this total is made up of internal demand, which is still
cautious, compensated by (parallel) exports,' says Mr Quagliano.
Fiat Auto, which is pressing the transport ministry for more efficient
statistical information about the Italian market, warns that some parallel
exports may be counted twice, as registrations for Italy and the final
country of destination.
Parallel exports are still sales, however, and the currency devaluation has
undoubtedly benefited Italian manufacturers, even on the home market. For
example, the strong yen has discouraged Japanese imports, further shielding
Fiat and its main European and US competitors on the Italian market, from
the likely effects of full liberalisation of the European Union car sector
in 1999.
In the first half of the year, Italian car-makers (that is mainly Fiat, plus
some specialist manufacturers) accounted for 45.89 per cent of the total
number of cars delivered, according to the Anfia/Unrae statistics  - an
increase of more than 1 percentage point on their market share in the first
half of 1993.
Fiat group is forecasting a return to overall profit in 1994. But Fiat Auto
is still relatively pessimistic about its home territory. 'For us the
Italian market isn't showing any signs of recovery. Although we have had one
or two months where sales have increased the trend generally this year is
static,' says Fiat.
For Fiat Auto's Italian operations - and, by extension, for the Italian car
market as a whole - the real recovery will not be felt until 1995.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of New Broadcast and Communication Media (12):
Germans act on media control - An owner's total share of the television
audience will be limited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CALLAM MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After months of bitter internecine feuding, Germany's 15 regional media
authorities last week recommended a radical set of reforms to regulations
which are supposed to guard against the building up of ownership
concentrations in the commercial television sector.
At present, restrictions are placed on the size of shareholdings and the
number of channels in which an owner has an interest. Different rules apply,
depending on whether a channel has been awarded a 'full service' or a
'thematic' licence.
This complex system is to be replaced by one in which the total share of the
television audience gained by the channels in which an owner has an interest
is limited to 25 per cent. The basis of media ownership regulation,
according to one television executive, will be switched to one of 'how many
people watch the channels, not how many channels you own'.
In the UK the lack of such a regulatory framework has led to the development
of a satellite broadcasting market which is largely controlled by BSkyB.
Germany's post-war federal structure was designed to ensure that the media
can never again fall into the hands of any single political or commercial
organisation.
Yet existing regulations have not prevented privately-owned commercial
television from being dominated by three big media groups, each with stakes
in a number of channels: Bertelsmann, Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de
Telediffusion and the Kirch Group.
Germany's two public service broadcasters, ARD and ZDF, are in decline
through overmanning, political sensitivities over the licence fee and fierce
restrictions on the amount of advertising time available to them. The
country has developed the largest cable network in Europe, with 14m homes
already connected. In addition, about 7m homes have satellite receivers.
The consequence has been a scramble in recent years to exploit the enormous
advertising potential of the united Germany by starting new commercial
channels. This has been encouraged by Germany's federal regulatory system,
which devolves the licensing of channels to the regional media authorities.
Lacking a nationally agreed licensing policy, and fearful of being accused
of driving away investment and jobs from their own region, the authorities
have mostly been prepared to grant a broadcasting licence to anyone that
applies for one.
And if one authority will not grant a licence - for instance because it
believes the shareholding in a proposed channel leads to a concentration of
media ownership - another authority can usually be found that will. Once the
channel is licensed, the other authorities must accept it, even if they
disagree with the award.
But even the new simplified formula for limiting media ownership
concentration will not solve all of the authorities' regulatory problems.
For instance, the Kirch Group is engaged in a long-running dispute with most
of the media authorities over the ownership of the Pro 7 film channel, which
is 47.5 per cent owned by Mr Thomas Kirch, son of Mr Leo Kirch, the group
president. Most authorities believe the channel should be seen as belonging
to the Kirch media empire.
Under current regulations, this would mean that Kirch's stake in the channel
would have to be pruned to below 25 per cent, since an owner may hold more
than 25 per cent of just one full-service channel - and this quota has
already been achieved through its 43 per cent stake in Sat1. But the son
argues that his interest in Pro 7 is independent of the Kirch Group, and
should not be counted as part of its holdings.
This dispute has been running for over a year, despite the efforts of the
Direktorenkonferenz der Landesmedienanstalten, a regular meeting of the
directors of the 15 authorities, which has held several inconclusive votes
in an attempt to resolve it.
The publication of the authorities' new proposals is likely to intensify the
dispute. If the Kirch Group were to lose its case, adding Pro 7 to its
channel portfolio would take its audience share above the limit - the only
media group to be so affected.
In a section clearly aimed at Pro 7, the authorities attempt to address the
question of ownership identity by recommending that the media authorities
should be given powers equivalent to the German monopolies and mergers
commission, the Kartellamt, to investigate the real influences at work
within a channel. It warns that the question of 'relationships' should be
treated with particular caution.
The proposed changes will contribute to a detailed parliamentary review of
the state broadcasting treaty. If accepted, they could become law by January
1996.
Bertelsmann, Kirch and CLT are already organising their defences.
Bertelsmann has issued a statement claiming that it is unfair that a channel
in which it has an interest should count equally towards the calculation of
its overall audience share, regardless of the size of the stake.
But the authorities have three big advantages on their side. For once, they
are said to be unanimous; they have support from politicians of both the
left and the right; and they are likely to be backed up by the EU, which is
also considering legislation based on the so-called 'audience share model'.
With this muscle behind them, the authorities could, at last, be about to
curb the power of Germany's media giants.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of New Broadcast and Communication Media (13):
Salvation sought from US - Multi-media offers hope of a Japanese electronics
revival
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
To the bureaucrats in the deep, dark halls of Kasumigaseki, where Japan's
ministries are concentrated, the idea of a national information
infrastructure, first proposed by US Vice-President Al Gore, must have
seemed inspired.
For the past few years, as the country's leading corporations suffered
falling profits, business leaders and bureaucrats have been hard-pressed to
come up with a solution to reviving the slumping economy.
The consumer electronics and car industries, which until recently had been
significant engines of growth, are deemed unlikely to assume that role
again, if and when the recession ends. The recovery in these industries,
where demand has matured, is expected to be gradual and mild.
As the yen's sharp appreciation has forced consumer electronics companies to
move more production to lower-cost regions and encouraged car makers to
localise manufacturing, their impact in spurring domestic growth is likely
to be subdued.
An information superhighway, as proposed by Mr Gore, is increasingly seen as
providing the best answer to boosting economic growth. To the delight of the
bureaucrats, it has all the ingredients of a grand national project:
potentially enormous social benefits for a wide public, regulatory
implications, capacity to provide large numbers of jobs, huge investment
spending and an opportunity for industrial policy-making.
The plan, according to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, is to
have fibre-optic cable laid throughout the country by the year 2010, for
Japan's very own information superhighway. This will probably (more likely
than not) be the job of NTT, the telecommunications company that is 66 per
cent owned by the government.
The MPT forecasts that by that time the market for multimedia - the
convergence of consumer electronics, computing and telecommunications which
will spur demand for using the advanced information infrastructure - will be
worth Y123 trillion and employ 2.4m people. For its part, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry calculates that in six years multimedia
will grow into a market worth up to Y70 trillion, or 5.9 per cent of total
GNP.
'The source of economic value is shifting from manufacturing activity to
intellectual activity,' Miti said in a report on its advanced information
technology programme published in May. But since Japan has been relatively
slow to make use of advances in information technology, much more needs to
be done before the country can reap the benefits of the new information age.
Indeed, compared with the US, Japan appears still to live in the stone age
of information technology. Bringing the country into line with the US will
be a formidable task.
Take computers and cable TV, for example, which are expected to play a
significant role in the spread of multimedia in the US. While PC penetration
is 42 per cent in the US, it is only about 10 per cent in Japan, says Mr
David Kellar, an analyst at IDC, the information technology consultancy. And
while 66 per cent of PCs in the US are hooked up to local area networks, the
figure drops to just 17 per cent in Japan, according to Miti.
The situation is similar for cable TV with only 4.5 per cent of Japanese
homes connected to cable networks, compared with over 60 per cent in the US.
Without greater penetration of such equipment and networks, and a greater
familiarity among potential users with such advanced communications and
broadcasting services, the expensive network of fibre-optic cable which the
MPT wants to see built could be wasted.
'The MPT has announced ambitious plans for investment in multimedia, but it
has not considered sufficiently whether the equipment will actually be
bought by consumers,' worries Mr Tsuzo Murase, executive vice president of
Matsushita.
Mr Murase is concerned that Japanese consumers have not had sufficient
experience with data networks, for example, to make use of all the fancy new
services that would become available through multimedia. 'Access to networks
has to be made much easier,' he notes.
Similar doubts exist with respect to the new kinds of services that
multimedia is expected to generate.
'No matter how much technology advances, what matters is whether there is a
use for that technology,' says Mr Akira Kuwahara, vice president of Toshiba.
Like many other executives in the Japanese electronics industry, Mr
Kuwahara, lacks confidence in Japan's ability to come up with creative uses
for multimedia.
Although Japanese companies have the skills to make the advanced hardware
that multimedia will require, the country lacks an environment that can
nurture the creative talent and entrepreneurial spirit needed to spawn the
software and services that will make multimedia practical and stimulate
demand for its use.
'Toshiba is staffed by people who wear blue business suits and graduated
from the science, technology and law departments of universities. If you go
to the Time Warner offices in California, people wear black suits with long
hair tied back in a pony-tail and have studied things we've never heard of,'
he exclaims. 'The vitality in the US is extraordinary.'
Japan lacks a dynamic software industry, such as Hollywood; the mobility of
talent that is found in the US, which is crucial to generating new ideas for
new businesses, is lacking in Japan. 'That is Japan's handicap,' says Mr
Kuwahara.
At the same time, deregulation of the information and telecommunications
sectors will be crucial to creating an environment in which such new
services can thrive.
The bureaucrats also recognise the many obstacles that Japan faces in
becoming an advanced information society. 'In Japan, the problem is that
compared with the hardware, high quality contents and applications have not
been supplied sufficiently,' Miti states. 'In order to develop multimedia
software, it is important to nurture talented people who can combine
creative expression with information processing skills.'
The bureaucrats' solution is to set up pilot experiments in multimedia,
encourage its use in public institutions such as town halls, hospitals and
schools, and gradually build a base for the spread of new multimedia
services.
Businesses have a more short-term answer. To overcome the disadvantages
Japan faces, 'we need to tie up with those who have what we don't have,'
Toshiba's Mr Kuwahara says. Toshiba already has a stake in Time Warner,
which gives it an entry into the emerging US multimedia market.
Other electronics companies as well as NTT, the telecommunications company,
have been busy in forging links with US software companies from start-ups
such as 3DO to well-established giants such as Microsoft.
The pace may be much slower in Japan than in the US, but as such moves
gather pace, MPT says, 'the year 1994 can be considered the first of the
Multimedia Era'.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (11): Doubts persist on
resilience of recovery - France: government incentives have helped the
industry but celebrations are muted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French car industry has turned the corner after the black year of 1993,
boosted by special government incentives for car buyers and a revival in the
French and European economies. Monthly sales figures so far this year have
generally recorded double-digit rises, providing a stimulus for broader
economic growth.
The two giants of the industry, PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault, are both on
course for healthy increases in results for 1994 and are benefiting from
revamped product ranges. At Renault, the outlook has been helped by last
month's announcement that the government will partially privatise the
state-owned company, an operation which will be accompanied by a FFr2bn
capital increase.
Despite such uplifting factors, however, there is only muted celebration at
the headquarters of the French car manufacturers. Doubts persist about the
resilience of the recovery, while the structural problems in the European
industry have been masked, rather than resolved, by economic revival. In
France, government measures to boost sales, including a premium of FFr5,000
to car buyers who trade in a vehicle more than 10 years old to buy a new
one, have had a temporary, if significant, effect. For Renault, there are
additional question-marks about its longer-term strategy after the collapse
at the end of last year of its plans to merge with Volvo.
Jacques Calvet, Renault's chairman, expressed the general caution at the
recent launch of a new version of the company's Xantia mid-range car.
Predicting an increase of about 4 per cent in Europe's car market this year,
he said that was still 'bad when you realise that 1993 brought a drop of
about 15 per cent on 1992'.
As for France, he said: 'I am not so pessimistic as at the end of July, but
I do not hold with the forecasts of a French market of 2m cars in 1994.'
For the Peugeot boss, and for most industry observers, the French market
should nevertheless see a healthy rise this year. 'I think we will see a
rise of about 12 or 13 per cent to just over 1.9m units,' says one analyst
at a French merchant bank.
That kind of improvement should lead to earnings growth at the French
manufacturers. Peugeot Citroen is on course to bounce back to profits after
a net loss of FFr1.41bn in 1993. In addition to improved market conditions,
the company has been implementing productivity measures and reducing its
debt burden. Net debts are forecast to fall to about FFr10bn at the end of
the year, compared with FFr16.7bn at the end of 1993.
The improved competitiveness of its range - which has seen the introduction
of the 106 and 306 models and, more recently, its passenger van rivals to
the Renault Espace - is also shown in market share figures. In the first
eight months of 1994, the Peugeot group captured 12.7 per cent of the
European market, compared with 12 per cent in the same period last year.
At Renault, already one of Europe's most profitable car manufacturers, the
current year will also see a strong rise in earnings. First-half results
announced last month revealed net profits of FFr1.7bn, more than double the
figures in the comparable 1993 period.
The results were flattered by the impact of exceptional gains from the sale
of shares in Volvo, Renault's erstwhile merger partner. They also masked a
decline in operating profit, partly reflecting the lower margins of entry
level models favoured by the government's incentives. For the full year,
however, both Renault and industry analysts expect a strong improvement in
the bottom line.
Part of this will come from improved international sales. Like Peugeot,
Renault has been extending its tentacles into emerging markets in eastern
and central Europe and Latin America.
Like its domestic rival, Renault has benefited from a revamped model range.
The Twingo, the popular mini-car, has helped restore its reputation for
innovation. The Safrane has strengthened the company's position at the
opposite end of the market.
The question marks over the state-owned group relate more to its longer-term
strategy in the wake of its failed alliance with Volvo. The spectacular
collapse of merger plans at the end of last year deprived Renault of
significant cost savings from economies of scale and the sharing of design
costs and components. This was a particularly important factor with respect
to RVI, its trucks and buses subsidiary.
Since the departure of Volvo, the centre-right government of Edouard
Balladur has indicated that industrial partners need to be found before
Renault can be privatised. The state will retain a stake of at least 51 per
cent following Renault's forthcoming flotation, due to be held by the end of
the year. The implication is that Renault's future must be guaranteed in the
increasingly competitive car industry before it can be released to the
threats of private sector predators.
For the time being, Renault is pursuing a strategy of specific targeted
alliances, rather than a grand partnership a la Volvo. Thus, it has recently
concluded an agreement with Iveco, Fiat's truck subsidiary to co-operate on
the design and development of cabins, while rejecting the merger of its
foundry facilities with those of the Italian group. It already has extensive
co-operation agreements with Peugeot for the development of components.
Speculation is bound to continue, however, about the formation of bigger
alliances. That is unlikely to deter potential investors in Renault,
particularly given the restricted supply of shares in its forthcoming
flotation.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (10): Transplants step up
exports - At least 1m Japanese cars will be built in Europe by 2000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS

<TEXT>
Toyota, Nissan and Honda between them will account for one-third of the UK's
annual car production by the year 2000, or 650,000 units, Koichiro
Yoshizawa, Honda's former chairman, predicted during a recent visit to
London. By then, he maintained, they will have spent a total of Pounds 2.2bn
on their UK facilities and be employing 10,000 people.
There is reason to think that Mr Yoshizawa was being conservative. Nissan is
already committed to 300,000 capacity but has hinted that 400,000 could be
the goal by the end of the decade.
Honda has committed to 150,000 by the late 1990s but is keeping long-term
options open on a move to 200,000. Toyota has already reached its phase one
production rate of 100,000 cars a year with just one car, the Carina; is
expected to add the smaller Corolla, and will almost certainly be producing
200,000 cars or more from its Burnaston plant in Derbyshire by the end of
the decade.
That is by no means the end of the Japanese manufacturing presence in
Europe.
Next spring, NedCar a joint venture between Mitsubishi Motors, the Dutch
government and Volvo of Sweden, is to start producing up to 200,000
lower-medium sized cars at the radically modernised former Volvo BV plant at
Born in southern Holland. One half of the output will be badged as
Mitsubishis, the other Volvos.
Both Nissan and Suzuki have production operations in Spain, capable of
contributing nearly 150,000 vehicles a year to Japanese production in
Europe, although both have run into difficulties.
Meanwhile Suzuki has done a deal with Subaru, part of Fuji Heavy industries,
under which Suzuki will build up to 12,000 four-wheel-drive cars a year at
the Hungarian plant at which Suzuki already makes its Swift
front-wheel-drive car. The 4wd vehicles will be badged as Subarus, with
deliveries starting next year. Swifts have been rolling off the Magyar
Suzuki assembly line for about a year now at Esztergom, 40km north of
Budapest.
Even allowing for the Spanish problems, then, it is likely that at the end
of the decade at least 1m Japanese cars a year will be in production in
Europe. Additionally, Japanese cars are finding their way into Europe's
markets from the US or from Japan itself.
However, the long-standing fear of the European motor industry - and the
expectation of many industry analysts - that Japanese carmakers, with their
standard-setting quality, would inexorably drive the Europeans into endless
retreat now look much exaggerated. One reason is the soaring yen, which has
made Japanese producers lose competitiveness. But more important in terms of
the Japanese transplants, there has been a strong product fight-back by
indigenous European producers.
Whatever the pros and cons of this debate, while total new car sales in
Europe rose by 6.8 per cent in this year's first half compared with the same
period a year ago, sales by Japanese carmakers fell by 5.8 per cent. Their
market share stands at about 11 per cent compared with 12.4 per cent a year
ago.
The setback provides no grounds for complacency. The European industry
expects Japan to regroup and Nissan, for one, is already revising its
approach to the European market, with more frequent facelifts now planned
for its models than is the norm in Japan.
Nissan, Japan's second-largest vehicle maker, began production at Sunderland
in 1986 and had built up production to 175,000 units a year by 1992. Last
year's output had been scheduled to reach 270,000 as the Micra small car
joined Primera production. However, with the UK market weaker than expected
and a steep downturn then under way in continental Europe, Nissan was
obliged to trim its sails and output levelled off at 246,000.
Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK) managing director Ian Gibson says that
current output rates are about 220,000 units a year. He refuses to predict
what this year's total production might be.
Despite the problems, Nissan - which has won the Queen's Award for Exports
for three years in succession - emerged as the leading UK car exporter last
year, outstripping Rover group, Ford and Vauxhall. Indeed, the Japanese
transplants last year accounted for three of the top six places as UK car
exporters. Seventy-four per cent of Sunderland's output was exported.
A few weeks ago Honda, Japan's third largest car maker, announced plans to
increase by 50 per cent the capacity of its Swindon plant in south-west
England to 150,000 a year by the late 1990s. This will raise direct
employment by 500 to 2,500 and lift Honda's total investment in the Swindon
facilities to Pounds 700m, according to Kazue Ito, president of Honda Motor
Europe.
Production of a second model, the Civic, is just getting under way at
Swindon alongside the larger Accord range with which the plant went on
stream at the beginning of last year. The car will go on sale in some parts
of southern Europe in December, in Germany in January and in the UK in
March.
The Civic, which replaces the Concerto model which Rover had been building
for Honda on its Longbridge lines, is intended to lift Swindon's annual
output to 100,000 next year. If all goes to Honda's plan, Swindon will thus
provide about half the 300,000 cars a year Honda is hoping to be selling by
the end of the decade.
Honda plans to sell about 60,000 of the Civics in Europe next year, and
describes the car as the most important it has ever launched in Europe. The
sales target appears modest beside the 200,000 a year that Rover intends to
build of its version of the Civic, the Rover 400.
Rover is producing the 400 - which will look markedly different from the
Civic - under licence from Honda, continuing collaboration put in place
before Rover's sale to BMW by British Aerospace and the subsequent
dismanting of cross shareholdings between Honda and Rover.
Honda, initially dismayed and angered by the sale of its UK partner to BMW,
is taking a pragmatic stance about its European future.
Fears that the Japanese would simply build 'screwdriver' plants in Europe
with minimal local content have long since disappeared. Nissan, admittedly
the longest-established in the UK, already has 83 per cent European content,
makes its own engines and even has its own foundry to produce castings. The
latest, Pounds 30m investment is in a facility at Sunderland to produce
axles. The only major component still to come from Japan is the gearbox.
Indeed, exports of components produced in the UK for the transplants is also
on the increase. Toyota's Pounds 140m engine plant at Deeside, Clwyd, is
beginning to supply a new car assembly plant in Turkey as well as the UK
production lines. Several UK and continental-owned suppliers to Burnaston
are also seeing their components being exported to Japan itself.
Japan and the EU agreed three years ago to set annual EU-wide import quotas,
to be reassessed every six months, to pave the way for a completely open
European car market by the end of the decade. As part of this agreement,
restrictions which had previously been imposed by individual member states
became null and void.
In view of the resumption of sales growth in Europe, Japan was planning to
seek a bigger quota for car exports to the EU at the latest of the
six-monthly talks between officials of the European Commission and the
Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, in Brussels on
September 29 and 30.
Inevitably, there were likely to be robust discussions while forecasts were
compared. But so far, the monitoring system seems to be functioning fairly
well.

Testing ground gets busy - The Polish media market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN DONALD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Large forces are again massing to divide up Poland. This time, however, the
opposing sides are some of the biggest media companies in Europe.
Poland is itself a considerable prize, already being the third-largest
market, after Germany and the UK, with at least 1.5m dish television homes.
Another million are connected to cable. It is also seen as a testing ground
for how well other central and eastern European countries will respond to
new media offerings. The passage this year of copyright legislation, which
will help distributors and programmers fight the endemic piracy, is another
attraction.
The M-Net/Richemont pay-television operator FilmNet and the distributor
MultiChoice Poland, a joint venture between Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Datacom
and Nethold, are launching services there this month as a prelude to
entering neighbouring states.
MultiChoice, which has the rights to distribute News Datacom's VideoCrypt II
decoder system, is offering Polish homes a package comprising the Children's
Channel, the Adult Channel, Country Music Television, the home shopping
service QVC, and FilmNet, a premium film channel with a small amount of
sports and music.
However, Poland's National Radio and Television Council intends to regulate
foreign operators beaming into Poland by seeking legislation this autumn to
let it license decoder distribution. It wants foreign channels to adhere to
at least some of its media regulations, such as carrying a certain amount of
Polish programming or respecting the 33 per cent limit on foreign ownership
of channels. The council could stop the channels being carried on cable.
The package will, any way, face stiff competition. The unlicensed
terrestrial broadcaster Polonia 1 launched an advertising-supported,
unencrypted channel last month on Eutelsat. The channel's 12 regional
stations (six of which were closed by the authorities in August) had built a
substantial following, with its soaps and films attracting a 25 per cent
viewing share.
Another possible satellite competitor could be a Compagnie Luxembourgeoise
de Telediffusion RTL-7 channel. However, plans for the unencrypted
entertainment service ran into difficulties in July after potential partners
Reuters and Polish investors rejected the CLT's business plan. Licences have
been granted this year for the first national terrestrial commercial station
and three regional commercial networks.
Almost every leading media operator made a bid for the national licence. It
went to the all-Polish Polsat, which started out as a Eutelsat channel. Mr
Murdoch had hoped to take a stake in the company, but so far it remains
completely Polish. But viewers have not been impressed and it typically
gains a lower viewing share than Polonia 1.
Some of the disappointed bidders joined the second round of licensing. Canal
Plus won licences to run a pay channel in the big cities and plans to offer
the film-based service available in France. It will cost Dollars 60m to
Dollars 100m to launch and will charge subscribers Dollars 12 a month. The
NTP Plus consortium, backed by Central European Media Enterprises, won
licences for north and central Poland, while Wisla, backed by Kinnevik, won
licences for the south.
The FilmNet and MultiChoice channels will be launched in November in the
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia and possibly Croatia. Russia,
Romania, Bulgaria and the Ukraine may follow. MultiChoice is negotiating to
add MTV, VH-1, Nickelodeon and the Family Channel to its package.
In the Czech Republic, it will face substantial western competitors. The
US-backed Central European Media Enterprises holds a licence for a satellite
channel. United International Holdings of the US, which is merging its
European cable networks with those of the Dutch company Philips, plans to
roll out a 16-channel microwave multipoint distribution system network in
Prague, Brno and Tabor in the autumn as a prelude to laying a cable system.
It will also start three channels this autumn, a premium film channel and
two basic tier services, one for children and the other combining general
entertainment with documentaries. It may also launch a basic tier film
channel, showing popular films from the 1960s to 1980s. The channels would
be offered to other Czech cable operators and could also be distributed in
Slovakia, where UIH has set up a joint venture with the Slovak National
Cable Television Company to acquire multi- channel television systems. So
far, it has 44,000 subscribers.
UIH is in the process of expanding elsewhere in central Europe. It is
pursuing franchises covering 1.4m of the 2.6m television homes in Bulgaria
and plans to expand its stake in the Hungarian Kabelkom cable operator,
which has 212,800 subscribers. It has set up a joint venture with the
Romanian state-owned electrical installation company Imsat, which has cable
TV projects covering 44,000 homes and is seeking licences for a further
100,000.
For the region as a whole, an encouraging development is that the European
Bank of Reconstruction and Development, which took a Pounds 2.6m 14.8 per
cent stake in UIH's Prague Kabel Net company, is looking at cable proposals
in Estonia, Slovakia and Poland. The EBRD can take a maximum one-third stake
in a company.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of New Broadcast and Communication Media (9): BSkyB
fights back - Interview with Sam Chisholm, chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Sam Chisholm, the tough chief executive of British Sky Broadcasting, is
in a typically pugnacious mood. 'ITV is going to run out of sand to stick
their heads in,' he says. Mr Chisholm is referring to the fact that the ITV
companies finance a regular independent survey of the satellite market by
GfK, the market research group, whose findings in recent months have
suggested that dish sales have slowed down and that BSkyB is running out of
steam. 'We will let the results speak for themselves. We will just keep on
and on,' he insists.
There is no easy way to bridge the gap between the BSkyB numbers and those
produced by GfK. The research group says, for instance that dish sales
slumped to 20,000 in May despite an offer in April and May in which Sky
Television services were on free trial. BSkyB says more than 100,000 dishes
were supplied under the scheme and only around 10 per cent returned.
'There is no evidence that it (demand for dishes) is slackening off,' says
Mr Chisholm, who adds that total sales this year should be around 1m,
roughly the same as last year and the year before that. In August BSkyB, a
consortium in which Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has a 50 per cent
stake and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has 17.5 per cent, did give
hard numbers to City analysts when the satellite company announced results
for the year to June 1994.
Group profits before interest rose to Pounds 185.8m and profit going to
shareholders to help pay off the more than Pounds 1.5bn invested rose from
Pounds 54.1m in 1993 to Pounds 176.8m. Charts based on the company's own
figures show that weekly dish sales for the year to June did not drop below
11,000 and reached a pre-Christmas peak of more than 36,000 and that the
number of subscribers grew in a relatively straight line from about 250,000
in December 1989 to 3.45m by the end of June 1994.
In its latest financial year BSkyB said its subscriber base increased by
1.1m - a rise of 46 per cent, the numbers of subscribers taking both movie
channels and the sports channel growing by 750,000. Out of the total of
3.45m subscribers, 74 per cent were watching on individual dishes, 18 per
cent were connected to modern cable networks and a further 8 per cent came
from communal aerials and other 'bulk subscriptions'.
BSkyB is Europe's leading satellite subscription television service - though
the terrestrial subscription service of Canal Plus is still ahead in numbers
with 3.7m subscribers. In the past two years, however, BSkyB has been living
dangerously. In September 1993 the company began to scramble an extended
package of basic channels so that only those who paid Pounds 6.99 a month
subscription were able to watch. At the time a raft of non-BSky-B channels
such as MTV, Bravo, UK Living, UK Gold and The Discovery Channel came into
the Sky Multi-Channels package. The total cost of subscribing to them all
was Pounds 19.99 a month.
Last month BSkyB announced a Pounds 3 a month price rise which went equally
on every form of subscription package. So though it now costs Pounds 22.99 a
month to get all the BSkyB channels. the Pounds 3 increase has also been
imposed on Sky Multi-Channels, a rise of 43 per cent. To sweeten the pill,
the price rise has been accompanied in the past few days by the launch of
five new services: VH-1, the music television channel aimed at 25-49 year
olds; a second Sky Sports channel, only at the weekends; four hours a day of
soaps; a travel channel produced for Sky by Thames Television; and a daytime
slot for The Learning Channel from cable which will share a transponder with
Discovery, the factual and documentary channel that will take over at 4pm.
Of the additions, only VH-1, a channel aimed at the UK market and like MTV
owned by Viacom of the US, is a full 24-hour channel. If BSkyB can hold onto
its existing subscribers at the new rates and add to the total, then the
1994-95 profits could be substantially higher than this year's.
It is unlikely that the extra cost of the modest increase in programme
services will be anything like the increased subscription revenues. 'There
is absolutely no objection to the price rise,' claims Mr Chisholm who adds
that another seven channels could be on the way once the fourth Astra
satellite is launched at the end of this month.
The new channels are likely to be a mixture of pay-per-view films plus a
number of other non-movie channels. Inevitably, they will further fragment
the audience in cable and satellite homes, underlining the fact that
satellite television is a business built not on ratings but on the number of
subscribers paying for additional choice.
More than 82 per cent of BSkyB's revenues at the moment come from
subscriptions, though advertising revenues rose from Pounds 43.8m in 1992 to
Pounds 78.1m in 1994. Despite a doubling of channel choice available, the
overall share of viewing to the new media has not changed greatly in cable
and satellite homes.
According to official Barb ratings the share of viewing of the new channels
has varied between 28 per cent and a high of 36 per cent when exclusive Test
Match cricket from the West Indies cricket was being shown. And apart from
Sky 1, viewing to the new channels tends to be dominated by movies, sport,
cartoons and the library channel UK Gold, with some of the specialised,
thematic channels attracting average weekly viewing figures of less than 15
minutes.

Publishers tap into global network - The potential of Internet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Internet, a global 'network of computer networks' linking an estimated
30m computer users, and the forerunner to the much ballyhooed 'information
highway' is creating both opportunities and challenges for traditional
publishers.
Unlike commercial 'on line' information services such as Compuserve, Prodigy
and America On Line, that charge users either according to the amount of
time spent accessing the service or the number of documents read, the
Internet is largely unmonitored.
Any 'information' - be it the text of a novel, the price of stocks or
articles from a newspaper or magazine - that is accessible via the Internet
is essentially in the public domain, free to anyone who can figure out how
to find it in the vast unmapped labyrinth of 'Cyberspace'.
Despite the lack of copyright enforcement on the Internet, which potentially
could undermine the value of their traditional paper-based products, leading
publishing houses are showing increasing interest in the Internet as a new
publishing medium.
The potential of this huge new market - one new Internet user is said to be
'logging on' every two minutes - is too much to ignore, despite the
drawbacks. The new wave of Internet users is dominated by corporate users
and by well-heeled consumers, making them a particularly attractive target
for many publishers.
Several business models have emerged as publishers attempt to tap into this
potentially important new market. These range from offering 'teasers' to
on-line readers in the hopes of persuading them to subscribe to magazines
and newsletters, to experiments with electronic distribution of book
manuscripts.
One of the biggest attractions of the Internet is that it is a very low cost
publishing channel. Anybody with a personal computer, a modem and an account
with one of the hundreds of services that offer Internet access can in
theory 'publish' whatever they wish for the cost of a telephone call.
Beyond lowering the cost of 'vanity publishing', however, the Internet
represents an opportunity to add value to the purchase of reference works
and textbooks. Addison-Wesley, for example, is making one of its textbooks
'Parallel Programming for Scientists and Engineers', available on the
Internet. The publisher assumes that students will still want to buy bound
copies of the book, but will appreciate the opportunity to search the text
on-line.
In another Internet publishing experiment, Encyclopedia Britannica is going
on-line to offer electronic distribution of its materials to universities
and some public libraries. Using software that limits access, the publisher
plans to charge libraries according to a formula reflecting the size of
their subscriber base.
The electronic version of the encyclopedia, called Britannica Online, is
being tested at the University of California at San Diego. The on-line
version includes 'hypertext' links that guide users to related topics as
they search through the text; a feature that cannot be matched by the
traditional book version.
For magazines and newsletters aimed at computer buffs, the Internet can be a
valuable distribution channel. The magazine Wired, which has built a
reputation for publishing articles about the Internet, provides Internet
users with copies of back issues and the opportunity to subscribe on-line
via commercial information services such as America On Line.
The Electronic Newsstand, a Washington, DC-based company founded last year,
offers publishers an opportunity to market magazines, books, newsletters and
business information via the Internet for a Dollars 1000 set-up fee and a
share of subscription payments.
Most of the publishers that use this service provide a few articles from
each issue to lure subscribers. In its first 10 months on the Internet, the
Electronic Newsstand attracted over 3m accesses from over 75,000 different
sites, the company says.
The Electronic Newsstand is in the forefront of a growing trend to create
'billboards on the information highway'; electronic spaces on the Internet
in which companies can display their wares.
Another example of this trend is MecklerWeb, a new venture of Meckler Media,
the US publishing group. Launched earlier this year, MecklerWeb aims to
'provide companies with an inexpensive and rapid means of establishing an
Internet presence,' the company says.
One of the most successful commercial Internet publishing projects is the
Global Network Navigator, an Internet 'magazine' founded last October by
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, a US book publisher that specialises in computer
topics.
By last month GNN had attracted over 40,000 registered users and twice as
many unregistered 'visitors' by offering articles about where to find
information resources on the Internet.
GNN is garnering attention from other businesses by establishing
'meta-centres' including a travel centre and a personal finance information
centre that feature a mix of editorial and promotional material.
Yet publishers must tread carefully as they move to exploit the potential of
this self-regulated global village. Founded in the late 1960s as a
government-funded programme to link researchers at US universities and
government laboratories electronically, the Internet was closed to all
business activity until about two years ago and many Internet users remain
resistant to the intrusions of commercial enterprise.
Other drawbacks include persistent security problems as Internet 'crackers'
break through the barriers that companies attempt to build to limit access
to commercially valuable information and the sometimes unreliable
performance of the Internet.
For now, the Internet is being used most effectively to publish information
about products and services that can be delivered through traditional
channels. As metering and billing technologies evolve it could, however,
become a significant medium for publishing and selling all kinds of
'information'.
In the meantime, the Internet can provide companies with a low cost
opportunity to reach markets that are beyond their geographic reach as well
as valuable experience in the emerging market for electronic publishing.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (7): Striking departures for
market leaders - German luxury carmakers: Kevin Done finds BMW and
Mercedes-Benz undertaking radical strategy changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swatch watch boutiques have run a special offer at some European airports
this year. 'Buy three Swatches, get a fourth free.'
It is an approach to marketing that might help to sell millions of cheap
watches a year, but until recently it could hardly have been further removed
from the refined world of Mercedes-Benz.
But the joint venture announced earlier this year between the prestigious
German luxury carmaker and SMH, the Swiss pioneer of cheap and cheerful
watches, to develop a micro compact car is one of the most dramatic signs
yet of the radical change of strategy embarked upon by Mercedes-Benz.
In a striking departure from corporate tradition the German group has mapped
out a future for itself as a maker of a full range of cars from flagship
limousines to two-seater micro city cars.
BMW, its arch domestic rival, is demonstrating a similar ability to rethink
its position in the world car industry. The Munich-based producer has
previously built its reputation on a fierce independence and a profound
reluctance to enter alliances with any other carmaker. Yet this year it has
moved to broaden substantially its industrial base with the takeover of
Rover group from British Aerospace.
Through the acquisition of the leading UK vehicle maker, BMW has doubled its
production capacity and has become the foremost European maker of four-wheel
drive sport/utility vehicles with Land Rover. It has acquired several new
brand-names - most importantly Rover and MG as well as Land Rover - along
with a position in the European market for small and medium-sized frontwheel
drive cars.
Both Mercedes-Benz and BMW have accepted that their car operations can no
longer be dependent solely on a German manufacturing base. They are moving
fast to establish foreign assembly plants, most importantly in North
America, but also in developing markets.
Last month the first BMW rolled off the assembly line at the group's Dollars
400m plant at Spartanburg, South Carolina, making it the only European
carmaker with an assembly plant in the US. Mercedes-Benz is not far behind,
however, and is developing its first North American passenger vehicle plant
in Alabama, where production should begin at the end of 1996.
The shake-up at Mercedes-Benz is one of the most surprising in the world
auto industry. The group has embarked on a far-reaching re-alignment of its
new product strategy after admitting publicly the unpalatable truth that the
company's luxury cars were 'over-engineered', and that if it persisted with
such a policy for developing new models, it would end up being 'priced-out'
of world markets. Mercedes-Benz's new strategy means that by the late 1990s
it will have launched a whole series of vehicles into new segments of the
world market including:
a multi-purpose vehicle called Viano, to rival models such as the Renault
Espace and to be built in Spain,
a modern four-wheel drive sport/utility vehicle that will be assembled in
the new plant in the US,
a small family car sized between a Volkswagen Golf and a Ford Fiesta, to be
produced in Germany, and most surprisingly
the micro compact car, a two-seater for urban commuting, that is under
development with SMH.
Helmut Werner, Mercedes-Benz chief executive, claims that the group's
traditional customers are on the move into new markets, and the executive
and luxury carmaker must be there to meet them.
Referring to the plan to create the so-called 'Swatchmobile' he says boldly:
'We intend to create a market segment which has hitherto not existed in this
form yet provides substantial growth potential . . . The micro compact car
is ideally suitable to re-define urban mobility.'
Mr Werner expects to decide by the end of the year on the location of the
first assembly plant for the minicar in Europe, which is likely to have a
capacity to produce about 130,000 cars a year with a workforce of only 1,000
to 1,200. Output is scheduled to begin in 1997.
The engineering and manufacturing strategies for the minicar will break new
ground for Mercedes-Benz with the extensive use of outside automotive
engineering consultancies and 70 to 80 per cent of the components purchased
from outside components.
The Mercedes-Benz transformation is not being achieved without pain,
although the car operations have broken back into profit this year after
last year's heavy losses.
The recovery this year has been helped by severe measures to cut costs and
jobs, to boost productivity and to rationalise operations, but it has also
been supported by an improvement in Mercedes-Benz's car sales and the
successful launch a year ago of the new C-Class executive car range.
Car production in the first half of the year jumped by 44.3 per cent to
302,076, while car sales volumes increased by 40.3 per cent to 296,770 and
turnover rose by 22.8 per cent to DM21.2bn.
The new projects under development are expected to increase Mercedes-Benz
car production to around 1m units a year by the end of the decade according
to Edzard Reuter, chairman of the Daimler-Benz group management board.
Mercedes-Benz is planning to increase the share of its car production
outside Germany to 10 per cent in the medium-term from only 2 per cent at
present with production growing in countries such as the US, Mexico, South
Korea and India.
With the marketplace fragmenting BMW, too, has accepted that it must move
into new segments to add to its niche of high-performance executive and
luxury cars.
It could have continued to go it alone and develop the necessary products
itself, but that would have taken time and would have been much more
expensive. Instead, it has chosen the riskier fast track of acquisition.
It believes that with Rover it has also found a viable way of entering the
small car market without diluting its own precious brand image. Rover is to
be its centre for small car development. 'You must not over-stretch the core
brand values of BMW. A small BMW would not comply with the hard core BMW
image, that we have worked for 20 years to achieve,' says Bernd
Pischetsrieder, BMW management board chairman.
Mercedes-Benz and BMW are both striking out in bold new directions, but they
have chosen very different routes to enter the small car market. 'I told
Werner he was wrong,' Mr Pischetsrieder said earlier this year. 'Clearly he
does not think so.'

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (9): Markets approach
saturation - Christopher Parkes examines restructuring tactics in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent downgrading of Daimler-Benz's long-term debt by the Standard &amp;
Poor's ratings agency came as an unnecessary but timely reminder for the
German automotive industry that this year's expected recovery in profits,
however welcome, has yet to be underpinned by an enduring improvement in
competitiveness.
As S&amp;P said, despite a 6.8 per cent increase in European car registrations
in the first half, long-term demand growth was likely to slow as markets
approached saturation. At the same time, increasing economic integration
within the region, the erosion of world trade barriers and intensifying
price competition would probably heighten the impact of future ups and downs
in the economic cycle.
Profits are set to increase across the board this year after last year's
slump into losses by all but BMW, and most analysts expect further
improvements as the end of the decade approaches and the savings wrought by
rationalisation in the past two years show up.
The most striking change in German factories has been on the shop floor,
where automotive company's workforces have been slashed and reorganised.
From a peak of 788,000 employees in July 1991, the industry had reduced its
headcount by 150,000 in July this year, and a further 50,000 jobs are
scheduled to go. Team working and continuous improvement processes have
become commonplace methods of increasing productivity.
BMW, earliest into restructuring and the most advanced down the road to
modern production methods, has managed a job-cutting programme which started
in 1989 through natural wastage and limited early retirement.
Flexible working times, short-term contracts for production workers and
weekend shifts have been introduced to cope with fluctuations in demand.
This policy reflects BMW's determination to establish a new order in its
domestic manufacturing processes. In short, long-term investments in
domestic fixed plant will be based on long-term prospects and plans, while
short-term demand shifts will be countered by the flexible use of manpower.
But even the most bright-eyed optimists recognise that the savings to be
gained from cutting and shuffling staff and reordering working methods are
not enough to compensate for Germany's ingrained labour cost disadvantages.
In the most extreme instances, each DM1 in basic pay is supplemented by a
further 80 pfennigs in tax, health, and statutory and voluntary welfare and
social benefit contributions.
One common response has been an increase in foreign components sourcing - a
possibility enhanced by the development of market economies in relatively
low-wage countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic - which has
increased the estimated average proportion of non-German parts built into
German-made vehicles from 25 per cent in 1992 to about 35 per cent this
year.
There is also an accelerating trend towards outsourcing of components
formerly made within car manufacturers' works to specialist suppliers which
can increase their economies of scale and reduce unit costs. Hence, for
example, Mercedes-Benz's recent decision to hand over seat construction at
its Bremen works to Leister Recaro.
Even more significant is the emergence of new partnerships between vehicle
makers and their suppliers which is creating a new hierarchical structure
among components makers. Accordingly, Mercedes has in the past two months
set up two trend-setting joint ventures dedicated to supplying Mercedes and
outside customers with key component modules.
Accordingly, its future supplies of complete power steering units will be
supplied from an operation set up with and to be operated by ZF. Volkswagen
has said it may join in later. Mercedes has also bundled its engine valve
systems manufacture, currently focused in a factory in Bad Homburg, into a
separate arrangement with two parts suppliers in a three-sided operation to
be known as MWP.
But the most telling change in German management thinking has been wrought
by the realisation that its traditional sales ground, western Europe, is
virtually saturated.
Average annual growth for the next few years may reach 2.5 per cent,
according to some estimates, but average expansion for the 1990s as a whole
is expected to be only 1 to 2 per cent.
According to Achim Diekmann, chief executive of the VDA industry
association, the situation in the 1980s when 90 per cent of world market
growth sprang from Europe, the US and Japan, has been virtually reversed in
the 1990s with 70 per cent coming from the Asean region,
newly-industrialised countries and Latin America.
While motor vehicle sales in Latin America alone are expected to double to
5m units a year by 2000, the VDA estimates that vehicle output in Asia - a
mere 2m units in 1990 - will have increased four-fold by the end of the
decade.
As has been recognised in other German boardrooms in other industries, the
chances of carving out a substantial share of such markets via exports out
of high-cost Germany are slim. The upshot has been an acceleration in the
flow of capital investment into the developing regions.
Announcements of joint ventures in assembly and to a lesser extent
full-scale manufacturing are becoming regular occurrences. Although
over-shadowed in terms of scale by such investments as BMW's and Mercedes'
first US manufacturing plants, due to open shortly, the trend is now clearly
set.
Mercedes, targeting the Chinese bus market, has three joint manufacturing
ventures under development or study. In India it has a majority stake in a
new concern to manufacture E-Class executive saloons. Volkswagen was early
into the Chinese car market and is now enjoying rapid sales growth. But it
has had less luck elsewhere as continuing shake-outs at its ventures in
Spain's Seat and Skoda demonstrate. Autolatina, a collaborative venture
between VW and Ford in Brazil is also on the verge of restructuring.
Meanwhile, its arch rival in the German market, Adam Opel, is stretching its
wings into every accessible corner of the emerging global market for
passenger cars. A network of Opel assembly plants stretching from Poland to
Indonesia is being established around a central hub at the company's
Russelsheim technical development centre near Frankfurt.
While other German manufacturers' plans appear less clearly defined, they
share the same logical basis as Opel's: while their high domestic costs and
the expensive D-Mark militate fiercely against exports, Germany's high
reputation for technical excellence is the passport which will give them a
fighting chance in the new markets needed to secure their long-term future.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (8): Ever-more-complex
transatlantic tussle - The industrial espionage battle between Volkswagen
and General Motors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The scene of the industrial espionage battle between Volkswagen and General
Motors has moved from the high ground and the newspaper headlines into the
legal quicksands.
Investigations of the circumstances surrounding the defection to VW of Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the US group's global purchasing supremo, in
March last year have become bogged down in mountains of paper in Germany and
enmeshed in an ever-more complex transatlantic tussle involving lawyers and
politicians.
But GM remains convinced that the probe into what a German judge described
as 'potentially the biggest-ever case of industrial espionage' will
eventually show that at the time VW recruited Mr Lopez along with seven of
his closest associates from Detroit and the group's German subsidiary, Adam
Opel, it also gained access to vast volumes of General Motors' confidential
data.
Staff poaching and charges of dirty dealing are common enough in the world
of international business, but the intensity of GM's attack on Europe's
biggest volume carmaker and the scale of the allegations it has made have
yet to be matched in the motor trade.
The basic charges are that at the same time as Mr Lopez was negotiating his
terms at VW (and consistently denying that he was about to leave GM), he and
his associates were systematically looting Adam Opel's industrial secrets.
These included details of Opel's entire European component supplier network
and key contract data, especially prices; plans for a new-style low-cost,
high speed car factory, and information on new models.
Mr Lopez has consistently denied any wrong-doing, and has got on with his
new job. Formerly renowned within GM for squeezing price concessions out of
component suppliers, he was charged by his new boss, VW chairman, Ferdinand
Piech, with a leading role in helping the German group claw back a 30 per
cent production cost disadvantage in relation to French and Japanese
competitors.
Now, while VW races to reach the promised break-even point this year after
last time's DM2.3bn loss, a German criminal investigation, launched in May,
1993 after GM aired its initial suspicions at the public prosecutor's office
in Darmstadt, is gnawing snail-fashion at a mountain of paper and electronic
data.
Dorothea Holland, until four months ago the only prosecuting lawyer on the
German case, assembled this mountain - officially estimated as equivalent to
about 2m computer print-out sheets - during one of the more spectacular
phases of the probe, in a raid on VW's headquarters in August last year.
Now, reinforced by at least one other prosecutor, she and her team have
disappeared into the pile of paper.
Following a steady flow of leaks and statements on apparently incriminating
discoveries, her office has been gagged by senior legal authorities.
No further announcements will be made until a decision has been reached on
whether there is evidence enough to indict Mr Lopez and/or his associates.
Until the gag was imposed, Ms Holland had appeared to be making substantial
progress.
According to her office, boxes which were discovered early in the
investigation in the former home of two of Mr Lopez's colleagues were found
to contain some of the allegedly confidential documents which GM claimed had
disappeared at the time of Mr Lopez's leaving.
These included plans for the 0-Car, a mini-style vehicle designed for the
hard-fought European market, and detailed price information.
According to eye-witness reports which to date have not been challenged by
VW, the apartment's former occupants, now employed by the German group, had
earlier been observed shredding large quantities of documents with two
machines.
By VW's own admission, shredders were also used in its corporate guest house
in Wolfsburg to destroy papers and other materials which arrived there
almost immediately after Mr Lopez's appointment to the VW board.
According to VW's statements, the 'possibly sensitive' material was shredded
to prevent its circulating within the VW group.
In late April this year, just before the flow of progress reports dried up,
Ms Holland's office reported that the haul from her VW raid had been found
to include plans for a revolutionary car factory, known as 'Plant B' within
VW, which showed striking similarities to Opel's 'Plant X'. It also emerged
that further GM data was discovered on a computer diskette that had been
compiled by one of Mr Lopez's daughters.
Meanwhile, a US probe, started at the instigation of the Commerce Department
in Washington, is stuck at the German border in a hither-and-thither
exchange involving local and federal governments, the Darmstadt diggers and
VW's and GM's legal advisers.
This investigation, which was launched after US President Bill Clinton
apparently decided that industrial espionage in general was a threat to his
nation's well-being, is in principle a far more simple or at least more
single-minded pursuit than that of Ms Holland.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing possible mail and wire fraud.
In effect, if GM data is found to have been posted or transmitted across
state or federal boundaries without the knowledge or permission of its
owner, then those responsible, the recipient or its agents may be liable to
criminal prosecution and huge fines.
After months of toing and froing, the Bonn justice ministry recently agreed
in principle that the FBI could have access to the evidence gathered in the
German investigation.
However, since under German law VW has a right to know details of any
proposed information exchange, and the right to challenge any planned moves
in court, the scene appears to be set for an extended interlude that will
spell yet more frustration for GM and relief for the VW management.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of New Broadcast and Communication Media (8): Digital
sound is on the way - Radio
</HEADLINE>

The impact of technical change now sweeping through television is also
likely to change the world of radio through the arrival of Digital Audio
Broadcasting. Already satellites and cable networks are delivering compact
disc quality sound to subscribers but digital sound is now on the way for
all radio listeners, whether they are on the move with portable transistors
or driving at speed along a motorway.
Digital radio services, which of course need new receivers with more
sophisticated microchips, will offer distortion-free and uninterrupted
radio, with eventually the possibility of more efficient use of the radio
spectrum and extra services.
The BBC will announce formally later this month that it is to begin network
transmissions of DAB next September in the London area and move to cover 60
per cent of the UK population within three years, coverage that would
include the main urban areas and the country's motorway system. Further
expansion would depend on the success of DAB but could in the end reach more
than 99 per cent of the population.
Though the BBC is believed to be the first broadcaster to commit itself to a
full DAB service, experimental or pilot broadcasts already exist or are
planned in Germany, Sweden, France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland
and in Canada. As Mr Richard Norman, chairman of Brema, the UK consumer
electronics trade organisation, put it recently: 'Digital Audio Broadcasting
is the first substantive new system proposal to be put forward for broadcast
radio since the introduction of VHF/FM some 40 years ago.'
Progress on DAB is the result of nearly 10 years of collaboration between
European broadcasters and the European electronics industry under the Eureka
programme. Work on developing the system is now complete and a specification
has been submitted to the European Telecommunication Standards Institute.
The DAB system could have even greater significance for manufacturers and
listeners and become the world radio standard for the 21st century. A group
of UK companies is already at work on developing a low-cost design for a DAB
receiver and the special VLSI (very large scale integration) chips for the
receiver should be available this autumn.
The BBC as a publicly funded broadcaster is taking on the responsibility of
trying to circumvent the impasse that often stands in the way of the
introduction of new broadcasting ventures - without a service there is no
incentive for manufacturers to mass produce receivers and vice versa.
Lord Chalfont, chairman of the Radio Authority, the body that regulates
commercial radio in the UK, conceded recently that it would be the BBC
rather than the commercial radio sector that would have to drive DAB forward
initially. 'The world-at-large should not expect a rush into DAB
broadcasting. It is more realistic to envisage a rolling commitment, with
one or two independent broadcasters perhaps coming in at or near the leading
edge and others joining them later as they see advantage in doing so,' he
said.
The growing momentum behind DAB in the UK comes at a time of increasing
interest in radio generally, with a large number of new commercial stations
coming on air. Last month alone, five regional commercial stations were
launched, plus a Country and Western station for London. All the signs are
that the commercial sector, which now commands 47.4 per cent of total
listening in competition with the established networks of the BBC, should
win a majority share by the end of this year or early 1995.
Because of the number of new stations coming on air, the BBC is reconciled
to losing some audience share although BBC Radio still attracts some 29m
people every week. Indeed, the BBC deliberately repositioned Radio 1 to give
it a more public service emphasis, losing millions of listeners as a result.
Radio 5 Live, the combined news and sports network launched this year by the
BBC is so far regularly reaching 4.5m adults. The commercial radio
opportunities in the British market are also attracting foreign investors.
Emmis Broadcasting of Indianapolis and CanWest, the Canadian-owned
international broadcaster, are both investors in UK Talk Radio, the third
national commercial station due to launch in February. NRJ, the French
broadcaster which has taken its 'energy concept' to more than 10 cities in
Europe, has joined MTV to apply for one of four new London licences on
offer. The company wants to run a 'hot adult contemporary' station in
London. Its continental rivals for the licence include CLT of Luxembourg,
which also has extensive broadcasting interests across Europe.
Apart from the new licences in a significant market where commercial radio
has been relatively underdeveloped in the past, they are attracted by the
sudden growth of radio in the UK. Commercial radio was once known as 'the 2
per cent medium' because it traditionally took only about 2 per cent of
total advertising revenue. In the past 18 months this has grown to 4 per
cent and some analysts think radio could hit 5 per cent by the end of the
year.
Commercial radio's gross advertising revenue for the second quarter of this
year was Pounds 52.6m - representing year-on-year growth of 23.1 per cent.
Such growth might even help to boost the spread of Digital Audio
Broadcasting.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of New Broadcast and Communication Media (7): Europe
satellite wars may get even more intense - The latest campaigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the next few months, Europe's satellite television wars are likely to
become even more intense with the launch of two large new satellites by the
main operators - Societe Europeenne des Satellites and Eutelsat, the
European satellite organisation.
SES, the Luxembourg-based company that runs the Astra satellite system,
hopes to launch its fourth dedicated television satellite at the end of this
month. It will be a huge satellite, capable of transmitting 16 channels of
television using existing analogue technology plus two transponders set
aside for experimenting with digital television. There will also be 40
transponders, designed to provide back-up if any of Astra's existing three
satellites were to fail. If all goes well, the satellites should be
operational by next January.
Next month, Eutelsat plans to launch its 16-channel television satellite
called Hot Bird 1, to intensify the challenge to Astra. The satellite will
be able to broadcast television channels throughout Europe as well as in
most of North Africa and the Middle East.
Eutelsat's strategy is to create 13 degrees east as the 'hot' position to
be. Hot Bird 1 will join an existing Eutelsat satellite and there are plans
to launch Hot Bird 2 in 1996. The users of Hot Bird 1 will include MTV, NBC
Superchannel TV 5 and the newly launched European Business News.
The two satellite systems have developed in a rather complementary way. So
far, Astra has been the dominant supplier of subscription channels such as
movie channels in Europe. Eutelsat has tended to concentrate more on
carrying advertising backed channels such as Euronews or NBC Superchannel,
delivering channels to cable networks and community systems.
Astra channels were available by mid-year in a total of 53.1m European
homes, 36m of them through cable networks and 16.7m through individual
dishes and communal aerial systems.
Eutelsat services, as of April, were available in 38.3m cable homes, 2.2m
homes served by community aerials and 2.8m homes with their own dishes.
Even SES directors concede that the competition between the two systems will
become more intense as satellite channel operators consider launching
digital television services.
The great advantage of digital, as opposed to analogue television, is that
once a television picture is turned into digital a large number of channels
can be squeezed into the capacity formerly occupied by one. The broadcaster
can choose to have a smaller number of extra channels and instead broadcast
in a widescreen format or provide a high definition picture.
National Transcommunications, the privatised transmission and research
division of the old Independent Broadcasting Authority, has recently been
demonstrating its digital compression system, which squeezes eight
television channels into a single transponder.
Star TV may launch the first 150-channel systems in Asia and Europe before
the end of next year.
On its new Hot Bird 1 Eutelsat offers broadcasters the opportunity
simultaneously to transmit a channel in both analogue and digital form at no
extra cost.
Eutelsat says that tests of the new system earlier this year demonstrated
that the analogue channel could still be received by 80cm dishes while the
simultaneous digital channel provided pictures that exceeded normal
broadcast quality.
Astra is planning to devote both its fifth and sixth satellites entirely to
digital television if the market demand is there.
Much will depend on decisions taken by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation
and his ally, Mr Leo Kirch, the German media entrepreneur.
The two would like to have eight channels, it is believed, on the new
analogue Astra 1 (d) satellite. The aim would be to launch 'near video-on
demand' - giving over a number of channels to a selection of recent hit
movies. Showing times are then staggered, so that the viewer is never far
away from the start of the movie of his choice.
In return for a large number of channels on the new analogue satellite, the
company is implicitly seeking a commitment to lease capacity on the new
digital satellites.
If digital television is to be launched soon in Europe, it will require
close co-operation between the manufacturers of the special receivers
needed, the satellite operators and the satellite broadcasters -
particularly the owners of movie and sports channels.
'We want to nurse them through into digital and they want us to nurse them
through to digital,' was how one of those involved describes the
negotiations.
Particularly for News Corporation, the decision to launch digital television
across Europe - and with it pay-per-view services - could involve the
investment of hundreds of millions of pounds.
Astra has always described itself as technology-neutral and will dedicate
its fourth and fifth satellites wholly to digital services only if that is
what the market wants.
Recent internal feuds at SES, and a failed attempt to remove Dr Pierre
Meyrat, the Astra director-general, have clouded the issues.
It is not yet clear just how rapid the move to digital television will be
but it is certain - as long as the new Astra and Eutelsat satellites are
successfully launched - that the television choices available to European
viewers will continue to increase.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of New Broadcast and Communication Media (6): The 1m
watershed - Cable Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Earlier this summer, Bell Cablemedia, one of the largest UK cable operators,
pushed ahead with a listing on the Nasdaq market in the US despite difficult
market conditions and at a time when others were pulling flotation plans to
await better times. Bell had little choice but to go ahead as flotation was
a requirement for creating the company that brings together Bell Canada,
Cable and Wireless and Jones Intercable.
The combined Bell group, which now has 18 franchises covering more than 2m
homes, managed to get its flotation and a substantial debt offering away and
raised nearly Dollars 500m. 'It is a significant step forward for the
industry,' says Mr Alan Bates, chief executive of Bell Cablemedia and
chairman of the Cable Television Association, who promises to float the
cable group on the London Stock Exchange, probably by the middle of next
year.
Since the float Bell's shares have shot up, influenced partly by the
decision by Oftel, the telecommunications regulatory body, in favour of
telephone number portability. Until now, anyone planning to leave British
Telecom to obtain a cable telephone had to get a new number. This made small
businesses wary of switching to cable telephony because they did not want to
lose well- known telephone numbers.
More cable flotations are clearly on the way and with them the creation of a
market in UK cable shares. Comcast, another of the top 10 cable operators in
the UK is also in the process of floating on the Nasdaq market. TeleWest,
the joint venture between US West, the US telephone company and TCI of
Denver, the largest American cable operator, is dusting down its postponed
London flotation plans.
The flurry of financial activity symbolises the growing confidence of the
cable industry which has already spent Pounds 1.5bn in building cable
networks past some 3m homes out of the projected Pounds 10bn total cost to
cable three-quarters of Britain. Indeed, comparatively small franchises that
five years might have been difficult to give away are attracting competitive
bids of around Pounds 1m a year.
The actual average penetration rates for cable television - the ratio
between those who actually subscribe and those whose homes or businesses are
actually passed by the cable network and therefore could subscribe - remain
at a stubbornly low 21.3 per cent. But that is increasingly being seen as
only part of the story.
The investment community is waking up to the fact that cable is an industry
producing three streams of revenue from a single network - television
subscriptions, residential telephone revenues and business
telecommunications revenues. This is possible because the UK is the only
major country so far to license cable companies to compete in the
telecommunications market.
Salomon Brothers, the US stockbrokers, recently published a study called UK
Cable/Telephone: Land of Opportunity. 'Cable television in the UK presents a
tremendous opportunity in one of the most rapidly developing sectors of
industry today - communications. US and global cable and telephone operators
have partnered to build a state-of-the-art fibre optic communications
infrastructure in the UK,' Salomons concluded.
The number of subscribers has already reached 750,000 and Mr Bates expects
it to exceed 1m by the turn of the year on the back of building out of the
networks, even if actual penetration averages do not rise.
Cable operators think they have done reasonably well if they get 20 per cent
of the population to subscribe initially to television only services. Add
telephony and the percentage goes up to 26 per cent or higher. Telephony
also greatly reduces the 'churn' factor - the proportion of customers who
disconnect every year. Already more than 500,000 cable telephone lines have
been installed and free or discounted local calls are proving to be a
valuable marketing tool.
The 1m subscriber figure, if it is reached soon, is an important watershed
for cable. It means, for instance , that cable services will be worth
marketing nationally for the first time and a campaign is being planned for
early next year.
More thought is also being given to the quality and range of programmes
carried on cable networks. There are already cable exclusive channels such
as Wire TV, the Parliamentary Channel and Performance, the arts channel.
Mostly, however, cable acts as retailer for the satellite broadcasters such
as British Sky Broadcasting.
'There is no doubt that cable operators must start having an alternative
source of product other than Rupert Murdoch (whose News International owns
half of BSkyB),' Mr Bates says.
The process has already begun with the purchase of rights to cricket and
World Cup rugby in 1996. There is also the planned launch later this year of
Channel One, the 24-hour news service being created for the London cable
market by Associated Newspapers. The Mirror Group has also announced it
plans to launch a national cable channel early next year with local
partners. Midland Independent Newspapers, publishers of the Birmingham Post
and Mail, has signed up to provide a special news and magazine service for
the Birmingham area.
The industry, however, is divided on exactly how the programming initiative
should go. Mr Vernon Achber, chief executive of Telecential, with franchises
covering more than 600,000 homes, believes: 'We must fill the vacuums and
those are in regional programmes - sport and news. I can't see any point in
general entertainment going on a national basis.'
The majority view seems to be that a more substantial programme initiative
is needed to help take cable subscriptions upwards and a permanent company
to buy programme rights on behalf of the industry and help establish new
channels could be set up next year. Mr Bates, the CTA chairman, would like
to see between three to five cable exclusive channels being created over the
next couple of years.
Perhaps the greatest reason for growing confidence in the UK cable industry
at the moment flows from the realisation that many important technological
and industrial arguments are going its way. As other people merely talk
about the electronic superhighways of the future, the cable industry says it
has hundreds of gangs of workmen out every day digging up the streets and
actually installing them.
'We are installing two and a half times more optical fibre cable than BT,'
says Mr Achber, who points out that the capacity of optical fibre is
virtually limitless. It is capable of carrying millions of telephone calls
or hundreds of television channels. Cable operators are installing fibre
optic cable to within 200 yards from the consumer.
If the market for new services such as interactive television and video on
demand takes off, then one day it may be economic to go the last 200 yards.
Some specialists believe it might not be necessary and that the growing
sophistication of the electronics being built into cable switching devices
in the local neighbourhood will be able to supply all the new services
anyway.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (5): Large overheads persist -
Change is being sought in the way cars are sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European carmakers and importers are in quandary about what long-term form
they would like the retailing of their products to take.
The upcoming European Union verdict on whether to continue the industry's
block exemption from normal EU competition rules, and which permits the
industry to restrict sales to exclusively franchised dealers, may yet impose
its own structural change on car retailing in Europe.
But even if Brussels were to decide to extend the exemption for another 10
years and leave its terms largely unchanged, commercial pressures are
building which are themselves expected to bring substantial restructuring of
the estimated 100,000 manufacturer-franchised outlets through which new cars
are sold throughout Europe.
The commercial pressures have much to do with the need to cut the costs
involved in both the distribution and retailing of vehicles.
In the past 10 years, most European car makers have concentrated heavily on
reducing manufacturing costs and raising production efficiency as the main
means of seeking to get on terms with Japanese competition.
Much of the fat has now been cut out of manufacturing. But large and
unnecessary overheads persist in distribution and retailing because of the
fragmented nature of retailing, not least wide differences in practice
between individual countries.
Most manufacturers are starting to address the problems, through 'lean'
distribution systems which are at least shortening the supply pipeline to
dealers.
The important questions for the future, as seen by the manufacturers, are
how many dealers should there be and how large and powerful can individual
dealer groups be allowed to grow?
On the one hand, the manufactures know there are too many small and
inefficient dealers scattered throughout Europe. They welcome the
efficiencies and investment capability of large dealer groups.
On the other, they have no wish to see big retailing groups hold sway over
the manufacturers as with, for example, the supremacy of the big supermarket
chains in food retailing. Some kind of new balance needs to be struck.
Throughout most of Europe, the market is served by more than 90,000 dealers,
many of them small, individually owned dealers known in the industry as
'mama and papa' businesses. In France, size and population distribution has
contributed to the development of one of the most fragmented retailing
infrastructures, with a first tier of the 'mama and papa' dealers
outnumbering the main dealerships by more than four-to-one. The two-tier
dealer structure itself represents an inefficiency but is entrenched in the
system throughout Europe.
The UK, however, also has a band of large, financially powerful public
groups - some owning about 100 outlets each - eager and willing to invest
sums in the business far beyond those which could be contemplated by the
'mamas and papas'.
The biggest, the Lex Service group with more than 120 outlets covering most
major franchises, accounted for nearly 3.5 per cent of all UK new car sales
last year.
Furthermore in the UK the two-tier system is being dismantled. This summer,
for example, the Rover Group announced that 150 of its small dealers would
have to go as the result of a move to a single-tier dealer network by the
middle of 1997. The network is to be based primarily on Rover's existing
main dealers.
The main dealers will be required to set up 'satellite' sub-dealerships in
areas previously occupied by the small independent retail outlets -
investments relatively easily made by the big dealers groups and with the
outlets benefiting from the group's overall economies of scale.
With retained profit per car shrinking under the pressure of competition, as
Europe moves towards a completely open market for new cars at the end of the
decade, maximising sales per outlet is becoming of ever greater importance.
By that yardstick, Europe as a whole is remarkably inefficient compared with
North America, where new car prices are well below European levels. Europe's
100,000 franchised dealers last year sold some 11.4m new cars, an average of
114 each. Their roughly 25,000 US counterparts sold 13m - an average 520 per
outlet. Even allowing for last year being a relatively poor one for Europe
while the US was recovering, the contrast is a stark one.
The UK already occupies a half-way house between Europe as a whole and the
US. This year, total UK sales are likely to reach slightly short of 2m -
well below the record 2.3m of 1989, but enough to provide the country's
7,400 franchised dealers an average of nearly 270 cars per outlet.
As an annual survey by the trade journal Automotive Management of the UK's
biggest dealer groups - many of them publicly owned - shows, the big have
steadily been getting bigger. Their combined turnover topped Pounds 15bn for
the first time last year and they are estimated by Automotive Management to
have accounted for 37.5 per cent of all new car sales last year.
While many small, individually owned dealerships in the UK and continental
Europe have ceased trading in the post-1990 recessions, most of these big
groups have remained profitable, maintained a high level of investment and
continued to take over less competent smaller rivals.
Their credentials for playing an ever-expanding role in an industry in need
of their expertise and efficiencies appear impeccable. Yet their very
effectiveness has made manufacturers wary of their potential power. As a
result, dealers historically have been junior partners in the
manufacturer-dealer relationship.
Much as many groups wanted to they were forbidden, for example, to set up
multi-franchise sites where customers compare one make against another.
Ford, for years the unchallenged UK market leader, had a rule whereby no
single group could hold more than five Ford outlets or operate any other
franchise within 20 miles of that outlet.
This was all very well for Ford when it controlled more than 30 per cent of
the market - at the time around twice the share of anyone else. Now its
share is just over 20 per cent, Vauxhall is treading on its heels and Rover
is not far behind. Toyota, Nissan and Honda are increasing their UK
manufacturing output and new players from the Far East such as Kia and
Daewoo are joing Hyundai on the scene.
Europe is becoming more competitive as manufacturers crowd into the market.
The big dealers' dependence on any one manufacturer, even Ford, is dwindling
and with it their submissiveness to manufacturer diktat.
Cracks are appearing: Vauxhall and Rover are allowing multi-franchising. The
big dealer groups may now have a maximum of eight Ford dealerships.
Thus the balance of power is starting to tilt in the UK.
It may be only a question of time before Lex, Inchape and their cohorts
start to turn their attention to taking their expertise to continental
Europe and starting the transformation process there.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (6): Carmakers locked into
lobbying battle - Moves in Brussels to liberalise the car market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's carmakers have been locked for several months in an intensive
lobbying battle in Brussels against the plans of the European Commission's
competition directorate for liberalising the European car market.
At issue is the reform of the so-called block exemption granted to the motor
industry for 10 years in 1985, which allows carmakers to operate selective
and exclusive car distribution and retailing systems in contravention of
European competition rules. The present regulation expires at the end of
June 1995.
After much delay the Commission is set to publish shortly its proposed terms
and conditions for a new block exemption. Following consultation with
governments and the opposed ranks of the car producers and European consumer
organisations, it is hoped that details of a new regulation can be finalised
by the end of the year.
The timetable is tight, but Karel van Miert, competition commissioner, is
anxious to have the new rules agreed before the four-year term of the
present Commission runs out at the end of December.
At stake are sharply contrasting visions of how new cars should be sold and
serviced, an issue that affects millions of car owners across Europe and
which arouses intense emotions among Europe's carmakers. Is the consumer
best served by the dedicated exclusive dealerships allowed under the present
system?
Or should the dealer networks be exposed to another order of competition,
with multifranchising - the sale of competing brands - allowed on the same
site.
During coming weeks the debate will focus on several issues:
Should dealers be allowed to take on other competing franchises within their
existing exclusive territories,
Should the carmakers have to provide technical information to independent
service garages, and
Should they have to agree sales objectives with dealers with independent
arbitration in the case of disagreement.
For how long should a new block exemption be granted, seven or 10 years, and
should there be an interim review of performance?
The battle over the terms of a new block exemption began in earnest in May,
when the contents of the competition directorate's first draft were
published in France.
In an 'explanatory note' the competition mandarins stated that 'the
experience acquired over the past 10 years shows that this regulation has
not contributed in any significant way to either the opening up of national
markets or to the development of flexible and efficient structures in the
distribution of cars and spares'. The block exemption had to be revised to
'remedy these defects and stimulate competition'.
The carmakers are incensed by the proposals. They argue that the present
regulation works well, that far from stifling competition, it actually
guarantees it, and that what the motor industry needs above all is
stability, as it fights to restructure and regain world competitiveness
against both Japanese and newly resurgent American rivals.
'There are those who wish, in particular within the European Commission, to
subject this industry to an unprecedented and arbitrary experiment . . . who
seek to undermine the whole foundation of automobile distribution in
Europe,' says Giorgio Garuzzo, chief operating officer of the Fiat group and
president of Acea, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.
The assault on the carmakers in Brussels has been led by the consumer
organisations, chiefly through Beuc, the Bureau Europeen des Unions de
Consommateurs.
Jim Murray, director of Beuc, says that the block exemption has been 'an
unmitigated disaster for consumers'. Beuc accepts the need for competent,
trained personnel to carry out garage servicing - the notion of
'selectivity' allowed in the regulation.
But it claims that there is 'no basis whatsoever' for allowing the present
twin notions of exclusivity, that allow manufacturers firstly to limit the
number of outlets on a geographic basis, and secondly to restrict them from
stocking more than one brand.
'Why shouldn't new car buyers have the chance to compare different brands at
a single outlet?' asks Mr Murray. 'This is the sort of consumer-friendly
distribution we would like to see in place after 1995.'
Beuc also maintains that the original block exemption of 1985 was granted on
the condition that new car prices across the then European Community should
not diverge beyond certain limits, namely 12 per cent in the long term and
18 per cent for periods of less than one year. It was also agreed on
condition that individual consumers were at all times free to buy cars
across borders from another member state. On both counts, the block
exemption has failed, it says.
The most recent car price study by the commission published this summer
showed that 22.5 per cent of the models produced by European manufacturers
had price differentials of more than 20 per cent. And as far as cross-border
car-buying is concerned, Beuc is scornful. It claims that consumers that try
to buy cars abroad are met with enormous difficulties, both from dealers and
carmakers and from institutional barriers in national import, registration
and tax regulations.
Acea has led the call for the extension of the existing vehicle distribution
system for another 10 years, essentially without modification.
Rudolf Beger, Acea executive secretary, claims that cars are different and
cannot be distributed like other products such as toasters or washing
machines. Cars are the most complex consumer goods on the market, and the
way in which they are serviced has big implications for both safety and the
environment.
The carmakers claim that the competition directorate has provided 'no
factual evidence whatsoever' to support the case for radical reforms.
Competition has increased greatly during the past 10 years, says Acea.
Between 1986 and 1993 the number of car brands sold on the German market has
jumped by 50 per cent from 44 to 66. The number of models and versions sold
in France has risen by 47 per cent from 515 in 1986 to 758 in 1993.
Surveys in the US show that customer satisfaction with conventional one-make
dealers is consistently higher than with dealerships selling various brands,
says Mr Beger.
The carmakers argue that exchange rate fluctuations are the biggest cause of
diverging car prices, not selective distribution. 'Total price harmonisation
will remain a fantasy as long as there is no truly uniform market with
harmonised taxes combined with a single currency or a prolonged period of
guaranteed currency stability,' argues Mr Beger.
As for cross-border car purchases, Acea says that it is already happening.
'In recent years more and more customers and dealers have purchased cars in
other member states,' says Mr Beger.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (2): East offers best outlook
for growth - While global sales are at last improving, the Asia Pacific
region holds the most promise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Global car sales could rise by 6 per cent or more this year as Europe pulls
out of recession to join the expanding markets of North America, Latin
America and the Asia Pacific region.
Car sales worldwide fell to 33.1m in 1993, the lowest level for six years,
but according to DRI McGraw-Hill, the automotive analysts, demand has now
moved into a period of recovery.
After three successive years of decline, global car sales are forecast to
rise to 35.3m in 1994. The main impulses for growth hitherto have come from
the US, where sales of cars and light trucks are now in the third year of
recovery and are forecast to rise by 12 per cent this year to more than
15.5m.
New car sales in western Europe fell by more than 15 per cent last year to
11.45m, the sharpest annual decline in the post-war period, but the tide
appears to have turned with sales rising by an estimated 6 per cent to
8.517m in the first eight months of the year.
In Japan carmakers have been locked in a protracted recession with new car
sales falling for three years in succession from 1991 to 1993. Registrations
after the first seven months of 1994 were still 1.9 per cent lower than in
the corresponding period a year ago, but in recent months there have been
fragile signs that the bottom of the recession has also finally been reached
in Japan.
Noel Goutard, chairman and chief executive of Valeo, the leading French
automotive components group, believes that prospects are positive for the
world auto industry.
'In 1994 we are in a new phase, and we anticipate strong growth,' says Mr
Goutard.
'We believe that by 1995-96 the American, European and Japanese markets will
be in a unique situation with all three converging on a path of strong
growth. Asia Pacific will join as a fourth important region. There will be
four markets in high gear.'
The latest study by DRI McGraw-Hill forecasts that a sustained period of
growth is in prospect with worldwide new car sales rising gradually to reach
record levels throughout the second half of the 1990s. Sales are forecast to
rise by 3 to 5 per cent in each of the next five years, rising from 35.3m
this year to 42.6m in 1999.
However, much of this growth will originate outside the traditional car
consuming nations of west Europe, North America and Japan, with South Korea,
China, Thailand, Latin America and east Europe offering the best outlook for
growth for the 1990s and beyond.
The world's leading carmakers are united in the view that the Asia Pacific
region holds the brightest prospects, and automotive sales in Asia
(excluding Japan) are expected to triple during the next 15 years.
According to Alex Trotman, chairman and chief executive of Ford, the world's
second largest vehicle maker, about 80 per cent of the world's population
lives outside the traditional automotive markets of western Europe, North
America and Japan, however the number of cars and trucks sold in these
regions represents only about 8 per cent of the world's total.
Some of the fastest growth is forecast for China, where the world's leading
carmakers, such as General Motors, Ford, Toyota and Mercedes-Benz are vying
to win approval for new vehicle projects in order to catch up on the lead
taken by Volkswagen of Germany, the Peugeot group of France and Daihatsu of
Japan.
New car sales in China have already jumped from only 78,000 in 1990 to about
430,000 last year, but the latest DRI study forecasts that sales could jump
to 1m by 1999.
This will be mirrored in a rapid build-up of car production in China with
output rising from 44,000 in 1990 to more than 700,000 by the end of the
decade, according to the DRI study.
South Korean carmakers led by Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo have also developed an
ambitious strategy for further growth in the coming decade.
DRI forecasts that car production in South Korea could jump by more than 1m
units in the next six years from 1.5m in 1993 to 2.64m in 1999.
New car sales in the domestic car market are expected to jump from 963,000
last year to 1.45m in 1999, but domestic expansion will be supplemented by
Korean carmakers pursuing aggressive growth plans overseas both through
strongly rising exports and foreign-based vehicle production.
In the world's developed markets the DRI report forecasts continued steady
recovery in west Europe for the rest of the decade, cautious expansion in
Japan but a slow-down in North America during the mid-1990s.
The pick-up in west Europe has been patchy this year with sales rising
strongly in France, Spain, Scandinavia and the UK, whereas Germany and Italy
are still struggling to throw off the grip of recession.
New car registrations in Germany, the biggest market in Europe, were still
running slightly lower than a year ago after the first eight months of the
year with a decline of 0.4 per cent. Worryingly, sales declined year-on-year
by 4.9 per cent in July and by 5.2 per cent in August.
Both the German and Italian markets are forecast to emerge from recession
next year, however, and sales in west Europe are forecast to rise by 5 to 7
per cent a year in each of the four years from 1994 to reach a record level
of 13.7m in 1996 rising further to 15m by 1999.
In the US, with car and truck sales already in their third year of recovery,
opinions differ over when the market will peak.
Ford is currently forecasting total US car and truck sales of around 15.5m
in 1994 compared with 14.2m last year and the nadir of 12.5m in 1991.
The previous peak of 16.3m was reached in 1986 and David McCammon, Ford
vice-president and treasurer, insists that 'the cycle still has several
years to go. We are early in the cycle in the US - still in the first half
of the cycle, in my view, and in Europe we're just at the beginning of the
recovery'.
Such optimism has not been shared by US financial markets in recent weeks,
where the share prices of the big three US carmakers have fallen sharply to
their lowest level for the year amid fears about rising interest rates.
The latest DRI forecast suggests that North American car sales will suffer
small declines in 1995 and 1996 after rising by 8.5 per cent this year. Cars
are expected to continue losing market share to light trucks - pickups,
sports/utility and multipurpose vehicles - which now account for more than
40 per cent of all US light vehicle sales.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (4): A formidable challenge
still - Kevin Done follows developments in the European car industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European car industry is in the midst of hectic transition, as the
European Union moves to become an open car market by the end of the decade.
All restrictions on car and light commercial vehicle imports from Japan are
due to be removed at the end of 1999, and carmakers in Europe are being
forced to act quickly to close the competitive gap behind their Japanese and
North American rivals.
The pain and dislocation of transition has been compounded by the severity
of the recession that struck the industry with full force last year, as west
European new car sales fell by more than 15 per cent to 11.4m, the lowest
total for eight years and the biggest year-on-year decline in the post-war
period.
Four of the Big Six volume car producers in west Europe, the Volkswagen
group of Germany, PSA Peugeot Citroen of France, the Fiat group of Italy and
Ford of Europe, were in loss last year, while profits fell sharply at
Renault of France and General Motors Europe (Opel in continental Europe and
Vauxhall in the UK).
New car sales have begun to flicker back to life this year, and the
financial performance of the industry is starting to recover, but the
underlying challenge remains formidable.
Several of the first wave of Japanese car plants in west Europe - built by
Nissan, Toyota and Honda - have started production, adding to existing
overcapacity and a fourth Japanese plant - a joint venture in the
Netherlands between Mitsubishi Motors and Volvo of Sweden - is due to open
next year.
The share taken by Japanese carmakers in west Europe may be down this year -
to 11 per cent in the first six months from 12.4 per cent in the
corresponding period a year ago - as their price competitiveness has been
battered by the rapid appreciation of the yen, but it is likely to be only a
temporary respite.
Japanese carmakers' west European market share is still forecast to rise to
more than 15 per cent by the end of the decade, and their presence in those
European markets that have previously operated without restrictions on
Japanese vehicle imports, serves as a constant reminder of the threat.
In the Netherlands Japanese carmakers controlled 25.9 per cent of the new
car market last year, for example, and in Finland 38.5 per cent.
Competition for the European carmakers is also growing from new sources,
most notably South Korea and North America.
Kia Motors is to become the first Korean carmaker to assemble passenger
vehicles in Europe in a project to build up to 30,000 vehicles a year in
Germany.
Kia established sales operations in many European markets for the first time
last year, and it will be followed in 1995 by Daewoo, the third largest
Korean vehicle maker. Hyundai, the leading Korean vehicle producer, says
that it is aiming nearly to double its European sales from less than 100,000
last year to 189,000 by the end of the decade.
North America is also becoming a growing source for vehicle exports to
Europe both from the big three US carmakers and from the expanding Japanese
production base in the US and Canada.
A recent study by the Economist Intelligence Unit forecast that North
American and South Korean manufacturers would almost treble their sales in
west Europe by 2000, with US import sales rising to more than 250,000 and
South Korean sales increasing to 325,000 by the end of the decade.
The market share of the traditional European car producers is forecast to
fall from 85 to 79 per cent during the period.
European carmakers are fighting back, however, and are in the midst of a
period of far-reaching restructuring.
Partly under the pressure of last year's heavy losses they have taken action
in order to improve efficiency, often with drastic reductions of their
workforces.
Volkswagen of Germany, the leading European car producer which suffered a
group loss of DM1.94bn last year, had reduced the workforce at its six
domestic plants (excluding Audi) in the past three years by 27,000 to about
102,000 by the spring of 1994.
Higher productivity and reduced sales volumes mean it still has about 30,000
surplus employees. For 1994 and 1995, VW is operating a pioneering agreement
with the German trade unions, however, allowing a sharp cut in pay and
working hours (to a 28.8 hours week) in order to stave off even more radical
job losses.
Ford of Europe, has reduced its workforce (excluding Jaguar) by 15 per cent
with the loss of 15,100 jobs since late 1992. Mercedes-Benz, the car and
commercial vehicle subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest engineering
group, cut 14,700 jobs from its domestic workforce in 1992, a further 11,000
last year and it is planning to cut another 8,000 jobs this year to bring
its workforce to 151,000 by the end of 1994.
The cost-cutting measures along with a modest improvement in new car sales
are helping the industry to improve its financial performance this year. New
car sales in west Europe in the first eight months rose by 6 per cent to
8.5m. After three successive years of losses Ford's European automotive
operations (excluding Jaguar) achieved a net profit of Dollars 353m in the
first half of 1994 compared with a loss of Dollars 47m in the corresponding
period a year ago.
The Volkswagen group cut its loss in the first half this year to DM209m from
a loss of DM1.6bn in the same period a year ago, and in the second quarter
alone it returned to the black with a profit of DM133m compared with a loss
of DM342m a year ago.
Volvo of Sweden, which is busy selling off most of its non-automotive
businesses in the wake of the break-up of its alliance with Renault,
increased its group operating income to SKr4.47bn in the first half this
year from only SKr166m a year ago. Its car operations alone jumped from an
operating loss of SKr70m in the first half last year to a profit of
SKr1.475bn in the first half of 1994.
Restructuring is continuing to lead to a further concentration of the
industry in Europe, most notably with the takeover earlier this year of
Rover, the leading UK carmaker, by BMW of Germany.
Restructuring is also taking on new forms, however, as carmakers move, for
example, to dispose of in-house components operations to outside suppliers
to allow themselves to concentrate on the core operations of the design,
development and assembly of vehicles.
Fiat has agreed recently to transfer a components operation with more than
700 employees to GKN, the UK automotive components supplier, and it is also
selling its Sepi seat-making operations to Lear Seating of the US for
Dollars 160m.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (3): Fertile ground for
conflict - Fast-expanding South Korea has joined Japan as a source of worry
for western carmakers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE

<TEXT>
The automotive industry is already providing fertile ground for trade
conflict between Japan on the one hand and the US and the European Union on
the other. Now, however, South Korea has become a new source of concern for
western carmakers.
The US trade deficit in automobiles and automotive parts with Japan remains
high and rose to a record Dollars 33.4bn last year accounting for 56 per
cent of the total US trade deficit with Japan. The EU's trade deficit with
Japan in motor vehicles - Ecu5.12bn (Pounds 4.02bn)  - accounted last year
for 20.4 per cent of the its total trade deficit with Japan. This was almost
offset, however, by a Ecu4.3bn surplus on vehicle trade last year with the
US.
While recent developments such as the strong increase in sales of imported
cars in Japan this year, increasing purchases of US auto parts by Japanese
vehicle makers - both for their US and domestic assembly plants - and the
continuing fall in the volume of Japanese vehicle exports, suggest that the
trade imbalance between the US and Japan could be reduced, in practice the
problems remain intractable.
During the eight years that the US Commerce Department has been keeping
records on trade in vehicles and parts, the US automotive deficit with Japan
has proved resistant to all efforts to reduce the imbalance. The deficit,
which totalled Dollars 32.6bn in 1986 fell slightly to Dollars 30.8bn in
1990 but by last year it had risen again to Dollars 33.4bn.
The inclusion 15 months ago of automotive components in the framework trade
talks between the US and Japan has yielded little other than increased
tension between the two sides. The US deficit in automotive components trade
with Japan rose to Dollars 11.2bn last year, a tenfold increase from the
1981 level.
Japanese carmakers warned recently that they would urge the Japanese
government to pursue Gatt actions including rights to compensation and
sanctioned retaliation, if the US were to impose sanctions under the Super
301 trade law in the case of a breakdown in the framework trade
negotiations.
William Duncan, general director of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers
Association (JAMA) in Washington, said that the short-term consequences of
an auto trade conflict would mean 'economic disruption, loss of employment
and ultimately slower growth and higher consumer costs'.
The US auto industry on the other hand has called on Washington to take
whatever steps it deems necessary to prod Japan to open its market, but it
has recently stopped short of calling for sanctions.
'We would like to see an open market in Japan, and we want the consumers in
Japan to have the same opportunities consumers in America have,' said Andrew
Card, president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, last
month.
Japanese carmakers have resisted calls for the setting of numerical targets
in trade between the US and Japan. 'I feel there is no need for targets,
because I have no doubt that if the US auto parts are of high enough
quality, reasonably priced and with good delivery records, then Japanese
automakers will buy them,' said Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Toyota and
chairman of JAMA in a recent interview.
The US believes that Japan gave a commitment during the visit by former
President George Bush to Tokyo in January 1992 to buy Dollars 19bn worth of
automotive components - Dollars 4bn for imports and Dollars 15bn for
purchases by Japanese vehicle plants in the US - in the year to the end of
March 1995. JAMA maintains, however, that the figure of Dollars 19bn was
based on the voluntary plans of individual carmakers and was not a
government target. Total purchases rose last year to Dollars 15.5bn and have
doubled in the past four years from Dollars 7.12bn in the year to March
1990.
In Europe, meanwhile, Japan is seeking to raise its quota for car and light
commercial vehicle exports to the EU as a result of higher than expected
demand in Europe.
In March, Tokyo and Brussels set a guideline under the joint monitoring
scheme allowing Japanese vehicle exports to the EU to rise by 0.4 per cent
to 984,000 in 1994. In the first eight months, however, new car sales in
west Europe have risen by 6 per cent, and Tokyo now wants to raise the level
of its shipments. Direct Japanese vehicle exports to the EU fell last year
by 18.4 per cent to 980,000 under the impact of the deep recession in the
new vehicle market.
Concerns are also being voiced in Brussels and Washington over growing
imbalances in vehicle trade with South Korea, which is increasing greatly
its domestic production capacity.
Last year imports accounted for only 0.19 per cent of Korea's car market.
Hyundai, the leading Korean carmaker, alone plans nearly to double its
European sales from less than 100,000 last year to 189,000 by the end of the
decade.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of New Broadcast and Communication Media (5): A
'bouquet of channels' - How pay television is starting to expand in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pay television continues to expand in continental Europe with the two main
established players, Canal Plus, the French-based broadcaster and FilmNet of
Belgium drawing up ambitious plans for international development.
Canal Plus, which has Europe's largest subscription television base - over
5.8m subscribers by the middle of this year - is hard at work preparing the
way for the launch of digital services, possibly by the end of next year,
looking at ways of breaking into the US cable market and also starting to
think about channels that could become global.
Last month the company reported an operating profit of FFr888m for the first
half of this year - an increase of 2.8 per cent on last time. FilmNet, owned
by Richemont, the tobacco and luxury goods company and M-Net International,
the South African pay television company, is considerably smaller than Canal
Plus but has started to expand in Europe from its first bases in the
Netherlands and Scandanavia.
At the beginning of this month FilmNet, which already has more than 700,000
subscribers across Europe, launched the first premium movie and sports
channel in Greece. The channel, broadcasting 24 hours a day, will be
available in the Athens and Thessaloniki region and has the potential to
reach around 50 per cent of the Greek population.
What is the first pay television channel in Greece will be operated by Super
Hellas, a local company which will bring together Greek investors and
Nethold, FilmNet's parent company. On the same day, another new FilmNet
channel was launched in Poland and central Europe, which means that the pay
television group now broadcasts different channels in Belgium, the
Netherlands, the Nordic countries, Poland, central Europe and Greece.
FilmNet, which began broadcasting in the Netherlands in 1985, specialises in
providing two channels for a single subscription - The Complete Movie
Channel which transmits films 24 hours a day and FilmNet Plus, which
combines films, sport, children's programmes and live entertainment. The
FilmNet parent Nethold is expanding its business across Europe with the
launch of MultiChoice, a company set up to offer a wide range of
subscription channels for satellite, cable and conventional broadcasts.
The 'bouquet' of channels offered by MultiChoice includes FilmNet, The
Discovery Channel, Country Music Television Europe, The Children's Channel,
The Adult Channel and QVC, the home shopping channel.
Apart from Belgium, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries MultiChoice
currently operates in Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia,
Croatia and Poland. This month Mr Jonathan Shier, former deputy managing
director and sales director of Thames Television, joins the MultiChoice
headquarters team at Hoofddorp in the Netherlands as managing director for
eastern and central Europe.
Earlier this year Richemont spent Dollars 180m acquiring a 25 per cent stake
in Telepiu, the Italian pay television operator which broadcasts two
encrypted pay television channels featuring films and sports events and one
unencrypted channel specialising in documentaries and cultural programmes.
For Canal Plus, which is active in both television and feature film
production, the challenge is to extend its dominance in terrestrial pay
television services to its newer satellite channels and on to the wider
choice that digital television, using compression technology, can offer.
Mr Claude Ravilly, executive vice president and chief financial officer of
Canal Plus, believes there will be more competition when digital television
arrives as more channels can be offered to the consumer. 'We believe we have
the ability to compete strongly because we know how to create programme
values and we know how to sell to homes and market subscriptions. It will be
difficult to compete with Canal Plus,' says Mr Ravilly.
Canal Plus has one problem to deal with, however. For the first time in its
history the main Canal Plus channel, which specialises in movies and sport,
had a significant shortfall between new subscriptions and cancellations in
the first half of this year. The latter totalled 170,000 while there were
139,000 new subscriptions. In the same period last year there was a net
growth of 36,000 subscribers. Mr Ravilly blames the shortfall on the
worsening economic climate in France.
He concedes that saturation point for Canal Plus in France may come at 4m to
4.4m subscribers. Canal Plus hopes the numbers will be boosted by the
continuing introduction of a new receiver box and smart card system which is
cutting the rate of piracy.
Where the new receiver has been introduced, there has been an average
increase of 10 per cent in subscriptions - in Toulouse, however, the growth
was 30 per cent, evidence of the scale of piracy in the area. In France the
group estimates that there will be 3.74m individual Canal Plus subscribers
by the end of this year.
The total Canal Plus universe, including services owned with partners in
Belgium, Spain, Germany and Africa is expected to exceed 6m by the end of
December. The forecast includes 950,000 subscribers in Spain and 900,000 in
Germany. In addition, Canalsatellite in which Compagnie General des Eaux has
a 30 per cent stake, is expected to have 200,000 subscribers.
The thematic channels offered by the Canalsatellite 'bouquet' satellite
channels, are designed for those who are unlikely to be able to get cable
television. The choice ranges from film channels and the French version of
Eurosport to the French music channel MCM to Canal J for children and Canal
Jimmy for young adults. It is a strong base from which to take on a major
future challenge.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of New Broadcast and Communication Media (3): A man
of heretical views - Interview with Philippe Galteau, General Cable's
managing director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Philippe Galteau, managing director of General Cable, is an unusual
executive in the British cable industry. He is, of course, a Frenchman
working for a subsidiary of Compagnie General des Eaux, the large French
services group, in an industry still dominated by North American money.
But more important than the fact that he is not an American are what he
describes as his heretical views on the future of the industry. In contrast
to cable television or even residential telephony, he places enormous
emphasis on developing business telephone services because of the high
revenues involved.
Mr Galteau regards video-on-demand, a concept that is exciting many cable
and satellite operators, as little more than 'a gadget, a dazzling thing'
that is not really essential for the financial development of the industry.
He is also sceptical about another of the latest industry buzzwords -
interactive television - because of the high costs involved and describes
himself as 'scandalised' by those putting a heavy emphasis on games or
bothering to show a single football game from a number of different camera
angles.
'Cable television is only one part of our activity and in the long term I
would be very surprised if it amounted to more than 40 per cent of our
revenues - and I think it is more likely to be one third rather than 40 per
cent,' he says. 'I would hope that the message that we are building
broadband networks rather than TV networks is going to grow,' he adds.
General Cable, founded in 1989, has three main stakes in the UK cable
industry. It owns 83 per cent of The Cable Corporation, which runs suburban
London franchises that also cover Heathrow, the Slough trading estate and
Windsor, and 45 per cent of the Birmingham Cable Corporation, which is
managed by another shareholder, Comcast. General Cable also has a 50-50
joint venture with Singapore Telecom in the Yorkshire Cable Group - one of
the largest cable franchises covering 875,000 homes and 50,000 businesses.
But it is TCC that demonstrates Mr Galteau's philosophy of cable most
clearly. Last year TCC had total revenues of Pounds 15.7m with 53 per cent
coming from business telephone services, 29 per cent from television and 18
per cent from residential telephones. Since 1991 the number of business
lines operated by TCC has grown from 2,639 to more than 7,500 now.
But Mr Galteau is fascinated by the ratios between what he regards as a
business with three quite distinct streams of revenue. If the monthly gross
margin on cable television services is 1, he argues, then the margin on a
residential telephone line is 1.4 but on each business line it is anything
between 5 and 7. The figures tip even further in favour of business
telephony because TCC's average business customer installs seven lines.
The result is that, in terms of revenue potential an average business
telephony customer could be worth anything from 40 to 50 times that of a
home taking just a cable television subscription where revenue levels are
also more finite than with telecommunications.
To get away from the generally disappointing figures for penetration of
cable television - the ratio of homes subscribing to those who could
subscribe - Mr Galteau has produced a new measure, 'combined penetration,'
which applies the different weightings for residential and business
telephony revenues to the figures. This means that while General Cable's
ordinary television penetration is 23 per cent, a bit ahead of the current
industry average of around 21 per cent, the weighted combined penetration
produces a figure of 68 per cent which Mr Galteau believes gives a more
accurate picture of the state of the business.
'Bankers are starting to understand,' says Mr Galteau who has been making
presentations to warm up the City of London for a possible flotation. That
could come some time next year, but would very much depend on market
conditions. The main aim would be to make General Cable a more British
company.
General Cable can already get access to debt finance and it has behind it
the fourth largest French company by market capitalisation, with a total
turnover of Pounds 17.4bn. Both TCC and Birmingham Cable Corporation reached
positive operating cash flow this year with Yorkshire, a much newer
franchise only 9 per cent built, forecasting positive cash flow in 1997.
Just as General Cable believes it has been a pioneer in the emphasis given
to business cable, so Birmingham Cable has been seen as a pioneer in the
marketing of residential services.
For several years Birmingham was the undisputed champion of the UK cable
industry and not only had the largest number of homes subscribing but also
the highest penetration rate in the industry. According to the latest
official statistics, Birmingham is, with 59,231 subscriptions, still the
franchise with the largest number of homes connected - 30,000 ahead of its
nearest rival, Portsmouth.
However, Birmingham's penetration rate has dropped to 31.4 per cent and it
is now second to Swindon's 32.4 per cent. Mr Ted Campbell, until earlier
this year managing director of Birmingham before moving to the Tyne Tees
franchise, says the Birmingham success has been based on attention to
detail. 'Unlike some systems, from the start, marketing has played a large
part in determining where we should build,' Mr Campbell explains.
The marketing campaign included making sure that every potential customer in
an area received a video of Birmingham cable's services. Sales staff were
also properly trained, paid and motivated so that staff turnover was
virtually nil.
The Birmingham franchise which covers 471,000 homes and 30,000 businesses is
now 40 per cent built and is due to be complete in 1997. By then it could be
the most powerful franchise in the country.
As for Mr Galteau, in General Cable's group headquarters not far from the
House of Commons the concept of cable remains a simple one - to achieve the
maximum revenues possible from every possible source from the millions spent
digging holes in the ground.

Telephony broadens cable's appeal - The challenge that the operators face
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's cable operators are generally called 'cable TV companies'. This is
a misnomer, for telephony is almost as important to them as television, and
they market the two services hand-in-hand. Indeed, of the three largest
cable operators in the UK, one - Nynex - is a regional Bell phone company in
the US, while the other two - Telewest and Bell Cablemedia - are joint
ventures between telecommunications and cable operators.
The confusion is explained partly by the fact that telephony came later than
television. Until 1991, telephony in the UK was a duopoly between British
Telecommunications and Mercury, a rival to BT set up in 1982.
One of the principal aims behind the abolition of the duopoly was the
promotion of competition in local phone services by encouraging cable
operators to lay telephone wires down the same ducts as their TV cables.
Mercury's network is for long-distance traffic, and relied on BT for local
access to all but a small number of very large users. To further encourage
the cable companies, the government banned BT from using its existing
network to offer broadcast entertainment services to the residential market.
Those two steps - the BT ban and the abolition of the duopoly - made cable
investment a far more attractive commercial proposition than previously. But
most of the cable operators were surprised at the take-off of cable
telephony.
At the beginning of September, the cable operators had sold 534,000
telephone lines, about 54,000 of them business lines and the rest
residential. That compared with 745,000 cable TV subscribers.
Some cable operators now boast more telephone than TV subscribers. Nynex,
the second largest operator, claims that 25 per cent of the homes it has
passed in its Portsmouth franchise now take cable telephone, against 22 per
cent taking cable TV. A year ago, 58 per cent of new customers were taking
both products; now it is up to 70 per cent.
The social make-up of cable customers is changing too. When cable was
clearly TV-led, it had strongest appeal in areas of low-income housing where
the extra TV channels were particularly popular. Telephony is broadening
cable's appeal. 'At the prosperous end of the demographic continuum we are
now selling well above average,' says Mr Peter Lynch, Nynex's director of
residential marketing. Sales are below average among older residents, 'but
it is a more a concern about change, not a clear socio-economic divide,' he
believes.
BT is clearly worried by the success of cable companies in luring away some
of its more affluent customers. Mr Michael Hepher, BT's managing director,
brands cable the most serious of BT's competitors for the medium and long
term. 'Whereas with Mercury we lose the long-distance revenue but keep the
line connection, with the cable companies we lose that too - and with it the
opportunity to sell and market all our services.'
BT has set up 'cable defence' teams to target urban areas where cable
companies are building their networks. It has also launched a high-profile
campaign to secure a lifting of the entertainment ban, claiming that it
could generate local cable monopolies unless lifted soon. BT executives are
also concerned that BT cannot vary its prices regionally, fearing that as
price competition intensifies BT will be disabled by the requirement to
charge the same for a local call in Portsmouth as in the Scottish Highlands.
However, the 'cable threat' needs to be put in perspective. BT has 27m lines
and 85 per cent of the UK's telecoms market. It is currently adding new
lines at a faster rate than the cable companies: its net monthly growth is
running at about 60,000 lines against 40,000 for the cable companies. BT has
a mobile phone offshoot, Cellnet, which alone has 1.2m subscribers - more
than twice as many as all the cable phone users put together.
Furthermore, the entertainment ban is unlikely to endure indefinitely. The
House of Commons trade and industry select committee recently urged the
government to set a firm date of 2002 for lifting the ban. Even the Cable
Television Association accepts that the cable industry has little to gain
from continued uncertainty.
'BT is in a very strong position, which is not seriously jeopardised by the
cable operators,' says Mr Laurence Heyworth, telecoms analyst with Robert
Fleming, the brokers. BT trades heavily on its customer service, which is
generally accepted to be good. By contrast, some cable operators have had
serious teething troubles with their billing and fault-repair systems.
Even fiercer price competition may work to BT's advantage: as the price
differential between BT and its rivals falls, so does the incentive for
customers to switch from one supplier to another.
Already, price differentials are often small, especially for long-distance
calls. Straight price comparisons are problematic, given the multiplicity of
cable operators. But generally speaking, while cable line rental charges are
lower than for BT, and local charges cheaper, the price of long-distance
calls is not much different between cable and Mercury using a BT connection.
In some franchises long-distance calls are actually cheaper if made by
Mercury via a BT line than by cable. Tariff sheets resemble railway
timetables, so only the most dedicated of residential customers will be
inclined or able to work out such differences. For most customers, headline
savings are all. For now, cable company claims that they are around 10 to 15
per cent cheaper for a typical BT phone bill appear to be holding sway, but
they may not continue to do so.
The challenge for the cable companies is to become more than a 'cheap BT' as
telecoms suppliers. On the residential side, pay-per-view and
video-on-demand services across telecoms wires are being tested, with
operators promising commercial services in the near future. But dates are
vague, and precise prices for such services have yet to be revealed.
At the outset cable operators concentrated on the residential market, where
joint marketing of TV and telephony appeared to have most to offer. They are
now taking the business sector seriously. London's operators have come
together in a 'London Interconnect' consortium, and offer city-wide datacoms
services. Videotron, which holds a telephony franchise in Westminster and
City, has launched a desk-top television/information service, upgrading PCs
with a special card to give users access to TV and information databases on
their screens.
But the corporate sector is the fiercest part of the telecoms market, with a
host of new operators - most of them US-owned - building networks and
offering services. At least in the residential sector the cable companies
have only BT to fight.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of New Broadcast and Communication Media (4): TV,
businessmen start to turn on - A new genre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Movies and news have been the main drivers of international cable and
satellite television around the globe and the main battleground for
competing media giants. A new genre of programmes may, after many
difficulties, be emerging as a new candidate to join the list - business
television.
Everyone, of course, wants to reach high-spending international businessmen
but they tend to be an elusive lot - often on the move and light television
watchers.
Now from the US and Europe to Asia, companies such as Dow Jones, publishers
of the Wall Street Journal, NBC, the US network company and Reuters, the
international news and information group, are targeting television aimed at
the business community as a growth area.
However, the genre breaks down into two quite specific streams of
programming - the general business, financial and industrial channel aimed
at satellite and cable networks, and the much more specialist services aimed
precisely at the screens of dealers.
Some plan to cut costs by offering both types of service simultaneously. For
example Dow Jones, in a joint venture with Flextech, the cable programmer,
plans to launch a European Business News channel on the Eutelsat satellite
system next February and run a service for market professionals.
Even apart from the two Dow Jones services, the City of London looks like
being one of the liveliest battlegrounds for the new services to business
over the next few years.
Videotron, the Canadian-owned cable company which has more than 88,000 cable
television subscribers in the UK, last month announced that it would launch
a comprehensive range of business television services for the City of London
and Westminster areas.
The company has been awarded a licence to offer competing telecommunications
services in the area because the local cable licence is held by British
Telecommunications.
It is building a dedicated Pounds 38m network to tap into the heavy
communications traffic in an area with 37,000 businesses. But, as well as
telecommunications, Videotron will have 48 channels of television available
to provide non-entertainment services to the business market, direct to
computer screens on businessmen's desks.
Reuters will provide a special news service to Videotron subscribers in
addition to the specialist information service, and the system will also
carry CNN, NBC SuperChannel, EuroNews and the Parliamentary Channel, with
more programming likely to follow.
At the same time, Reuters Financial Television, launched in May and aimed at
foreign exchange, debt and treasury financial markets across Europe, is
continuing to expand. Apart from morning briefing, Reuters Financial
Television stays off the air until there is potentially market-moving
information to broadcast direct to dealers' screens.
As Mr Mark Wood, editor-in-chief of Reuters, puts it, extensive research
showed financial professionals 'did not want television - they want video
information that is useful.' Mr Wood remains sceptical about the economics
of more general channels.
At the same time, NBC SuperChannel, which believes it can reach 60m homes in
Europe, former Soviet states, the Middle East and north Africa through cable
networks and terrestrial retransmission, is about to change its programming
format. It will turn itself into a largely business news channel at least
during the day. From January 3 the channel will broadcast European Money
Wheel, five hours of business news and information on weekday mornings. An
agreement has already been signed under which FT-TV, part of the Financial
Times Group, will provide the European Money Wheel segment.
When the New York markets open - in the European afternoon - the channel
will carry CNBC, the successful US business channel. There is also the
possibility of going 24 hours a day with business by adding an Asian Money
Wheel.
The intensity of television business news competition in Europe is likely to
be matched in other regions.
In the US Dow Jones has already launched a specialist channel for market
professionals, the Dow Jones Investor Network, and is now looking at the
possibility of adding a more general business channel to challenge CNBC.
In Asia, where the Asia Business News channel has been broadcasting for
nearly a year and is available in 12m to 16m homes, there have already been
experiments on providing an additional, more specialist service.
Before too long, if all the existing channels survive, worldwide business
networks may be created so that business television at least begins to
aspire to the boast of Cable News Network - that it is available everywhere
(apart maybe from parts of Antartica and Greenland).

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (1): Car producers race for
global presence - Kevin Done finds that, as the existing order begins to
disintegrate, vehicle producers are being forced to embark on radical
restructuring of their operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The US will overtake Japan this year to become the world's top vehicle
producing nation for the first time since 1979. The existing order is
changing rapidly, and the world's carmakers are having to cope with an era
of unprecedented upheaval, as the auto industry becomes a truly global
business.
Japanese vehicle output has declined under the impact of three successive
years of recession in the domestic market, falling from 13.5m in 1990 to
11.2m last year.
At the same time US production has grown from 8.8m in 1991 to 10.9m last
year in response to the strong recovery in North American new vehicle
demand. The diverging trends have continued this year.
Alongside the changing fortunes of the two leading producing countries,
however, another important development is taking place.
Japanese vehicle manufacturers have transferred more and more production out
of Japan during the past decade, first to North America, and more recently
to Europe and to south-east Asia, contributing to a significant shift of
production capacity. The new ascendancy of the US as a vehicle production
force owes much to the Japanese vehicle makers themselves.
The Big Three US car producers General Motors, Ford and Chrysler have
themselves restructured in drastic fashion in recent years to regain world
competitiveness. Their fortunes have revived, but their domestic hegemony is
under challenge. About 15 per cent of US vehicle production is now coming
from Japanese carmakers' plants (either wholly-owned or in joint ventures)
compared with none little more than a decade ago.
Japanese carmakers now operate 11 assembly plants and three engine plants in
North America. Honda is one of the main US car exporters. Since the early
1980s the Japanese have built in the US an auto industry larger than that of
Britain Italy or Spain and almost the size of the French industry. Similar
developments are under way in Europe. Japanese producers currently account
for about a quarter of UK car production. Last year Nissan became the
leading UK car exporter.
Economic pressures and the appreciation of the yen are hastening the
Japanese expansion overseas, and in recent weeks both Toyota and Honda have
announced plans to expand further their production bases in North America.
Honda is increasing its car assembly capacity in the US and Canada from
610,000 to 720,000 a year by 1997, and it will begin assembly in Mexico next
year. It is planning to increase its exports from the US and Canada to more
than 150,000 a year by 1999.
It is already unchallenged as the leading US car exporter to Japan, selling
four times more US-built cars in Japan than its nearest American rival, GM,
in the first seven months this year. Honda does not disclose the cost
differences between its Japanese and its US-built cars, but it admitted
recently that 'at the current exchange rate the North American vehicles are
far more profitable'.
The race for global scale in the auto industry has been engaged in earnest,
and the challenge is eliciting dynamic and surprising responses, that are
breaking accepted moulds in the world industry.
Ford, the world's second largest vehicle maker, has embarked this year on a
sweeping restructuring of its global organisation in the most radical
shake-up in its 91-year history. By the end of December it plans to have
merged its European and North American automotive operations and its
automotive components group into a single operating unit, Ford Automotive
Operations.
The restructuring is aimed at optimising Ford's resources, at eliminating
the duplication of effort in Europe and in North America and at preparing
for future growth. The group is seeking to achieve 'the lowest possible
coefficient of bureaucratic drag,' says Alex Trotman, Ford chairman and
chief executive. He claims that the simplification of engineering,
purchasing, and technical and other processes will substantially reduce
operating costs and could lead to savings of at least Dollars 2bn-Dollars
3bn a year by the end of the decade.
The Volkswagen group, Europe's biggest vehicle maker, is also going through
corporate turmoil, as it seeks to staunch record losses and to shed its
unenviable position as the highest cost producer in Europe.
In a radical restructuring of its new car development and engineering
operations it is planning to reduce the number of basic chassis platforms -
from which all its car ranges are derived - from a present total of 16 to
only four by the early years of the next decade in order to cut costs and
simplify its global manufacturing activities.
The strategy will embrace all four makes in the group, Volkswagen, Audi,
Seat and Skoda, and will eventually have a big impact on its global
manufacturing operations from Germany to Spain, the Czech Republic, Brazil,
Mexico, China and South Africa.
Mercedes-Benz, perhaps the world's most prestigious maker of luxury cars,
has embarked on a fundamental re-alignment of its new product strategy. By
the late 1990s the company will have launched a range of vehicles into new
segments of the world market including a four-wheel drive sport/utility
vehicle to be assembled in a new plant in the US, a small family car, sized
between a Volkswagen Golf and a Ford Fiesta, and most surprisingly a micro
compact car, a two-seater car for urban commuting that it is developing in a
joint venture with SMH, the Swiss maker of Swatch watches.
Inevitably the restructuring in the world auto industry is also leading to
new alliances and mergers, although the progress is not always smooth.
In a further concentration of the European auto industry BMW of Germany took
over the Rover group, the leading UK vehicle maker, from British Aerospace
earlier this year in an Pounds 800m deal, which has doubled its production
volume. The much-heralded alliance of Renault, the French state-owned
carmaker, and Volvo of Sweden collapsed, however, leaving both companies to
look for other partners.
In the scramble for global position the world's leading carmakers are also
having to fight to establish a presence in the world's newly emerging
markets.
The industry is united in the view that the Asia Pacific region holds the
brightest prospects, and automotive sales in Asia (excluding Japan) are
expected to triple during the next 15 years.
According to Mr Trotman around 80 per cent of the world's population lives
outside the traditional automotive markets of west Europe, North America and
Japan, but the number of cars and trucks sold in these regions represents
only about 8 per cent of the world's total.
For a long time the US vehicle makers - as well as the Europeans - neglected
Asian markets allowing them to become largely the preserve of their Japanese
rivals, but belatedly they are seeking to regain lost ground.
General Motors of the US, the world's leading vehicle maker, for example, is
using Opel, its German subsidiary to spearhead its expansion into
international car markets outside North America and in particular into Asia.
Assembly of Opel cars began in Taiwan last year, production has started in
Indonesia this year and will begin in India in the third quarter of 1995.
The world's leading vehicle makers are queueing up to establish assembly
projects in China, where Volkswagen of Germany and the PSA Peugeot Citroen
group of France have stolen a lead. In general, the European car industry
has been far more parochial and dependent on its home market than its US and
Japanese rivals, but it, too, is now on the move with new production
projects under development in the US, Latin America and Asia.
For now, it is the Big Three US carmakers, GM, Ford and Chrysler that are
earning record profits, while their European and Japanese rivals struggle to
emerge from losses and recession. Behind the fluctuating trade cycles and
volatile financial returns, however, all three regions' carmakers are
struggling with the same issue of how to build a global presence in the
world car market.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of New Broadcast and Communication Media (1): The
audiences are spoilt for choice - Raymond Snoddy finds that the convergence
between entertainment, computing and telecommunications is at last beginning
to happen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month, after years of planning DirecTV finally completed a television
satellite system with the power to broadcast 150 channels of entertainment
over the entire American continent.
The broadcaster, part of the Hughes Aircraft Company, launched the first 60
channels in June and then moved on September 19 to 150 channels after the
successful launch of a second RCA satellite.
Suddenly for those in rural areas without a cable television service, or
even without television at all, the choice ranges from the Arts and
Entertainment Network, Bloomberg Direct and Cartoon Network to the Turner
Classic Movies, The Weather Channel and USA Network, with more on the way.
There are seven themed movie channels and 28 digital audio channels, not to
mention the pay-per-view service offering up to 50 channels of movies,
sports and special events, with Hollywood films starting as often as every
30 minutes.
DirecTV declines to say how many subscribers the system has so far, but it
claims that the Dollars 700 decoders, complete with 18-inch dishes, 'are
flying off the shelves'.
The system indicates how the revolution in communications and entertainment
is gathering pace throughout the developed and even the not-so-developed
world.
Mr Rupert Murdoch's Hong Kong-based Star TV will next year launch a
satellite system also with a capacity of up to 150 channels, using digital
compression technology, developed in conjunction with NTL, the privatised
engineering division of the IBA, that can squeeze 10 channels of television
into the space now occupied by one. The initial plan is to run up to 40
channels, many in Asian languages.
SES, the Luxembourg company that operates the Astra satellites, plans to
launch its fourth 16-channel satellite at the end of this month, followed by
two digital satellites, the first next year and the second in 1996.
If all goes well, Europe too will have its 150-channel system, and to the
now established range of thematic channels, catering for sports enthusiasts
and children, will be added pay-per-view movies in some form or another.
Almost every day, new channels are being launched to boost the multi-channel
revolution. Over the past 10 days FilmNet, the Belgian-based pay television
service, has started up subscription channels in Greece and Poland and in
the UK five new satellite services have come on stream, including a British
version of the American music channel VH-1, a mature version of MTV.
MTV, which claims to be the largest television network in the world,
reaching 250m homes in 63 countries, is at work on two new Asian channels.
One 24-hour channel will be in Mandarin and aimed at China, Taiwan and
Singapore. The other will be an English language service with some Hindi
programming for India and south-east Asia.
However, the extra choice goes far beyond entertainment as both news and
business news channels expand.
The BBC, encouraged by the government to play a commercial role abroad in
addition to its public service responsibilities at home, is increasingly
taking its World Television News service around the globe in competition
with Mr Ted Turner's Cable News Network.
Early next year the corporation, in a partnership with Pearson, the media
group that owns the Financial Times, plans to launch two satellite channels
in Europe - one devoted to news and the other to entertainment. In the
summer the BBC also began, under contract, a 24-hour television news service
in Arabic for the Middle East.
The choice of business news is expanding dramatically - apart from regular
business coverage from CNN.
The CNBC business channel is already successful in the US. Now NBC
SuperChannel is about to give it much greater business focus with the launch
next year of the European Money Wheel segment of programming in the morning
and the relay of CNBC in the afternoons. Early next year Dow Jones,
publishers of the Wall Street Journal, and Flextech will launch European
News. They are backing a similar service in Asia, and both Dow Jones in the
US and Reuters, the international news and information group, are providing
a subscription service direct to the computer screens of market
professionals.
When it makes little differ- ence whether business news is obtained from a
computer screen or a TV screen, it is clear that the importance of the new
media goes far beyond extra channels of entertain- ment. There are frequent
signs that the long-predicted convergence between enter- tainment, computing
and tele- communications is at last hap- pening, even though the elec-
tronic superhighway probably excites politicians more than consumers at the
moment.
Cable, satellite and video cassettes will have a growing number of rivals to
communicate words, pictures and ideas.
The Internet has come from almost nowhere to become a significant medium of
communication. According to some estimates, by the end of last year more
than 7,000 CD-Rom titles were available. By the end of this year over 10m
CD-Rom drives are expected to have been installed.
New uses are being developed for old networks. British Telecom has already
completed trials for digital video-on-demand services, using ordinary
telephone lines. A full commercial trial, taking in about 2,500 homes, is
due to get under way early next year.
In the UK the cable industry argues that, while others only talk, it is at
work laying the superhighway, encouraged by the fact that British cable
companies can offer business and residential telecommunications as well as
extra television channels.
Already more than Pounds 1.5bn (out of a planned Pounds 10bn) has been
invested in cable networks with the three largest players, TeleWest, a joint
venture between US West and TCI; Nynex, the New York telephone company; and
Bell Cablemedia owning franchises covering 7m homes.
The penetration rates for cable television - the ratio between those who can
subscribe and those who actually do - has stayed stubbornly low at about
21.5 per cent. But the speed at which new networks are being built means
that even if the average penetration rate does not rise, the number of cable
subscribers in the UK is likely to exceed the 1m mark by the turn of the
year.
Apart from developing telecommunications services, the cable companies are
encouraging the growth of more cable exclusive programming to try to boost
penetration rates.
Channel One, a 24 hours a day television news channel to be launched by
Associated Newspapers at the end of next month, will be available on the
London Interconnect that links all the cable franchises in London. It should
then spread to similar groupings of franchises in the Midlands and in the
north of England.
Last month the Mirror Group, publisher of the Daily Mirror, announced that
it too would launch a cable channel, Live TV, based on entertainment and
live events.
While cable is growing in the UK, British Sky Broadcasting is also expanding
and plans to launch its first video-on-demand services next year.
In August BSkyB announced operating profits of Pounds 170m for the year to
June and said then that its total number of paying subscribers was 3.45m, of
which satellite dishes accounted for 74 per cent.
There have been disputes about the size of the BSkyB audience but the latest
figures from GfK, the marketing group, which excludes cable from its
figures, suggest there were 2.716m satellite dishes in the UK at the end of
August.
Yet, despite the growing excitement about superhighways and new television
channels, what is remarkable is how resilient many of the traditional
broadcasters are.
In the US, for instance, both Time Warner and Paramount, now owned by
Viacom, are interested in starting their own networks. And NBC and CBS are
considered attractive takeover targets again, partly because the rules
preventing the networks owning both their own shows and the syndication
rights have been lifted.
In the UK, even though the number of channels has more than doubled, the new
channels rarely get more than a third of the viewing in cable and satellite
homes. The latest figures for the week ending September 18 show a 31.7 per
cent share for the new channels, with the seven Sky channels taking 17.4 per
cent.
Indeed, as more and more entertainment choices became available, European
cinema enjoyed what Screen Digest recently called 'a boom of almost
unprecedented proportions' in 1993 - its best year at the box office since
1954.

FT  04 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Pearson optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Media conglomerate Pearson stood out as the best performer in the FT-SE 100
as investors responded to press speculation that BSkyB, the satellite group
in which Pearson has around 17 per cent, would be the subject of a Pounds
5bn flotation.
The story was published in the Sunday Times, which is owned by Mr Rupert
Murdoch who also owns 50 per cent of BSkyB. It encouraged SG Warburg to
upgrade its calculation for the contribution BSkyB makes to Pearson's share
price by 32p to 160p and recommend the Financial Times owner at its morning
meeting. The house forecast for Pearson shares is now 712p and the stock
closed 17 stronger at 599p.
Leisure and rental group Granada, holder of a 13.5 per cent stake in BSkyB,
ended a penny firmer at 510p, as analysts focused on the prospect of a
windfall of between Pounds 450m and Pounds 500m to the company should a
stake sale go ahead.
News that food retailer J. Sainsbury had bought 50 per cent of the voting
stock of US supermarket chain Giant Food for Dollars 325m helped the shares
resist the market slide.
The shares have been under a cloud in recent sessions on continuing fears of
a price war among food retailers, but the stock was back in favour
yesterday. The shares touched 409p before renewed fears of a price war and
the weak market, particularly in the second half of the session, saw the
stock surrender the earlier gain to close 1 1/2 up at 402p.
Mr Bill Myers at Yamaichi said: 'The market was half expecting an
acquisition. This one is in the right place geographically and is a quality
outfit.'
The attention of the rest of the sector focused on the intensifying
supermarket price battle as Argyll Group's Safeway supermarket chain
launched a Pounds 7m advertising campaign and Asda Group announced a price
freeze on 7,000 grocery and non-food items until at least January 1995.
Argyll slipped 4 1/2 to 270p, while the latter relinquished 3 1/4 to 62 1/4
p in trade of 5.7m.
Comments by shadow chancellor Mr Gordon Brown that a Labour government would
impose a 'windfall tax' on the profits of privatised utilities sent a chill
through the shares of the regional electricity companies.
The worst hit included Midlands Electricity, down 37 at 701p, Eastern
Electricity, which tumbled 35 to 707p, and London Electricity, which fell 34
to 651p.
Vodafone failed to climb above the weak market sentiment in spite of a very
strong showing from new connections in its second quarter. The shares dipped
3 1/2 to 194p in 6.4m trading volume.
The group took in 277,000 gross subscribers in the quarter, up from 98,000 a
year ago, with digital connections accounting for one-third of new
connections in September.
Medeva, the pharmaceuticals group, rose 5 to 153p as the market responded to
a positive presentation by the company in the US and a recommendation from
Panmure Gordon.
Both British Aerospace and nuclear submarine maker VSEL moved sharply lower
as they awaited official confirmation of widely anticipated takeover talks.
The former fell 6 1/2 to 442p and the latter weakened 32 to 1178p. VSEL is
now 72p short of the price that most securities houses have been putting on
any potential offer from BAe.
Housebuilders lost ground following the Nationwide Building Society's gloomy
view of house prices in September. Barratt shed 4 to 138p and George Wimpey
slipped a similar amount to 134p.
Among building materials, BPB held steady at 302p, helped by a buy
recommendation from BZW.
Plant hire shares were in demand, with Ashtead bouncing 7 to 437p on the
back of a confident statement.
A profits warning from retailer Shoprite left the shares trailing 4 at 28p.

FT  04 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Banks hit by profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A deeply disturbing profits warning from SG Warburg, one of the UK's leading
integrated securities houses, pushed panic buttons among investors and
analysts.
The shares responded by plunging more than 15 per cent to hit their lowest
level since the beginning of last year as analysts cut forecasts.
By the time the smoke had cleared the stock was down 101 at 569p with 4.3m
shares traded and beginning to look relatively cheap, according to some
banking specialists. Nevertheless, with the market capitalisation already
putting the bank at the bottom of the FT-SE 100, its future in the blue chip
index looked precarious.
Warburg announced that profits expectations of around Pounds 140m for the
six months to September would be disappointed and the figure was more likely
to be between Pounds 55m and Pounds 65m.
There was much speculation as to what lay behind the downgrade. Warburg
cited difficulties in equity and fixed income trading, but some dealers said
the big falls in global bond and stock markets had occurred before the March
year-end. It was suggested that the house might have lost heavily in its
risk manage-ent business, particularly derivatives.
Downgrades followed swiftly. James Capel moved to the bottom of the range,
reducing its full-year estimate by Pounds 100m, to Pounds 140m. Credit
Lyonnais Laing took a more optimistic stance, lowering its forecast by
Pounds 72m to Pounds 158m. However, the most shocked appeared to be NatWest
Securities, which had seen Warburg as the best of a bad bunch. The house cut
by Pounds 145m, to Pounds 155m, and moved its recommendation from 'add' to
'hold'.
Laing, formerly a strong bear of the stock, took the opposite view and
upgraded to a more neutral stance. Analyst Mr Martin Hughes argued that with
staff salaries averaging Pounds 105,000, the high cost base compared to
rival houses would hit profits when revenues were down, but the bank's net
worth was now offering support.
The Warburg statement turned the spotlight on to other investment banks as
well as clearing banks with investment arms. Smith New Court, which has a
very strong marketmaking presence, dropped 40 to 334p. Schroders, the
merchant bank, shed 43 to 1335p, with concern focusing on its Wertheim arm.
Clearers National Westminster and Barclays fell 8 1/2 to 479p and 11 1/2 to
559p respectively, although analysts said their strong presence in more
stable foreign exchange markets would offer protection.

FT  04 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE drops after disturbing economic
news - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A combination of disturbing economic news from both sides of the Atlantic,
plus a worrying profits warning from SG Warburg, the UK merchant bank, cast
a shadow across the London stock market.
The FT-SE 100 Index once more plunged through the 3,000 level, closing a net
42.8 lower at 2,983.5. The retreat by the market front-line stocks was
matched by the second-tier issues, where the FT-SE Mid 250 Index dropped
45.2 to 3,449.6.
Adding to the gloom surrounding the market was news emerging from the Labour
party conference in Blackpool that a Labour government would introduce a
windfall profits tax on the privatised util-ities such as electricity and
water companies whose profits have surged since being taken out of public
ownership.
The pattern of trading in the market was set at the outset when dealers
chopped their opening prices after SG Warburg, regarded as the most
successful integrated securities house in the City since Big Bang, issued a
warning that interim profits would be severely affected by the extreme
turbulence in international markets in recent months. This news, which
followed warnings last week of low turnover from Sharelink, the
execution-only stockbroker, saw marketmakers carve around 16 per cent from
the Warburg share price and triggered a broad mark-down of prices across the
market, especially in the financial areas.
Shortly after the market had absorbed the Warburg news, it had to cope with
worrying money supply figures. MO, the narrow money supply indicator,
expanded by 1 per cent during September, well ahead of the expected 0.4 per
cent increase and giving a year-on-year rise of 7.1 per cent. This brought
additional pressure to bear on a gilts market which opened in good shape but
was quickly worn down by a poor performance by German bunds which, in turn,
reflected growing unease after the latest opinion poll ratings for the
October 16 federal election.
With gilts slipping away, the gloom in the stock market deepened and the
FT-SE 100, which opened only two points easier, quickly fell to show a drop
in excess of 32 points by midday.
Debt markets fared worse with the announcement of a higher than expected
National Purchasing Managers' index, which served to increase worries in the
US of further inflationary pressures. Dealers took the view that evidence
this Friday of increasing economic activity in the US, via a steeper than
expected fall in unemployment, would push the US Federal Reserve into
another increase in US interest rates. The general consensus was that a rise
of more than 250,000 in US non-farm payrolls on Friday would produce steep
falls in world markets unless the Fed moved to lift US rates.
At its worst, the FT-SE 100 Index was down 43.9, affected by an early slide
in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, before its subsequent close. But there
remained very little confidence in a UK market which one strategist said is
being 'tortured by fears of inflation across the globe'.
Marketmakers, bruised by the recent excessive volatility in markets,
remained bearish in the short term. 'We are reaching a climax of bearishness
in this market but you would have to be very brave to call the bottom,' said
one weary dealer. He expected support for the FT-SE 100 at the 2,950 level.
The Warburg warning produced hefty losses across the merchant banks and
clearing banks with big trading teams, while shares in Smith New Court, the
UK's premier marketmaking firm, were badly affected.
Reports of a Pounds 5bn flotation of BSkyB produced strong support for
Pearson and Granada, two of the big shareholders in the satellite television
group.

FT  04 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures fell steeply, leading the cash market lower for most of
the day with premiums to cash equities narrowing at times to little more
than two points, writes Jeffrey Brown.
Turnover was heavy with volume at the official 4.10pm close running to
15,099 contracts, against 14,599 on Friday. Unlike the cash market, futures
traders had an active day.
The FT-SE December contract closed 49 points lower at 2,993. This was at
least above the day's low of 2,987 which was touched in the final hour of
trading.
At the close the premium to the cash market was 9.5 points with the fair
value premium extending to around 16 points.
Selling pressure was mostly heavy throughout the session, forcing the
December contract down to a level at times close to parity with the cash
market.
Traders said a number of hard-nosed bear runs had been made with the locals
 -independent traders - leading the charge. Institutional business remained
non-existent.
Traded option turnover also bounded ahead, rising from 22,036 lots on Friday
to 35,586 lots. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume accounted for 22,822 lots.
Scottish Power was the most actively traded individual stock option at 1,356
lots, with HSBC also active.

FT  04 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): NAPM data leave Dow subdued
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks were mixed yesterday as investors reacted to further evidence of a
resilient economy, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 3.70 up at 3,846.89 after crossing
into positive territory in the final half-hour of the session. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 closed 0.95 off at 461.74 and the Nasdaq composite lost 3.41 at
760.88. NYSE turnover was 278.4m shares.
A negative tone was established soon after the first session of the new
quarter got under way, with the release of more data suggesting unmanageable
economic acceleration. The National Association of Purchasing Management
said its September index of activity in the manufacturing sector rose to
58.2 per cent from the previous month's 56.2 per cent.
Even more worrying for the inflation-sensitive bond market was that the
prices component of the survey climbed to a six-year high. As a consequence,
the Treasury market backtracked after picking up some ground in the early
going. Those gains were a response to the partial accord reached by US and
Japanese trade negotiators at the weekend.
However, the relief on trade could not offset the anxieties over monetary
policy. For most of the morning, equities closely followed the declines in
bonds, as the day's economic news reinforced suspicions that the Federal
Reserve was about to lift interest rates for the sixth time this year.
During the afternoon the Dow demonstrated a measure of independence and
staged a minor comeback on the strength of two cyclical issues.
Alcoa added Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 85 7/8 , extending a steady climb which
has paralleled with the recent rise in raw material prices. Goodyear Tire
put on Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 34 1/2 following favourable comments by
analysts last week.
Advanced Micro Devices dropped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 26 5/8 even though
it announced a 41 per cent improvement in third-quarter net income.
Investors sold the stock because the company said its future earnings would
suffer because of pricing pressures.
On the Nasdaq, CareNetwork surged Dollars 13 1/8 to Dollars 24 after Humana
agreed to acquire the Milwaukee-based health maintenance organisation in a
deal valued at Dollars 123m.
Information America jumped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 5 3/4 on news of an
agreement to merge with privately held West Publishing.
Canada
Toronto ended slightly lower after another cautious day of light trading, as
the market begins to absorb a heavy diet of economic news out of the US this
month, including yesterday's strong US NAPM report which put the spotlight
on inflation once again.
The TSE 300 index was finally off 9.47 at 4,344.71 and falls led rises by
418 to 298 after volume of 43.5m shares.
Mexico
A fresh fall of 2.2 per cent on the bolsa yesterday was attributed almost
entirely to investor revaluations of the political situation in Mexico
following weekend revelations that a congressman allegedly ordered last
week's killing of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, secretary-general of the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party. There is also widespread belief
that Mexican drug cartels are involved in the assassination. The IPC index
closed 60.10 points down at 2,686.01.

FT  04 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico and Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico and Malaysia were the strongest performers among World Index
constituents in the third quarter of 1994, each rising by 18.5 per cent; but
last week they put on the weakest showing with falls of 3.9 and 3.8 per cent
respectively, and in Malysia's case, profit-taking was the main reason. In
Mexico, the biggest single depressant was the assassination of Mr Jose
Francisco Ruiz Matthieu, a senior ruling party official; this, says Foreign
&amp; Colonial Emerging Markets, has swung investor focus back to the issue of
internal political reforms.
Senior bourses in continental Europe shuddered as poor half-year results
from Alcatel Alsthom threatened the theory that cyclical stocks still had
something to offer. Germany, with a heavy cyclicals influence, led the way
down with a fall of 3.5 per cent in local curency terms.

FT  04 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Telecom pressures Nikkei
as Taipei remains at high
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A further and accelerated decline in Japan Telecom depressed market
sentiment and, in spite of a moderate rise for the Nikkei 225 average,
trading volume registered its third lowest figure this year, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The index ended 86.22 firmer at 19,650.03 after a high for the day of
19,672.53 in the morning session and a low of 19,571.01 in the afternoon.
Share prices improved on a higher futures market, but most investors
remained inactive.
Volume totalled 158m shares, against 225m. Dealers and public funds held the
sidelines, and corporate investors were also absent. Many brokers, hurt by
the low trading activity, are hoping for some activity over the next few
weeks. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities commented: 'It could be the calm
before the storm. It is time share prices went either up or down.'
The Topix index gained 2.11 at 1,579.00, while the Nikkei 300 edged up 0.56
to 288.95, but declining issues led rises by 471 to 428, with 248 stocks
unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.67 firmer at 1,296.63.
The decline of Japan Telecom to a new low since its listing on September 6
depressed investor confidence. The stock was finally Y110,000 off at Y3.87m
after falling to a low of Y3.83m.
The stock's performance is crucial to investor confidence ahead of the
listing of Japan Tobacco shares later this month. Payments for the stock by
investors who won the lottery for the public offering are due to be made a
week from today; but traders expect many investors to waive the purchase if
Japan Telecom keeps on falling.
Japan Airlines slipped Y12 to Y735 following reports that the company will
record Y45bn in unrealised losses in the first half due to forward exchange
rate contracts.
Automobile shares gained ground on strong car sales. The Japan Automobile
Dealers Association said car sales in September rose by 6.4 per cent from a
year earlier, their fourth consecutive gain. Toyota Motor advanced Y20 to
Y2,050 and Honda Motor added Y20 at Y1,670.
Mitsubishi Electric rose Y11 to Y713 after an upward revision of its
earnings estimate for the current year, while Mitsubishi Oil put on Y30 at
Y1,100 on projections of doubled profits from a year earlier.
Former state owned companies were lower. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
receded Y9,000 to Y871,000 and East Japan Railway Y7,000 to Y478,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 11.15 to 21,996.28 in volume of 19m
shares.
Roundup
Pacific Rim markets were subject to mixed influences. Seoul was closed for a
public holiday.
TAIPEI posted a second straight four-year high in active trading, led by
financials and foods. The weighted index climbed 48.63 to 7,183.75 in
turnover of TDollars 64.16bn.
Financials drew interest after four major banks raised interest rates in
response to the central bank's tight grip on liquidity since July. ICBC was
up TDollars 2 to TDollars 105 and China Development rose TDollars 2 to
TDollars 153.
HONG KONG's Hang Seng index fell below 9,500 at the close, with investors
depressed by the outlook for interest rates and the state of the local
property market.
The index lost 28.75 at 9,492.49 in turnover that dwindled to HKDollars
2.24bn, the lightest since July 4, and compared with HKDollars 4.32bn on
Friday.
Cheung Kong declined 50 cents to HKDollars 37.10 and Sun Hung Kai Properties
dipped 75 cents to HKDollars 56.75.
SINGAPORE saw sustained buying by foreign funds which took the Straits Times
Industrial index 15.89 higher to 2,348.52.
SYDNEY was mixed in very low volume, with the Labour Day holiday in New
South Wales keeping most large investors away. The All Ordinaries index
closed 2.3 firmer at 2,030.9.
Trading activity was dominated by News Corp, 9 cents lower at ADollars 8.47
following its announcement of an issue of limited voting preference shares.
The resources sector was aided late in the session by a strong performance
from the oil and gas sector as shares in Woodside Petroleum moved ahead 20
cents to ADollars 5.20 after it reported a hydrocarbon find in the Dampier
sub-basin, offshore western Australia.
WELLINGTON saw late demand for Telecom after an otherwise quiet day. The
NZSE-40 Capital index rose 10.93 to 2,077.23 as Telecom picked up 8 cents to
NZDollars 5.35.
KUALA LUMPUR finished lower after a volatile session which saw prices moving
in a wide range. The composite index closed 2.41 off at the day's low of
1,127.35, down from a high of 1,136.63.
MANILA edged higher on bargain hunting among issues newly included in the
index, and other second liners.
The composite index firmed 7.66 to 2,915.9 as volume increased to 2.7bn
shares.
BOMBAY returned to positive territory on sustained speculative buying after
last week's downturn, which was triggered by the outbreak of plague. The
30-share BSE index closed 58.46 or 1.6 per cent ahead at 4,339.46. The
market lost 175 points last week following the Surat plague, which had
claimed 50 lives.

FT  04 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (South Africa): Golds face testing week
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Selected industrials attracted interest in otherwise lacklustre Johannesburg
trading, with gold shares expected to face a testing week if bullion fails
to rally.
The overall index was 4 softer at 5,672, industrials added 11 at 6,290 and
golds receded 17 to 2,425.
De Beers moved ahead 75 cents to R102.50 as its climb continued, but Anglos
finished unchanged at R240 and Gencor dipped 10 cents to R14.65.
Barlows was R1.60 better at R30.35 after announcing plans for a Dollars 75m
bond issue to international investors and saying that it expected strong
full-year earnings growth.
Group Five and Group Five Holdings reversed Friday's steady gains,
relinquishing 20 cents and 15 cents at R4.80 and R4.60 respectively.

FT  04 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): French stocks in focus move
against the trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The NAPM index of manufacturing activity in the US gave European bond
markets an uncomfortable afternoon, confirming an established mood of
concern, some pessimism and a general lack of appetite for investment in
most equity markets, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was already concerned with the lack of scope for further interest rate
reductions, and with worries such as the future of the politicians Messrs
Longuet and Leotard, said Mr Michael Woodcock, French market analyst at
Nikko Europe, as the CAC 40 index fell a further 26.42 to a new 1994 low of
1,852.83.
However, the stocks of the day mostly ran against the trend. In this
category, Credit Lyonnais certificates delivered a rebound of FFr42 or 10.8
per cent to FFr430 after a high of FFr462, and a meeting last Friday between
the chairman of the bank, Mr Jean Peyrelevade, and market analysts. The
latter said Mr Peyrelevade had been more positive about promised state
support.
Thomson-CSF, which owns 19 per cent of Credit Lyonnais, rose FFr8 or 5.8 per
cent to FFr147. At the same time, Chargeurs, the textiles group and former
CAC 40 constituent which owns 17.5 per cent of BSkyB, shot up FFr77 or 6.3
per cent to FFr1,297 on the latter's flotation plans.
On the downside, LVMH continued its correction, losing FFr30 at FFr842 as
trading in its Au Bon Marche, Financiere Agache and Arnault et Associes
subsidiaries was suspended ahead of an announcement; and Pernod, with
results due after hours, dropped FFr12 to FFr291.
ZURICH's attention remained glued to the forthcoming battle between UBS and
Mr Martin Ebner's BK Bank, and the SMI index, also taking its lead from
lower bourses elsewhere, fell 34.9 or 1.4 per cent to 2,499.5.
UBS bearers declined SFr30 to SFr1,170 and the registered shares, which have
five times the voting power of the bearers, slipped SFr20 to SFr283. Late in
the day, the Zurich prosecutor's office said it would launch a preliminary
inquiry into the possibility of insider trading in UBS shares before the
bank announced its plans for a capital restructuring on Friday.
BK Vision, the investment company controlled by BK Bank, dipped SFr100 to
SFr1,300. Other so called BK shares, in which BK Vision has substantial
holdings, extended Friday's losses. Roche certificates gave up SFr155 to
SFr5,630 and Zurich Insurance was SFr37 lower at SFr1,150.
Swiss Re registered picked up SFr18 to SFr644 in continued response to its
decision to sell its direct insurance holdings.
Bearers in Elvia, suspended on Friday on the news that the group was being
sold to Germany's Allianz, rocketed SFr1,555 or 80.1 per cent to SFr3,475.
Allianz has committed itself to offering Elvia's minority shareholders a
maximum price of SFr3,915 per bearer share.
MILAN saw selling accelerate as the day progressed on the view that with the
budget proposals now published, and a largely positive string of six-month
corporate announcements now concluded, all the good news was now in the
market, and political clouds could soon be gathering.
The Comit index fell 12.03 or 1.8 per cent to 667.74 following last Friday's
1.6 per cent drop.
Fiat led the decline with a L189 fall to L6,480. James Capel, which upgraded
the stock after last week's substantially better than expected half-year
results, commented that in spite of the strong performance of the shares
this year - up by almost 40 per cent against the Comit index - the price
appeared to be well underpinned by fundamentals and could move ahead in the
short term as analysts raised their forecasts.
Banks continued to be hit by continuing gloom over their poor first-half
figures. Banco di Napoli fell L182 or 11.5 per cent to L1,498, further hurt
by speculation that it might be about to launch a capital increase. BCI lost
L156 at L3,730 and Ambrovento was L219 down at L4,166.
AMSTERDAM was lower on bond market weakness and London's performance and the
AEX index shed 3.49 to 398.78.
Scattered issues bucked the trend, however, with Royal Dutch Petroleum up 80
cents to Fl 188, helped by the firmer dollar.
KNP BT closed 80 cents down at Fl 51.20 and brokers expected it to come
under further pressure today following news after the market closed that a
proposed merger with Ivan Allen, of the US, was not going ahead.
MADRID's bond and equity markets did better than most, the general index for
the latter falling 2.77 to 294.69. Dealers said investors were very nervous
about trends in other bond markets, and concerned that the real time Ibex
equity index would break positively downwards through support at 3,125,
after which they thought it might fall to 3,000. As it was, the Ibex
bottomed at 3,121.41 before recovering to 3,149.08.
TEL AVIV surrendered 1.8 per cent on profit-taking but this meant little
after two days of gains, especially Sunday's 3 per cent advance following
the announcement of a partial lifting of the Arab boycott by six Gulf
countries. Turnover was low at Shk131m as the Mishtanim index finished 3.41
off at 189.71.
ISTANBUL fell 1.7 per cent on missing signatures from three government
ministers of Turkey's draft privatisation bill. The index dropped 451.86 to
26,373.67 after a gain of 4.1 per cent last week.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Trade deal lifts dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US dollar briefly climbed above the Y100 level in London trading
yesterday as the currency initially benefited from the weekend announcement
of a partial US-Japan trade deal, writes Philip Coggan.
However, the dollar's momentum was halted by the National Association of
Purchasing Managers' report, which showed the prices component at a six-year
high. This hit the US Treasury bond market, which has been one of the main
driving forces behind the dollar's weakness in recent months.
The dollar closed in London at Y99.82, almost Y1 higher than Friday's close
of Y98.97. Against the D-Mark, the US currency improved to DM1.5573, from
DM1.5515 on Friday. The weakness of the US Treasury bond market caused the
dollar to give up some of its gain in New York trading, which it finished at
Y99.55 and DM1.5540.
The pound was stronger against the D-Mark, helped by continuing uncertainty
about the electoral prospects of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition
partners, the FDP.
Sterling rose through DM2.4520, seen as a key resistance level by technical
analysts, to close at DM2.4574 in London, up more than a pfennig from
Friday's DM2.4468. But the pound only edged up against the dollar, ending at
Dollars 1.5780 from Friday's Dollars 1.5770.
The weekend announcement of a partial US-Japan trade deal relieved some of
the worries that had hypnotised the foreign exchange markets throughout much
of last week's trading.
The deal only covered the issues of government procurement, insurance and
glass, and not the much more important automobile sector.
Accordingly, the deal may have little impact on the US's trade deficit with
Japan. Furthermore, the US has said it will start to investigate Japan's
replacement car parts market under Section 301 of its trade law.
Some traders accordingly doubted whether the deal would be strengthened in
the long term. The dollar did rise sharply in the morning, briefly passing
the Y100 level, with the help of rumoured hedge fund buying.
But signs that the dollar may not get any permanent benefit from the deal
came in the afternoon when the US currency fell back on publication of the
NAPM report.
On top of the bad news on prices, a rise in the employment component of the
NAPM report strengthened expectations that the non-farm payroll figure, due
to be published on Friday, will be strong. That would increase pressure on
the US Federal Reserve to raise rates.
Although higher short-term rates are normally positive for a currency, that
factor is far outweighed by the negative impact stronger economic growth has
been having on the Treasury bond market. The key 30-year Treasury bond was
down half a point, yielding 7.86 per cent, in London trading yesterday.
Mr Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan in London, said: 'The
dollar/Treasury relationship may have weakened, but we doubt that it has
broken and we look for further bond market weakness to drag the dollar
lower.'
Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS, said that in spite
of the uplift from the trade deal, 'investors have got to overcome some
nervousness regarding the dollar's fundamentals'.
However, Mr Mike Norman, publisher of the Economic Contrarian Update in
Geneva, argues that 'we are in the process of seeing a major turn in the
dollar'. He believes this could be very important for world bond markets
since a dollar rise would quell inflationary fears in the US.
Most European currencies were stronger against the D-Mark which, according
to Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America, 'is going
to remain soft until the election is out of the way; at the moment, the
polls appear to suggest that Kohl could have some difficulty in forming a
new government'.
The lira managed a small gain against the D-Mark - finishing at L1,005 from
Friday's L1,006 - in spite of renewed fears about the prospects of Italian
Budget passage.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided cumulative help of
Pounds 818m to relieve an Pounds 800m shortage. The Bank's earlier forecasts
of the shortage had been Pounds 750m and Pounds 700m. Overnight rates moved
within a range of 7 per cent to 4 1/2 per cent.
Short sterling contracts fell in the wake of figures showing a sharp rise in
the annual rate of growth of M0, the narrow measure of the money supply.
Although some analysts argued that the figures were merely a statistical
blip, markets evidently felt that the pace of M0 growth, one of the Bank of
England's inflationary indicators, made a further rise in base rates more
likely.
At the close, the December short sterling contract was trading at 93.16,
indicating that markets expect a full percentage point increase in base
rates, from the current level of 5.75 per cent, before the end of the year.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bumper crop puts cotton prices
under pressure - This year's US harvest could be the biggest in nearly 60
years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE

<TEXT>
The US cotton harvest is moving into full swing in the US Mississippi delta
region this week, with farmers projected to bring in the largest crop in
nearly 60 years. Although traders and cotton merchants initially scoffed at
the US Department of Agriculture's forecast of a record-breaking harvest of
19m bales (480lb each), early harvest data show the estimate is on target.
'Our cotton is picking a little better than it looks, and I'm hearing the
same thing from folks in Louisiana and Arkansas,' says Mr Will McCarty,
Extension Cotton Specialist with Mississippi State University.
'The farmer that was expecting to get about 775lb per acre is getting 800.
What that means is the mid-South cotton crop could be a little bigger than
expected.'
Texas is the only state reporting disappointing yields in the early harvest
period. Its crop suffered from localised early-season drought. While some
traders still expect the USDA to reduce its crop estimate as the harvest
progresses, local agricultural agents say it appears gains in the delta
region will more than offset any shortfall in the Texas harvest.
Prices as high as 86 cents a pound during the the spring planting season
provided a strong incentive for farmers to seed more acres than usual to
cotton, says Mr Kevin Brinkley, an economist with the National Cotton
Council. Since then, as the reality of an extra-large crop has sunk in, the
market has dropped into a range of 65 to 75 cents a pound, and is now
feeling pressure from the harvest.
However, even with the world cotton production situation much improved over
last year, when China, India, and Pakistan all had crop shortfalls, the US
producer will still benefit from strong exports, Mr Brinkley says.
Last year, when world cotton production fell to 76m bales, the US exported
7m bales of raw cotton. This year, with world output projected to rise to
86m bales, US producers expect to export 7.3m bales.
US manufacturers are also getting better at exporting finished cotton. They
will ship the equivalent of 2m bales in finished textile products overseas
this year, compared with only 429,000 in 1984, according to National Cotton
Council statistics.
Mr James Steel, a commodities analyst with Refco in New York, notes that US
cotton consumption is also rising. 'Domestic demand is the highest it's been
since 1947,' he says. 'We're currently projecting domestic consumption at
11m bales, but it could go even higher.' He is also optimistic that as Japan
and Europe emerge from recession, cotton demand will increase in those
regions.
Over the longer term, Mr Steel sees world cotton demand rising as developing
countries like China and India succeed in boosting the real incomes of their
vast populations. 'China is consuming far more of its own cotton than ever
before, and while their own harvest is better than last year, they still
need to buy US cotton to mix to get the quality they need. The US is
expected to ship about 1m bales of cotton to China this year, down only
slightly from last year's 1.069m.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber pact members try to
break deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rubber producing and consuming countries yesterday began a second round of
talks on a new price-stabilising commodity pact to succeed the 1987
International Natural Rubber Agreement. The negotiations will centre on the
key issues of the price level and range for buffer stock operations.
Mr Peter Lai, chairman of the talks, has put forward new price proposals to
break the deadlock that prevented agreement on a new accord at the last
negotiating session in April. However, despite expressing cautious optimism
that a deal can be reached this time, the two sides have shown little sign
of shifting their positions.
Consumer countries, led by the US and European Union, have so far resisted
the demand by producers for an increase in the reference price for rubber.
This has remained basically unchanged since the first rubber pact was agreed
in 1979. The current reference price is 196.84 Malaysian/Singapore cents a
kilogram with a range of 15 to 20 per cent either way before buffer stock
operations come into play.
The present round of talks takes place against a backdrop of an unexpected
surge in rubber prices this summer which enabled the buffer stock manager to
sell most of the 222,000 tonnes accumulated over four years of depressed
prices.
The reasons for the sharp rise in prices include heavy rains in the three
main exporting countries - Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia - which
restricted tapping, increased imports by China in particular, stockbuilding
in industrialised countries where economic recovery is under way and
purchases by investment funds.
Some analysts believe this could signal a fundamental shift in the balance
of world supply and demand, from abundance and low prices to scarcity and
generally higher prices. This would underpin the producers' case for a
higher reference price.
The 1987 accord, the only international commodity pact remaining with
price-stabilising provisions, is due to expire on December 28 but can be
extended for a further year if no agreement is reached this time.
The two-week meeting, under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development, is being attended by 32 countries, accounting in 1993
for 97 per cent of world exports and 72 per cent of world imports. The main
consumers, apart from the US and EU, are Japan and China.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hydro seeks to update Russia's
Bratsk smelter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Norway's Hydro Aluminium is seeking to rehabilitate Russia's Bratsk
aluminium smelter, the biggest in the world, to improve efficiency and
environmental standards, according to a company official, reports Reuters
from Moscow.
A delegation from Hydro Aluminium, part of the Norsk Hydro group, visited
Bratsk last month to discuss the project. 'It was a very positive meeting,'
said Mr Odd Efjestad, senior vice-president in charge of aluminium at
Hydro's Moscow office. Negotiations were well advanced, but no contract had
been signed yet, he added.
Officials at the central Siberian smelter, where environmental groups have
voiced concern over pollution, were not immediately available for comment.
The Kommersant Daily newspaper reported that officials at the Bratsk plant,
which has capacity to produce up to 820,000 tonnes of aluminium a year, were
studying reconstruction and modernisation proposals submitted by virtually
every leading aluminium company in the world.
It said the Russian officials were impressed with the Norwegian technology,
but gave few details.
Mr Efjestad said that Hydro Aluminium wanted to improve existing facilities
at the Bratsk smelter 'in a way that they would reach almost the same
results, in terms of both efficiency and the environment, as if they were
rebuilding with expensive pre-baked technology'.
The Bratsk smelter is equipped with Soderberg type pots. The more expensive
pre-baked technology has come to dominate in the western aluminium industry.
'In Bratsk, we are just modernising the Soderberg cells. With our
technology, we will achieve almost the same effect for almost the same
cost,' Mr Efjestad said.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Logistical snags are tying up
aluminium stocks, says report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Logistical snags are tying up aluminium warehouse stocks and contributing to
a supply tightness that could boost ingot prices above Dollars 1 a pound
(Dollars 2,204 a tonne) by mid-1995, according to industry analyst Stewart
Spector, reports Reuters from New York.
In the latest issue of the Spector Report, he also said the shortage could
prompt Western producers to restart idled capacity by mid-1995 to keep
prices from rising too quickly.
'While a large statistical ingot surplus does exist, it's not all available
for immediate delivery to markets where demand is rising rapidly. . . It is
possible, in our opinion, that by the end of 1995 Western smelters could be
operating at nearly 100 per cent capacity.'
Spector said that London Metal Exchange warehouses in Rotterdam, with 1.1m
tonnes of aluminium, are the principal and most convenient location for
shipping ingot to the world market. Total LME warehouse stocks now stand at
2.31m tonnes, down 13 per cent from the mid-June record.
The report suggested that logistical problems at Rotterdam could limit
weekly aluminium shipments to about 30,000 to 40,000 tonnes in the next
several months, short of the optimum 60,000 tonnes.
'At that rate, it could take well into 1995 to empty Rotterdam's
warehouses,' Spector said.
The result, he said, was likely to be a further jump in aluminium prices to
between 80 and 85 US cents a pound by the end of 1994 and to Dollars 1.20 to
Dollars 1.30 by the end of the first quarter or early in the second quarter
of 1995. The current price is 72 cents a pound.
Spector also estimated that western aluminium shipments this year would rise
10 per cent, while production would slip 4.6 per cent to 14.4m tonnes.
Stocks were projected to fall by 855,000 tonnes.
For 1995, Spector forecast that shipments would rise 6.5 per cent, with
production likely to grow 3.6 per cent to 14.9m tonnes.
Meanwhile, a worldwide shortage of alumina (aluminium oxide) was likely to
keep Russian primary aluminium production at or below current levels for the
next few years, the report said, while the state of disrepair at Russian
smelters would also weigh on output levels.
'The CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) ingot that started flowing
into the West in 1990 and trashed ingot prices could soon fade away as an
industry concern,' it suggested. 'In 1995, the Western aluminium industry
may finally get its share of the peace dividend.'
Spector predicted that, if western primary producers returned to full
capacity in the middle of next year and if Chinese and eastern European
alumina imports remained at current levels, the market might see an annual
alumina shortfall of 2m tonnes in 1996 and 1997.
That could result in a cut in Russian alumina imports and reduced
production, he said.
He forecast Russian production at 2.66m tonnes this year, off 5.6 per cent
from 1993, with a further decline to 2.58m tonnes possible next year.

London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures lost steam and closed lower in thin
volume following arbitrage selling and conflicting reports about the
Brazilian weather situation, dealers said. COCOA prices also slipped as
dealers awaited news regarding the size of the Ivory Coast's crop.
At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices staged an impressive rally on
short-covering and fresh buying in the afternoon to break back above Dollars
2,480 a tonne for three months delivery. The ALUMINIUM market sucked in
speculative buying as the three months price pushed back above Dollars 1,620
a tonne.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway to step up Statfjord oil
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, expects to increase recovery from
the prolific North Sea Statfjord field by 220m barrels of oil worth an
estimated NKr22bn (Pounds 2.05m) at current prices.
'We are pushing the recovery from the Statfjord field to the limits,' Ms
Wenche Skorge, a Statoil spokesperson, said yesterday.
The field's recoverable reserves are to be upgraded to 3.89bn barrels from
3.69bn, marking the fourth upgrade since production of crude oil came
onstream in 1979 and lifting the recovery factor to 62 per cent against an
average 40 per cent from other Norwegian North Sea fields.
By the end of this year about 3bn barrels of these reserves will have been
produced but daily average production this year has reached 650,000 barrels,
exceeding the 1993 production plan for 600,000 barrels.
Statoil attributes the potential to increase recovery from the field to the
development of expertise in reservoir engineering, highly-deviated well
drilling and extended reach-horizontal well drilling - so called 'designer
wells' - enabling the tapping of oil from the Brent and Statfjord reservoirs
that would not be possible with conventional technology.
For the Statfjord reservoir a new drainage strategy - in which water will be
injected into the gas-filled reservoir so as to drive residual oil towards
production wells - is expected to boost production by an estimated 88m
barrels and the recovery factor by 80 per cent from this formation.
An improved and growing understanding of the Upper and Lower Brent
reservoirs is expected to sustain a high rate of recovery over a longer
period, potentially yielding 132m barrels more of oil from these structures.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries retreat on rate rise fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds retreated yesterday on the release of economic data which
reinforced expectations of an imminent increase in short-term interest
rates.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/16 lower
at 95 29/32 , with the yield rising to 7.85 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was down  1/8 at 99, to yield 6.653 per cent.
Early on, prices improved as the dollar gained ground against other leading
currencies. The move reflected partial agreement reached by US and Japanese
negotiators at the weekend in negotiations over an array of trade issues.
However, bonds quickly surrendered their gains on the release of the monthly
survey conducted by the National Association of Purchasing Management. The
results showed continued strength in the manufacturing sector and further
pressure on prices.
The NAPM's overall index of business activity climbed to 58.2 per cent in
September, from 56.2 per cent the previous month. The price component of the
survey reached a six-year high of 77.1 per cent, up from 74.5 per cent.
The inflation-sensitive long end of the maturity range was most unsettled by
the news, with the yield on the 30-year issue climbing a little closer to
the 8.00 per cent level. But the short end was also down, as the data
provided a little more evidence which might support a move by the Federal
Reserve to put up short-term rates for the sixth time this year.
Many traders are expecting the Fed to act before the end of the month, as it
becomes more apparent that the five policy tightenings so far have failed to
slow the economy.
The timing of the central bank's next move could be determined by the
strength of this Friday's report on August employment conditions.
European government bonds followed US Treasuries lower on the NAPM data, and
sentiment was jittery amid continued speculation over a near-term increase
in US interest rates.
'Fears of imminent Fed tightening are likely to be a depressing factor for
European markets all week,' said Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at
Yamaichi International.
With Germany closed for a national holiday, turnover was relatively thin and
price movements were mainly futures-led. Hopes of fresh cash allocations at
the start of the fourth quarter were dashed by the renewed market weakness.
UK gilts were particularly badly hit, closing nearly a point lower on the
day. After briefly breaching technical resistance at 100 and rising to 100
3/16 , the December long gilt futures contract on Liffe fell by 29/32 to 98
27/32 .
The market began to weaken in the morning on news of a stronger than
expected rise in M0 money supply growth, raising fears that inflationary
pressures could prompt another increase in base rates. M0 posted a
seasonally adjusted year-on-year rise of 7.1 per cent in September, compared
with market forecasts of a 6.3 per cent rise.
The news eclipsed data from the Nationwide Building Society showing a 2.9
per cent decline in UK house prices in September from August.
The sharp price decline, especially among longer-dated gilts, caused the UK
yield spread over German bonds to widen markedly to 151 basis points from
137 on Friday.
Although Germany was closed, the bund future on Liffe fell  1/2 point to
88.30 in the wake of the US numbers. The October 16 federal elections were
also weighing on the market.
While most market participants are betting on a re-election of the governing
centre-right coalition, there is widespread talk of a grand coalition
including the opposition Social Democrats.
However, the market does not seem to be discounting a change in government.
Consequently, 'if polls continue to show a close outcome in coming weeks,
the risk remains for somewhat higher bond yields near-term', warn analysts
at Salomon Brothers.
Italian bonds fell nearly a point, depressed by the NAPM numbers and fears
that Italy's budget could face a struggle through parliament. The December
BTP future on Liffe fell by 0.87 to 98.90.

FT  04 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Revival of activity in Latin
American eurobond issuance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Latin American eurobond market saw a revival of activity in the third
quarter of this year, following two successive quarters of decline.
It was lifted by greater political and economic stability in the region and
a better tone in the US Treasury market.
According to a report by West Merchant Bank, the London subsidiary of
Germany's Westdeutsche Landesbank, Dollars 3.4bn worth of new offerings were
launched during the third quarter of 1994, compared with Dollars 2.0bn in
the second quarter.
This is still less than the Dollars 6.4bn worth of bonds offered in the
first three months of the year and the Dollars 9.2bn launched in the final
three months of 1993. Nevertheless, it is a significant improvement on the
second quarter of the year, which saw many borrowers withdraw from the
market.
Mr Peter West, economic adviser at West Merchant Bank, said in the report:
'The third-quarter upturn suggests that the market is slowly recovering from
the negative shock caused earlier in the year by higher US interest rates,
the collapse in the secondary debt market, and adverse political and
financial developments in countries like Mexico and Venezuela.'
However, further progress will depend to a great extent on the state of the
US government bond market.
The recovery in the third quarter takes total Latin American offerings for
the year to Dollars 11.9bn, down 31 per cent on the same period in 1993 but
greater than the Dollars 10.2bn raised during the whole of 1992.
Brazil and Mexico accounted for a large part of the resurgence in activity.
The success of the Real Plan in controlling inflation and the prospect of
victory in today's presidential elections for Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso,
the former finance minister and the plan's architect, has boosted investor
confidence in Brazil.
Sentiment in Mexico, which has been battered by political unrest, found
support in the recent election victory of Mr Ernesto Zedillo. The signing
last month of the 'pacto', the agreement between business, labour and the
government under which prices, wages and exchange rate policies are set,
will provide further support.
However, the assassination last week of an important figure in the ruling
PRI party is likely to be a significant blow to confidence.
Brazil launched eight offerings in the third quarter with a total value of
Dollars 537m, compared with only two offerings in the second quarter worth
Dollars 81m.
'Brazilian issuers have to some extent improved their ability to access
international capital markets,' said Ms Rebecca Clarke, research manager at
West Merchant Bank. 'Now the elections are over, we are likely to see more
new issuance from Brazil.'
Activity was greatest in September, when issuance reached its highest level
since February. There was a rush of large offerings from Mexico and
Argentina, including two deals from Cemex, Mexico's largest cement producer.
The quarter was also notable for a rise in the number of countries tapping
the market. Colombia, Chile and Trinidad and Tobago, all absent in the
second quarter, returned to the market, to join Argentina, Brazil, Peru and
Mexico.

FT  04 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: US mutual funds back
Investcorp acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investcorp, the international investment bank, said it had completed the
acquisition of Ebel SA, a leading Swiss manufacturer of luxury watches, in a
deal which uses a financing technique never used before in Europe.
The deal relies on a form of financing, becoming increasingly common in the
US market, under which mutual fund companies establish separate funds
specifically to invest in senior floating-rate notes and longer-term loan
maturities.
In the Ebel deal, Investcorp will acquire a majority stake in Ebel, with the
company's management buying remaining shares through a SFr130m
multi-currency facility arranged by Bankers Trust.
This consists of a SFr80m three-year revolving credit facility and a term
loan in two tranches.
The first tranche is a SFr48m five-year amortising bullet loan with an
average life of 3 1/2 years; the second tranche of the loan is for SFr32m,
does not begin amortising until the sixth year and funds are provided by
mutual funds managed by Merrill Lynch and Van-Kampen Merritt.
Because Ebel, which has extensive US sales, has dollar-based cashflow, the
mutual funds can rely on receiving their interest and principal repayments
in their home currency.
'We have structured the term loan to tailor the maturity profile to the
needs of the investors and the company,' said Mr Paul Soldatos, a member of
Investcorp's management committee.

FT  04 OCT 94 / International Bonds: Japan Development Bank launches Dollars
500m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A small number of eurobond issues was launched into difficult market
conditions yesterday, with sharp falls in US and European government bond
prices.
Attention today turns to the World Bank's DM2bn global offering of five-year
fixed-rate bonds, which will be launched today and priced tomorrow, said
joint lead manager Morgan Stanley.
In the US dollar sector, the Japan Development Bank launched Dollars 500m of
five-year bonds, priced to yield 22 basis points over US Treasuries.
Demand for the offering came from institutional investors in Japan and
continental Europe, who were attracted by the relatively wide spread and
high coupon, said joint lead manager IBJ. The proceeds were swapped into
yen.
One syndicate manager described the pricing and size of the deal as
'generally well-conceived', although another said it seemed to have received
a mixed response.
A syndicate official at IBJ said: 'The only problem has been the weakness in
the US Treasury market. Some investors are postponing their purchases until
they reach the point where they feel that the market has gone too low.'
The Kingdom of Sweden launched a Dollars 300m issue of fixed-rate two-year
bonds, priced to yield 15 basis points over US Treasuries.
Joint lead manager Morgan Stanley said the deal met good demand, mostly in
the European retail sector. The funds are believed to have been swapped into
floating-rate dollars. One syndicate manager said he thought the deal was
priced tightly, but added: 'It was an opportunity that Morgan Stanley saw on
the day and pounced on.'
The Council of Europe Resettlement Fund launched its first sterling deal
since 1984, Pounds 100m of two-year fixed-rate bonds priced to yield 17
basis points over gilts. The issue, which found demand among financial
institutions in the UK and retail investors in Luxembourg and Switzerland,
offered a wide yield spread against other European markets, said lead
manager SG Warburg.

FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: NRMA flotation hits roadblock -
Demutualisation plan faces a challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One might imagine that, in exchange for a 'free' handout of shares worth
anything from ADollars 500 (Dollars 367) to ADollars 2,000, customers would
be fairly sanguine about their insurance company's legal structure.
But NRMA, the large Australian personal lines insurer which wants to move to
shareholder-owned status via a ADollars 2.2bn-plus stock market flotation
before the end of the year, is running into surprising roadblocks as it
pursues the demutualisation path.
This week, two dissident directors who are opposed to the flotation scheme
will mount a legal challenge, arguing that NRMA's prospectus is misleading
and deceptive. Already, complaints from some NRMA members to the Trade
Practices Commission, the Australian watchdog, have forced the insurer to
publish corrective advertisements over sale details.
More fundamentally, such stirrings raise doubts about the degree of support
which the insurer will be able to secure from members when they finally vote
on the issue on October 19. If demutualisation is successful, NRMA would
become Australia's largest quoted insurance company, but it needs 75 per
cent of members voting in favour before it can proceed.
One opinion poll, published over the weekend, suggested that only 56 per
cent of a 600 member-sample was supportive, while 21 per cent was opposed.
The remaining 23 per cent was undecided.
Stung by these results, NRMA retorted that its own research indicated that
more than 80 per cent of members would support the scheme. It also noted
that the same unfavourable survey showed an 81 per cent 'yes' vote among
members who had already returned polling forms.
Nevertheless, while NRMA officials publicly profess a 'quiet confidence'
about the outcome, a heavy lobbying and publicity campaign speaks volumes
for the inherent uncertainty.
This unexpected tussle has two causes. The first derives from the company's
history, which means that it is much more than just an insurance operation.
Secondly, the rationale behind the flotation has not been particularly well
articulated, and members could justifiably claim to be confused.
NRMA was formed as a motoring club in 1920, mainly to lobby for better roads
(its acronym derives from its original name, the National Roads &amp; Motorists
Association). Within a few years, it had begun to provide emergency
breakdown services. In 1925, it added an insurance arm.
Over the next five decades, the organisation entered the life and home
contents insurance markets, but remained focused on its New South Wales
base. Geographical expansion only entered its strategy this year, when it
moved into Victoria.
Today, NRMA's business splits into two parts. On the one hand, there are the
insurance operations, which are still dominated by the motor business. Car
policies accounted for 51 per cent of NRMA's ADollars 1.1bn premium income
last year, with compulsory third-party policies accounting for 15 per cent.
This makes NRMA Australia's largest motor insurer, with more than 1.6m
policies in force.
On the other, there is the road service division, which ranges from a
24-hour helpline for car breakdowns to travel information and a hotel
booking facility. It is broadly similar to the RAC and Automobile
Association in the UK, although Australia's geography makes membership a
more essential precaution.
To access these services, a motorist must become an NRMA member and pay a
one-off joining fee of ADollars 36 plus an annual subscription of the same
amount. There are currently more than 1.8 members, about 70 per cent of whom
also hold NRMA insurance policies. These people will determine the company's
future.
The prospectus, sent out to members, is remarkably bland about the reasons
for the float: it says simply that NRMA wants to demutualise 'to enable its
financial success to be shared with its members'.
Since then, directors and NRMA officials have been more ingenuous, stating
that the flotation is vital to future growth. They point out that mutual
insurers have a limited ability to raise new capital quickly. A prudent
mutual, therefore, will tend to store funds for unexpected needs.
By floating, and having access to the stock market as a capital source, NRMA
will be able to use its funds more efficiently. There will be less need to
hoard funds, at the same time, it will be able to generate new capital if it
wants to expand. Directors acknowledge that more diversity in insured risks
would be desirable.
In addition, NRMA has noted that it has 'significant' tax credits which it
cannot utilise at present. As a listed company, it could use these in
payment of franked dividends. Finally, directors have claimed that stock
market status would encourage a more 'market-driven' focus within the group.
Worry among members centres on this last point, one particular fear being
that efforts to pursue efficiencies on the insurance side will undermine
services on the motoring side.
At present, NRMA barely breaks even on motor services. According to the
rather scant financial information contained in the prospectus, motor
services have incurred annual losses ranging between ADollars 6m and
ADollars 10m over the past four years. This has been covered by 'member
services investment income' in the ADollars 11m to ADollars 13m range.
The insurance division has been more rewarding, with underwriting losses
consistently outweighed by investment income. Pre-tax profits on this side -
before unrealised investment gains or losses - have run out at ADollars 44m,
ADollars 192m, and ADollars 125m over the past three years. Results in the
first year, moreover, were depressed by catastrophe claims. About ADollars
100m is estimated for the year to end-June 1994 with ADollars 141m forecast
for the current year.
But on this score, too, opponents of demutualisation fear that shareholders'
demand for profits will mean higher premiums. In particular, they claim that
NRMA is planning to discontinue insurance rebates for members.
The company, not surprisingly, has said that these fears are exaggerated.
According to Mr Ray Willing, chief executive, NRMA will continue to provide
'a world-leading road service and competitive insurance premiums'. The
organisation claims that alternative means of distributing excess capital to
members - through insurance rebates, say, or low membership fees - are
either inefficient or less equitable.
As for worries that a listed NRMA could be taken over, it points out that
there is a 5 per cent cap on any single shareholding until 2000, and some
protections under federal legislation thereafter.
NRMA has even gone so far as to claim that the flotation - with its
associated share handout - is 'one of the greatest acts of corporate
generosity' seen in Australia.
Somehow, with two weeks to go to the crucial vote, all members have yet to
be convinced.

FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Nippon Mortgage Corporation
files for liquidation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nippon Mortgage Corporation, a medium-sized non-bank financial institution
burdened with substantial non-performing loans, yesterday filed for
liquidation.
An extraordinary meeting of shareholders approved the action, first
signalled by the company's directors in July.
At March 31, Nippon Mortgage had liabilities of Y518.4bn (Dollars 5.24bn)
and assets of just Y454.7bn. Principal creditors - which include Sumitomo
Trust and Banking Corporation - considered this gap too large to be plugged
by fresh injections of capital.
The folding of Nippon Mortgage is the third largest corporate collapse in
Japan since the second world war.
The company was established in 1982 by Sumitomo Trust and other companies to
specialise in property-related lending.
In 1991, at the height of the 'bubble economy', a period of rapid asset
price inflation, Nippon Mortgage had a loan book with a paper worth of
Y540.5bn. By the start of this year, however, an estimated 97 per cent of
its total loans had become non-performing following the bursting of the
bubble.
Fujisawa Pharmaceutical, a leading Japanese drugs manufacturer, has revised
upwards its non-consolidated earnings forecast for the first half and the
full year to March 1995 due to cost-cutting efforts and a rise in demand for
its antibiotics, writes Emiko Terazono.
The company, which initially expected a 3 per cent fall in interim sales to
Y113bn and a 23 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y9bn, now sees the
pre-tax figure rising 3.1 per cent to Y12bn on a 1.3 per cent increase in
sales to Y118bn for the six months to September.
The company also attributed the rise in sales to buying by hospitals and
physicians who had waited for a cut in national health insurance drug prices
last April to purchase their drug supplies.
However, the company said the move by SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American
pharmaceuticals group to which Fujisawa provided its sales channel, to set
up its own distribution company next January would still depress annual
sales. The impact of the cut in the NHI official drug prices will also
affect earnings.
For the full year, Fujisawa now expects unconsolidated pre-tax earnings to
rise 5.3 per cent to Y21bn on a 1.2 per cent fall in sales to Y232bn, and a
40 per cent decline in after-tax profits to Y6bn.

Hungary is to privatise Zsolnay Porcelangyar, its largest manufacturer of
high-quality porcelain.
The state would sell an 84 per cent stake in the company through a one-round
tender which would close on November 28, according to AV RT, the state
holding company.
Because Zsolnay is one of Hungary's oldest and best-known companies, the
state plans to keep a golden share with some veto rights, according to
Japan's Daiwa MKB which is advising AV RT.
The 84 per cent stake has a nominal value of Ft463.6m (Dollars 4.29m) which
under Hungarian privatisation regulations is the minimum price acceptable.
AV RT said it aimed to find a partner which would keep the Zsolnay name and
maintain employment at its factory in Pecs, southern Hungary. Zsolnay, which
employs 1,100, had turnover of Ft950m in 1993 and is forecasting Ft1bn this
year.
Hand-painted porcelain, which the company has been producing for 150 years,
accounts for about 30 per cent of output. It also manufactures mass-produced
household crockery and porcelain high-voltage insulators, in which it has a
local market share of 80 per cent.
It has launched a marketing drive to lift exports to 40 per cent of
production, from the present level of between 20 per cent and 25 per cent.

<TEXT>
Arnault and Associates, part of Mr Bernard Arnault's French luxury goods and
retailing empire, yesterday took a further step in the rationalisation of
the group's complex structure, announcing a share exchange for investors in
Financiere Agache and Au Bon Marche, both members of the group.
Under the terms of the offer, Arnault and Associates has offered minority
shareholders of Financiere Agache one share in LVMH and one share in Dior,
the fashion group.
Separately, Financiere Agache is proposing that Au Bon Marche shareholders
exchange four of their shares for five Dior shares and two LVMH shares.
Both Financiere Agache and Dior are part of the LVMH empire, which spans
luggage, Cognac and champagne. Arnault and Associates, a subsidiary of LVMH,
is one of the companies through which Mr Arnault controls the group.
Mr Arnault said the aim of the exchange was to simplify the legal structures
of the group, while giving minority shareholders of Financiere Agache and Au
Bon Marche direct access to LVMH and Dior, which are both listed on the
Paris bourse.
He said the offer would be submitted to the market authorities for approval
by Lazard Freres, Cie and Credit Lyonnais.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Motorola, the US electronics and communications manufacturer, is expected
today to announce a significant initiative to enter the personal computer,
computer workstation and computer server markets.
Based on the PowerPC microprocessor chip jointly developed with IBM and
Apple Computer, the new Motorola computer products will include desktop
workstations, used primarily in scientific and engineering applications, as
well as servers which are used to control networks of PCs.
Motorola, which has had very limited success in the computer market, will
manufacture the computers for resale by other companies.
Motorola is also expected to manufacture PowerPC motherboards, the main
circuit boards for PCs. The company said it expected to ship between 250,000
and 300,000 computers and circuit boards next year.
These markets are led by Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and Digital
Equipment in workstations, and Compaq Computer in the server market.
Motorola will compete directly with IBM, its partner in PowerPC technology
development.
Motorola's revenues this year are expected to be about Dollars 22bn, up
about 30 per cent over last year. However, computers are expected to account
for only about 2 per cent of this.

Asarco, one of the largest integrated copper producers in the US, is taking
a Dollars 30.7m after-tax charge to third-quarter earnings to pay for
environmental clean-ups.
The charge, equal to Dollars 45.5m on a pre-tax basis, largely results from
a settlement between Asarco and the City of Tacoma, Washington, and
surrounding communities over the clean-up of a smelter site.

FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Momentum gathers for CGS as
Genesis reaps rewards - The troubled computer services group has forged a
multinational structure in order to survive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cap Gemini Sogeti, the French-based contender in the international computer
services industry, has taken a beating during the past few years.
Losses of FFr430m (Dollars 81.2m) last year raised questions about its
ability to respond to the increased competition and recession in the sector,
and the efficacy of its ambitious restructuring programme - grandly dubbed
Genesis.
The message from the company's smart Parisian headquarters, however, is that
the worst is over. Two years after the birth of Genesis, CGS believes its
aim of forging a coherent multinational structure from a disparate range of
operations is entering its final stages and the benefits are emerging where
they matter - on the bottom line.
'The momentum is gathering,' says Mr Geoff Unwin, chief operating officer.
After announcing a slight narrowing in first-half losses late last month, to
FFr115m from FFr197m, he predicts a return to profit in 1995. But, as Mr
Unwin concedes,there is still much to be done.
The end of recession in many markets, apart from southern Europe, has helped
revive demand and taken a little of the sting from price competition which
followed the expansion into the sector of industry hardware producers, such
as International Business Machines. 'The hardware producers came in with
crazy prices,' says Mr Unwin. 'We are now seeing signs of sanity on the
pricing front.'
With the introduction of new service offerings, such as information systems
management, the improved economic environment enabled the company to reverse
the trend of declining revenues in the second quarter. Sales have continued
to rise in the second half, while order books at the end of June were up by
about 12 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year.
More significant, claims the company, are the tangible benefits of the
Genesis programme. The restructuring was launched in 1992 with the aim of
welding a series of acquisitions, such as Hoskyns of the UK and Programator
of Sweden.
It has involved the division of the company into geographical and sectoral
centres with the aim of re-using products and services across its markets.
France, for example, has become the centre for telecommunications services,
while the US is the base for energy and oil-related systems.
The process has been expensive and difficult. Mr Unwin estimates that
FFr600m has been invested in the programme, about one-quarter of the
expenses relating to payments to the company's Gemini consulting arm, the
architect of the restructuring plan. The balance has gone largely to
training and communications charges.
The result of the upheaval, says CGS, is that the company can now offer
clients a broader range of services, more quickly.
'In the first half, we derived about 10 per cent of revenues from
transferring expertise and know-how from one country to another,' says Mr
Unwin.
He cites as an example the award of a telecoms contract in Hungary, won by a
Danish team using technology from the company's French operation.
For Mr Unwin, the company had little choice in its decision to launch the
ambitious programme. Medium-sized, country-based computer services groups
will find it hard to survive, he argues, in an industry where delivery times
and the ability to re-use programmes have become the main priority. 'Hoskyns
(Mr Unwin's previous company) was doing well, but we would be beaten out of
contracts from big companies which could import know-how.'
Unlike Hoskyns, CGS has enjoyed the protection of a solid shareholder base
during the upheaval. Mr Serge Kampf, founder of the group, and Daimler-Benz
of Germany, which holds 34 per cent of CGS, have provided a valuable
umbrella. 'We could not have undergone such change without them. We might
have been gobbled up,' says Mr Unwin.
The future of the company's shareholding structure is, however, a source of
uncertainty. Daimler-Benz has an option to take control of CGS from February
next year through the exercise of its convertible bond holdings.
The German group has expressed an interest in a stronger management role in
CGS, but most industry observers believe it is more concerned to find an
additional partner to strengthen its French associate's operations.
Such a partner could come from the telecoms sector. 'Large telecoms
operators are looking increasingly at what happens at the end of their
networks, for both business clients and consumers,' says Mr Unwin. 'They all
have, or are seeking, a presence in this industry.'
France Telecom, the state-owned operator, is one potential candidate. But
talks have yet to yield results. Like other possible partners and Cap
Gemini's existing smaller shareholders, it is likely to need more convincing
of the rewards of life after Genesis.

FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Mexico tightens rules for
financial sector after alleged fraud
</HEADLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico is drawing up tighter regulations for the financial sector following
reports of alleged fraud at the Union and Cremi banks, and at the Havre
financial group.
Mr Guillermo Ortiz, deputy finance minister, said that the new regulations
would require external auditors and the National Banking Commission to
investigate activities of financial institutions in more detail.
They would also make it easier for private agents to evaluate the quality of
a bank's assets by requiring financial groups to disclose more information.
The regulations are likely to be drawn up in time to be considered by the
incoming government of Mr Ernesto Zedillo, which takes office on December 1.
The new rules are aimed at bringing regulations in line with practices in
the industrialised world.
They are also intended to avoid a repetition of events at Havre - where
company executives allegedly set up fake companies that received
government-subsidied loans - and at Cremi and Union, where the chief
executive is said to have illegally lent up to Dollars 700m to companies he
controls.
According to Mr Ortiz, the National Banking Commission mainly analyses the
accounts of financial institutions without looking too closely at the
financial risks that institution is exposed to.
In future, the commission will examine more closely financial risks inherent
in a bank's lending or trading practices.
Mr Ortiz said that 'the financial authority is considering the emission of
norms that will oblige banks to measure interest rate, exchange rate and
inflation risk they are exposed to, and comply as a result with the
necessary levels of capital.'
The role of the external auditor is also expected to change. According to Mr
Ortiz, the external auditor may have to analyse in depth a sample of
credits, to verify information given by the banks.
Mr Ortiz urged that the auditor 'stop making just simple revisions of
accounts and help make clear to the investor the relevant information of
each institution'.
Directors will be encouraged to check more thoroughly that their institution
is complying with the law, and is assessing risks appropriately.
The government believes financial markets should become more important in
the evaluation of banks and their assets.
This should be helped by future regulations that will require similar
information disclosure in Mexico to that demanded by the US under GAAP
accounting rules.

CSA, the Czech national airline, cut its loss to Kcs281m (Dollars 24.4m) in
the first seven months of this year from a Kcs708m deficit in the same
period of 1993, Reuter reports from Prague.
In August, CSA reported a first-half loss of Kcs273m, of the year, against a
Kcs620m loss for the same period in 1993.
The Czech government is talking with several airlines about selling a 19.1

FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Baxter sells diagnostics side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baxter International, the Illinois-based hospital supplies group which
plunged into losses last year after a Dollars 925m restructuring, has agreed
to the sale of its diagnostics business for Dollars 448m.
The business had been put up for sale last November as part of a move by
Baxter to reduce borrowings and concentrate its investment in biotechnology
and renal therapy, and to develop its non-US operations.
The company said it had reached agreement to sell the business to Bain
Capital, a Boston-based buy-out firm. Some Dollars 40m of the consideration
will be in the form of preferred stock, with the remainder in cash and
accounts receivable retained by Baxter.
Baxter said that the sale would further reduce its debt levels, and that its
ratio of debt to total capital would be 'in the low 40 per cent range' by
the end of this year, compared with 50 per cent at the end of 1993.
The company's shares closed down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 28 in New York.
They have recovered almost Dollars 8 from the trough they hit a year ago,
when Baxter was rocked by a temporary US government ban on accepting bids
from the company, as well as an admission by Baxter that it had broken US
law by co-operating with an Arab boycott of Israel.

A British investment company jointly owned by Union Bank of Switzerland and

from privately-owned companies in Sweden's Stena group for about Dollars
120m.
Offshore Accommodation Group described Safe as 'a dynamic,
financially-strong, and well-managed group'.
Safe Partners, based in Aberdeen, owns five accommodation rigs which are
mainly deployed in the North Sea. Last year the group made a pre-tax profit
of SKr228m (Dollars 30.4m) on turnover of SKr811m.
Celsius, the Swedish defence group, said yesterday it had sold its 40 per
cent stake in Safe Partners to a Stena company for Dollars 45m.
This gave Stena 100 per cent of the company which it then sold on to OAG.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MCI Communications, the second-largest US long-distance telecommunications
company which is part-owned by BT, the UK telecoms group, is seeking
permission in five states to provide local telephone services in competition
with Baby Bell regional phone operators.
The decision by MCI to seek to provide local telephone services in Illinois,
Maryland, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Washington comes days after the sale of
20 per cent of the company to BT was completed.
Some of the Dollars 4.3bn in cash BT spent on the stake is expected to help
finance MCI's drive into local telephone markets, assuming the company
receives the go-ahead from state regulators to compete with the Baby Bells
in offering various telephone services to business and residential
customers.
MCI wants to operate telephone services in the five states, not only because
it wants access to lucrative local markets, but also because it will be able
to avoid the fees it has to pay the Baby Bells to carry MCI long-distance
traffic within their markets.
In some cases, these fees cost MCI as much as 45 cents of every dollar of
revenue.

revival

When it comes to advising on hostile takeovers, there is no question which
side it pays to represent.
For their work on American Home Products' uninvited run at American Cyanamid
this summer, Gleacher &amp; Co, a small advisory boutique, will receive Dollars
10m. For representing the defending side - which agreed to Home Products'
offer after a 14-day skirmish - Morgan Stanley and CS First Boston will be
paid Dollars 47.6m between them.
The fee levels agreed in extremis by besieged company bosses are often
challenged later by successful acquirers.
With the US takeover market just completing its most active quarter to date,
however, the deal remains a clear sign that the merger and acquisition
advisory business remains one of the few bright spots on Wall Street.
To judge from the bald numbers, it appears that fees paid in the present
takeover wave are well below the levels of the late 1980s. But anecdotal
evidence such as the Cyanamid deal - and the comments of senior takeover
advisers - suggests this is still a lucrative business.
According to Securities Data, the average advisory fee in 1988, at the
height of the last merger wave, was equivalent to 2.88 per cent of the
transaction value: so far this year, it has been 1.25 per cent.
The discrepancy is due largely to the absence of junk bond financing in
1990s takeovers. The underwriting fees associated with raising the debt to
pay for acquisitions accounted for a large part of the money paid to
investment bankers in the 1980s.
Structural changes in the market could also have held down fees.
Mr Felix Rohatyn, head of M&amp;A at Lazard in New York, points to 'the
constantly increasing level of sophistication in the financial departments
of big companies'.
These companies can handle more aspects of an acquisition in-house - and
when they do need to farm work out, they are more aware of fees, Mr Rohatyn
says.
Advisers generally say they are applying the same fee scales they have used
for years, and find companies willing to pay. 'The corporate advisory part
of (takeovers) is really not much different from the 1980s,' says the head
of M&amp;A at one big US investment bank.

Axa, one of France's largest insurance groups, yesterday confirmed details
of its purchase of Boreal Assurances, the Canadian non-life company, for
FFr630m (Dollars 119.31m).
Details of the price - which will be paid in cash - were released two months
after Axa said it would make the acquisition from Suez, the French financial
and industrial holding company.
The purchase is likely to be completed within the next few days, pending
regulatory approvals. Axa said Boreal, added to its existing Canadian
subsidiary, would make it the fourth largest non-life insurance company in
Canada, with annual turnover approaching CDollars 1bn (USDollars 700m). It
controls The Equitable of the US.
The group said it had no immediate plans for rationalisation and Boreal
would continue to operate under its name alongside Axa Canada.

FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Crystal shines light on
executive salaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Sanford Weill, chairman and chief executive of US financial group
Travelers, was overpaid by Dollars 39m last year, according to a report by
an American executive pay expert.
The analysis, by Professor Graef Crystal, found Mr Weill's pay package
totalled Dollars 45.8m in 1993 but that he should have been paid Dollars
6.8m.
The report concludes that over the past three years Mr Weill has been paid
Dollars 90.7m more than he should have been in light of the company's
performance - measured by returns to shareholders - and its size.
'Weill's performance at the company has been excellent,' Prof Crystal says,
'but this shows that even excellent performance can be vastly overpaid. As
far as we are concerned Mr Weill owes his shareholders Dollars 91m, though
we doubt that payment will ever be forthcoming.'
The next most overpaid executive after Mr Weill is Mr Alan Greenberg, chief
executive officer of Bear Stearns, who earned Dollars 16.2m last year. Prof
Crystal says he should have received less than Dollars 4m, a difference of
Dollars 12.3m.
The survey examined the pay packages of the chief executive officers of 200
of the US's largest public companies and it found some large variations.
The lowest paid chief executive officer was Mr Raymond J. Noorda of Novell,
who received Dollars 290,000 last year. The report states that because of
the company's performance and size he should have been paid Dollars 5.7m - a
difference of Dollars 5.4m.
Other CEO's were underpaid, including Mr Bernard Marcus of Home Depot who
has earned a total of Dollars 28m less than he should have done over the
last three years and Dollars 9.5m in 1993 alone.
The average total compensation paid to the 200 chief executive officers in
1993 was about Dollars 3.5m. Prof Crystal was able to find only a small
relationship between the pay of top US executives and the size and
performance of the companies they manage.
However, he found top pay was influenced by geography with 'an extremely
large pay premium predicated on working in the New York area', says Prof
Crystal.
Another important influence was the number of long-term incentive plans the
CEO received during 1993.
The analysis found when a company adds a new long-term incentive plan it
typically fails to cut back the size of awards under the first long-term
incentive plan, or to cut back enough.
'The result is higher and higher total compensation,' says Prof Crystal.
The analysis found that total pay for the 154 top executives that were
included in last year's survey remained about level, after having risen on
average by 21.6 per cent between 1991 and 1992.
Total pay for each executive includes base salary, bonus payments, any
long-term incentive plans, and Prof Crystal's valuation of share options
granted to each executive during 1993.
Total pay is put against a combination of two figures - company performance
over the past 10 years and during each chief executive's tenure, plus
company size - to evaluate the amount each CEO should have been paid last
year.

FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Record third-term sales for AMD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Advanced Micro Devices yesterday reported record third-quarter sales, lifted
by strong demand for microprocessor chips which are used in personal
computers.
The Silicon Valley chip maker also announced a contract to provide
microprocessors to Digital Equipment, one of the fastest growing PC
manufacturers.
The Digital deal represents a breakthrough for AMD, which is battling with
Intel, the market leader, for a bigger share of PC microprocessor sales.
Intel had been Digital's sole supplier of PC microprocessors, and
manufactures a large proportion of Digital's PC products.
Strong sales of microprocessors helped boost AMD's third-quarter revenues to
Dollars 543m, up 30 per cent from Dollars 418m in the same period last year.
Net income for the quarter ending September 25 was Dollars 86.7m before the
payment of preferred stock dividends. After the dividends, quarterly net
income was 86 cents a share, at the low end of Wall Street projections.
Net income for the comparable period last year was Dollars 61.3m before the
preferred stock dividend, or 61 cents a share after the payment.
'Microprocessor sales re-mained at record levels with Am486 microprocessor
sales up 7 per cent over the immediate prior quarter,' said Mr WJ Sanders
III, AMD chairman and chief executive.
Higher than expected yields from AMD's California sub-micron production
facility boosted production volumes, Mr Sanders added.
AMD also announced new 'flash memory' products for notebook computers,
personal communicators and other applications.
During the third quarter the group began production of 16-megabit flash
memory chips at its new Japanese production facility, a joint venture with
Fujitsu.
'We expect revenue from the Fujitsu-AMD facility in the first quarter of
1995,' Mr Sanders said.
With production capacity increasing in both internal facilities and external
foundries, 'we have prospects for continued overall revenue growth in our
fourth quarter, if present market conditions continue', Mr Sanders added.
For the first nine months of 1994, AMD reported total revenues of Dollars
1.59bn, up 29 per cent from Dollars 1.23bn. Net income was Dollars 264.5m
before preferred stock dividends and Dollars 2.64 a share after dividends.
In the same period last year net income was Dollars 187.1m, and per share
income after dividends was Dollars 1.89.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hilmar Kopper, chairman of Deutsche Bank's managing board, yesterday
backed the suggestion that banks should smooth out peaks and troughs in
their earnings by making precautionary provisions against corporate loans.
Speaking at a briefing in Madrid to coincide with the annual meetings of the
IMF/World Bank, Mr Kopper said Deutsche was 'quite ready to participate in a
discussion' on the broader use of general provisions, an idea raised by Mr
Brian Quinn, the Bank of England's executive director for financial
stability.
Mr Kopper argued that Deutsche's loan provisioning policy was already closer
to Mr Quinn's suggestion than other financial institutions, and that there
was 'wider scope' for the use of general provisions from other banks.
'A lot of analysts in the market do not understand what a bank like our's
does when it talks about far-reaching provisions,' said Mr Kopper.
Mr Quinn suggested in a speech last week that banks could counter swings in
earnings over economic cycles by making general provisions against corporate
loans when they are made rather than waiting for defaults.
The idea would face some accounting difficulties because auditors might
argue that a bank was artificially undervaluing its assets, although banks
currently use the approach for consumer loan portfolios.
Mr Kopper disclosed that Deutsche had decided to use its own name for its
Italian subsidiary Banca d'America e d'Italia.

FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: S Africa wins investment grade
rating from Moody's

South Africa's foreign borrowing plans were given a boost last night when
Moody's, the US credit rating agency, gave the republic's sovereign debt an
'investment grade' rating.
However, Standard and Poor's, the other big US agency, awarded a lower
rating.
Mr Chris Liebenberg, South Africa's minister of finance, last night welcomed
Moody's Baa3 rating, saying it demonstrated 'confidence in the coherence of
the economic policies and political stability brought to the country by the
government of national unity'.
He noted that Standard and Poor's, which awarded a BB or sub-investment
grade rating, had also said it saw a 'positive outlook' for the country.
South Africa had been seeking an international credit rating since April's
elections brought President Nelson Mandela's government to power. However,
its first formal rating, from the European agency IBCA, was a disappointing
BB, putting it on a par with countries such as Mexico, Hungary and
Argentina.
Officials said they were pleased with Moody's higher rating, which rates
South Africa ahead of both Mexico and India.
Moody's said the rating was based on the country's low external debt, and on
the commitment by the new government to redirect spending to a comprehensive
development programme while reducing the public sector deficit.
Mr Carlos Cordeiro, a partner with Goldman Sachs, the investment bank which
is advising the government, said he was 'delighted' with the rating. It
would allow South Africa to 'access a wider range of capital around the
world', he said.
South Africa has borrowed money in European markets without an official
rating, but yesterday's news will permit it to re-enter the US market. In
its June budget, the government said it would raise R1.8bn (Dollars 504.8m)
from the international capital markets in the current financial year.
External debt has been paid down in net terms since 1985, when international
banks refused to roll over loans to the republic, in response to political
unrest.
South Africa's return to the international bond markets could be in the form
of a global bond of around Dollars 500m, said Mr Liebenberg, Reuter adds
from Madrid.
However, Mr Liebenberg, in Madrid for the IMF/World Bank meeting, said that
no firm decisions had been made and it was up to the markets to set the
parameters for the issue.
He said that apart from the global format, South Africa was considering a
plain eurobond and even a yankee bond.

The depth of the 1992 Finnish banking sector crisis was highlighted
yesterday when Unitas, the country's second largest banking group, announced
heavier write-offs and another big loss for the first eight months of the
year.
The bank said its credit losses, at FM1.82bn (Dollars 374m), were FM137m
higher than in the same 1993 period.
It relied on lower interest rates, higher capital gains on equities and the
acquisition of part of the Savings Bank of Finland to achieve a 14 per cent
reduction in overall pre-tax losses, to FM870m from FM1.01bn.
A large part of Unitas's credit losses in the first eight months was caused
by the collapse of two groups - Haka, a construction concern, and Eka, a
retail and wholesale company.

FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: JAL set to reveal heavy
unrealised forex loss
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan Airlines is poised to disclose a long-suspected unrealised foreign
exchange loss amounting to many billions of yen, the result of a misjudged
currency hedge.
The group, Japan's largest airline, refused to confirm reports that its
unrealised loss stood at Y45bn (Dollars 450m). It said details of its
finances would be published with the interim earnings report on October 28.
A company official did confirm the existence of a 10-year Dollars 3.6bn
forward currency contract, taken out in 1986. JAL began taking out forward
dollar agreements after the 1985 Plaza Accord to curb the dollar, at that
time valued at Y240. According to market reports, unconfirmed by JAL, the
airline contracted to buy dollars at an average rate of Y185, against the
current rate of Y99.58.
JAL is among several large Japanese companies expected to declare heavy
currency losses when they report first-half results at the end of this month
and early in November.
Until now, companies have been able to subsume currency losses in
depreciation and operating costs. However, the finance ministry has demanded
that listed companies declare unrealised profits or losses from forward
currency trading, starting in the current tax year.
JAL needs to raise an average of Dollars 800m a year for buying aircraft,
about 40 per cent of which it finances through forward rate agreements such
as this, with the remainder raised at current exchange rates, said the
official.
The aim of the new disclosure rules, introduced from the end of March, is to
avoid shocks such as the Y165bn foreign exchange loss on unauthorised
dealings at Showa Shell, an oil refiner, in February last year and the
Y152.5bn currency deficit from Kashima Oil, another refiner, in April.
The early indications of JAL's loss have already caused a mild shock,
sending the share price down 1.3 per cent to Y737 in Tokyo yesterday.

FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Unravelling the Banesto tangle -
Chairman Alfredo Saenz talks to Tom Burns about the Conde legacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The modern building on Madrid's central Castellana boulevard where Mr
Alfredo Saenz has his office is an ironic example of the problems that he,
Spain's best-known banking troubleshooter, has inherited from Mr Mario
Conde, his predecessor at Banesto.
In 1990 Mr Conde, seeking to build up Banesto's balance sheet, sold a real
estate group which owned the bank's Castellana offices to a business
associate at a greatly inflated price. As the associate, who owned the
leisure group Oasis, did not have the cash for the acquisition, Mr Conde had
Banesto lend it to him. Oasis could not meet the interests on the loan, so
Mr Conde arranged to have Banesto lease the building over 12 years, paying
in rent the equivalent of the loan's principle and interest.
'What do you make of a deal like that?' asks Mr Saenz in his first interview
as chairman of Banesto. He is now in the middle of what he calls a 'divorce'
from Oasis (Mr Conde had Banesto's Industrial Corporation buy 50 per cent of
the leisure group). Banesto is suing Oasis over a business arrangement that
Mr Saenz, choosing his words carefully, says was not 'fair'.
Mr Saenz arrived at Banesto as caretaker chairman on December 28, hours
after the Bank of Spain, alleging gross mismanagement of the the banking
group, had removed Mr Conde and his fellow board members. Four months later,
Banesto was acquired for Pta281bn (Dollars 2.2bn) by Banco Santander.
Mr Saenz has a variety of messes to sort out, and some will undoubtably end
up with the public prosecutors who are examining Mr Conde's business
dealings during his six-year reign as chairman. But he is also quietly
confident that he will rebuild Banesto's 2,500 domestic branch unit into a
leading Spanish retail bank.
The bank was on course to lose some Pta55bn this year. However, the
haemorrhage was already stemmed in the first half - losses stood at
Pta21.8bn at the end of June - and the shortfall could be down to some
Pta12bn by December. Between January and June, Banesto lost Pta495bn worth
of deposits, 12 per cent of the total, but in the third quarter it recovered
Pta230bn.
The recovery is being fuelled by a rescue plan involving a Pta180bn capital
injection, the purchase of Pta285bn worth of non-performing assets by the
Deposit Guarantee Fund, and a zero-interest loan of Pta315bn to offset
current losses. Banesto's chairman is managing by far the largest lifeboat
operation mounted for a Spanish bank.
Mr Saenz is also immersed in ridding Banesto of its industrial assets.
Recent disposals - involving the battery producer Tudor, the mining company
Asturiana de Zinc and the Rioja winery Bodegas Age - has raised some
Pta45bn. Banesto's shareholdings in two television stations and in a
newspaper group, which were bought by Mr Conde as a platform for his
possible entry into politics and have proved costly investments, are also up
for sale.
With the worst behind him, Mr Saenz is talking about expansion. 'Next year
we will begin to open 100 new offices, and they will in good urban
locations: in Madrid, in Catalonia and in the Basque Country.'
'When I got here I didn't know where the bathrooms were, let alone the
documents, and the first weeks were horrible,' he recalls. He turned himself
into an auditor - 'one of the enlightened sort' - and into a consultant. 'In
a question of weeks, I had to discover what the possibilities of a recovery
were and where the bank should go if it did recover.'
Mr Saenz, who had been 'lent' by his employers, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, where
he was first vice-president, to sort out the Banesto mess, readily accepted
Santander's offer to stay on as chairman. 'The Bank of Spain kept dropping
me hints that I was part of the Banesto acquisition package.'
What Mr Emilio Botn, chairman of Santander, acquired when he bought Banesto
was a plain-talking Basque-born professional. Mr Saenz, 52, who worked in
the steel industry before joining Banco Vizcaya (later merged with Banco
Bilbao to form BBV) in 1981, made his reputation by turning around Banca
Catalana, a bankrupt Barcelona-based institution acquired by Vizcaya from
the Guarantee Fund.
Mr Saenz is delighted with the financial muscle that Banco Santander
provides, and with the 'total management freedom' that Mr Botn has given
Banesto's new team, all of whom followed the new chairman from BBV.
'If we foul up, Santander will kick us out at the next AGM,' he says. 'Those
are rules of the game that we understand and we are happy to live with
them.'
Inherent to the 'rules' are that Banesto will be competing directly with
Santander - it will open a branch next door to one of its parent's if it
believes there are sound business reasons for doing so. Mr Saenz is keen to
segment the Banesto business between its strong rural network, the bank's
traditional cash cow, and the urban branches he plans to develop.
'I know Emilio Botn very well and I know that real competition, gripping a
knife in your teeth, is exactly what he expects. It would be a mistake, in
any case, to act differently; at Catalana we competed ferociously with BBV.'
Santander owns 67.9 per cent of Banesto but, as part of its acquisition
arrangement, will this week be disposing of 13.7 per cent of its equity to
existing shareholders. It will offer one new share for every two held at par
value of Pta400.
'I would be very surprised if the shareholders don't wholly subscribe the
offer,' says Mr Saenz. If the offering is successful, it will not be just
because of the give-away pricing. Battered by the Conde experience, the
shareholders will, like the shrewd Mr Botn, be putting their faith in a very
different chairman.

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Snia BPD, the fibres, chemicals and biotechnology subsidiary of Fiat, lifted
operating profits by nearly 50 per cent and more than doubled pre-tax
profits in the first half of 1994, writes Andrew Hill in Milan.
The group, quoted on the Milan stock exchange, increased pre-tax profits to
L26.8bn (Dollars 17.2m) in the first six months of the year, from L12.1bn in
the year-ago period. Operating profits rose to L54.6bn on turnover of
L1,337bn, up 16.7 per cent on turnover for the first six months of 1993.
The group attributed the strong performance mainly toimprovement in the
fibres division, headed by its quoted subsidiary Snia Fibre. It returned to
an operating profit of L10.3bn in the first half, compared with a loss of
L11.7bn a year earlier.
Snia BPD said it expected its full-year pre-tax result to show 'a
significant improvement' on 1993, thanks partly to a continued reduction in
financial charges.
By contrast, Cogefar-Impresit, the Fiat construction subsidiary, is still
suffering from the downturn in the Italian public works sector. It announced
a consolidated loss of L36bn for the first half.

Turnover improved from Pounds 34.6m to Pounds 38m.
Mr Edward Gates, chairman, said it was largely due to the 30 per cent rise

reduced on last year's.
Combined sales of new and used cars showed a 20 per cent increase. However,
departmental profits fell 18 per cent, with profits from the sale of used
cars almost three times those from the sale of new vehicles as margins

However, Lawrie Group, the tea and coffee producer and Camellia's main

FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Shoprite shares fall on further profits
warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shoprite, the discount food retailing chain which operates mainly in
Scotland, yesterday issued its second profits warning in four months, saying
it expected only to break even at operating level this year.
Shares in the Isle of Man-based group fell 4p to 28p as it issued a
statement warning that trading was still 'very difficult'.
Shoprite's shares peaked at 243p in February, when they were the best
performers in the food retailing sector, but slumped after the group rushed
out its interim results prematurely in May because they were below
expectations.
After a planned sale and leaseback deal on stores fell through in June,
Shoprite said in July it was cutting back its store expansion, selling
non-core assets, and expected full-year profits to be significantly below
last year.
Mr Charles Good, managing director for Scotland, said yesterday that as the
group now looked likely only to break even at operating level in the year to
October 30, it had decided to issue a further statement.
Shoprite, a classic 'hard' discounter with more than 80 stores in Scotland
selling a limited number of goods in no-frills surroundings, has suffered
badly from the intense price competition - centred on basic goods - in the
grocery market over the past year.
Mr Good said trading had remained 'extremely difficult' over the summer,
although he was pleased with the results of Shoprite's latest initiatives,
including a television advertising campaign, repositioning of its product
range, and further price cuts on basic products.
'We have got to hope that we have been through the trough,' he said.
He added that the disposal programme was progressing 'satisfactorily' with
some significant deals in the pipeline.

FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Research spending pushes up losses at
Chiroscience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chiroscience Group, the biotechnology company which floated in February,
yesterday unveiled a divisional restructuring and plans to acquire a
manufacturing plant.
The move follows a six-month operational review by Mr John Padfield, chief
executive, who is determined to broaden the group's customer base. 'We must
refocus the group to maximise our opportunities,' he said.
The company has been reorganised into two operating divisions: one focused
on manufacturing synthons - the chemical components used by drug companies
in new products - and the other on developing its own drug portfolio.
Mr Chris Evans, the company's founder and chief scientist, will no longer
have a role in the day-to-day management of the division but will oversee
'strategic issues' as a non-executive director.
Among these, the group has identified Levobupivacaine, its single isomer
local anaesthetic, as a potential 'blockbuster' in a market worth an
estimated Dollars 200m a year. It is discussing collaborative ventures with
several leading drug companies to further develop the drug, which has begun
phase two clinical trials.
It is also confident that Dexketoprofen, its anti-inflammatory drug, will
begin to contribute profits next year following its anticipated launch by
Menarini, Italy's largest domestic drugs company.
Research spending helped push up pre-tax losses from Pounds 1.33m to Pounds
3.75m in the six months to August 31, in line with expectations. Costs were
partly offset by gross profits of Pounds 391,000 (Pounds 745,000), but the
figures were dented by administrative expenses of Pounds 814,000 (Pounds
437,000) following increased recruitment.
Costs will increase further in the second half as another 60 staff are hired
to boost research. After this year's Pounds 45m rights issue, however, the
company still has Pounds 34m (Pounds 8.6m) in cash and investments to fund
future expenditure.
Turnover was Pounds 757,000 (Pounds 1.34m) and losses per share 5.5p (4.7p),
with no dividend.

FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: CI returns to black with Pounds 0.34m
midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CI Group, the Wolverhampton-based engineer, returned to profit during the
1994 first half as trading performance improved after taking losses in the
second half of the previous year.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to July 31 were Pounds 337,000 against
Pounds 905,000 in the 1993 first half and a loss for the year to January 31
1994 of Pounds 1.53m.
'We are showing an improvement which we believe will be on-going,' said Mr
Rob Yates, the chief executive.
In the second half of last year, CI suffered difficult trading and charged
the costs of a redundancy programme and the disposal of a lossmaking French
company.
Turnover was Pounds 35.9m, against Pounds 35.3m, including Pounds 3.13m from
discontinued activities, resulting in a 12 per cent increase in continuing
operations.
Earnings per share were 0.26p (0.69p) against losses of 1.54p for the whole
of the previous year. The interim dividend is being halved at 0.2p.
The company said that all but one of its businesses enjoyed better trading
than in the previous half year.
Those supplying the construction industry improved largely through
cost-cutting, while the re-rolling, foundry and reinforcement businesses,
although trading better than at any time in 1993, faced raw material price
increases.

FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind advance at Badgerline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Badgerline, the Avon-based bus group, reported interim pre-tax profits more
than doubled from Pounds 2.56m to Pounds 5.39m, primarily as a result of
maiden contributions from acquisitions in West Yorkshire and Staffordshire.
Turnover, boosted by revenues from Rider and PMT Group, increased from
Pounds 63.9m to Pounds 93.3m, but the group's core business showed a rise of
6 per cent in revenues and an 8 per cent improvement in operating profit to
Pounds 5.46m (Pounds 5.05m). The interest charge was cut from Pounds 2.72m
to Pounds 2.4m.
Mr Trevor Smallwood, chairman, said: 'The second half has started well, with
the group continuing to improve its performance compared with last year. Our
policy remains one of additional margin enhancements and the pursuit of
further acquisitions.'
He said acquisitions had performed in line with budget. The two companies
achieved profits of Pounds 2.32m, with operating margins of 9.1 per cent,
compared with the 8 per cent recorded from its existing bus business.
Rider, which operates in Leeds, Bradford, Halifax, Huddersfield and York,
has operating margins of 9.5 per cent, against 17 per cent for Badgerline's
City Line in Bristol.
The group is rapidly increasing expenditure on new buses. It purchased 245
in the first half of the year, and will bring in a further 104 in the second
half, and 450 a year over the next two years.
Rider is taking on 170 new vehicles to help reduce high engineering costs
from an ageing fleet, and to give it greater flexibility on routes, through
the introduction of a broader range of vehicles.
Badgerline was listed in November, and provided early disappointment by
announcing that it was writing down the value of its Bath depot by Pounds
7.8m, after failing to get permission for its redevelopment into a retail
centre.
Mr Smallwood said yesterday that Safeway was planning to revise and resubmit
plans for the development, which provide the possibility of a subsequent
write-back of asset values.
The company is to pay a 1.5p interim dividend, and has indicated that it
will pay a 3p final. Earnings emerged at 3.6p (3.2p) or 3.5p (2.6p) fully
diluted.
COMMENT
Badgerline has been the tortoise of one of the market's racier sectors, with
depot write-downs being followed by a somewhat pedestrian operating
performance. Its shares fell 6p to 119p, leaving it on a price-earnings
ratio of 12.6 and yield of 4.7 per cent, based on forecasts of Pounds 16m
for the year. However, it is negotiating further acquisitions and has
greater efficiencies to generate from its Pounds 61m of recent purchases. It
is in a growth sector, and at the current share price it looks undervalued.

FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Further disposals at Lucas Industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The streamlining of Lucas Industries will continue with the sale of Lucas
Management Systems, a software business, and the possible sale of Lucas
Engineering &amp; Systems, a consultancy specialising in manufacturing systems.
The disposals continue a line of divestments dating back to 1992 but come in
immediate response to a review of the Lucas business which was undertaken by
Mr George Simpson, chief executive since last April.
That review, Lucas noted yesterday, had concluded that resources should be
increasingly directed at the group's automotive and aerospace interests, and
further divestments were in prospect.
'We cannot have so many irons in the fire. There must be a focusing down to
the real core businesses within Lucas,' Mr Simpson said in August.
The two companies up for sale are part of the group's old applied technology
division, now increasingly concentrated on the manufacture of electronic
products.
Management Systems is based at Slough, following extensive cutbacks in
1992-93. It has annual sales of about Pounds 45m and employs 800 people.
Engineering &amp; Systems, whose business is based on sales within the Lucas
group, has turnover of about Pounds 20m and a staff of 400.
Lucas would not say whether the companies were profitable.

FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: UK sales setback for Betterware
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Betterware, the direct home-shopping group, yesterday reported a 48 per cent
decline in interim pre-tax profits after its core UK sales shrunk by 9 per
cent.
The group's shares shed 1p to 36p, well down from its peak of 278p in July
last year. The drop in total turnover to Pounds 31.7m (Pounds 34.4m) was
blamed on 'a loss of momentum' among its sales force.
Betterware lost around 1,000 salesmen, or more than 9 per cent of its
distributors, after opening a Pounds 10m distribution centre in Birmingham
in January. The company said it had now recovered from the centre's
'teething troubles', which included unreliable stock delivery.
Analysts cut their full-year forecasts for the second time in less than a
month, from Pounds 9m to about Pounds 6.5m, in spite of company assurances
that recruitment was improving and that average orders were holding steady
at Pounds 8. Betterware lost more than a third of its market value two weeks
ago, after issuing its third profits warning in five months.
Mr Peter Hartley, finance director, said the poor pre-tax profit figure was
partly the result of the group's investment companies reporting an operating
loss of Pounds 405,000 (Pounds 151,000 profit).
Profits for the 28 weeks to September 10 also suffered from new investment
in computer-aided product design and start-up costs in Germany and Spain,
which form part of the company's strategy of international expansion.
Last month, the company committed itself to providing up to Dollars 5m
(Pounds 3.1m) over time in a joint venture with Avon, the direct seller of
beauty products, to sell household goods in North and South America.
'I would point to the Avon deal as an absolute demonstration that the
strategy of internationalisation is the correct one,' said Mr Hartley. 'I
understand that the market needs short-term profit, that you cannot just
promise jam tomorrow, but you also have to continue on a strategy that will
develop in the future.'
Earnings per share were halved at 2.53p (5p). The interim dividend was 0.85p
(0.65p).

FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Bilton edges ahead to Pounds 9.06m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Patchy trading conditions in the south-east industrial property market were
yesterday blamed by Bilton for the marginal improvement in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 8.99m to Pounds 9.06m for the half year to June 30.
Investment income fell from Pounds 11.16m to Pounds 11.11m, and Mr Tim
Goodwin, finance director, said that rents remained under pressure. 'Rental
levels are flat and it is difficult to say what is going to happen.'
The net asset value declined from 372p to 325p a share following the 11 per
cent drop in the value of the group's property investment portfolio reported
in April.
Earnings per share were flat at 7.1p, while the interim dividend improved
marginally to 2.89p (2.84p).
Turnover from ordinary activities at the trading level increased by 23 per
cent to Pounds 5.88m (Pounds 4.78m).
Trading conditions in the housebuilding, plant hire and contracting side
were difficult. Mr Hugh Free, the chairman, commented: 'Profitable work
remains scarce and the housing market continues to be uncertain.'
Rents receivable improved slightly at Pounds 12.52m (Pounds 12.5m), although
there was an increase in ground rents which affected the overall investment
income.
Mr Goodwin said there were a few positive signs within the property sector,
such as fewer companies closing and a corresponding rise in the number of
companies renewing leases.
However, he added that conditions remained too uncertain to comment on the
trading outlook for the full year.

FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: ABF buys manufacturing base in US from
Karlshamns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Associated British Foods has bought the US operations of Karlshamns, the
Swedish foods group, giving the UK company its first manufacturing presence
in the US.
ABF will use the subsidiary, to be renamed Abitec Corporation, as a base for
making a wide variety of food ingredients. These will include stabilisers
and emulsifiers which it already sells in British and continental markets to
makers of bread, ice-cream, soups and other foods.
'We've been looking for a way to get into food ingredients in the US because
they are more remunerative than some packaged foods,' Mr Garry Weston, ABF
chairman, said.
In common with other UK bakers, ABF has come under severe pricing pressure
from supermarkets' own-label breads. ABF, the UK's leading baker, produces
under its own brands such as Allinson's as well as supermarkets' brands.
The assets being bought include a plant in Columbus, Ohio, and one in
Janesville, Wisconsin, which process vegetable oils to produce food
ingredients and products for healthcare. It makes a small profit on annual
turnover of Dollars 150m (Pounds 95m).
ABF had been negotiating with Karlshamns for more than a year. It declined
to disclose the purchase price. The Swedish group, which had over-extended
by expanding rapidly overseas during the last decade, has had to retrench by
selling some subsidiaries.
'Over the next four or five years we will have invested about Dollars 100m'
in US manufacturing, Mr Weston said. Turnover of Abitec Corporation could
double over the same period.

FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: QS continues progress with Pounds 2.22m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QS Holdings, the discount clothing retailer, continued the progress made in
the second half of 1993 as it reported a 25 per cent increase in profits in
the six months to July 29.
Profits at Pounds 2.22m pre-tax, against last time's low Pounds 1.68m, were
struck on turnover ahead 17 per cent at Pounds 28.7m (Pounds 24.7m). The
interim dividend is held at 1.56p from earnings per share of 3.43p (2.79p).
Last time's payment was also maintained in spite of a profits fall.
Yesterday the shares eased 3p to 170p.
There was no price inflation in the profits increase. There was no profits
rise for continuing stores partly because the group does not count stores
closed and then reopened in a different location.
During the period QS opened its 100th store - in Bristol - and by July 31
had 101 shops. In the six months the sales area increased by 7.5 per cent to
233,540 sq ft with the new stores in Luton, Bedford, Weston-super-Mare and
Bristol.
Already the group has exceeded its target of adding a further 10 per cent of
selling space in the year. So far it has added 12 per cent with stores in
Harrow, Lowestoft, an extension in Croydon and the relocation to larger
premises in Fareham.
Net cash stood at Pounds 5.7m, unchanged from the January 28 amount, as were
stock levels. Interest receivable fell to Pounds 133,000 (Pounds 254,000).
Other operating income doubled to Pounds 126,000.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ's attempts to develop the Lihir gold mine in Papua New Guinea have taken
a positive turn, with the newly installed government of Sir Julius Chan
promising to speed up talks over a special mining licence.
It is estimated that Lihir will produce 589,000 ounces of gold a year for
the first eight years, with sufficient reserves for 37 years of production.
RTZ currently owns 80 per cent of the mine, with Niu Guinea Mining owning
the remainder. However, the project's equity structure remains under
negotiation.
RTZ also announced yesterday the sale of its Ridgeway Gold mine to
Toronto-based Kinross Gold for Dollars 47m (Pounds 29.7m).
Ridgeway is expected to produce 125,000 ounces of gold this.

<TEXT>
National Power has reached a settlement with Transco Energy of Houston, the
gas trading company, over a dispute arising from its Dollars 150m purchase
last year of American National Power from that company. Litigation between
the two companies has now been withdrawn.
As part of the settlement, Transco has agreed to exercise its right of first
refusal to buy back TrenFuels, a fuel services company and ANP subsidiary.
National Power has received Dollars 12.5m for TrenFuels, which it says was
not material to ANP's generation business.
National Power's obligation to Transco to settle some balance sheet issues
has been agreed at Dollars 8m. It has received the net sum of Dollars 4.5m
from Transco, which it says will not affect its 1994/95 earnings.

FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: BFI says US practices would cut Attwoods'
eps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Under US accounting practices for goodwill, earnings at Attwoods, the UK
waste services group, would be more than halved.
That is one of the main points stressed in the offer document for the group
published yesterday by Browning-Ferris Industries, the Texas-based waste
management group, which launched a hostile Pounds 364m bid last month.
BFI is offering 109p cash for each ordinary share - just above the year's
low of 105p. But using US accounting methods, estimated 1994 earnings would
be cut from 5.3p to 2.5p, the document says.
At that level, the offer represents a premium of more than 115 per cent, BFI
claims. If the group were to trade at the average multiple for US waste
companies of 19 times, 'Attwoods shares should be valued at around 50p'.
In the US, goodwill is written off through the profit and loss account over
up to 40 years.
In the UK it is taken through the balance sheet. At the end of July 1993
Attwoods had Pounds 179.1m of goodwill written off.
BFI, which attacks Attwoods financial record as 'dismal', says that as the
company makes 65 per cent of its operating profits in the US, a proper
comparison with other US waste companies should reflect US accounting
standards.
'All we are trying to do is compare apples with apples,' said Mr Greg
Muldoon, senior vice-president at BFI. 'Attwoods earnings are inflated by US
standards.'
Attwoods yesterday said the offer document provided 'no further
justification for the wholly inadequate offer outlined in its original press
announcement.' Mr Ken Foreman, chief executive, said BFI was making its
offer to address its own weaknesses in Attwoods markets. It was 'an
unintended compliment to our strengths.'
BFI also argues that Attwoods is not prepared to meet the challenges facing
the waste management industry, and would perform much better if it were not
standing alone. It criticises Attwoods' narrow focus on waste collection in
North America.
At the same time BFI sees Attwoods UK business, which is more integrated, as
an important step in its plans to expand into Europe.
BFI has already won the support of Laidlaw, of Canada, Attwoods' largest
shareholder with 29.8 per cent of the ordinary shares and 73 per cent of the
preference stock.
Laidlaw, which has three of its directors on Attwoods' board, has agreed to
sell its ordinary shares at Dollars 8.50 per American Depositary Receipt -
equivalent to five ordinary shares - and its preference shares at 85p even
if a second bidder entered with a higher offer.

FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: MGN lifts Scottish TV stake to 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior executives from Mirror Group Newspapers and Scottish Television are
to meet within the next week following the disclosure yesterday that MGN had
increased its stake in STV from 15 to 20 per cent.
Sources at STV said that the meeting had been sought by MGN, although the
subjects for discussion were not known. MGN refused to comment.
A statement from STV said: 'The purchase of the balance of 5 per cent of STV
shares was anticipated and takes MGN's stake to 19.99 per cent, the maximum
allowed by the cross media ownership rules under the Broadcasting Act. MGN
has reiterated its announcement of support for STV and its management.'
MGN, through its subsidiary the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail,
bought 2.45m shares in STV at 520p per share at a total cost of Pounds
12.7m. The move follows the dawn raid of two weeks ago which netted the
publishing group a 14.9 per cent stake for Pounds 37.4m.
Then Mr Murdoch MacLennan, chief executive of the Scottish Daily Record, had
said: 'We do not believe it is necessary for the two companies to come under
common control for these benefits to be achieved.'
STV shares closed down 1p at 493p. MGN shares were unchanged at 129p.
Carlton Communications is paying Pounds 20m for the 10 per cent of shares it
does not own in Carlton Television Holdings. The Telegraph and Gemina
Investments, which each took a 5 per cent stake in the subsidiary prior to
Carlton's successful franchise bid in 1991, will receive their payments as
shares in the parent group. The payment to the Telegraph includes the cost
of the original Pounds 1.3m investment, and for Pounds 2.1m of loan stock.

FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Power talks behind schedule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MCMANUS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Power Corporation, the Irish property company, has signalled that
negotiations on a vital new equity injection are not going as well as had
been hoped.
The company said it had only a 'reasonable prospect' of concluding a deal
under which Insas, the quoted Malaysian property company, would invest
IPounds 50m (Pounds 49.4m) and take a 49.2 per cent stake. A placing with
outside investors and an open offer to raise an additional IPounds 50m is
also planned.
The negotiations with Insas are behind schedule, admits Mr Tony Leonard,
Power's managing director, but he maintains that there are no major
stumbling blocks. 'We have come across points that took longer to negotiate
than expected,' he said.
Mr Robin Power, the chairman, blamed the delays on the 'complexity of the
transaction, different time zones in Kuala Lumpur, the US, London and Dublin
and the number of parties involved.'
The deal has to be approved by the syndicate of 14 banks which are currently
owed IPounds 220m and are supporting Power. Mr Leonard is hopeful the deal
will be completed by the 'end of autumn,' but said there was no deadline.
Power, which desperately needs the new equity injection, has announced
pre-tax losses of IPounds 13.4m for the year to the end of March. Last
year's losses of IPounds 104.86m were one of the largest ever reported by a
quoted Irish company, and were due mainly to exceptional write-offs of
IPounds 97.1m to cover Power's exposure to the bankrupt Trocadero
development in London and falls in the value of its property portfolio in
Ireland, Britain and the US.
Trading losses have been cut from IPounds 7.7m to IPounds 5.2m as a result
of property disposals and reductions in overheads, according to Mr Leonard.
Power's auditors have drawn attention to the current status of the group's
banking arrangements in their opinion in the accounts, which have not yet
been published. The auditors also draw attention to the negotiations on debt
restructuring and the outcome of a compensation claim, but have not
qualified the accounts according to Power.
Power is currently pursuing a claim against the Los Angeles Unified School
District which has abandoned a compulsory purchase of a site owned by Power
in Los Angeles.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Deutsche to tighten ties with Morgan Grenfell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank is to attempt to strengthen co-operation with its merchant
banking subsidiary Morgan Grenfell in a move that could lead to the
integration of their investment banking operations in several years' time.
Deutsche is likely to announce later this month changes in its relationship
with Morgan, which it acquired five years ago. It will also try to combine
and bolster its European equity broking activities. Mr Hilmar Kopper,
chairman of Deutsche's managing board, said yesterday that attempts to build
up its equity operations would not require a formal change in its agreement
with Morgan.
He said there would be 'no dramatic changes to what we are doing in London',
and that Deutsche was 'particularly happy' with its arrangements with
Morgan. 'No fantastic announcements will be made', he said.
However, a working group of four members of Deutsche's managing board,
including Mr John Craven, Morgan's chairman, believes that the merchant
banks should work more closely with Deutsche.
The review of investment banking carried out by the group is likely to lead
to a statement that Deutsche is strengthening its equity distribution in
London and wants closer links with Morgan's advisory activities.
Deutsche's board is likely to say that Morgan's merchant banking and
advisory operations could eventually be brought together with its own under
a single management, but this could take about five years.
Five of Morgan's eight activities - asset management, Channel Islands Trust
operations, emerging markets debt and equity trading, development capital
and treasury, will be unaffected by the initial changes.
Its equity distribution and project finance activities in Asia are likely to
be more closely integrated with Deutsche's activity in the region, although
stopping short of a full merger. Corporate advisory and equity underwriting
in Europe, as well as project and export finance advice will be linked more
closely with Deutsche. Senior directors want to deliver an integrated range
of services and products to large companies ranging from corporate finance
to lending and foreign exchange and derivatives.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Warburg sends shivers through the City: Norma Cohen and
Nicholas Denton study the lessons of the largest UK investment bank's profit
warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For British investment banks watchful of the experience of New York firms
and already facing the prospect of a severe trading setback, yesterday's
news from SG Warburg could not have been more worrying.
Interim profits for the group, the largest in the investment banking sector,
will be less than half those in the 1993 period. Given that asset management
has held up, that implies that profits from investment banking have almost
totally dried up.
Warburg, like the integrated US investment banks which reported sharply
lower first-half results, has suffered from volatile bond, equities and
derivatives markets. Yesterday's news still came as a surprise. 'I was
really astonished,' said Mr Martin Cross, analyst at UBS. 'I had not
entertained that profits could be Pounds 100m lower.'
It appears unlikely, however, that there will be any immediate moves to sack
staff or withdraw from key businesses. 'I suspect that there will be a
tightening of the cost line but no major review of strategy, no major
soul-searching,' said Mr Philip Gibbs, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
'There may be a slightly more cautious approach and a slowing of
recruitment.'
Nor do Warburg's rivals expect any abrupt change in strategy. 'I wouldn't
have thought for a minute that they would make a decision like that based on
one set of results,' said the head of market making at one of Warburg's
leading competitors.
There does appear little prospect of an upturn in trading profits. Warburg's
performance also prompts questions as to the profitability of market-making
and the sense of Warburg's strategy of becoming a US-style integrated
investment bank.
'The problem is that these bad times don't last long enough,' said the head
of operations at another large investment bank. 'If they did, there would be
a good shake-out.'
But the so-called integrated approach that Warburg has taken - emulating the
model set by its larger US competitors - is a strategy which requires a
significant trading presence.
It assumes that without trading activities, investment banks cannot compete
for the primary market business of underwriting and placing blocks of
securities, nor can they act effectively as a broker between buyers and
sellers.
'If you deal in secondary markets (buying and selling securities of a
particular issuer), you have a much better chance of getting primary market
(underwriting new issues) business. This is the gospel now,' said Mr Gibbs.
The largest US investment banks have pioneered integrated investment banking
which enables them to offer a corporate client a range of services. Such an
approach does not require a move away from trading activities but means
using marketmaking, proprietary trading and the creation of derivatives
products for individual clients to generate fee-based income. The advantage
of this is that it balances the low-returns but more constant income from
fees and commissions with the highly cyclical gains from trading activities.
For all the strategic logic of Warburg's attempt to turn itself into a
full-service investment bank, it has been an expensive venture. 'To protect
one business - corporate advisory - you go into another which has very low
returns and is incredibly risky and competitive,' Mr Gibbs said.
Warburg is more heavily exposed to trading profits - profits derived from
using its own capital to buy and sell securities - than most of its
competitors. According to Mr Gibbs, 70 per cent of Warburg's profits came
from dealing last year.
Warburg denied that it had lost money on trading on its own account. But Mr
David Poutney of stockbroker Collins Stewart was sceptical. 'I perceive they
have blown their socks off on proprietary trading. If you look at the others
they are all ahead at the half-way stage.'
Kleinwort Benson has adopted such an approach, with impressive results. It
too reported a sharp fall in trading income in the second quarter of 1994,
but its overall profitability rose, thanks to a sharp increase in fee and
commission income.
Few of Warburg's competitors yesterday took the opportunity to question the
company's strategy of integration. 'The strategy has to be right for where
they are now,' said an executive at a rival merchant bank. 'If you take
bigger and more aggressive positions, then this sort of thing inevitably
happens. The test is to see how much money they can make when things go
well.'
Warburg's timing has not been the best. It began to make markets more
aggressively and take positions just as the bond and equity markets turned.
It could recoup its losses. 'Perhaps the investing public is going to have
to get used to these firms having more volatility in their results than
before,' Mr Cross said.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Europe reaches for its cereal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French are abandoning their croissants, Belgians their rolls and
Italians their habit of nothing but espresso. Across Europe, people are
swapping their traditional breakfasts for a bowl of processed grain and cold
milk. The European market for breakfast cereals has grown in recent years to
be worth some Pounds 1bn annually.
Even during recession, most countries have increased consumption. For
example, sales in France, the second largest European market for cereal
after the UK, increased by 21 per cent in the year to May 1993.
Europe has become an increasingly competitive market for cereal
manufacturers. The recent acquisition of two cereal companies by the Dutch
food and drinks company BolsWessanen, giving it almost 10 per cent of the
European cereal market overnight, has brought into the open what industry
insiders have known for some time.
To compete seriously, companies must have the market share and financial
muscle to back new products with heavy advertising. This year, Kellogg is
estimated to be spending Pounds 6m in the UK alone to support its Corn Pops
brand.
Harrison &amp; Crosfield, the UK conglomerate which sold, the companies to
BolsWessanen, admitted it would not compete in this league by shedding what
had been for it a successful, but peripheral, business.
The European breakfast cereals market is controlled by a few large
companies. According to the Food Industry Bulletin, Kellogg dominates with
more than 50 per cent, followed by Weetabix at 9.5 per cent and Cereal
Partners Worldwide, a joint venture between Nestle and General Mills, with 6
per cent.
The arrival of CP in 1989 is widely credited with setting off the real
explosion in the market. Within three years, through aggressive marketing
and new product launches, it had won sales of some Dollars 348m (Pounds
225m). Naturally, Kellogg fought back. When CP launched its Golden Grahams,
Kellogg came back a few weeks later with its own Golden Crackers. When CP
introduced Clusters, Kellogg responded with Nutfeast.
The battle even threatened a veteran campaigner, Tony the Tiger, of Frosties
fame. CP lit upon Huey, Dewey and Louie, Donald Duck's nephews, as the
cartoon warriors, for its Trio cereal in France.
But the biggest beneficiaries of the battle between the cereal giants appear
to have been the manufacturers of own label products. Own labels claim 11.5
per cent of total European cereal sales, second only to Kellogg. The
European market for private label products is widely acknowledged to be
growing at a faster rate than the branded sector.
It is partly due to the increasing number of adults who are turning to
cereal as a healthier breakfast option. In the UK, for example, the own
label market is largely an adult market, focusing on mueslis and bran
products.
'Staples deliver more steady virtues,' says Mr Mike Batten, marketing
manager of the UK private label manufacturer, Telford Foods. 'They may have
shown a dip in market share at times, but have stable volumes.' And with the
prospect of an ageing population, 'staples and bran are good bets for the
future'.
In the UK, own label sales are estimated to be outperforming the overall
breakfast cereal market's growth of 2 per cent a year.
'Private labels need size to compete,' says Ms Nomi Ghez, an analyst with
Goldman Sachs in the US. 'Who wants to fight for a share of a market which
only has sales of about Dollars 40m?'
But BolsWessanen, now with 50 per cent of the European private label market
and the financial muscle to back this up, could force Tony the Tiger, and
his rivals, Huey, Dewey and Louie, to sing even louder for their breakfasts.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Sainsbury makes second US foray: Purchase of Dollars 325m
stake in Giant Food sets stage for further expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J. Sainsbury, the UK's largest grocery retailer, is strengthening its
presence in the US by taking a Dollars 325m (Pounds 205m) stake in Giant
Food, the Washington DC-based supermarket chain.
The deal is Sainsbury's second foray into the US, after taking control of
the Shaw's supermarket chain in the north-eastern US in 1987. It gives the
UK retailer a strong position on the eastern seaboard, and a trading
presence in seven of the 10 wealthiest US states.
Giant, the 15th-largest US food retailer, has 107 stores in the Washington
DC metropolitan area, including surrounding counties in Maryland and
Virginia, and 42 in or around Baltimore, Maryland.
It dominates these local markets - with 44 per cent of the Washington DC
grocery market - and made a pre-tax profit of Dollars 151.8m last year on
sales of Dollars 3.57bn.
Sainsbury is acquiring 9.5m non-voting 'A' shares, giving it 16 per cent of
Giant's equity, and 125,000 'AL' voting shares. It will have 50 per cent of
voting rights and the right to elect three of Giant's seven board directors.
The total consideration is Dollars 325m in cash, funded from borrowings and
cash resources. The shares are being acquired from family members of the
late Mr Jac Lehrman, co-founder of Giant.
The remaining 50 per cent of voting shares are owned by the other co-founder
and chairman, Mr Israel Cohen, 82. Mr Cohen has no children involved in the
business, but Sainsbury would not comment on whether it had first refusal on
Mr Cohen's shares in the event of his death or a decision to sell.
'This is very much a first step,' said Mr David Sainsbury, chairman. 'We
will see how things develop. We regard the North American market as one of
the major areas of growth for the group in the future'.
Mr Cohen welcomed the deal, saying he looked forward to a 'productive
relationship'. Mr Sainsbury said he had long admired Giant, founded in 1935,
which had a very similar trading philosophy emphasising customer service and
value for money. The company's non-voting shares are traded on the American
Stock Exchange.
Giant plans to expand into the surrounding states of Delaware, Pennsylvania
and New Jersey, where it has identified 36 possible locations. It expects to
open at least six stores annually.
Mr Sainsbury said this would take it into states where Shaw's was also
planning to expand. He added there was much scope for joint buying between
the chains and Sainsbury in the UK, and for exchange of expertise in areas
such as distribution and systems.
After a slow start, Sainsbury has more than doubled operating profits in
Shaw's over the past seven years, through centralising distribution,
introducing 'value-added' services such as pharmacies, and increasing the
level of higher-margin own- label products to 25 per cent - compared with a
14 per cent average for US food retailers.
Mr Sainsbury said there was scope for similar initiatives at Giant, but
analysts warned that Sainsbury did not have overall control and would have
to treat the US chain's existing management with sensitivity.
Sainsbury is paying almost 22 times consensus prospective earnings of
Dollars 1.55 per share, a small premium to the US grocery retailing sector
which analysts suggested was justified by the opportunities provided by the
investment. Sainsbury's shares rose 2p to 402p in a falling market. While Mr
Sainsbury said the group was still examining expansion options in
continental Europe, yesterday's move suggests it sees the US as offering the
most attractive prospects.

FT  04 OCT 94 / IMF returns to 'business as usual' after row over reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The world's leading industria-lised countries yesterday launched a
determined effort to put behind them the weekend failure to agree on a
modest increase in the world's monetary reserves.
Adopting a 'business as usual' approach, ministers and central bank
governors underlined that Sunday's meeting of the International Monetary
Fund's policymaking interim committee had made progress towards bolstering
the IMF's capacity for helping countries in economic difficulty.
Officials said the committee's decision to press ahead with a temporary
boost to annual access limits, which determine how much economically
troubled countries may borrow from the fund in any given year, could prove a
big help to both Russia and Ukraine. These countries are planning to
negotiate standby credits with the IMF.
The interim committee has asked the IMF board to agree a formula that would
allow members to borrow an amount equivalent to at least 85 per cent of
their membership subscriptions in the fund against 68 per cent at present.
Many countries, including Britain, support access limits of 100 per cent.
The Group of Seven leading industrial nations and the developing country
members of the interim committee were unable to agree on an allocation of
the IMF's own reserve asset - known as special drawing rights - at their
meeting on Sunday.
The talks broke up acrimoniously with Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing
director, criticised by some industrial country representatives for failing
to back a G7 proposal for a selective SDR16bn (Pounds 14.9bn) allocation.
But yesterday, as delegations analysed the weekend events, hope grew that
there might be some resolution of the SDR dispute in the months ahead.
Mr Camdessus told the IMF and World Bank's joint development committee that
he continued 'to hope that in the not too distant future, agreement will be
reached' on a package comprising an SDR allocation and a strengthening of
the IMF's temporary systemic transformation facility which helps former
communist countries.

FT  04 OCT 94 / US move over Sinn Fein puts pressure on Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure mounted on Britain yesterday to clear the way for preliminary talks
with Sinn Fein early next year as the US began the process of normalising
relations with the IRA's political wing.
Mr Al Gore, the vice-president, informed Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein
president, in a telephone call that the US was lifting its ban on official
contacts with Sinn Fein representatives.
A senior administration official said this was 'the beginning of a
relationship with Sinn Fein, a party with whom we've had no official
contacts for 25 years'.
Mr Gore's telephone call appeared designed to raise contacts with Mr Adams
to the highest level possible without offending the British government by a
meeting at the White House.
Although Mr Adams has been pressing for a more conspicuous meeting with
President Bill Clinton or Mr Gore, officials said he had not made any formal
request for such a meeting.
Downing Street's response to the telephone call was low key, with officials
emphasising that 'the Americans have got to decide for themselves' how they
receive Mr Adams.
But moderate unionists complained that the move was improper and premature.
'They would have been wiser to wait until Sinn Fein became a normal
political party,' said Rev Martin Smyth, the Ulster Unionist MP for South
Belfast.
Yesterday's move came as Mr Adams prepared for a high-profile television
debate with Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist security spokesman.
The British government is analysing with great care remarks made by the Sinn
Fein president during his second visit to the US this year.
London has promised to begin dialogue on how to admit Sinn Fein to political
talks on Northern Ireland's future within three months of a permanent end to
IRA violence
It is still not convinced that the month-old ceasefire is for good. But
senior officials said yesterday that every day which passed 'without
violence, without killing' gave grounds for optimism.
A first meeting will take place today at the State Department between Mr
Adams and Mr John Kornblum, deputy assistant secretary of state for European
affairs. Mr Kornblum will be joined by Mr Leon Fuerth, national security
adviser to Mr Gore.
In a letter to Mr Adams confirming today's meeting, Mr Anthony Lake, Mr
Clinton's principal national security adviser, said the Sinn Fein leader's
'role in bringing about the IRA ceasefire was a courageous step forward for
peace'.

FT  04 OCT 94 / UK banks charge most for EU money transfers: Payment times
fail to meet voluntary targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

British banks charge the most for transferring money across European
borders, but complete the payments faster than any of their European Union
counterparts, a survey from the European Commission said yesterday.
The survey also shows it costs more and takes longer to transfer money
between member states in the EU than it did a year ago. The performance of
EU banks falls well short of voluntary targets on the expense and speed of
cross-border payments set by Brussels 10 months ago.
The research is likely to lead to legislation from the Commission. Such a
move would cheer consumer groups and small businesses that for years have
condemned bank service quality.
According to the report, Europe's businesses and consumers pay an average
Ecu25.4 (Pounds 20) per Ecu100 cross-border payment, Ecu2 more than they
paid a year ago. The average total time for a transaction is almost five
working days, with averages in the member states ranging from three to eight
working days.
UK banks charge the most for sending a payment, followed by France and
Portugal. Charges are lowest in the Netherlands, Spain and Luxembourg. Banks
in Greece charge the most for exchanging foreign currency, and the UK and
Belgium the second-most. Overall, costs are highest in France, the UK and
Greece, and lowest in Italy, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.
The British Bankers' Association said it was disappointed that the survey
was carried out so quickly after the initial survey a year ago. It said:
'This did not leave time for in-depth analysis.'
The survey targeted 352 bank branches, carrying out 1,000 urgent money
transfers and more than 100 non-urgent transfers. On average, it cost less
to send a non-urgent transfer, and those were carried out more quickly.
Banks in Portugal, Ireland and Italy were the slowest to send, while banks
in Spain, Luxembourg and again Portugal, the slowest to receive. Service was
most efficient in the UK.
The banks were ordered to charge the sender all the costs for the
cross-border payments so that the beneficiary would get the full amount. But
charging at both ends occurred in 36 per cent of the urgent transfers.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Food price war hots up as study warns over sales growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two supermarket chains joined the latest skirmish in the food price wars
yesterday as a report from Verdict, the research group, said retailers faced
a disappointing Christmas and years of slow retail growth.
Safeway, the superstore chain owned by Argyll, the UK's third-largest food
retailing group, launched a Pounds 7m advertising campaign called Lightening
the Load to highlight 'value-added' aspects of its stores such as
bag-packing and carry-out services, wide aisles, baby-changing facilities,
and its refund and replace guarantee scheme.
The campaign is designed to support Safeway's new Price Watch initiative - a
guarantee to customers that they can buy products at prices competitive with
those of rivals such as Sainsbury and Tesco. Independent pricing research
suggests that customers see Safeways as expensive.
Shares in Argyll fell 5p to 270p, and Asda shares closed down 3 1/4 p at 62
1/4 p. Shares in Sainsbury, however, rose 2p to 402p on news of its Pounds
205m investment in the US supermarket chain Giant Food.
Last month, Safeway introduced a range of 100 basic own-label goods at low
prices, called Safeway Savers - similar to the Value range launched last
year by Tesco, the UK's second-largest food retailer.
Also yesterday, Asda, the fourth-largest grocery retailer, announced a No
Nonsense price freeze on 7,000 grocery and non-food items until at least
January.
Fierce price competition between supermarkets shows little sign of abating.
It began almost 18 months ago with the Price Check campaign launched by
Gateway - renamed Somerfield - in response to the spread of discount
retailers and the increasing saturation of the grocery market. Shoprite, the
discount retailer which operates mainly in Scotland, yesterday issued its
second profits warning in four months.
In its annual four-year retailing forecast, Verdict says that price
competition will remain 'intense' between food retailers for the foreseeable
future.
It also warns that retail trading will 'get worse before it gets better',
with consumer demand now slowing as a result of higher taxes and the rise in
interest rates. These are likely to make Christmas 'disappointing', with
slower growth than last year.
The report also forecasts that annual retail sales growth will remain below
the almost 6 per cent recorded in 1993.

FT  04 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Short selling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
City regulators are working themselves into a tizzy over alleged market
manipulation through short selling in the run-up to secondary share issues.
The Securities and Investments Board has already sounded off on the subject.
Now the Stock Exchange has published a consultative document outlining ways
in which regulations covering short selling could be tightened. The aim
would be to prevent investors artificially depressing a stock's price and
then covering their positions by buying shares in an offering.
The regulators are putting the cart before the horse. Before suggesting more
regulations, they first need to establish whether any abuse is taking place.
Certainly, there are cases of share prices falling in the run-up to issues
such as the second tranche of BT and Wellcome. But this may merely be a
natural adjustment to the fact that the market is having to absorb more
stock.
Regulators should also remember that issuers are adept at finding ways of
supporting share prices during an offer period. Not only does a vast array
of advisers mean discordant voices are often hard to find; issuers are able
to refuse stock to investors who sell shares in the offer period.
Some of the rules suggested could have the effect of so tilting the playing
field that share prices were artificially inflated. A wise regulator would
tread warily before taking sides. The best reason for intervening would be
to ensure greater transparency in share dealing. Beyond that, regulation is
likely to become so heavy-handed that it stifles financial innovation.

FT  04 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Hoechst
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hoechst's restructuring represents a cultural revolution at the world's
largest chemicals group. The intention is to internationalise and make the
company more dynamic and profit-orientated. The number of divisions has been
slashed from 15 to seven. Each will be responsible for its own
profitability, offering freedom from Frankfurt's bureaucratic bungling. The
new management is younger and more international. For the first time, an
American is on the board.
Hoechst's new-found dynamism is to be welcomed, especially given its
previous torpor. Since 1990, operating profits have fallen more than 53 per
cent, the return on assets from 11.8 per cent to 5.3 per cent. Over the same
period, Bayer slashed 19,100 employees from its pay-roll. Hoechst's total
edged down by just 407, although the figure does include recent
consolidation of overseas subsidiaries. Not surprisingly, the company has
underperformed the DAX by 35 per cent since 1988.
The biggest headache remains the drugs division - a decade ago the world's
largest pharmaceuticals business, but now sixth. The portfolio is fragmented
and old. More than 75 per cent of its drugs date from before 1974.
Pre-research and development margins are only 24 per cent, compared with an
industry average of 40 per cent. The challenge before the new management is
huge. The new team may look dynamic, but it must prove it knows the
difference between activity and productivity.

FT  04 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: J Sainsbury
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
J Sainsbury's acquisition of a stake in Giant Food is consistent with the
strategy of careful diversification away from UK food retailing which began
nearly 20 years ago. By acquiring 50 per cent of the voting rights in the
Washington-based Giant and just 16 per cent of its equity, Sainsbury has
capped potential risks while paving the way to take full control in due
course.
Giant will make a good fit with Shaw's, the New England food retailer which
became a full subsidiary in 1987. Combined, the two companies will have
turnover of Dollars 6bn and a strong position in seven out of 10 of the US's
most prosperous states. There is scope for geographical expansion and
possible synergies on the buying front and systems development.
The scope for rationalisation is however limited: at 4.8 per cent Giant's
operating margins are lower than those Sainsbury achieves in the UK but are
significantly better than Shaw's. The full benefits will only come when
Sainsbury has full management control. The sooner this takes place, the
better. It took five years for Shaw's to become a 100 per cent subsidiary.
This delay arguably contributed to its poor earnings performance.
In the short term, the deal will not contribute materially to earnings. Nor
does it answer the big strategic question of how Sainsbury can maintain
earnings growth when UK food retailing is stagnating. A really significant
diversification will require Sainsbury to abandon its usual caution.

FT  04 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Warburg stumbles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg could have done without more bad publicity after its embarrassing
spat with Swiss Bank Corporation over the Enterprise bid for Lasmo. It has
given scant detail of what appears to be a slump in its trading income this
year. Yet it would be wrong to assume that this fresh disappointment implies
a misguided strategy. If there are flaws, they have more to do with
implementation.
Warburg has laid itself open to the charge of complacency in two areas. With
its market-making and proprietary trading activities, it aimed to enhance
its profitability by focusing on the revenue line. But costs matter too, and
those at Warburg are high: average staff costs per employee last year were
Pounds 105,000 compared with only Pounds 81,000 at Kleinwort Benson. Second,
market-making is a mug's game in weak markets, but the risks can be reduced
by judicious use of derivatives, an expertise which Warburg has been slow to
develop.
Had management paid more attention to these points, its strategy might now
escape scrutiny. After all most investors seemed happy to accept the notion
that global aspirations were natural for a bank of Warburg's size.
Securitisation of financial markets is creating more business for investment
banks, so Warburg is in a growth industry.
The snag, as yesterday's announcement showed, is that this means greater
focus on trading with all its inherent risks. For a bank like Warburg, the
price of ambition is a fall in the quality of earnings.

Anyone earning over Pounds 60,000 is in that category and faces the

Football talent scouts must already be booking their flights for Buenos
Aires. The goalkeeper of Argentine championship leaders Velez Sarsfield -
Jose Luis Chilavert - is making something of a name for himself . . . as a
goal-scorer.
At the weekend Chilavert, an international player for Paraguay, scored a
last minute goal with a 25-metre free kick, giving his team a 1-0 victory
over Deportivo Espanol.
Chilavert begged to be allowed to take the kick, much to the obvious
grumpiness of team captain Roberto Trotta. Trotta only gave in when
Chilavert refused to return to his goal. Chilavert's team-mates went wild
when he scored; Trotta did not join in. Sour grapes or what?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ructions within the City's Court of Aldermen last week suggest that the
principle of Buggins' Turn is starting to go out of fashion as a means of
producing Lord Mayors.
Not only has alderman Neil Young resigned, but it is understood that two
other names will not 'go forward'. Bryan Toye, chairman of Toye &amp; Co, a
company making civil and military regalia, seems to want to slide down the
list a bit and Tony Bull, a partner in surveyors Walter Bull, who when
elected 10 years ago was initially vetoed by his fellow aldermen, has also
heard his name will not now go forward.
Meanwhile, Old Etonian Young's departure has sparked the re-emergence of a
rather unlikely ally in the form of Dennis Delderfield, a liveryman who
edits a rag called the City of London &amp; Docklands Times and who used to be
on the Court of Common Council until he was declared bankrupt two years ago.
He would like aldermen elected every four years  - at present, once elected,
they can hang on until they are 70.
The Corporation of London knows him only too well. He played a big part in
orchestrating the Smithfield meat traders' (largely successful) battle over
funding of their market. His grasp of the arcane world of City politics
seems to be as keen as his tongue is vicious. Dennis the Menace has found
another cause.

If Ms Pasternak gets upset at the reviews of her work, she should spare a

taking the New York Times all the way to to the US Supreme Court because the
paper's reviewer had rubbished his book, Interference: how organized crime
influences professional football.
The review, written by Times sportswriter Gerald Eskenazi, concluded that
there was 'too much sloppy journalism to trust the bulk of this book's 512
pages'. The Supreme Court agreed and has thrown out Moldea's Dollars 10m
lawsuit on the grounds that the NYT review was 'a supportable interpretation
of the author's work'.
Sloppy journalism as a defence against libel? That's a new one.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
She was 'a frail bird, whose wings had been torn apart' and he was a
'skilled, adventurous lover' who didn't know the meaning of bulimia. Welcome
to Princess in Love, Anna Pasternak's account of the romance between the
Princess of Wales and Captain James Hewitt.
The book has the unique virtue of having 'sickened' Dame Barbara Cartland,
outraged the unshockable publicist Max Clifford, and caught virtually every
British tabloid editor on the hop.
Indeed, one wonders whether the dirty tricks department at Tory central
office might have had a hand in it to divert the spotlight from Labour's
Tony Blair love-fest.
But back to Ms Pasternak, great-niece of the Dr Zhivago writer. She even
obliges with a cut-out-and-keep guide to the qualities needed if you want to
get sybaritic with a princess of your choice: 'The languid arrogant walk,
the right shoes, the laid-back drawl; and the nonchalance to sail through
any social situation.'
What she cannot provide is any indication of how to make true love last,
although there are tips on what to do when things go sour (listen to
Pavarotti, go and fight in the Gulf war, hold your head in your hands for a
few moments and contact a publisher).
The only possible way of making this ludicrous book at all readable is to
substitute the words 'monstrously lucrative' for the word 'special'
throughout, as in the author's note: 'It seemed to me that the love that
Princess Diana had shared with another man was too special to remain
secret.'

FT  04 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Wrong turn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Slovakia is at a crossroads, and at the weekend voters steered their country
down the wrong path. Offered politicians who promised market reforms and
liberal treatment of Slovakia's ethnic minorities, the electorate instead
endorsed the anti-reform platform of former prime minister Vladimir Meciar,
who is now likely to return to office in coalition with more extreme
nationalist allies.
Unlike the former communists now ruling Poland and Hungary, Mr Meciar and
his coalition partners have the potential and perhaps the will to turn
Slovakia off the road of economic reforms and political tolerance.
The election results are bad news not just for Slovakia, but for the rest of
central Europe. Bratislava's next government could exacerbate ethnic
tensions elsewhere in the region and provide an excuse for west European
lobbies seeking to impede central Europe's access to the EU.
Mr Meciar's promise to freeze Slovakia's fledgling privatisation programme
is the worst economic omen. Czechoslovakia's velvet divorce bequeathed to
Bratislava the lion's share of rust-belt industries. The obvious difficulty
of reforming these industries probably explains why Slovak voters lost their
nerve at the weekend. But such reforms are vital if their country is to
compete with its increasingly prosperous neighbours. Mr Meciar may find it
difficult to deliver his promised moratorium on privatisation - nearly 1m
Slovaks have already bought privatisation vouchers and factories have
already been earmarked for sell-off. But foreign investors who had shown
interest in Slovakia will be discouraged.
More worrying for the rest of Europe is the fact that the symbiotic
relationship in Slovakia between economic stagnation and extreme nationalism
is likely to grow stronger. The fear of painful economic transition which
pushed Slovaks into Mr Meciar's arms also rewarded extreme nationalists with
a surprisingly high 5.6 per cent of the vote. Under its new leaders,
Bratislava is likely to step up discrimination against the country's
560,000-strong ethnic Hungarian minority, a prospect which understandably
disturbs neighbouring Hungary.
There is still hope that, as Mr Meciar confronts the tricky task of forming
a coalition government and the even greater challenge of reviving Slovakia's
economy, he, like former communist leaders in Hungary, will embrace market
reforms and set aside ethnic quarrels.
As for western European countries, they should not rush to punish Mr Meciar:
that would only push Slovakia further into its self-imposed isolation. But
they should assure Slovakia's neighbours, particularly Hungary, that pursuit
of more enlightened ethnic policies will be recognised and rewarded, and
insist that Slovakia will not be allowed to hold up its more reform-minded
neighbours' progress towards EU membership.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Mind the quality: UK consumers may be willing to pay more,
but they are also more cynical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Land Rover unveils its new-generation luxury Range Rover, while Jaguar
invests heavily in a new range of luxury saloons. At the same time, Louis
Vuitton rations its customers to one of its prestige handbags each, and
supermarkets fill their freezer cabinets with Haagen-Dazs and other
expensive 'adult' ice creams.
These are all signs that manufacturers believe that, now the recession is
over, demand for premium-priced products will mount.
Their confidence, according to the Henley Centre, the forecasting
specialist, is not misplaced. However, they cannot relax completely: Henley
also reveals the emergence of the 'cynical consumer', who is wise to
marketing ploys and in relentless pursuit of value for money.
For the time being, consumers in the UK seem willing, once again, to seek
out and pay for quality, according to Henley's annual consumer attitudes
survey* of 2,000 adults in Britain, published this week. This should cheer
up the owners of big-name consumer brands, which have seen their margins
eroded by cut-price and own-label rivals.
The responses to one question - 'Do you agree that highest price usually
means you get the highest quality?' - show how attitudes have changed. 'In
the boom years between 1985 and 1989, there was a strengthening association
between high price and high quality,' says Henley. 'Then, as the recession
bit, this association weakened.
'A low point was reached in either 1991 or 1993, depending on the market,
but since then a recovery has taken place such that in most . . . markets,
the strength of the association has reached, or surpassed, the levels of
1989.'
This sounds like good news for manufacturers. Less encouraging, however, is
what appears to be a contradictory finding in the report. When asked whether
they agreed with the statement 'When shopping always look for the cheapest
items', 35 per cent of Henley's sample said yes this year - up from 32 per
cent in 1993 and 29 per cent in 1989 - and Henley forecasts this price
pressure will continue.
Henley says the two findings are not inconsistent. Consumers are prepared to
pay a premium for quality - what is at issue is the size of that premium. In
the past, some brand owners 'allowed unsustainable price differentials to
develop to the point at which the consumer (prompted by recession)
revolted', it says. The lesson is that price premiums can be charged, but
their size needs to be monitored by manufacturers alongside quality.
Not everyone agrees with Henley that consumers' increased awareness and
insistence on value for money are here to stay. Winston Fletcher, chairman
of the Advertising Association, which represents both brand owners and
advertising agencies, is sceptical.
'The changes may be more temporary than many now think. There is always a
tendency to overestimate the significance of contemporary moods. It will all
depend on whether the economy continues to be buoyant for any length of
time.' Three to five years of growth would see consumers giving a lower
priority to price, in his view.
For the present, however, consumers are demanding quality and value - as
well as higher standards of service and wider choice. Henley's data suggest
that, even in the depths of the recession, pressures on manufacturers and
retailers to provide better service and choice continued to grow.
Archie Norman, chief executive of Asda, the retail group, agrees: 'We've had
an explosion in consumer choice. Customers have been shopping around and
they're aware of the differences.
'That doesn't just mean they're more price conscious - they're more value
conscious. I think that is a permanent change. They'll pay a premium for
better value, but they won't pay a premium for nothing extra.'
In the past, brand owners' strategy for attracting consumers to expensive
goods was to throw money at an advertising agency. Henley suggests this may
no longer be so successful, owing to the emergence of what it terms the
'cynical consumer', who is sceptical about advertising claims and 'unwilling
to accept the messages of the marketing community at face value'.
Those born since the war have grown up surrounded by mass-media advertising
and can spot overblown claims and the hard sell. Experience means they know,
says Henley, that 'the real message of all advertisers is, crudely put, 'we
want your money' '.
Fletcher, of the Advertising Association, says: 'People understand the wiles
of the advertiser very well. The average 35-year-old has seen 150,000
different commercials and seen most of them more than six times. It has been
shown that infants can differentiate between commercials and programmes from
the age of about three onwards.'
Overall, the message to brand owners is that, as Henley says, consumers will
retain 'a willingness constantly to reappraise the price-quality equation'.
In spite of economic recovery and a reviving interest in high quality, the
'cynical consumer' is likely be a fixture for some years to come.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Leading Article: SDR wars in Madrid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When an essentially innocuous proposal to raise international liquidity
promotes a near-brawl among the world's most influential economic leaders,
something is clearly amiss. The representatives of the Group of Seven
industrial countries and the managing director of the International Monetary
Fund clashed over the issue on Sunday, mainly because each had an
exaggerated sense of what was at stake. Their inability to resolve their
differences is regrettable, not merely for developing countries which would
have benefited from Mr Michel Camdessus's proposal, but for the G7's ability
to adapt to the fact that it is no longer the only game in town.
Mr Camdessus's proposal for a new allocation of special drawing rights - the
IMF's reserve currency - has been around for some years. Justifying such an
injection of liquidity into the global financial system means answering two
potential doubts: first, about whether it is strictly needed; and second,
whether it will be globally inflationary.
Mr Camdessus claims that a low level of reserves is putting unnecessarily
harsh constraints on the import capacity of some developing and
post-Communist countries. Many developing countries now have access to
alternative, private sources of financing; the case for supplementing these
with IMF resources would appear to be quite weak. But Mr Camdessus is
correct to point out that not all countries are so fortunate, and may need
further emergency assistance from the fund.
Providing transitional help to developing countries in macroeconomic
distress is one of the least controversial aspects of the IMF's role in the
world. Such countries might be supported by other means - by enhancing the
fund's resources for making structural adjustment loans, for example. But
the managing director clearly believed that a proposal which did not require
individual members to contribute the extra funds directly would have more
chance of success.
Neither Mr Camdessus's proposal nor the compromise agreed over the weekend
among the G7 countries themselves was an optimal solution to the problem he
identifies.
But neither in itself was likely to prove highly inflationary either. The
sums involved were simply too small. In truth, Sunday's stand-off in Madrid
owed less to this concern than to the fact that issues of much greater
importance were thought to be at stake: namely, the existence of a global
'capital shortage' and the future role of the IMF.
The fear that rising investment demand is putting upward pressure on global
real interest rates is unlikely to go away. But just as the future course of
global inflation will not be altered by a phased Dollars 23bn increase in
SDRs, nor will such an injection alter the fact that net saving rates in
Europe and elsewhere are currently too low. Mr Camdessus and the G7
representatives did themselves a disservice by appearing to suggest it could
do either.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Spanner in the Rolls-Royce engine: Peter Norman explains the
arcane issue that has caused a split between the IMF and its principal
shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund,
has pulled off a remarkable feat.
He has elevated the special drawing right (SDR), the IMF's own reserve
asset, from almost total obscurity into the stuff of headlines.
On Sunday, the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee failed to agree a
modest increase to the world's currency reserves, prompting acrimony over Mr
Camdessus's role in pursuing the issue. There was concern among the Group of
Seven leading industrial countries that the IMF managing director had found
himself at odds with his principal shareholders, including Mr Lloyd Bentsen,
the US Treasury secretary.
While the clash will not have any significant effect on the fortunes of the
global economy, it raises questions about the future authority of the Fund
and Mr Camdessus's position as its head in his remaining two years and four
months of office.
The issue about which so much heat has been generated is arcane, even by the
standards of international monetary diplomacy.
The SDR is an artificial currency unit, a composite of the dollar, D-Mark,
yen, French franc and sterling which is at present worth about Dollars 1.47.
SDRs were first created in the late 1960s after years of growing concern
over a perceived shortage of international liquidity, but now just account
for little more than 2 per cent of non-gold reserves.
For some years, Mr Camdessus, backed by the developing countries, has been
pushing for a general allocation of SDRs to be distributed among the IMF's
179 members. Before the current IMF meeting, he proposed a 36bn SDR
allocation. This stance was backed by the developing countries, some of
which put forward similar plans.
Under the IMF statutes, a general allocation is permissible, provided there
is a 'global need' for such reserves and provided it wins the support of 85
per cent of the IMF's members' votes in the Fund board.
To demonstrate global need, Mr Camdessus pointed to an anticipated expansion
of demand for non-gold reserves of all IMF member countries of about 400bn
SDRs over the next five years. He said 55 per cent of all countries and 67
per cent of the former communist states 'in transition' have international
reserves equivalent to less than 12 weeks of imports.
Mr Camdessus's proposed allocation would meet about 9 per cent of the
forecast expansion in demand for reserves. This would be modest in relation
to the size of the world economy, but Mr Camdessus has pursued his case with
extraordinary passion. He genuinely believes the SDR should live up to the
plans of its inventors and become a central part of the international
monetary system. To achieve this, he believes a boost in its reserve role
from the current low level is crucial.
Germany, together with the US, UK and other members of the G7, have long
argued against such money creation by the IMF, declaring it to be
unnecessary, potentially inflationary and creating a dangerous precedent. Mr
Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, insisted that with today's large
international capital markets there was no 'global need' for new reserves.
However, Germany and the other big industrialised countries recognised that
the 37 countries that had joined the IMF since the last issue of SDRs in
1981 were victims of an injustice. These countries, many of them former
communist states, had no SDRs in their reserves.
Germany was therefore prepared to back a compromise proposal put forward by
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, and Mr Bentsen for a special
allocation of 16bn SDRs. This would benefit all IMF members, but the
newcomers and certain poor developing countries in particular.
However, it would necessitate a change in the IMF statutes involving
parliamentary ratification in most member states, in addition to requiring
an 85 per cent majority of the IMF's votes. These hurdles, the Germans felt,
were high enough to dispel any idea that the IMF could become a
money-creating machine.
The UK-US compromise on the SDR was presented in a package together with
plans to raise the annual access limits to the IMF's normal loan facilities
for countries in economic difficulty. Also envisaged was a boost to the
systemic transformation facility (STF), which the IMF has set up as a
temporary source of support for former communist countries.
UK officials always said it would be difficult to secure agreement for the
package. But hopes rose on Saturday because the G7, representing about 45
per cent of the IMF's votes, gave it unanimous backing. The agreement of
France was seen as especially significant and raised hopes that Mr
Camdessus, a former director of the French Treasury and central bank
governor, would fall into line with his compatriots.
Instead, Mr Camdessus stuck with his proposal and carried the developing
countries with him, with the support of Mr Manmohan Singh, the influential
Indian finance minister, who headed a G9 group of developing country
representatives in the Interim Committee.
It was clear on Sunday that neither the UK-US nor the Camdessus proposals
could command the necessary 85 per cent majorities. The proposed
strengthening of the STF failed for the same reason. However, agreement was
reached that the access limits to loan facilities should be raised from 68
per cent to 'at least 85 per cent of quota' or membership rights.
Some poorer IMF members will be the losers from Sunday's events. British
officials estimated that the UK-US plan would have boosted Russia's reserves
by about Dollars 1.47bn and those of the entire former Soviet Union by
Dollars 2.35bn. Low-income developing countries stood to gain Dollars 2.49bn
and lower middle income countries Dollars 4.55bn.
With hindsight, some G7 ministers admitted it was bad tactics to publicise
their accord on the UK-US plan. This gave the impression that they were
giving the IMF membership a 'take it or leave it' offer.
But they also believe that Mr Camdessus made a bad mistake in thinking that
he could break the unity of the G7. One participant observed that he had
ignored advance warnings that the biggest IMF shareholders would not support
a general allocation. By pushing his plan in the meeting, he forced them to
choose between their own club and the IMF managing director: they opted for
the G7.
Mr Camdessus's performance is seen by G7 officials as an extraordinary lapse
by a man regarded as a skilled operator and, until now, as a very able
managing director of the IMF. It has also raised questions about the role of
the IMF managing director. Was he right to lead the charge for the
developing countries or should he have campaigned for the compromise backed
by his biggest members? Should he behave like a politician or an official?
After Sunday's meeting, an unrepentant Mr Camdessus insisted he had a right
to promote policies of his own and vigorously back them, even if they ran
counter to the ideas of the biggest IMF members.
Yesterday, ministers attending the IMF meeting were involved in a
damage-control exercise, cultivating a 'business as usual' air. The talk was
of new discussions at the IMF's next spring meetings, perhaps even a special
Interim Committee gathering on the question.
But the weekend row has cast a cloud over the IMF in this its 50th
anniversary year.
Mr Camdessus's stand may eventually be validated by the great sweep of
history, as the industrialised countries lose economic clout to the
so-called developing world. But by battling with his principal shareholders,
and the US in particular, the IMF managing director has thrown a spanner in
the works of what has always been seen as the Rolls-Royce of the
international financial institutions.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe has been better at spawning regulations on the ownership of
television channels than it has at encouraging new services. The latest
debate - over ownership of digital satellite stations - shows signs of
perpetuating the confusions of the past.
Last week, British terrestrial broadcasters voted against proposals for a
new code of conduct put forward in Geneva by the steering board of the
European digital video project. The group, which brings together 145
organisations, is attempting to set standards for digital television, which
could eventually deliver many more channels than conventional analogue
signals. Although a majority of members adopted the code, the row is
unlikely to die away.
The UK broadcasters' concern is that the code will permit a high degree of
vertical integration which could stifle new channels. In particular, they
fear that one organisation could own the encryption or 'scrambling' system
for delivering programmes, as well as owning the programmes. In controlling
the means of delivery - in acting as 'gatekeeper', in the industry's phrase
 -a company might prevent others gaining access to audiences unless they
paid an exorbitant toll fee.
Many are sceptical of the potential of digital television. But the issue has
gained heat partly because of the success of satellite channels, delivered
by conventional analogue signals, which gain some of their revenue from
subscription. These include BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial
Times, has a stake, as well as Canal Plus in France and Filmnet in the
Benelux countries. These channels have demonstrated that where audiences are
small, subscription rather than advertising may be an essential source of
revenue. They also show that the first company to set up a means of
encrypting programmes and then collecting subscription revenues has a
natural monopoly.
UK terrestrial broadcasters have been slow to appreciate the power of such
combinations; they made little mention of the issue in their comments on the
1990 Broadcasting Act. But their attempts to prevent the same pattern
emerging in digital television are misguided. They give little weight to the
argument that the company which bore the initial risk of backing one
delivery system should get some reward. Moreover, new systems are emerging
to break the subscription monopoly, notably cable.
Vertical integration in satellite television provides a powerful market
position, which is capable of being abused. But there are better solutions
than banning particular configurations. In particular, companies should
press for more information about the gatekeeper's terms for allowing access
to the subscriber base, and to report abuses promptly to regulators. They
should avoid, though, pressing for rules which threaten to add another
ill-thought out layer to one of the trickiest areas of European competition
policy.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: No need for this ignorance of
European institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A. J. BIRCHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It was ironic that Robert Rice should refer ('Cost of Ignorance',
September 30) to the regular confusion between the European Community's
Court of Justice and the Council of Europe's Court of Human Rights, when the
previous day your front page article, 'Pensions ruling will put costs on
employers', referred to the decision of the former, as '. . . part of a
series of judgments in Strasbourg . . .'
The institutions of the European Community are highly active and there is an
enormous amount of information available about those activities. There is no
reason for confusion or that any of them should be 'shadowy' bodies. News
coverage, however, can often be poor, even from the most reliable of
sources.
Robert Rice was writing about the recent human rights reference, arising out
of the Guinness affair. Various reports about that, on TV and in the
newspapers, wrongly attributed it to the EU, the EC and the European Court
of Justice. On the day, recently, that the proposed paternity-leave
legislation was under discussion in Brussels, a radio news report
conjectured that if a compromise could not be agreed with the UK, then under
the Social Chapter, the other 11 states, might go it alone]
Robert Rice is correct about the European Court of Justice. It and the other
Community institutions do enjoy considerable 'power . . . over business' as
well as other aspects of our lives. But as long as significant media comment
directs our attention to matters such as the European Commission's
interference, with our inalienable right to regulate for ourselves, the size
and shape of our courgettes and bananas, I fear that we shall continue to
pay the 'cost of ignorance'.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Poll where parties count for nothing: The Peruvian
president's campaign for re-election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Alberto Fujimori of Peru is expected to declare within a few days
his candidacy in next year's presidential elections.
His chances of a second term look good. Mr Fujimori - who in 1990 took over
a country devastated by economic mismanagement and terrorism - now heads the
fastest-growing economy in Latin America.
Growth is expected to reach 9 per cent this year. Annual inflation is likely
to fall below 20 per cent, from 7,500 per cent in 1990. The guerrilla
movements which then seemed on the verge of taking over the state now look
broken.
With this record behind him, Mr Fujimori is popular: polls suggest that 65
per cent of Peruvians think he is doing a good job. He is also popular among
businessmen - privatisation is moving ahead and the economy, including its
mining sector, has been thrown open to foreign investment.
Closer to home, things are trickier. He is so unpopular with his estranged
wife, Ms Susana Higuchi, that she is threatening to sabotage her husband's
expected attempt at re-election in next April's elections. Alleging
widespread corruption in the Fujimori regime, she has decided to run for
president too.
Backed by a newly-created 'Harmony Twenty-First Century' movement, she must
first win a ruling from a constitutional court to overturn a legal bar -
created by the Fujimori-dominated Congress - that bans relatives of the head
of state from standing for the presidency.
She is just one of the challengers to Mr Fujimori, who has changed the
constitution to allow for his re-election.
Last month, the 74-year-old former UN secretary-general, Mr Javier Perez de
Cuellar, announced his intention to seek office. Mr Alejandro Toledo, a
respected economist, is also running as head of a new 'independent movement
of professionals and technocrats', calling itself 'Peru Possible'. With a
host of lesser-known figures, there are already 15 declared candidates, and
by the October 11 deadline there could be as many as 24 presidential
hopefuls.
Mr Perez de Cuellar and Mr Toledo have both spent many years outside Peru,
the former as a career diplomat, the latter as a consultant and visiting
professor at eminent universities. Ms Higuchi is an engineer who founded and
ran a successful construction company, until becoming first lady.
All three have features in common: none has any experience of government and
none is associated with any political party. They even steer clear of the
word 'party' in describing the groups that support them.
Lack of political experience is almost a sine qua non for electoral success
in today's Peru. The biggest drawback is to be dubbed a 'traditional
politician'. It was such politicians who, culminating in the 1985-1990
presidency of Mr Alan Garcia, succeeded in bringing hyperinflation,
corruption and terrorism.
Political party structures have been hierarchical and unresponsive to
popular needs. Now the parties are making efforts to polish their image  -
consulting members over candidacies, bringing in younger faces and co-opting
women to their male-dominated organisations. But their standing remains low.
Four out of five Peruvians describe themselves as independents with no party
allegiance.
This development has been encouraged by Mr Fujimori. He came from nowhere to
win the 1990 elections over the leading candidate - author Mario Vargas
Llosa - who had allied himself with the political parties thinking such a
move would secure him support.
Since then, through skilful manipulation - largely via well-managed
revelations of earlier scandals - Mr Fujimori has ensured that the
reputations of the traditional parties have remained low, while enhancing
his own image and that of his military backers.
Reluctant to transform his own makeshift political alliance into an
organised party, Mr Fujimori has preferred to emphasise the direct link
between president and people. He spends much of his time travelling the
country, fostering the impression that he is the source of state
munificence. He has eschewed ideology, and made a virtue out of pragmatism,
or - as he would say - 'deeds not words'.
He has outmanoeuvred his political opponents. In April 1992, with the
backing of the army, he suspended congress and the constitution. Two of the
main parties refused to take part in the congress that he then set up with
the main task of agreeing a new constitution, leaving him a majority which
passes any law he sends before it.
Mr Fujimori, a self-confessed authoritarian, has also concentrated power in
Lima. Grass-roots movements, whether of peasants, workers or shanty-town
dwellers, have seen their influence eroded; in country areas recently
reclaimed from the guerrillas, Mr Fujimori's military allies have replaced
elected civilian governors.
This, argue his opponents, is unhealthy in a country where there is little
history of democracy. It has undermined the country's political and judicial
institutions, they say, leaving Peru, with all its ethnic and economic
divisions, as far away as ever from becoming a cohesive nation. For these
reasons, Mr Fujimori's achievements remain superficial, they believe,
offering room for successful opposition.
Mr Perez de Cuellar said, when launching his candidacy, that going through
Peru he found 'vast areas of poverty and systematic ill-treatment of
institutions'. He would perfect 'what had already been achieved', but with
'democracy, genuine stability, development and jobs'.
From Mr Toledo, the opening campaign message was: 'Changes and achievements
need to be institutionalised. It is extremely dangerous to leave the country
in the hands of one person, however capable he may be.'
The need for mature institutions and political parties and a
decentralisation of power may well be pressing. But matched against Mr
Fujimori's successes on the economy and against terrorism, it may prove hard
to turn that into a campaign slogan.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Lift veil to reveal insider dealers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANTHONY WOODWARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In common with similar inquiries, the investigation into insider
dealing in Consgold shares ran into the inevitable brick wall that it is not
always possible to identify the ultimate beneficiary of the organisation
buying the shares ('S African leak in Consgold bid run-up - DTI says
majority of dealings in call options were 'wholly abnormal' ', September
30).
There seems to be a simple solution to this: make it a requirement upon all
intermediaries through which financial instruments are bought/sold that they
can only do so if they are aware of the true owner of the investment and
that they are empowered to reveal his identity, if required. There is a
reasonable parallel to this approach in the procedures which now have to be
undertaken by banks in order to prevent money laundering.
If the veil of secrecy could be lifted from all shareholdings, the incidence
of insider dealing would fall dramatically.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J N STEVENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We feel let down by the Accounting Standards Board. It allowed its
sub-committee, the urgent issues taskforce, to judge whether companies are
justified in not obeying the law when reporting total boardroom pay
('Guidelines on directors' option schemes issued', September 29). The
taskforce has concluded that it is not practicable to include in estimated
boardroom emoluments a 'meaningful' money value for directors' share
options. Its published reasons appear to us contrived and one-sided. There
is no reference to the fact that US companies are being required to value
directors' share options.
We are concerned that ASB should have let the taskforce look at this issue.
It is a matter of integrity. The taskforce has 16 members. Each of the eight
largest UK accounting firms has a representative. Four members, three
finance directors and a chief executive, come from leading UK companies. So
a majority will probably have been involved either in signing or in auditing
company accounts which arguably did not comply with the Companies Act.
Is it right to allow the law to be judged by those who may not be following
it? Why should share options not be valued along the lines adopted by the
US?

FT  04 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Curious way for Lloyd's to treat its
capital base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr G N M MELLERSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The circular just sent out by Lloyd's debt collectors is more
remarkable than the aspects Mr J Hamilton Stutt highlights (Letters, October
1) in that it seeks payment of 'debts' that everyone from the chairman of
Lloyd's downwards agrees do not exist.
This bizarre situation arises because of the 'double count' - in essence
syndicates writing errors and omissions policies reserving against possible
claims from other syndicates who themselves reserve against such claims not
being paid. Lloyd's itself has been happy to take an overall credit for this
double count in order to satisfy the Department of Trade and Industry's
solvency requirement for the market as a whole, but in spite of repeated
requests, it continues to refuse to make a similar credit available to
individual Names. The result is that many Names able and willing to trade on
will be unable to do so because they decline to make further funds available
to meet what are known as 'solvency deficits' - which do not in fact exist.
The situation will only be resolved when the double count is unwound by the
settlement one way or the other of the many legal actions between Names and
their agents. Who wins and who loses is irrelevant. Meanwhile, Lloyd's
appears determined to inflict the maximum damage on its members - a curious
way to treat the capital base.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Just a pinch of ethics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gordon Brown did his best to reach the Labour party's endogenous zone
yesterday. He did not quite manage that inherently improbable feat. The
shadow chancellor tried, but to little avail. He sensibly avoided the
technical terminology, to do with growth theory, that baffled some of us
when he delivered his now celebrated lecture to a conference on the economy
last week. He was aware that this time he was addressing his party's annual
conference, and tailored his remarks accordingly.
'Let the nurses,' he proclaimed, 'nurse.' Warming to his theme, he added,
'Let the teachers teach.' Encouraged by the rising applause he went on, 'Let
the doctors care.' That is the trouble with the English language. It catches
you out. 'Let the doctors doct', might have carried greater resonance, but
the word 'doct', unlike endogenous, has not yet been coined.
Mr Brown will, I trust, forgive the above little tease. It was irresistible.
He was, however, making a serious point, namely that the Conservatives'
creation of quangos and 'phoney markets' has led to 'administrative chaos
and paper-pushing'. Not every reader will agree with this, but I do. The
health service reforms may be fine in theory, but they have yet to prove
themselves in practice. Ditto the opted-out schools. The shadow chancellor
also gave populist expression to the 'new Labour' view of how to manage the
market economy, something he has spent much energy and time on since April
1992. He did not flinch from the awkward passages, such as: 'It is by
liberating people's potential that we build the dynamic market economy we
need.' He included several jokes of his own, most of them about Lord Jeffrey
Archer.
Alas, political life is not conducted according to the rules of fairness. Mr
Brown's Herculean effort was insufficiently rewarded. The assembly did not
rise to its feet. There was no standing ovation. Tears were not wiped from
the eyes of the faithful. How unjust] The shadow chancellor could not have
worked harder. He is a long-practised conference tub-thumper, and he did his
best. What we need to understand is why the applause, while substantial, was
no more than adequate to the occasion.
A cold start on a Monday morning did not help, but the explanation runs
deeper than that. It is, frankly, that the modernised Labour message has not
yet been expressed in terms that quicken the heart-beat. The blood does not
course more rapidly through the veins on hearing it. Well, mine may but I
have peculiar, commentator's, veins, veins responsive to words like
'communitarian' and, on good days, even to phrases like 'industrial
regeneration'. The pulse rate of the Labour party may accelerate when the
new leader sits down this afternoon, but, absent a tour de force by Mr Tony
Blair, it has to be said that for most delegates this is the most soothing,
most gentle, least contentious of conferences. Never mind the posturing of
some of the trade union leaders. They are old gentlemen in mid-life crisis,
easily slapped down. In spite of them you have to characterise the first day
of this conference as Dullsville, squared.
Reinventing the Left*, published yesterday, tells us why, although it does
not set out to do so. It is a collection of serious essays, edited by David
Miliband, head of policy in Mr Blair's office. As Mr Miliband writes in his
introduction, none of the authors believes in revolution, but all espouse
social and economic reform. This may be sensible philosophy, but it is
milk-and-water politics. Old socialism, with its Marxist infusion and its
martyrs' blood, is now an anachronism. When in vogue it was, if nothing
else, rousing. You were angry with it, or angered by it, as the delegates
were by Mr Arthur Scargill's ranting yesterday. The free market and
libertarian thinking that rose to such ascendancy during the 1980s releases
similar, countervailing, passions. These are, however, cooler, more
querulous, times. Most voters would agree that the unregulated market has
its failures, and many think that the government ought to do something about
that. You need not put your knitting down to make such an observation. It
sums up today's mainstream thinking. Mr Miliband puts it thus: 'The Left
retains its distinctive place in politics today not because of its utopian
vision of the future, but by virtue, first, of its critique of the present,
in other words its analysis of advanced industrial societies, and second its
ambition progressively to achieve change.'
Where does that take us? 'While there is an immediate argument within
politics about the sorts of capitalist society - regulated and humanised, or
deregulated and Hobbesian - we want to live in, there remain ambitions
fundamentally to realign the economic and social order,' says Mr Miliband. I
suspect that the most radical agenda that Labour will find itself able to
offer includes mildly progressive taxation plus the restoration of civic
democracy. The latter is an enterprise to which many thinking Conservatives
are attracted.
The recipe can only be brought alive by adding a pinch of ethics. If people
trouble themselves about the effect of markets alone it is because they know
that the market is an abstract. It has no conscience. Mr Miliband quotes
several writers to the effect that 'unfettered market rule will corrode
precisely the values and institutions on which the social order rests'. This
does not mean Tories, whether Thatcherite or one-nation, are amoral; they
are patently not that. It does mean there is a longing for an ethical
underpinning, felt on all sides of the political spectrum.
Religion may attract some; humanist ethics will suffice for the rest of the
electorate. Mr Blair neither hides nor flaunts his Christianity, but its
existence enables him to speak convincingly of values and principles. His
reformist, centrist, prescriptions for the political economy may inevitably
lack blood-and-guts excitement, but if he can touch the ethical
sensibilities of the party faithful, and by extension the rest of us, he may
yet hear prolonged cheering; if he convinces the troops that, blow the
principles what he offers is victory, there will be an extended stamping of
feet, yells and whistles.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Curious result if deferred tax
provided for on discounted basis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TONY WEDGWOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lex refers to the possibility of establishing deferred tax provision on
a discounted basis ('Deferred tax', September 28). The wind is already
blowing in that direction. In the furore over the provisioning aspects of
FRS7, many people may not have noticed its reference to the discounting of
long-term monetary items. It does not actually say that it should apply to
deferred tax, but this is the implication.
However, until deferred tax is put on to a more rational basis, this could
lead to the rather curious result that deferred tax provisions would be
discounted if they come with an acquisition, but not if they are internally
generated.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Balance will cut costs of housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROY SWANSTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is a pity Jack Straw, Labour's local government spokesman, has
resurrected his party's criticism of deregulated rents in the private rented
sector ('Pounds 4bn cost of housing benefit attacked', September 26). The
way to reduce housing costs for all is to ensure that demand and supply are
in balance. Personal help for those who need it, rather than subsidies to
'bricks and mortar', is more efficient and allows occupiers greater scope to
choose tenure, type of landlord, and size and quality of accommodation.
If the needs of those who cannot otherwise afford adequate housing are to be
met, and if private sector funds are to be tapped for this purpose, both
housing support and rents must be high enough to allow the private sector to
be confident about long-term investment in rented housing. Recent statements
by both the chief secretary to the Treasury and the Labour party have been
unhelpful in these respects.
Nonetheless a more fundamental look at the form of income support for both
homeowners and tenants, with the aims of reducing the poverty trap and
achieving a basis of support which is tenure-neutral, is overdue. Such a
scheme could lead gradually to reduced housing costs to the public purse and
in real terms.

The highlight of the evening should be Alan Bleasdale Presents (Channel 4 at
10.00). The successful creator of Boys from the Black Stuff, and more, tries
his hand as producer of four films, showing off new writers, in this case
Andrew Cullen, and established stars (Jane Horrocks and John Gordon
Sinclair). Self Catering is a black comedy involving the five survivors of a
plane crash who assume the personalities of their screen idols. One looks
forward to Horrocks as Monroe.
Every wildlife film is the same but they offer relaxing viewing with a
salutary lesson: it is hard to feel sentimental about animals after watching
yet another lion stalk its prey. The Savage Paradise (BBC 1 at 8pm) follows
a herd of elephants as they make their annual progress around the waterholes
of north Botswana.
A rapid repeat of The Three Tenors in Concert 1994 the warbling that
heralded the World Cup Final, on BBC 1 at 10.15.
Wasted windfall (Channel 4 at 9pm) tells the story of North Sea oil and
wonders what happened to the economic regeneration it promised.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Arts: Avant-garde images of devastation - At the Barbican
William Packer finds War Art set in its proper international and modernist
context
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain has been alone in distinguishing War Art in this century as a
particular genre. This judgment has had its critical effects. The two world
wars were of course the natural subject of art, for they touched the lives
of artists no less than those of everyone else. But in coming round,
uniquely, in the later years of the first war, to the idea that art should
be officially commissioned as document and memorial, sustaining that policy
through the second war and lodging most of the products within a single
institution, the Imperial War Museum, we set in place a number of idees
fixes, or prejudices.
Throughout Europe, artists of all kinds were drawn into the first world war.
Yet so far as Britain was concerned, the work that came out of it was
subsequently transmuted into a kind of official art that led us to believe
it peculiar to ourselves. And ironically the more avant-garde it was, the
more were we inclined to take it as anything but. For here was art related
directly to a general, shared and awful experience that, safely
institutionalised in popular and public terms, sat quite apart from the rest
of modern and therefore difficult art. Thus set out of its proper
international and modernist context, such art has too long been neglected at
its true critical level.
The premise of the remarkable exhibition that Richard Cork has put together
is the realisation that art, great art and War Art at that, was generated in
every nation touched by the first world war. What it does for the British
art of the war is immediately to rescue it from its unwarranted
parochialism, to test and recognise it as the remarkable achievement it
really is. And to look here, again, for example, at Stanley Spencer's
familiar but still extraordinary and moving painting of 'Travoys'
(mule-drawn stretchers) bringing wounded into a Macedonian dressing-station,
or at Paul Nash's vast and desolating painting of 'The Menin Road', is
suddenly to realise that nothing more serious, more radical, nothing indeed
better in any sense, was being done anywhere else at that time. Picasso?
Matisse? Duchamp? Not at all.
But this is no mere exercise in the rehabilitation of British art. The
context serves all alike, and none more so than the Germans. The only
difference is that with their avant-garde credentials already well intact,
such artists as Dix and Beckmann, Kathe Kollwitz, Grosz and Kirchner, can
more readily be taken as the great artists they are, even though represented
by comparatively incidental work. Do David Jones's illustrations to his own
epic poem of the war, 'In Parenthesis', have a right to stand on equal terms
with such things? Of course they do.
In all such compilations, the minor or the forgotten figures, or those more
familiar but cast in a fresh light, are the more immediately intriguing. The
show begins with a section on the war in anticipation, with images from such
as Balla and Carra of Futurist excitement at the prospect of a great
mechanical cleansing and renewal, made the more dire in knowledge of the
reality to come. The corrective comes in terms of prescient foreboding and
anxiety, with Ludwig Meidner's apocalyptic expressionist visions of ruin and
devastation, and de Chirico, of all people, giving an extra twist to the
idea of what War Art might be with a haunted image of a sailors' barracks.
So the show proceeds through its several sections, from the outbreak of war
and its accompanying patriotic enthusiasms, through deadlock and
disillusionment to the dreadful end, and to aftermath and remembrance. And
we follow the artists in this from their initial fervour and commitment to
resignation, anger and despair. Through it all, the polemical and the
documentary walk hand in hand, with the polemical turning to bitter satire
and irony as time goes on. And as always with such things, while the
polemical might carry the greater immediate emotional force, it is the
cooler observation, that might inform or complement it, that hangs on in the
mind.
The exhibition's epigraph is taken from a letter which Paul Nash wrote from
Passchendaele in 1917: 'it is unspeakable, godless, hopeless. I am no longer
an artist . . . (but) a messenger . . . to those who want the war to go on
for ever. Feeble, inarticulate, will be my message, but it will have a
bitter truth, and may it burn their lousy souls.' Yet his own 'Menin Road'
or 'Mule Track' remain the more resonant as images than his overtly ironical
'We are making a better world', for all that the imagery of devastation is
much the same. For they leave us room to come to our own conclusions. Henry
Lamb's large canvas, 'Advanced Dressing Station on the Struma', his manifest
masterpiece, with its resting stretcher-bearers smoking and chatting beneath
the trees, says it all.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Arts: Outbreak of symbolism in Leeds 'Trovatore' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not for Leeds a French grand opera of the kind acted out in Paris. While the
Bastille made the loss of its music director a drama on an international
scale, Opera North's general director slipped away quietly. Ian Ritchie had
barely had time to settle in before his departure was being announced for a
new job in Scotland without any reasons given - a case of British
understatement.
What this will mean for the company is not yet clear. Whatever Ritchie had
time to plan, it will not have been enough to stamp any personal mark on
Opera North's repertoire or house production style. His name is still listed
in the programme, but only for a few more weeks. The job advertisement has
already been placed for his successor, who will take over with at least one
of the company's assets securely in place: the 1994/5 season looks typically
adventurous.
Amid a variety of obscure operas, Verdi's Il trovatore might look the odd
one out, but for a company with the limited resources of Opera North it is
as much a challenge as any. Finding a cast of four singers who can deliver
Verdi's vocal parts to the standards that audiences now expect from
recordings is difficult enough for international opera-houses, let alone a
regional company with empty coffers.
Having a theatre the size of the Grand at Leeds makes life easier, but the
quartet that Opera North has assembled for this new production passes
muster, and often more. Edmund Barham has been making his way solidly up
through the central tenor roles of the repertoire and Manrico marks a new
rung on his ascent, stylishly phrased in the aria, clarion strong in the
following cabaletta (high B's rather than C's, if I am not mistaken). His is
not an Italian voice, but then nor were the others.
Katerina Kudriavchenko has a backwardly-placed soprano, which lacks open,
Italianate colours, but her Leonora offered a decent compromise between the
lyrical and dramatic sides of role. Ettore Kim's baritone is
tightly-controlled with a fast vibrato, at its best when the Conte di Luna
was being strong and forthright.
None of them found much time for acting - a luxury in this opera at the best
of times, though one might have expected Opera North, with its reputation
for integrated dramatic performances, to reassess the priorities. Sally
Burgess's post-Freudian Azucena, wrestling with the demons in her
conscience, came nearest to a newly thought-out portrayal. Her mezzo's
centre of gravity lies a little high for the part, but has searing top notes
as compensation. Clive Bayley related Ferrando's narration vividly.
At the expense of some unidiomatic literalness in his reading of the score
(Leonora's soaring lines at the end of Part 2 neatly-clipped, with no sense
of grandeur) Paul Daniel gave Verdi his essential demon-driven urgency.
Brilliant wind sounds pierced the orchestral ensemble, just as melodramatic
shafts of lighting periodically burst forth from Inga Levant's gloomy
production. Night and fire - two of the opera's main motifs - were never far
away.
Indeed, the production suffered a nasty outbreak of symbolism early on:
swords of vengeance staked in the ground, a harp for the troubadour, a huge
photo of two infant brothers which Azucena hauled around the stage. Later it
contented itself with supplying a potent background of a community savagely
at war with itself - or was that also meant to be symbolic of a company that
seems to be in the wars backstage itself at the moment?

FT  04 OCT 94 / Arts: The Slab Boys Trilogy - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN SHUTTLEWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After months of critical vilification for a clutch of misconceived projects,
the Young Vic's artistic stock stands in pressing need of a fillip. Tim
Supple's production of John Byrne's greatest theatrical hits goes part of
the way to that end.
Byrne's semi-autobiographical trilogy follows his surrogate Phil McCann,
first seen in The Slab Boys as a callous 19 year old in 1957, harbouring
fierce ambitions towards the Glasgow School of Art while enduring the
workaday grind (literally) in the slab room of a carpet factory. He and his
drain-pipe trousered comrade, Spanky, play often savage tricks on the slab
room runt Hector, pinch sticky buns from the tea lady's trolley, lust after
the statuesque Lucille, give lip to all and sundry, and just occasionally
pulverise paint pigments for use by the carpet designers outside whose desks
they covet.
The Slab Boys remains a marvel of switchback language and moods. Byrne
routinely brings several different vernaculars together within a single
sentence to create linguistic crossbreeds with the head of one idiom, claws
of a second and wings of a third. Phil and Spanky's exchanges are sharp as a
tack and, just as they career between the vocabulary of teddy boys and mock
public school banter, so the emotional register can switch instantly from
superficial mirth to its darker underside and back again without missing a
beat. The ability to deal with personal tragedies and everyday oppressions
without subordinating the comedy of the script to this darker vein, or vice
versa, is one of Byrne's greatest strengths, and the first play of the
trilogy is its most ebullient manifestation.
Its follow up, Cuttin' a Rug, is set at the factory's staff dance on the
evening immediately following the action of The Slab Boys. Its attempt to
locate itself in a different style from the earlier play are, frankly, too
laboured. The first act, set in parallel women's and men's cloakrooms before
the 'staffie' begins, seems little more than a 45 minute prologue; the
frequent asides of characters' inner thoughts to the audience feel
uncomfortably Godberesque. The verbal and emotional sensitivity are still in
evidence, but if seen on its own this play would be robbed of more than half
its strength.
Still Life - taking place in a cemetery, its two acts ten and 15 years after
the other plays - is another kettle of fish again. It sees Byrne giving in
either to the impulse to effect a lengthy and comprehensive closure to the
trilogy, or to vicarious wish-fulfilment in re-writing his own past, or
both. He so immerses himself in the play's heart-to-heart dialogues, in
finally laying bare the characters of Phil, the struggling artist, and
Spanky, the rock muso, that he goes on a good 20 minutes too long. Despite
this over enthusiasm, the play contains moments of brilliantly understated
emotion, and seemingly casual recapitulations of earlier motifs. Still Life
has the feel of a coda, but does possess the dramatic strength to stand on
its own.
Supple's direction is sure footed and unobtrusive. He serves the scripts
admirably; none of the potentially awkward mood collisions come a cropper.
As Phil, Paul Higgins feelingly conveys both the character's manic larking
around and the defensiveness in which it is rooted; more crucially, he does
not overplay the element of 'author's proxy' in Phil until it emerges
naturally in the final play. As much attention is given to Spanky who, in
Stuart McQuarrie's portrayal, is astute enough to keep up with Phil but
never quite gets ahead of the game. Katy Murphy, the acerbic Miss Toner in
Byrne's 1986 television serial Tutti Frutti, brings the same down-to-earth
suss to her performance as Lucille.
Byrne's own set designs are naturally adroit. His costume designs are more
questionable, obviously the author knows what he wants, but the women's
costumes in particular often look less concerned with authenticity or
evocation of a particular style than pandering to contemporary notions of
flash. At any rate, whether or not the plays look right, they indisputably
look good.
Supple presumably hopes that audiences will opt to see the entire trilogy
(either on separate nights or over 11 mercifully ungruelling hours on a
Saturday) rather than settle for one play (which, in all candour, would have
to be The Slab Boys). It remains to be seen whether his calculation will pay
off. In any event, the knives which had been drawn in the Young Vic's
direction are likely to be sheathed again for a while.
At the Young Vic until November 12

FT  04 OCT 94 / Technology: Co-operation at the highest level - A
pioneeering European-Russian mission is focusing on the astronauts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MIRANDA EADIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Soyuz TM-20 due to blast off just before midnight last night from the
Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan is the first mission to carry astronauts
from the European Space Agency alongside Russian cosmonauts.
The spacecraft, carrying one ESA astronaut and two Russians, is heading for
Russia's Mir space station - a permanently manned operational base orbiting
400km above the Earth.
The 30-day mission not only heralds a new era in international space
co-operation, it is also the longest space flight by a western European
astronaut.
'This mission is paving the way to the International Space Station (a
much-disputed project not yet under way) when European astronauts will live
and work in space alongside Americans, Canadians, Japanese and Russians,'
says Jean-Marie Luton, ESA's director general.
Research during the Euromir 94 mission will focus on the effects of
microgravity - the very low gravity environment of an orbiting spacecraft -
on the the human body, information that will be needed if permanent manned
orbiting facilities and interplanetary space flights are to take place.
Profound changes take place in the human body during space flights.
Astronauts' faces quickly become swollen because of the movement of body
fluids from lower parts of the body towards the head. Disorientation is
common. With longer exposure to microgravity, muscles tend to weaken without
gravitational forces to work against, and bones lose minerals. At least 50
per cent of astronauts suffer from space sickness.
It was once thought that osteoporosis (a disorder characterised by increased
fragility of the bones) was controlled by hormonal reactions, yet in space
it was found to be affected by disuse atrophy - the lack of mechanical
forces acting on the bone structure.
'Ultimately it is believed that once a mechanism has been understood, a
means to compensate for it can then be found,' says Heinz Oser, the senior
life scientist in the ESA microgravity programme.
The length of the Euromir 94 mission will allow many of the more subtle
changes in the human body to be monitored over a longer period of time,
increasing the validity of the results. Studies of the muscle system in
particular will benefit. Other investigations will focus on the
cardiovascular, neuro-sensory and skeletal systems. Sleep patterns,
radiation effects and the body's immune system will also being studied.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Technology: Europe to lead Warp attack - Sales of early
version have beaten US levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European computer users are expected to be in the vanguard of IBM's attack
on Microsoft and the Windows operating software. Traditionally, European
customers have lagged two years or more behind their US contemporaries, but
Hermann Lamberti, head of IBM's personal software division in Europe, says
this situation has already been reversed for OS/2, the early version of
Warp.
In 1992, about 500,000 copies of OS/2 were sold in Europe; in 1993 annual
sales were running at more than 1m and this year Mr Lamberti expects to sell
more than 2.5m. US customers are expected to buy slightly more than 2m
copies in 1994.
There seem to be two principal reasons for this. First, while US computer
users have tended to adopt each new generation of software in turn,
Europeans seem to move in jumps. Lamberti argues that users in countries
such as Spain and Portugal, where the PC revolution has been slower to
develop than elsewhere in Europe, are moving from a first generation PC to
the latest Intel 486 or Pentium based system in one step, and are ready for
advanced operating software.
Second, Europe is ahead of the US in some of the key networking
technologies, including the digital telephony standard Integrated Services
Digital Network, and is well-equipped to make use of an advanced
network-based operating system.
Lamberti expects that the tools built into Warp to gain access to the
Internet will appeal particularly to European users. Only about 8-9m
European users regularly dial into the Internet compared with 15m or so in
the US, but interest has been growing rapidly.
The software will have a number of built-in features including simple word
processing, database and spreadsheet software for people who make use of
only a few of the facilities available in proprietary packages. Lamberti
says that nobody should give up a program which suits them in favour of a
Warp version, but many users would welcome a simple, built-in alternative.
Warp anticipates the demise of the keyboard and mouse by handling speech and
pen-based input, but it may be a few years before there is much call for
these features. Warp's list price in the UK will be Pounds 70.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Technology: Breaking windows - IBM is taking on the might of
Microsoft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines aims to 'shatter Windows' with the launch
next week (October 11) of Warp, a completely overhauled version of OS/2, its
personal computer operating system software.
Microsoft's Windows dominates the world market for PC operating systems  -
the software that controls the basic functions of a computer. An estimated
60m PCs have Windows installed, while IBM's OS/2 comes a distant second with
about 6m copies in use.
Warp may, however, prove to be a potent challenger to the Microsoft industry
standard. 'There is no question, Warp is technologically superior to
Windows,' says Karl Wong, of Dataquest, a US market research firm.
While the current versions of Windows are 16-bit operating systems - they
process data in 16-bit chunks - OS/2 is a 32-bit operating system that can
take full advantage of the power of the latest microprocessors, he points
out. For PC users, this means applications will run faster, fetching data
from a disk drive will take fewer seconds, and video on a PC screen will be
sharper.
Another advantage of Warp is that it will fit comfortably into 4MB of
memory, the standard configuration of most PCs sold today, says Wong.
With the introduction of Warp, IBM is seizing a rare opportunity to try to
upstage the software market leader. Microsoft was to have launched a 32-bit
version of Windows, popularly known as by its code name Chicago, towards the
end of last year but the launch has been repeatedly postponed and the
company now says that the software, renamed Windows 95, will not appear
until early next year.
'Arrive in Chicago earlier than expected,' say IBM advertisements for OS/2.
'There is no need to wait in a holding pattern for a 32-bit operating
system.' IBM's wisecracks may raise some laughs among computer buffs, but
the biggest challenge facing Big Blue as it tries to break the Windows hold
on the PC market is that familiarity may have more appeal to the average PC
user than technological superiority.
An April survey of 10,500 PC users conducted by Computer Intelligence
Infocorp, a market research group, found that 23 per cent had never heard of
OS/2, although the first version was introduced seven years ago. Only 4 per
cent did not know of Microsoft's Windows.
IBM plans a Dollars 50m (Pounds 31.6m) advertising campaign for OS/2 over
the next three months, and the company is using many of its senior
executives to seek converts to the product worldwide. Still, operating
system software is a hard sell.
In an attempt to give Warp broader appeal, IBM is packaging the new version
of OS/2 with a bundle of applications designed to lure new customers.
Topping the list is a set of programs that will give instant access to the
Internet, the global computer network.
'The information superhighway is the hottest topic among PC users today, yet
many people really have no idea what it is or how to get on it,' says Wally
Casey, IBM personal software products director of marketing. There are a
million new users logging on to the Internet every month, but about 400,000
give up because it is too hard to use, he says.
IBM plans to tap into the excitement surrounding the Internet by providing
easy-to-use software for a wide range of Internet software. The package will
turn the average PC user into a fully-fledged 'Net surfer'.
'We aim to make OS/2 synonymous with the information superhighway,' says
Casey. Warp users will get immediate access to the Internet via the Advantis
network in the US and other IBM networks worldwide. After 10 free hours of
access, 40 hours of use a month will cost about Dollars 25.
'The IBM information highway will have 'on-ramps' (local access) available
in major metropolitan centres worldwide,' says Casey. IBM already has
telephone lines established in 11 countries to handle the 10m users it
counts on signing up in the next year.
Building on another market trend, IBM will include multimedia software that
enables users of PCs with the relevant add-on circuit boards to watch TV on
the PC screen, host a video conference, or display photographs stored on
disk using Kodak's new PhotoCD technology. For less ambitious PC users, a
suite of office applications is included with Warp as well as some games.
The US list price for Warp is expected to be Dollars 80, but retail
discounts will probably bring it below Dollars 50. And existing OS/2 users
can expect to get an upgrade for Dollars 25 or less. Microsoft's Chicago is
also expected to come packed with extra programs, including Internet
software, although the company has yet to provide details or prices.
OS/2 still faces tough hurdles. The biggest may be the wide perception that
there are few third-party applications such as games and office programs to
run on the IBM operating system. Finding OS/2 applications is usually a
challenge.
Although OS/2 can run applications designed for Windows and MS-Dos, IBM
wants to encourage third-party software developers to create 'native' OS/2
programs and will pay retailers to set aside shelf space for OS/2 programs.
Most PC buyers, however, are unlikely to replace the Windows operating
system software that comes on almost every new PC. Part of IBM's attack is
therefore aimed at PC manufacturers. Microsoft's recent antitrust consent
decree, which forces the company to offer new terms to PC manufacturers that
pre-install Windows software on their products, may give IBM the opening it
needs. 'We are prepared to win this battle by selling software packages one
at a time, but we hope to get it pre-loaded before people buy their PCs,'
says Casey.
Yet few PC makers appear willing to risk switching from the popular
Microsoft software: only CompuAdd, a small US PC company, has announced
plans to install Warp on its PCs.
IBM is expected, however, to announce next week that its own PC division
will put its weight behind OS/2 by loading the software on to its products
along with a copy of Microsoft Windows. This will be the acid test for Warp.
Faced with the option to boot up Windows or Warp, which one will PC users
choose?

FT  04 OCT 94 / People: Coopers partner to EDS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After 23 years with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, John Pendlebury has made the
geographical and cultural leap to Electronic Data Systems, where he will be
leading the US company's 400-strong European consulting practice.
Now 50, he has been a managing partner at Coopers for the past few years. He
will be based in Brussels with an office in the company's UK headquarters at
Stockley Park, west London.
Pendlebury expects to spend much of his time on the road working with
clients and seeking out talented individuals and companies to help fulfill
ambitious plans for the consultancy division.
EDS says Pendlebury will 'direct an aggressive campaign dramatically
expanding the company's management consulting presence and market share
throughout Europe'.
EDS also mentions 'aggressive hiring', although an unaggressive Pendlebury
said yesterday he hoped other consultancies would not take fright at such
language.
An engineer with a first degree and doctorate from Cambridge University,
Pendlebury's first job was with English Electric, now absorbed into GEC.
He worked for Kodak - learning accountancy at night school - before joining
Coopers in the early 1970s. He worked for Coopers in the US, Middle East and
Russia.
EDS, the computing services arm of General Motors of the US, appealed to
Pendlebury because of its global presence and strong technology base.
He will take the lead in shaping the consultancy around the themes of
business process re-engineering, change management and strategic planning.
David Thorpe has been appointed managing director of EDS' public sector
division, with overall responsibility for developing the company's business
with central government and government agencies.
He joins EDS from the board of Bull Information Systems UK, where he was
managing director of Bull's largest operating unit, the systems intergration
and services division.

FT  04 OCT 94 / People: Greene King brews new roles for chairman and chief
executive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Greene King, the East Anglian brewer, has split the roles of chairman and
chief executive. Simon Redman, who has held both posts since 1990, has
become interim non-executive chairman until a successor is appointed early
1995. He will then leave the company.
Tim Bridge, right, managing director since 1990 and descended from the King
family, has become chief executive. 'The board believes the preferred
structure is a non-executive chairman and chief executive,' Bridge said.
The jobs have been split before. Most recently, Redman was chief executive
and Bridge's father John was chairman until 1990. 'There is no strategic
change for the group,' Bridge added.
Redman will have more than two years left of his three-year contract when he
leaves next year. He earned Pounds 118,000 in salary and pension last year
and his departure terms will be set later.
Under Redman's stewardship Greene King has grown steadily but has also
suffered a couple of setbacks. Most notably, its hostile takeover bid for
Morland, the Thames Valley brewer, failed in 1992. Greene King sold its 28.8
per cent stake in Morland last month for Pounds 28.7m but incurred several
million pounds in costs for the abortive bid.
Bridge said decisions such as the Morland bid had been made by the whole
board and were not a factor in yesterday's management changes.
The company is looking for a non-executive chairman with 'a known profile in
the City and financial press', but it has 'an open mind' whether the
successful candidate comes from manufacturing or retailing.
Bridge, 45, joined Greene King in 1970 and has held a variety of posts. No
other Bridges are currently in the company, although members of various
families connected to the founders hold some 15 per cent of the equity.
The Redmans have been linked to the group since 1961 when Greene King bought
Wells and Winch, the Biggleswade brewer. Simon's cousin Tim relinquished
executive duties earlier this year but will remain a Greene King
non-executive director for three years.

FT  04 OCT 94 / People: Marsh bounces back and finds home with Toyota
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has not taken long for motor trade veteran Alan Marsh to bounce back out
of his early retirement from Inchcape in May.
Marsh, 57, with 35 years experience of the car retailing scene, is becoming
the first non-Japanese board member of Toyota Motor Europe Marketing and
Engineering (TMME), the Brussels-based entity which controls most of the
Japanese car giant's European activities, except actual car making.
As vice-chairman of the TMME board, Marsh will be in direct charge of
Toyota's European marketing activities.
That makes it almost business as usual for Marsh. He is a past chairman of
Toyota (GB) and had been running Inchcape's Toyota vehicle distribution
businesses world-wide until the Inchcape board streamlining.
The appointment is an indication of Japan's largest car maker's commitment
to place the running of major regional operations in the hands of
non-Japanese managers. He is unlikely to be the last European board
appointment.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Hard graft for software -
A look at various ways computer entrepreneurs have raised elusive
early-stage finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Never has the application of software made a bigger impact on business and
domestic life than in the 1990s. But surprisingly few software houses in the
UK manage to start up, raise finance and build companies that grow and
survive.
Banks do not like them; they are too dependent on people, and assets such as
debtors tend to evaporate when the software company can no longer provide
service support. Start-ups tend not to be considered by most venture
capitalists, and even finance for later-stage development is scarce.
Bitter experience suggests that most venture funds have not done well in
this area. The pace of change means it is not uncommon for venture
capitalists to require the business to be sold just when the software house
needs to spend more money developing a next generation or new product.
'There is the first start-up funding, when a group of individuals get
together, which may not be fantastically large,' says Philip Purslow,
managing director of Birmingham-based Simtel, which makes pre-production
software for industrial processes. 'You then sell and develop, sell and
develop - but to go faster you need more finance.'
A sine qua non for funding at any stage is a good business plan - one that
includes a clear idea of the software to be developed, the market and the
company's competitive position.
Take Option Systems Limited, a Leicester-based maker of software that helps
customers such as Mizuno, the sports goods company, Pepe Jeans and Hi-Tec
shoes manage their international distribution.
When Terry Forsey and partners launched OSL in 1991, they had considerable
knowledge of their particular niche - software for the textile industry to
help customers manage the supply of different shapes, colours and sizes of
the same item.
Forsey's previous company, Universal CMS, had built sales of Pounds 12m with
the help of a government software development grant and some development
capital. Forsey left when the board decided to freeze further research and
development expenditure on the product - a decision he says was partly
responsible for Universal CMS going out of business in 1991.
When he took the idea of a new company producing similar software to the
bank, he had a product and a clearly-defined set of customers in a niche
market. OSL was able to get off the ground with a mixture of directors'
borrowings, backed by personal guarantees, and a bank loan supported by the
small company loan guarantee scheme.
What is even more unusual is that OSL has sold to 14 companies in 34 sites
around Europe using internally-generated resources. It has avoided the need
to raise external funds partly because it is using distributors who bear
some of the risk and cost and partly because OSL has found and concentrated
on a niche market.
OSL has also adopted a novel way of ensuring that its customers get the
product upgrades they want and not what the supplier thinks they want. It
has handed over much of the authority to spend the R&amp;D budget to a user
group made up of its customers.
'Inherent in the culture of the business is the idea that you have to keep
developing the product,' Forsey says. Instead of growth based on spurts of
development spending - a process that can be difficult to finance -
development becomes continuous, ys.
Rather than try to work on an entirely new product, OSL is now using the
strong cash flow from Pounds 1.6m of sales to push into new geographical
markets.
Purslow says there are few companies that can occupy a small niche market
like this any more. Most software companies must operate in a world where
their market is rapidly changing. It is this that makes funding of the early
stage of a software company's life so risky, he says.
Simtel's early financing also had government support. Purslow's eight years
of developing and marketing software suggest that at an early stage software
entrepreneurs have to be as knowledgeable about sources of grant aid as they
are about their market and product.
When Purslow approached Derek Harris, managing director of Birmingham
Technology Venture Capital, he had no product - just an idea that he could
improve pre-production systems that help manufacturers design and schedule
production and distribution.
Between the three original partners, who put up Pounds 60,000, and
Birmingham Technology Venture Capital, Simtel raised about Pounds 150,000 in
start-up funds.
It then went down a familiar path of supplementing income from its own
software with the sale of bought-in Cad-Cam products. But when it needed to
develop more quickly, Purslow started looking to the Department of Trade and
Industry for grants. Over three years the DTI supplied about Pounds 300,000
 -but only after Simtel had found two collaborative partners.
'Since then we have developed from national schemes to European funding and
the consortiums have become bigger,' says Purslow.
Simtel's last project, funded from the EU's Eureka Famos and Brite Euram
funds, cost Pounds 6m and was done in collaboration with seven partners in
four countries. Now breaking even on sales of about Pounds 2m, Simtel is
moving to a stage where it will limit its development and place more
emphasis on commercial exploitation of the software it has developed.
QSP, now a quoted company making software for integrated financial control
systems, also turned to the DTI for a job creation grant early in its life.
But it was also an exponent of the beg-and-borrow school of early
fundraising. Alan Mordain, its founder, found three companies which agreed
to let him use their IBM mainframes over evenings and weekends for the early
development work.
Only after a couple of years, when the company had about 16 customers, did
Mordain decide QSP needed a mainframe of its own. Then it brought in venture
capitalists Advent Limited.
Leaning on customers, or more likely future customers, is another way for
software houses to finance their development. The customer pays for part of
the development, takes the product at a concessionary rate once it is
developed, but leaves the right to develop and market the product with the
software house.
A variant of this is the route taken by the Software Partnership Limited,
which produces specialist banking software and was recently sold to Deluxe
Data Systems, a subsidiary of the large US cheque printer, Deluxe Corp. To
finance its early days, Software Partnership's three partners became
consult-ants.
Howard Hanson, a co-founder and now research and new technology director for
Deluxe, said this did not simply cross-subsidise the development of generic
software products it was later able to market. By working closely with the
bank, the company was also able to discover exactly what the customer wanted
and what the market was failing to supply.
These alternative solutions to early-stage funding leave most UK venture
capitalists searching for a role. While more are prepared to enter at a
later stage, all but those with the most recent experience in the software
industry seem to find the pace of change too fast.
But, according to Brian Reynolds, a founder of Microfocus, one of the UK's
most successful software companies, finding the initial finance was not the
most difficult part. He did it by borrowing Pounds 5,000 from the bank to
buy a computer on which he developed enough of a product to get backing from
3i two years later.
What was difficult, Reynolds says, was building a company in the UK and the
US. 'All the main competitors are in the US and you have to absorb the way
they think, act and market,' he says. This is an extremely difficult and
hard grind, he has found.
But he is optimistic that new communications, like video-conferencing, are
breaking these barriers down. 'It is a good time for software companies to
start up,' he says.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Management (The Growing Business): One step ahead of the
accountant - Small companies can control the cost of their annual audit if
they prepare the books in advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For four years, John Hudson turned up for the annual audit of a
family-controlled chain of garages to discover that its books were not
ready.
Faced with the same lack of preparation in the fifth year, Hudson turned on
his heel and walked out, threatening to return after three months when he
next had staff available.
Hudson, who has moved on and is now a partner at Accountants Baker Tilly,
says the client quickly got the message. Two days later the books were ready
and the audit was able to progress.
But he says all too often medium-sized companies only focus on their annual
audit when the auditors are on the doorstep.
A surprising number of businesses do not keep accurate books, recognising
that they only need up-to-date cash books and debtor books to survive, he
says. 'The real incentive to get moving is when the auditors are sitting
there,' says Hudson.
The smallest companies have now fallen out of the annual audit net. Since
last November's budget, those with sales of less than Pounds 90,000 are no
longer required to produce external verification of accounts and most
companies with sales between this figure and Pounds 350,000 only need an
independent accountant's report.
But larger small companies with March year-ends should by now have agreed
with their auditors the exact timing and scope of this year's exercise.
Since accountants are selling time, the best way to control costs is for
clients to become involved in planning at an early stage.
Lis Stalker, senior manager at Arram Berlyn Gardner, a medium-sized
accounting firm, agrees that preparation ahead of the auditors' arrival is a
crucial cost-saver. Her firm has compiled a list of ways to control audit
costs.
Before starting an audit, agree a timetable. By agreeing this early, there
is more chance that the auditors familiar with your business will be
available.
Clients who demand an 'express job' because the bank manager is expecting
draft accounts the following week will tend to settle for over-qualified -
and therefore expensive - auditing staff.
Ensure the books are ready. By planning with the auditor, you can discuss
which schedules, books and records will be required.
It is also worth establishing which non-financial papers will be needed.
Capitalise on the knowledge that your auditor has of your business. A good
auditor may well have ideas to improve and update management systems and
ways to make the next audit easier.
Hudson goes further. By adopting an analytical review approach to the audit,
as opposed to a 'tick and bash' vouching audit approach, the auditor is
forced to become conversant with the way the business works. This knowledge
becomes a valuable resource if auditors are properly debriefed.
Keep the auditor informed. 'It is always disconcerting to visit a client and
find that no one has thought to tell you that branches have been opened
during the year, the company has set up an employee profit-sharing scheme or
a new stock-pricing system has been put in place,' says Stalker. Surprises
can drastically affect the scope and level of work required for an audit
opinion and the level of fees.
Having agreed the timetable, it is important to stick to it. Too often the
auditors get involved in preparatory work before they start the audit.
The extra charges which appear on the fee can cause bad blood when the
client questions the bill.
Given that the auditors probably understand the business more than anyone
else outside the company, including the bank manager and the lawyer,
unnecessary conflict over the audit fee should be avoided.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Business and the Law: Further clarity on pension rights -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice last week decided six cases involving the
application of the Rome treaty's equal pay rules (Article 119) to
occupational pension rights. The judgments complete a series of decisions
explaining the 1990 Barber ruling on sex discrimination in pensions.
The historical context of the judgments is that the ECJ first held that the
equal pay rule could be enforced by employees against a private sector
employer in the Defrenne case in 1976. The court limited that judgment's
retroactive effect. In 1986 it went on to rule in Bilka that the right of
access to an occupational pension scheme was subject to the equal pay
principle. But it did not limit this ruling's retroactive effect.
Then, on May 17 1990, the ECJ confirmed in Barber that contracted-out
occupational pension schemes were subject to the equal pay principle.
Accordingly, retirement age discrimination was prohibited. But the Court
limited its ruling to the future, save for prior claims by employees or
those claiming under them.
In three cases decided at the end of 1993 the ECJ clarified the scope and
effect in time of Barber. In Ten Oever, it held the equal pay principle
applied only to benefits payable in respect of employment periods served
after May 17 1990, except for prior claims. It also said survivors' pension
rights were covered by the Barber rules.
In Morroni, the Court said that the Barber principles were not limited to UK
contracted-out pensions but covered occupational pension schemes outside the
social security system and not benefiting from public finance.
In Neath, the ECJ ruled that the use of actuarial factors differing
according to sex in funded defined-benefit pension schemes fell outside the
equal pay rule.
The six cases decided last week fell into two groups. The first concerned
primarily the pension rights of full-time employees, their dependants and
successors against pension scheme trustees. These cases confirmed the
principles established in the three 1993 rulings but also dealt with
outstanding issues on pension trusts, equalisation methods and related
questions. The Court ruled:
Employees and their dependants may enforce their rights to sex equality
against trustees of an occupational pension scheme.
Where national law limits the power of action of employers or trustees in a
way inconsistent with the equal pay principle, they are bound to use all the
means available under domestic law to eliminate sex discrimination,
including recourse to the courts to seek amendment of the pension scheme or
trust deed (themselves governed by national law).
For periods of service after equalisation of pension rights, the retirement
age of women may be increased to that of men. Mitigation of lost benefits
for women is not allowed. For periods of employment post Barber but before
equalisation, the disadvantaged sex must be given the same benefits as the
advantaged. For periods before Barber, the benefits enjoyed by the favoured
sex must not be retroactively reduced.
Single sex schemes are outside the equal pay rule.
The same principles apply to a civil service occupational scheme which may
not discriminate against married men.
Cases C-200/91 Coloroll, C-408/92 Avdel Systems, C-7/93 Beune and C-28/93
Shell, ECJ FC, September 28 1994.
The second group concerns the right of access of married women and part-time
workers (most of whom are women) to occupational pension schemes.
These cases confirmed the Court's earlier decisions dating back to 1976.
They also established that neither the limitation in time of the effect of
Barber nor the parallel provision in Protocol 2 on Article 119 of the Rome
treaty (added by the Maastricht treaty) affects the rights of employees to
enforce the equal pay rules in the context of access to pensions.
However, the ECJ confirmed that national limitation rules apply to claims
made by employees and that, when the schemes are contributory, part-time
employees must make backdated contributions.
Cases C-57/93 Vroege and C-128/93 Fisscher, ECJ FC, September 28 1994.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Business and the Law: Trapped in a time warp - Problems in
England's civil justice system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years ago the English criminal justice system was in crisis following a
series of high-profile miscarriages of justice. Now, say senior judges and
lawyers, there is a crisis in our civil courts which threatens the future of
civil justice. The system is dogged with the twin evils of expense and
delay, and the situation is deteriorating.
Widespread concern about the problem has already prompted action. Last year
the Bar and the Law Society produced a joint report on the future of civil
justice which found in England it was trapped in a Dickensian time warp.
It found the use of new technology in the civil courts was virtually
negligible. Court procedures were technical, inflexible, riddled with rules
and often incomprehensible to litigants. The language of the law was
littered with archaic and irrelevant jargon. Delay was widespread, leading
to ever-increasing costs and frustrating the efficient conduct of commerce
and industry.
The report made a number of suggestions for radical change, including
restructuring the High Court with the creation of more specialised courts
such as the commercial court, widespread introduction of new technology,
simplified procedures, and greater use of alternative dispute resolution.
In addition, Lord Woolf, the law lord, has been asked by Lord Mackay, Lord
Chancellor, to look again at the civil justice system and in particular at
harmonising the rules governing procedures in the High Court and county
courts.
Lord Woolf has already floated a number of ideas, such as making a new breed
of procedural judges responsible for case management and cost control.
Alternatively, he has suggested cases could be handled by teams of judges
working together. His final report is not expected for two years.
Both the work of Lord Woolf and the ideas of the Bar/Law Society report hold
the promise of a brighter future. But without a commitment from the
government to modernise the civil justice system, that brighter future may
never materialise. It is this uncertainty about the government's commitment
that is causing such concern among senior judges and lawyers.
At the Bar's annual conference in London last weekend, Mr Robert Seabrook
QC, chairman of the Bar, welcomed the appointment of Lord Woolf but then
questioned the status of his review. What commitment had the government
given to it? What was his agenda? What resources had he been given? And what
research was he doing?
It seemed clear already, Mr Seabrook said, that no new resources would be
made available by the government to implement any recommendations. This, he
said, was a very short-sighted approach.
Sir Thomas Bingham, Master of the Rolls, suggested that there were three
things which needed to be done to tackle 'the serious ills of expense and
delay'.
The first was the introduction of a computerised case management system
giving judges greater control over the various stages of litigation and a
greater chance of controlling costs.
The second was the introduction of strict time limits on oral argument in
court and a corresponding increase in the issues dealt with by written
submissions. It was almost 150 years since the US Supreme Court had of
necessity first adopted time limits on oral argument, he said. In England
the number of civil appeals showed a marked upward trend, and the backlog of
appeals increased year by year. Sir Thomas said he was hopeful of an
increase in the number of Appeal Court judges, but this on its own was
unlikely to contain, let alone reduce, the waiting times for getting appeals
heard. Time limits on oral argument could help.
His third suggestion was for the greater use of alternative dispute
resolution. At present there was little evidence of ADR being used in
Britain despite its success elsewhere in cutting the time and expense of
business disputes. This neglect of ADR was surprising since England had been
a world leader in the analogous field of arbitration, he said.
Sir Thomas was unsure of the resource implications of his proposals. If
judges were going to spend more time reading documents and less time in
court, there might be a need for more judges. But, he said, whatever the net
cost to the government, he was sure the 'net result will be a great saving
of cost and time to the litigant'.
It was left to Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, the attorney general, to put the
government position. The crisis faced by the civil courts was the result of
a number of trends, he said. The volume of laws had increased dramatically.
Thirty years ago there were only two ways of making laws - through
Parliament or the courts. Today both the courts and parliament were deeply
influenced by Europe and by both the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg
and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. In addition, Brussels
had express law-making powers.
Sir Nicholas said there had been a huge increase in the amount of disclosure
of evidence and information in civil cases, resulting in longer trials. The
legal profession had also increased in size. There were now 8,000 practising
barristers in England and Wales, an increase of 25 per cent over the last
five years. The solicitors' profession had also grown from 34,000 practising
solicitors in 1980 to almost 60,000 in 1994.
Cases were now taking longer and there were more of them. Taking just
applications for judicial review as an example, he said their number had
risen from 160 in 1974 to 1,500 in 1987 to 2,800 in 1993.
Legal Aid had also grown dramatically. For the first 20 years of the legal
aid scheme the total cost of legal aid never exceeded Pounds 10m a year. By
1980 the cost had risen to Pounds 100m, by 1990 to Pounds 1bn, and it was
still rising. Five years ago 2.3m people were helped by legal aid. Last year
that figure had risen to 3.5m people. At the same time the average cost of
each individual action had also risen. Five years ago each action cost
Pounds 204. Today the cost was Pounds 350.
Sir Nicholas said he was in favour of judges taking a more active role in
case management and he saw the benefits of time limits on oral argument.
That system worked well at both the European Court of Justice and the
Strasbourg Human Rights Court. But at the end of the day, he said, resources
were finite and so they had to be put to the best use.
He said he sometimes wondered whether, adapting Parkinson's law, the volume
of litigation expanded to earn the money which was available for it. There
might also be an element of truth in the view that simplifying procedures
and making courts more accessible had only encouraged more litigation.
The measure of the task facing Lord Woolf is now clearer. The government
will support initiatives to cut expense and delay in the civil justice
system provided they do not require extra resources. To the extent that
proposals, such as computerised case management systems and court-annexed
ADR, require extra resources, the money to fund them will have to be found
through efficiency savings elsewhere.
There are those who believe a modern civil justice system cannot be achieved
without the commitment of further resources. If they are right, the crisis
facing the civil justice system looks set to continue.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Business and the Law: Insurance cover - Legal briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial litigators and senior barristers attending a recent litigation
seminar in London favoured changing court rules to force defendants to
disclose their insurance cover at the start of a trial. The lawyers believe
that, by making defendants put their cards on the table at the outset, time
and money could be saved in not pursuing people without resources. This
would bring the UK into line with practice in Canada and the US.
The change would require legislation, because under English law there is a
fiduciary duty on the insured not to disclose details of cover until there
has been a finding of liability.
The move is opposed by insurers, which think plaintiffs would sue only those
with 'deep pockets'. But Mr Justice Otton said he was in favour, provided
the trial judge, who decides damages in the UK, was not told whether the
defendant had cover.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Oil find lifts hopes for field west of Shetland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Optimism about the UK's most promising frontier oil and gas area west of
Shetland received a boost yesterday when Amerada Hess, the US oil company,
reported a successful exploration well close to British Petroleum's
Schiehallion discovery.
The latest well, three kilometres south of BP's discovery, confirms that the
Schiehallion reservoir extends into neighbouring exploration blocks. BP has
estimated Schiehallion's recoverable oil reserves at 250m to 500m barrels.
Amerada Hess, whose partners include Aran Energy, OMV and Murphy Petroleum,
said it will hold talks with BP and its partner Shell on ways to 'appraise
the technical and commercial potential of the field as quickly as possible'.
Amerada Hess also announced that it had bought Esso's 15 per cent share in
the nearby Clair field - a vast 3bn barrel reservoir which, with its complex
geology and remote location, has so far defied development.
The latest find at Schiehallion is expected to encourage other oil companies
with acreage in the area to accelerate exploration programmes.
Last week 10 companies said they were looking at the possibility of an
integrated development scheme which might improve the economic viability of
a number of projects west of Shetland.
The deep water and bad weather in the area - and the absence of established
infrastructure such as pipelines - makes development of the oil and gas
resources relatively risky. Chevron yesterday announced that Ninian has
become only the third North Sea oilfield to produce more than 1bn barrels.
The others are Forties and Brent.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Exchange set to lose role in settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange is likely to lose its lucrative role in equities
settlement when the Crest computerised settlement system is in place.
Yesterday the Bank of England announced that Swift, the international bank
payments messaging system, and a consortium comprising Thomson Financial
Services and Syntegra, a BT subsidiary, were the two finalists in the race
to become the network provider within Crest.
The successful bidder will carry electronic settlement and other messages to
and from Crest and its users. The exchange has withdrawn its own bid.
Following the collapse of the exchange's Taurus project for paperless share
settlement, the Bank of England took responsibility for developing Crest, a
more modest system to speed settlement. The exchange, which currently has
sole responsibility for share settlement, has been seeking a role for itself
since then. Earlier this year the Bank rejected a request from the exchange
to purchase a 30 per cent stake in the Crest holding company.
Had the exchange been successful in its bid to become the network provider,
it could have secured a source of income to replace its current earnings
from securities settlement. In the year to March 31, these were Pounds
55.8m, roughly a quarter of its revenues.
A key factor in the exchange's decision to withdraw its bid is thought to be
the Bank's insistance that it could not rely on the exchange's Sequal
system, which confirms individual share transactions - a vital step in the
settlement process.
Sequal does not have the capacity to give and accept messages from all
international participants in the London market and would have required
significant investment in order to adapt to the needs of Crest.
The exchange said: 'Our conclusion has been that the business case was not
justified.' However it is still interested in becoming the operator of the
Crest system.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Hoverspeed refit to suspend all Channel services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hoverspeed, which operates cross-Channel passenger services, yesterday
announced plans for a refit of its entire hovercraft and catamaran fleet,
leading to the loss of up to 50 out of 410 jobs.
The decision to carry out the simultaneous refurbishment of all three of its
craft will completely shut down its ferry operations in January and close
the Folkestone to Boulogne service for the first three months of the year.
The company said this move was timed to coincide with the quietest period in
the year for ferry operators.
Hoverspeed normally staggers refurbishments to ensure that at least one
craft is in service, but while the entire fleet is out of service the craft
will have a full-scale refit, the company said.
Hoverspeed plans a complete Pounds 2m refurbishment of the interiors of its
two 25-year-old hovercraft, the Princess Anne and the Princess Margaret, as
well as a refit of their mechanical parts. At the same time it will upgrade
its high-speed SeaCat catamaran.
The SeaCat, which normally plies between Folkestone and Boulogne, will
resume operations between Dover and Calais in February. The hovercraft will
return to service at the end of March.
Hoverspeed said most of the redundancies would be on the continental side of
the Channel and that staff would be re-employed when services resume.
The company denied that the refit is related to the start of Channel tunnel
passenger services, but it runs the only service that can match the tunnel
for speed.
The tunnel launched a limited car passenger shuttle service yesterday and
expects to be operating at close to full capacity by next spring. The
British government might not have 'met its commitments' towards the tunnel,
the project's former co-chairman claimed last night.
Hesitations about the building of the high-speed rail link between
Folkestone and London were 'deeply to be deplored', said Mr Andre Benard,
co-chairman of Eurotunnel until earlier this year, contrasting the British
and French approaches.
Speaking at a Chartered Institute of Transport lecture in London, Mr Benard
said that although there was no commitment from the British government to
build the link, 'there was a clear commitment that the railways would
provide all the required capacity.
'In that respect, we have very serious doubts that her majesty's government
has met its commitments.'
Private-sector consortia are bidding to build and run the Pounds 3bn link
but it is unlikely to be in use before the year 2002. The French high-speed
link is already in place and the Belgian one will be in service by 1997.

FT  04 OCT 94 / MPs to speed up gas deregulation probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commons trade and industry committee is to bring forward an
investigation into the government's plans to deregulate the gas market amid
MPs' concerns over the role of the regulator.
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, is lobbying ministers to meet
the deadline for deregulation, which is due to be phased in from 1996, by
including a gas bill in the next parliamentary session.
Mr Richard Caborn, Labour chairman of the committee, said: 'The regulators
are there to regulate and not to develop policy. We must make sure they
carry out their terms of reference and not try and formulate policy.' The
all-party committee is to launch its investigation into the gas market after
the party conferences at the end of next week and plans to publish a report
by the end of the year.
Ms Spottiswoode yesterday rejected suggestions she had overstepped her role.
She said there was 'nothing wrong with the regulator adding her voice' to
the debate over gas liberalisation if it helped to 'clear some of the fog'.
She had a duty to warn the government that the political uncertainty
surrounding a new gas act was damaging to the industry.
Some companies keen to enter the domestic market are unlikely to retain
their interest if the uncertainty continues, while others will delay making
the necessary investments until they know whether full liberalisation by
1998 remains the government's intention.
Ms Spottiswoode said she could not let the rumours and 'scare stories' about
higher domestic gas prices go by unchallenged if they conflicted with the
facts. She described as 'absolute nonsense' rumours that she had threatened
to resign if new gas legislation was not put forward.
Many MPs are concerned that if the gas market is opened up too quickly it
could adversely affect gas prices. Mr Caborn said: 'The report into the
industry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommended that
deregulation of the market should be treated with caution.'
However the Department of Trade and Industry is unlikely to bring forward
its plan to open up the domestic gas market if it gains the cabinet's formal
approval for the controversial sale of a 51 per cent stake in the Royal
Mail.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Mental health plans may win legislative slot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bill introducing stronger government powers to supervise the mentally ill
after they are discharged from hospital has emerged as a candidate for
inclusion in next year's legislative programme.
The measure, which is being strongly promoted by the Department of Health,
is one of a number whose prospects would be improved by a decision not to go
ahead with Post Office privatisation.
The fate of the proposals to privatise Royal Mail and Parcelforce is now
more firmly than ever in the hands of government business managers, who must
decide whether the legislation could be pushed through without a high risk
of damaging defeats in parliament.
This follows a succession of critical responses to the government's plans
for the mail service in recent weeks, including a formal submission by the
nine Ulster Unionist MPs at Westminster saying they oppose them.
Privatisation continues to enjoy strong support in cabinet, particularly
from Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor. But Mr John Major, the prime minister, has not yet
made up his mind.
Downing Street said yesterday it would be surprised if a final decision on
how to proceed would be made at Thursday's meeting of the cabinet - the last
before next week's Conservative party conference in Bournemouth.
A decision to press ahead with the introduction of a new power of supervised
discharge for mentally ill patients would give the Department of Health
under Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, a heavy legislative
workload in 1994-95.
Ministers have already given the go-ahead for a potentially controversial
bill providing for the dismantling of regional health authorities and the
extension of fund-holding by GPs. Other measures which may get better
prospects of parliamentary time if the Post Office legislation is dropped
could include the gas deregulation bill and a bill setting up a body to
investigate alleged miscarriages of justice.
Ministers are also still considering whether a bill implementing further
reform of the unpopular Child Support Agency is needed. A senior Department
of Social Security official is understood to have visited Australia during
the summer to assess whether there is anything to be learnt from experience
there.
The government first announced its intention to introduce the new power of
supervised discharge in August last year. This followed a review of the 1983
Mental Health Act and growing public concern over murders and other acts of
violence involving former mental patients released into the community.

FT  04 OCT 94 / SNP gains ground as Labour falls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish National party is gaining ground mainly at the expense of
Labour, an opinion poll in The Herald newspaper in Glasgow says.
The System Three poll puts the SNP on 29 per cent, a rise of five points on
last month. Labour has 51 per cent, down four points, and the Tories 11 per
cent, down one point.
Mr Alex Salmond, SNP leader, said: 'This poll shows that the Blair bubble is
starting to burst. As Labour's southern agenda moves further and further
away from mainstream Scottish values, this swing from Labour to the SNP will
continue.'
The poll of 1,024 people in 40 constituencies, was conducted late last
month. Figures exclude 16 per cent 'don't knows' or 'won't says'.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Ayrshire pylons inquiry opens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The plan to run a line of pylons across south Ayrshire to take power from
Scotland to Northern Ireland is to be considered at a public inquiry which
opens in Ayr today and is likely to last more than two months.
The 40-mile line of pylons is part of a proposed Pounds 175m scheme for
ScottishPower to supply Northern Ireland Electricity with 250MW of power.
The European Union has promised a grant of Pounds 61m and ScottishPower will
invest Pounds 20m.
The project has attracted strong opposition in Ayrshire from a campaign
group which says the pylons will ruin some of the finest scenery in
Scotland, pose a health hazard and damage the local economy.
Northern Ireland Electricity says the scheme is the best solution for
meeting its expected power shortfall after 1997. Scottish Power sees the
project as a way of increasing output and maximising the use of its
coal-burning power stations.
The scheme would involve building more than 200 pylons from a site near Ayr
to Ballantrae in south-west Ayrshire.
Kyle and Carrick district council, across which the pylons would run, is one
the leading objectors. However, a consultants' report commissioned by the
council said the project would bring substantial benefits to Scotland.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Judges reject power line plea
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is not obliged to adopt special precautions under European
law to safeguard children from exposure to possible health risks from new
underground power cables, two High Court judges ruled yesterday.
Three children from London, acting through their fathers, applied for court
orders requiring Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to
fulfil his duty to protect the public and direct National Grid to ensure
that electromagnetic fields from new cables do not exceed levels which
latest research suggests are safe.
The children live in South Woodford, where National Grid is laying a
high-voltage underground cable. Their parents fear dangerous electromagnetic
fields could increase the risk of childhood leukaemia and other cancers.
Their lawyers argued that changes in European law required member states to
act on 'precautionary' principles when carrying out legal duties. But Lord
Justice Farquharson and Mrs Justice Smith refused their application for
judicial review.
The parents are considering an appeal to the Court of Appeal and then, if
still unsuccessful, taking their case to the European Court of Justice.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Safeway and Asda join food price skirmish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Supermarket chains Safeway and Asda yesterday joined the latest skirmish in
the food price wars as a report from Verdict, the research group, said
retailers faced a disappointing Christmas and years of slow retail growth.
Asda, the fourth-largest grocery retailer, announced a No Nonsense price
freeze on 7,000 grocery and non-food items until at least January.
And Safeway, the superstore chain owned by Argyll, the UK's third-largest
food retailing group, launched a Pounds 7m advertising campaign called
Lightening the Load to highlight 'value-added' aspects of its stores, such
as bag-packing and carry-out services, wide aisles, baby-changing facilities
and its refund and replace guarantee scheme.
The campaign is designed to support Safeway's new Price Watch initiative - a
guarantee to customers that they can buy products at prices competitive with
those of rivals such as Sainsbury and Tesco. Independent pricing research
suggests that customers see Safeway as expensive. Last month Safeway
introduced a range of 100 basic own-label goods at low prices, called
Safeway Savers - similar to the Value range launched last year by Tesco, the
UK's second-largest food retailer.
Shares in Argyll fell 5p to 270p, and Asda shares closed down 3 1/4 p at 62
1/4 p. Shares in Sainsbury, however, rose 2p to 402p on news of its Pounds
205m investment in the US supermarket chain Giant Food. Shoprite, the
discount retailer which operates mainly in Scotland, yesterday issued its
second profits warning in four months.
The moves by Safeway and Asda follow the nationwide launch last week of a
New Deal initiative from Tesco. Tested in north-west England, this involves
price cuts on 100 own-label and branded goods, backed by a Pounds 1m
advertising campaign.
The fierce price competition between supermarkets began almost 18 months ago
with the Price Check campaign launched by Gateway - renamed Somerfield - in
response to discount retailers and the increasing saturation of the grocery
market.
In its annual four-year retailing forecast, Verdict says that price
competition will remain 'intense' between food retailers for the foreseeable
future. It warns that retail trading will 'get worse before it gets better',
with consumer demand slowing as a result of higher taxes and the rise in
interest rates. These are likely to make Christmas 'disappointing', with
slower growth than last year.
The report also forecasts that annual retail sales growth will remain below
the level of almost 6 per cent recorded in 1993.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Break-up of Nuclear Electric to be urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prof Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry regulator, is expected later
this week to deliver a blow to Nuclear Electric, the state-owned power
generator, by asking the government to consider splitting it up.
He will also raise the possibility of changes to Scottish Nuclear as part of
a wide-ranging restructuring of the industry.
Prof Littlechild will back the companies' campaigns for privatisation but
make clear his view that restructuring is essential if a sell-off is
approved.
As regulator Prof Littlechild does not have the power to implement the ideas
he is floating. However, his views, contained in his submission to the
government's nuclear review, are bound to influence the government.
Prof Littlechild is concerned about the growing share - 23 per cent -
Nuclear Electric has of the England and Wales electricity market and about
Scottish Nuclear's 47 per cent share north of the border.
In its submission to the review Nuclear Electric suggested the creation of a
private-sector company for its more modern power stations, leaving its older
Magnox stations in the public sector.
Prof Littlechild will ask the government to consider taking the more radical
step of dividing the ownership of Nuclear Electric's advanced gas-cooled
reactor stations.
Nuclear Electric said yesterday it had not seen Prof Littlechild's
recommendations. Mr Mike Kirwan, finance director, said any break-up
decision would be for the government
He said his company did not abuse its position in the market and, because
Nuclear Electric was not setting prices in the wholesale electricity pool,
there would be no competitive advantage in splitting it up. He added that
smaller companies would weaken the nuclear industry's potential to export
its technology and know-how.

FT  04 OCT 94 / US ends ban on meetings with Sinn Fein
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure on London to clear the way for preliminary talks with Sinn Fein
mounted significantly yesterday as the US launched the start of 'a normal
relationship' with the IRA's political wing.
Mr Al Gore, US vice-president, informed Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein's
president, in a telephone call that the US was ending its formal policy of
not meeting Sinn Fein officials.
A senior administration official said: 'The way to read this is the
beginning of a relationship with Sinn Fein, a party with whom we've had no
official contacts for 25 years.'
Mr Gore's telephone call appeared carefully calibrated to raise the contact
with Mr Adams to the highest level possible without offending the British
government by a meeting at the White House.
Although Mr Adams has been pressing for a week for a more conspicuous
meeting with Mr Bill Clinton, US president, or Mr Gore, administration
officials said he had not made any formal request for such a meeting.
Downing Street's response to the telephone call was low-key. Officials
emphasised that 'the Americans have got to decide for themselves' how they
receive Mr Adams.
The government is analysing with great care remarks made by Sinn Fein's
president during his second visit to the US this year.
London has promised to begin a dialogue on admitting Sinn Fein to talks on
Northern Ireland's future within three months of a permanent end to IRA
violence, but it is still not convinced that the month-old ceasefire is for
good. Senior officials said yesterday that every day which passed 'without
violence, without killing' gave grounds for optimism.
A first meeting will take place today at the State Department between Mr
Adams and Mr John Kornblum, deputy assistant secretary of state for European
affairs. Mr Kornblum will be joined by Mr Leon Fuerth, national security
adviser to Mr Gore, and Ms Nancy Soderberg, staff director of the White
House National Security Council.
In a letter to Mr Adams Mr Anthony Lake, Mr Clinton's principal national
security adviser, said the Sinn Fein leader's 'role in bringing about the
IRA ceasefire was a courageous step forward for peace'.
A senior US official said the letter had been 'carefully written' so as 'not
to get into word-games' over Mr Adams's refusal to describe the ceasefire as
'permanent'.
Yesterday's move came as Mr Adams prepared for a high-profile television
debate with Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South
Tyrone.

FT  04 OCT 94 / N-plant risks 'can be priced'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors would be able to put a price on nuclear risks if the government
decided to privatise the UK nuclear power industry, say the US financial
advisers to Nuclear Electric, the state-owned utility.
Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street investment firm, says in a report that
experience in countries with privately owned nuclear utilities shows that
investors are sophisticated enough to be able to put a price on nuclear
shares and trade them.
The report says that, in the US, shares of utilities owning nuclear power
stations have performed at least as well as other US utilities over the past
five years.
It points out that investors are more interested in a management's ability
to handle risk than in the risks themselves.
The report concludes that a privatised Nuclear Electric would be compared to
the highly-rated nuclear utilities in the US because of the strong
improvements in performance that the company has been able to achieve
recently.
Morgan Stanley is advising Nuclear Electric during the current government
review of nuclear power. Its team is headed by Mr Francis Maude, a former
junior Treasury minister who lost his Commons seat at the last general
election.
The conclusion of the report runs counter to the view of the UK government
in 1989 when it decided against privatising nuclear power because it
believed that investors would refuse to invest in nuclear shares.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Police chief fears Pounds 6m cut would be 'criminal's
charter'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Home Office plan to cut Pounds 6m from Lincolnshire's police budget would
be a 'criminal's charter', Mr Peter Bensley, the county's chief constable,
said yesterday. If the cuts were implemented in April, the consequences
would be catastrophic.
Leaked government documents suggest that Pounds 11m will be axed from forces
throughout England and Wales. Lincolnshire would bear the heaviest blow with
'upwards of Pounds 6m' cut from its spending.
Mr Barry Fippard, chairman of the Lincolnshire police committee, said the
force appeared to be paying for success. 'If you are good you are
penalised,' he added. 'Lincolnshire is a very lean, slim force, and the Home
Office is trying to put us on a diet.'
Mr Bensley said the proposals were equivalent to closing police stations in
seven towns. Lincolnshire police were being punished because of significant
efficiency improvements. He was supported by an all-party group of
councillors and magistrates from the police committee.
The chief constable pointed out that his force had an excellent record of
value-for-money policing and had one officer for every 500 people compared
with the national average of one to 400.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Companies House plans attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London users of Companies House said yesterday that plans to contract out
its services to the private sector threatened the future availability of
corporate information in the capital.
About 50 users, specialising in company formations and searches, met in
London to question SRU, the private-sector consultants seeking views on
contracting out.
Companies House, the official repository of corporate information in
England, Scotland and Wales, is based in Cardiff and has five regional
offices. It holds the details of nearly 1m companies and last year handled
the incorporation of nearly 100,000 new ones.
A campaign led by the Civil and Public Services Association aims to kill off
the plan announced by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, in
July this year.
Mr Kevin Brown, managing director of Marriots Company Services, said: 'SRU
did not appear to have any idea about the structure of the market. They
simply have not thought the process through.'
He said his company paid Pounds 60,000 a year in fees to Companies House,
and warned that contracting out threatened much higher access fees and the
future of the London retail outlet. 'I think this is simply an ideological
move,' he said.
Mr Graham Cowan, managing director of Access Company Information, said
London users feared that information might only be available in an expensive
wholesale form in future. He said many small businesses were worried that
carrying out daily company searches would be impossible and that in the end
the London service would be scrapped.
Business information companies feared that data might be concentrated in the
hands of between two and four large operators spending Pounds 100,000 a year
for access.
Mr Peter Scott of SRU said it planned to meet many more customers and hear
their views, and that no final decisions had been taken about the future of
Companies House.
A final report to Mr Heseltine is due in late October.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Hwang brothers linked to County Hall development
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Hong Kong property investors Mr George Hwang and Mr Victor Hwang are in
discussions which could lead to their involvement in controversial plans to
turn County Hall, the former Greater London Council headquarters, into a
hotel and leisure complex.
The Hwang brothers, who bought Battersea Power Station last year, are
talking to Mr Takashi Shirayama, the Japanese investor whose company's
Pounds 60m offer for the main building in the County Hall complex, across
the Thames from the Houses of Parliament, was accepted by the government two
years ago.
A proposal, which enjoyed cross-party support, to relocate the London School
of Economics to the site was rejected.
Shirayama said yesterday that redevelopment was on schedule and the company
had no intention of selling its interest. Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group
has a management contract to run the 600-bedroom hotel, which is expected to
open early in 1997. However, the hotel will take up less than a third of the
available 1.5m sq ft and Shirayama is considering proposals for the
remaining space.
The London Residuary Body, which has the job of disposing of former GLC
property, is still looking for buyers for three other buildings on the site
which total 700,000 sq ft.
It was suggested yesterday that the Hwang brothers' principal interest was
in the main building.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Police chief slams proposed Pounds 6m cut
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Home Office plan to cut Pounds 6m from Lincolnshire's police budget would
be a 'criminal's charter', Mr Peter Bensley, the county's chief constable,
said yesterday.
Leaked government documents suggest that Pounds 11m will be axed from forces
throughout England and Wales. Lincolnshire would bear the heaviest blow with
'upwards of Pounds 6m' cut from its spending.
Mr Barry Fippard, chairman of the Lincolnshire police committee, said the
force appeared to be paying for success.
Mr Bensley said the proposals were equivalent to closing police stations in
seven towns. Lincolnshire police were being punished because of significant
efficiency improvements.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Gooda Names set to win court case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A High Court judge will today deliver judgment in the case brought by more
than 3,000 Lloyd's Names against the Gooda Walker insurance syndicates, John
Mason writes.
It is expected that the judge will rule in favour of the Names. They are
suing Gooda Walker, a members' agency and managing agency in the insurance
market, for negligence.
They are claiming Pounds 629m in the largest civil action ever heard before
an English court.
Mrs Sarah Gibb, group secretary of the Gooda Walker Action Group, said
yesterday: 'We are optimistic about the result of our case.'
If Mr Justice Phillips rules in favour of the Names, interest will focus on
his comments about the workings of the London insurance market in the mid
and late 1980s and the size of the damages he awards.
The award would be likely to be the largest ever made in an English court,
exceeding the Pounds 172m won in October last year by the liquidators of
British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings against the merchant bankers Samuel Montagu.
Mr Justice Phillips is not expected to award a specific amount of money to
the Names, but to lay down the principles for awarding the damages, which
will be calculated from the published accounts of the syndicates.
The judgment is likely have a substantial impact on the other Lloyd's cases
being brought before the High Court, particularly those relating to the
'spiral' in which Lloyd's syndicates re-insured each other. The losses of
Names on spiral syndicates exceed Pounds 2bn.
But it is likely to remain unclear for some time how much the Names will
actually receive.
There is uncertainty about how much insurance cover the agencies that were
sued have under their 'errors and omissions' policies. Some of those
policies were also underwritten within the Lloyd's market.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Companies House plans attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London users of Companies House said yesterday that plans to contract out
its services to the private sector threatened the availability of corporate
information in the capital.
About 50 users specialising in company formations and searches met in London
to question SRU, the private-sector consultants seeking views on contracting
out.
Companies House, the official repository of corporate information in
England, Scotland and Wales, is based in Cardiff and has five regional
offices. It holds the details of nearly 1m companies and last year handled
the incorporation of nearly 100,000 new ones.
A campaign led by the Civil and Public Services Association aims to kill the
plan announced by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, in
July this year.
Mr Kevin Brown, managing director of Marriots Company Services, said: 'SRU
did not appear to have any idea about the structure of the market. They
simply have not thought the process through.'
Mr Graham Cowan of Access Company Information said many small businesses
were worried that carrying out daily company searches would be impossible
and that the London service would be scrapped.
Business information companies feared that data might be concentrated in the
hands of between two and four large operators.
Mr Peter Scott of SRU said it planned to meet more customers and that no
final decisions had been taken.
A final report to Mr Heseltine is due later this month.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Walker defendant 'scarcely involved'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former finance director of Brent Walker, the property
and leisure group, had little involvement in the alleged fraudulent boosting
of the company's profits, his counsel told the Old Bailey yesterday.
Mr Roy Amlot QC, in a closing speech on behalf of Mr Aquilina, also
criticised the prosecution for being 'obsessive and oppressive' in the way
it brought its case against Mr Aquilina and Mr George Walker, the former
Brent Walker chairman.
Mr Walker and Mr Aquilina are both accused of falsely inflating the
company's profits by more than Pounds 19m between 1984 and 1989. They both
deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiring to falsify the Brent
Walker accounts.
The prosecution claims the profit-boosting took place through the Brent
Walker film division. It alleges that bogus film rights sales were booked to
the accounts of both the film subsidiary and Brent Walker, that the
transactions were funded by Brent Walker itself and that they were concealed
by money-laundering through overseas companies and trusts.
Mr Aquilina played only a small part in the events the prosecution claimed
amounted to a fraud, said Mr Amlot. He could not authorise payments of more
than Pounds 50,000 and his name featured only to a limited extent in the
movements of money. 'Mr Aquilina is scarcely involved in the transfers,' he
said.
He had also received no financial benefit from the alleged fraud, Mr Amlot
continued. The trial continues on Thursday when the judge begins his summing
up. The jury is due to retire on Monday October 17.

FT  04 OCT 94 / M0 growth accelerates abruptly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the government's main indicators of inflation surged last month,
raising fears yesterday that interest rates may have to rise again before
the end of this year.
The annual rate of growth of M0, the narrow measure of money supply, jumped
to a seasonally adjusted 7.1 per cent last month from 6.3 per cent in
August, Bank of England figures showed yesterday.
M0 is seen as a rough guide to activity in the high street because greater
retail spending creates extra demand for cash. The surge in M0 may indicate
that consumer spending is still buoyant, although the government is keen for
the recovery to focus on exports and investment.
Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, said yesterday that he was
looking for more moderate growth in consumer spending 'to make room for
expansion in other sectors of the economy'.
Referring to last month's increase of half a percentage point in interest
rates, Mr George added that 'it will be some time before we can be sure that
the move we made was necessary or sufficient'.
Annual growth in M0 has consistently stayed outside the government's
monitoring range of 0 per cent to 4 per cent and Mr George expressed concern
about the pace of M0 growth in the minutes of his June monetary meeting with
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. Until yesterday's figure emerged, M0
growth had shown signs of slowing.
Analysts pointed out, however, that the sudden jump in M0 last month may
have been caused by a statistical blip. The change in the annual rate of
growth of notes and coins, the main component of M0, was relatively modest,
showing a rise from 6.8 per cent in August to 7 per cent last month.
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, pointed out that
the six-month annualised growth rate of the notes-and-coins element actually
fell - from 7.3 per cent to 7.1 per cent - between August and September.
The cause of the sharp jump in the monetary aggregate was the other
component of M0: banks' operational deposits. This volatile statistic rose
38 per cent between August and September, having fallen 48 per cent between
July and August.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, M0 rose 1 per cent between August and
September, but unadjusted it fell 0.3 per cent. This may indicate a problem
with the seasonal adjustment process, according to Mr Nick Parsons, chief
economist in London with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Row erupts over digital TV code
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A row has broken out over a new code of conduct designed to prevent abuse of
industrial power in the new age of digital television.
All the UK's terrestrial broadcasters - ITV, backed by the Independent
Television Commission, the BBC and Channel 4 - voted against the code at a
meeting of the steering board of the European Digital Video Broadcasting
project in Geneva last week.
The DVB brings together 145 organisations with an interest in setting
standards for the launch of digital television which should be able to offer
many more channels than the analogue system.
The traditional broadcasters, who hope eventually to enter digital services,
fear potential abuses if a single organisation is allowed to own a
proprietary 'smart card' or conditional access system while owning a
subscriber management system and broadcast channels.
Such vertical integration is permitted under the new code of conduct
although the DVB board recommended that there should be a common scrambling
system and interface so that the owner of DVB receiving equipment anywhere
in Europe should be able to receive all programmes available through a
single receiver.
The board decided, however, that everything apart from the common scrambling
system can be proprietary and subject to a licensing regime. Manufacturers
will be free to include a common interface or different conditional access
systems in a receiver.
For ITV, the issue is whether there is one slot for a single smart card in a
receiver or more than one to permit competing services. It fears that a
single 'gatekeeper' could operate a monopoly against the public interest.
The code specifies that, where licensing occurs 'it should be on fair,
reasonable and non-discriminatory grounds'. Twelve out of 17 broadcasters
voted against the code although the majority in favour rose to 75 per cent
when all the industrial interests were included.
ITV believes the code is full of legal loopholes, and is inadequately
defined and incapable of enforcement.
UK broadcasters plan to campaign for further scrutiny by the European
parliament - certainly in discussions on a draft directive on television
signal standards and possibly through competition law.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Machine tool makers drill through to the light: Andrew
Baxter finds market awakening after several false dawns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There may be no smiles yet, but at least there is relief on the faces of
machine tool company executives as the 'confidence factor' returns among
customers in manufacturing industry.
After the deepest, longest recession in living memory, and several
frustrating false dawns, the market is finally moving.
'Things are picking up,' said Mr John Wareing, managing director of
Leicester-based Jones &amp; Shipman, which makes grinding machines. Its UK
orders are up 50 per cent so far this year - excluding a one-off Pounds
810,000 contract for eight machines which it announced this week.
At Luton-based Bruderer, which sells precision presses, managing director Mr
Bill Burrell said: 'Industry has decided it can't wait any more for help
from the government, it just has to have the kit to be competitive.'
Official figures earlier this month showed domestic sales of machine tools
rose 12.1 per cent in the three months to July compared with the previous
three months.
A Financial Times straw poll of machine tool makers suggests the value of
the UK machine tool market could rise between 15 per cent and 20 per cent
this year from the Pounds 652m last year estimated by the Machine Tool
Technologies Association.
The rise could not have come a moment too soon for producers, although it
would still leave the UK market some way behind the peaks of about Pounds
1bn in 1989 and 1990.
In some cases, delivery times are increasing as machine tool builders and
their parts suppliers work flat out to keep up with demand. After the
swingeing capacity and job cuts of the past three years - which halved the
industry's workforce to about 12,000 - extra workers are being taken on, but
in very small numbers and as a last resort.
The machine tool industry is normally one of the last to recover from a
recession, and large machine orders and multi-million pound manufacturing
projects tend to trail behind the less costly contracts for smaller,
standard machines.
All the machine tool builders contacted by the FT reported an upturn in UK
business, but, as expected, producers of smaller machines are having the
best of it.
These include companies such as the 600 Group, a manufacturer of lathes
whose UK machine tool orders are up about 40 per cent so far this year.
'Business is much better than it was, but it's not booming yet,' said Mr
Tony Sweeten, managing director of the machine tool division.
The upturn is spread across all industries, with customers focusing on
machines that increase productivity.
At Leicester-based Bridgeport Machines, which makes machining centres,
business is up 25 per cent this financial year, managing director Mr Malcolm
Taylor said. 'Projects that were sidelined a couple of years ago are coming
to fruition.'
Bridgeport's new business has come both from blue-chip companies such as
British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce and small subcontractors. But there are
some regional variations - the north-east, in particular was 'sluggish to
say the least', perhaps a result of the knock-on effect for subcontractors
of the Swan Hunter receivership.
Mr Wareing at J &amp; S agreed that the upturn in orders reflected increased
confidence among large and small customers. 'Most people are feeling pretty
perky now in industry,' he said.
Among producers of bigger machines and systems, Mr Don McBean, sales
director at Merseyside-based Giddings &amp; Lewis, reported a 'definite increase
in real inquiries,' and business up 10 per cent overall. Its standard
machining centres in particular were selling well, but with large projects
the main problem was anticipating when companies would place an order.
At Swiss-owned Bruderer, order intake began improving last year and is now
more than 80 per cent up on the average levels during the recession, Mr
Burrell said. He saw this as a sign of confidence among customers that they
can make new presses pay, because the strength of the Swiss franc has made
it harder for machine tool importers to compete on price. Japanese suppliers
have had the same problem.
The one possible obstacle is increases in interest rates. Producers say the
recent half-point rise has not affected customers' outlook, but are
concerned about further rises.
Mr Taylor at Bridgeport was worried about suggestions that base rates could
rise between 7 per cent and 8 per cent next year. 'As soon as you start
playing around with interest rates, it sends shudders through industry,
which needs stability for a while,' he said.
At G &amp; L, Mr McBean said: 'The last thing we would want to see is anything
that would stop a customer making a decision.'
Mr Wareing pointed out that, interest rates apart, 'all the signs are good
for the UK economy'. After grinding their way through the recession, machine
tool builders hope things will stay that way.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Peas fail industry's 'tenderometers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Far fewer peas than usual have passed the 'tenderometer' test for freezing
this year because of the hot dry summer, causing a serious shortage of
frozen vegetables which will push up prices, processors warn.
The pea crop is down by 10 per cent, while broad-bean production has been
halved. Shortages have been worsened by the fact that the unusually hot
weather spread from as far south as Spain up to Scandinavia so that buyers
are fighting for supplies.
The problem began with the cold, wet winter and wet spring, which meant
crops were sown late and failed to develop strong roots, said Mr Arthur
Whitlock of the Frozen Vegetables Association, which represents the UK's
main processors.
The weak plants then suffered stress from the drought, which also forced
them to mature too quickly. For peas, which are measured with a
'tenderometer' for freezing, the normal time limit for harvesting was cut
from four or five hours to as little as two.
'A lot of the crops had to be left because they got too tough,' said Mr
Whitlock.
The problem is also affecting later crops such as broccoli and cauliflower.
The young plants struggled to establish themselves in the dry weather and
now risk being damaged by the first frosts before they are ready for
harvesting.
'All the growers with whom the processors are contracted are unlikely to
meet their targeted tonnages,' said Mr Whitlock. 'I can't recall another
occasion in the last five years when the UK and west Europe have both been
down the pan together.'

FT  04 OCT 94 / Home price drop 'steepest since 1990'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The biggest monthly fall in house prices for almost four years occurred last
month according to figures published yesterday by Nationwide, the
second-largest building society.
The average price of a home declined by 2.9 per cent to Pounds 53,918 last
month compared with August.
This represented the biggest monthly fall since prices dropped 3.7 per cent
in October 1990, said the society.
Monthly movements in house prices have fluctuated wildly this year as
confidence among buyers has remained fragile.
Prices in July and August rose 1.8 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively
following a 0.7 per cent decline in June, according to Nationwide.
The underlying movement has generally been flat, said the society, adding:
'House prices now look likely to end the year little changed from 1993,
although experience will vary widely according to local conditions.'
Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, is expected to confirm this
trend when it publishes its monthly house price index tomorrow. Halifax's
survey is likely to show very little movement in prices between August and
September.
Neither society expects to see much change in a generally subdued housing
market as a result of the rise last month in interest rates of half a
percentage point.
Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide chief executive, said: 'The recent relatively
small rise in interest rates should have no material effect on house sales.
'We continue to expect a renewed strengthening of the market based on still
excellent affordability and the wider economic recovery.'
He added that the decline last month was due partly to 'a correction
following a rise over the previous two months'.
Mr Davis added: 'As we have said consistently, a single month's figures need
to be seen in context. It leaves the overall trend of stability in prices
this year broadly unchanged.'
According to Nationwide, house prices on average rose by 1.4 per cent during
the 12 months to September. Halifax is expected to show a very slight
decline in prices over the same period.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Ayrshire pylons inquiry opens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The plan to run a line of pylons across south Ayrshire to take power from
Scotland to Northern Ireland is to be considered at a public inquiry which
opens in Ayr today and is likely to last more than two months.
The 40-mile line of pylons is part of a proposed interconnector whereby
ScottishPower will supply Northern Ireland Electricity with 250MW of power.
The project will cost Pounds 175m. The European Union has promised a grant
of Pounds 61m and ScottishPower will invest Pounds 20m.
The project has attracted strong opposition in Ayrshire from a campaign
group called Stop the Overhead Powerlines - otherwise known simply as Stop -
which argues that the pylons will ruin some of the finest scenery in
Scotland, pose a hazard to health and damage the local economy.
They will also contend that Northern Ireland Electricity has cheaper
alternatives to importing power from Scotland.
The inquiry will consider the environmental arguments, and examine the need
for the interconnector and its consequences for the national and local
economy.
Northern Ireland Electricity believes that the interconnector is the best
solution for meeting its projected shortfall in power after 1997.
Scottish Power sees the project as a way of increasing output and maximising
utilisation of its coal-burning power stations. It will argue that the
project should thus benefit the Scottish economy, especially by providing
increased demand for coal from the Scottish coalfield, shortly to be
privatised.
The interconnector would involve building more than 200 pylons from a site
near Ayr to Ballantrae in south-west Ayrshire. There will also be a cable
across the Irish Sea.
Kyle and Carrick district council, across which the pylons would run, is one
the leading objectors. However, a consultants' report commissioned by the
council concluded that the project would bring substantial economic benefits
to Scotland and was the only way to meet Northern Ireland's power shortfall.
The government is not obliged to adopt special precautions under European
law to safeguard children from exposure to possible health risks from new
underground power cables, two High Court judges ruled yesterday.
Three children from London, acting through their fathers, applied for court
orders requiring Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to
fulfil his duty to protect the public and direct the National Grid to ensure
that fields from new cables do not exceed levels which latest research
suggests are safe.
The children live in South Woodford, where National Grid is laying a
high-voltage underground cable. Their parents fear dangerous electromagnetic
fields could increase the risk of childhood leukaemia and other cancers.
Their lawyers argued that changes in European law required member states to
act on 'precautionary' principles when carrying out legal duties. But Lord
Justice Farquharson and Mrs Justice Smith refused their application for
judicial review.
The parents are considering an appeal to the Court of Appeal and then, if
still unsuccessful, taking their case to the European Court of Justice.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Rating move warning to companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Companies whose properties have dropped in value since the last business
rates revaluation in 1990 will not immediately receive the full benefit in
reduced rates after next year's revaluation, the Department of the
Environment announced yesterday.
The transitional scheme for introducing the new valuations will also put a
ceiling on the amount by which companies' rates can increase. This will be
fixed at 20 per cent for large properties, and 15 per cent for smaller
properties. These limits will stay in force for the next five years.
The government has not ruled out meeting some of the costs from public
funds, but said that 'in the present climate of economic recovery' it was
'reasonable that ratepayers who stand to gain substantially from the changes
should meet the costs of protecting those who face large increases'.
Mr David Curry, the local government minister, pointed out that many of the
'gainers' from next year's revaluation were still receiving help from 1990's
transitional scheme.
He added: 'We fully accept that, because of the way the economy has moved in
different parts of the country, the 1995 rates revaluation will give a very
different picture to that which emerged from the 1990 revaluation.'
The Confederation of British Industry welcomed the government's decision to
buffer rates increases and to give extra protection to small businesses. But
it said: 'We would not want the winners this time around to have to face
lengthy delays before seeing the gains.'
The revaluation has not yet been completed, but the government said
businesses in London and the south-east are most likely to benefit from it.
Companies in the Midlands and the north of England could see the greatest
rises.

FT  04 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Row over minimum wage defused
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A row over Labour's commitment to a national minimum wage was defused
yesterday when it was agreed that the party's Economic Commission, chaired
by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, would draw up details of the
policy.
Tension between the unions and the party leadership on employment law was
set aside with the adoption of motions calling for increased rights at work,
while a radical motion calling for the repeal of all Conservative union
legislation seems likely to be rejected on a card vote.
On the minimum wage, the conference backed a motion calling for a target for
the low-paid based on half median male earnings. But officials said the
commission would prepare proposals on the commitment to be approved at a
future conference.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union and a member of
the Economic Commission, accused the media of 'mischief-making nonsense' in
suggesting there were differences of view between the unions and the
leadership over the minimum wage. He said: 'We seem to be picking over each
word. In the end it is a matter of trust.'
Mr Tony Blair insisted the minimum wage must be introduced 'flexibly and
sensibly' and not 'foolishly'.
Interviewed last night on the BBC's Panorama programme, Mr Blair said: 'If
we do it foolishly, and some countries have done it foolishly, then it could
have an adverse impact. So we will do it sensibly.'
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said Labour would have
to consider ways of phasing in the minimum wage 'step by step'.
Mr Brown denied the party was split over the minimum wage but refused to
accept that Labour should commit itself for the time being to a precise
figure.
However Mr Garfield Davies, general secretary of the Usdaw shopworkers'
union, stressed that a clear formula and a clear figure would have to be
agreed well before the next election. 'We must have a clear figure so the
millions of low-paid workers will be able to see how their wages will be
improved,' he said.
Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, received
loud applause from a minority of delegates when he called for the repeal of
all Conservative legislation and attacked Mr Blair for his 'lukewarm'
support for the rail signallers' strike.
The main motion on rights at work called for the right to individual and
collective representation by unions and a legal right to strike.
However Mr Peter Mandelson, a leading party moderniser close to Mr Blair,
said at a fringe meeting that legislation alone will not help unions.
He said: 'They have got to modernise themselves and make themselves more
attractive to potential members. That is the only way they can improve their
standing.'
He also said that last year's one-member, one-vote reform was only the first
step. He added that the important next step was to increase individual
membership among union members.

FT  04 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Leaders set to back shake-up
of benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour leadership is preparing to back a radical shake-up of the benefit
system for the unemployed and low-paid alongside the full integration of the
tax and benefits system for the retired.
Anticipating a report in two weeks' time from the party's Social Justice
Commission, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, and Mr Donald Dewar,
social security spokesman, indicated that a future Labour government would
preserve the principle of universal child benefit and the state pension.
But the leadership is keeping open the option - raised in the commission's
report - of extending the taxation of universal benefits.
It is understood that a large part of the commission's recommendations focus
on ways to remove poverty traps which discourage the unemployed from taking
part-time or low-paid jobs.
The focus on improving what are known as 'in-work benefits' is in line with
Mr Tony Blair's insistence that Labour's approach to the welfare state will
be to encourage self-help rather than dependency on state benefits.
Mr Dewar underlined the point by telling the conference that Labour's aim
was 'a nation at work, not a nation on benefit'. He also underlined the
party's support for the social insurance principle embodied in the present
system of National Insurance contributions.
The commission's report articulates concern that the present system of
rapidly withdrawing cash from low-income households when one member takes
any form of employment discourages those on benefits from seeking work.
Among those are women who are forced to give up part-time work when their
partners become unemployed to prevent the family's benefits being withdrawn.
Unemployed men are also discouraged from part-time work by the structure of
income-support payments.
One suggestion is that benefit payments should include a 'guaranteed'
element which the unemployed would be allowed to keep if they took part-time
or low-paid jobs. Another possibility would be to allow the jobless to keep
all of their unemployment benefits for a limited period.
The plan to integrate the tax and benefits system for pensioners aims to
give a guaranteed minimum income for the retired while scrapping
means-testing for poor pensioners. About 2m are eligible for some form of
income support but about a quarter do not claim.
Mr Dewar said the aim was 'to help pensioners living in poverty without
leaving them exposed to the crude means-test which is income support'.
But an automatic 'top-up' of state pensions for the poor would allow Labour
to drop the expensive pledge given at the last election to restore the link
between the state pension and earnings. Only a small part of the money would
be needed to raise the incomes of the poorest pensioners.
Because most pensioners have stable financial circumstances, the assumption
is that the majority would have to complete only one new tax and benefit
return during retirement. Those with changing incomes would be subject to
regular assessments.

FT  04 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Cook renews attack on Archer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Archer, former deputy chairman of the Tory party, came under fire from
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, and Mr Gordon Brown,
shadow chancellor, when they renewed their attack on government 'sleaze'.
Both highlighted the involvement of the peer and millionaire author in share
transactions which were investigated by inspectors of the Department of
Trade and Industry after allegations of insider dealing.
Mr Cook recalled that Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary, had decided that no action would be taken against Lord Archer.
He claimed that the share purchases arranged by Lord Archer had given rise
to profits in five days 'from speculation' which were more than most workers
in Mr Cook's Livingston constituency made in five years.
Mr Cook said: 'I can think of no clearer way in which Conservatives believe
that you can make money without making goods.'
Mr Brown said Lord Archer had lost his 'appeal' to the hierarchy of the
Conservative party, and would not be attending its conference at Bournemouth
next week.
'What are we to think of a public figure who collects thousands of pounds
for a friend from a television station and hands out thousands of pounds to
a friend at a railway station?' he said.
Mr Brown was apparently referring to the 1986 incident when Lord Archer sent
Pounds 2,000 via an intermediary to a prostitute, Monica Coghlan, at a
railway station, to help her escape from hounding reporters. Lord Archer won
Pounds 500,000 damages in a 1987 libel case against a newspaper which
suggested that the gift was intended to stop her revealing that he had slept
with her.

The conference yesterday called for a wholesale review of the Child Support
Agency to make it more responsive to families' needs.
Mr James Taylor of the Society of Labour Lawyers said the agency - set up to
ensure absent parents paid child maintenance - had failed those it was
designed to help, the children of lone parents. He said they were in many
cases worse off because of the inflexibility of the agency's operation.

Curbs on drug companies' profits were envisaged by Ms Dawn Primarolo, shadow
health minister, during a fringe meeting.
She said a joint team from the ministries of trade and industry and health
would produce a policy document aimed at preventing the NHS being 'ripped
off'.
Attacking the existing voluntary scheme for regulating prices, she said it
enabled pharmaceutical companies to secure a return on investment second
only to that obtained by armament manufacturers. A price regime was needed
which was 'democratised'. Ms Primarolo acknowledged, however, the need for
spending on research and development.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, confirmed that reform of health
service trusts would initially involve the removal of members not
sympathetic to Labour's approach.

FT  04 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: US to be lobbied on aircraft
job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union officials plan to visit the US to try to persuade President Clinton to
help save almost 1,000 aerospace jobs, Roland Rudd writes.
The jobs will be lost at the Raytheon aircraft plants in Broughton near
Chester and Hatfield, Hertfordshire, when work is moved to Arkansas.
The company bought the corporate jets business from British Aerospace a year
ago but has decided to switch production to its US base to save money.
Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU engineering union, said: 'It is my
intention to contact the president to stress to him what a devastating blow
this relocation will be to communities of skilled people in the UK. It is
asset-stripping of the worst kind.'
The closures were raised at the conference yesterday when the government was
urged to intervene to help save the jobs.
Mr Jack Dromey, national secretary of the TGWU general union, referring to
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, asked: 'Where was the
man who promised to intervene before every meal? The silence was deafening.'
Mr John Weakley, an executive council member of the AEEU, said 4,000 workers
depended on Raytheon. 'Closure would be a further hammer blow for areas
already suffering the harsh effects of massive job cuts in the aerospace
sector,'
Union leaders urged Mr Heseltine, to intervene to reverse the 'catastrophic'
closure proposals.

FT  04 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Leftwingers capture two NEC
seats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two leftwingers were unexpectedly elected to Labour's ruling national
executive committee yesterday in a setback to Mr Tony Blair's drive to
modernise the party.
In elections for seven constituency representatives - the first under
one-member-one-vote rules - Mr Dennis Skinner and Ms Diane Abbott were
elected in fifth and last places.
Ms Abbott, the MP for Hackney North, was elected - after failing to win
enough votes for outright election - under a rule requiring two members of
the constituency section to be women.
However, in a demonstration of the left's continuing ability to mobilise
activists' votes, the highest-scoring loser was Mr Ken Livingstone, the
leftwing MP for Brent East.
Mr Skinner, the veteran MP for Bolsover, returns to the national executive a
year after being voted off with Mr Tony Benn, the MP for Chesterfield, at
the low-water mark of leftwing influence.
The results are an embarrassment to the modernising Labour leaders around Mr
Blair, who had hoped that three vacant constituency section places would be
filled by sympathisers.
Mr Jack Straw, MP for Blackburn, and Mr Blair's leadership campaign manager,
was the only modernist candidate elected. Ms Mo Mowlam and Mr Chris Smith,
shadow cabinet supporters of Mr Blair, both scored fewer votes than Ms
Abbott.
Mr Livingstone said the election results were a warning to Mr Blair to
recognise the substantial level of rank-and-file support for leftwing
policies.
Mr Blair's friends said the election would make little difference to the
political balance of the national executive, which remains largely
supportive of the leadership.
They pointed to strong support for two sitting allies of Mr Blair - Mr
Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, and Ms Harriet Harman, shadow Treasury
chief secretary - as evidence of backing for modernisation.
The leftwing tide did not extend to the trade-union section, which elects 12
members to the national executive. Mr Arthur Scargill, the mineworkers'
leader, was cheered during an attack on the leadership, but finished third
from bottom of the poll with fewer than half the votes needed for election.
However, the elections, combined with the re-emergence of the union block
vote in spite of its abolition last year, fuelled fears among modernisers
that the left might regain control of the national executive unless Labour's
constitution is reformed.
The Labour co-ordinating committee, a modernising pressure group, will today
call for a radical review to reduce union influence, extend individual
voting and extend national executive representation to excluded groups such
as councillors.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, topped the constituency
section poll followed by Mr David Blunkett, party chairman.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the former acting leader who left the national
executive after failing to win re-election as deputy leader, topped the poll
for five women's-section representatives.

FT  04 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Battleground of bruised egos
and shortening tempers - Neither the party leader nor the unions are in any
mood to give way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Years of retreat may have left Labour's union barons diminished figures with
bruised egos, but they remain a force at the party conference and Mr Tony
Blair cannot afford to ignore them.
Mr Bill Morris and Mr John Edmonds, general secretaries of the TGWU and GMB
general unions respectively, have already made clear this week in Blackpool
that the unions are in no mood to sit quietly on the sidelines in the 'new'
Labour party.
They may no longer be able to hold up their block vote cards to show who has
the muscle in making party policy. But they lost little time in pointing out
that this year's rule allowing union delegates to decide how they should
vote does not mean they can do as they like.
As Mr Edmonds, a former moderniser, pointed out, his delegates are mandated
to represent union policy and not their own opinions. This seems unlikely to
change as long as the unions retain a collective voice at the party
conference.
They still account for 70 per cent of the total votes, and unless Labour's
mass membership grows rapidly, they will maintain a dominant position.
Three weeks ago Mr Blair warned in forthright style at a private TUC dinner
that he would not bow to the power of the unions, restore their lost
privileges or govern in their sectional interest.
It is not the kind of language union leaders are used to hearing. Last year
John Smith signed up to their policy agenda without a qualm. Mr Blair does
not intend to do the same.
He has accepted that there must be a commitment to the aspiration of full
employment, to the introduction of a national minimum wage and to laws for
extending employees' rights at work. However he dislikes being pinned down
to the detail at this stage.
Yet this is what Mr Morris and Mr Edmonds appear to want. The GMB leader is
demanding a precise target for full employment while the TGWU general
secretary insists on a national minimum wage set at half of the median level
of male earnings.
There was a threatening tone in their speeches to the conference yesterday.
Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, deputy general secretary of the public service union
Unison, did not sound any less threatening.
There is more than an air of unease about their views on Mr Blair. Should he
be concerned about this? The Labour leader is not anti-union, but neither is
he inclined to pander to the egos of union leaders.
As an outspoken champion last year of the one-member-one-vote principle for
choosing Labour parliamentary candidates, he has no time for union special
interests.
He has every reason to believe he is more in touch with rank-and-file
workplace feelings than the union leaders. It is worth remembering that
members of 23 of the 29 unions affiliated to the party voted to elect him
leader in defiance of many union leaders.
Mr Edmonds preferred Mrs Margaret Beckett, the former deputy leader of the
party, but 56 per cent of his members voted for Mr Blair. The left-leaning
TGWU union executive urged its members to support Mrs Beckett, but Mr Blair
secured 44 per cent of their vote while only a third backed her.
In Unison, 53.5 per cent voted for Mr Blair. 'Those amazing results raise
the serious question of who the union leaders really believe they speak
for,' reflected one official. However in the conference yesterday they still
claimed to be speaking for what they called 'our people'.
Union leaders believe they are not a liability in the 'new' Labour party,
and that recent public sympathy for the striking signal workers showed how
times have changed. Some argue that Mr Blair should not turn the unions'
link with the party into a problem.
One senior union official said: 'If you keep gnawing at the union link, it
just reminds people that it exists. Blair should recognise it is a political
reality and move on.'
But most union leaders recognise they have no real alternative but to rally
behind Mr Blair. Even the most intransigent recognise that only he can
deliver a Labour victory at the next general election and possibly save them
from oblivion.

FT  04 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: GMB to press for jobs pledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, yesterday
warned the Labour leadership that he would campaign for the party to adopt a
detailed commitment to full employment by the next election.
In two speeches at the Labour conference, Mr Edmonds insisted that the party
should adopt a clear employment target and that it should be made public by
next year's conference.
He would not reveal the target he had in mind for reducing the jobless
total, but claimed that the issue of full employment would be
'make-or-break' for the party. He told delegates: 'During the next year we
need to mix some concrete in with the rhetoric, and we have to change our
attractive slogan into a hard-edged policy with the strength and substance
that people can depend on.'
Mr Edmonds' comments came as the conference passed a series of composite
resolutions committing Labour to full employment without specific targets.
The vagueness of these resolutions helped to avoid an open split on the
issue between the left and right wings of the party.
In recent weeks, Mr Tony Blair and Mr Gordon Brown have signalled that they
want to move Labour away from old-style socialist policies and that they
will not set targets for reducing unemployment.
Close aides of Mr Brown made clear yesterday that Mr Edmonds would now have
to take the battle over full employment to Labour's Economic Commission,
which will formulate the party's industrial strategy.
They were confident that only three or four members of the commission would
support Mr Edmonds and that he would be heavily outnumbered in policy
discussions.
However, the GMB leader enjoys support from several MPs in the party
including Mr Roger Berry, Mr Peter Hain and Ms Diane Abbott, who was
yesterday elected to the national executive committee.
Ms Abbott lost no time in outlining her commitment to placing employment at
the heart of the party's strategy. 'What we need to do now is put in place
the targets and put in place the programme,' she said.

FT  04 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Blunkett calls for delegates
to unite on social and economic policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Blunkett, the party chairman and shadow health secretary, called on
delegates to unite behind policies designed to achieve social justice and
economic efficiency, Ivor Owen writes.
The message sent out by the conference, he said, should confirm that Labour
under the leadership of Mr Tony Blair was 'in tune with the British people'.
Mr Blunkett looked forward to full employment and a national minimum wage
'going hand-in-hand together'. He said: 'Equity and the narrowing of the gap
between rich and poor must be our watchword.'
He also sought to reassure delegates who fear the conference's policymaking
role is being undermined. He welcomed Mr Blair's pledge to follow the
example of John Smith in providing an 'inclusive, open style' of leadership.
Mr Blunkett said this should ensure that 'all of us have a part to play' in
building the foundations for victory at the next general election. The
party's vision needed to embrace the aspirations of the middle classes and
those whose only hope for the future was the return of a Labour government.
Putting social justice and economic efficiency into action should result in
decent jobs and decent wages.
Mr Blunkett condemned the redistribution of wealth by Conservative
chancellors, which he said had been against those who could least afford it
and in favour of those making the most even when they did not deserve to do
so.

Mr Ken Cameron, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, accused the
government of 'playing with fire' and putting lives at risk through public

'We see fire stations continually being closed. We see fire engines being

Public-sector workers would no longer put up with having their wages held

FT  04 OCT 94 / World Trade News: US declines to use Super 301 weapon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday unilaterally disarmed itself of its most feared and
controversial trade expansion weapon: Super 301.
The provision of US law once required the US trade representative to name
'unfair' trading nations, list their most egregious trade practices, and,
using the threat of sanctions, negotiate them out of existence.
Apparently, Mr Mickey Kantor, the current representative, became convinced
that further unilateral action would be counterproductive. This is
particularly true since the broad 'framework' approach with Japan - the real
target of Super 301 - had finally yielded market openings in insurance,
government procurement and flat glass, announced on Saturday.
The law expired in 1990, but Mr Kantor resurrected his own milder version
last March. To reduce the stigma associated with Super 301, he said he would
list trade practices instead of unfair trading countries. Yesterday he
declined to list even those, saying they were already being negotiated in
other forums. He made clear that 'the single most important component' of US
trade strategy was the successful implemention of the Uruguay Round.
Mr Kantor did list a number of practices which he said could in the future
'warrant identification as priority foreign country practices'.
These include the EU Utilities Directive, under which the US has already
levied sanctions in response to the preference given EU suppliers in
government procurement projects of telecommunications products and
equipment.
The Super 301 law has been controversial since its introduction in 1988
trade legislation. US trading partners said it poisoned the environment for
multilateral negotiations under way in the Uruguay Round.
A study published last month by the prestigious Institute for International
Economics said the use of US unilateral trade weapons had been 'neither as
powerful a market-opening crowbar as its supporters assert nor the
unmitigated disaster for the global trading system that critics feared'.
It found that 'aggressive unilateralism' did not typically lead to trade
wars, as had been feared, nor to discrimination against third country
exporters. But it expected that Super 301 would be less effective in the
future.
President Bill Clinton promised to revive Super 301 during his election
campaign. Mr Kantor moved to institute his own version of the law when
US-Japan trade talked failed in March. This headed off introduction of a
tougher version in Congress.
As an alternative, the IIE report recommended 'aggressive multilateralism' -
making use of the dispute settlement provisions of the new World Trade
Organisation (which will come into being next year) to enforce global trade
rules. This is clearly what the administration intends, except in the case
of trade barriers not covered by the new rules.

FT  04 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Russia plans more tax on western films -
Protection sought for local industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia is threatening to impose additional duties on imported western films
and videos to help protect the country's stricken film industry and deter
video piracy. The move is likely to cause consternation among western film
producers, although they are hopeful the decision may be reconsidered.
Mr Yuri Vasyuchkov, a senior official at the state cinema committee,
yesterday said a new tax, equivalent to 350 minimum monthly salaries
(Dollars 2,700), would be imposed on imported films this month. The proceeds
of the new tax would be redistributed to Russian film studios.
'Film distributors will now have to pay fees to screen foreign films in
Russia. To some extent this will provide help to our cash-strapped film
studios,' he said.
However, some award-winning films, children's features, non-commercial
documentaries and films produced in association with Russian companies would
be exempt from the new tax, Mr Vasyuchkov said.
The proposal has already aroused the ire of western film producers and
distributors, who claim the tax would double the cost of distribution. 'It
is an absolutely ridiculous situation and we hope that they will soon see
sense,' said one film studio representative yesterday. Others suggested the
move would result in greater piracy of films.
The once-proud Russian film industry, which was accorded great importance in
the Soviet era as one of the chief instruments of propaganda, is
experiencing a drastic crisis of confidence. Cinema audiences are estimated
to have plummeted to only 10 per cent of the levels they were a decade ago.
Most of the film studios at Mosfilm, the Soviet equivalent of Hollywood, now
stand idle or are being used by independent producers to make advertisements
or pop music videos. Only four films are currently in production compared
with more than 50 a year in Mosfilm's glory days.
The growth of other forms of entertainment, such as home videos, has also
eroded the cinema's appeal, as has the squeeze on household incomes because
of the upheavals in the Russian economy.
As in eastern Europe, western companies operating in Russia have trouble
defending intellectual copyrights. Piracy of film, music, computer and book
rights is widespread.
In one recent example, Dame Barbara Cartland, the British author of prim
romantic novels, was incensed to discover that Russian editions of her books
contained erotic drawings.
Piracy is rife in the film industry. Street kiosks sell pirated copies of
western films and regional and cable television companies frequently show
copied western films. Industry estimates suggest about 64m blank video
cassettes were officially imported into Russia last year, compared with only
7,500 pre-recorded cassettes.

FT  04 OCT 94 / World Trade News: China expects sharp rise in oil imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China expects to be importing 100m tonnes of crude oil annually by early
next century, to sustain its continued rapid economic expansion.
Mr Li Boxi, a senior official of the State Development Research Centre,
forecast an explosion in demand for crude imports if China failed to bring
on stream big new fields. 'The situation can hardly change for the better if
no new big oil fields are tapped,' he was quoted as saying by the official
China Daily newspaper.
Mr Li expects China's crude imports to reach 50m tonnes by the end of the
century and 100m tonnes by the year 2010. China's planned annual average
economic growth rate is 8 per cent to the year 2000.
China, which averaged 13 per cent economic growth for the past two years,
became a net importer of crude last year, but Chinese officials are cagey
about the volume.
Mr Wang Tao, president of the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC),
said the 'export volume of crude oil was larger than imports' last year. He
did not give details. But China has been preparing for a closer oil trading
relationship with Gulf states. Mr Li Lanqing, a vice premier, visited the
Gulf last year to discuss the possibility of long-term arrangements.
China imported 15.65m tonnes of crude in 1993 and 12.8m tonnes of refined
products. Output reached 143.7m tonnes from both onshore and offshore fields
but China is struggling to maintain these production levels.
Mr Wang predicted that China's output would rise this year, but not enough
to meet rising demand.
Most of China's oilfields are mature and require substantial investment to
maintain production levels.
China is continuing to open onshore and offshore fields to foreign
explorers, but results have been disappointing. Hopes are pinned on the
Tarim basin region in the country's far west, but exploration and
development is at an early stage. Oil officials say China should cast its
net wider in the search for oil.
Last month China announced plans to invest Yn100bn in its outdated
petrochemical sector by 2000, with much of the funds coming from abroad,
including equity participation. It is negotiating investment deals with
several big oil producers and refiners, including Aramco, Saudi Arabia's
state oil company, to establish joint venture refineries. China's need for
additional refining capacity is underscored by the fact that with 20 per
cent of the world's population, it has just 3.7 per cent of world capacity
for crude oil processing.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft-making consortium, yesterday
forecast that demand from airlines would exceed 13,000 aircraft by the year
2011 and that it would win about 40 per cent of the orders. The forecast, in
the company's monthly newsletter, said demand would be strongest from North
American and Asian airlines and just over half of the orders would come from
the renewal of existing fleets.
'Of the 8,500 airliners in service at the end of 1991, 83 per cent should be
replaced by the year 2011,' the company said. Combined with traffic growth,
it airlines would need 13,400 new aircraft in the 20-year period from 1992.
The assumptions are based on average annual airline traffic growth of 5.4
per cent, with the strongest annual increase, of about 7.4 per cent, coming
in the Asia-Pacific region.
The consortium, which groups Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace of
Germany, British Aerospace and Casa of Spain, said an increasing proportion
of orders would be for large wide-bodied aircraft. 'Airlines will want
aircraft which can handle more than 500 passengers, to cut costs and boost
efficiency,' said the company.

Malaysia is considering tenders from nine consortia for one of the key
contracts at the new Kuala Lumpur international airport being built on a
greenfield site south of Kuala Lumpur. The MDollars 2bn (Dollars 780m)
contract for the main terminal and baggage handling system is the largest
single works package at the airport. Companies from South Korea, Japan,
Germany, France, the US and Saudi Arabia are among those in the various
consortia.
Malaysian officials say no British companies are involved. At one stage an
Anglo-Japanese consortium which included Balfour Beatty, Trafalgar House and
GEC had been managing the airport project and seemed likely to win a
substantial amount of the construction work. But the consortium was
disbanded after Malaysia, angered by critical reports about its leaders in
the British press, imposed a ban this year on giving government contracts to
British companies. The ban was lifted last month. The new airport, with a
total price tag of MDollars 9bn-MDollars 12bn, is at present south-east
Asia's biggest infrastructure project.

FT  04 OCT 94 / World Trade News: EU to renew Andean Pact trade benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   QUITO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union has promised to renew economic assistance and trade
benefits to the Andean Pact trade group and endorsed the economic reform and
drug fighting efforts of its member countries.
EU representatives of the Andean-European Commission, which met in Quito
last week, said the preferential tariff system offered to the four other
members of the pact - Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru - was likely to be
renewed and expanded to include Venezuela.
The special tariff regime, which exempts most exports to Europe from duties,
was first granted to the four countries four years ago to help these
countries in their fight against drug production and trafficking. Venezuela
is being included because it is part of the Andean Pact and faces similar
drug problems, according to Mr Juan Pratt, the head of the EU delegation.
The final decision by the European Council is expected before the end of the
year.
Despite open access to the European market, Andean Pact exports to the EU
have not increased or diversified over the past four years. A trade surplus
of Ecu1.3bn (Dollars 1.6bn) in 1990 turned into a deficit for the pact in
1993.
However, as trade with Europe has declined, trade within the pact has grown
substantially. Mr Mario Reyes Chavez, head of the Andean Pact Delegation,
says: 'Given our limited export potential, it is obvious that the Andean
Pact members first turned towards each other for trade. But it is time for
us to seriously look towards other trade blocks.'
The full re-integration of Peru and a final agreement over the common
external tarriff still obstructs the path towards a common customs union,
initially scheduled to go into effect earlier this year. Trade analysts
believe it will be difficult for Peru and Bolivia to conform to the
four-tiered tariff structure agreed by the other members.
Yet both Andean and European representatives acknowledged that the key to
boosting trade between the two blocs goes beyond offering tariff reductions.
Says Mr Pratt, 'An integral part of EU efforts in stimulating Andean exports
is providing technical and financial assistance.' Several 'Euro Centres'
throughout the region are to promote exports by assisting small and
medium-scale entrepreneurs, providing information on ventures or exploring
investment and trade opportunities in Europe.
Despite the European union's pledge to renew trade benefits and technical
assistance, Ecuador emerged from the meeting with none of its trade worries
resolved. EU restrictions on Latin American bananas, which affect Ecuador as
the world's largest exporter, were not discussed. As a further blow to its
diversification efforts, two weeks ago the US imposed a 50 per cent tariff
on the country's rose growing and exporting industry.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Nigeria increases prices sharply

<TEXT>
Food, fuel and transport prices rose sharply in Nigeria over the weekend,
stoking inflation already running at more than 100 per cent a year, Reuter
reports from Lagos.
The increases took most people by surprise as, breaking with past practice,
the military government gave no warning or the customary explanations that
it had to slash subsidies on fuel.
Past increases have triggered protests and strikes in Nigeria, which is a
leading oil producer and has domestic prices that are among the world's
lowest.
By yesterday there was still no official announcement that prices had been
raised. A spokeswoman for state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation said: 'We have no official statement on the matter.' She
declined to comment further, saying that no senior officials were available.
The price of a litre of petrol rocketed more than four times to 15 naira
(43p) from 3.25 naira on Sunday. The price of diesel rose to 14 naira from
3.0 naira and kerosene, the poor man's fuel, went up to 12 naira from 2.75.
Analysts said the government might be keeping silent because it was testing
people's reaction, having taken over the leadership of the unions that were
most likely to have fought the rise. General Sani Abacha, the military
ruler, sacked leaders of the oil workers unions and the labour federation in
August to end two months of strikes and protests demanding the restoration
of democracy.
Gen Abacha also appears to have broken the political opposition, many of
whose leaders are in detention.
'The last time fuel prices were increased the government was brought down,'
said a western diplomat. 'It is by no means certain that the same will
happen now.'
'Today, the trade unions are under the jackboots and can't react, at least
not immediately,' said a senior executive of an independent oil marketing
company.
Fares in different parts of the country have shot up by as much as 200 per
cent as transport operators pass the increased fuel charges on to commuters.
'I charged passengers 700 naira from Gboko (central Nigeria) to Lagos
yesterday. Today, I am asking for 2,000,' Mr Bala Alli, an intercity taxi
driver, said.
Food costs have also risen, pushing up an inflation rate already running
well above 100 per cent each year.
'How are people to survive under these circumstances?' asked a housewife at
Ketu market near Lagos after paying 50 naira for a tuber of yam which on
Friday cost 30 naira. Market traders said prices had been raised to cover
increased transport costs.
Nigeria, with a per capita income of less than Pounds 210, is one of the
poorest nations in the world despite its big crude oil production.
The country has been in turmoil since a previous military government
annulled presidential elections last year believed to have been won by Mr
Moshood Abiola, a business tycoon. Mr Abiola is in detention awaiting trail
for proclaiming himself president in defiance of the military.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Tobacco crop profits fall in third world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tobacco farmers in developing countries could be better off growing crops
such as maize, according to a report by Panos, the independent London-based
research institute.
The report challenges claims by the tobacco industry that the crop is
profitable for the third world. It says tobacco prices have fallen by 50 per
cent in real terms over the last decade, assuming annual inflation of 4 per
cent.
Last year, prices fell by about a third because of over-supply. They have
recovered this year, but the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organisation says global stocks are high, at about 85 per cent of annual
output, and expects prices to remain depressed.
At the same time, farmers face sharply increased prices for fertilisers and
pesticides. 'Falling prices plus rising costs suggest tobacco growing is a
poor prospect for the South's farmers,' says the report, published to
coincide with an international conference in Paris next week on tobacco and
health.
Over 40 developing countries export tobacco, but in only two - Malawi and
Zimbabwe - does tobacco account for more than 2.2 per cent of foreign
earnings, the report says. 'The role of tobacco exports in the economies of
developing countries needs to be kept in proportion.'
According to the International Tobacco Growers' Association, no sustainable
alternative crops would achieve the same level of earnings for most tobacco
farmers.
The Panos report says such claims are increasingly being disputed and the
search for alternatives has been given a boost by the dramatic fall in the
auction price of tobacco in Zimbabwe and Malawi last year.
In Zimbabwe, maize had become more profitable in terms of money invested and
cost less to insure than tobacco. In Bangladesh, potatoes and cotton gave
farmers bigger net profits than tobacco.
The report argues that the health and environmental costs of tobacco
production should also be taken into account. The World Health Organisation
says that 7m people will die in developing countries from smoking-related
diseases every year by 2025 if current growth in smoking continues.
Tobacco crops cause a serious loss of trees, which are cut down for fuel to
cure the tobacco, and occupy land for longer periods than alternatives such
as maize. 'In semi-arid areas, where tobacco thrives, the loss of trees can
make land more vulnerable to desertification and unfit for agriculture.'

Institute, 9 White Lion Street, London N1 9PD.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Rabin predicts treaty with Jordan by end of this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin yesterday predicted a full
Israel-Jordan peace treaty by the end of the year, and urged the electorate
to back his readiness to trade land for peace with Syria.
In a speech at the opening of the winter session of the Israeli Knesset, Mr
Rabin gave the first detailed public exposition of his position on a
possible accord with Syria, offering a 'very limited' initial withdrawal
from the Golan Heights, to be followed by a three-year trial period of
normalised relations, and then a more substantial pullout. Significantly, he
did not rule out a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan.
Indicating that the 13,000 Jewish residents of the Golan had now outlasted
their usefulness, the prime minister declared that sending Jews to settle
the Heights after their capture in the 1967 Arab-Israel war had been 'the
right act, at the right time, in the right place'. But now, he said, there
were signs that, in return for the Golan, Syria was ready for peace. 'I want
to ask you, friends on the Golan, what should we do? Shouldn't we try?'
Mr Rabin emphasised that, in contrast with Jordan, where he was hopeful of a
peace treaty by the year's end, negotiations with Damascus were still in
their earliest phases, with big gaps between the two sides' positions.
The prime minister was followed at the rostrum by Mr Benjamin Netanyahu,
leader of the main opposition Likud party, who accused the government of
abandoning cherished Zionist values by contemplating a 'selection' process
for would-be immigrants from the former Soviet Union, to weed out the
elderly and sick. Incensed, Mr Rabin denied the claim, demanded an apology
and stalked out of the hall.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Taiwan index hits second high in 2 days
</HEADLINE>

   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Taiwan stock exchange index hit a second four-year high within two
trading days yesterday, in anticipation of government support for share
prices to boost the ruling party's prospects in December's elections.
On December 3, voters will choose a provincial governor and mayors for
Taipei, the capital, and the southern port city of Kaohsiung. Previously
these were appointed posts. They will also elect the provincial assembly and
councils for each of the two cities.
Gauging by historical precedent, political imperatives, remarks by senior
officials and monetary factors, stock market analysts believe the index
could top 8,000 before the year ends.
Yesterday's close was 7,183.75 points on moderate turnover of TDollars
64.16bn (Pounds 1.56bn).
The governing Kuomintang's grip on power has slipped in successive elections
since democratisation began with the lifting of martial law in 1987.
The Democratic Progressive party, the leading opposition party, now controls
one-third of Taiwan's counties and holds nearly a third of seats in the
Legislative Yuan, the country's primary law-making body.
In recent years the policies of the KMT have moved so closely into line with
those of the opposition as to be nearly indistinguishable. KMT leadership
has all but publicly declared Taiwanese independence from China, long the
defining issue of the opposition, in an attempt to win votes.
The ruling party is expected to win polls for the provincial governorship,
largely a figurehead post, and thought likely to retain control of the
Kaohsiung mayor's office. But it is widely seen as a fait accompli that the
influential position of Taipei mayor will go to Mr Chen Shui-bien, the
lawyer-turned-legislator of the DPP party. Mr Chen launched his political
career defending dissidents arrested in a 1979 crackdown on opposition.
'Winning a mayoral seat would give the DPP a degree of legitimacy it did not
have before,' Mr Peter Kurz, head of Asia-Pacific research for Baring
Securities (Hong Kong), said. 'This would be the first time the DPP has
attained an administrative position of real significance.'
The stock market rallied sharply leading up to and after island-wide county
elections in November 1993.
The KMT retained control of most counties, but the DPP captured 42 per cent
of the popular vote, its best showing.
The three leading commercial banks led yesterday's gains. The banks are seen
as bellwether stocks, and often their rise marks the beginning of a rally.
'A lot of people were caught napping last year, so when the banks start to
move the fear factor sets in,' a stock analyst at a UK securities house
said.

FT  04 OCT 94 / UN report ready on Iraqi arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rolf Ekeus, the United Nations envoy, arrived in Baghdad yesterday to
assess the readiness of systems installed for the long-term monitoring of
Iraqi weapons programmes - a central condition for the eventual lifting of
the oil embargo maintained against Iraq since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
Mr Ekeus declined to say on his arrival when the monitoring systems would be
fully operational, information he is due to convey in a report to the UN
Security Council on October 10.
But UN officials in New York said they expected Mr Ekeus to declare that
systems for monitoring possible missile, chemical, nuclear and biological
weapons production to be 'provisionally operational' within a few weeks, at
which point a 'test period' of the monitoring could begin.
According to diplomats at the UN, such a report would then seriously test
the unanimity of the UN Security Council on whether to offer Iraq a definite
timetable for compliance with long-term monitoring of its weapons
programmes.
France, Russia and China have already made it clear that, if Mr Ekeus'
report is positive, they would would then argue that a 'probation period' of
six months should immediately begin to test Iraqi compliance with long-term
monitoring - after which the Security Council should discuss lifting the oil
embargo. The US and Britain, however, have made it equally clear that they
would strongly oppose setting any such a definite deadline.
UN inspectors have now installed an array of monitoring devices and prepared
detailed blueprints of factories and manufacturing operations which could
produce weapons banned under the Gulf war ceasefire resolutions. UN
officials said devices to monitor missile production and testing, including
cameras at several sites, were fully in place, that surveillance methods at
potential chemical weapons production sites were 'just starting up' and that
means for surveying possible biological weapons production were soon to be
installed.
Iraqi officials insist that they have fully met all Gulf war ceasefire
conditions and that the Security Council should respond by offering at least
some easing of the embargo once the UN monitoring programme begins any test
period. Officials warned last week that unless Mr Ekeus could offer some
such concessions, Iraq would 'explore other ways of dealing with the
Security Council'.
Whatever Mr Ekeus reports, however, there is unanimity in the Security
Council that no easing of the embargo can take place until and unless Iraq
formally recognises both the sovereignty of Kuwait and the legitimacy of
UN-demarcated borders between Iraq and its southern neighbour. 'Until they
have done this, nothing else will happen,' said a western diplomat.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Port row goes right to HK jugular: Desperately needed ninth
terminal is feared dead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hong Kong government is to accelerate development of the colony's 10th
and 11th container terminals, given fears that the desperately needed ninth
terminal is effectively dead.
Container Terminal 9 (CT9) is already 18 months behind schedule. Progress
has been mothballed by politics, with China refusing to approve the project
(which straddles the 1997 handover, and therefore requires endorsement from
Beijing) unless Jardines is ejected from the consortium developing the
terminal.
China claims that Jardines' inclusion in the consortium was a pay-off for
supporting Governor Chris Patten's democracy reforms; Hong Kong says that it
operates a level playing field for all its contracts, and that to suggest
otherwise is to damage the colony's international business reputation.
The stalemate over the terminal, allied to the lack of practical
alternatives for extending the colony's port, will spark huge problems of
congestion and bring a knock-on effect to the economy, analysts say.
Like the airport, also running at capacity and also the subject of a
Sino-British deadlock, the port row goes straight for the colony's jugular.
Hong Kong, the eighth biggest trading economy, operates the biggest port in
the world. Some 90 per cent of Hong Kong's trade passes through it.
Annual increases in throughput equal the total annual throughput at the UK's
biggest port, Felixstowe: about 1.5m containers.
Port operations contribute about 20 per cent of the colony's GDP and employ,
in the widest definition of port-related activities, some 350,000 people, or
12-15 per cent of the workforce. While year-on-year growth in throughput
stands at about 28 per cent for the year so far, capacity levels were
breached back in May. Government figures put the cost of a two-year delay on
CT9 at HKDollars 20bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in the decade following 1997. This is
at the conservative end of estimates, which range as high as HKDollars
200bn.
Current trends point to an even bigger role for the colony's port. High
economic growth in China will stimulate both export industries and imports;
greater industrialisation in the mainland will mean more goods requiring
containerisation; and China's re-entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade or its successor will promote two-way trade.
Forging ahead with CT10 and CT11 to absorb demand will do little to solve
the problems caused by the absence of progress on CT9, and will fail to meet
the immediate concerns of shippers and terminal operators.
The time lag is contrary to Hong Kong's traditional just-in-time philosophy
whereby new terminals were coming on line as soon as the existing ones
reached capacity.
This is the first time, says Mr Tony Clark, secretary of the Port
Development Board, that Hong Kong will fail to meet its targets. Moreover,
it can no longer rely on mid-stream business to carry things on.
With the Hong Kong port handling around 600,000 TEUs (20ft equivalent units)
a month, a year-on-year growth next year of 15 per cent would mean an extra
90,000 TEUs, or a third of total mid-stream business.
Mr Dennis Bray, a consultant and former civil servant, notes that the key
victim will be China trade: or, more specifically, south China trade, much
of which is Hong Kong-funded.
'I think we are in for some really serious problems next summer,' he says.
'Once terminal and mid-stream operators see people queueing, they will jack
up their prices, and only the expensive shipments will be able to afford it,
not the cheap goods from China.
'But before that happens, there will be serious congestion, with ships
hanging around the harbour at anchor, rather like a Third World port.'
The ports being developed in China are not yet capable of handling the extra
capacity. Nor does China yet have the trading infrastructure, in terms of
processing and banking services, to allow big shipments to by-pass Hong
Kong: and most such ships are loath to make two stops.
'If we get a typhoon next summer, when we cannot handle any boxes at all for
a couple of days and the jams on the roads are so colossal, then I guess
there will be some crisis action about providing more land (for existing
terminals to expand).
'It's just a pity they cannot do this earlier, because there is going to be
one almighty mess,' Mr Bray said.

<TEXT>
Rwandan refugee camps in north-east Tanzania were 'calm but tense' yesterday
and the United Nations refugee agency called for a swift end to lawlessness
in one camp in Zaire which had kept aid workers out for a fourth day, Reuter
reports from Kigali.
Three days' violence rocked the Ngara camps last week; international aid
workers said they were worried for their lives and those of refugees they
were trying to help.
The camps in Tanzania and Zaire are increasingly controlled by militamen and
troops of the former Hutu-dominated government defeated in July by the
mainly-Tutsi Rwanda Patriotic Front.
Some 800,000 Rwandan refugees are thought to be in the Goma area, with half
a million more in west Tanzania, in addition to 2m people displaced inside
Rwanda by three months of civil war and massacres.
One aid official said the Ngara camps were becoming unmanageable; some aid
agencies had reported an increasing number of Rwandans entering the camps
with guns.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Berber question returns to haunt troubled Algeria:
Kidnapping of a singer has threatened to drag a nationalist element into the
violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent kidnapping in Algeria of the Berber singer Lounes Matoub has
again raised the issue that has haunted modern Algeria - the Berber
question, or, to be more precise, the Kabyle question.
Matoub is a militant of the Berber Cultural Movement (MCB) which calls for
Berber to be treated as a 'national' language in Algeria, on a par with
Arabic, and for it to be taught in all schools.
As provocative as he is popular, Matoub recently claimed he was 'neither an
Arab nor a Moslem' and argued that the Kabylia Berber heartland, a
mountainous region 100 miles east of Algiers, should be granted autonomous
political status.
His latest record, Kenza, is dedicated to the daughter of Tahar Djaout, a
Kabyle writer and polemicist who was murdered by supporters of radical Islam
in June last year. Matoub is suspected of being held by a similar group. The
singer's publicly expressed love of whisky has turned him into what Tahar
Djaout was until his death, the man religious zealots love to hate.
On Sunday more than 100,000 people took part in a peaceful demonstration in
the Berber capital of Tizi Ouzou marked by calls and threats for the safe
return of Matoub.
The MCB plans simultaneous protests tomorrow and on Thursday in four cities,
including Algiers and Tizi Ouzou.
The original inhabitants of North Africa were Berberbut the process of
Arabisation, the adoption of Arabic language and culture, has, over 13
centuries, left only a third of the Maghreb's 60m people with Berber as
their mother tongue. Between 20 and 25 per cent of Algeria's 26m people
speak Berber, two-thirds of them coming from Kabylia.
The Kabyles played a key role in Algeria's modern history, one quite out of
proportion to their numbers.
Between the two world wars, emigrants from Kabylia formed the vast majority
of Moslem Algerian labourers in France where they founded the first Algerian
nationalist movement, L'Etoile Nord Africaine.
As trades unionists, and with the help of French Communist party members,
they became acquainted with modern ideologies and methods of resistance. The
Etoile and its post-war successor, the Party Populaire Algerien, provided
the fount of modern Algerian politics. The idea of independence for what had
been for a century three French departements came from their ranks.
During the eight bloody years of the war of independence which started in
1954, the two Berber mountainous heartlands, Kabylia and the Aures mountains
to the south, witnessed some of the worst fighting between French troops and
the armed supporters of the Front de Liberation National (FLN).
The leading ideologue of the FLN, Abane Ramdane, a Kabyle, was murdered by
some of his peers in Morocco in 1959 - an act which symbolised the events
which were to take place at independence in 1962 when those FLN leaders who
had spent most of the war years in Morocco and Tunisia usurped power from
those who had fought in the bush. This 'betrayal', as it is now seen by
many, opened a wound which has yet to be healed.
Despite the fact that Krim Belkacem, who led the talks at which France
agreed to Algerian independence, was a Kabyle, the new rulers of Algeria,
President Ahmed Ben Bella and - after he was ousted by a military coup in
1965 - Colonel Houari Boumediene, clamped down on the freedoms their
countrymen had paid such a heavy price to win. All expression of Berber
culture were forbidden and fast Arabisation imposed.
The MCB was born after riots in Tizi Ouzou in 1980 forced the new president,
Colonel Chadli Bendjedid, to grant a greater measure of freedom. Singers
such as Matoub, who had adapted old Kabyle songs to a more modern musical
form, had already become popular. Music became a key vehicle for the
expression of a culture and language whose alphabet is the old Phoenician
script but has not be commonly written for centuries.
Like most of their countrymen, the Kabyles are not of one mind. The lines
that fracture Algerian society run through Kabylia as they do through every
social group and region. After riots in 1988 broke the power of the FLN, two
parties boasting a distinct 'Kabyle' identity emerged. The Rassemblement
pour la Culture et la Democracie (RCD) traced its roots to the MCB while the
Front des Forces Socialistes (FFS) rose from the clandestinity forced on it
since its foundation in 1963.
In the first round of the elections in December 1991, the FFS did much
better than the RCD. The two leaders reacted very differently to the
annulment of the election in January 1992 and the de facto military coup
that accompanied it. Despite being deeply opposed to the ideology of the
Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which looked set to win the election, the FFS
leader Mr Hocine Ait Ahmed opposed the suspension and argued that democracy
could only be won on the ground.
The RCD leader, Mr Said Sadi, whose links with certain military commanders
was an open secret, backed the coup. On learning of the 47.3 per cent share
of the vote the FIS had picked up in the first round, against the RCD's
meagre 2.9 per cent, he confessed to not understanding the country he lived
in. For a while he was a firm advocate of 'eradicating' fundamentalism.
The Christian schools set up in Kabylia by the French in the late 19th
century and, later on, emigration to France, gave Kabyle Berbers a training
in the ways of the modern world and gave rise to a more literate people than
any other social group in Algeria.
Many Kabyle Berbers still support the FIS, one of whose most renowned
military commanders, Mohamedi Said, is Kabyle. The man who was responsible
for setting the FIS on a solid financial footing, until he 'deserted' the
movement for the ranks of the nomenklatura in June 1991, Ahmed Merani, is
Kabyle. One of the no-go areas which the army has lost control of in recent
months is the mountains between the ports of Jijel and Collo, part of the
so-called 'Corniche Kabyle'.
Be they 'Arab' or 'Berber', most Algerians feel insulted by Kabyle Berbers
claiming they are 'not Moslem'. They are also fearful that such statements
are conducive to confrontation rather than dialogue, a form of politics
desperately lacking in Algeria. Attempts by the FIS and the military to
'cleanse' the country of each other have already cost 28,000 lives.

THE BERBER PROTEST CONTINUES
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
The language issue
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -Ancestors of the indigenous peoples of North Africa, the Berbers were
  in Algeria centuries before the area became a Roman province in 106
  BC, to be followed by the Arab conquest of the late 7th century, the
  Ottoman takeover in the mid-16th and French colonisation in the
  mid-19th. Algerian independence was won in 1962.
 -Algeria's official language is now Arab (about 75 per cent of the 26m
  population speak it), and, although French remains widely used, 20-25
  per cent of the country's population still consider Berber to be their
  first language, French the second and Arab only the third.
 -'The Algerian authorities deny this is a serious difficulty because
  Berber is not a written language,' writes Peter Mansfield in his book
  The Arabs. 'As the minister of information and culture, Mr Ahmad
  Taleb, remarked in 1972: 'It is wrong to say that Algeria is made up
  of Arabs and Berbers. . . The Algerian people is an Arab-Berber people
  whose culture is Arab.'

FT  04 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank in Madrid: World Bank urges mixed pension
policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A World Bank report yesterday urged governments to adopt pension policies
where the burden for providing security for an increasingly ageing global
population (see graph above) is shared by the public and private sectors,
mixing mandatory and voluntary schemes.
Warning that old-age security systems are in trouble worldwide, the report
also called on governments to lift constraints on foreign investments by
national pension funds in order to diversify risk and gain higher returns.
The report stressed the 'ageing problem' had spread quickly to developing
countries where the impact of declining fertility and increased longevity
has allowed populations to age faster than in traditional industrial
societies.
It took more than 100 years for Belgium to register a doubling, from 9 per
cent to 18 per cent, of its over-60s population. The same transition will
take just 34 years in China, according to present forecasts and 22 in
Venezuela. In 1990 almost half a billion people, slightly more than 9 per
cent of the world's population, were over 60 years old and by 2030 the
number will have tripled to 1.4bn.
The report argues against 'single pillar' pension schemes in which publicly
managed funds,financed out of payroll taxes on a pay-as-you-go basis,
provide earnings-related benefits to the aged. It says they neither protect
pensions savings nor adequately redistribute them.
The high contribution rate, a feature common to 'single pillar' systems, is
often seen as a tax to be evaded and not as a price for services received.
Such schemes tend to distort local economies and reduce growth, mainly in
countries with limited tax enforcement powers, imperfect labour markets and
large informal sectors.
The World Bank suggests a 'multi-pillar' system in which there would be a
publicly managed and tax-financed 'pillar' that would have the limited
object of alleviating old-age poverty, possibly using means-tested
programmes; a second mandatory 'pillar', based either on personal savings
accounts or occupational plans, that would be fully funded and privately
managed; and a third voluntary 'pillar' for those wishing additional
protection.
The advantage for the ageing of the three-pronged approach is that it would
concentrate the redistributive features of a public pension scheme on the
first 'pillar', allocate its savings role to the second and allow for extra
savings through the third.
The 'multi-pillar' system would improve the insurance feature of national
pension schemes by diversifying their risk.

FT  04 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank in Madrid: Russia fails to achieve its
mission - Moscow faces the unknown as opposition grows to its loan
requirements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Russia has failed to achieve a significant part of what it hoped to get from
the International Monetary Fund in Madrid - but the biggest disappointments
may still lie ahead.
In making an argument for substantially increasing both IMF borrowing and
postponing debt payments, Russia has run up against both the resentment of
the third world countries - which have seen Russia being made a special case
by the IMF and the World Bank while they languish - and the scepticism of
powerful members of the Group of Seven.
The G7 now insists on greater commitment to, and evidence of, radical reform
on Russia's part before it approves extra expenditure.
Russia had wanted an increase in its ability to borrow; a standby facility
enlarged from Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) to more than Dollars 5bn, and
access to a third tranche of the systemic transformation facility, under
which it has already borrowed Dollars 3bn in two equal parts.
It has been rebuffed on the second of these - as it seems to have been on an
as yet unpublicised plan put forward by Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy
prime minister for the economy, to 're-adjust' the Dollars 80bn debt burden
which will be due for discussion after the detailed negotiations with the
IMF later this month.
The push for extra funds already appears to have claimed a victim. According
to Russian media reports, Mr Konstantin Kagalovsky, the Russian executive
director of the IMF, has resigned (effective January 1 next year) - possibly
to be replaced by Mr Dmitri Tulin, presently a vice-chairman of the Russian
central bank.
Mr Kagalovsky, whose tenure at the bank has been under attack from within
the Russian government for some time, was the strongest advocate of an
expanded lending programme. He appears to have paid the price for its not
coming through. However, Russia's biggest test is yet to come. The debate in
Madrid is about how much could be on offer: negotiations between Russian and
IMF officials later this month will determine how much will be on offer.
Just as the IMF delegates were gathering in Madrid, Russian reform was
fraying. The rouble plunged; and at the same time it became clear - in part
because Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister, clarified it - that the
government had for the past six months been much more lax in issuing credits
than they had wished to be known. In July and August, for example, they had
issued some Rbs13,00bn of credits to cope with the expenses of the harvest
and the provisioning of the northern territories.
This laxity is coming home to roost. Already September's inflation is
reckoned to have come out at around 8 per cent, double that of August's (the
year's lowest). If the rouble continues to fall (it dropped a further 10
points yesterday) it will put more pressure on the inflation rate and the
Russian central bank would be unable to stop it without wasting its slender
reserves (of around Dollars 4.5bn).
In recent talks, the IMF has been pressing the Russian government to attempt
to reach an inflation rate of 1 per cent a month by the end of next year or
the beginning of 1996, while Russian ministers and officials have been
arguing for what is in their view a more realistic 3 per cent.
Further, the IMF will certainly insist on a more interventionist role in the
budget in return for a standby facility of Dollars 4-Dollars 5bn  -
specifying, for example, cuts in particular subsidies such as those to the
coal industry or to agriculture, rather than acquiescing in simple
across-the-board sequestrations which have left millions of workers without
pay and cut down haphazardly on investment; the useful and the useless
alike.
For the past year, Russia has had a reform which if not pain-free, has
certainly been less painful than expected. Official unemployment has
remained low: the real standard of living has, on most figures, gone up and
inflation has steadily come down - even as the budget deficit was seen to
stay within the IMF limits of under 10 per cent of GNP.
Now, that miraculous time appears to be over - and the rouble exchange rate
is the most vivid outward sign of it.
Either real cuts are made in the structure of subsidies and industrial
production is reshaped - or, say IMF officials, new borrowing will be at
risk. Mr Ernesto Hernandez-Cata, deputy head of the Europe II department
which deals with the former communist states and who is the most experienced
negotiator with the Russian government, said in Madrid over the weekend: 'We
consider a more radical approach deserves the maximum consideration on our
part.'
This means that a less radical approach will attract minimum consideration -
perhaps none.
The message from Madrid is that the world cares less about Russia and is
less well disposed towards it than many in its government had thought. Is it
ready to heed that message and tighten the belt again? Or can it no longer
do so?

FT  04 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank in Madrid: Gatt says Uruguay Round worth
Dollars 500bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) has upgraded its forecasts
for the economic benefits of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation
agreements, Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director general, said yesterday.
Mr Sutherland, who was in Madrid for the annual meetings of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank, said that global income in 2005
might be more than Dollars 500bn (Pounds 316.4bn) higher than it would have
been without the market opening measures agreed in the Uruguay Round. That
compares with earlier Gatt estimates of a Dollars 235bn income gain.
He said the upgrading was the result of work on a new economic model that
sought to capture some of the competition enhancing effects of trade
liberalisation and the opportunities that it would offer for spreading fixed
costs over larger markets.
Even so, the estimates of benefits from the Uruguay Round might be on the
low side, because they did not take account of such lasting beneficial
effects as increased investment, accelerated economic growth and a healthier
climate for research and development and the development of new products.
Mr Sutherland said the Gatt secretariat estimated that, over time, the
merchandise trade volume of the 25 industrialised countries of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development would be between 7
per cent and 8 per cent above what it would have been without the Uruguay
Round. Developing countries are expected to secure a greater expansion of
trade with Gatt's most conservative estimates showing a 14 per cent
expansion in their trade.
The Gatt secretary general said he was now more optimistic than before about
the outlook for ratification of the Uruguay Round and the eventual creation
of the World Trade Organisation, the successor to Gatt, by the beginning of
next year.
Altogether 27 governments have signed and ratified the WTO agreement and
around 50 governments have said they expect to have completed domestic
ratification procedures by the time of the WTO implementation conference in
December. He was encouraged about the progress of ratification in the US
where, he said, Congress had clarified its procedural intentions in a
positive manner.
However, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, warned in his speech to the
joint IMF-World Bank development committee that some of the beneficial
effects of the Uruguay Round could be undone through 'backdoor
protectionism'. Attempts to impose labour standards by trade sanctions were
not, for example, the solution to the problem of establishing human rights
at the work place.
Reviewing industrial country policies towards the third world, the UK
chancellor said that it was necessary to have more effective action on debt,
more effective and leaner international organisations, a sharper focus on
results and more determined action on population growth. He said there was a
need to improve the design and implementation of policies and programmes to
provide more effective assistance on the ground.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Shirtless and in shanties, Brazil votes in fair order
</HEADLINE>

   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday was just another day in Brazil, with a power cut in the capital
Braslia, shoot-outs in Rio de Janeiro and fraud allegations in the country's
impoverished north-east.
It was also the day when Brazil held its biggest set of elections in 40
years and, despite these and other problems, electoral authorities agreed
voting was fair and more orderly than expected.
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso - the former finance minister who, exit polls
suggested, will be Brazil's next president - said the elections had been
more 'ethical' and the campaign less radical than previous ones. After
voting in Sao Paulo, he managed to throw off a pack of journalists and was
thought to be resting outside the city.
Besides choosing a new president, Brazil's 95m voters were electing state
governors, two thirds of the federal Senate, all the House of
Representatives, and all state legislators.
Despite the excitement, voting was reported to be orderly throughout the
country, helped by new rules which banned late campaigning at polling
centres. One less effective rule was meant to ban people from voting
shirtless or in swimwear. This prompted complaints from people going to vote
from the beach.
In the north-eastern state of Alagoas, voting was delayed in four districts
following allegations of electoral fraud. In the southern city of Curitiba,
one man seemed to be taking politics too seriously when he shot another
voter in the queue.
Mr Cardoso said Brazil's priority was 'an end to social injustice'. Other
presidential hopefuls have pledged to bridge the country's huge divide
between rich and poor. But none of the 12,000 candidates running for various
offices visited the shantytown near Vila Clara on the outskirts of Sao
Paulo.
It was built in the last five years alongside one of the city's busiest
highways. Its wooden huts are home to more than 50 families who have no
running water or sewers.
Marinalva, a mother of two, said politicians had never helped the community.
Instead, many families fear that local politicians have been waiting until
after the elections before clearing the area.
Cars returning to Sao Paulo from Vila Clara have to travel some distance
before they suddenly encounter a snow-storm of election paper, which
continues until the main Avenue Paulista, as though voters only matter in
the city centre.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Espy to quit Clinton cabinet at year-end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mike Espy yesterday said that he would resign as US agriculture
secretary, after charges of misusing government funds and improperly
accepting gifts from farm businesses under his authority.
The cabinet member, who was one of President Bill Clinton's closest allies
in the south during the 1992 presidential election campaign, has been under
investigation by the Office of Government Ethics, which was expected to
complete its report this week, and by a special counsel.
At a news conference yesterday, Mr Espy said he was resigning with effect
from December 31, 'to overcome the challenge to my good name'.
Mr Clinton said in a statement that he regretted the resignation but said it
was 'appropriate.' He added: 'Although Secretary Espy has said he has done
nothing wrong, I am troubled by the appearance of some of these incidents'.
The president praised Mr Espy's service at the agriculture department, but
said that, for the rest of his tenure, the secretary would make no decisions
on meat and poultry inspection.
Mr Espy is only the second person to quit Mr Clinton's cabinet. Mr Les Aspin
resigned last year as defence secretary amid doubts over his decisiveness
and his handling of the US involvement in Somalia.
But Mr Clinton has been dogged, like other recent presidents, by allegations
of conflicts of interest. Most of these have touched questions about his own
involvement, through his investment in the Whitewater property venture, in
the failure of the Madison Guaranty savings and loan.
Mr Espy used to be a high-flying member of the Democratic Leadership
council, a centrist grouping which provided much of the early intellectual
underpinning of Mr Clinton's campaign.
When elected to Congress in 1986, aged 32, Mr Espy was the first black
congressman from Mississippi since the Reconstruction period immediately
after the Civil War.
He has been accused of accepting air trips and sports tickets from
businesses with interests in his department's work, such as Tyson Foods, the
Arkansas poultry group, or California's Sun Diamond Growers.

FT  04 OCT 94 / US indicator points to strong growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Evidence that the US economy is still expanding strongly came yesterday when
the National Association of Purchasing Managers said that its index had
risen from 56.2 per cent in August to 58.2 per cent in September.
Mr Ralph Kauffman, head of procurement and materials management at Oryx
Energy and chairman of the association's survey committee, said that on past
experience an index level of 58.2 per cent, if it were sustained, would be
consistent with an overall growth rate of around 4.9 per cent. The survey of
purchasing managers also showed that almost all sectors of manufacturing
industry were having to pay higher prices for their raw materials.
Release of the economic indicator fuelled fears that the US economy was
still growing faster than it could sustain without provoking a surge in
inflation. Treasury bonds fell quickly. The dollar also slid against most
major currencies before recovering to close slightly higher on the day.
Mr Kauffman said the NAPM's production index improved from 58.1 per cent in
August to 61.2 per cent in September. The new orders index rose from 60.7
per cent to 61.6 per cent.
The NAPM's price index rose from 74.5 per cent in August to 77.1 per cent in
September, its highest level for six years.

US forces in Haiti yesterday stormed the headquarters of Fraph, the
nationalist paramilitary faction loyal to the army government, as the US
took the initiative on Haiti's political stability, reports James Harding in
Washington.
The attempt to neutralise the Fraph, which killed at least five people at a
pro-democracy march last Friday, was the first instance of the more
aggressive US policy to disarm those Haitians thought to be trying to stop
the restoration of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
After US soldiers had raided the offices of Fraph in downtown Port-au-Prince
and put a tank outside the building, a crowd of Aristide supporters gathered
outside.
The raid will be seen as a response to criticisms that the US forces were
failing to guarantee free political expression.

The Mexican Congress has moved to strip immunity from its member implicated
by the attorney-general's office in the assassination last week of Mr Jose
Francisco Ruiz Massieu, who was the number two official in the governing
party, the PRI, Damian Fraser writes in Mexico City.
The Congress said that it would lift the parliamentary immunity of Mr Manuel
Munoz Rocha, a PRI congressman from the north-eastern state of Tamaulipas.
The attorney-general's office is ready to charge Mr Munoz with having
masterminded the assassination.
Investigators said they had been told by an accomplice to the assassination
that Mr Munoz and Mr Rubio Canales, a former colleague of Mr Ruiz Massieu
who is now in prison, had plotted the murder so as to slow political reform
in the country, to settle an old score with an enemy, and to weaken the
government's battle against drug traffickers.
Financial markets in Mexico were rattled by the accounts of an alliance
between drug traffickers and political reactionaries willing to kill
reform-minded politicians. The Mexico City stock market yesterday finished
2.2 per cent lower than the Friday close.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil yesterday held its biggest round of elections in 40 years, with
last-minute opinion polls predicting that Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a
sociology professor turned social democratic politician, was set to become
the country's next president.
Three opinion polls, conducted at the weekend and released yesterday, showed
him with a big lead over his nearest rival, Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of
the left-wing Workers' Party. According to the largest poll, by Datafolha,
Mr Cardoso was to win 48 per cent of the vote against Mr da Silva's 22 per
cent.
It also suggested Mr Cardoso had a lead of nine percentage points over all
the other candidates combined. If he does take more votes than all his
rivals, he will win the presidency without the need for a second round next
month.
Mr Cardoso was cheered by supporters when he left his Sao Paulo home to vote
early yesterday. He said he felt 'very emotional' amid the excitement.
Advisers said he would wait until Wednesday before commenting on the
results.
Also yesterday, Brazil was electing state governors, two thirds of the
federal senate, and all seats in the federal House of Representatives and
state legislatures.
Voting is compulsory and big queues were expected at polling stations as
nearly 95m Brazilians, including 8.5m illiterates, chose among 12,000
candidates.
Electoral authorities expect to need 10-15 days to count the votes. The
first results, probably from urban areas of Sao Paulo state, were not
expected until this afternoon at the earliest.
Mr da Silva, who led in opinion polls until July, said he remained confident
that there would be a second round. He described the election as
'illegitimate' because of the support Mr Cardoso has received from the
government.
The latter, who resigned as finance minister this year to seek the
presidency, is the man most closely linked with Brazil's new currency, the
Real, which has led to a sharp fall in inflation.
Mr da Silva also repeated accusations that Mr Cardoso's party had
distributed false ballot papers in which Mr da Silva's name appeared in the
wrong place. The left-winger candidate suggested these papers were designed
to confuse illiterate voters.
The elections were generally reported to have been peaceful. However, in the
north-eastern state of Alagoas, where nearly half the state's electoral
judges are under police protection after receiving threats, early reports
suggested voting had been delayed in four districts after allegations of
electoral fraud.

FT  04 OCT 94 / New Supreme Court faces watershed cases
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The second youngest US Supreme Court this century opened its autumn term
yesterday with a case load light even by recent standards, but including
some important political, social and business-related judgments.
Probably the most widely watched ruling will centre on the constitutionality
of imposing term limits on members of Congress. At issue is the opinion of
the Arkansas Supreme Court which invalidated a 1992 state referendum
imposing limits on congressional representatives while upholding them for
elected state officials.
Article one of the US constitution stipulates age, citizenship and residency
requirements for members of congress. The Supreme Court must decide whether
additional requirements may be added, such as ceilings on the number of
years that may be served, with little legal precedent as a guide.
Term limits are a populist cause and 15 states have adopted variations on
them since 1990 for local officials. Were the Supreme Court to find them
unconstitutional at the congressional level, the Republican party is likely
to press even harder for a constitutional amendment making them mandatory.
The Court will also hear arguments on a number of desegregation,
discrimination and congressional redistricting cases. But the most
politically controversial ruling, already exciting the gun lobby and its
opponents, stems from a clause in the 1990 Crime Control Act prohibiting the
knowing possession of a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school. A federal
appeals court ruled that this provision interfered with commerce and should,
in any case, be a matter of local not federal jurisdiction.
No far-reaching business cases appear on the Court docket, with the possible
exception of Bentsen vs Coors Brewing, which involves commercial free
speech. The government is seeking to uphold a 1935 Prohibition-era ban on
brewers advertising the strength of their product, unless state law requires
the information be placed on bottles and cans.
The Court will also determine a longstanding dispute between the banking and
insurance industries rule over whether banks may act as agents or brokers in
selling annuities to their customers. At issue is whether annuity contracts
constitute 'insurance' under the terms of the National Banking Act.
Among judgments held over from the summer but announced yesterday, the bench
refused to overrule a lower court ruling setting aside civil racketeering
charges against Mr Michael Milken, the convicted financier.
The policies of the new court are not easy to discern in advance beyond the
presumption that its consensus-seeking centre has been strengthened by the
arrival of Justice Stephen Breyer. The retirement of Justice Harry Blackmun
leaves only Justice John Paul Stevens as a classic liberal, but the
conservative flank also appears more marginalised, with only Chief Justice
William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas
consistently in the right-wing corner.
The arrival of Justice Breyer, 56, brings the average age of the nine member
bench down to 60, the youngest in over 50 years. The Chief Justice, who was
70 last Saturday, is the longest serving member.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Bonds, dollar fall on US inflation fears
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Financial markets took fright again yesterday as another economic indicator
fuelled fears that the US economy was still growing faster than it could
sustain without provoking a surge in inflation.
The National Association of Purchasing Managers said its index rose from
56.2 per cent in August to 58.2 per cent in September, a level that usually
indicates a strongly expanding economy.
Mr Ralph Kauffman, head of procurement and materials management at Oryx
Energy and chairman of the association's survey committee, said that on past
experience an index level of 58.2 per cent, if it were sustained, would be
consistent with an overall growth rate of around 4.9 per cent.
The survey of purchasing managers also showed that almost all sectors of
manufacturing industry were having to pay higher prices for their raw
materials.
Treasury bonds fell quickly in response to the NAPM results, and the dollar
also slid against most major currencies.
Many dealers believe the Federal Reserve has already been too slow to raise
interest rates to choke off the expansion to a growth rate below 2.5 per
cent, which the economy could absorb without succumbing to faster inflation.
Among professional economists, however, more are inclined to believe that
the Fed, by raising short term interest rates by 1 3/4 percentage points so
far this year, has already done enough to engineer a 'soft landing,'
steering the economy back to a sustainable pace of growth.
Mr Kauffman said the NAPM's production index improved from 58.1 per cent in
august to 61.2 per cent in September, while the new orders index rose from
60.7 per cent to 61.6 per cent.
The leather, apparel, paper, fabricated metals, printing and publishing
industries showed the biggest gains in September.
The NAPM's price index rose from 74.5 per cent in August to 77.1 per cent in
September, its highest level for six years.
Of the 20 manufacturing sectors covered by the NAPM survey, 19 reported
paying higher prices for their raw materials.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US forces in Haiti yesterday stormed the headquarters of Fraph, the
nationalist paramilitary faction loyal to the army government, as the US
took the initiative on Haiti's political stability, reports James Harding in
Washington.
The attempt to neutralise the Front for the Progress and Advancement of
Haiti, which killed at least five people at a pro-democracy march last
Friday, was the first instance of the more aggressive US policy to disarm
those Haitians thought to be trying to derail the restoration of President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
After US soldiers had raided the offices of Fraph in downtown Port-au-Prince
and put a tank outside the building, a crowd of Aristide supporters gathered
outside.
The raid will be seen as a response to criticisms, after the violence at the
end of last week, that the US forces were failing to guarantee security of
pro-Aristide demonstrators. It may also have been pre-emptive - Fraph
members were reported to be planning attacks on Aristide activists in the
week before his scheduled return about October 16.
The importance of disarming the opposition was reinforced yesterday when a
US soldier was shot and injured.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Mexico move to charge deputy
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican Congress has moved to strip immunity from the member implicated
by the attorney-general's office in the assassination last week of Mr Jose
Francisco Ruiz Massieu, who was the number two official in the governing
party, the PRI.
The Congress stated that the necessary steps will be taken to lift the
immunity of Mr Manuel Munoz Rocha, a PRI congressman from the north-eastern
state of Tamaulipas.
The attorney-general's office is ready to charge Mr Munoz with having
masterminded the assassination.
The deputy was reported missing yesterday, although newspapers suggested
that he may be willing to surrender himself.
Investigators said they were told by an accomplice to the assassination that
Mr Munoz Rocha and Mr Rubio Canales, a former colleague of Mr Ruiz Massieu
now in prison, plotted the murder to slow political reform in the country,
to settle an old score with an enemy, and to weaken the government's battle
against drug traffickers.
The dead man's brother, Mr Mario Ruiz Massieu, is the deputy
attorney-general responsible for drug enforcement.
Financial markets in Mexico were rattled by the accounts of an alliance
between drug traffickers and political reactionaries willing to kill
reform-minded politicians.
At mid-morning yesterday, the Mexico City stock market was down 0.9 per
cent.
There has been much speculation in Mexico on whether other government
politicians were involved in the assassination, and whether there was a link
between this crime and the killing last March of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio,
the PRI's presidential candidate.
The government's special prosecutor has concluded that Mr Colosio was killed
by a lone, deranged gunman.
The attorney-general's office said Mr Ruiz Massieu was shot in the neck last
Wednesday by Mr Daniel Aguilar Trevino, who was captured at the scene of the
crime. Mr Aguilar said that Mr Fernando Rodrguez Gonzalez, an aide to Mr
Munoz, had offered him about Dollars 15,000 (Pounds 9,500) to kill Mr Ruiz
Massieu.
Mr Jorge Rodrguez Gonzalez, the brother of Fernando, admitted his
involvement in the crime on Friday, and has directly implicated Mr Munoz in
the attack, according to testimony released by the attorney-general's
office.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Inquiry ordered into funding of French political party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French Justice Ministry yesterday ordered an official investigation into
the funding of the Republican party, one of the largest groups in the
centre-right government and which is headed by Mr Gerard Longuet, industry
minister.
The announcement is a further blow to Mr Longuet, under pressure to resign
after allegations of irregular payments concerning a villa in Saint Tropez.
It is also a setback for Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, who is seeking
support from the Republicans as part of his strategy for next year's
presidential elections.
The decision to open a formal investigation, which has been rumoured for
several days, follows a report by Mr Renaud van Ruymbeke, an investigating
magistrate, which alleged irregularities in the party's funding. In
particular, he has questioned whether its Paris headquarters were acquired
on favourable terms and how it received an estimated FFr28m (Pounds 3.35m)
in cash between 1987 and 1991.
Mr Van Ruymbeke is also leading the investigation into the financing of Mr
Longuet's villa. Mr Balladur said at the weekend the investigation must
pursue its course but Mr Longuet should resign if formally charged. A
decision on whether to lay charges is due at the end of the month.
The Republican party is the largest element in the UDF, junior partner in
the governing coalition, which also comprises the Gaullist RPR party. Mr
Balladur is engaged in an undeclared battle with Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR
head, to represent the right in next spring's presidential polls.
The opening of the inquiry will further fuel demands for a reform of French
political funding. Mr Philippe Seguin, national assembly president, has
proposed an all-party study of the legislation and criticised Mr Balladur
for his reticence on the issue. Mr Pierre Mehaignerie, justice minister, has
proposed a separation between business and political party financing.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Trials to test the ground for information superhighways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government is to launch trial communications and computer
services in selected towns to determine whether to proceed with ambitious
proposals to develop a national information superhighway linking business
and households.
The move reflects a growing debate within the government and France Telecom,
the state telecommunications operator, about the technology and investments
required.
The debate has been fuelled by a report commissioned by the government from
Mr Gerard Thery, former managing director of France Telecom. He favours a
substantial investment over the next 15 years to connect 5m households and
businesses to information networks by the the year 2000. The cost of the
infrastructure, including the extension of fibre optic cables to households
and businesses, is estimated at about FFr10bn (Pounds 1.2bn) each year.
The scale of the project, however, worries some industry observers and
France Telecom itself, which had debts totalling FFr105bn at the end of last
year and would be expected to meet a significant part of the cost. France
Telecom also believes the technology is still evolving and that such a large
investment in fibre optic networks may be premature.
'Mr Thery's prescriptions are very bold, but potentially risky,' says one
Paris analyst. 'The government is tempted by the idea of a grand, populist
project, but it is also anxious to have some idea of the potential demand
for services.'
Behind such concerns lie the experience of the Plan Cable, a
government-backed scheme of the early 1980s to develop a nationwide cable
network. Despite FFr30bn of state and private investment, cable services
remain relatively underdeveloped and operators continue to suffer losses.
The aim of the trial services would be to ascertain the level of demand for
new services, from scientific and communications databases to interactive
entertainment systems.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Business as usual in Baltic, even with faulty door: Hugh
Carnegy sails from Stockholm to Helsinki on the world's largest
car-passenger ferry and finds few concerns for safety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If such issues as safety were bothering the 1,503 mainly Swedish and Finnish
passengers travelling on Sunday night from Stockholm to Helsinki on the
world's biggest combined passenger and car ferry, the Europa - with a faulty
bow door welded fast - they were well disguised.
It may have been a national day of mourning in Sweden for the victims of the
Estonia disaster, but the Europa's nine restaurants and seven bars were
busy; the nightclub dance floor was packed; and the cabaret show went ahead
with all its usual glitter.
Ms Harriet Johans, the cruise manager on board, said there had been few
cancellations and 'surprisingly little' concern expressed by passengers
about safety procedures.
The Europa, built in 1993 at the same German shipyard that built the Estonia
14 years ago, does not have the vertically-opening, visor-type bow door
which was at fault on the sunken ferry. Its outer bow doors instead open
outwards and backwards.
Yet in the rescue operation of the doomed Estonia on Wednesday night, the
heavy seas damaged the hinges and opening mechanism of the Europa's port bow
door, rendering it inoperable.
As the ferry had slipped stealthily out through the narrow passageways of
the Stockholm archipelago, Captain Vekko Sjolund insisted his ship's faulty
bow doors would have been safe even if they had not been welded shut after
the disaster that befell the Estonia.
'Our bow door is like a cork in a wine bottle,' said the captain as he stood
on his darkened bridge watching the navigation lights around the
archipelago's hundreds of islands sliding past the 60,000 gross tonne Silja
Europa.
'It seals tighter the more it is pushed into the hull. The bow on the
Estonia was more like the top on a cola bottle.'
Captain Sjolund and his Chief Officer Teijo Seppelin made a persuasive case
that the Europa and other Ro-Ro ferries are nothing like the deathtraps they
have tended to be portrayed as since last week if they are properly
maintained and crewed. 'I wouldn't be here if they were not safe,' said the
skipper.
The ship has a panel of 16 indicator lights prominently displayed on the
bridge connected to all the hull doors which switch from green to red if the
electronic monitors detect a breach or broken seal.
Colour television screens on the bridge scan the cargo decks and all areas
of the ship sensitive to its stability. On Sunday night, even a man enjoying
a jacuzzi in the pool room was clearly visible to the bridge officers on the
monitors.
However, the two senior officers admitted the open cargo decks of a Ro-Ro
make them quickly unstable if water does get into the ship. They agree that
building Ro-Ros with bulkheads - transverse walls to divide the deck space -
would make them less vulnerable.
'If you had bulkheads it would be safer of course,' said Mr Seppelin. 'But
it costs more money and it makes loading slower.'

FT  04 OCT 94 / Scalfaro forces change in budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has forced the Berlusconi government to make
two embarrassing last minute changes in the 1995 budget, affecting the Rai
state broadcasting organisation and reform of pensions.
In so doing Mr Scalfaro has once again been obliged to use his limited
authority as ultimate guarantor of the constitution to correct the behaviour
of the inexperienced five-month-old right-wing coalition.
Yesterday, Mr Gianni Letta, head of the prime minister's office, sought to
play down the incident saying: 'Too much weight has been given to the
president's intervention. It was merely a procedural observation.' However,
this contradicted Mr Scalfaro's own view of events.
Although the budget was approved by the cabinet on Wednesday after an
all-night session, the details were not available until late Friday. Indeed,
the president complained he had only been given the complex and voluminous
budget documentation to sign shortly before the September 30 midnight
deadline.
But he had already been made aware of budget proposals to raise the annual
fee paid by the Rai from L40bn (Pounds 16m) in 1994 to L160bn in 1995.
Although this effectively restored to 1993 levels the fee it paid for use of
three television channels, it threatened to undermine the organisation's
already parlous finances.
The move also highlighted the discrepancy between the L1.2bn annual
concession fee paid by the three channels of Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi's Fininvest company which was negotiated as part of the late
eighties political deal allowing the media magnate to dominate commercial
television.
On his own admission President Scalfaro had 'several' telephone
conversations with Mr Berlusconi pointing out the measures would contribute
to the Rai's financial ruin and appeared to be favouring his own networks.
Mr Berlusconi then agreed to withdraw the proposal - portraying the proposal
over the weekend as an unfortunate oversight.
It is the second time in two months Mr Scalfaro has checked the government's
hand over the Rai in the belief its behaviour was too partisan. The row also
reflects the near continuous tension between the head of state and Mr
Berlusconi over the latter's unresolved conflict of interest with his
ownership of Fininvest.
The other change concerned the way the government was seeking to present
controversial reform of the state pensions system in the budget. The
president refused to sign the budget until certain parts of the decree on
pension reform were separated from the budget itself. He successfully argued
pension reform required full parliamentary debate and therefore should not
be subject to the automatic time limit of budget legislation that closes on
December 31.
As a result, several elements of longer term reform in the pensions system
need not now be approved by parliament this year. The main provisions
covered by this longer timetable are the harmonisation of the big
differences in private and public sector pension practices; the separation
of expenditure on pensions from that on general welfare payments; and new
rules governing the operation of pension funds.
The changes will not itself affect the 1995 budget numbers since the savings
will come in freezes on early retirement benefits and indexed payments plus
changes in the structure of pensions accruals. But it could encourage
parliament to scrutinise pension reform more closely as well as play to the
sensitivities of the trade unions who have called a general strike on
October 14 against the budget.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Widening allegations that France's centre-right Republican party has
illegally funded itself are prompting calls for a further reform of the
country's political finance laws.
Mr Philippe Seguin, the national assembly president, has proposed an
all-party study into reforming legislation on the funding of political
parties, a move which, according to a Louis Harris poll in yesterday's
Infomatin newspaper, would have the backing of 90 per cent of French people.
Mr Seguin criticised Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, for failing to
respond to the allegations surrounding his trade and industry minister, Mr
Gerard Longuet, by instituting a wider reform. The prime minister confined
himself to saying that the investigation of Mr Longuet's affairs should
pursue its course, but that if by the end of this month this led to the
minister being formally charged, he would be asked to resign.
A Paris prosecutor has asked the justice ministry to appoint a magistrate to
investigate allegations that the Republican party received some FFr28m
(Pounds 3.35m) in cash during 1987-91, that it set up an advertising company
as a front to cream off commissions from companies, and that it received
'particularly advantageous' financing from property companies to buy its
Paris headquarters.

The scale of the proposed project, however, has drawn a concerned reaction

investment under Mr Thery's proposals, is struggling to reduce a debt burden
which totalled FFr105bn at the end of last year. It also believes that the

The aim of the trial services would be to ascertain the level of demand for

selected, but each trial is expected to involve several thousand homes and
businesses.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Italy's EU agricultural aid chief arrested
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Police yesterday arrested Mr Filippo Galli, the director-general of Aima,
the state body controlling EU agricultural aid, on charges of abuse of
office as part of a year-long investigation into agricultural fraud.
Mr Galli's arrest concerns the receipt of an alleged L200m (Pounds 81,460)
bribe from Mr Franco Ambrosio, the so-called 'King of Grain', who runs his
Italgrani trading empire from Naples. Mr Ambrosio has already been
interrogated about Aima aid but yesterday denied he had made any payment to
Mr Galli.
The Galli arrest follows that of Mr Giuseppe Fugaro, the deputy head of
Aima, for alleged abuse of office related to favours provided to Mr Pasquale
Casillo, the owner of Foggia football club and the entrepreneur in the south
with the biggest business interests after Mr Ambrosio. Mr Casillo is alleged
to have benefited from EU support for fake and inflated third country sales
of agricultural produce.
Mr Casillo is believed to be still in jail. Naples magistrates are currently
assessing how to tackle the problems arising from the seizure of almost
L2,000bn worth of Mr Casillo's assets, including several grain trading
companies. Meanwhile, Aima has recently changed its name to Eima and the
government is considering its disbandment.
In a separate development yesterday in the corruption investigations, a
close confidant of Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader and prime
minister, told a Milan court he had operated two secret Swiss banks for him
with funds totalling L30bn. The admission came from Mr Giorgio Tradati, who
was arrested last week on corruption charges relating to the receipt of a
L1bn bribe paid to the Socialists by the state-owned Ansaldo engineering
group.
His arrest followed evidence uncovered in Switzerland that bank accounts had
been opened in the early 1980s at SBS in Chiasso and American Express in
Geneva, by Mr Tradati as a front for Mr Craxi. Mr Tradati claimed Mr Craxi
had asked him to close the accounts when the corruption scandals began to
break but he refused. Mr Tradati said only L2bn of the L30bn had been
transferred to Italy, to help pay the Socialist party's debts and wages of
staff at L'Avenire, the party newspaper. The prosecution alleged the monies
had been kept secret in Switzerland largely for Mr Craxi's personal use.
This led Mr Craxi to send yet another of his many faxes from his
self-imposed exile in Tunisia, saying all the money in the accounts was for
party expenses. Mr Craxi is refusing to return to be interrogated, arguing
he cannot obtain a fair hearing.

Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all
data for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100.
Quarterly and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production
show the percentage change over the corresponding period in the
previous year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The
unemployment rate is shown as a percentage of the total labour force.
Figures for the composite leading indicator are end-period values.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Belgrade looks to backing of UN monitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes were rising in Belgrade last night that a delayed UN report would
clear the final hurdle to suspending some of the sanctions on Serbia and
Montenegro, the rump Yugoslavia.
In New York, a UN source said Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general, had received formal confirmation that Yugoslavia's
closure of its borders with the Bosnian Serbs to everything but food and
humanitarian goods is effective.
Confirmation came in the form of a report from the co-chairmen of the
international conference on the former Yugosalavia, Lord Owen of Britain and
Norwegian diplomat Thorvald Stoltenberg, the source said.
The lifting of sanctions would mean, among other things, that Belgrade's
airport will be reopened to foreign flights, and sporting and cultural
exchanges will once again be allowed. Expectations are running high and many
Serbs hope the favourable report by UN monitors will be the beginning of the
end of their country's pariah status.
Eighty-five UN monitors have been set the Herculean task of patrolling the
550km border for the past 10 days to see if military and other strategic
supplies are still slipping through. Working in small groups, they move from
one border crossing to another with an English translator to observe Serbian
police and customs officials checking outgoing traffic.
Over the weekend at the Zvornik border crossing on the main road from
Belgrade to Pale, the Bosnian-Serb capital, two tight-lipped Finnish
monitors watched a light stream of cars cross the Drina river to Bosnian
Serb-held territory. Some 40km north, another group was monitoring the
Sremska Raca crossing through which heavy vehicles carrying food and
medicine waited to pass. Drivers' identities were checked and car boots and
lorry trailers were briefly surveyed by the Serbs while the UN monitors
looked on, occasionally taking notes. One Serbian lorry driver carrying
potatoes and smuggled petrol for Serb-held Krajina admitted that 'the
inspections are not as tight as they could be. But we get through nothing
compared to before'.
More than two months ago, some of these border posts were the main supply
route to Bosnian-Serb fighters on the front line. Often the roads would be
packed with everything from Yugoslav-made T-55 tanks to cars stuffed with
light weapons and grenades. Mr Milosovic said he would stop this traffic in
early August when Dr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, refused to
follow him in accepting the peace plan devised by the so-called contact
group of nations.
Diplomats in Belgrade say they believe Mr Milosovic is committed to closing
the border with his former proteges. 'He has been let down and embarrassed
by Karadzic and must now concentrate on getting his own house in order. This
means getting sanctions lifted,' says one.
But a comment by Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, at the Nato summit
in Seville over the weekend suggests the Americans, at least, are not
convinced Mr Milosovic has closed the border completely. 'We have incomplete
reports that indicate that (the blockade) has been partially, but not fully,
complied with. (There is) certainly not a complete stoppage,' he said.
Even the UN monitors on the ground admit that the difficulty in monitoring
such a long border with so few men means that their report will be by no
means definitive. A final decision on whether the sanctions will be
suspended rests with Mr Boutros Ghali but he is unlikely to risk undermining
Mr Milosovic's attempt to co-operate.
However, few Serbs can afford air tickets, and any international sporting
and cultural links will only provide a much-needed psychological boost. They
are surviving the blanket economic sanctions through massive smuggling
operations which, say economists, is severely damaging the country's fragile
economy and until sanctions are completely lifted, the threat of economic
collapse is never far away.

Portugal's municipal authorities are to be given powers to regulate retail
opening hours in response to a campaign by small shopkeepers to ban Sunday
opening by hypermarkets and other big stores. Mr Fernando Faria de Oliveira,
trade and tourism minister, said yesterday the government would require
large stores to close at midday on Sundays in areas where local authorities
had failed to stipulate timetables by February 1995. He also announced an
Es70bn (Pounds 280m) incentive programme to help small retailers modernise.
Portugal has 3.8 retail food outlets per 1,000 inhabitants, the highest
level in the European Union. Small shops accounted for 48 per cent of food
retail sales in 1993.

Azerbaijan's President Haydar Aliyev imposed a state of emergency yesterday
after interior ministry troops held the general prosecutor captive overnight
to demand the release of jailed colleagues. The president said the seizure
of Mr Ali Umarov by the special interior ministry police amounted to a 'coup
d'etat'. He said that 'aggressive forces inside and outside the country are
still trying to destabilise the republic'. Government troops encircled the
base to which the disgruntled units withdrew after releasing Mr Umarov
without achieving their demands. All phone lines were cut between the
capital, Baku, and Russia and other former Soviet republics.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A draft law to speed up Turkey's privatisation hit new obstacles after the
resignation of a left-wing minister at the weekend, unnerving the stock
market and raising fears about the stability of the ruling coalition. The
departure on Saturday of state minister Mr Fikri Saglar to prepare his
Social Democratic Populist party (SHP), the junior coalition partner, for
by-elections in December interrupted the draft's progress toward parliament.
Cabinet members had last week announced the bill was ready to go before
parliament, giving a lift to the Istanbul stock market. The market index
fell back almost 2 per cent to 26,321.62 yesterday amid renewed fears of
delays and signs of fragility in the ruling coalition. Also missing is the
signature of Mr Mumtaz Soysal, foreign minister, who was attending a United
Nations meeting in New York last week, and the former public works minister,
Mr Mustafa Yilmaz. Political analysts said the latest blow to privatisation
was a result of political haggling after SHP's insistence on simultaneous
approval of a democratisation package, scrapping some laws limiting personal
freedoms.

Business and consumer confidence is climbing strongly in the European Union
as the first effects of the economic recovery filter through, the European
Commission said yesterday. Not only were consumers less worried about their
own financial situation in August, there was also a marked decline in fears
about job security. The review noted that industrial capacity utilisation
had recovered to 80.4 per cent, the same as in October 1992 although still
well below the peak of 85.8 per cent in 1988. But it stressed there was no
immediate risk of capacity shortages which could trigger a sudden rise in
inflation. The Commission noted that domestic demand was rising steadily,
broadening the base of the economic recovery which was still mainly
export-led.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The current German presidency of the European Union will today try to push
for new cuts in carbon dioxide emissions running into the next century, even
though the Twelve have still to put in place measures sufficient to meet
existing targets on greenhouse gas reduction. Draft conclusions for today's
meeting of EU environment ministers in Luxembourg call on the European
Commission to set reduction targets for CO2 to 2005 and 2010. The Union is
committed to stabilising CO2 emissions at 1990 levels by 2000, under the Rio
Convention on Climate Change. The conclusions acknowledge that 'the measures
taken so far by individual member states and at European level will not
suffice' to meet this pledge, and call in addition for EU-wide taxation of
energy sources.  The nearly three-year-old Union plan for a mixed carbon and
energy tax of up to Dollars 10 per barrel of oil equivalent - strongly
backed by Germany and northern states - now looks as though it will give way
to an aggregate of national taxes on fuel. 'The Germans are much more
flexible about what a tax instrument might be,' said one official from the
UK, which opposes the principle of an EU-level tax.

Belgrade is holding its breath as it awaits news of a delayed report by a
United Nations team on whether Serbia's President Slobodan Milosovic has
fulfilled his promise to close the border with the Bosnian Serbs to
everything but food and humanitarian goods.
If the report is positive, this will clear the final hurdle to suspending
some of the 28-month-old international sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro,
the two remaining constituents of Yugoslavia. Belgrade's airport will be

Diplomats in Belgrade say they believe Mr Milosovic is committed to closing
the border with his former proteges. 'He has been let down and embarrassed
by Karadzic and must now concentrate on getting his own house in order. This
means getting sanctions lifted,' says one.
But a comment by Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, at the Nato summit
in Seville over the weekend suggests the Americans, at least, are not
convinced Mr Milosovic has closed the border completely. 'We have incomplete
reports that indicate that (the blockade) has been partially, but not fully,
complied with. (There is) certainly not a complete stoppage,' he said.
Even the UN monitors on the ground admit that the difficulty in monitoring
such a long border with so few men means that their report will be by no
means definitive. A final decision on whether the sanctions will be
suspended rests with Dr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, but he
is unlikely to risk undermining Mr Milosovic's attempt to co-operate.
The sanctions under review, however, will not drastically effect economic
life in Serbia. Few Serbs can afford air tickets, and any international
sporting and cultural links will only provide a much-needed psychological
boost. As they wait for the report to be finalised and made public, they are
surviving the blanket economic sanctions through massive smuggling
operations. Most goods are easily available in Belgrade - at a price - and
there are thousands of cars in the city running on smuggled petrol.
Economists say that the smuggling is severely damaging the country's fragile
economy and until sanctions are completely lifted, the threat of economic
collapse is never far away.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Turkish privatisation snag
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A draft law to speed up Turkey's privatisation hit new obstacles after the
resignation of a left-wing minister at the weekend, unnerving the stock
market and raising fears about the stability of the ruling coalition. The
departure on Saturday of state minister Mr Fikri Saglar to prepare his
Social Democratic Populist party (SHP), the junior coalition partner, for
by-elections in December interrupted the draft's progress toward parliament.
Cabinet members had last week announced the bill was ready to go before
parliament, giving a lift to the Istanbul stock market. The market index
pulled back almost 2 per cent to 26,321.62 yesterday amid renewed fears of
delays and signs of fragility in the ruling coalition. Also missing is the
signature of Mr Mumtaz Soysal, foreign minister, who was attending a United
Nations meeting in New York last week, and the former public works minister,
Mr Mustafa Yilmaz. Political analysts said the latest blow to privatisation
was a result of political haggling after SHP's insistence on simultaneous
approval of a democratisation package, scrapping some laws limiting personal
freedoms. Privatisation, one of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's remedies to
contain the big budget deficit, expected to hit TL130,000m (Pounds 2.4bn)
this year, first ran into trouble when two earlier bills were annulled by
the supreme court after opposition challenges. If approved, the bill will
pave the way for the sale of big companies in telecommunications, airlines,
iron and steel, petroleum distribution and refining, mining and electric
power.

FT  04 OCT 94 / German Elections - October 16: East Germans reluctant to
come to party - The FDP is struggling to find its constituency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Werner Kolmorgen is exactly the kind of person the Free Democrats, the
junior partner in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing coalition, wants among
its ranks in eastern Germany. Full of enthusiasm after the Berlin Wall
collapsed five years ago, Mr Kolmorgen set up his own car repair and sales
business in the small town of Teterow in the eastern state of
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. He also joined the FDP after being a member of the
Liberal Democratic party of Germany, a former 'bloc' organisation sanctioned
by the east German Communist party. He even ran for local government,
becoming elected deputy mayor for the tiny hamlet of Gross Wokern.
But two years ago, Mr Kolmorgen, 42, left the party. 'I just gave up with
the FDP. I pulled out of the party. I could not identify with it any more.
It had no direction, no relevance for me,' he said.
Now Mr Kolmorgen is not certain for which party he will vote in federal
elections next month. The fact that this hard-working manager, who
represents the fledgling Mittelstand, the small and medium-sized enterprises
which formed the backbone of the FDP in western Germany, has turned his back
on the party reveals a problem common to all the western parties in eastern
Germany. They are having great trouble finding their natural constituencies.
After German unification, the FDP had a big advantage over the other
parties. It inherited two large 'bloc' parties: the Liberal Democratic party
of Germany which had 120,000 members, and the National Democratic party of
Germany which had a membership of 105,000.
As there was with the other bloc parties, there was a massive exodus of
members after 1990; there was no longer the political pressure to join a
party. By then, the newly founded FDP in eastern Germany had about 130,000
members. Today, it has fewer than 31,000.
'The first difficulty is that we have no Mittelstand - no strong economic or
entrepreneurial class to underpin the party,' said Mr Wulf Oehme, the FDP's
manager in Berlin.
About 40 per cent of its membership in the east consists of the Handwerk, or
small crafts and trades; intellectuals and scientists make up about 30 per
cent, the rest are pensioners and teachers.
The second problem is that the FDP has no personalities. 'We had
Hans-Dietrich Genscher (the former foreign minister). The easterners
identified with him. They do not identify with Klaus Kinkel (the leader of
the FDP and foreign minister).'
Yet both Mr Oehme and Mr Kolmorgen believe these reasons do not fully
explain the extraordinary demise of the FDP, which in the 1990 elections
gained 11 per cent of the federal vote and more than 10 per cent in eastern
Germany. But in the recent elections in Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony, and
Brandenburg, the party did not even gain the 5 per cent needed to enter the
state parliaments.
'The party failed to establish a separate political identity, whether it was
in coalition or not with governments in eastern Germany,' said Mr Oehme.
'Maybe we were always under the shadow of the Christian Democrats or the
Social Democrats in the east. In any case, we failed to be different, and we
failed to seek new allies.'
More crucially for the FDP's political philosophy, Mr Oehme believed, east
Germans simply did not identify with the party's liberal traditions and
values. 'In fact, liberalism, and I suppose politics, means very little to
them. They have other more important things to think about, like coping with
unemployment or adapting to the tremendous changes brought about by
unification.
'The east Germans do not want any more change. So when they voted for the
CDU in Saxony or the SPD in Brandenburg, they opted for big majority
governments based on strong personalities, not party policies. The
easterners want certainty and they want leaders who will come down hard on
law and order. They do not think about accountability,' said Mr Oehme.
Belatedly, the FDP has tried to woo back the vote in eastern Germany.
Instead of plastering the region with posters of Mr Kinkel, the FDP in
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has insisted that it put its own local personalities
on the election posters. But party activists admit these policies are
unlikely to have much impact in time for the elections.
'At the end of the day, the economic development of eastern Germany will
influence the emergence of politics based on policies rather than
personalities. Then we might have a chance,' said Mr Oehme. Perhaps then it
might woo back Mr Kolmorgen.

The United Nations and Nato have failed to bridge their differences over the
use of air power against Bosnian Serbs, agencies report from Split. Mr
William Perry, US defence secretary, discussed the issue for nearly three
hours with Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN special representative. Afterwards, Mr
Akashi indicated that the two sides had agreed on the need for a speedier
response to provocations, but he could not unconditionally agree with Nato's
call for strikes to be made without warning. In Sarajevo, the UN announced
that seven convoys carrying supplies for its peacekeeping forces were being
allowed to proceed by the Bosnian Serbs, despite a day's delay in
implementing an agreement.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Cardoso set to win Brazilian presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the social democrat candidate and a former
finance minister, looked set to become Brazil's next leader after exit polls
gave him a big lead in yesterday's presidential election.
Two polling agencies, Datafolha and Ibope, predicted that Mr Cardoso's lead
was big enough for him to win outright and avoid a second round run-off.
Datafolha said its exit polls gave him 47 per cent of votes cast compared
with 24 per cent for his nearest rival, Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the
leftwing Workers' party leader.
Excluding invalid votes, Mr Cardoso was projected to have 55 per cent
against 28 per cent for Mr da Silva. Exit polls accurately predicted the
outcome of the last presidential elections in 1989.
Counting of votes starts today and some urban areas may announce their
results this afternoon. But final results are not expected for at least 10
days because Brazil's 95m electors also voted for new state governors,
two-thirds of the Senate and all seats in the House of Representatives and
state legislatures.
Election authorities said voting appeared largely fair and orderly, due
partly to new rules which banned late campaigning at polling centres. But
several of Mr Cardoso's opponents described the election campaign as unfair.
Mr Cardoso has said he intends to concentrate on keeping inflation under
control and on modernising the state-driven economy. His popularity rests on
the Real currency which he planned when finance minister and which has led
to a sharp fall in inflation. Opponents claim he has benefited from the
Real's success and government backing.
Before release of the exit polls, Mr da Silva, who had led in opinion polls
until July, said he remained confident that there would be a second-round
run-off, scheduled for November. However, this would only happen if Mr
Cardoso received fewer votes than all his opponents combined. According to
the Datafolha poll, Mr Cardoso had a 10-point lead over his rivals,
suggesting no second round would be needed.
Mr da Silva repeated accusations that Mr Cardoso's party had distributed
ballot papers in which Mr da Silva's name appeared in the wrong place.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Warburg warns of sharp fall in profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
S. G. Warburg, the UK investment bank, warned yesterday that profits for the
six months ended September 30 would be less than half those for the same
period of 1993.
The group blamed tough conditions in the equity and bond markets for the
plunge in profits. Income from the investment banking side of the business
is believed to have collapsed.
Warburg's share price fell 101p to 569p, its lowest level this year. Other
leading City firms also suffered share price falls. Smith New Court, the
leading independent market-maker, saw its share price drop 40p to 334p.
Schroders, the merchant bank, fell 43p to 1335p and Kleinwort Benson, the UK
investment bank, finished 11p down at 440p.
Warburg said it would reorganise senior management to streamline decision
making and review costs in the wake of the profits warning.
The bank forecast first-half pre-tax profits of Pounds 55m to Pounds 65m
against a record Pounds 148.8m last time. The interim dividend is expected
to be held at last year's level of 6p.
Mercury Asset Management, in which Warburg has a 75 per cent stake, said its
profits would be maintained.
Analysts downgraded their forecasts for Warburg's results for the full
financial year to a range of Pounds 165m to Pounds 180m, compared with the
Pounds 297m in the previous year.
Warburg's profits warning comes after a round of trading losses and
redundancies at US investment banks such as Salomon Brothers, which have
seen market conditions deteriorate since the first quarter.
Lord Cairns, Warburg's chief executive, said a review of group costs was now
in progress, although he stopped short of committing the firm to significant
cuts.
Staff costs rose 40 per cent last year, much of it in performance-related
bonuses. Warburg's average staff expenses were the highest in the quoted
merchant banking sector last year at Pounds 105,000 a head.
Lord Cairns blamed the group's poor performance on 'thin, illiquid and quite
volatile markets' in equities, bonds and derivatives. Most trading
activities in the UK and in the US were affected, as were some in Europe.
Fee and commission income may also prove to be slightly lower than last
year, Warburg said.
As a result of the poor performance, Warburg said it would reorganise its
senior management so that decision-making became the responsibility of fewer
people. It said it would pare down the numbers on its management committees,
such as the investment banking committee, which has 18 members.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Baltic ferry operators to weld bow doors shut: Safety move
follows confirmation of cause of Estonia disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Baltic ferry operators are to take immediate steps to secure the bow doors
of their ships after investigators confirmed that the Estonia sank last week
because its outer bow door had been ripped off in stormy seas.
Viking Line and Silja Line, the Baltic's two biggest roll-on roll-off ferry
operators, said they planned to weld shut the bow doors of their ferries,
restricting vehicle loading and unloading to the stern of the ship. A
similar move was announced by Nordstrom &amp; Thulin, the Swedish joint owner of
the Estonia.
Nordstrom said it would permanently seal the bow doors of the Vironia, a
replacement ferry which is due to start sailing between Stockholm and
Tallinn later this month. The arrangement would 'totally remove possible
safety risks' at the front of the vessel, a sister ship of the Estonia, it
stated. Securing the bow doors will increase loading and port turnround
times.
Mr Harry Kulovaara, Silja Line executive vice-president, said: 'We think our
boats are totally safe but in this situation it is most probable that we
will weld the outer doors of some of our ferries.'
British ferry companies indicated last night that they were unlikely to
follow the Baltic operators' example. Stena Sealink, UK arm of the Swedish
group, said ferry companies could not act independently but would wait for
directions from the Transport Department.
P&amp;O European Ferries said it was waiting for detailed reports of what had
happened to the Estonia before deciding what to do about its 45 vessels.
The Baltic ferry operators made their move after Finland's transport
minister, Mr Ole Norrback, indicated that he might ban bow doors on ferries.
Investigators said the loss of the Estonia's outer bow door allowed water to
surge through an inner ramp and capsize the vessel within minutes.
The three-nation accident team said video footage of the stricken vessel,
lying in 80m of water, showed a 1m gap along the top edge of the normally
watertight bow ramp. The opening had allowed water to rush into the car
deck, rapidly destabilising the ship and causing it to sink.
More than 900 people died in the catastrophe last Wednesday when the vessel,
which was sailing from the Estonian capital Tallinn to Stockholm, went down
in stormy seas off Finland. Only 137 people survived.
Accident commission members, including representatives from Finland, Sweden
and Estonia, highlighted the failure of a bow door locking device as being
behind the disaster. They said they had seen footage of broken hinges but
had not been able to locate the visor-style outer bow door itself.
'The water inflow through the partly dislodged forward ramp has been of
sufficient magnitude to result in a lack of stability and the capsizing of
the ferry,' investigators said.
The findings confirm eye-witness testimony and expert opinion that only
something as dramatic as the tearing off of the bow door could have caused
the Estonia to capsize so quickly.
Swedish inspectors yesterday stopped a ferry sailing from Sweden to Denmark
after discovering faults in the bow section.

Financial markets fell again in the US and Europe yesterday amid growing
pessimism over the direction of US and UK interest rates.
US Treasury bond prices retreated on the release of data suggesting that the
economy was still growing in spite of five interest rate increases by the
Federal Reserve since February. A rise in the September index of the
National Association of Purchasing Managers was accompanied with news that
the prices component of the survey had reached a six-year high.
The figures reinforced suspicions that the Federal Reserve would soon raise
interest rates again to combat inflation.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was down half a point in late trading,
with the yield rising to 7.85 per cent.
In London, the FT-SE 100 index fell 42.8 points to 2,983.5.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Blair to tell party it must press ahead with reform: Left
makes gains on executive as unions take hard line on minimum wage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BLACKPOOL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, will respond today to another bout of
infighting with a warning to his party's Blackpool conference that it must
press ahead with its modernisation programme.
His annual conference debut as party leader - previewed by aides as 'bold
and uncompromising' - will follow a renewed attempt yesterday by leaders of
the main trades unions to set the agenda for Labour's economic strategy.
Mr Blair will tell delegates that 'new ideas, new thinking and new Labour'
are essential for the renewal of Britain. Urging party unity for the sake of
winning the next general election, he will add: 'I want you with me in our
task of renewal. I want you with me head and heart.'
During a sometimes irritable start to the week-long conference, Mr John
Edmonds and Mr Bill Morris, leaders respectively of the GMB and the TGWU
general workers unions, led a series of calls for the party to fix its
proposed minimum wage at half male median earnings.
Mr Blair, however, insisted that although the principle of a national
minimum rate for all workers was sacrosanct, the details of its
implementation would be fixed by the party's economic commission. He made
clear that the system would have to be introduced flexibly, with exemptions
for young people, if it were not to have a damaging impact on employment.
The party leadership suffered a setback when the annual poll for the party's
national executive committee saw the election of two leftwing MPs - Ms Diane
Abbott and Mr Dennis Skinner. Mr Blair retains a commanding majority on the
policymaking executive, but two of his strongest supporters - Ms Marjorie
Mowlam and Mr Chris Smith - failed to win places.
In a thinly veiled attack on the economic policies spelt out at the
conference by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, Mr Edmonds demanded
that Labour should fix a firm target for full employment. He told delegates
that over the next year it must 'mix some concrete in with the rhetoric'.
The decision by the union leaders to flex their political muscle over pay
and employment coincided with signs of renewed disquiet on the left of the
party over Mr Blair's insistence that middle-income earners will not suffer
through the party's tax plans.
Mr John Prescott, the deputy leader, is thought to be concerned that the
present stance might leave the party trapped by a pre-election cut in income
tax rates by the government. In those circumstances, Labour might be forced
to abandon either its pledge not to raise taxes on middle-income earners or
to drop key spending pledges.
Mr Brown used his conference appearance to attack the 'tax privileges' which
he said subsidised 'boardroom privilege'. Reaffirming that a Labour
government would restrict executive share options and tighten up residency
rules for the rich, he said Labour would 'rewrite the tax rules for the
undeserving rich'.
In what may be the most important speech of his political life, Mr Blair
will tell the party that the ditching of traditional policies does not mark
a rejection of its core values.
Marking out the dividing lines between Labour and the Conservatives, he will
set the party's central ambition as the spread of opportunity and social
justice. But his aides insisted he would leave no doubt of his determination
to widen the party's appeal to a suspicious electorate.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Estonia's bow doors were torn off in heavy storm: Video of
sunken ferry shows how water flooded car deck
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The outer bow door of the Baltic ferry Estonia was ripped off in heavy
storms, allowing water to surge in and capsize the vessel in minutes,
investigators said last night.
The three-nation accident team said video footage of the stricken vessel,
lying in 80 metres of water, showed a 1m gap along the top edge of the
normally water-tight bow ramp. The opening had allowed water to rush into
the cavernous car deck, rapidly destabilising the ship and causing it to
sink.
More than 900 lives were lost when the Estonia went down last Wednesday in
stormy seas off Finland. The vessel had been sailing from the Estonian
capital Tallinn to Stockholm.
Mr Raimo Tiilikainen, head of the rescue operation, acknowledged yesterday
that there had been a 30-minute delay before news of the Estonia's distress
was passed from Finnish to Swedish rescue authorities. He promised a
separate inquiry into the delay.
Accident commission members, including representatives from Finland, Sweden
and Estonia, highlighted the failure of a bow door locking device. They said
they had seen video footage of broken hinges but had not been able to locate
the visor-style outer bow door itself.
'The water inflow through the partly dislodged forward ramp has been of
sufficient magnitude to result in a lack of stability and the capsizing of
the ferry. The water-tight bow ramp behind the visor is still in place
although there is a 1m gap along the top edge,' the investigators said.
The findings confirm eye-witness testimony and expert opinion that only an
event as dramatic as the tearing off of the bow door could have caused the
Estonia to capsize so quickly.
Finland's transport minister, Mr Ole Norrback, said yesterday he would
consider banning the use of bow doors on ferries.
In a pre-emptive move, Nordstrom &amp; Thulin, the Swedish joint owner of the
Estonia, said it would permanently seal the bow doors of the Vironia, a
replacement ferry which is due to start sailing between Stockholm and
Tallinn later this month. The company said all loading and unloading would
take place through the stern in an arrangement which it claimed would
'totally remove possible safety risks' at the front of the ship.
Meanwhile, Swedish inspectors yesterday stopped a ferry sailing from Sweden
to Denmark after discovering serious faults in the bow section. The Lion
Prince, operated by Lion Ferry, a Stena Line subsidiary, was taken out of
service before it sailed from Varberg, south of Gothenburg, to Grenaa on the
Jutland peninsula.

Financial markets fell again in the US and Europe yesterday amid growing
pessimism over the direction of US and UK interest rates.
US Treasury bond prices retreated on the release of data suggesting that the
economy was still growing in spite of five interest rate increases by the
Federal Reserve since February. A rise in the September index of the
National Association of Purchasing Managers was accompanied with news that
the prices component of the survey had reached a six-year high.
The figures reinforced suspicions that the Federal Reserve would soon raise
interest rates again to combat inflation. That outweighed the positive
effect of the partial accord reached by US and Japanese trade negotiators at
the weekend to open Japan to US goods and services.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was down half a point by early afternoon
trading, with the yield rising to 7.86 per cent.
In London, the FT-SE 100 index fell 42.8 points to 2,983.5. UK shares were
trading lower even before the purchasing managers' index report, in the wake
of the profits warning from SG Warburg, the investment bank, and a sharp
rise in the annual growth rate of M0, the narrow measure of the money
supply.
M0 rose by a seasonally adjusted 7.1 per cent in the 12 months to September,
well above the government's 0-4 per cent monitoring range. Given that M0 is
one of the government's inflationary indicators, the jump in the annual
growth rate, from 6.3 per cent in August, increased fears of a further rise
in base rates this year.
However, some analysts pointed out that statistical factors had distorted
M0's growth.
The fall in the London market continued a volatile sequence which has seen
the FT-SE 100 index rise or fall by more than 30 points on each of the last
four trading days. 'This volatility is going to continue until we have clear
visibility on the direction of US rates,' said Mr Keith Skeoch, chief
economist at broker James Capel.
Although the German stock market was closed for Unity day, other European
markets were also affected by a general mood of gloom yesterday.

The UK fashion retailer is expected to deliver an increase of more than 50
per cent in interim profits to Pounds 3.7m (Dollars 5.8m) on Thursday. The
company's strategy of defending margins in the face of heavy discounting by
rival fashion retailers is thought to be paying off. Shares in the group,
which is heavily weighted towards the second half, have risen from the
year's low of 217p in April to well over 300p.

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Negotiations on measures to strengthen the 1972 treaty which outlaws
biological weapons will start next January, treaty members decided at the
weekend.
After two weeks of difficult talks in Geneva, some 80 governments agreed to
establish an ad hoc group to draft proposals on verification, anti-cheating
measures and other compliance issues.
However, industrialised and developing countries could not agree on how
quickly to advance. The industrialised countries want the group, open to all
131 treaty members, to push on with a draft protocol for approval at the
next treaty review conference, in 1996. But some developing countries want
to proceed more cautiously.
They have succeeded in qualifying the group's mandate in ways that would
allow it to produce non-binding recommendations or to delay completion of
its work beyond 1996. Thus the stage is set for arduous negotiations when
the group convenes in January.
Unlike related accords, the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the
chemical weapons convention, the biological weapons convention has no
provisions against cheating.
Third World countries are worried by the threat which tougher measures to
enforce compliance could pose to technology transfer and development of
their own biotechnology industries. They also fear intrusive inspections of
military facilities.

Awful lot of voting in Brazil
Brazil holds its biggest set of elections since the 1950s with 1,654 jobs,
including that of president, being contested by more than 12,000 candidates.
Attention will focus on the race for the presidency and whether the
front-runner, former finance minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, can win
outright in the first round by polling more votes than all his competitors
combined. His chief rival will be Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing
Workers Party.
Voting also takes place for two-thirds of the senate and all the lower house
of Congress, as well as for state governors and parliaments. Counting is
expected to take between 10 and 15 days.
IMF meetings: As part of the annual meetings of the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank, being held in Madrid, the development committee will
consider the effectiveness of aid programmes to the developing world and
examine how the Uruguay Round trade liberalisation measures will affect
developing nations.
Nelson Mandela, President of South Africa, on a trip to the US, addresses
the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Rubber: Negotiations resume in Geneva (to Oct 14) on a rubber commodity pact
to replace the accord that expires in December. It is the only remaining
international commodity pact with buffer stock arrangements to stabilise
prices. But consumer and producer countries differ sharply on the
intervention price levels and range for the new agreement.
Labour Party conference: Britain's main opposition party opens its first
annual conference since the election of Tony Blair as leader at the seaside
resort of Blackpool in north-west England (to Oct 7).
Mr Blair is guaranteed a standing ovation when he addresses delegates on
Tuesday, and is certain to win endorsement for a policy shift towards
support for the market economy. But he will have to fight off leftwing
demands for a commitment to a specified minimum wage.
Eurotunnel starts a limited passenger car shuttle service though the Channel
tunnel for invited shareholders and VIPs including its bankers, MPs, MEPs
and representatives of the travel trade. The car shuttle operation is
starting nearly 18 months later than planned and foreshadows the launch of a
full turn-up-and-go service expected to begin in mid-November. Eurostar
passenger trains are not expected to start service before late October.

Yeltsin marks uprising
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia is due to hold a press conference to mark
the first anniversary of the failed uprising of hardline parliamentarians
and the storming of the White House in which 140 people were killed. Mr
Yeltsin is expected to spell out his political agenda as the new parliament
begins its autumn session this week.
Madrid Meetings: The formal annual meetings of the two Bretton Woods
institutions, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, start with
keynote addresses from Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, and Lewis
Preston, president of the World Bank group. The meetings continue until
Thursday.
European Union foreign ministers, holding their monthly gathering in
Luxembourg, will look at plans to help east and central European countries
prepare their economies and legislation for membership of the Union. The
ministers will also review relations with former Soviet republics, in
particular Ukraine, whose foreign minister they have invited for dinner.
Lloyd's of London: Judgment in the Gooda Walker case, the biggest legal
action by loss-making Lloyd's Names, is expected today. A group of 3,095
Names, the individuals whose assets support the markets, are suing 71
Lloyd's agencies for Pounds 629m in losses sustained by syndicates managed
by the Gooda Walker agency. During a case which was heard during the summer,
Names alleged negligent underwriting was responsible for their losses.
Council of Europe: President Ion Iliescu of Romania begins a two-day visit
to Strasbourg, where he will meet senior representatives of the Council of
Europe, including secretary-general Daniel Tarschys. Because of its
controversial human rights record, Romania was the last of central Europe's
former communist states to join the Council a year ago. It continues to
raise concerns over Romania's treatment of its ethnic, religious and sexual
minorities, and its judicial system.
Saleroom: Christie's in London is auctioning more than 230 original
watercolours painted by various artists in the 1860s for John Gould's
volumes The Birds of Great Britain (1860-73), carrying estimates of between
Pounds 2,000 and Pounds 15,000.
Gould is considered as important to English ornithology as John James
Audubon is to North American. The collection was assembled by the naturalist
and traveller Frederick du Cane Godman. It is rare for such desirable
drawings to appear on the market and the appearance of so large a hoard has
sent Gould collectors into a frenzy. The estimates should be much exceeded.

US-N Korea talks resume
High-level US-North Korea talks on eliminating Pyongyang's capacity to make
nuclear weapons are due to resume in Geneva. Robert Gallucci, US
ambassador-at-large, said last Thursday after a week of talks that little
progress had been made but neither side wants the talks to collapse.
Negotiations
centre on the terms on which the US will organise the supply of light-water
atomic reactors to replace North Korea's graphite-moderated ones, which
produce more of the plutonium used in nuclear bombs.
Chris Patten, governor of Hong Kong, gives his third annual policy speech,
outlining his plans for the colony. He is expected to give a progress report
on pledges made last year and announce a fresh round of spending. The real
focus of interest, however, will be on any proposals for improving relations
with Beijing. This could prompt Mr Patten to revise his views on working
with Beijing-appointed bodies such as the Preparatory Committee.
European Union environment ministers, on the second day of a two-day session
in Luxembourg, discuss with their counterparts from six east European states
how their environment laws and policies can be brought into line with the
EU's.
The EU ministers will also be attempting yet again to agree on a strategy to
combat global warming. Plans for a mixed carbon and energy tax of up to
Dollars 10 per barrel of oil equivalent have been blocked for nearly three
years by UK opposition to the principle of an EU-wide tax, and the
misgivings of southern member states and France about its effects. Efforts
are now focused on jointly agreed national measures to cut carbon dioxide
emissions.
US congressman Dan Rostenkowski, once powerful chairman of the House ways
and means committee, goes to court to seek dismissal of the 17-count
corruption indictment against him on constitutional grounds.
Frankfurt book fair, the leading annual event for publishers, begins (to Oct
10). In this, the 46th year, the theme is Brazil.
Nashville, Tennessee, plays host to the 28th Annual Country Music
Association Awards.

Paris Motor show opens
The main world show of the autumn opens as new car sales in Europe recover
hesitantly from the deep recession of 1993. The show, which runs to October
16, is dominated by Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen. Last week, Peugeot
announced a return to profit after last year's loss.
As carmakers look at trends for cars in the 21st century, Citroen is to show
its Xanae concept car. The company says it represents a new approach to
automotive design, half-way between a conventional saloon car and a people
carrier.
British-based Rover Group is to unveil its latest Range Rover 4-wheel drive
luxury 'off-road' vehicle.
UK economy: The output figures for August will be watched closely by the
markets in the light of the recent surge in industrial production. Most
analysts expect the monthly rate of manufacturing growth to have slowed
slightly in the month, even before September's controversial UK base rate
rise.
However, the underlying trend remains strong, with a 4.6 per cent
year-on-year rate forecast.
European Union commissioner on trade competition Sir Leon Brittan begins a
trip to South Africa (to Oct 10).

7 FRIDAY
US employment data due
Today's US employment data for September provide the first real indicator of
whether the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates in August has
done anything to slow economic expansion. The median forecast in MMS
International's survey predicts growth of 250,000 in non-farm payroll
employment, with the unemployment rate unchanged at 6.1 per cent.
US congress is scheduled to recess for the mid-term election campaigns. With
so many close contests expected, the deadline might actually be met. The
Senate is scheduled to return on November 30 for two days of debate on the
Uruguay Round Gatt legislation. The House is scheduled to vote on the Round
on Wednesday, but its leaders are being urged to postpone the vote until
after the elections.
Bernard Tapie, the French politician and soccer boss, is due to make a court
appeal against seizure of his art works and furniture by his creditor bank,
Credit Lyonnais.
London fashion week, highlighting the spring and summer collections for
1995, starts with a reception attended by the Princess of Wales (to Oct 9).
Day of Courtesy: Britain's Polite Society hopes the event will counteract
the alienating effects of technology. It says such gadgets as automatic
doors, which people no longer have to hold for each other, reduce human
contacts.
8-9 WEEKEND
Austria goes to the polls
The Socialist-Conservative coalition that has ruled Austria for most of the
postwar period looks set to win another mandate in national elections on
Sunday, but with its 76 per cent majority reduced.
Rightwing populist Jorg Haider has bounced back after a disastrous
referendum campaign in June opposing Austrian membership of the European
Union. He could take seats from both traditional parties.
Saleroom: On Saturday, Sotheby's holds its first wine sale in New York, in
co-operation with Sherry-Lehmann, owner of a well respected liquor store on
Madison Avenue. Sotheby's expects to raise more than Dollars 1m from almost
1,000 lots. Until this year, wine auctions were forbidden in the city.
Kurile islands: A group of Japanese is due to visit the Russian-held island
of Etorofu on Saturday. The island is one of three in the Kurile chain off
northern Japan seized by the Soviet Union at the end of the second world
war.
The travellers are descendants of island dwellers and wish to visit their
ancestors' graves. Russia occasionally allows Japanese to land without visas
as a good will gesture, designed to defuse a row over ownership of the three
islands.
