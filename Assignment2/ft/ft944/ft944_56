FT  01 OCT 94 / International Company News: Fininvest forecasts debt cut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Heavily-indebted Fininvest, the media, stores and financial services group
owned by Italian premier Mr Silvio Berlusconi, expects to reduce the debt
burden by one third, to L2,800bn (Dollars 1.8bn), by the year end.
This was the group's forecast yesterday as it released its 1993 accounts.
Last year, Fininvest debts totalled L3,920bn on a turnover of L11,552bn, up
10 per cent from L10,469bn in 1992. The forecast drop in net indebtedness
comes from the anticipated L990bn in proceeds from the 53 per cent flotation
of Mondadori, the group's publishing arm.
Since January, Mr Berlusconi has had no direct managerial role. The
chairmanship has been entrusted to his close friend Mr Fidele Confalonieri,
while executive management is in the hands of Mr Franco Tato.
Net profits were L11.5bn, down from L21.1bn and marginally lower than
originally anticipated. However, the 1992 figures were boosted by large
extraordinary revenues, while last year's asset disposals - notably the 24
per cent divestment of Fininvest Italia (insurance) to Ennio Doris, which
raised L240bn - also helped the bottom line.
During the year, debt restructuring helped cut financial charges from L556bn
to L386bn. The operating result was up 12 per cent to L557bn, in part due to
new accounting methods to cover the depreciation of television rights. It is
understood that reservations about contingent liabilities, raised by
accountants Arthur Andersen on the 1992 accounts, have been addressed.
However, the 1993 accounts have apparently raised queries concerning a
L330bn credit affecting foreign television rights.
Pre-tax profits rose to L209.3bn, compared with L73.9bn in 1992. The
heavily-increased tax bill was blamed on strong profits in the publishing
and financial products divisions, plus reduced tax credits.

FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Off-field activities help Man United to
double
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manchester United yesterday announced a sharp increase in full year profits
as the Premiership champions benefited from increasingly lucrative
non-footballing activities.
The FA Cup holders saw pre-tax profits more than double to Pounds 10.78m
(Pounds 4.2m) as the contribution from gate receipts, its staple income, was
overtaken by off-the-field businesses such as merchandising, sponsorship and
catering.
Those activities helped lift profits before transfer fees from Pounds 8.19m
to Pounds 11.45m, on turnover ahead 74 per cent at Pounds 43.8m (Pounds
25.2m) in the year to July 31.
Although the figures were flattered by relatively low spending on new
players and capacity constraints last year, Mr Martin Edwards, chief
executive, said the improvement had persuaded the club to draw up plans to
expand Old Trafford by more than 22 per cent. The club wants to increase its
stadium capacity to about 54,000, enabling it to exploit excess demand for
match tickets.
While negotiating possible land purchases around the stadium, Mr Edwards
also signalled an increasing drive to tap merchandise sales, which almost
trebled from Pounds 5m to Pounds 14.2m.
'Most of the growth has come from wholesaling,' he added. 'We've signed an
overseas marketing deal in Japan for our products and other countries are
lining up.'
The balance sheet, meanwhile, was strengthened by a Pounds 2.75m increase in
the transfer fee reserve to Pounds 4m, the facility which allows the club to
set aside a proportion of profits to cover future player acquisitions and a
possible fall in gate receipts should the team falter in league and cup
competitions.
Earnings per share rose from 24.3p to 61.1p before switching funds to the
transfer reserve, and 38.5p (32.5p) after. The final dividend is lifted to
14.5p (13.5p) for a total of 21p (19.5p).
Mr Robin Launders, finance director, also announced a 4-for-1 share split to
improve the marketability of the shares, which rose 9p to 694p.
COMMENT
The Reds appear to have scored a hat-trick with on-field goals, retail sales
and rampant ticket demand. Increased sponsorship and a possible Pounds 7m
windfall from the European Cup makes the prospects look rosey. But the
figures are untypical. They have been distorted by smaller crowds in 1993, a
year when the club spent Pounds 4m on players. To ensure success in Europe,
the club will have to spend more on English players - denting future
profits. Payments to such players last year pushed staff costs up to Pounds
11.1m (Pounds 7.59m), a figure likely to increase. Profits this year,
therefore, could fall to around Pounds 7.5m. On a forward multiple of 16.2,
the shares are a must only for long-term investors and diehard fans.

FT  01 OCT 94 / International Company News: BK Vision upbeat on UBS move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BK Vision, the investment company seeking shareholder support to alter the
direction of Union Bank of Switzerland, said yesterday it was optimistic
that a majority of UBS shareholders would reject the bank's proposal to
abolish its registered shares.
This class of shares has five times the voting power of the bank's bearer
shares. UBS on Thursday said it suspected BK Vision, controlled by Mr Martin
Ebner's BZ banking group, was putting together a concert party to seize
control of the bank, mainly through purchases of the registered shares.
The registered shares, on which voting rights are restricted to Swiss
citizens, have been trading at a substantial premium to the bearers in
recent months.
UBS has called an extraordinary general meeting on November 22 to approve a
split of bearer and registered shares into bearers of equal par value. No
compensation would be offered to registered shareholders for the loss of
preferential voting power or the premium value on their shares.
BK Vision, which holds 19 per cent of the registered shares, worth some
SFr1.2bn (Dollars 938m), said the UBS move had already damaged the
reputation of the Swiss financial market as a place which protected property
rights. However, it did not indicate what action it might take.
UBS shares were the most actively traded issues in Zurich yesterday, and the
trend suggested investors believed BK Vision would succeed in convincing a
majority of registered shareholders to vote against the UBS proposals. The
bearer shares ended down SFr5 at SFr1,200 after a high of SFr1,246. The
registered were down SFr21 to SFr303 after a high of SFr310.

FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: BFI bid impossible to rubbish - Attwoods
still insists the price is too low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even Mr Ken Foreman, chief executive of Attwoods, cannot fault the logic
that has prompted a hostile Pounds 364m bid for his waste services company.
Attwoods makes a sound fit with Browning-Ferris Industries, the US company
valued at Dollars 6bn which is offering 109p a share in cash. 'You cannot
argue with it from their point of view,' Mr Foreman says. 'But you can point
out it is worth a lot more than they are paying.'
BFI disagrees, of course. It says it has factored in the benefits of
synergies in the US and a premium to what it believes is the true trading
level.
BFI bases its offer on two main arguments: price and industry dynamics. On
the first issue, it is convinced that Attwoods has been inflated by bid
speculation following management changes at Laidlaw of Canada, its largest
shareholder with 29.8 per cent of the ordinary shares and 73 per cent of the
preference stock.
BFI also argues that the shares have been kept artificially high by a belief
that Laidlaw would not take a further writedown on its stake. In 1991,
Laidlaw halved the carrying value of its original Dollars 900m investment to
Dollars 10.25 per American Depositary Receipt - equivalent to five ordinary
shares. Yet Laidlaw has agreed to sell its ordinary shares to BFI at Dollars
8.50 per ADR, and its prefs at 85p, even if a second bidder enters with a
higher offer.
Attwoods' shares did rise sharply in the months after the arrival of Mr Jim
Bullock as Laidlaw's chief executive. However, at about the same time, the
group announced the sale of its loss-making recycling business, Mindis, and
institutional investors began buying in earnest. But the gains were wiped
out by March soon after the Attwoods board met to consider second-quarter
results that would show disappointing performance in Germany.
Attwoods argues that, contrary to BFI's claims, Laidlaw's intentions to sell
depressed the shares when 1995 recovery potential should have enhanced them.
The fact that Laidlaw agreed to take 109p, the closing price the day before
the offer, simply reflects the pressures on one shareholder, Attwoods
argues. This has no relevance to what others should be demanding of their
investment. Outsiders are divided over whom to believe. Most UK analysts
think the offer is opportunistic. Industry insiders and US analysts,
however, tend to agree with BFI's assessment of an inflated share price.
'Absolutely. There is no doubt that they were buoyed by bid speculation,'
said one waste executive.
BFI's second, and more convincing, argument is based on industry dynamics,
largely in the US. It claims Attwoods could be severely handicapped in an
industry demanding higher levels of investment and more sophisticated
solutions to waste disposal.
'The market in the US is responding to public concerns about the
environment,' BFI says. 'They want their waste managed in different ways.'
To return real earnings growth in the US, where Attwoods earns more than
three-quarters of its profits, BFI argues companies must do everything from
collecting to disposing of waste, or recycling it for eventual resale. Yet
Attwoods has limited itself largely to collection in the us, which is lower
margin.
Regulation is also forcing companies to adopt an increasingly integrated
approach. In California, for example, legislation demands that 50 per cent
of waste which is collected must be recycled.
Yet Attwoods last year sold its only recycling business at a huge Pounds 91m
loss, just before the prices of recycled materials began to firm.
BFI says Attwoods' strategy has left it depending on rivals to dispose of
waste. That was fine when landfill prices were falling, but now they too
have begun to stabilise, says BFI.
Furthermore, the increasingly competitive nature of municipal contracts, on
which Attwoods relies heavily in both its US markets, mean it will face
price pressure in its everyday business.
Many of BFI's arguments about trends in the US waste industry are supported
by analysts and rivals. Mr Hugh Holman of Alex Brown, a leading US waste
analyst, says 'integrating collection and disposal operations provides the
best opportunity for stable margins'. WMX Technologies, the world's biggest
waste group, has also been pursuing a policy of integrated services.
Yet BFI has, remarkably, not broadcast a more immediate bonus from the
acquisition of Attwoods. The target's business would give a nice boost to
BFI's own solid waste collection operation, expected to return flat profits
this year.
While acknowledging that a takeover makes sense strategically, Attwoods
dismisses as rubbish BFI's claims that it would create an integrated company
in its largest market, Florida. BFI does not own landfills there, while
Attwoods has three. Yet BFI does have recycling operations there.
Attwoods also dismisses BFI's attacks on its recent performance as
unjustified. All waste companies have suffered earnings declines and
write-offs, Mr Foreman claims. BFI itself, he says, has had exceptional
charges of Dollars 793m in the last five years and its credit rating is
under review.
Finally, Attwoods will also give BFI a significant boost in the recovering
UK market, where it has both collection and landfill interests.
All this means that any offer, hostile or otherwise, deserves a premium,
Attwoods says. Which brings investors neatly back to the issue of price. As
Mr Foreman has admitted, Attwoods will be hard-pressed to discredit BFI's
strategic arguments.

<TEXT>
Herman's Sporting Goods, the ill-starred US sporting goods retailer, has
emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and plans to expand. Herman's is owned by
an investor group led by the New York merchant banks Whitman Heffernan Rhein
and Carl Marks.
The group bought Herman's in March 1993 and put it into Chapter 11 three
days later.
Herman's was originally acquired by the UK's Dee Corp (now Gateway) in 1986
for Pounds 278m (Dollars 439.2m), and promptly went into loss as a result of
ill-judged expansion. Gateway was taken over in 1989 in the UK's largest
buy-out, and attempts were made to sell Herman's. The eventual sale price
was believed to have been about Dollars 40m.
The new owners have used bankruptcy protection to return Herman's to its
stronghold in the north-east states, closing all stores west of Pennsylvania
and south of Virginia.

FT  01 OCT 94 / International Company News: Swiss Re sells non-core
businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Swiss Reinsurance, the world's second largest reinsurer after Munich
Reinsurance, is selling all its interests in primary insurance companies to
concentrate on expanding its core business.
In the most important transaction, Allianz of Germany, Europe's largest
insurer, has agreed to pay SFr1.5bn for Swiss Re's 60 per cent stake in
Elvia, Switzerland's fifth largest insurance company with annual premium
volume of SFr2.6bn (Dollars 2bn). It will also make an offer to public
shareholders for the balance at SFr3,915 per share. The planned purchases
will increase the Allianz group's premium income - DM65.5bn (Dollars 43.6m)
last year - by almost 20 per cent.
This marks the first big advance of a non-Swiss company into the lucrative
and recently-liberalised Swiss insurance market.
Allianz has also agreed to buy Vereinte/Magdeburger of Munich from Swiss Re,
which would substantially strengthen its already solid position in the
German market.
It is also purchasing Swiss Re's 62.7 per cent stake in Lloyd Adriatico of
Trieste for SFr600m, and making an offer to minority shareholders at L20,342
per ordinary share and L14,335 per savings share.
Meanwhile, Switzerland's Winterthur Insurance will take over the troubled
Schweiz Seguros of Barcelona and Schweiz Italia of Milan, as well as Swiss
Re's majority stake in La Equitativa of Madrid. Terms were not disclosed.
Swiss Re also published its 1993 financial results yesterday, showing a 15.7
per cent rise in net income to SFr325m on gross premium income of SFr23.7bn,
up 8.3 per cent. The directors are proposing a 9.4 per cent dividend rise to
SFr10.50 per share.
The profit gain was achieved in spite of SFr360m in losses on its primary
insurance businesses, mainly due to a 'misguided business policy' at Schweiz
Seguros. Swiss Re has provided SFr480m to put Seguros in order before
Winterthur takes it over.
Mr Lukas Muhlemann, who joined Swiss Re as chief executive a month ago, said
a strategic review by the group had concluded that the primary insurance
market would polarise around big companies and niche players as deregulation
in Europe proceeded.
Swiss Re's companies fitted into neither of these categories, 'so we were
not good owners for them', Mr Muhlemann, former managing director of
McKinsey &amp; Co in Switzerland, said. On the other hand, there was a 'great
future' in the reinsurance business, in which Swiss Re was well-placed
globally.

profits rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Benetton, the Italian-based clothing group, fell sharply yesterday
after it announced a rise in net profit to L100.5bn (Dollars 64.7m) in the
first half of 1994, from L98.6bn in the equivalent 1993 period.
Operating profit, however, fell by 8.5 per cent to L193bn from L211bn, as
the company persisted with the price-cutting policy introduced two years ago
to combat the international slump in consumer demand.
Investors were disappointed with the performance, and marked the shares down
by 4.7 per cent, to L20,927, in a depressed Milan stock market.
Benetton said it expected the full-year increase in net profit to be
'slightly higher' than the 1.9 per cent first-half improvement. In 1993,
Benetton's consolidated profits rose 12.6 per cent to L208bn.
The continuation of the price-reduction policy in the first half - with cuts
ranging from 6 per cent in Italy to 28 per cent in Japan - allowed Benetton
to pursue its increase in sales volume. Total turnover rose slightly to
L1,367bn from L1,362bn.

FT  01 OCT 94 / International Company News: Lufthansa and Thai Airways in
link talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lufthansa is negotiating a co-operation agreement with Thai Airways with the
aim of fashioning a network spanning the world, according to Mr Jurgen
Weber, chairman.
The German flag-carrier, which earlier this week offered 5m shares at DM182
(Dollars 118.10) each in a heavily oversubscribed combined rights issue and
placing operation, said it expected talks to be completed before the end of
November.
A deal with the Thai flag-carrier would provide a crucial link in
Lufthansa's fast-growing list of partnerships built around an agreement with
United Airlines of the US, which already co-operates with Thai.
Mr Weber said the arrangement with United was exceeding expectations. During
July and August its transatlantic flights had been filled almost every day.
Meanwhile, Dresdner Bank, which led a book-building exercise for this week's
capital-raising, said 3.9m shares offered in the rights issue had been
widely distributed among private international investors.
A further 1.1m from the federal government's holding had been placed.
Heavy demand had enabled the offering to be priced at only a small discount
 -DM2 - to Thursday's Frankfurt stock market closing price of DM184, it
said.
The issue and placing marked a decisive change in Lufthansa's status. The
sale of government stock and Bonn's non-participation in the rights issue
mean the government no longer holds a majority.
It plans to reduce its stake further in the next year or two, although it is
not yet clear if it will dispose of its entire holding.
This week's exercise, involving the first large-scale book-building effort
in Germany - in which potential investors were canvassed in advance - is
widely seen as a rehearsal for further privatisations planned in Bonn.

FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: NMB sold to Bank of England for nominal
amount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The short and unhappy life of National Mortgage Bank as a subsidiary of
National Home Loans ended yesterday when its parent announced that it was
being sold to the Bank of England for a nominal sum.
In February 1992, NHL said it had decided to run down the business and would
make no further investment in it. Mr Ian Hay Davison was installed as
chairman to manage the winding down of the bank.
Mr Jonathan Perry, NHL executive chairman, said NHL had already written off
all its investment in NMB and the announcement merely transferred the
ownership.
NMB was set up in 1989 and dealt in commercial mortgages, leasing and second
mortgage loans. It also offered current account banking facilities and had a
full banking licence.
By 1991, however, it was suffering in the aftermath of the collapse of the
Bank of Credit and Commerce International, as local authorities began
pulling deposits out of smaller banks. NMB's accounts show that institutions
other than banks - mostly local councils - withdrew deposits totalling
Pounds 292m in 1991, more than half its total deposits.
The withdrawals led to a group of 10 banks agreeing to put up a Pounds 200m
cash lifeboat for NHL, supported by an indemnity from the Bank of England.
The arrangement was extended and increased in March 1992.
The Bank of England's annual reports show that provisions for support
operations in 1991-92, mainly in respect of NMB, totalled Pounds 115m at
end-February 1993, falling to Pounds 105m at the end of February this year.
The announcement merely changes the form rather than the substance of the
Bank's support.
NHL's core business is providing mortgages for residential property. It
returned to new lending only four months ago through its Homeloans Direct
subsidiary.

FT  01 OCT 94 / International Company News: Headquarters sale winds up
Metallgesellschaft disposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft yesterday completed its assets fire sale with the
disposal for an estimated DM500m (Dollars 324.7m) of its Frankfurt
headquarters to Difa, a Hamburg-based property investment fund.
Final legal details were hammered out yesterday, the last day of the current
financial year, allowing the consideration to be included in the 1993-94
accounts.
Metallgesellschaft will lease back the building, on a prime 25,000 sq metre
site next to the Alte Oper opera house and between the banking quarter and
fashionable West End area, for three years.
Unofficial estimates had earlier suggested it might earn about DM700m from
the sale. Although the price was not disclosed, officials said DM500m was
'plausible'. It is understood Deutsche Bank, one of the group's main
shareholders and its leading creditor, was also interested in buying the
site, which is rated as one of the most desirable in Germany's financial
capital.
Difa, which is closely associated with DG Bank, is ranked among the top five
open-ended property funds in Germany, with total assets of around DM7.5bn.
It was advised in the Metallgesellschaft deal by Jones Lang Wootton.
The announcement of the disposal followed a confident statement from Mr Kajo
Neukirchen, chairman, who said the group's liquidity situation had never
been better.
In a letter to staff, he said the disposals programme started early this
year as one of the conditions of a DM3.4bn rescue package assembled by
creditor banks and share-holders was by and large complete.

FT  01 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Bank chief calls for
supervision rethink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jose Perez, director-general for banking supervision at the Bank of
Spain, says banks are bearing a heavier burden of regulation than ideally
required to minimise costs to the financial system, John Gapper writes from
Madrid.
He told an FT conference on international banking in Madrid that initiatives
such as the Basle Committee's proposals to allow banks to use internal risk
models to allocate capital for trading could lessen the burden by changing
the 'style and quality' of supervision.
He suggested costs could also be reduced by managers and supervisors jointly
designing databases for each bank. This would allow both groups to obtain
relevant information immediately and at lower cost.
Mr Perez said the multiplication of capital requirements meant that
supervisors were 'at risk of applying rules that are as complex as they are
lacking in accuracy'.

FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Fortnum &amp; Mason up 15%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fortnum &amp; Mason, the department store company 89.8 per cent owned by
Wittington Investments, reported that the improvement seen in the first six
months continued in the second half of the year to July 9 resulting in
record pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.31m.
That was a 15 per cent increase on the previous Pounds 2.01m. Turnover was
up 12 per cent from Pounds 24.7m to Pounds 27.6m with exports up by 49 per
cent.
Mr Garry Weston, chairman, said that present trading had been affected by
the rail strikes and the hot weather in the first few weeks of this year but
exports continued to be buoyant.
Earnings per share were 368p (311p) and the second interim dividend is
raised to 24p making a total for the year of 110p (100p).

FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Inspec pays Dollars 17.3m for US foam maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inspec Group, the speciality chemicals company which came to the market
earlier this year, yesterday announced plans to expand in North America with
the Dollars 17.3m (Pounds 11m) acquisition of Imitech, the US foam
manufacturer.
The deal, the first since Inspec's Pounds 49.5m flotation in March, will be
funded from cash reserves and new borrowing facilities totalling Dollars
17.5m.
'It will increase turnover by about 14 per cent and boost the level of
earnings,' said Mr Jim Ratcliffe, managing director.
Although the acquisition will push gearing beyond 100 per cent on net
borrowings of Pounds 18m, Mr Ratcliffe said strong cash generation would
ensure interest cover of at least 12 times.
Imitech, a subsidiary of Albemarle, the US chemicals business, claims to be
the only global producer of polyimide foam, used mostly in insulating naval
vessels and aircraft fuselages.
In the 12 months to last December it made pre-exceptional operating profits
of Dollars 2.7m on sales of Dollars 15.2m.
The deal follows five months of talks with Albemarle - the former speciality
chemicals arm of Ethyl - which first came to Inspec's attention as a
supplier to Allco, its US speciality acids business.

FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: All-round growth boosts Chesterton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chesterton International, the property agency and consultancy which made its
Stock Exchange debut in June, has reported an increase in full year pre-tax
profits from Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 5.2m, beating its forecast at flotation.
Turnover increased to Pounds 55.8m (Pounds 48.8m) reflecting growth in both
fee-earning advisory business and agency commissions. Agency income, which
depends heavily on the level of trading activity in the property market,
accounted for 31 per cent of turnover, up from 28 per cent.
Mr Giles Ballantine, chief executive, said all regions of the UK showed
strong growth. The company's offices in the North of England and Scotland
turned in especially strong performances, with turnover rising to Pounds
8.4m (Pounds 6m). Revenue from London offices grew by 12 per cent to Pounds
23.6m, about half of UK turnover.
Despite its position as one of the largest UK agents, Chesterton estimates
that its domestic market share is only 2-3 per cent. During the year it
acquired Consolidated FPM, the facilities management company and Conroy
Hunter, the Scottish property agency.
Chesterton also formed a joint venture with Binswanger, the US property
consultancy, to handle facilities management projects for multinational
clients.
Turnover in property management rose from Pounds 9.8m to Pounds 10.75m;
professional advisory work, including rating and valuations, from Pounds
15.5m to Pounds 16.4m and specialist services from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds
6.25m.
Overseas turnover was Pounds 4m, up from 2.9m.
Earnings per share were 7.1p, against 5.8p.

FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Higher sales to US boost Renishaw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Higher sales to its main market in the US helped Renishaw, the specialist
measuring equipment group that exports 91 per cent of its output, to lift
annual profits by 15 per cent.
The shares closed ahead 11p at 288p yesterday.
Pre-tax profits in the year to end June 30 rose from Pounds 7.14m to Pounds
8.2m on total sales ahead from Pounds 48m to Pounds 50.9m. Operating profits
were ahead from Pounds 4.94m to Pounds 7.17m.
Sales in the US grew by almost 15 per cent from Pounds 17.2m to Pounds
19.7m. Mr Ben Taylor, assistant chief executive, said that the US economy
was improving enough to bring benefits.
In addition, the group had been successful in selling so-called retrofit
products - equipment that can be fitted to improve existing machining
centres' control systems.
In contrast, sales to Germany fell from Pounds 8.44m to Pounds 6.83m, while
sales to Japan eased from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 5.8m. This was offset by
improving sales to other overseas countries (up from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds
6m) as the group developed new markets in Korea, Taiwan, India, Malaysia and
Hong Kong.
It also opened offices in Singapore and Beijing.
The group, which successfully brought a new Pounds 1.5m machining facility
on stream last April, spent Pounds 3.5m on research and development and
Pounds 2.5m on associated engineering. It intends to maintain expenditure at
the same levels this year, and will be launching further new prod-ucts.
Interest receivable fell from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 1.05m because of lower
rates. Net cash rose from Pounds 19.4m to Pounds 22.2m.
Earnings per share rose from 10.3p to 12p. A final dividend of 4.4p (4p) is
proposed, taking the total for the year to 6.9p (6.5p).
The group is also making a 1-for-10 scrip issue.
COMMENT
A buoyant final quarter brought Renishaw in ahead of expectations. With its
high operational gearing, it does not take much of an increase in turnover
to move profits, and substantial improvements appear in sight. Its new
scanning devices and the Raman imaging microscopes are selling well, and the
group is keeping the pressure up on both new products and the search for new
markets. At the same time costs have been tightly controlled, and it is
generating cash. Interest rates have also moved in its favour. Like-for-like
sales in Germany and Japan are up in the first months of this year,
indicating further benefits to come. However, this is reflected in a
prospective multiple of 21 if profits hit Pounds 9.5m this year.

FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Games Workshop scales down float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Games Workshop, a supplier of model war games systems, yesterday became the
latest casualty of investor unease towards new issues when its prospectus
revealed a scaling back of its forthcoming flotation.
The company had been aiming to raise Pounds 20m through a placing and free
float.
However, it now intends to raise just Pounds 12m, and only from
institutions. The reduction was blamed on the poor prevailing market
conditions, rather than investor reluctance to support such a unique
flotation.
The shares are to be priced at 115p, capitalising the company at Pounds 36m,
several million pounds below the level being touted by the board when the
flotation was first announ-ced at the beginning of September.
Dealings are due to begin on October 6.
The placing price represents an historic pro forma p/e ratio of 11.2 on
earnings per share of 10.3p for the year ended May 29 1994.
The notional gross dividend yield is 5 per cent.
The directors are forecasting operating profits of not less than Pounds 2.5m
for the six months to November 27 1994, compared with Pounds 2.1m and an
interim dividend of 1.5p per share to be paid in April 1995.
Games Workshop was the subject of a Pounds 10m managementbuy-out three years
ago. It designs, manufactures and markets futuristic war games complete with
figures and rules, which it then controls and supplements with developments.
The customers are predominantly male, between the ages of 10 and 17, who
keep up with the latest changes through the company's own magazine, White
Dwarf, which sells some 60,000 copies a month.
Most of the UK business is done through the group's network of 75 shops.

FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Hi-Tec Sports shares dive 33p - Warning
that margins will continue to slide follows losses of Pounds 7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Hi-Tec Sports tumbled by 33p to 45p yesterday as the sports shoe
and leisure wear company reported a fall into headline losses in the six
months to July 31 and suggested that margins would continue to slide until
at least the spring of 1995.
In a period of significant changes within the group, pre-tax profits of
Pounds 776,000 were turned into losses of Pounds 7.11m after exceptional
charges of Pounds 5.91m and interest payable Pounds 401,000 higher at Pounds
1.54m.
The restructuring was now over, said Mr Frank van Wezel, chairman and 53.19
per cent shareholder, and the loss-making activities had been 'dealt with'.
Apart from the closure of the European subsidiaries, the most important
event has been the disposal of 60 per cent of Cofex, the Dutch company which
makes fashion jackets under the Bad Boys brand name. In the period it
incurred unchanged trading losses of Pounds 1.95m, and accounted for Pounds
202,000 of interest charges and Pounds 5.1m in respect of goodwill
previously written off.
Mr van Wezel said that the losses this time masked underlying growth in the
the group's core rugged outdoor footwear and were different from the
recessionary losses of two years ago.
Group turnover edged ahead to Pounds 60.4m (Pounds 59.4m), including Pounds
3.73m from discontinued operations. On continuing activities, margins were
down about 2 per cent across the group. Stripping out Cofex, pre-tax profits
fell to Pounds 1m (Pounds 2.9m) on turnover up at Pounds 56.7m (Pounds
53.9m).
Mr Peter Butler said that having never been properly monitored, group stock
was now being managed at lower levels and that these stock reductions would
continue. Stock provisions had been raised by Pounds 500,000. Discounting
seasonal swings, debt had been reduced by Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 21.3m.
In North America, operating profits fell to Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 2m) on
turnover of Pounds 23.2m (Pounds 23.6m). Mr van Wezel said a sudden fall-off
in the fashionability of the Magnum law enforcement boots among urban youth
disguised a 22 per cent rise in sales of the core hiking boots. There was
also a hiatus when the group repositioned its products and withdrew them
from discount retailers. Some Pounds 4m of sales were lost.
In the UK and Ireland profits eased by Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 700,000 on
sales up 9 per cent to Pounds 21.6m. Sales of brown boots rose from 12 to 19
per cent of the total. South Africa did well since the elections, accounting
for some Pounds 5m of the rest of the world's Pounds 8.2m (Pounds 6.8m)
total. Profits were Pounds 500,000 (Pounds 700,000).
The group has changed its auditor from KPMG Peat Marwick to Touche Ross. It
has also changed its year-end from January 31, 'in the middle of our
delivery season' to April 30.
The interim dividend is 1.6p (1.25p), increased for the 15-month period. The
directors are taking up the scrip alternative, so the cash element is
covered 1.4 times, even though losses were 15.6p (earnings 1.4p) per share.
Forecasts for the year to January 31 have fallen to Pounds 2m or earnings of
3p, for a prospective multiple of 15.

FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Sindall in reverse takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in building contractor William Sindall were suspended yesterday as it
announced plans to reverse into an unlisted building company.
Sindall is paying an initial Pounds 12.2m for Morgan Lovell, an office
refurbishment company, through the issue of 18.5m shares and Pounds 1m cash.
Additionally, 4.4m shares are being issued through a placing and open offer
to raise Pounds 2.6m. This will cover the cash consideration and costs
relating to the takeover.
The new shares are being issued at 60p, against yesterday's closing price of
90p.
If Morgan Lovell meets financial targets for this financial year, up to a
further Pounds 1.35m will be payable in shares, which could leave its
vendors owning up to 66.5 per cent of the enlarged company.
The deal is subject to shareholders' approval at an extraordinary general
meeting on October 26.
Morgan Lovell was formed in 1977 and specialises in refurbishing and
fitting-out commercial property. In the year to March 31, the company had a
turnover of Pounds 59.8m and made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.3m.
Mr John Morgan, one of its founders, will become chief executive of the
combined company, which will be re-named Morgan Sindall.
Sindall also reported an interim pre-tax profit of Pounds 931,000 against a
loss of Pounds 619,000 last time. Turnover was down from Pounds 24.5m to
Pounds 22.2m.
However, the result was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 480,000
to cover property write-downs, redundancy costs and fees paid to advisers.
This was balanced by Pounds 1.65m exceptional gains arising from profits on
the disposal of fixed assets and amounts written back to current assets.

FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Union Square rights and reconstruction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union Square, the property investment and development group which suffered
heavily in the commercial property slump of the early 1990s, yesterday
announced a rights issue and capital reconstruction.
In a statement issued after the market closed, the group said it hoped to
raise Pounds 9.6m from a 1-for-1 rights issue at 5p per share. The shares
closed unchanged at 9p.
The move is designed to reduced the group's reliance on Thompson
Investments, its ultimate holding company, which last year advanced loans of
Pounds 10.8m to cover its debts.
Mr Richard Thompson, chairman of Union Square and managing director of
Thompson Investments, said the rights issue would increase shareholders'
funds to about Pounds 10.5m and would clear the way for a capital
reconstruction.
'Thompson Investments will swap their debt for equity, leaving it with a 79
per cent stake,' he added.
In the year to March 31, the property company made pre-tax profits of Pounds
212,000 (Pounds 83,000) on turnover of Pounds 3.81m (Pounds 1.75m),
including Pounds 2.36m from disposals.
Although dividends have been unpaid since 1990, Mr Thompson - also a
director of Queen's Park Rangers football club - forecast a resumption of
payments 'in a year or two'.

FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Ash &amp; Lacy advances 29%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An all-round divisional improvement at Ash &amp; Lacy together with higher
margins enabled the engineering group to raise pre-tax profits by 29 per
cent from Pounds 1.57m to Pounds 2.02m in the half year to July 1.
Turnover rose by 7 per cent to Pounds 30.6m (Pounds 28.7m). There was a
strong advance in UK galvanizing and non-ferrous metals, but manufacturing
and French galvanizing experienced further reduced activity.
Earnings per share came to 5.2p (3.77p) while the interim dividend has been
maintained at 2.5p.

FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Chairman of NFC to retire at end of year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just 10 weeks after the surprise departure of its chief executive, NFC
Holdings, the transport group, has announced that its chairman, Mr James
Watson, is to retire at the end of the year.
Mr Watson had increased his executive duties at the end of August, following
the sudden resignation of Mr Peter Sherlock. However he said he would not
delay his departure if a chief executive could not be found before December
19.
Mr Watson is to be replaced by Sir Christopher Bland, who made an estimated
Pounds 9m from selling his share options in LWT, of which he was chairman,
after it was acquired by Granada in February.
Mr Watson will be 60 at the end of the year, and he told non-executive
directors of his plans to retire last March.
Mr Watson said he wanted his replacement to play a key role in choosing the
new chief executive, and was keen for Sir Christopher to start as soon as
possible. He will work three days a week.
NFC's shares rose 5p to 181p yesterday, as Sir Christopher was seen as
likely to improve the company's image in the City, which had been shaken by
a string of disappointing results, and concerns over strategic direction.
Mr Sherlock was the first outsider to be brought into NFC at top management
level. He instigated a strategic review, merging the two largest
subsidiaries, and focusing on the group's higher value added businesses.
However, investors were disappointed by the amount of time it was taking for
the improvements to be translated into profits.
Mr Watson was key to the appointment of Mr Sherlock, who fought off internal
support for the candidacy of Mr Robbie Burns, a hands-on manager and
director who had successfully expanded NFC's logistics operations.
Mr Burns resigned earlier this year, but he reversed his decision after Mr
Sherlock's announcement. Analysts suggested that Mr Watson's retirement
might smooth the way for the appointment of Mr Burns as chief executive.
Mr Watson has worked with NFC since 1968, presiding over a dramatic
transformation of the company from a paternalistic Government logistics
group, to a substantial listed company.
He said he planned to focus on other business interests, which include the
chairmanship of Watson &amp; Philip, the Scottish retailer, and directorships of
National Express, Henlys Group and Gartmore.

FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Gestetner loses Pounds 6.1m on interest
rate swaps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Gestetner, the office equipment company, fell 23p to 123p
yesterday, after it announced it had made a Pounds 6.1m loss on interest
rate swaps, following the upswing in US and UK interests rates this year.
Mr Stephen King, finance director, said the board had been aware of a small
potential liability when it announced interim results in July, but only
recently discovered the full extent of its exposure. The positions have now
been closed.
Gestetner is re-evaluating its treasury operations and imp-roving controls
and reporting procedures, while Price Waterhouse is undertaking a full
investigation of the incident.
No board authorisation was required for the highly geared transaction which
involved a floating rate to fixed interest rate swap on Pounds 20m and
Dollars 20m (Pounds 13m), and senior management appears to have been slow to
react.
One analyst was shocked the new management had ext-ended Gestetner's
reputation for being accident prone. Forecasts for full year profits have
been reduced to about Pounds 15m.
Mr King said that trading continued to be in line with expectations, adding:
'We believe we are heading in the right direction, and this is just a
one-off aberration'.
The group has other treasury swap positions, but not of the same geared
nature. In 1993, the company made Pounds 4.2m of profits from closing
interest rate swaps.
Inchcape, the international services and marketing group, took a 15 per cent
stake in May 1993, and encouraged a number of management changes, and a cost
cutting programme which resulted in Pounds 48m of restructuring costs. It
recently lapsed its option to increase the holding to 25 per cent.
The management was seen to have put the core office and photographic
equipment distribution business back on a recovery track.
Inchcape's decision not to exercise its option was based on concern over
jeopardising its relationship with Ricoh, the Japanese photocopying company.
Inchcape paid about 129p a share. The company yesterday reiterated its
stance that it was happy with the investment.

FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Buying a spray to cut the mustard - Why
Reckitt &amp; Colman is selling its famous brand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What kind of company - and chief executive - can sell not one but both its
birthrights within six months?
Reckitt &amp; Colman is the company, Mr Vernon Sankey the chief executive and
Reckitt's Blue and Colman's Mustard are the birthrights with roots going
back 180 years. No products could be more synonymous with their maker.
Turning its back on clothes whiteners and English mustard, it aims to become
'one of the leading household products groups in the world' selling the
likes of air freshners, lavatory cleaners and disinfectants.
To that end it agreed to pay Dollars 1.55bn (Pounds 980m) this week for L&amp;F
Household, a US maker of such mundane products, and put Colman's up for sale
to help pay for it.
The news came out of the blue for Norwich, the East Anglian town which has
been home to Colman's since Jeremiah Colman started milling mustard near
there in 1814. Five generations later, the company is chaired by Sir Michael
Colman, the last employee from the family.
'There is a great deal of surprise and shock,' one citizen said. 'People
have found it difficult to come to terms with the sale and what might happen
to the 750 jobs here.'
Because Colman's is a bigger business than Blue and so closely identified
with Norwich, the psychological impact was far greater than Hull suffered in
March. The Humberside city where Isaac Reckitt built his enterprise from
1840 was then told that the business had been sold to Holliday Chemical.
The Colman's sale was also harder for the company.
'Emotionally it was very, very difficult,' Mr Sankey says, leaping up from a
chair in his London office and rushing over to the largest picture on the
wall. 'That was my office. That was my car,' he points out on an aerial
photograph of the Norwich operation. He began his Reckitt career there, aged
22, in 1971 and returned in 1985 to become managing director.
''How could you sell Colman's? We lived there', my two oldest children said
to me this week. But within a few minutes they understood the strategy
perfectly,' Mr Sankey says.
Apparently a highly persuasive communicator, he had also convinced Sir
Michael of the merits. Colman's would be better off with a food company
rather than a seller of household products, the chairman said earlier in the
week.
It was all part of the company's evolution, Mr Sankey says. Reckitt merged
with Colman in 1938 although they had been pooling their overseas activities
from 1913. The group continued to function in largely separate parts until
1970. Then, working to a blueprint from McKinzey, the management
consultants, it adopted a typical multinational's structure.
More importantly, the first historic roots were torn up: the headquarters
were moved from Hull to the west London home of Chiswick Products - of
Cherry Blossom shoe polish and Mansion floor polish fame  - which joined the
group in 1954.
The polish factory is long gone, its art deco office redeveloped into a
coolly modern block in the 1980s and the northern hemisphere chunk of the
shoe polish business sold in 1991.
Diversification gripped the group in the mid-1970s as it picked up makers of
beer kits in the UK and needlework kits in the US, wine makers in Australia
and jewellery makers in New Zealand to compensate for slow growth in its
core markets.
By 1980, however, Reckitt had decided it could grow the original businesses
if it focused on them. Divestments followed rapidly.
Three big acquisitions in the past 10 years - Airwick, Boyle-Midway and L&amp;F
for some Dollars 3.5bn - have pushed household products, toiletries and
over-the-counter drugs to the fore and food to the rear.
What was Mr Sankey's role in all this as a corporate strategist in the
1970s, a line manager in the UK, the Continent and the US in the 1980s and
chief executive since January 1992?
'I just happen to be the person at the front. Focusing on me would not help
in terms of the culture we're trying to develop to engage the hearts and
minds of the people in the company.'
Team work is the ethos, today's equivalent of the paternalistic concern of
the Victorian Reckitts and Colmans. Everybody goes through 'personal
development reviews'. 'We give mutual help on technical and personal
shortcomings,' Mr Sankey says.
Does he go through the process? 'Too right] Too right],' he says.
According to his colleagues he is trying to curb his inclination to chip in
his thoughts first and to make excessive demands on people. On the plus side
he is the modern team leader: hugely energetic, very encouraging, quick to
learn and analyse.
As yet, the City knows little of this side of Mr Sankey and Reckitt. It
likes the strategy but thinks the company is conservative and faces a stiff
management challenge to meet its global ambitions.
The company's shares fell sharply on news of the L&amp;F acquisition.

FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: ED&amp;F Man 1.2 times subscribed

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors who applied for more than 100,000 shares in ED&amp;F Man, one of the
world's largest commodities traders, will receive just 55,000 each.
The public offer of 15.3m shares at 180p was 1.2 times subscribed. Some
45.83m shares have been placed with institutions.
The shares will begin trading on Friday.
Schroders, the merchant bank advising Man, said there had been a wide spread
of smaller applications from private investors. Those seeking up to 1,000
shares were granted their full application.
Man announced plans to float in August. It was forced to cut its target
price after the sharp stock market decline. Man said the relatively modest
over-subscription was not surprising.
However, analysts have raised concerns about Man's dividend prospects. It is
coming to the market on a notional yield of 6 per cent.

FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: TJ Hughes jumps to Pounds 333,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TJ Hughes, the north-west based department store operator, nearly tripled
pre-tax profits from Pounds 115,000 to Pounds 333,000 in the half year to
July 30. The latest result however, included a 'one-off' Pounds 140,000
receipt arising from the purchase of a new distribution facility.
Turnover of the USM-quoted company grew 14 per cent to Pounds 21.1m (Pounds
18.6m) while like-for-like sales growth was over 6 per cent. Sales were
particularly strong in early spring and late summer, although TJ's earns the
majority of its full year profits - historically over 90 per cent of the
total - during its second half.
Earnings per share increased to 1.11p (0.39p) and the interim dividend has
been stepped up to 0.8p (0.75p).

FT  01 OCT 94 / History is not bunk: Washington's elite has beaten the hoi
polloi and Disney
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Image is everything,' says Andre Agassi, batting tennis balls off mountains
and the Queen of England in a TV commercial for a Japanese camera. It is a
contemporary truism with which this week the Walt Disney Company, creator of
images beyond number and phenomenally conscious of its own, could only
ruefully agree - after pulling the plug on its latest grand project.
In Washington, where most business is politics, there has not been a local
story for years quite like Disney's aborted history theme park next to a
civil war battlefield 35 miles outside the nation's capital. In comparison,
the ups and downs of presidents, senators, governors and mayors have seemed
almost trivial.
The park has pitted the elite against the hoi polloi, the horsey set against
the bus rider, environmentalists against advocates of economic growth,
historians against historians, even government against government.
It began last November when Disney announced it had taken an option to buy
3,000 acres of land just outside the small town of Haymarket in Prince
William County, Virginia, close to the killing fields of Manassas, as the
site for a 'historic theme park'. In January, it fleshed out the project,
envisaging 2,300 houses, 1,300 hotel rooms, and nearly 2m square feet of
retail space, to cater for 5m-6m visitors a year when it opened in 1998. The
price tag would be about Dollars 650m for the park, and Dollars 1bn for
everything.
Disney wanted state and county financial help - and got it. George Allen,
the newly installed Republican governor of Virginia, saw the project as the
leitmotif of his pro-business administration. In March, he rammed through
the state legislature Dollars 163m in grants. A week ago, Dollars 130m in
new road spending was authorised by county and state officials.
The federal government, however, was looking increasingly askance at issues
under its jurisdiction, including air and water quality and the widening of
interstate roads. Benjamin Forgey, the Washington Post's influential
architectural critic, also kept chipping in with pungent articles on the
dangers of urban sprawl. But Disney still believed it would win the
bureaucratic wars.
It was the image war that felled it. Haymarket is a modest town, near
Highway 66. But it is a gateway to the rolling Virginia Piedmont valleys
that contain some of the finest horse country estates in the east - filled
with weekend retreats for Washington's powerful.
These include the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Jack Kent Cooke, who owns
the Washington Redskins football team, Pamela Harriman, US ambassador to
France, Senator John Warner of Virginia, once married to Elizabeth Taylor,
Alice Marriott of the hotel family, the Graham family of the Washington
Post, and media glitterati by the dozen.
Their mood was exquisitely captured in a Washington Post article in April
headlined; ' Eeeeek] A Mouse] Step on it]' But these influential and
sophisticated people - some of whom listened to the populist talk shows
favouring the Disney plan - knew they needed better arguments than the
preservation of their comfortable lifestyles from hordes of Coke-swilling,
shorts-wearing tourists in buses and rental cars.
They got them from the guardians of America's heritage. A Who's Who of US
historians, many hardened by the bitter battles of academe, leapt into the
fray. The most prominent included David McCullough (Harry Truman and the
Panama Canal and president of the Society of American Historians), Arthur
Schlesinger Jr (THE authority on presidents), James McPherson, C Vann
Woodward and Shelby Foote (all doyens of the civil war and the south).
Disney mustered a couple of tame historians of its own, but they were
outnumbered and outclassed. They were also hampered by the fact that it was
never exactly clear how the company intended to depict 'history' in its
theme park, beyond the idea of a 'water ride' in the manner of Lewis and
Clark, the early American explorers.
The anti-Disney historians, calling themselves Project Historic America,
focused their fire on two fronts. For a start, they could not see the point
of locating the project within an hour's drive of 16 civil war battlesites,
13 historic towns and 17 historic districts, most of which have indeed been
lovingly preserved, including Manassas itself.
The second string to their bow might have been borrowed from the French,
always ranting on about American cultural imperialism. As David McCullough
put it: 'We have so little left that is authentic and real. To replace what
we have with plastic, contrived history, mechanical history, is almost
sacrilege.'
When Congress finally got into the act with hearings in June, this was the
message they heard - that US history was too important to be left to Disney
to reinterpret. Disney executives, Governor Allen and county officials all
weighed in with counter-arguments, but the public relations war among the
opinion makers was one-sided.
Even so, the idea that Disney gave up simply to avoid the disastrous image
of historians and socialites lying before its tractors stretches credulity -
even for a company known above all for its lovable Mouse, Duck, Snow White
and Lion King.
However the battle to overcome such opposition is not what a stretched
Disney management, weakened by death, illness and resignation, needs at
present. With attendance flat or down at all of its theme parks except Tokyo
(where the Japanese have no problems with American history), but its
animated film division on a huge roll, the company is casting around for new
directions - most likely into commercial television.
So it has folded its Haymarket tent. Local businessmen said yesterday they
were sad, but in the Piedmont valleys the white wine spritzers will be
flowing freely this weekend.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Testing journey to the party's roots: Tony Blair, UK
opposition leader, needs to prove Labour shares his policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair has a straightforward task next week. He must demonstrate he
can command the party he was elected to lead. When he has done that, he can
begin the tougher job of making Labour safe for government.
Since his leadership victory in July, he has chosen to address a wider
audience than the activists gathering in Blackpool for their annual
conference.
The voters of middle England have been told that here is a Labour leader
they can trust. Mr Blair understands economic realities; he is no friend of
yobs or criminals; he cares more about discipline than political correctness
in the classroom.
The prospectus has been an attractive one. The unusually kind (occasionally
gullible) media have applauded his youthful self-confidence. The
Conservatives have been wrong-footed, unsure whether to attack him directly
or to concentrate their fire on the unreconstructed socialists lurking in
the shadows.
But the new leader has to show that a message tailored to the aspirant
classes of southern England has the consent - let alone the enthusiasm  - of
his party's activists.
After 15 years in the political wilderness, its leadership has rid Labour of
the self-indulgent extremism which ensured the electoral defeats of the
1980s. At its roots, though, many prefer still the party's heart to its
head. The activists cling to the comfortable certainties of postwar
Labourism.
An inviolate welfare state, a tax system that redistributes wealth and a
privileged place in society for the unions head the list of cherished icons.
Mr Blair comes as a stranger to the culture of activism. Despite his
overwhelming leadership victory over Mr John Prescott and Mrs Margaret
Beckett, he is better known in the media than within his own party.
His spell after the 1992 general election as home affairs spokesman gave him
a profile as a politician who preferred the instincts of the respectable
working classes to those of the liberal intelligentsia in shaping his
approach to crime.
But unlike Mr Neil Kinnock or Mr John Smith, he has never been a party
insider, a politician at home in the smoke-filled rooms in which Labour
traditionally has done its business.
Even among many Labour MPs the unclubbable Mr Blair is an unknown quantity.
More than one shadow spokesman has sought the advice of journalists at
Westminster on how they should approach the new leader.
Some on the far left are already talking the familiar language of
'betrayal'. There are mutterings higher up in the party about the leader's
habit of reinterpreting in interviews long-cherished policies.
The traditionalists in the unions will be looking for the moment to reassert
their influence. During the conference debate on the economy they will test
his commitment to a minimum wage.
Leadership pledges to spend only what the nation can afford do not win
cheers at Labour conferences.
Mr Blair has sought to anticipate the critics. His strategy has been to use
the leadership honeymoon to seize as much ground as possible for the
modernising cause. In spite of their different backgrounds and one or two
private differences, Mr Prescott has proved a loyal deputy.
So the Labour leader hijacked a routine press conference on education policy
to emphasise his sympathies lay with the concerns of parents rather than
with the narrow interests of the teaching unions.
He also shunted Mr Larry Whitty out of the post of general secretary at
Labour's Walworth Road headquarters. Mr Whitty was too close to the old,
traditionalist guard.
Then there were the carefully scripted home truths delivered to the Trades
Union Congress in Blackpool. His declaration that there would be no favours
for the unions was followed by a shift in policy on Ireland to tilt the
party away from its traditional attachment to the nationalist cause.
This week was chosen to stake out his territory on the economy. Statist
solutions were no longer relevant. Nor were the old divisions between
private and public sectors. A Labour government would not seek to spend its
way to prosperity.
Crucially, the party's social ambitions could not be met by pushing up
taxes. A better health service and help for the poor could be delivered only
through economic growth. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, reinforced
the message with an exhaustive review of the constraints imposed by the
realities of international competition and technological change.
In some ways the symbolism was more important than the substance. Mr Blair
is not willing yet to talk in detail about tax and spending. Mr Kinnock and
Mr Smith before him had already jettisoned much of the ideological baggage.
But the terms of Mr Blair's enthusiastic embrace of the market economy made
it sound like he meant it.
So the party will discover in Blackpool that it has ditched 50 years of
attachment to the fatally seductive vision of a socialist paradise created
by pulling a few economic levers or nationalising half a dozen industries.
Mr Blair has to start putting something in its place.
The Labour leader, we are told, has some answers. His speech in the Empress
Ballroom on Tuesday afternoon, the most important of his political life,
will start to fill the vacuum.
It will offer a programme to modernise industry and create a competitive
economy; and a nation at work not on benefit. An education and training
revolution and a willing partnership between public and private sectors
rather than old-fashioned demand management will provide the instrument of
change.
The promise of economic competence and social improvement will be
accompanied by Mr Blair's new emphasis on social responsibility. A
commitment to the notion of society involves an equivalent determination to
stamp out antisocial behaviour. It also means higher standards in government
and the replacement of quangos with accountable democracy.
He calls this ethical socialism. A more accurate description is social
democracy. The basic judgment (shared incidentally by many senior
Conservatives) is that the election will be won by the party which promises
opportunity and security in a turbulent, unpredictable world.
The overwhelming advantage that Mr Blair has over his predecessors is that
his ideas match his image. He looks and sounds modern, reasonable,
intelligent. This week's opinion polls have underlined the strength of his
position - and the potential market for his message.
But the language of principles is not enough. Mr Blair has to offer
substance if he is to provide definition to the sometimes vague rhetoric. He
must convince us also that his party's policies are indistinguishable from
his own.

Sir, I am not surprised Colin Amery did not like the results of the
architectural competitions for the South Bank and Cardiff Bay Opera House
(Architecture: 'The tyranny of the few', September 26). Everyone to his
taste. Not everyone likes the results of the architectural competitions in
which Amery has sat on the jury. No one would argue that those results
brought the competitions system into disrepute.
I cannot comment on the lay jurors that Amery has dealt with, but I have yet
to come across a group of lay judges who quietly acquiesced in the views of
overpoweringly articulate architects.
Architectural competitions have been designed to be the very opposite of
'jobs for the boys'. On the day Amery's piece appeared, the RIBA-run
anonymous competition for the conversion of Baltic Mills in Gateshead was
won by a Dominic Williams, an 'unknown' architect, the 29-year-old
antithesis of an old boy. This RIBA competition gave an architect, too young
to be 'fashionable' in Amery's sense, the opportunity to win an important
commission.
Gateshead has set the standard for lottery-funded projects. I can think of
no better way than properly run architectural competitions for harnessing
the broadest range of architectural talent to meet a variety of emerging
needs.

Sir, With reference to the note 'A rash move' (Observer, September 27), the
link between Peaudouce and Ladbroke's Vernons is clearly pools. A man as

FT  01 OCT 94 / Sea change in UK defence: The planned link between BAe and
VSEL
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The contrast between jet fighters which roar through the stratosphere at
twice the speed of sound and nuclear submarines which creep silently through
the ocean depths could hardly be more extreme.
But that is the breadth of businesses British Aerospace is aiming to span if
it can bring to a successful conclusion the current negotiations to buy the
Barrow-based submarine maker VSEL. The two companies are locked in private
discussions about the price at which a friendly takeover might take place.
However, the fact that talks are taking place at all is another
demonstration of the way in which the cut in global defence spending is
forcing companies to consider mergers and alliances that would have been
inconceivable five years ago.
The catalyst for a deal between the two companies is a battle over the
contract for the next batch of nuclear hunter-killer submarines for the
Royal Navy. In 18 months the ministry of defence will award a contract for
up to five Trafalgar class submarines, worth around Pounds 2.5bn. The
contract will not go to VSEL on the nod, as it has done with previous
orders.
Thus far, the government has viewed nuclear submarines as a secret and vital
technology that cannot be fully subject to the competitive purchasing
reforms which have brought efficiency gains to other parts of the arms
procurement programme. Now the cold war is over, the MoD has the confidence
to demand a fixed-price bid to build the new submarines from a risk-taking
prime contractor who will bear the losses if the programme runs over budget.
VSEL badly needs the order. Submarines are its main business, and if the
next batch of Trafalgars goes elsewhere, the company will have little work
for its vast covered Devonshire Dock Hall in Barrow.
Yet VSEL is a small company, and has found it hard to persuade the MoD that
it can take the risks involved on such a large contract. To bolster its
chances, the company has husbanded the Pounds 250m of cash which it has made
from the Trident nuclear missile submarines over the past decade. It has
also formed an alliance with the US electronics company Loral, which would
provide the submarine's complex electronics, and the skills in integrating
them into the boat.
However, the decline in UK defence spending means that other predators are
after the Trafalgar prize. Both GEC and BAe want to bid, and both have
advantages.
GEC owns the Yarrow shipyard on the Clyde where some of the Trafalgar work
could be done. It also has enormous cash resources to back any bid, and is
keen to expand further into prime contracting rather than merely supply
components and sub-assemblies to BAe.
BAe has no such reserves, but does have more experience than any other
British company in managing large defence contracts. Bringing the millions
of electronic components together and wiring them into a submarine hull -
rather like making a ship in bottle - offers similar technical and
managerial challenges to those of making advanced fighters.
BAe is also keen to expand from being the prime contractor for aircraft to
being the dominant defence contractor. It is already involved in the Horizon
programme to produce the new generation of frigate, and its joint venture,
BAeSema makes ship and submarine command and control systems.
With two giants fighting over the shrinking procurement budget, VSEL is in
danger of being squeezed out. It had considered a alliance with DML, the
company which operates the Devonport dockyard in Plymouth. DML's work in
refitting nuclear submarines is similar to the construction of the boats at
Barrow, and there are many overlaps in the work.
In the event, VSEL seems to have opted for the friendly embrace of one of
the giants. Becoming part of BAe would give it the credibility it needs to
become a prime contractor, while furthering BAe's ambitions in naval
engineering. Such a deal would be financially advantageous for BAe: buying
VSEL with shares would strengthen its balance sheet, while VSEL's large cash
pile would cut BAe's debt substantially.
GEC could yet frustrate BAe's plans by counter-bidding for VSEL. It could
offer hard cash from its Pounds 2.9bn reserve which might well be more
attractive than BAe's shares to VSEL's shareholders. However, GEC has looked
at the submarine maker and decided not to bid, saying that it could win the
Trafalgar contract without owning VSEL.
The BAe approach alters the balance of power, and GEC may reconsider.
However, the MoD might then raise objections, unhappy that a single company
owns two of the remaining shipyards in the UK.
If BAe wins, it could use the cash in VSEL's balance sheet to back bids for
other contracts, such as the Future Large Aircraft military transporter, or
to help rationalise its commercial aircraft operations.
However, the real motive of the deal is industrial consolidation. Declining
defence spending is forcing companies to cut overheads, and mergers are the
most obvious way to eliminate costs. In the US the process is proceeding
rapidly, but the political barriers to concentration in Europe mean that the
process has been slower.
Outright cross-border mergers between, for example, BAe and Dassault of
France or DASA of Germany to produce one large military aircraft company
would almost certainly be stopped by national rivalries and security
concerns.
Faced with limited opportunities on the continent, UK arms companies are
consolidating across business areas at home. Earlier this year GKN, the
engineering company which makes the Warrior armoured personnel carrier,
bought Westland, the helicopter maker. The two are now being integrated into
a single defence division with a unified management structure and marketing
team.
Since merger talks between GEC and BAe broke down a year ago, the UK defence
industry has polarised further into two camps. BAe is trying to extend its
stranglehold of large project management and the integration of complex
systems to make complete military hardware. It wants to build fast jets,
transport aircraft, attack helicopters, ships and submarines and would
probably have tried to buy Westland if GKN had not started with an almost
unstoppable shareholding.
GEC has also been extending its stranglehold on the electronics and avionics
business. In the past year, for example, it has acquired most of the
remnants of Ferranti from the receivers. Both are, however, hedging their
bets by forming cross-border alliances, GEC with Thomson of France in sonar,
BAe with Matra of France in missiles. More such deals are likely to follow
and both companies are also both involved in the biggest collaborative
programme of all, the Eurofighter.
The bid for VSEL is part of the first phase in European defence
consolidation. The next, and larger, phase will be the decisive one with the
two UK camps either merging with each other or combining with similar
companies on the continent. Which route is taken will depend on whether the
political reluctance to contemplate a truly European defence industry thaws
faster than the opposition within BAe to a merger with its old rival.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Improved skills will be answer to
contracting European workforce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON DAWES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your Business Locations supplement (September 27), Philip Coggan
addressed the problem of Europe's high manufacturing cost base relative to
Pacific Rim economies. He reviewed the argument that Europe needs to
concentrate on technological development, but pointed out that this will not
necessarily reduce unemployment. He cited an economist's view that 'what is
causing Europe's problems is structural unemployment caused by technological
change'.
The following article by Eva Kaluzynska examined the European problem of an
ageing population and a low birth rate which implies a future shortage of
labour. She quoted a number of experts who suggest a variety of solutions,
ranging from later retirement to increasing the rate of female participation
in the workforce.
The problem of a small workforce having to support an ageing population is a
real one and the tide of technological change is unlikely to change. Moves
to expand the total workforce, assuming Europe does not follow the US route
of creating more unskilled and low-paid jobs, would be unhelpful. The
solution must lie in improving the education and skills of the reducing
numbers coming into employment and encouraging those already in employment
to make greater provision for their retirement.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Elderly's mortgage worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A B CRAVEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The survey by BMRB for the Building Societies Association referred to
by Alison Smith ('Societies hang on to homely image', September 22) may be
accurate in its conclusions as to how building societies are regarded by the
public. However, it would appear to ignore the feelings of one section, the
elderly.
In particular, it ignores the feelings of 10,000 to 15,000 old age
pensioners who were given mortgages known as equity release schemes in the
late 1980s. These were taken up by pensioners with little income to speak
of, because of glowing reports by the building societies on how property
values would rise over the years.
The opinions of financial advisers and building societies have proved
disastrous and have left the majority of the elderly concerned, with
mortgage debts rolling up at a horrendous rate.
The attitude to these problems by the building societies can only be
described as callous and intransigent. When the Home Income Plan Support
Group raised the matter with the BSA, its deputy director-general responded
by denying any liability on the part of the building societies. In time he
may well prove to be in error.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J HAMILTON STUTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The circular which has just been sent by Lloyd's debt collectors to
some 14,000 Names contains the truly astonishing statement that '. . . any
claim you may have against third parties (such as your member's and other
agents) does not affect your liability to make payments to Lloyd's
immediately'.
So our member's and managing agents, the people to whom Names have entrusted
all their savings, are 'third parties', ie nothing to do with Lloyd's] This
has never before been stated to me in my 16 years as a Name and was
certainly never mentioned when I joined, or there is no way I, along with
tens of thousands of other unfortunate Names, would have signed up.
What more skulduggery can we now expect from a society which spends Names'
money to try to prove in the courts that they have no 'duty of care' to
Names? Lloyd's has once again proved itself both incompetent and unworthy of
self-regulation. The sooner this is rescinded and Lloyd's Council is made
aware that its first duty is to Names, rather than policy holders, the
better.

FT  01 OCT 94 / What future for the ferry?: Questions raised by the Baltic
tragedy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Somehow, it has happened again. Seven years after the British vehicle ferry
Herald of Free Enterprise capsized off Zeebrugge with the loss of 193 lives,
the Estonia disaster has focused world attention on a question that
shipowners hoped had gone away: are roll-on, roll-off ships like these
inherently unsafe?
The answer will depend on the conclusions of the various inquiries into the
Estonia sinking, now thought to have cost more than 900 lives. But if the
inquiries decide, as seems likely, that the Estonia sank because water
entered the vehicle deck, the consequences for the ferry industry will be
dramatic.
At the least, public opinion could force governments to insist on expensive
structural changes, making new ships less able to compete with aircraft and
undersea train services like those through the Channel tunnel. At worst,
shipowners could be forced to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on
rebuilding existing ships to tougher safety standards.
That would have serious economic implications, especially in Europe, where
the speed and flexibility of vehicle ferries has made them indispensable to
trade between continental Europe and the outlying economies in the British
Isles and Scandinavia. There are more than 500 ferry sailings across the
North Sea and the English Channel every day; worldwide, the number of such
ferries in use has risen to 2,158 this year from 1,847 when the Herald
capsized. No-one knows how much traffic these ferries carry, but they have
the capacity to carry 9m gross tons of traffic a day - a third more than
seven years ago.
The talk in shipping circles yesterday was of waiting to see what caused the
Estonia to sink, of not jumping to conclusions, of the possibility that the
disaster could have been caused by anything from an engine explosion to a
mine from the second world war. But all the signs point towards a surge of
water entering the vehicle deck through one of the main doors.
Much has been done to improve the safety of roll-on, roll-off ferries since
1987. The International Maritime Organisation, the United Nations agency for
shipping, agreed in 1988 to raise stability requirements for new ferries
from 1990 and in 1992 to phase in tougher requirements for older ships. The
rules also require improvements such as closed circuit television
supervision of vehicle decks, and lighting to help survivors of an accident
reach safety. Some shipowners have also fitted sponsons - stabilising bulges
just above the waterline, to improve stability, although there is no
requirement to do so.
The UK went further, passing domestic legislation requiring all ships
visiting UK ports to meet the full 1990 standards. This forced shipowners to
scrap older ferries that could not be improved, or to transfer them to
countries with less rigid safety standards.
However, neither the UK nor the IMO addressed the biggest danger of roll-on,
roll-off ferries - the open vehicle decks running from one end of the ship
to the other.
The design of such ships dates back to the 1950s, when trade was picking up
rapidly after the second world war. Shipowners realised that cargoes could
be transported more quickly and efficiently if cars and lorries could be
driven straight onto their ships at the dockside and off again at the end of
the journey. The easiest way to do that is provide one or more vehicle
decks, accessible through large doors in the hull, running the length of the
ship. The design works best if the deck is uninterrupted by walls - known to
mariners as bulkheads - which complicate vehicle loading.
The result is that the protection afforded by bulkheads below the vehicle
decks is undermined by a huge and vulnerable open space in the middle of the
ship. The space is perfectly safe while it remains dry. But small quantities
of water entering the vehicle decks can cause the ship to develop a heavy
list and to capsize within a few minutes.
An independent inquiry in the UK, conducted by Mr Justice Sheen after the
sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise, concluded that this problem,
called the free surface effect, was responsible for the disaster. The judge
concluded that forcing shipowners to place vertical transverse bulkheads
across vehicle decks would make roll-on, roll-off ferries uneconomic. The
IMO also avoided any mention of vehicle deck bulkheads in its 1990
standards, preferring to wait for the results of a UK-Danish technical study
on design and construction; the next stage of the report will be released in
November. But if the free surface effect sank the Estonia, the demand for
action is likely to become irresistible.
Pressure for tougher regulations has come from survivors of major accidents,
including the Herald sinking, who have given first hand accounts of the
chaos involved in a capsize. Survivors of the Estonia tragedy have similar
stories.
There is a wealth of expert opinion on their side. The late Professor Dick
Bishop, a leading naval architect who was also vice-president of Britain's
prestigious Royal Society, was a strong supporter of bulkheads. Mr Alan
Gilfillan, vice-chairman of the safety committee of the Royal Institution of
Naval Architects, said yesterday that the Estonia sinking reopened the
question of whether they should be made mandatory.
Most shipowners say that it cannot be done. Inserting transverse bulkheads
would cost up to Pounds 600,000 for each ship, and would probably destroy
their ability to compete with alternative forms of transport. Longitudinal
bulkheads, running from bow to stern, would pose fewer problems, but might
also be less effective, they say.
'These ships are inherently safe until something totally unexpected happens.
They have done a wonderful job for 30 years with very few accidents. It is
important that we wait for the result of the inquiries into the Estonia, and
don't jump to the wrong conclusions about what needs to be done,' said Mr
Jim Davis, chairman of the International Maritime Industries Forum, a
shipowners organisation.
Mr William O'Neil, the IMO secretary general, recognised the depth of
concern yesterday by ordering a review of vehicle ferries by the maritime
safety committee, which can amend international regulations subscribed to by
countries accounting for 97 per cent of world shipping tonnage. There are
many issues before the committee, including the extent to which roll-on
roll-off ferries can turn into death-traps in extreme circumstances.
Swedish and Finnish operators say their crews are regularly drilled to cope
with emergencies. But, as the Estonia showed, even the best-prepared crews
and passengers can be quickly overcome when a ship begins to list and sink.
The horrific reports from the Estonia of panic-stricken and disorientated
passengers clambering over one another are evidence that emergency plans do
not count for much in a ship that is capsizing or sinking rapidly. The
pictures of survivors and dead bodies in semi-swamped rubber rafts bear
testimony to the effectiveness of life boats in those circumstances.
They also add to the pressure on governments and shipowners to restore
public confidence about the safety of shipping. The lesson of the last seven
years, however, is that there are no easy answers.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Man in the News: Protectionist of the old school - Ernest
Hollings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senator Ernest 'Fritz' Hollings of South Carolina hopes to make this the
week that he changes the world.
Mr Hollings intends to try to scupper the legislative package needed to
implement the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in
the US.
As the chairman of both the Senate commerce committee and the appropriations
sub-committee, which controls the Commerce Department's budget, Mr Hollings
does have considerable influence on trade issues.
His resistance has stirred memories of the US congressional veto in the late
1940s that prevented the Gatt from becoming a permanent organisation, like
other children of the Bretton Woods conference such as the International
Monetary Fund or the World Bank.
However, the odds are strongly against Mr Hollings definitively derailing
this Gatt bill. But even the delay is a terrible frustration to President
Bill Clinton, who has already seen his hopes of reforming healthcare,
welfare and campaign finance blocked by a recalcitrant Congress.
Under the fast track procedure created to give presidents greater authority
to negotiate trade agreements, the Gatt legislation, sent to Congress by Mr
Clinton earlier this week, may not be amended.
Members do have the right to 45 legislative days to consider the package,
and Mr Hollings has promised that he will use that to hold hearings. 'I've
got my 45 days and I'm going to use every bit of my 45 days,' he said.
That would take Congress beyond next Friday, when it hopes to adjourn, and
even beyond November 8, when there will be elections for one third of the
seats in the Senate and all of the House of Representatives.
Using the calendar in this way is a standard legislative manoeuvre at the
end of a congressional session, as tempers wear thin and members grow
impatient to return to their districts to campaign.
Still in jeopardy are measures such as the reform of the Superfund
legislation governing the clean-up of toxic waste dumps, a bill to protect a
large acreage of Californian desert from development and the last of the 13
spending bills the Congress must pass each year, covering the District of
Columbia's budget.
But Mr Clinton has made it clear that completion of the Gatt is his highest
remaining legislative priority. While many other bills are allowed to die,
or are postponed, if they fall off the end of the legislative calendar,
Congress will be brought back to vote on the Gatt legislation.
Instead of adjourning, it will go into recess, while the clock continues
ticking on Mr Hollings's 45 days. Senate leaders announced yesterday that
the Senate will come back into session on November 30 and will probably vote
on the Gatt bill the next day.
The chances of a defeat for the Clinton administration in that vote are
slim. There is a substantial majority in both houses in support of the Gatt
legislation.
Thus, the delay is only that. It is extremely unlikely that Mr Hollings
could muster a simple majority of 51 votes in the Senate against the Gatt
bill. There is also an outside chance that manipulation of parliamentary
rules could raise the hurdle to 60 votes.
This is not Mr Hollings's first battle against a trade bill. An out-and-out
protectionist of the old school, he believes that the US regularly gives far
more than it gets in trade deals, thus 'tilting the playing field' away from
US producers and consumers.
In 1985, 1988 and 1990, he persuaded Congress to pass legislation imposing
import quotas on textiles, in a bid to protect one of his home state's
principal industries. All three times the legislation was subjected to
presidential vetoes.
His protectionism often veers into xenophobia and he is well known for his
anti-Japanese statements and beliefs. A humorist, who often has crowds of
lobbyists giggling in the aisles of his committee room, the many people that
he has offended regard Mr Hollings's humour as deeply streaked with cruelty
and racism.
Former Senator John Tower, who became the butt of Mr Hollings's acerbic
tongue during his unsuccessful attempt to win Senate confirmation as defence
secretary, called him 'the Senate bully'.
And black members of Congress were outraged last year when he quipped that
African government officials attend international trade conferences so they
can 'get a good square meal' rather than 'eating each other'.
But one aide said Mr Hollings was the first congressional committee chairman
to hire a black staff director and has hired more women and minorities for
his committee than any other Senate chairman.
Even his supporters say they do not know whether his mouth runs in a higher
gear than his discretion, or he simply does not care who he hurts with his
barbed remarks.
With his opposition to Gatt, Mr Hollings has hurt Mr Clinton and become, in
the process, the hero of a peculiar combination of right and left wing
opponents who say the Gatt's new World Trade Organisation will take away US
sovereignty and leave it unable to enforce its own consumer and
environmental laws.
'God Bless Fritz Hollings,' said Mr Patrick Buchanan, the conservative
commentator who ran against former President George Bush in the 1992
presidential election. 'We have 45 days to make the case for a new economics
of American patriotism.'
Some argue that Senator Hollings may even have done President Clinton a
favour. With tough elections ahead, there are many House members who would
also like to delay their vote until after the election. And some Republicans
who generally favour the Gatt agreement would, nevertheless, prefer to deny
Mr Clinton a legislative victory ahead of the election.
Most members, however, would rather be spared a lame-duck session of
Congress, and most US allies would rather do without the frustration of yet
another delay to completing the Gatt.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Estonians feel the pain: Reactions to the disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TALLINN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The sinking of the Estonia, a ship 50 per cent-owned by the Estonian state
and largely crewed by Estonians, has been a severe blow to this country of
1.6m people in only its fourth year of independence.
The disaster has directly affected a larger proportion of the nation than is
the case for Sweden, where most of the victims lived, or Finland, which
played an important role in the rescue operation.
Estonians also feel that it has thrown into question the competence and
efficiency of their country's shipping industry - and its ability to break
free from the inheritance of its past in the Soviet Union, where transport
was expected to be hazardous.
A large white cross has been placed on a grassy knoll near Tallinn's
Maritime Museum, with candles burning on both sides. Memorial services will
be held throughout Estonia tomorrow.
Ms Riina Taglis, a shop manager who had come to pay her respects at the
cross, said yesterday: 'For us it is like a horror, like a time after the
war when so many people were killed.'
This parallel was also used by Mr Mart Laar, the outgoing prime minister, in
comments he made in Finland on Thursday: he recalled the number of people
who drowned in 1944, escaping to Sweden in small boats when the Red Army
came back to Estonia.
The government has set up a fund to assist the families in distress. The
Estonian Cultural Foundation has also launched an appeal to build a monument
to the memory of the victims. And the weekly Eesti Express has already
collected over 560,000 kroons (Pounds 28,000) for its appeal on behalf of
the victims' families.
In an interview yesterday with the FT, Mr Laar emphasised that early
evidence showed the sinking of the ship was not the fault of Estonian crew
or procedures. 'We got information on Thursday night that, in the past 10
years, six other serious accidents had happened to ships of this type of
construction. There were no disasters because these accidents happened in
calm weather conditions. But in a Baltic storm the disaster happened.
'What seems to have taken place, from the reports I have had, is that the
front part of the ship seemed to fall away and the water flooded in. That
could not be crew failure and the inspection in Tallinn before the ferry
failed showed no problems. Some people talk of a loud noise, as of a
collision.'
This possibility has also been raised by the testimony of one of the first
Estonian survivors to come back to Tallinn, Mr Ain-Alar Johanson. On
Thursday night, he said he had heard a 'loud, metallic noise' a little
before the ship begun to sink.
Mr Indrek Tarand, top civil servant in the Estonian foreign ministry, said:
'Even though a ship called Estonia was wrecked and went to the bottom, it
doesn't mean that Estonia collapses - though this is a catastrophe that will
be remembered for centuries.'
Mr Ivar Raig, a member of parliament for the Rural Centre party, said: 'In
the short term, people will be worried about us - we may again be seen as a
country of disasters.
'But on the other hand it can show how far we are part of another world.
This was a ship built in Germany with mixed Swedish-Estonian ownership and
the rescue operations were carried out by Swedes, Finns and Estonians. It is
a common tragedy for all of these.'

FT  01 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Nagging at the recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By rights, it ought to be a quite a party in Madrid this weekend. For the
first time in several years, the finance ministers and central bankers of
the Group of Seven largest industrial countries all have growing economies,
with barely a hint of inflation to go with it. Even the latest World
Economic Outlook from the International Monetary Fund allows itself to be
unusually upbeat about the state of the world recovery.
Who could ask for more? The IMF would not be the IMF if it did not see
reasons to worry, and corresponding room for improvement in many industrial
countries' monetary and fiscal policies. But finance ministers rarely pay
much attention to its straitlaced prescriptions: certainly not enough to let
it ruin a couple of days' sunshine and sangria.
The nagging of the financial markets, however, is more sobering. Every
downward lurch in American and European bond markets - like the one which
occurred this week - can mean another missed budget deficit target and,
possibly, another difficult round of tax increases and spending cuts. The
markets' worries may be less consistent than the IMF's, but the underlying
message is the same. Seizing today's opportunity for an unprecedented period
of global growth requires prices to remain stable, and public borrowing to
fall.
The good news is that the opportunity is there for the taking. As the IMF's
report states, 'the recovery of world activity and trade became firmly
established during the first half of 1994'. Overall, the organisation is
predicting 3 per cent growth in global output this year, a little more than
it thought likely when it produced its May Outlook.
Signs of recovery in continental Europe and Japan, and the growing momentum
behind the US and UK upswings, mean that the global growth figure hides less
diversity than before. The developing countries continue to grow fastest:
the IMF expects output of poorer countries to grow by over 5 1/2 per cent in
1994 and 1995. But the more sedate 2 3/4 per cent growth expected in both
years from the G7 countries compares well with the 1.4 per cent achieved in
1993.
Liberalisation
As the report shows, the global reach of the upturn owes much to the
widespread liberalisation of capital markets. As a group, the world's poorer
countries were able to attract annual net capital inflows of Dollars 94bn,
on average, in the first three years of the 1990s. The average figure for
the preceding seven years was a mere Dollars 9bn. This influx of investment
capital continues to play a large part in ensuring these markets 'emerge'.
There are familiar laggards in the global growth picture. Africa, for one,
has received little of the new investment flows, suffering slight net
outflows of capital in both periods. But the IMF expects that even Africa
will achieve 3.3 per cent growth this year, up from a meagre 1 per cent in
1993.
The world has not seen this combination of freely flowing capital and goods,
and near-universal economic growth, since the early years of this century.
Market sentiment
Why then are the financial markets determined to spoil the party? As the IMF
notes, long-term government bond yields have been on the rise world-wide,
increasing by an average of 2 per cent in industrial countries since
January. On Thursday, the yield on long-term US treasury bonds briefly
touched nearly 7.90 per cent, the highest in over two years.
Not every shift in market sentiment has a sound rationale. But the
underlying pressure on both nominal and real interest rates worldwide can be
traced to two doubts that did not cloud the picture in the early 20th
century. Then, the global capital market could rely on two things: stable
prices and a large pot of rich country savings.
Prices are again relatively stable in the main industrial countries: the IMF
estimates consumer prices will rise only 2.4 per cent in the course of 1994.
But the inflationary cycles of the 1970s and 1980s are too recent to be
forgotten. And low inflation came after a long recession that has left
unemployment at stubbornly high rates in Europe and elsewhere.
Thursday's US bond market fall, which was triggered by unexpectedly strong
economic data, follows a pattern which is likely to become familiar
elsewhere as the recovery takes hold. Investors worry that national monetary
authorities will not act quickly enough to stem inflation, because of
political pressures to deliver higher growth.
Yet not all of the rise in bond yields can be put down to inflation jitters.
The rise in index-linked government bonds in the UK and Canada since
February points to real pressures on investment funds. Partly, this is a
predictable result of the pick-up in the cycle. But it also stems from the
fact that governments, companies and developing countries are all borrowing
at the same time. Something has to give: the ministers and government
officials assembled in Madrid should decide it will be them.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Generators back nuclear sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The privatisation of the nuclear power industry yesterday received qualified
support from rival electricity generators as the consultation period for the
government's nuclear review closed.
The Association of Independent Electricity Producers, which includes former
state-owned generators National Power and PowerGen, urged the government to
'make every effort' to privatise the nuclear power industry.
However, it said nuclear power should be given 'no special advantage over
other privately owned generating businesses'.
National Power and PowerGen have not published their submissions but it is
understood they are sympathetic to privatisation. However they are thought
to have said that privatisation of Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear
would only be acceptable if 'subsidies', including the fossil fuel levy,
were phased out. The Pounds 1bn a year levy is scheduled to last until 1998.
The producers' association said the government 'must make quite clear that
investment in any new nuclear power stations should be on a full commercial
basis with investors judging the need for capacity'.
It pointed out that Nuclear Electric's own submission 'makes it quite clear
that electricity from new nuclear stations would not be competitive in
today's market'. It adds: 'Intervention in the electricity generation market
to protect the interests of one technology may damage the interest of those
who have to compete with that technology.' That could damage the interests
of the electricity consumers.
The association also questions the electricity industry's grid code which
treats nuclear plants as inflexible. The code 'means that when it is
necessary for stations to be turned off for grid management purposes,
nuclear stations are turned off last'. Although the submission says this may
have been appropriate before electricity privatisation, its justification in
the new market place should be re-examined.
The association argues that uncertainty about the bill for existing nuclear
liabilities has made the nuclear debate more complicated than it should have
been.
It says the government should clarify what the fossil fuel levy was intended
for.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Sub-postmasters seek sale pledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporter
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sub-postmasters yesterday demanded assurances that the Counters subsidiary
of the Post Office would not be 'asset-stripped' in order to benefit the
Royal Mail and Parcelforce divisions of the organisation.
The National Federation of Sub-Postmasters was commenting on government
plans to sell 51 per cent of Royal Mail and Parcelforce while keeping
Counters in the public sector. Yesterday was the deadline for comments on
the plans.
Mr Colin Baker, federation general secretary, said the government's
proposals for Counters could mean a more secure future for sub-postmasters
with opportunities for business growth.
'However, the fact remains that not all sub-offices can offer all
transactions - and that rural sub-offices in particular continue to close as
their viability is in doubt,' he added.
Strong support for the government plans came yesterday from the
Confederation of British Industry, which said the commercial freedom
generated by privatisation was critical to the future success of the postal
service because it faced stiff international competition.
Privatisation would 'bring further price and quality improvements benefiting
customers', the CBI added. New competitive pressures on providers of postal
services would benefit customers.
'Every business uses postal services, and for many companies the postal bill
is a major overhead,' the CBI said.
However, the unions and opposition parties are resolutely opposed to
privatisation in any form, repeating the stance they have taken with
virtually every privatisation over the last decade - most of which they no
longer propose to reverse.
Union and Labour leaders have highlighted the dramatic pay rises for senior
managers which have followed earlier privatisations. They also claim the
sell-off might endanger the letters service, and the 20,000 rural post
offices.
The 51 per cent sale of Royal Mail and Parcelforce is the government's
favoured option. About 10 per cent of the privatised company would be sold
to Post Office employees and to the staff managing sub post offices run on
contract for the Post Office.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Ofgas sets Pounds 15 delivery charge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A standing charge of Pounds 15 a year for mains gas delivery to domestic
customers was set yesterday by Ofgas, the industry regulator.
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, said she had set the charge
'in anticipation that the gas market will move to full competition in the
near future'.
As a monopoly, British Gas has not been required to break down its Pounds
37-a-year domestic standing charge between the costs of transportation and
of its trading division. But the planned liberalisation of the market
beginning in 1996 will led to the separation of the two functions.
Independent gas marketing companies welcomed the move, which they said
should lead to the standing charge being lowered in the run-up to
competition and after competition had been introduced.
British Gas yesterday announced the closure by the end of next year of its
research station at Killingworth, North Tyneside. Many of the 400 employees
will be offered jobs at its new consolidated research centre at
Loughborough, Leicestershire.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Capital tax break urged for industry
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Tory-led industry pressure group yesterday urged Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, to introduce 100 per cent capital allowances in the Budget next
month as part of a clear strategy for economic growth, David Owen writes.
The Manufacturing and Construction Industries Alliance - chaired by Mr
Nicholas Winterton, Conservative MP for Macclesfield - said the move was
vital to the future prosperity of the UK. The alliance also urged Mr Clarke
to avoid any further tax increases.
Mr Winterton said the government should 'give a boost to the economy'. He
added that this should be 'specifically through lower interest rates, the
introduction of 100 per cent capital allowances in the first year to
encourage industry to invest in the new facilities vital to our continued
competitiveness, and further, carefully targeted investment in the transport
infrastructure and the public-sector building stock'.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Accountancy bodies at loggerheads on reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
yesterday attacked a plan by the certified accountants' body for the reform
of the profession as 'dead on arrival'.
Mr Roger Lawson described the idea of a General Accounting Council for the
UK and Ireland as a 'wheeze' put forward by the Chartered Association of
Certified Accountants.
The dispute puts in serious doubt the ability of the profession's six
leading bodies to move forward with the so-called Bishop proposals for
reform.
That scheme, which is being presented to the memberships in various
consultation processes, envisages the merger of the six bodies on a regional
basis.
The association's plan, put forward by its president Mr John Moore, instead
urges the creation of a new umbrella group and the preservation of the
existing bodies.
While it defends the scheme as a genuine attempt to find a way forward for
all six leading bodies, it was seen as a serious blow to the Bishop plan.
Mr Lawson's reaction, delivered to a meeting of chartered accountants in the
Thames Valley area, was dismissive.
'The accountancy profession as a whole would have abdicated its
responsibilities to its members and to the public to some sort of quango of
questionable accountability.
'The principal effect of the recent idea put forward by ACCA would have been
to transfer effective control to a minority of government and other external
nominees.
'I cannot believe that that is what most of the accountancy profession would
have wanted. It is certainly not what I want to see for my members.
'For this critically important reason I regarded the ACCA idea as dead on
arrival, if not actually still-born.'
Mr Lawson said reform had to deliver better standards of qualification and
professional performance and a better use of resources.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Labour leaders look to transcend wages row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour leadership appeared hopeful last night that it could prevent a
row over the minimum wage from overshadowing Mr Tony Blair's plans to use
the party's Blackpool conference to set out the main planks of his electoral
strategy.
The last-minute efforts to defuse a potentially damaging dispute came as Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, reaffirmed the government's long-term
commitment to tax cuts.
In an attempt to regain some of the initiative after a week dominated by
Labour's efforts to discard its image as a high-spending, high-tax party, Mr
Clarke said the Conservatives would 're-establish with the voters that we
will deliver tax cuts when the economy can afford it'.
Mr Clarke offered no specific commitment on the timing - however he insisted
that the government's commitment to steady growth, low inflation and tight
control of public spending made lower taxes a question of 'when' not 'if'.
Mr Clarke's comments came in a letter to Conservative party constituency
chairmen. With a little more than a week to go until the Tory party
conference it said: 'Rushing into tax cuts in this coming Budget with
borrowing still high wouldn't have impressed anybody for very long.'
Labour party officials said the TGWU general union was increasingly isolated
in its insistence that Labour endorse a rigid formula to fix the level of a
minimum wage during Monday's opening conference debate on the economy.
Mr Blair wants the party to campaign on the principle of raising the pay of
low-paid workers rather than be drawn into internal arguments about a
particular level. A conference defeat on the issue would seriously dent his
authority but could be averted later today when officials and unions set the
precise terms of the planned debate.
That position has been backed forcefully by Mr John Prescott, the deputy
leader, who has used his considerable sway with the unions to warn against
an open conference split on the day before Mr Blair's first speech as
leader.
After this week's high-profile rejection of his party's past commitment to
high taxes and borrowing, Mr Blair intends to use the conference to show
that he now has a positive agenda on which to fight the Conservatives.
In a statement of his priorities later today, Mr Blair will set the central
themes as industrial and economic renewal, reform of the welfare state to
get people back into employment, and a commitment to social responsibility.
The statement, New Labour for New Britain, will represent the party as the
voice of the majority in contrast to the portrayed sectional interests
represented by the Conservatives.
Mr Blair will tell the conference that the party must be clearer in drawing
the dividing lines between the two parties and must shake off the perception
that it has been motivated by electoral expediency rather than firm
principles.

Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, has no plans to meet Mr Gerry Adams, US

continued campaign for a White House meeting.
'He will meet with officials from the State Department and White House at
the working level, but not here,' said Ms Dee Dee Myers, Mr Clinton's press
secretary.
Mr Adams visits Washington on Monday and Tuesday. It is thought that final
decisions on who will meet him were taken yesterday.
On his two-week tour of the US, Mr Adams has been campaigning steadily to
have his reception upgraded.
This week, Mr Rudolph Giuliani, mayor of New York, welcomed him as a
'harbinger of peace'. He added: 'I think President Clinton should greet
him.'
But the Clinton administration is sticking to its promise to the British
government that Mr Adams would not be received at the White House.

FT  01 OCT 94 / 'Man from the Pru' could be endangered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The insurance agent who collects regular cash payments from customers' homes
 -the 'man from the Pru' - could become an endangered species under
government proposals.
Ideas for streamlining or abolishing the separate arrangements for
industrial branch business - as this specific type of life insurance is
known - will be discussed in a consultation paper due to be published around
the turn of the year.
Under legislation from the 1920s, an agent for this type of business must
call at customers' homes to collect cash or cheques more often than every
two months and must initial in a premium receipt book the amounts paid.
The policies that agents can sell are also very limited and do not, for
example, include pensions. Nor, even though the emphasis is on simple
policies, are agents allowed to sell term assurance - policies which are
directed at protection without any investment element.
The costs of this labour-intensive system of collection are relatively high,
reducing the returns which would otherwise be available to customers.
Life companies specialising in this area acknowledge the expense involved,
but say that by accepting small premiums, often from people without bank
accounts, they are giving clients an opportunity to make provision for
themselves which they would not otherwise have.
As more people open bank accounts and life companies opt for less expensive
means of collection, the amount of new industrial branch business has been
slipping in recent years from 2.05m new policies in 1990 to 1.21m in 1993.
But there are more than 45m policies still in force.
Even though Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer, has
become synonymous with industrial branch business, the organisation has been
withdrawing from this area: in 1992 it raised its minimum premium from
Pounds 12 to Pounds 20 a month. It does, however, still have a 'home
service' sales force of agents who visit customers in their houses.

FT  01 OCT 94 / 1,000 advisers miss PIA deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some 1,000 independent financial advisers appeared yesterday to have
rejected regulation by the Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog
to protect the private investor. The deadline was at midnight.
Latest estimates from the authority suggested that about 4,300 of the 5,300
independent advisers who used to be regulated by Fimbra had applied to join
the PIA.
It will not be clear until next week how many of the non-applicants have
left financial services.
The strict deadline for applications was imposed by the Securities and
Investments Board, the chief City regulator, in June.
It said that by today all those in the retail financial services industry
who had not applied to the PIA should have done one of three other things.
They were: apply to be regulated directly by SIB or by a recognised
professional body; say they were joining a network of advisers or setting up
a 'tie' with a life company; signal their intention to leave the investment
business by the end of the year.
An independent adviser who failed to take any of the available courses would
lose authorisation. This would make it a criminal offence to continue
investment business, which would mean that customers would lose regulatory
protection. Anyone wanting to check the status of an adviser can contact SIB
central's register (071 929-3652).
PIA offices in central London, Croydon and Edinburgh were remaining open
until the midnight deadline in order to receive last-minute applications.
The regulator estimated it could have received as many as 700 applications
in the final week.
The controversy and uncertainty over the PIA's future until relatively
recently may have deterred some advisers from early application.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Labour attacks insurance tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party yesterday extended its attack on the government's recent
tax increases by claiming that the tax on insurance premiums which comes
into effect today will make it harder for the public to fight crime, James
Blitz writes.
Senior party figures said the tax would add Pounds 13.90 to the annual
average expenditure of British households.
Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the 2.5 per
cent tax on household and car insurance, introduced in the last Budget, was
another example of how the Tories had broken their pledge not to raise
taxation.
She said the tax would 'hit hardest at those living in high crime areas,
often the most disadvantaged parts of the country'. However, she refused to
give a commitment that Labour would abolish the tax if it came into
government.
Ms Harman signalled yesterday that Labour would try to highlight the impact
of the Conservative party's taxation policy by insisting that the net effect
of the government's last two Budgets had been to add 7p in the pound to the
basic rate of income tax.
She believed that the government might try to soften the impact of its
indirect taxes - including value added tax on fuel and reductions in
mortgage interest relief - by cutting direct taxation before the election.
'If that happens, we will respond by looking at how much that
7p-in-the-pound bill has been reduced,' she said.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Slower manufacturing growth signalled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hints that the recent acceleration in manufacturing growth may slow slightly
towards the end of the year emerged yesterday in a business survey.
The Purchasing Managers' Index fell for the second consecutive month in
September as the seasonally adjusted rate of growth in new manufacturing
orders dropped.
The index, compiled from data on stocks, output, orders, delivery times and
prices, was 59.6 per cent in September, down from 59.7 per cent in August
and 62.1 per cent in July. Any figure above 50 per cent indicates growth
from the previous month.
The results echo a recent Confederation of British Industry survey that also
suggested orders may slow.
With official production data due next week, these findings may add to the
debate about the government's recent decision to raise base rates to 5.75
per cent. Although the CBI survey was mainly carried out before the rise in
base rates, some business groups have argued that the move may hinder the
pace of industrial growth.
However, City economists have been predicting that the recent acceleration
in production growth would slacken towards the end of the year.
Manufacturing output grew 3.9 per cent in the year to July, and some
economists fear that a further acceleration might create capacity problems.
One example of these pressures came this week when British Steel admitted
that a recent rise in demand for structural steel sections for construction
work had forced it to close its export order book for these products for the
rest of the year. The last time rising demand had forced such a move was
during the boom in 1990, it said.
These growth pressures were also reflected in the Purchasing Managers'
Index, which showed that almost a third of companies faced increasing
problems in meeting delivery times.
The proportion of purchasing managers intending to raise prices fell
fractionally during the month.
Nevertheless, nearly half of the managers surveyed said they still envisaged
price rises, with the chemicals, rubbers, plastics, paper and packaging
industries reporting price increases.
The output index continued to rise, reaching a figure of 60.8 per cent,
suggesting that production continued to expand in September. However, new
orders fell to 60.6 per cent, down from 64.4 per cent the previous month.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Channel tunnel's car shuttle launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel yesterday launched the flagship shuttle service with which it
hopes to win half of the cross-Channel car passenger market by the end of
1996.
Car shuttles carrying staff, journalists and the winners of a Eurotunnel
travel competition made the 35-minute journey in the twin-deck,
air-conditioned shuttle trains.
On Monday, nearly 18 months later than originally planned, Eurotunnel will
start its Overture service with a trip for invited shareholders, bankers,
MPs and MEPs. It hopes to carry 60,000 passengers and 20,000 cars in the six
weeks of the introductory service.
The company has already received applications from more than 10,000 of its
UK shareholders alone and requests are arriving in their thousands every
day, Mr Christopher Garnett, commercial director, said. Shareholders, who
will be expected to pay Pounds 30 to cover administration costs, will be
selected by ballot.
The final price of tickets will not be announced until mid-November when
Eurotunnel plans a full service for car passengers.
Eurotunnel announced car shuttle fares in January when it expected to start
services in May. They ranged from Pounds 125 for a two-day return fare to
Pounds 310 for journeys on peak midsummer weekends. It withdrew these fares,
regarded as being quite high, when the launch was delayed.
Car passengers are expected to remain with their vehicles during the
crossing although they can move around on the narrow aisles beside their
cars.
Each of the almost half-mile-long shuttle trains can carry up to 180 cars or
120 cars and 12 coaches. Eurotunnel is beginning with one car shuttle an
hour but this will rise to four an hour when it is operating at full
capacity.
The blocked drainage pipes which led to the build up of water and disrupted
signalling in the tunnel may have to be replaced if they cannot be cleared,
Eurotunnel said. 'This is possibly a design fault,' Mr John Noulton, public
affairs director said.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Profitability hits five-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The profitability of UK industrial and commercial companies increased last
year reaching its highest level in percentage terms since 1989, figures
released yesterday by the Central Statistical Office show, Philip Coggan
writes.
The figures show companies' net rate of return, as measured by the ratio of
operating surpluses, or profits, to the capital stock employed. For
industrial and commercial companies, the rate of return was 8.4 per cent in
1993, up from 7 per cent in both 1991 and 1992.
Corporate profitability remains well below the 10 per cent recorded in 1988,
and the all-time peak of 12 per cent in 1964. But the rates of return earned
in 1991 and 1992 were above those recorded in the two previous recessions in
1975 and 1981.
If North Sea companies are excluded, the rate of return recorded last year
was lower, at 7.8 per cent. Manufacturing companies earned a return of just
5.8 per cent. However, both sectors recorded improvements over the returns
earned in 1991 and 1992.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Bottomley signals delay on NHS local pay deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, yesterday admitted that locally
determined pay could not be introduced comprehensively next year for
National Health Service workers.
She told the Trust Federation annual conference in Bournemouth that, like
the independent pay review bodies, she expected to see a move to local pay
in the NHS over the next few years. She described it as a 'natural
development' of trust status.
This appears to contradict evidence submitted by her department to the
independent pay review body for nurses and midwives last month. The
submission called for the body not to recommend an across-the-board
increase, but to speed moves towards local arrangements.
Meanwhile, the leader of the NHS Trust Federation - a group representing the
bulk of hospital trusts - warned that most hospitals would not be able to
make the move over the next six months.
Those that were successful were likely to introduce performance-related pay
in stages, starting with awards to health workers rather than core staff,
said Mr Rodney Walker, federation chairman.
In its evidence to the pay review body the department said it wanted 'a
strong steer to the continued development and implementation of local
arrangements by leaving employers with maximum scope for local action'. It
added: 'Clearly, any across-the-board recommendations would inhibit such
developments.'
Only about 11 NHS trusts, which include community and ambulance services as
well as hospitals, have introduced comprehensive local pay packages,
including performance-related pay.
Many trusts have expressed concern that they may not have the packages in
place by April, the date for review-body pay settlements, and the target set
by the NHS executive for local pay packages.
Unions representing nurses, which have submitted an 8.3 per cent pay claim
when the government is seeking a second annual total pay-bill freeze, said
they were bemused by the health department.
However, Mr Bob Abberley, head of the health division at Unison, said he was
not interested in the confusion. He said: 'We think the whole idea of
performance-related pay is daft and wrong and the best thing the government
can do is to drop the whole thing entirely.'
Mrs Bottomley said in her speech that local pay would only work if trusts
worked with staff, explaining and communicating every inch of the way. 'That
job starts now,' she said.

FT  01 OCT 94 / ITV to increase programmes budget to Pounds 550m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ITV companies have agreed an unprecedented network programme budget of
Pounds 550m for next year - a rise that is double the rate of inflation.
The figure, hammered out in talks between all the ITV companies, compares
with Pounds 527m for this year. The increase indicates that ITV is prepared
to keep investing to retain its ratings lead over the BBC, particularly in
popular drama.
The budget, excluding the cost of the news provided by Independent
Television News, might also include a further Pounds 2m as a contingency
fund.
Mr Marcus Plantin, director of the ITV Network Centre, which commissions the
national ITV schedule, said yesterday that Pounds 210m has been spent on
UK-produced drama. He announced the ITV peak-time schedule for 12 months
ahead - the first time a UK broadcaster has committed itself for a year.
Mr Plantin - speaking at an industry presentation to advertisers and
agencies - stepped up ITV efforts to expose what he called the myth of the
demise of terrestrial television.
'We have maintained our peak-time audience share for the past three years
now and have been hardly affected by cable and satellite television
penetration, which has happened much more slowly than predicted,' he said.
Mr Plantin said that ITV has maintained 'both its peak-time (audience) share
of around 44 per cent over the last three years and its 11 per cent lead
over BBC1'.
ITV has commissioned 20 new drama projects for next year - 10 of them single
dramas which are pilots for possible new series.
The new series range from John Thaw as a London barrister in Kavanagh QC to
an adaption of Mary Wesley's book The Vacillations of Poppy Carew.
The Network Centre has established a rolling three-year budget, enabling it
to enter exclusive long-term deals with Hollywood studios.
Mr Plantin claimed that the loss of Premier League football to British Sky
Broadcasting, the satellite television network in which Pearson, owner of
the Financial Times, has a stake, was a blessing in disguise as it enabled
the network to spend more on drama, entertainment and factual programmes.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Livestock shipping ban 'may cost farmers Pounds 200m'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British farmers yesterday claimed that they stood to lose up to Pounds 200m
a year in trade from bans on the export of live animals to the Continent
imposed by most large ferry companies.
The warning from the Association of Livestock Exporters came on the eve of
today's start of the ban by P&amp;O.
It also became clear yesterday that a new service for transporting live
animals was unlikely to be able to start immediately. MDT Holdings, a
London-based shipping company, plans to start a service from Harwich to get
around the ban on live exports.
However, the agriculture ministry said yesterday that the company's vessel
had not yet been approved and was unlikely to get the go-ahead to begin
today.
P&amp;O introduced its ban because it was unconvinced by tough measures
introduced by Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, to improve the
treatment of live animals on long journeys. 'We are looking to Brussels for
some action,' it said.
The ban in effect cuts off business for farmers, as the company carried 60
per cent of live exports. Stena Sealink and Brittany Ferries, with 10 per
cent of the market each, have already introduced bans - although Brittany's
ban covers only animals destined for immediate slaughter.
Livestock markets are already feeling the effects. The Meat and Livestock
Commission, the industry's marketing body, reports prices for Friesian bull
calves down 30 per cent this week to Pounds 99 against the same week last
year.
Prices have dropped sharply from Pounds 170 per animal at the end of June.
This can be explained partly by a seasonal increase in cattle coming to
market, but much of the drop is attributed to uncertainty over the ban.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Call to retain US defence trade link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK should look to the US as well as Europe when considering developing
new weapons systems, Mr Roger Freeman, defence procurement minister, said
yesterday on his return from Washington.
Mr Freeman said Britain should not move into an exclusively European defence
industry but should co-operate with the US on programmes such as
anti-ballistic missile systems. 'Whilst we have collaborations with France
and Germany we should not be party to any lockout of the Americans.'
He pointed out the imbalance in defence equipment trade between the US and
the UK. 'Currently we buy about Dollars 2bn of equipment from the US
annually, but they only buy about Dollars 1bn of equipment from us,' he
said. 'We need to have a more level playing field.'
In Washington Mr Freeman met Mr John Deutch, deputy US defence secretary, as
well as congressional leaders. Mr Freeman told Mr Deutch that the UK was
considering placing several large equipment orders in the US, including
replacement Hercules aircraft and attack helicopters for the Army. The
orders are worth a total of more than Pounds 3bn.
He called on the US to be equally open in its procurement policies. He
particularly mentioned the UK-Italian EH101 large helicopter as a possible
alternative to Boeing's V-22 Osprey, which is under threat of cancellation.
Mr Freeman told congressional leaders that protectionist policies in defence
increased the cost of equipment to the US taxpayer. But he acknowledged that
in times of heavy cutbacks, the pressure to buy locally was very strong.
He highlighted areas where the UK could co-operate with the US in weapons
development. He said that British expertise in surveillance, tracking and
radar, for example, could have application in ballistic missile defences.
Mr Freeman's emphasis on transatlantic links may disturb some European
business leaders who see the development of a pan-European industry as the
only way to prevent US domination of the international defence market.
Mr Louis Gallois, chief executive of the French state-owned Aerospatiale,
argued earlier this year that the European aerospace industry had to
consolidate quickly to meet the US challenge.
Many British defence executives also believe that while there may be
collaboration with the US on specific programmes, the bulk of the
co-operation and mergers will be within Europe, rather than as
Anglo-American deals.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Abracadabra] It's the barter magicians: Motoko Rich talks to
the people who can turn a photocopier into a delivery van
</HEADLINE>

Mr Edward Kalfayam, owner and managing director of Digital Print
Technologies, a commercial printer, has performed an act of financial
sorcery. 'I am spending Pounds 20,000 that I don't have this year,' he said.
In deals with a computer company and a laminating-machine maker, Mr Kalfayam
acquired Pounds 20,000 worth of hardware by bartering his company's printing
services.
This kind of reciprocal arrangement is more familiar to factory managers in
the former Soviet Union, where struggling economies have resorted to barter
as a form of payment.
But for Mr Kalfayam, whose business has a turnover of just under Pounds 1m a
year, the trade of services for goods rather than cash is a positive move
which has bolstered his company accounts.
Now he has an opportunity to increase his bartering power and move beyond
one-to-one trades. As a member of London-based Capital Barter Corporation, a
company which orchestrates third-party deals, he has entered a pool of
businesses which offer their goods and services for trade credits rather
than cash. Since last year Digital Print has used trade credits to purchase
legal services, couriers, air-conditioning and floor coverings.
CBC is one of a handful of barter companies in Britain's fledgling industry,
which includes The Bartering Company and Business Barter Exchange - both in
London - and Eurotrade in Newcastle upon Tyne.
The UK's systems are modelled on a flourishing industry in the US, where the
Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.4bn) barter business has been running for more than 30
years. There, large companies such as Lufthansa, the German national
airline; Playtex Family Products, which makes healthcare products, and USA
Network, a cable television company, use barter schemes for sophisticated
deals of about Dollars 2m or more.
CBC, which began trading last year, conducts comparatively modest deals,
ranging anywhere between Pounds 15 for a restaurant meal to Pounds 15,000
for a stock of computers. It acts as bookkeeper for its network of 150
members - which is growing at a rate of 10 a month - including big
corporations such as Konica Business Machines and Olympus Optical Company,
and small businesses such as Digital Print, and Mandeer, an Indian
restaurant in London.
The barter company debits and credits its members' accounts in 'trade
pounds'. These credits are equivalent to sterling, with items priced at
retail or wholesale value, depending on the nature of the business. Each
member is assigned a credit limit depending on the size of the company and
the desirability of its products. Within the pool the most popular items are
computers, photocopiers and airline tickets.
In the US, selling unsold inventories is an important function of the larger
barter companies. 'With the proliferation of bells and whistles on new
products, older products go obsolete very quickly,' said Mr Alan Elkin,
chief executive of Active International, one of the largest US barter
companies.
The company does Dollars 500m in trade annually. Mr Elkin said: 'We allow
manufacturers to trade for a wanted asset rather than cash, and they can
liquidate their merchandise for the full value that it is worth.'
But barter can never be the main form of sales for a company's product. 'It
is not going to save a failing firm that cannot make enough sales on a cash
basis,' said Mr Paul Suplizio, chief executive of the International
Reciprocal Trade Association. 'But it can provide a margin of additional
value.'
This value is best achieved in sectors where the incremental cost of taking
on extra clients is low. Printers, hotels, advertising agencies and many
manufacturers fall into this category.
'Allowing one room to be let on barter, for example, only costs a hotel the
price of laundry and cleaning because all the other services in the hotel
are fixed costs paid for by cash clients,' said Mr John McLennan, CBC
operations director. 'But the buying power it earns in trade pounds is equal
to the full retail value of the room.'
Some companies are reluctant to deal in barter because they believe they
still get better deals in cash. 'A lot of companies, when they find out how
much a fax machine is in trade pounds, say they can get a better deal by
getting a discount in cash,' said Mr John Howard, marketing manager at
Konica Business Machines, which has traded about Pounds 80,000 worth of
photocopiers and fax machines for carpeting and delivery vans. 'But if they
think how much it would cost to generate that cash, they would find it is
cheaper to do the deal on barter.'

FT  01 OCT 94 / Watchdog claims record savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Audit Office, the public-spending watchdog, yesterday claimed
to have prevented the Department of Employment and the Welsh Office from
wasting millions of pounds in recent years.
In its annual report the office said it had achieved record savings of
public money last year - in excess of Pounds 266m.
Amid growing concern about accountability and efficiency in Whitehall, Sir
John Bourn, comptroller and auditor-general, stressed there would be no
let-up in the number of scrutinies carried out by his organisation.
The report says that in 1991-92, the Employment Service, an executive
agency, made Pounds 30m of overpayments in unemployment benefit. As a result
of the watchdog's findings, the discrepancy had been reduced to Pounds 9.6m
by 1992-93.
It also claims to have discovered a discrepancy in the 1992-93 Welsh Office
accounts which showed it had erroneously paid Pounds 963,000 of community
charge grant to four local authorities. The Welsh Office has since recovered
this money.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Privatised IBA sets up telecoms rival to BT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Competition in the hotly contested long-distance telecommunications market
intensified yesterday with the launch of a new network by NTL, the
privatised transmission arm of the former Independent Broadcasting
Authority.
NTL said it would undercut existing operators British Telecommunications and
Mercury by about 20 per cent.
In effect NTL will provide wholesale trunk capacity for existing telecoms
operators or large corporate customers. Its network, comprising microwave
radio links between all the main population centres, is the second to be
launched this week following the start of service by Energis, the telecoms
arm of the National Grid.
Since NTL was privatised in 1991 in a Pounds 70m deal, Mr John Forrest, then
chief executive and now deputy chairman, has made it clear he wanted to
expand beyond providing broadcast transmission services and into more
broadly based telecommunications.
NTL's national telecoms launch follows deals with Vodafone, the UK's largest
cellular operator, and Birmingham Cable, a cable TV and telecoms operator,
which are using NTL to carry part of their long-distance traffic.
Cable companies, which are laying local television and telecoms networks but
lack national telecoms links, are NTL's most likely customers. They are keen
to force down long-distance carriage rates, and have avoided signing
long-term deals with BT or Mercury which would restrict their capacity to
move business to lower-cost suppliers.
NTL has been developing into a broadly based communications technology and
service group. Earlier this year it paid Pounds 6.6m for DTELS, an
organisation which specialises in mobile communications for emergency
services.
The group has also been gaining increasing recognition for its work on
digital compression, which allows between eight and 10 channels of
television to be squeezed into the capacity normally occupied by one.
The group, based at the former IBA research headquarters near Winchester,
has a development deal with Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Pace,
the consumer electronics group.
NTL's digital compression technology is likely to be used as part of plans
to launch satellite television systems next year in Asia and Europe.
NTL, which was bought by Mercury Asset Management, the fund-management arm
of SG Warburg, is expected to float eventually on the London Stock Exchange,
although no date has yet been set.
NTL claimed that its network - which can be used for voice, data and video
links - is the first in the UK to use leading-edge digital transmission
technology.
Mr John Okas, NTL's telecoms division director, said: 'This is part of our
strategic development into UK telecoms.'

FT  01 OCT 94 / Updating the 'polluter pays' policy: David Lascelles
analyses a report suggesting a fresh approach to easing traffic pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The environmental impact of Britain's traffic has reached unacceptable
levels and action is needed by the government to bring it under control, a
recent pollution report says.
But Sir John Houghton, chairman of the Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution, said the aim of its report was 'not to clobber the car' or limit
freedom of choice when it came to travelling. 'We'd like to see the benefits
of the car realised, but with environmental factors more fully taken into
account,' he said.
This will provide some comfort to the government, which expects the
commission's report to provoke strong criticism of its laissez faire
transport policy and reluctance to take firm measures to deal with traffic.
The 300-page report, to be published at the end of the month, is the result
of nearly two years' work by the 16-member commission, which consists of
scientists and other environmental experts. It will be making more than 100
recommendations on how to deal with Britain's transport problems.
The overall thrust of its recommendations should reinforce the government's
commitment to push up the price of petrol and curb the harmful gases spewed
out by more than 20m road vehicles.
The report's starting point is the government's forecast that the number of
vehicles on Britain's roads will double by the early part of the next
century. The quantified costs of transport pollution already amount to
between Pounds 10bn and Pounds 20bn a year, including Pounds 6bn for
accidents.
Although the government has a policy of making the polluter pay, the
commission has concluded that simple application of this principle to
transport will not work. For example, jacking up the price of petrol to a
level matching the environmental damage caused by traffic would also
severely damage the economy and disadvantage large numbers of Britons such
as rural dwellers.
'It has got to be done more intelligently than that,' said Sir John.
Instead, the commission will urge the government to set targets for reducing
accidents, air pollution and noise.
The report also reviews a wide range of fiscal, technical and regulatory
measures that might be used to achieve them.
Sir John declined to describe the recommendations in detail ahead of
publication, but it appears that the report will put forward a package of
options for dealing with traffic over the long term.
Some will increase the cost of driving, others will aim to raise technical
standards of vehicles, and others will put the case for expansion of public
transport.
There will be a strong emphasis on tax measures, with a doubling of the
petrol price over 10 years singled out as a desirable aim.
But the commission is also keen to raise the efficiency of the transport
sector, and its recommendations will go into the area of traffic management,
industrial planning and even home working to find ways of bringing down the
number of journeys people and businesses have to make.
'Environmental factors need to be much more seriously considered,' says Sir
John. 'People are having to accept transport impinging on their lives in a
way they don't like, through air pollution, noise and vibration, and land
use.'
To reach their recommendations, members of the commission travelled widely
abroad - to the US, the Continent and Japan. But Sir John said that no
country had found the perfect answer.
The US approach was heavy-handed, making excessive use of regulation. Japan
had curbed pollution and had a good train system, but its road network was
poor. One of the strongest impressions members brought back was of Delft in
Holland where 40 per cent of journeys are made by bicycle, even in the rain.
Although the commission's report is being awaited with some anxiety by the
transport industry, Sir John said he doubted that it would reduce the amount
of traffic on the roads; at best it would only slow down its growth.
'It would be unrealistic to expect any measures to reverse the rate of
growth,' he said. However he said the commission was looking for ways to
have 'a substantial impact' on the pace at which Britain's traffic was
increasing.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Clothing industry in US barter deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The seasons, fickle consumers and changing fashions can all leave clothing
manufacturers and retailers with unsold stock, Motoko Rich writes.
Traditionally, excess stock is discounted heavily or sold to liquidators for
as low as 15 per cent of wholesale value.
But yesterday, Apparel Marketing Services, the trading subsidiary of the
British Knitting and Clothing Export Council, signed an agreement with
Atwood Richards, a US corporate barter company, to offer the council's 1,200
members an opportunity to dispose of assets for better value.
Atwood Richards, a private company, has been operating since 1958. It trades
in 28 countries and opened its UK office in London last year.
'Where companies can no longer realise the cash or are facing a loss, we
will buy their stock at close to wholesale value and exchange it for
essential, pre-budgeted goods and services,' said Mr Trevor Edwards,
managing director of Atwood Richards in London.
The company acts as a principal - as opposed to a broker - and buys products
with trade credits, which are redeemable for specified goods and services.
These are obtained when Atwood sells a client's excess products, usually
outside its cash market.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Livestock shipping ban 'may cost farmers Pounds 200m'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British farmers stand to lose up to Pounds 200m a year in trade from bans on
the export of live animals to the Continent imposed by ferry companies.
The figure was given yesterday by the Association of Livestock Exporters one
the eve of today's start of the ban by P&amp;O.
There was more bad news for farmers yesterday as it became clear that a new
service for transporting live animals was unlikely to be able to start
immediately. MDT Holdings, a London-based shipping company, plans to unveil
a service from Harwich to get around the ban on live exports which has now
been imposed by most large ferry companies.
However, the agriculture ministry said yesterday that the company's vessel
had not yet been approved by its inspectors and was unlikely to receive the
go-ahead for a service to begin today. 'The company hasn't submitted any
formal papers for export yet,' the ministry said.
P&amp;O introduced its ban because it was unconvinced by tough measures
introduced by Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, to improve the
treatment of live animals on long journeys. 'We are looking to Brussels for
some action - there needs to be European-Union-wide enforcement of the
measures,' it said.
The ban in effect cuts off business for UK farmers, as the company carried
60 per cent of live exports. Stena Sealink and Brittany Ferries, with 10 per
cent of the market each, have already introduced bans - although Brittany's
ban covers only animals destined for immediate slaughter.
Livestock markets are already feeling the effects of the ban. The Meat and
Livestock Commission, the industry's marketing body, reports prices for
Friesian bull calves down 30 per cent this week to Pounds 99 a head against
the same week last year.
Prices have dropped sharply in recent months from Pounds 170 per animal at
the end of June. This can be explained partly by a seasonal increase in
cattle coming to market, but much of the drop in the market is attributed to
uncertainty among farmers over the ferry ban.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Singh predicts growth of 7% through the 1990s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India's economy has overcome the crisis of 1991 and can look forward to
sustainable growth of 6 to 7 per cent in the second half of the 1990s, Mr
Manmohan Singh, finance minister, said in London yesterday.
'We have been essentially in the business of crisis management. This year
that phase is broadly over,' he said.
Mr Singh, in Europe for the annual meetings of the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank, was at pains to rebut charges that the pace of economic
reform was slowing. Except for a setback in curbing the fiscal deficit,
reform had gone 'broadly at the pace that we said we would go.'
For example central government would continue with its privatisation effort.
The so-called Rangarajan report of a committee set up by the government and
the Reserve Bank had recommended central government should reduce its stake
in public sector companies to as low as 26 per cent in some cases. Current
rules call on the government to maintain a 49 per cent stake in companies
which are privatised.
Mr Singh said this report had not yet been discussed by the cabinet, but he
sympathised with its conclusions. 'We need a bolder programme of
disinvestment in order to reduce the burden of interest charges.'
India also expected to introduce legislation on trade union reform within
two years and make the rupee convertible on the capital account by 1996 or
1997.
It would stand by its plans to remove quantitative restrictions on imports
of consumer goods within the next three years.
Such protection encourages excess domestic production of consumer goods as
opposed to investment goods and diverts foreign investment to the wrong
sectors, he said.
Mr Singh acknowledged that his medium term expectations were for a growth
rate no higher than India achieved in the 1980s and lower than that
anticipated for China. But he said India's earlier growth had been
unsustainable because it depended too heavily on borrowing.
As for China, its economic statistics needed greater scrutiny. There was a
possibility that they overstated growth while China could manage with a
higher rate of inflation than India.
This year the Indian economy should grow at more than 5 per cent. The
inflation rate should fall back to about 7 per cent from more than 8 per
cent at present. Though export growth had slowed, the current account
deficit would remain small and the budget deficit should be held to 6 per
cent of gross domestic product.
India's exports in August were Dollars 2.11bn, some 24.6 per cent higher
than the same month last year. This followed four months of sluggish
performance which gave rise to concern about future prospects.
Figures published yesterday by the commerce ministry showed exports in the
five months to August were 10.6 per cent up, compared with 8.3 per cent for
the four months to July. But the growth rate is still below the annual
target of 15 per cent or more.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Pachinko gamesters defy tax bait
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and KUNIKO KURIMURA
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's national police force has lost a campaign to tempt more operators of
the country's pachinko game industry to accept the virtues of paying tax.
The National Police Agency reports it is making little headway with its
tactic of introducing tax-assessable pre-paid game cards, an attempt to
persuade pachinko parlour owners to divulge earnings.
The government's recent tax reform, partly intended to bolster the tax base,
is therefore likely to leave untouched a rich source of revenue.
Pachinko, an addiction for a quarter of Japan's population, is a
recession-proof mixture of pinball and gambling. It has an estimated annual
turnover of Y17,500bn (Pounds 113.6bn). Players buy handfuls of
ball-bearings, fed into pinball machines and spat out again in greater or
lesser amounts, regulated by computer.
Metal balls are exchanged for prizes or sold for cash, contrary to a
Japanese law against gambling for money. The balls are sold at neighbouring
shops, whose ownership is tied to the pachinko parlours.
The parlours are often owned by North Korean immigrants, who send a
popularly estimated Y60bn-Y80bn a year back to relatives in Pyongyang.
Failure to crack the problem has not only cost the government tax revenue,
it has also caused diplomatic embarrassment over this unintended subsidy to
an unfriendly regime.
Japan's police force chose a tactful line. Taking a heavy hand to pachinko
would have invited the anger of the gangsters who protect this and other
fringe industries. As has been shown in recent weeks some of these gangsters
have alarmingly light trigger fingers.
At the turn of the decade the police agency informally promoted the
development of two producers of pre-paid pachinko cards and vending
machines, Nihon Leisure Card and and Nihon Game Card, both chaired by former
police officers.
The aim was to enable tax authorities to guess individual pachinko
operators' sales and income by the number of pre-paid cards they purchased,
according to a report in the latest issue of the weekly magazine, Aera.
Since starting business in 1990, the two groups have installed systems in
just over 3,000 out of Japan's 18,000 pachinko parlours, making a tidy
profit. Police gave new pachinko owners operating licenses in half the usual
time, in return for a promise to install a card system, according to Aera.
Existing operators, showing deference to the police, bought systems in the
interests of 'modernisation'.
The hitch was that parlours continued to sell balls for cash, alongside
pre-paid cards.
In despair, the police agency asked the finance ministry to offer tax
reductions to pachinko parlours that were prepared to come clean and use
pre-paid cards exclusively. The ministry, which has never shared the
national fondness for a flutter in the pachinko arcade, refused.
It goes to show that removing some of the constraints on the Japanese
economy can be longer and trickier than it might at first appear.

</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has
papered over an increasingly serious rift between its European and
non-European members by naming the ambassador of Sweden as its acting head
for the next two months.
After spending most of the past three days vainly trying to resolve the
deadlock between rival French and Canadian candidates, the envoys of the
25-nation organisation yesterday called on the services of one of their
number, Mr Staffan Sohlman of Sweden.
He will act as secretary general until November 30, if before then they
remain unable to agree a successor to Mr Jean-Claude Paye, whose term ended
at midnight on Thursday.
The sucession crisis therefore continues in this staid governmental
think-tank, whose solid economic output generates interest but never drama
and which takes decisions by consensus.
The two main candidates - Mr Paye, the Frenchman who has served as secretary
general for the past 10 years, and Mr Donald Johnston, a former Canadian
minister - would appear to have virtually knocked each other out. Equally,
however, it might prove hard for either to leave the field, given the
strength of governmental feeling now ranged behind them.
The French foreign ministry indicated last night that Mr Paye was still a
candidate, drawing hope from what it called 'an indicative vote' in the OECD
council that was said to have given the Frenchman twice as many votes as the
Canadian.
The split was along geographical lines, with most European envoys speaking
up for Mr Paye and non-Europeans for Mr Johnston.
But the US, which effectively leads the Johnston camp, said last night it
stuck to its position that 10 years was enough for Mr Paye, and that the
time had come for a non-European to lead the organisation. An ambassador
representing a government in the Johnston camp admitted last night that 'the
French have pulled out all the stops' for Mr Paye, but said it was nonsense
for the French to characterise soundings in the Council as anything
resembling a vote which was impossible under OECD rules.
The prospect of contined deadlock marginally increases the chances of the
third declared candidate, Lord Lawson, the former UK chancellor of the
exchequer, who has offered himself as a compromise candidate.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Liu spells out reform programme

<TEXT>
China plans to accelerate economic reform with the aim of establishing a
'socialist market economy' by the end of the century, Mr Liu Zhongli,
Chinese finance minister, said in Madrid yesterday.
Mr Liu told an International Monetary Fund and World Bank conference, that
the Beijing government's priorities were to establish modern enterprise
systems and speed the reform of macro-economic management 'in fiscal,
taxation, financial and investment areas'.
He said China would establish a legal framework for a modern market economy
to govern and regulate the new corporate culture. China would also take
steps to control inflation and maintain stability.
Mr Liu pledged to step up China's exchanges with countries abroad. 'Opening
up to the outside world constitutes an integral component of our reform
programme,' he said.
Mr Liu acknowledged that China was still in transition from the old highly
centrally planned system, which was 'deficient in discipline and
risk-containing mechanisms', to one in which market mechanisms played the
dominant role in allocating resources.
'We envisage that by the end of the 1990s a socialist market economy will,
by and large, have been established, which will develop into a mature and
stable system in another 20 years or so.'
Mr Liu's comments marked the first time a senior Chinese official had
spelled out to an international audience China's plans to speed reform. They
were seen as likely to boost confidence among international investors who
last year poured more than Dollars 20bn (Pounds 12.6bn) in direct investment
into China, making it the largest single recipient of foreign direct
investment in the developing world.
Senior World Bank officials also gave China a vote of confidence yesterday
when they disclosed that the bank, which committed more than Dollars 3bn to
China in regular and concessional loans last year, could without difficulty
continue lending at this rate for five or 10 years.
Mr Nicholas Hope, director of the World Bank's China and Mongolia
department, said the bank had three priorities in China: to help implement
its reform programme; ease infrastructure bottlenecks, especially in the
power and transport areas; and to help in the plan to eliminate absolute
poverty, afflicting 80m people, by the year 2000.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Opposition snubs Japan's premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's new opposition group yesterday boycotted prime minister Tomiichi
Murayama's address to the opening session of parliament, the first such snub
in 28 years of Japanese politics.
Undeterred, Mr Murayama outlined his three-month-old government's policies
to his opponents' nearly empty benches, completing the political and tax
reforms which had been started by the opposition parties during their tenure
in power for nearly a year until June.
He aims, during the 65-day parliamentary session, to enact a bill to redraw
Japan's unique multi-seat constituency boundaries, replacing them with small
single seat boundaries, plus regional seats which will be chosen by
proportional representation.
This will be the final touch to the political and electoral reforms which
have dominated the government's time for much of the past year.
Also on the new government's agenda is the enactment of a recent package of
income tax cuts with a subsequent increase in consumption tax, civil service
spending cuts, and pensions reform.
Renovation, the newly formed voting bloc of nine opposition groups, gave as
its reason for boycotting Mr Murayama's speech the government's refusal to
select a member of the opposition as deputy speaker of the lower house.
Renovation also wanted an 80-day rather than 65-day parliamentary session.
Opposition officials promised to give the government a 'turbulent'
parliamentary session, starting with questions to the prime minister next
week. The government, however, with its 38-seat majority, appeared confident
of being able to hold power for its full term.
Mr Keizo Obuchi, vice president of the Liberal Democratic Party, the
dominant member of the ruling coalition, said yesterday that autumn 1997
would be the best time for the next general election.
The opposition, by contrast, wants an election soon after the new
constituency boundary bill is enacted.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Murayama urges action to reduce unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's prime minister, yesterday called for steps to
fight unemployment, which remained stuck at a seven-year high of 3 per cent
in August for the second month running.
He made his appeal at the first meeting of labour ministers since the
government took office in June.
The Economic Planning Agency said it would advance, by a month to early
October, details of a scheme to expand the government's Y430,000bn (Pounds
3.27bn) public works scheme, covering the decade to 2000.
The latest unemployment report suggests that the labour market will continue
to be weak through the early stages of Japan's economic recovery, warned
government officials.
The number of jobs available for every 100 job seekers rose slightly from 62
in July to 63 last month, but was still low for a country that agonised over
a labour shortage only five years ago.
Most economic analysts expect the jobless rate to go on rising gently into
the recovery, because the yen's strength continues to put pressure on
exporters to cut costs to bring them closer into line with international
competitors.
That conclusion was supported yesterday by a labour ministry survey of
manufacturers, in which more than 40 per cent of companies which were
shifting production overseas expected to cut Japanese staff as a result.
The risk of deflation still remains, according to another set of statistics
released yesterday, showing that consumer prices in Tokyo rose by a mere 0.1
per cent in the year to September. The trend is for prices to stagnate,
reckons the government's management and coordination agency.

FT  01 OCT 94 / China applauds the past as it looks to life without Deng:
Beijing celebrates 45 years of communism, while the health of its most
radical economic reformer is failing fast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China today celebrates the 45th anniversary of the Communist revolution in
the shadow of the deteriorating health of Mr Deng Xiaoping, the senior
leader, and burdened by worries over rising prices.
But the country's top officials are seeking to ensure these concerns do not
spoil the anniversary celebrations that are being conducted with an
intensity that seems out of proportion to the occasion.
Among planned displays are mass choral concerts in which thousands of voices
will be raised in patriotic songs of a bygone era. China's rulers, it seems,
are delving into the past to validate the present.
Preparations have been under way for months and were given a political focus
by this week's meeting of the 320-member Central Committee, which approved a
blueprint for revitalising party institutions.
The document, with the numbing title of 'The resolution on strengthening
grassroots party organisation', was hardly the most self-confident
declaration by the world's largest mass political organisation.
Its emphasis on bolstering party institutions in this uncertain transitional
phase from one generation of leaders to the next, revealed deep-seated
concerns about the future at a time when the communist party's prestige is
at a low ebb. But for today at least, China's leaders will be at pains to
deflect attention from the shortcomings of the ruling party and personal
hardship, to the mass celebrations in Beijing.
China's attention will focus, as it has so often in the past, on Tiananmen
Square, where 100,000 people from across the country will participate in
'flag waving' events to mark the anniversary.
Official propaganda has sought, in the build-up to national day, to remind
people of their increasing prosperity and to link this with Mr Deng's
legacy. A campaign to lionise China's ailing senior leader has moved into
higher gear.
In Beijing, a photographic exhibition of Mr Deng's life has been mounted at
the Museum of Revolutionary History on Tiananmen Square; laser discs of his
speeches are being marketed; and news commentaries have been trumpeting his
contribution to the revolution.
Praise for Mr Deng's theory of 'building socialism with Chinese
characteristics', a phrase that means almost anything goes, is the slogan of
the moment. Party documents make scant mention of ideology these days beyond
pro-forma references to the party's Marxist underpinnings.
Mr Deng's dire warnings that China would be 'ripped asunder' unless it
adhered to the 'four cardinal principles' now appear a faint echo of the
past. China, he had said, should resolutely adhere to the socialist road,
the people's democratic dictatorship, the leadership of the party, and
Marxism-Leninism Mao Zedong thought.
Emphasis given to Mr Deng's reformist role has fuelled speculation about his
possible early demise. Attempts to reinforce his legacy in the public mind
are seen as part of enhanced preparations for his death.
China's senior leader last appeared in public when he was shown on
television visiting Shanghai earlier this year. He was extremely frail, and
his health is said to be continuing to deteriorate. Unconfirmed reports
circulated in Beijing this month that he had been committed to hospital.
But while China might be exhibiting unease about its leadership transition
and difficulties managing its economic transformation, it is showing no such
diffidence in its foreign relations. Since the US renewed China's Most
Favoured Nation trading status in May, Beijing has gone on the offensive.
It has toughened its position in the row with Britain over Hong Kong, taken
Japan to task for the invitation extended to Taiwan's President Lee Teng-Hui
to attend this month's Asian games in Hiroshima, and sharply criticised the
US over its decision to make small changes in the way it deals with Taiwan.
A mood of self-congratulation was certainly reflected in a commentary
published this week by the official Xinhua news agency. 'China has made
brilliant achievements in diplomacy over the past 45 years,' it quoted a
vice foreign minister as saying.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Indian food exports hit by plague panic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW DELHI

<TEXT>
India's businessmen were yesterday counting the growing economic cost of the
plague, with tourism and food exports the two sectors hardest hit.
The disease, which has killed about 50 people and left 2,000 others sick,
has disrupted the travel trade and exports. Hotels and tour operators,
gearing up for the start of the tourist season, have reported cancellations
by groups from Europe, the Far East and North America. Some business
visitors have cancelled trips. At least three trade fairs have been
postponed.
Trade with the Gulf states, worth Dollars 3bn a year, has been badly hit by
the decision by Gulf governments to close air and sea links with India. The
biggest impact is on exporters of fresh food, who rely on the Gulf for 70
per cent of their overseas sales.
Food exporters are having to cancel purchases, put produce in store or try
to sell domestically. 'After three years of effort in promoting exports we
are back at square one,' said Mr Gian Nega, assistant director of the
Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority. Fresh
food exports to the Gulf last year totalled Dollars 177m.
Health officials, including Dr N K Shah, the resident representative of the
World Health Organisation, accused the Gulf countries and other states which
have cut trade links of over-reacting. The Indian government launched a
publicity campaign aimed at calming the fears of tourists, business
travellers and importers of Indian goods. Mr T Khanna, the commerce
secretary, expressed concern at the potential damage to Indian trade.
'There's been a panic reaction from some of our trading partners. But I
believe it will soon blow over.'
Speaking in London, Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, said the
countries which had imposed restrictions on travel and imports risked
hampering efforts to deal with the problem.
'We are trying to create an atmosphere where people have confidence that
plague is no longer an incurable disease,' he said. 'Creating an atmosphere
of panic which drives the whole thing underground would do a great
disservice to both India and the outside world,' he said.
An official of KLM, the Dutch airline, in Delhi said much harm had already
been done. 'The whole image of India has already been affected.' He
estimated 25-30 per cent of tourists who had planned to travel to India by
KLM this week and next had called off their trips. Other European airlines,
including British Airways, Lufthansa and Swissair, also reported
cancellations by tourist groups.
Yesterday's most serious development in the spread of the plague were the
deaths of an 18-year-old man and a five-year-old boy in Delhi. They were the
first deaths outside the western city of Surat and its neighbourhood, where
pneumonic plague erupted last week. The tally of suspected cases rose by
about 700 yesterday to 2,500, mainly in Surat and in remote eastern
Maharashtra, where bubonic plague broke out a month ago.
India's exports in August were Dollars 2.11bn, some 24.6 per cent higher
than the same month last year. This followed four months of sluggish
performance which gave rise to concern about future prospects. Figures
published yesterday by the commerce ministry showed exports in the five
months to August were 10.6 per cent up, compared with 8.3 per cent for the
four months to July. But the growth rate is still below the annual target of
15 per cent or more.

FT  01 OCT 94 / SPD guns for Kohl with 100-day plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's opposition Social Democrats yesterday launched their final assault
on Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling coalition, two weeks and two days before
election day, with the publication of a 100-day action programme to revive
the German economy.
It includes all the top priorities in the party's future government
programme, from job creation to equal rights for women, with a big tax
reform package intended to help the lower-paid.
There was no sign of controversial plans to introduce a national speed
limit, heartily disliked by the powerful motor industry. But, instead, it
does include an ingenious scheme to give the owners of ageing motor cars a
DM1,000 (Pounds 410) 'scrap bonus' if they swap them for a new model, to
revive vehicle production.
The party brought out its three biggest guns to bombard the government
yesterday with a plethora of proposals to boost demand, create new jobs, and
redistribute the soaring tax costs of German unification - all intended to
be under way within three months of taking office.
Mr Rudolf Scharping, the Social Democratic party (SPD) leader, flanked by Mr
Oskar Lafontaine, his deputy and finance spokesman, and Mr Gerhard Schroder,
his greatest rival and would-be economy minister, sought to galvanise a
wilting German electorate into the final straight, just as the latest
opinion polls begin to show signs that the SPD is starting to close the gap
on Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union.
The 100-day programme would be launched by a round table of trade unions,
employers, and the German Bundesbank, to design a new job creation strategy
as soon as the election is over, the SPD leader said. Over four years, he
believes 2m jobs could be created with a DM20bn programme, and 700,000 more
in new environmental schemes.
As for the party's tax plans, they would mean real reductions for 80 per
cent of the tax-paying population, at the expense of the highest income
earners, he said. And families will get a big increase in monthly cash
payments for each child, to replace the present system of tax allowances.
'Everything we want to do in the first 100 days is intended to stabilise the
economy,' Mr Scharping declared.
The plans to boost car sales bear the inventive stamp of Mr Schroder, the
prime minister of Lower Saxony and supervisory board member of Volkswagen,
who was Mr Scharping's great rival for the party leadership.
Not only is it intended to give a lift to the ailing motor industry. The
'scrap bonus' plan, first floated by Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW's chief
executive, would appear to turn the old voters' adage on its head: far from
worrying whether they should buy a used car from Messrs Scharping, Schroder
and Lafontaine, they are simply being asked to sell them.

Unemployment in France rose 15,200 to 3.34m in August, offsetting the
improvement of the previous two months, according to statistics published by
the labour ministry. Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister, described the
increase, which left the overall unemployment rate at 12.6 per cent, as a
'hitch along the way'. He said that the reduction in unemployment ahead of
presidential elections next spring, was an uneven process. The centre-right
government of prime minister Edouard Balladur is counting on such a
reduction. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said this week that
between 260,000 and 300,000 jobs would be created in 1995.

General Motors and the United Auto Workers union said they had reached
tentative agreement over a dispute which threatened to halt much of the
company's North American production. The dispute, over GM's reluctance to
hire more permanent workers as its output has risen in recent months, had
led to a walk-out at a parts plant in Flint, Michigan, on Tuesday. This in
turn forced a halt at a number of the company's production lines, affecting
22,300 workers in all. UAW members will vote on it today. GM has been trying
to hold down its workforce to become more competitive with its main US
rivals and to prepare it for any future downturn in the vehicle market.

<TEXT>
Mr Vitaly Masol, Ukrainian prime minister, cast a shadow over Ukraine's
commitment to radical reform only hours after the International Monetary
Fund agreed to provide economic aid this year. The prime minister, a former
communist who favours gradual reforms but was persuaded by President Leonid
Kuchma to sign the IMF deal, said on Thursday night the IMF programme
'contains issues parliament must resolve'. Although the government is
formally committed to reform, he said, 'there are questions in the document
still to be decided.' The success of Ukrainian reform depends on Mr Kuchma's
ability to overcome opposition from farming and industrial lobbies well
represented in parliament and the cabinet of ministers, which Mr Masol
heads.

The break-away Caucasian republic of Chechnya accused Russia of open
aggression against a sovereign state as unidentified helicopters attacked
the airport in Grozny yesterday morning inflicting several casualties.
Chechen officials threatened to wage a terrorist war against Russian cities
unless the provovation ceased, local newsagencies said. Chechen opposition
forces, which have been overtly backed by Moscow, were also reported to have
issued an ultimatum that they would storm the capital unless Mr Dzhokhar
Dudayev stood down as president yesterday. But in an interview with the
Itar-Tass newsagency, Mr Dudayev denied he had received any ultimatum and
Grozny was reported to be calm yesterday afternoon.

The EU and US opponents to the Uruguay Round deal suffered a setback when
the US yesterday said it had won an important case before a panel of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The panel found against the European
petitioners that key provisions of US laws regulating car fuel economy and
luxury taxes are consistent with international trade rules. Mr Mickey
Kantor, the US trade representative, said the report would 'help steer the
debate' over trade and environmental issues under the new World Trade
Organisation.
The US Senate leadership and maverick Senator Ernest Hollings have reached
agreement to hold a vote on the implementing legislation for the Uruguay
Round on December 1. The bill, originally scheduled for a vote next week,
has been delayed by Mr Hollings, who wants a national debate on the issue.
'I'm trying my best not to alienate my colleagues,' he said.

<TEXT>
Personal income in the US rose 0.4 per cent in August, the seventh straight
monthly increase, but failed to keep pace with a 0.9 per cent jump in
spending, the government said yesterday. The spending increase was the
largest since it rose by 1.3 per cent in February. The Commerce Department
also reported that disposable income - income after taxes - rose 0.5 per
cent in August. Financial markets were mixed on the news. Treasury bond
prices fell slightly, and the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 6 points,
later ending the day 11.44 down at 3,843.19. The spending increase was
greater than many analysts expected. During July, personal income increased
0.5 per cent, while spending rose 0.3 per cent. Income last fell in January,
when it slipped 0.6 per cent. Consumer spending, which accounts for
two-thirds of the nation's gross domestic product, was up for the fourth
straight month and six of the last seven. The combination of incomes and
spending meant that Americans' savings rate - savings as a percentage of
disposable income  - was 3.8 per cent in August, compared to a revised 4.2
per cent the previous month. The Commerce Department previously pegged the
savings rate at 4.1 per cent for July.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Boost for IMF members sought: UK-US proposal to increase
international liquidity with SDR issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, and Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury
secretary, will this weekend press the decision making body of the
International Monetary Fund to agree to a UK-US plan that would allow the
Fund to boost the monetary reserves of its member countries.
The IMF's policy making Interim Committee will tomorrow consider
British-American proposals to issue between 12bn and 16bn of the Fund's own
reserve asset, the special drawing right, and so boost international
liquidity by between Dollars 17.6bn (Pounds 11bn) and Dollars 23.5bn.
Although the plan would supply reserves to all IMF members, it has been
structured to confer special benefits on Russia and other former communist
countries which have joined the IMF since the last issue of SDRs in 1981, as
well as poor developing nations. In this way, London and Washington hope to
overcome German opposition to the idea of a general increase in SDRs and so
solve a problem that has been dogging international financial diplomacy for
several years.
The Interim Committee meeting could see some tough bargaining, however, with
Germany expected to argue that any SDR allocation should only benefit the
recently joined IMF members. Yesterday, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank
president, said there were 'good reasons for being in favour' of a special
allocation for new members.
The UK-US proposals form part of a package of measures to increase the
capacity of the IMF to provide financial support for countries in economic
difficulty.
The Interim Committee will also consider an increase in the annual access
limits of IMF members to fund resources to 90 per cent from 68 per cent of
their IMF quotas, or membership subscriptions, for three years. Also on the
agenda is a plan to increase the use that former communist countries can
make of the Fund's temporary special 'systemic transformation facility' that
was set up to help Russia and other ex-communist states develop market-based
economies.
The US-UK plan for the SDR allocation consists of an 'equity' part to
correct the injustice suffered by the 37 countries with no SDRs and a
so-called 'pro-rata' allocation to the entire membership.
The plan will require a change in the IMF articles, necessitating the
backing of members with 85 per cent of total quotas and parliamentary
ratification in most countries. Ironically, these formidable hurdles give
the plan some chance of success because Germany insists it will only support
a SDR issue if it is clear that it is a special one-off event.
The Germans - backed by the US and Britain - have vigorously opposed
proposals from Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, for a general
issue of SDR36bn to all Fund members. These countries argue that Mr
Camdessus's proposals, which would need just 85 per cent support in the IMF
board, are unjustified because there is no global need for new liquidity.
The pro-rata part of the UK-US plan is structured to allocate SDRs in two
ways. Countries would either receive SDRs expressed as a percentage of quota
(20, 24 or 29 per cent are under discussion) or a percentage increase
(possibly 8 per cent) in their existing SDR reserves.
British officials claim that this would give the low-income developing
countries and former communist states more SDRs than under Mr Camdessus's
proposals.
They said that under the UK-US plan, Russia and other former Soviet
republics could expect to get SDR1.6bn while low- and middle-income
developing countries would receive SDR4.8bn. Mr Camdessus's plan would
channel SDR11bn to the 11 richest industrial countries.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Cardoso looks to help of 'sovereign ruler': ACM, the
Brazilian politician who can deliver millions of votes for president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The letters ACM stretch across Brazil's north-eastern state of Bahia,
visible on posters along each roadside and in every dusty village. They are
the initials of Mr Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, one of the country's most
influential politicians, whom enemies call the 'sovereign ruler' of Bahia.
ACM is also one of the reasons Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former
finance minister, is likely to win Brazil's presidential election on Monday.
An alliance with ACM has delivered Mr Cardoso several million votes in poor
northern states, such as Bahia, where he was unknown.
'I had the courage to support Fernando Henrique when he had only 10 per cent
in the polls. I don't have the vanity to say it was our support which will
win him the election, it was also the Real plan,' says Mr Magalhaes in an
interview, referring to Brazil's new Real currency, which has sharply
reduced inflation.
Mr Magalhaes is an old-style, populist leader who has spent 40 of his 67
years in politics. He has been governor of Bahia three times and confidant
of several Brazilian presidents, of the left and right. His influence in
Bahia is so great that local politicians are known either as supporters
called 'carlistas' - because of his middle name - or 'anti-carlistas'.
He has grown rich from politics but has maintained his popular touch, often
wearing T-shirts with red, white and blue stripes - the colours of the flag
of Bahia. And he knows the proper greetings and dances for Bahia's candomble
religion, developed by immigrant African slaves, even though he is a
Catholic.
'My power stems from my people because they know that I work for them,' he
says. 'When I pass by, people want to hug me and kiss me. You won't see any
other politician like that.' Once again, Mr Magalhaes is seeking public
office. This time, he is standing for the senate and he has 60 per cent
support in the polls.
Mr Magalhaes' opponents, however, say he has been in power too long. They
point out that he nominated more than half the state's judges during his
terms as governor. In the state's legislative assembly, 42 of the 63 members
support him. In the federal legislature, 20 of Bahia's 39 representatives
are members of the political party he controls, the Liberal Front (PFL).
Following a controversial decision while he was minister of communications,
he gained Bahia's five main broadcasting concessions for TV Globo, Brazil's
most popular station. He and allies are also alleged to control 56 radio
stations in the state. And opponents claim TV and radio are often used
against them. Says Mr Jaques Wagner of the left-wing Workers' party: 'If you
oppose him, you are dead politically.'
During elections, Mr Magalhaes' electoral maquina or machine is almost
unbeatable. His only serious defeat, in 1986, came after the opposing party
introduced another new currency, taking votes from him.
Mr Magalhaes' hold over Bahia is a situation common to many other states in
Brazil's north-east, the country's poorest and most depressed region, where
politics depends on patronage. The mayor of a small town lacks sufficient
resources to build schools or hospitals and thus needs the support of the
state's governor. In return the mayor is expected to use his influence to
deliver his town's votes.
At a weekend election rally in the town of Jequie in Bahia, the local mayor
spent about five minutes of his speech thanking 'ACM' for help with various
construction projects. He then told the several thousand people to vote for
Mr Cardoso as president, ACM for the senate and ACM's candidate for
governor, Mr Paulo Souto. ACM waved each time his name was mentioned.
The voting process is not always fair. Six Bahia districts were recently
found to have more registered voters than inhabitants. The ballot papers of
people who have moved away or died are held by local leaders. One common
practice is the 'ant vote', where voters copy the choices of the person in
front and pass them on to the person behind, rather like ants at work. In
return, they are paid a small sum of money, given food or sometimes
sterilised for free.
Not that such practices are uncommon in Brazil. Indeed, they are used freely
by Mr Magalhaes' opponents. What distinguishes Mr Magalhaes is that he is
better at using the system to retain power.
Under Brazil's election rules, each candidate is given free TV time every
night. But opponents often find their time reduced because Mr Magalhaes,
alleging he has been misrepresented in an earlier programme, is granted a
'right of reply' by election authorities.
Mr Jutahy Magalhaes, a candidate for governor and no relation, says his TV
programme has been interrupted 10 times but he has only won one right of
reply in return. 'ACM has the backing of the federal government, the state
government, the justice system and the election authorities. It's total
control,' he says.
ACM denies any influence over the justice or election authorities and says
he wins more rights of reply because his opponents 'lie and distort' the
truth.
He says he aims to fight for Bahia when he reaches the senate. But most
observers think he has wider horizons. With his power base he is likely to
be a key figure in Congress - especially since his son, Luis Eduardo
Magalhaes, is a front-runner to be elected president of the lower house.
Some observers think Mr Cardoso's very different background as a left-wing
academic will create problems between the two men. Some have suggested Mr
Cardoso will try to break with Mr Magalhaes once he is president. But
opponents of Mr Magalhaes in Bahia, several of whom used to be allies before
breaking ranks for personal or political reasons, caution that he is a
dangerous man to betray. 'Some of us still don't sleep well, even years
later,' according to one.

FT  01 OCT 94 / French ex-PM investigated over tainted blood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Former prime minister Laurent Fabius was yesterday placed under formal
investigation for being 'an accomplice to the poisoning' of more than 1,000
haemophiliacs who received transfusions of blood contaminated with the HIV
virus - believed to lead to Aids - up to mid-1985, when he was head of the
French government.
The long saga of France's HIV-blood case thus entered a new phase, as Mr
Fabius joined two of his former social affairs and health ministers - Mrs
Georgina Dufoix and Mr Edmond Herve - under investigation on the same charge
of conspiracy to poison.
Mr Fabius has denied knowing anything about the contaminated blood until the
summer of 1985, when he ordered compulsory testing of blood donors for HIV.
'I go into this investigation with much compassion for those who fell ill,
and their families, and strongly determined to establish the truth,' he said
yesterday.
The investigation by senior magistrates, expected to take up to a year,
could eventually lead to the three Socialist ex-ministers going on trial
before a special court of MPs, senators and judges.
In 1989, the French state conceded general responsibility to the
haemophiliacs, some 400 of whom have since died of their infection, by
deciding to give FFr100,000 (Pounds 12,000) compensation each to survivors.
This did not, however, lessen pressure for more specific action to be taken
against those running the health service and its blood bank.
Two years ago, two health officials were jailed for fraud for distributing
the tainted blood products. Out of this case came charges that the real
culprits were government ministers, who failed to heed the officials'
warnings, but who could not be tried under ordinary French law.
A move was made to impeach the ministers, but this procedure was held to be
too self-serving because it gave the parliament, then controlled by the
Socialists, the role of bringing charges as well as judging them.
Last year's constitutional reform gave the haemophiliacs' association the
right to take their complaints against ex-ministers directly to a panel of
senior magistrates, who will now undertake the investigation.
Mrs Dufoix has summed up the ex-ministers' attitude in proclaiming that she
is 'responsible (in a political sense) but not guilty (of any crime)'.
The investigation will centre on what the ex-ministers knew about the risk
of HIV contamination, when they first received this information, and what
they did to prevent the spread of infection. One of the more serious
allegations is that the government, or at least senior officials in it,
deliberately delayed approval for the distribution in France of a US HIV
test in order to protect the market for a similar French test then in
development.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Nato entry stalled for Visegrad countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK

<DATELINE>
   SEVILLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US, faced with strong Russian objections, has backed off from the idea
of putting four countries - Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia
 -on a fast track to full membership of Nato.
The new US position emerged yesterday at an informal meeting of Nato defence
ministers, where Germany's Mr Volker Ruhe received a cool response to his
proposal that the four central European states, the Visegrad group, should
be viewed as prime candidates for entry.
Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, said it would be 'entirely
premature' to set a timetable for the expansion of Nato. Asked to sum up the
discussion on new countries joining the alliance, Mr Perry said: 'We
certainly haven't specified who or when, and we are not likely to in the
near future.'
Mr Ruhe has argued that Russia can never join the alliance, and he wants the
16 existing members to agree as soon as possible on lists of nations which
definitely can, and definitely cannot, become full members.
However the US administration, which received President Boris Yeltsin in
Washington last week, has shied away from making rigid distinctions among
its former Warsaw Pact adversaries, and this reluctance appears to have
deepened in recent days.
After a two-day meeting in Seville that was overshadowed by the conflict in
the former Yugoslavia, Mr Perry disclosed that he was confident of more
Russian help in isolating the Bosnian Serbs, and in ensuring that the border
between Serbia and Bosnia was fully sealed.
He said that according to the 'incomplete' reports available to Washington,
Serbia had complied only partially with its obligation to sever military and
commercial links with its ethnic kinsmen in Bosnia. 'We look to Russia as
the government with the best communications with the Serbs, to assist in the
enforcement of this,' Mr Petry said.
While Mr Perry made no connection between the issues of Bosnia and Nato
enlargement, his comments on both matters suggested a greater US emphasis,
in the wake of last week's summit, on the idea of co-operation with Russia.
Mr Perry predicted that in future any Nato air strikes in Bosnia would be
carried out 'with greater speed, with surprise and with more force than in
the past'.
He acknowledged that Nato could not dictate to the UN grand commanders in
Bosnia when to invoke the air power of the alliance. But under new
procedures, he said, Nato pilots would have more freedom of action over
targets and timing once they had left the ground.

North Korea has made new proposals in talks with the US to resolve the

official said yesterday. Mr Ho Jong said his delegation had 'put on the
table very constructive and interesting ideas to quicken the solution of the
issues'. He refused to elaborate. Mr Robert Gallucci, the US chief
negotiator, flew back to Washington yesterday for consultations, but will be
returning to meet his North Korean opposite number, Mr Kang Sok-ju, next
Wednesday. In the meantime, technical discussions are continuing. Before
leaving, Mr Gallucci said there had been no substantial progress in the
previous week of talks but both sides wished to continue.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Fighting leaves three dead in Haiti
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fresh violence broke out in the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince yesterday as
a demonstration celebrating the expected return of Haiti's democratic
government degenerated into a pitched battle, leaving at least three people
dead and over a dozen injured.
The fighting, after a grenade attack that killed five people on Thursday,
marked a resurgence of clashes that threaten US efforts to restore democracy
to the Caribbean nation.
Yesterday's confrontation, erupted, when paramilitaries loyal to the
military regime attacked a crowd marching on the third anniversary of the
coup that toppled elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The incidents
throw into doubt the capacity of the US military, numbering 20,000 troops,
to guarantee civilians security for free political expression. They have
also increased pressure on the US to pursue a more forceful disarmament of
Haitian paramilitaries.
The demonstration followed mass at Port-au-Prince cathedral, where Father
Amos called for reconciliation between military loyalists and Aristide
supporters. The mass was attended by Mr Robert Malval, Mr Aristide's
nominated premier, who emerged from hiding to sit in the front pew, across
the aisle from Mr William Swing, US ambassador.
Last night Mr Aristide urged Haitians to halt the fighting. 'There should be
neither violence nor vengeance.' He was noncommital about when he would
return to Port-au-Prince, suggesting it could be 'before October 15' - the
date Haiti's military are due to step down.
The crowd had followed the official route for the demonstration past the
offices of Fraph, a militia faction loyal to the military government of
Lieutenant-General Raoul Cedras. Fraph paramilitaries were understood to
have thrown stones at and opened fire on the demonstrators, who took cover.
A suspected member of the paramilitary group was chased and beaten to death
by the crowd.
Observers say low-ranking officers of the police and army have relinquished
their responsibilities.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Yeltsin misses Irish talks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The steps leading to the Russian presidential aircraft were in place.
Dignitaries including the Irish prime minister Albert Reynolds were gathered
at Shannon airport to greet their guest - but president Boris Yeltsin failed
to appear for official talks.
After a 15-minute delay Mr Reynolds and his entourage returned to the
airport terminal accompanied by Oleg Soskovetz, first Russian deputy prime
minister, who stood in for Mr Yeltsin during the talks.
He said later Mr Yeltsin was 'extremely tired' after a 17-hour flight to
Ireland. On his return to Moscow, Mr Yeltsin told reporters he was feeling
'excellent' and had 'just overslept'.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Japan and US edge towards trade pact
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US and Japanese trade negotiators yesterday headed into a final day of talks
to open Japan's markets to US goods and services, having achieved 'big
progress' on government procurement.
A Japanese trade official in Washington said only one or two issues were
outstanding in the dispute over Japanese government purchases of
telecommunications and medical equipment. He said these could be settled
with the help of Mr Yohei Kono, Japan's foreign minister, who arrived in
Washington yesterday afternoon. Agreement was also near on US access to
Japan's insurance market.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, said: 'There is much yet to be
done.'
A Tokyo news report saying that the US and Japan had reached a deal on
procurement helped the dollar climb briefly above Y99 yesterday, but
official denials later wiped out some of the US currency's gains. It closed
in London at Y98.97, up from Thursday's close of Y98.505.
Rumours of a deal helped the London equity market, which closed 33.8 points
up at 3,026.3, also boosted by reports of a Pounds 100m buying programme
from an investment bank. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
closed 11.44 points lower at 3,843.19.
However, US and Japanese negotiators have been pessimistic about reaching a
deal on cars and car parts. If no vehicle deal is reached, the US is
expected to list car parts and flat glass as posing a barrier to US trade.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Tebbit and Bennites team up for 'best of Thatcher' video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There may be little love lost between the hard right and the hard left
inside parliament, but outside they are joining together in the mutual
pursuit of profit.
Lord Tebbit, former chairman of the Conservative party, who was once
described by Mr Michael Foot, former Labour leader, as 'a semi house-trained
polecat', has teamed up with an employee of Mr Tony Benn, the veteran
leftwinger, to make a video about Lady Thatcher.
Called No] No] No], the video went on sale earlier this week. It chronicles
Lady Thatcher's final year in the Commons and is directed by Ms Ruth
Winstone, long-time editor of Mr Benn's diaries. It is intended to 'make 'em
laugh and make 'em cry', with famous clips including Sir Geoffrey Howe's
resignation speech and Lady Thatcher's own defiant performance after the
vote of no confidence.
No] No] No] is the first video since the Commons lifted its ban earlier this
year on using its television footage for commercial purposes. A video of Mr
Benn's top 10 moments since the cameras were allowed in to parliament in
1989 was released last year as an experiment.
'After making 'the best of Benn', Wedgie's office thought 'this is a great
idea'. They realised that even hotter property than Tony is Mrs T,' Lord
Tebbit said. 'I was approached by these good leftwing socialists who had
seen a market opportunity. They asked me to act as raconteur, and as I'm a
great believer in encouraging capitalism, I said yes.'
He said the video had been made on an 'almost zero-budget', and noted that
they would not need to sell many copies, which retail at Pounds 9.99, to
make a profit.
If No] No] No] - likened by Lord Tebbit to the CD of Nat King Cole's 20
greatest hits - does well in the charts it will be followed by other
parliamentary releases. However, Lord Tebbit doubted whether any other MPs,
Lady Thatcher and Mr Benn aside, were colourful enough to merit a 'best of'
video, and said that future videos might concentrate on debates.
Mr Charles Frater, director of Parliamentary Films, which produced both the
Thatcher and Benn videos, said he had considered Mr Dennis Skinner,
outspoken Labour MP for Bolsover, as a subject. But he felt it would take
too long to watch the miles of available footage to find enough funny
moments for the video.
It is far from certain how large the market is for these videos, especially
for those on debates. Parliamentary Films has experimented with pilot films
on the election of the speaker of the House and the wild mammals protection
bill.
The company's optimism that these obscure titles would go down well in
schools has not been borne out.
'There was not much public enthusiasm for them,' said Mr Frater, a former
communist from South Africa who now describes himself as 'more left than
right'.
By contrast, 3,000 people had paid Pounds 12.99 for the Benn video, which he
said was 'not bad going'.

FT  01 OCT 94 / UN agency orders ferry probe: Estonia's bow doors may have
been torn off in storm, Swedish authorities say
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The International Maritime Organisation, the United Nations agency for
shipping, yesterday ordered a top-level inquiry into the safety of vehicle
ferries following the loss of more than 900 lives in the Estonia disaster.
The inquiry was announced as Sweden's National Maritime Board said the
Estonia may have sunk because its outer bow door was ripped off in a storm,
allowing water to pour on to the ship's cavernous vehicle deck.
It also emerged that the Europa, one of the ships that picked up survivors
of the Estonia tragedy, suffered serious damage to its bow door in the heavy
seas that lashed the rescue fleet.
As concern about the operation of roll-on roll-off ships grew, Mr William
O'Neil, the IMO secretary-general, ordered a full safety review by the
organisation's maritime safety committee.
IMO officials said the committee would consider all aspects of roll-on
roll-off shipping at its next meeting in December at the org-anisation's
London headquarters.
No agenda has yet been drawn up, but the committee is thought certain to
consider whether bulkheads on the ships' open vehicle decks would help to
increase stability in the event of a surge of water through the doors.
Most ship owners believe bulkheads would reduce the profitability of roll-on
roll-off ships. But an IMO official said the review's 'prime consideration'
would be safety. 'The travelling public are entitled to know that economic
considerations come second,' he said.
The committee has the power to amend the 1981 international convention on
the safety of life at sea, which provides the framework for national
shipping legislation in 122 countries covering 97 per cent of world tonnage.
However, the committee is expected to produce a full report on the
implications of the Estonia disaster before deciding whether to call a
special meeting to consider changes to the convention.
Mr Bengt-Erik Stenmark, Sweden's head of maritime safety, said the joint
Estonian-Finnish-Swedish team investigating the disaster had been told by
witnesses that the visor-style outer bow door was missing when the ship
sank. 'The outer door was lost,' he said. Witnesses saw 30-35cm of water on
the car deck, enough to destabilise the vessel, he added.
Inspectors carrying out urgent checks of all roll-on roll-off ferries
calling at Swedish ports said the port bow door on the Europa, a
3,000-passenger ferry operated by the Silja Line, suffered damaged hinges
during the storm and could not be opened.
The Europa, the biggest ferry of its kind sailing in the Baltic, was allowed
to sail for Finland last night after the Finnish-based Silja Line said it
would only load the ship by its aft doors until repairs had been carried
out.
A Finnish search boat last night located the wreck of the Estonia, at a
depth of 250-280 ft, 25 miles south-west of the Finnish island of Uto. The
investigating team plans to survey the ship with remote-controlled cameras
for evidence of what caused it to sink.
Swedish inspectors plan to scrutinise over the next week all 50
passenger-carrying roll-on roll-off ferries currently calling at Swedish
ports.
