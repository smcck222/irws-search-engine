FT  19 DEC 94 / Warburg attempts to rebuild character: The aftermath of
collapsed merger with Morgan Stanley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To suggest to Sir David Scholey, chairman of SG Warburg, that near the end
of a 30-year career with the UK's leading investment bank, he has been taken
for a ride by a US rival is to be met with a silent stare. 'No,' he says,
pausing for emphasis before repeating the word quietly. 'No.'
It is an understandably sensitive point for Sir David and Lord Cairns, the
bank's chief executive. After the collapse of their proposed merger with
Morgan Stanley last week, they picked up the Financial Times to read a brisk
dismissal by an executive of the US firm of their reason for merging.
Mr Stephen Waters, co-managing director of Morgan Stanley Europe, said that
Mercury Asset Management, the fund management company 75 per cent owned by
Warburg was 'the reason for us to do this deal'. There was no mention of
creating a global investment bank at a single stroke.
It was not what Sir David wanted to read, amid criticism from outside
Warburg - and privately from within - over the handling of the affair. By
Friday, he and Lord Cairns faced suggestions that they had acted naively,
and that Warburg no longer had credibility as an independent firm.
Sir David does not mince his words over Mr Waters' remarks, calling them 'a
subjective and selective alibi', and arguing that Mr Waters has 'a hell of a
containment job to do' in re-establishing the confidence of Morgan Stanley's
2,300 European staff.
The tension between Morgan Stanley's European employees and Warburg over how
European operations would have been run in a merged firm, and which firm
would bear the brunt of job cuts, spilled out at the end. Warburg faces its
own containment job in the coming weeks.
The bluntest view, expressed by some rivals and even some of Warburg's
employees, is that Lord Cairns should resign, because he is so closely
identified with the failed merger. Sir David insists that all the firm's
directors were involved, and no such sacrifice is called for.
'We think we were entirely right to pursue the opportunity of a merger in a
way that was constructive, imaginative, and thoroughly responsible. It was
not a move that was born out of dire need,' he says. He talks of the
inevitable risk of trying to do something 'radical and bold'.
The attempt broke down within days of the news leaking, and the two banks
having to issue a statement that they were in talks. Warburg has been blamed
for the disclosure, but Sir David says that executives wanted to involve as
many employees as possible, even at the risk of a leak.
'We took a very positive view that we were not going to do this the Salomon
Brothers/Phillips Brothers way (when the US groups merged) - asking everyone
to a country club on Saturday and locking them up until they accepted that
it was going to happen on Sunday.'
But the collapse leaves Warburg's management with several challenges: the
need to restore the confidence of staff, to convince outsiders that Warburg
can continue as an independent institution, and to ensure that it can
re-establish a harmonious relationship with MAM.
Sir David accepts that staff are bound to question what went wrong. 'Could
the management have handled it better? That is the question they are asking,
and how we all respond and react to that in the hours and days and weeks
ahead will be an important test for us.' He insists that there is no need
for Warburg to panic, about whether it can survive independently, arguing
that 'any suggestion that this puts the firm up for sale, puts it on the
line, or hangs it out to dry, or whatever, is dealer-speak rather than a
reflective management view'.
The problem will be to convince staff and outsiders that the bank can return
to its strategy of independent expansion. Sir David talks of a strategy
'fundamentally based on our pre-discussion strategy, but with adaptations
and variations' and of adding 'a new dynamism'.
Yet he and Lord Cairns will not specify what this means, insisting that
staff will be the first to be told. Warburg appears to be caught at a
crossroads, with poor first-half profits suggesting the need for cuts, but
the merger failure suggesting the need for more rapid growth.
Unless Warburg can make its case, it will find it hard to resist an approach
from an outsider. The logic of linking up with any other institution is
dismissed, with Lord Cairns talking of an 'uncanny' fit with Morgan Stanley
not found in rumoured predators such as HSBC Holdings.
There is also the question of whether Warburg's relations with MAM will be
damaged by the affair. It was MAM's demand for operational independence as
well as a premium offer for minority shareholders that convinced Morgan
Stanley there was no point in proceeding.
Sir David says MAM's board 'acted entirely professionally and properly, and
in accord with how we would expect them to act'. He says MAM's independence
remains vital, but admitted that Warburg will have to 'communicate and
re-affirm the continuing relationship' with MAM.
He talks of the merger collapse being 'very edifying and stimulating, and if
we react in the right way, as one's grandfather might say, it will be
character-building'. But convincing Warburg's employees and observers that
it can carry on alone will take all of Sir David's grandfatherly qualities.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Rolls-Royce in BMW supply deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rolls-Royce Motors, Vickers' luxury cars subsidiary, will this morning
announce an agreement under which BMW of Germany will supply components and
technology to help cut the cost to Rolls-Royce of producing its next
generation of models.
Rolls-Royce last night declined to give details of what has been agreed
after nearly a year of negotiations with BMW and Mercedes. However, it is
understood that BMW will supply Rolls-Royce with one of the most fundamental
of its needs - a modern V12 engine to replace Rolls-Royce's V8 power unit.
Mercedes and BMW produce these units and have been anxious to supply them to
Rolls-Royce because of the increased economies of scale. Neither Mercedes
nor BMW produce more than 10,000 of these engines a year. Rolls-Royce's
current annual car output is below 2,000 as a result of recession in some of
its main markets; but production in the past has exceeded 3,000 a year. With
BMW's help, Rolls-Royce plans to introduce new saloon cars and broaden its
model range, including the launch of a coupe codenamed Java.
There has been persistent media speculation of a 'race' between Mercedes and
BMW to become Rolls-Royce's long-term partner, with joint car development
and a possible equity stake - or even outright purchase - touted as the
intended outcome.
However Mr Peter Ward, Rolls-Royce chairman and chief executive, has said
that the company is seeking only components and technical collaboration and
that there is no reason why Rolls would not seek similar deals with other
potential suppliers, including Mercedes.
BMW, which bought the UK's Rover group at the beginning of this year,
already has a relationship with Rolls-Royce because it supplies several
electronic systems, and, through Rover, body panels.
Exploratory talks with Vickers two years ago about the possible purchase of
Rolls-Royce were discontinued and Sir Colin Chandler, Vickers' chief
executive, has recently stated that Rolls-Royce is not for sale in the
foreseeable future.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian state holding company has until midnight on December 31 to
complete the privatisation of Italy's state-owned steel industry, in line
with a deal struck by EU industry ministers in December 1993. The most
difficult sale is likely to be that of Ilva Laminati Piani, the flat steels
company, for which two rival consortia have tabled offers. IRI's directors
decided last week to pursue their examination of the bids and are certain to
have another meeting before Christmas to discuss the situation. If IRI fails
to sell ILP, the European Commission could demand the repayment of nearly
L5,000bn (Pounds 1.9bn) of state subsidies which Ilva was set to receive.

East Midlands Electricity will today bring the power results season to a
close when it announces profits and dividends for the half-year to September
30. Last October the company announced it was to give back Pounds 186m to
shareholders as a special dividend, or 85p per share. It chose this route
rather than buying back shares. The interim dividend may therefore be less
generous than other regional electricity companies have been able to
provide. Nonetheless, at least 15 per cent is expected and profits are
likely to be well ahead.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Trafalgar may launch Northern bid today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar House executives were meeting advisers last night amid
expectations that the conglomerate will launch a bid today for Northern
Electric, the regional power company.
With a final decision on timing to be taken early this morning, it was still
possible that the conglomerate would wait until the New Year to bid. However
that seemed unlikely last night.
Any takeover attempt will be fiercely contested by Northern Electric and
will probably face a forceful political lobby in the north-east of England
where the company is based.
Trafalgar is expected to pitch its opening offer at a relatively low premium
to the 985p share price at the close of business on Friday, when the company
was valued at about Pounds 1.1bn.
The company may leave the publication of a formal offer document and the
opening price until the new year.
Last week the government said it would not waive its 'golden share' in each
of the 12 regional electricity companies before the end of March. This
effectively ruled out the completion of a deal before then.
Trafalgar is likely to offer Northern shareholders either cash or
convertible preference shares. Hongkong Land, the Jardine Matheson arm which
owns 25 per cent of Trafalgar, is likely to underwrite some of the issue.
Trafalgar last week reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 45.6m for 1993-94,
against a loss of Pounds 347m the previous year. Northern on Monday
announced a 20.5 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 63.4m.
The 30 per cent dividend increase was one of the highest reported by
regional electricity companies in the current results season.
Trafalgar is thought to be undecided about the fate of Northern's management
should its takeover attempt succeed. Trafalgar's potential bid has
intensified speculation that the structure of the electricity industry will
be transformed in the next few years either by more takeovers or friendly
mergers.
It is also possible that other companies will enter the fray for Northern or
other regional electricity companies. Hanson and Tomkins have been suggested
as candidates.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Company News (This Week): Analysts divided on whether coal
is a rich seam - RJB Mining
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Private investors have until 3pm tomorrow to decide whether to subscribe for
shares in RJB Mining which are being issued to help the company finance its
purchase of the English regions of British Coal. RJB is financing its Pounds
815m bid and the working capital needed for the mines by borrowing Pounds
494m from banks and issuing 125m shares to raise Pounds 400m.
All of the shares have been placed with institutions, but up to 15 per cent
are placed only conditionally to allow 'retail' investors, the general
public, to buy them.
The shares are being offered at 320p. Trade in RJB's existing shares was
suspended in mid-October to allow the company to negotiate a deal with the
government and raise the necessary money. The company expects to make
pre-tax profits of Pounds 120m next year from the businesses being acquired,
putting the shares on a prospective price/earnings ratio of 6.5. The yield
on this year's forecast dividend is 4.9 per cent.
But if RJB has got its sums right then the real excitement will come later
in the decade. By 1999 it expects to making pre-tax profits of Pounds 220m.
Between now and then there could be very substantial increases in dividend
payments. However mining is considered a risky business by the stock market
and some of RJB's competitors question whether the company has got its sums
right. They believe it has over-estimated both the size of the market and
the prices it can fetch for its coal.
Stockbrokers' analysts are divided, with some pointing to the rapid
reduction in costs which they expect RJB to be able to achieve and others to
what they consider to be over-optimism.
The results of the retail offer will be announced on Wednesday and shares
will resume trading on December 30, the day RJB is scheduled to take over
the pits.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Companies face growing crime risk: Organised theft and fraud
set to replace terrorism as top concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The threat of organised crime will become a top item on boardroom agendas
next year, according to a report published today by Control Risks, the
London-based international corporate security and intelligence consultants.
The report identifies four main reasons why financial crime and fraud will
replace terrorism as the most pressing security concern for international
business: Increasing sophistication by criminal groups in the use of banking
instruments and exploitation of recently-opened borders to trade and
investment. 'The globalisation of legitimate business is matched by the
globalisation of organised crime,' says the report.
Involvement of 'demobilised' and 'jobless' terrorists in racketeering.
Intensifying social dislocation caused by urban migration and growing
economic disparities.
Absence of predominant ideologies: 'In the 1990s the emphasis is on personal
enrichment . . . disenchanted youths who might once have turned to radical
politics now are more likely to model themselves on successful
entrepreneurs, including those who operate on the wrong side of the law.'
The report includes the results of a British companies' security outlook
survey which singles out Russia, China, Nigeria and Egypt as the perceived
areas of highest risk for doing business.
The survey was conducted among a representative sample of more than 100 top
UK companies.
Topping the list is Nigeria, which Control Risks describes as a country in
which business has been 'caught up in opposition strikes and protests, crime
and corruption'.
In Russia, the report notes, 'extortion and racketeering are currently the
major threats posed by organised crime . . . but foreign business also faces
the threat of kidnapping and violent crime'.
China is described as the world's largest emerging market, but one in which
the environment for foreign business is fraught with difficulties.
The main problem is an 'archaic and communist-inspired legal system' which
cannot cope with business disputes. 'Large legal loopholes leave ample scope
for institutionalised corruption,' the report states.
While agreeing with the surveyed UK companies about the extent of the risks
in Russia, Nigeria and China, Control Risks claims the threat in Egypt is
overestimated.
It notes what it claims are the Egyptian government's successes in combating
terrorism, which have brought about a 'more stable security environment'.
But it is critical of the progress on privatisation and the government's
refusal to devalue the Egyptian pound.
Control Risks describes Algeria as the 'most dangerous country in the world
for foreign business', predicting growing political instability provoked by
violence between Islamic extremists and the security forces.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Gangs move into bootleg beer business: Protection rackets
put pressure on pub landlords to allow illegal sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Criminal gangs that run pub protection rackets are reported to be muscling
in on Britain's booming business in cross-Channel bootlegging by
intimidating inner-city pub landlords.
Bootleggers have told some Sunderland and Newcastle licensees to co-operate
in making it easier to distribute illegally imported beer, according to Mr
Frank Nicholson, managing director of Vaux, the Sunderland-based brewer and
pub owner.
The government has refused to cut import duties on alcoholic drinks and
tobacco to make imports from France less lucrative. And it has played down
reports that organised crime has infiltrated beer bootlegging, although it
recognises the problem exists with tobacco imports.
However, Mr Nicholson says, there is clear evidence that some bootlegging is
being organised by the criminals who run pub protection rackets.
'I am alarmed because it is a new element to an old vice, and the avenues to
do it are very easy to exploit. It is a neat extension of their business,'
he said.
Bootleggers have 'suggested' actions to some Vaux licensees. The most
popular include: selling smuggled beer in their bars; turning a blind eye to
it being sold in their car parks; and opening their pubs later than usual to
ensure more people are at home when the bootleggers take a sales trip around
the neighbourhood.
'I have seen myself bootleggers selling beer from a van outside one of our
Sunderland pubs,' said Mr Nicholson. 'The pub car park is a good meeting
point.'
Protection racketeers often threaten landlords with violence or damage to
their property, although Mr Nicholson said he was not yet aware of any
bootleg-related violence.
Typical consequences of failure to comply with protection rackets are damage
to property and starting fights in bars.
Rumours of intimidation by bootleggers began to circulate in the trade
earlier this year, but Mr Nicholson is the first brewer to go on the record
about the problems his landlords face.
A London brewer told Mr Nicholson of a similar experience in Croydon, south
London, when they met at the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association
earlier this week.
Mr Nicholson, who said the problem was confined to tough, inner-city
neighbourhoods, has also had direct reports of intimidation in Manchester.
'Organised gangs and intimidation are an inevitable part of bootlegging,'
the association said.
The brewing industry estimates that some 3.5 per cent to 4 per cent of beer
sold in Britain - or some 15 per cent of beer consumed at home - is imported
from France.
Vaux encourages its landlords to tell it about cases of intimidation,
bootlegging and protection rackets so it can work with the police to stamp
them out. But Mr Nicholson said he was sympathetic to those who did not want
to talk to the brewery because of the dangers. He says the solution is
two-fold: the government must reduce the financial attractions of
bootlegging, while brewers and publicans must work with the police to combat
crime.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Aid to North Korea under threat after downing of US
helicopter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US was trying yesterday to secure the return of a captured army pilot
and the body of his co-pilot after their helicopter was shot down in North
Korea. The incident prompted US calls for a suspension of aid programmes.
It came at an awkward time for both countries, following their recent
agreement to halt Pyongyang's nuclear programme in exchange for the opening
of diplomatic ties and economic aid.
President Bill Clinton said in a statement released by the White House that
the helicopter had 'strayed into North Korean airspace' on Saturday. He
declared that the 'tragic loss of life was unnecessary' and that 'we are
using all available channels to press for an early resolution of this
matter'. The situation is potentially embarrassing to the US because the
helicopter appeared to violate the truce agreement that ended the 1950-53
Korean war. Aircraft from either side are not supposed to fly near the
demilitarised zone between North and South Korea, let alone cross it.
Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said the helicopter, which was on a
training mission, had strayed into North Korea because of a navigational
error. North Korea claimed that it then shot down the helicopter.
Republican Senator Pete Domenici, incoming budget committee chairman, said
yesterday that unless North Korea co-operated over the incident, the US
should not hand over funds promised for building safer nuclear reactors.
Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan was asked if the helicopter issue
should prompt the US to delay implementation of the nuclear deal.
'That is exactly what the (North) Koreans should be asking,' he replied.
'They are not exactly in an enviable position, are they? Their dictator (the
late President Kim Il Sung) is dead. Their economy is dead.'
Analysts believe that North Korea may try to use the incident for propaganda
purposes and to extract new concessions from the US. But North Korea is
unlikely to try to use returning the pilot as a bargaining chip as this
would give conservative US critics of the recent nuclear accord extra
reasons for opposing it.
North Korean officials have recently expressed concern that the new
Republican-controlled Congress may try to block the nuclear pact, which
critics believe offers too many concessions to Pyongyang.
The US has called for a meeting of the military armistice commission, which
supervises the truce, to discuss the situation. But North Korea may refuse
to attend: it withdrew from the commission earlier this year in an attempt
to pressure the US to sign a peace treaty to end the Korean war formally.
North Korea may use the current visit to Pyongyang of Mr Bill Richardson, a
Democratic representative from New Mexico, to arrange the pilot's release.
Mr Richardson yesterday held talks with senior North Korean officials on the
helicopter incident.

FT  19 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Many commentators hoped the weight of global money that flooded Hong Kong
last year would calm its notorious volatility. They have been disappointed.
The colony's Hang Seng index rose 30 per cent last December. This year
concern over interest rates, combined with gloomy political and economic
news from China, has sent the market plummeting 31 per cent.
The problem is not so much political uncertainty: the colony has had 150
years to come to terms with this. In fact, Chinese intransigence is now
rather more predictable than US interest rate movements, which have hit Hong
Kong directly through its currency peg to the US dollar.
The two-year bull market was fed on interest rates far below the rate of
inflation, which encouraged capital flows into stocks and property. This
year, interest rates exceeded inflation for the first time since 1991 - and
as a result the liquidity bubble has burst.
With 60 per cent of the Hong Kong stock-market earnings deriving from
property and finance, the outlook is dispiriting: property developers will
see profits growth more than halved from the 58 per cent achieved in 1993.
The banks have suffered because of slower growth in their mortgage books.
Much of the rest of corporate Hong Kong has also been hit due to its
tendency to dabble in the property market.
If the interest rate cycle has stifled one source of liquidity, China's
economic mandarins have removed another. The problem is not so much China's
austerity measures, which will have limited direct impact on Hong Kong
corporate earnings. The issue is rather the cash which last year flowed out
of China and pushed up shares and property prices in the colony. More rigid
financial controls have put a stop to that. They have also soured Hong
Kong's attractions to fund managers as a China play.
Hong Kong is a highly geared option on the US interest rate cycle. So it is
hard to imagine that the worst is over for the market until that cycle
turns, despite last week's 5 per cent rally. Increased capital flows from
China would spur a revival, but Beijing can hardly relax fiscal restrictions
now. Volatility will remain, but the market trend is likely to be downwards.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Could the common international accounting standard be an idea whose time has
finally come? Sir Bryan Carsberg's move next year to become
secretary-general of the International Accounting Standards Committee, which
draws up model financial reporting rules, suggests it may. If Sir Bryan
displays the same vigour and independence in his new job as he has in his
present position as the UK's director-general of fair trading, the cause of
common accounting standards could receive a big push.
The rationale for common accounting rules is similar to that for any lingua
franca: a babble of standards prevents investors making meaningful
cross-border comparison of price/earnings ratios and other valuation
yardsticks. With companies increasingly raising funds outside their home
markets and investors keen to build diversified global portfolios, this
incomprehension creates undesirable impediments to the free flow of capital.
The concept of common standards is fine, but those produced by IASC have yet
to make an impact on capital markets. Scores of countries use them as a
model for their own local standards. But the rules are not recognised by the
world's main stock markets - New York, London and Tokyo. Unsurprisingly, if
a multinational like Daimler-Benz wishes to approach international
shareholders, it adopts US rather than international accounting standards.
The IASC is keen for its standards to be recognised by the big stock
exchanges, and indeed the New York Stock Exchange may in time make such a
move as a way of encouraging a greater number of foreign companies to list
in the US. Fair enough. But official recognition on its own will not lead to
widespread endorsement by investors. Too often the IASC decides on rules by
picking the lowest common denominator among its large membership. That leads
to soggy standards; and investors will always prefer firm US rules to soggy
international ones.
The alternative is for the IASC to improve its standards by single-mindedly
putting investors' interests first - for example, by embracing greater
disclosure and rooting out 'creative' accounting techniques. Even relatively
investor-friendly standards bodies such as the UK's Accounting Standards
Board sometimes have to compromise their principles in the face of pressure
from company lobbies. The IASC need not. It would then set the standards to
which others aspire.

FT  19 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Saatchi isn't working
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi have not merely deposed an advertising
icon; they have introduced a striking new dimension to corporate governance
in the UK. It is common in the US, but rare in Britain, for minority
shareholders to band together in pursuit of limited but specific changes -
as they did in this case to seek the scrapping of Mr Maurice Saatchi's
options package.
But such moves are a less clumsy mechanism for effecting change or
correcting poor performance than hostile takeovers. All too often UK
institutional shareholders berate management performance in private, while
doing and saying nothing in public. Fund managers' generally lily-livered
stance on executive pay - PosTel excepted - is but one example, creating the
suspicion that institutions will go out of their way not to offend the
directors who dole out lucrative asset management contracts.
Mr Saatchi's departure, the by-product but not the objective of the
shareholder pressure, should not be regretted if the group ends up being
better managed. The risk remains, of course, that, by removing a personality
who not only gave the business its name but also commanded fierce personal
loyalty from some big clients, Harris Associates, M &amp; G and their allies
have seriously wounded the company they were trying to improve.
An advertising agency is a more fragile organism than some underperforming
industrial conglomerate. Nevertheless, it is also arguable that the more
austere advertising market of the 1990s needs unglamorous professional
management more than a cult of personality.

Inclining to the view that Internet bores deserve anything that comes their

hapless surfer in cyberspace.
Wishing to travel from London Waterloo to bijou Barnes, 20 minutes down the
line in a south- westerly direction, he consulted Internet's railway
timetable.
The system quickly found the route. Travel from Waterloo on the 21.39 to
Brussels on Eurostar. Return to Ostend, take a ferry to Ramsgate, a train to
Waterloo and a train to Barnes, where you will arrive at 7.19 the following
morning.

One of the latest additions to London's National Portrait Gallery - a Nigel
Boonham sculpture of the English National Opera's former general director,
Peter Jonas - doubtless looks very fine in the midst of its 20th century
collection. But can that really have been its intended destination?
Boonham, whose previous subjects include the Princess of Wales and Lord
Runcie, was commissioned by the ENO to do a bronze of Jonas when the latter
departed in the summer of last year. All quite normal - Jonas had been in
situ for eight years, and had been widely regarded as a brilliant director.
Before, that is, things tailed off towards the end.
The sculpture had been finished for months before it mysteriously popped up
at the NPG just recently. Hope Jonas, now installed at the Bavarian State
Opera, won't act prima donna-ish about this minor shift of key . . .

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Observer is also a trifle worried about BT's in-house maths expertise, if
the specimen on show in the company's latest report to shareholders is
anything to go by.
A sharp-eyed reader points out that BT, boasting about its price
competitiveness, seems to think that, if it keeps its prices stable while
retail prices rise by 50 per cent, it has achieved a 50 per cent reduction
in real terms for its customers. Would that life were so simple.
It is, however, the mistake that chairman Sir Iain Vallance makes when he
boasts that, in the 10 years since the company was privatised, retail prices
rose 57 per cent in the UK, while a basket of BT's main services rose by
'less than 9 per cent'.
Thus 'overall prices paid by customers have been virtually halved in those
10 years'. The maths whizzes at BT seem to have subtracted 9 per cent from
57 per cent to arrive at 48 per cent.
Observer's suggestion is that the answer is actually (48/157)%, or a rather
more modest 30.6 per cent decline, in real terms, in prices paid by the
customer.
Ah well. Just a word of warning to Vallance when he is next working out his
salary.

Standing for election to become a common councilman of the City of London
recently, PR man Peter Jennings made the mistake of suggesting he might like
to become Lord Mayor one day. The powers that be recoiled in horror at such
a bald statement of ambition. But the obscure and oh-so-discreet system by
which Lord Mayors have hitherto emerged is on the line, judging by current
shenanigans within the Court of Aldermen.
Change was in the air earlier this year when Neil Young resigned. The court
had reviewed the batting order for mayoral office, and Young heard his name
would not 'go forward'. So Malcolm Matson, a businessman who has made his
money in cable networks, was voted in by the Bread Street ward as his
successor, but he failed to secure the approval of the aldermen themselves.
Incensed at the blackballing - for which no reasons are given - Matson last
Friday obtained an injunction stopping another election being called. As a
result, a system that was last considered in detail in 1834 will be subject
to judicial review. Matson says he has the financial resources to 'see
justice prevails'.
It could well be that, 160 years on, the courts will be a good deal more
sensitive to the exigencies of democracy. The proceedings promise a
fascinating insight into the darker side of City politics. And there is also
the embarrassing possibility that the aldermen will be forced in the end to
accept Matson. At least he would provide some company for Tony Bull, who has
been in a rather awkward position this year since he chose not to stand
down, despite also being passed over as a future Lord Mayor.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Evading US fiscal reality
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
US politicians have spent the weeks since the congressional elections
'learning the lessons' of the Republicans' victory. Most now believe they
must promise the voters a dubious fiscal cocktail in the years ahead. The US
is not the only country in which economic realities seem increasingly at
odds with political ones. Few, however, can boast such a powerful consensus
in favour of ignoring the first.
The post-November strategy which Mr Clinton finally unveiled last Thursday
centres around middle-class tax cuts and departmental downsizing. He pledged
to 'be straight with the American people' about the real consequences of
these budgetary decisions. On paper, at least, the plan does add up rather
better than many of the competing proposals currently on offer on Capitol
Hill. But none paints an honest picture of the economic realities facing the
US in the short and medium term.
Mr Clinton offered tax cuts for 'middle-income' households worth about
Dollars 60bn over five years. He observed the post-November rules of the
game by promising to offset these with cuts in discretionary government
spending, rather than tampering with federal benefits to individuals
('entitlements') or raising other tax revenues. As many remarked, the speech
echoed many a latter-day Republican theme as well as some of his 1992
election campaign. Characteristically, he aimed to please everyone and so,
perhaps, pleased relatively few. Certainly there was little to prompt either
Republicans or Democrats to forsake their more ambitious tax-cutting gambits
when passing next year's budget.
Reform package
It is to Mr Clinton's credit that he merely echoed these proposals, many of
which were on show last week, rather than trying to out-bid them. But a more
courageous president would have picked another model altogether for his
efforts, namely the ambitious fiscal reform package put forward a few days
earlier by Senators Robert Kerrey and John Danforth.
The Senators' plans are unique in admitting that neither tax cuts nor an
unchanged system of entitlements is consistent with long-term US fiscal
stability. The federal budget deficit will begin to rise again in 1996.
Interest payments and social benefits will, on the basis of current
commitments, consume nearly three-quarters of all federal revenues by 2003,
and 100 per cent 10 years later. By 2030, total federal expenditures are
projected to exceed 37 per cent of GDP, compared with just 22 per cent
today. If policies remain unchanged, by then this year's modest Dollars 22bn
surplus of Social Security tax revenues over outlays would have turned into
an annual deficit of over Dollars 450bn. It should go without saying that
this will not happen. The only question is when, and how, it will be
stopped.
Small steps
Messrs Kerrey and Danforth proposed a few measures to stop the rot, such as
gradually raising the retirement age from 65 to 70 and means-testing some
benefits, fewer than a fifth of which go to poor households. Mr Clinton was
not alone in finding these and other measures unthinkable. None of the other
members of the commission on entitlement reform - chaired by Mr Kerrey -
could stomach them either. It broke up agreeing on only the need for
fundamental reform, and some minor, though useful, changes in the procedure
for assessing the budget.
Mr Clinton's 1993 deficit reduction package included some very small steps
towards lowering benefits for wealthy households. With the recovery entering
a buoyant fifth year of recovery, the short-term case for further
retrenchment is now even stronger. Meanwhile, the Republicans claim that
their corporate and individual tax cuts would be accompanied by enough
spending cuts to be consistent with further deficit reduction. Yet they hope
to reverse even Mr Clinton's modest 1993 changes to entitlements.
The president was right on Thursday to admit, implicitly at least, that the
budget would never be balanced without benefit changes at least as ambitious
as the Kerrey-Danforth programme. He may also be right in thinking that
endorsing the latter would be political suicide in the current US climate.
In the long run, however, voters are unlikely to reward either Mr Clinton or
Congress for suggesting that this type of reform could painlessly be
deferred.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Why Bill signed Newt's contract: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing better illustrates the shift in political power in Washington than
Bill Clinton's address to the nation last week. Instead of wresting the
political initiative from Republicans, Clinton in effect admitted that he
had erred and promised to mend his ways. The defining features of the first
two years of his presidency were dropped. Deficit reduction became a dead
letter, as did fond hopes of expanding the government's role in healthcare
and worker training. The new policy objectives are frankly Reaganesque: to
reduce the burden of taxation and get government off people's backs.
Clinton's 'bill of rights' (an absurd misuse of language) consists of a
ragbag of proposed tax breaks for 'middle class' families (American parlance
for anybody who is neither poor nor affluent) estimated to cost Dollars 60bn
over five years. It includes child tax credits, deductions for college and
vocational education, and concessions on retirement saving. The White House
swears it will be paid for by cutting the federal bureaucracy and freezing
domestic spending, but it has yet to produce the details.
As tax policy, the Clinton proposal is little short of disastrous. The
increased deductions for children championed by Republicans can perhaps be
defended on the grounds that the tax system has become less generous toward
children in recent decades. But the new element in the Clinton scheme - a
tax break for post-secondary education - represents a damaging (and
potentially expensive) retreat from fiscal neutrality. Instead of
introducing extra fiscal concessions, the US needs to build on the
achievements of the bipartisan 1986 tax act by broadening the base further
and cutting marginal rates.
But close analysis of the Clinton plan is a waste of energy. The crucial
point to remember is that Democrats no longer control the congressional
budget machinery. Republicans will be as contemptuous of Clinton's fiscal
proposals as Democrats were of the Reagan and Bush budgets in the 1980s.
Before Clinton spoke, senior Republicans were already calling for much
larger tax cuts. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, a likely presidential
contender in 1996, wants to double the dependent exemption for children, a
measure that would cost Dollars 124bn over five years. There is thus no
point worrying whether the Clinton proposals would increase the deficit; the
fiscally-relevant question is whether Republicans will cut spending
sufficiently to offset their proposed tax cuts.
I am cautiously optimistic that they will, although I would not blame bond
investors for remaining sceptical. To believe that tax cuts will mean higher
deficits, just because they did in the 1980s, is to fail to grasp the
changing nature of US politics. Tax cuts used to mean higher deficits
largely because the Democrats who controlled the House of Representatives
passionately opposed deep cuts in domestic spending. Reagan was thus forced
to choose between no tax cuts or tax cuts plus large deficits.
The mindset that created that impasse largely disappeared in last month's
political revolution. 'Liberal' Democrats were vanquished on November 8. The
incoming conservatives relish the prospect of 'downsizing' the federal
government. If they shy away from spending cuts and allow the deficit to
balloon, while simultaneously pushing for a constitutional amendment
requiring a balanced budget, they will lose all credibility with voters.
The larger question is whether Clinton was wise to repackage himself as a
moderate conservative. I suspect he was. There are two possible explanations
for the Democrats' defeat last month that might be dubbed 'disgruntled
voters' and 'ideological shift'. On the first view, voters (especially
blue-collar white males) lashed out at the ruling Democrats primarily
because they were feeling economically insecure. If congressional
Republicans do not create genuine economic prosperity in the next two years,
the argument runs, they too will feel the voters' wrath.
There is obviously something in this argument. The rapid productivity growth
of the immediate postwar decades has not yet been re-established and real
wages are consequently rising slowly for many groups. Yet it was absurd of
Clinton to talk of Americans 'hurting', as though the economy were still
mired in recession. More than 5m jobs have been created since he took
office. The unemployment rate is down to 5.6 per cent. Gross private
investment is up nearly 30 per cent. Vehicle and new home sales are up about
20 per cent and running close to the peak levels of the 1980s. People who
feel economically insecure do not spend this readily.
The election results thus almost certainly reflect a deeper-seated
ideological shift. Times really are changing. A couple of generations after
Franklin Roosevelt's 'New Deal', Americans have finally lost confidence in
the ability of government to solve problems.
Think of the hardening of attitudes on welfare: the majority view now is
that strict time limits should be placed on benefits. Think of the
healthcare debate: as soon as the Clinton plan was perceived as a government
takeover of private provision, it was doomed. Think of the desire to curb
politicians' powers: 22 states have passed legislation limiting the terms of
elected representatives. Speaker-elect Newt Gingrich may be the bete noire
of Washington intellectuals. But they, not he, are the aberration. Hence
Clinton's decision to risk an egregious flip-flop and dress himself in
Republican clothing.

FT  19 DEC 94 / High-risk strategy in global game: Talks on China's
application to rejoin Gatt are nearing a climax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the world's longest and tensest diplomatic poker games is nearing a
climax. As negotiators on China's application to rejoin the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade prepare to leave Geneva for the Christmas
holidays at the end of this week, the time has come for bluffs to be called.
How the game is played out in the next few days may determine whether a
formula can be found for China's orderly integration into the multilateral
trade system - or whether Beijing carries out its repeated threats to walk
away from the bargaining table and pursue go-it-alone economic policies.
Either way, the stakes are momentous. With a quarter of the world's
population and one of its fastest growing economies, China is already a
magnet to foreign exporters and investors. On recent trends, it may overtake
the US to become the world's biggest economic powerhouse before the middle
of the next century.
China's erratic pace of reform, often chaotic business conditions and
continued adherence to many of the practices of a command economy will not
be easy to align with multilateral trade rules and disciplines. The task
threatens to impose serious strains on the Gatt and its successor, the World
Trade Organisation, which will be established at the start of next year.
But it is widely accepted that keeping China out of the WTO would be even
worse, and could turn the country into an international rogue elephant.
Paraphrasing former US President Lyndon Johnson, one trade negotiator says:
'The choice is between having China inside the tent spitting out, or outside
spitting in.'
Talks on the resumption of China's Gatt membership, which it unilaterally
suspended after the communist revolution in 1949, have been under way
sporadically for almost eight years. But Beijing has recently raised the
stakes to new levels by setting a deadline for their completion.
Mr Long Yong-tu, China's chief negotiator, has told Gatt members that unless
a 'substantive' agreement is reached by the end of the year, his government
will offer no further concessions and will not seek to restart talks.
Indeed, he is reported to have said that Beijing might even start closing
its market to western exporters.
The heightened sense of urgency has encouraged Mr Pierre-Louis Girard,
chairman of the Gatt working party dealing with China's application, to
order its members to pull out all the stops in an effort to have a formal
accession protocol ready by the end of the year.
However, by all accounts the talks are still proceeding at a snail's pace,
and most negotiators see little chance of a last-minute breakthrough.
'I've seen miracles happen in Geneva before,' says one. 'But I don't expect
one this time. There is just so much work left to do.'
If that forecast proves correct, Beijing will confront a dilemma. Though it
has not totally ruled out an extension of talks into next year, saying it
would be ready to discuss 'technical' issues, it will be hard put to dress
up results so far as the 'substantive' deal in which it has invested so much
political prestige.
What China would do then is anybody's guess. Some observers in Geneva fear
it might succumb to pressure from hardliners to abandon the membership
talks, on the grounds that foreign exporters and investors are so desperate
to participate in the country's economy that it has nothing to lose.
Mr Booth Gardner, the US ambassador to Gatt, is more sanguine. 'I don't
think China's threat to pull out is a bluff,' he says. 'But as long as their
negotiators can return to Beijing saying some progress is being made, they
will stay in the game.'
Mr Jeffrey Garten, US under-secretary of commerce for international trade,
believes Beijing's economic self-interest will prevail over political pique.
China's failure to enter the WTO, he argues, could damage international
confidence in its economy and scare away much-needed foreign investment. 'I
am optimistic that in the end our differences will be worked out,' he says.
But even if breakdown is averted, stubborn obstacles remain. It is also not
clear that the protagonists in the talks will enjoy any increased room for
manoeuvre.
China's negotiating position is widely thought to be constrained by a
looming leadership struggle, which has caused even economic reformers to
take a hard line. Some western observers say China's negotiators in Geneva
recognise they must offer more concessions, but they have failed to win the
authority to do so.
Beijing, in turn, blames the slow progress on unreasonable demands by
Washington. The US, which has taken the lead in the negotiations, has said
it wants China to join the WTO, but has made clear its determination to
strike a hard bargain.
The Clinton administration is under strong domestic pressure to stick to its
guns. After a humiliating retreat this year from its threat to deprive
China's exports of Most Favoured Nation status over human rights, any
further signs of weakness would provide powerful political ammunition to the
new Republican-controlled Congress.
US business leaders argue strongly that the WTO accession talks are the last
chance to exact trade concessions from China, after the Chinese failure to
fulfil promises made in a bilateral memorandum of understanding on trade
agreed with the US more than two years ago. US resolve has been further
strengthened by a 27 per cent rise in its trade deficit with China to
Dollars 21bn in the year to November.
Many other Gatt members - particularly developing countries - have in the
past accused Washington of excessive obduracy. But recently, the tide of
opinion has begun to turn, as a growing number of governments have started
to find fault with Beijing.
One reason is China's demand that it join the WTO on terms more generous
than those enjoyed by developing countries in the Gatt. As well as angering
many developing countries, there are fears that meeting this demand could
set an undesirable precedent for the membership negotiations under way with
Russia and other former communist states.
Some industrialised countries would be ready to allow China to subscribe
initially only to a set of core WTO obligations, and adopt the rest
according to an agreed timetable, provided Beijing made reasonable bilateral
offers on market access for their goods and services.
However, western negotiators say Beijing's offers to date have been
niggardly, lacking in clarity and hedged with restrictions. For instance, it
is said still to be balking at basic commitments on regulations governing
imports and foreign exchange, and wants to limit foreign banking rights to
about 20 cities.
So unyielding has Beijing's position been that some Gatt members are
starting to wonder whether it really understands what is at stake in the
negotiations. 'We are like ships that pass in the night,' says a western
diplomat.
A negotiator from a developing country puts the point more bluntly: 'China
seems to think it is dealing with the United Nations, where everything
consists of grand political posturing. It has yet to recognise that Gatt is
all about negotiating on detailed, specific and concrete issues.'
On this view, Beijing needs to undergo a fundamental change in psychology.
But even if the talks continue beyond the end of this month, it has little
time left to do so. Many Gatt members say that, in the absence of any
breakthroughs, it would be impractical to drag them out beyond next summer.
However, they also admit privately that whatever progress is achieved, the
final decision on China's admission to the WTO will come down to a political
judgment. It will turn on an assessment of whether Beijing will live up to
its commitments - or whether it will wreak havoc by blithely disregarding
the rules.
That is a question to which nobody in Geneva pretends to know the answer.
Even those who argue strongly that China's WTO admission is essential for
global economic reasons admit that it is a high-risk strategy.
'The real nightmare,' says one, 'would be to have China inside the tent,
spitting in.'

FT  19 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Tougher rules for pensions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
How much more secure will members of the UK's occupational pension schemes
be if the Pensions Bill, published last Friday, is enacted as proposed? That
is the test, given the bill's origins in the report of the Goode Committee,
which was set up in the immediate aftermath of the Maxwell pension scheme
outrages.
Many of the Goode recommendations have been adopted. For instance, active
scheme members will be entitled to appoint a third of the trustees; an
Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority, albeit of a rather passive kind,
will be set up; and a new Pensions Compensation Board will be able to levy
other schemes and compensate victims when a scheme fails to meet its
liabilities due to misappropriation of assets and the bankruptcy of the
employer.
But the minimum solvency requirement that formed an important part of the
Goode proposals has been significantly watered down. Under pressure from
companies, the valuation basis has been altered to permit a greater emphasis
on the assumed higher returns on equities rather than government bonds, and
more time will be allowed for schemes to correct solvency crises.
Moreover there is no sign yet that the government will issue the special
indexed securities which the Goode Committee requested should be made
available to schemes winding up, so that they could economically secure
their future pensions liabilities.
Highlighted
The problems were highlighted by the receivership of shipbuilder Swan
Hunter. Although this Pounds 60m scheme was regarded as solvent by its
actuaries, and was sufficiently well-funded to have complied with the
proposed minimum solvency requirement, the trustees announced in September
that not all the pension benefits could be met, with some being reduced by
as much as 40 per cent.
Essentially this kind of problem arises because smaller schemes cannot be
run economically as closed funds when the employer goes bankrupt, or for
other reasons decides not to continue the scheme. The assumed high long-term
investment returns are replaced by much lower interest rates when
liabilities are transferred to life assurance companies.
Some in the actuarial profession are worried that a so-called minimum
solvency test will prove seriously misleading, and will imply a degree of
security for future pension rights that in reality does not exist. It is
also worth pointing out that Mirror Group pensioners would not have
benefited from a compensation scheme of the type planned, because their
employer continued to trade.
Serious deficiency
Other Maxwell companies did fail, of course, and their pensioners would have
been able to claim. Fraud is not always as clear-cut as in the Maxwell
example, however. Many cases of serious deficiency arise because of
imprudent investment or a desire by the trustees to help the sponsoring
company through a crisis by deferring contributions or even by buying assets
such as property. The presence of member trustees with jobs at stake will
not necessarily reduce these risks.
The question is whether the other measures, such as the imposition of a duty
on auditors and actuaries to inform the regulator about apparent
irregularities, will make an important difference. Certainly there are
powerful threats of fines or imprisonment when trustees breach rules.
In many cases these provisions seem likely to be effective. No one can rule
out the possibility of rogues misappropriating pension scheme assets in
future, especially among smaller companies, but at least a safety net will
exist for these serious abuses.
The bigger problem may well be whether the reasonable expectations of scheme
members will be met when the sponsoring companies get into trouble. To
insist on complete security would be to impose much higher funding costs on
all companies with final salary-linked schemes, for the sake of the small
proportion of future problem cases. But should not scheme members be made
aware that they are carrying a residual risk?
The Pensions Bill represents a clear improvement over what has applied
before. But there is a danger that it will generate an expectations gap that
will haunt politicians in the future.

FT  19 DEC 94 / How to miss on the inflation target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last Thursday, another unnoticed official report* was published, that of the
Retail Prices Index Advisory Committee (on which I sit) on the treatment of
owner-occupier housing costs. Because of the government's short-sighted
policy of restricting copies of such documents, most journalists have seen
only the press release. This covered merely the majority report which
favoured continuing to measure homeowners' costs in the RPI by mortgage
interest payments, but with a slight modification to include an element of
home depreciation which makes hardly any difference.
The origins of the report, over which the committee toiled for 2 1/2 years,
was Whitehall's concern that using mortgage interest payments to measure
home ownership costs had a perverse effect on public perceptions of
inflation, the conduct of economic policy and the success of that policy.
The mechanism by which we shoot ourselves in the foot is straightforward.
When governments worry about inflation, they sanction interest rate
increases which feed back into the RPI. The result is worsening inflationary
expectations, reduced confidence and attempts at wage and price push by
unions and employers. This leads to still greater inflationary worries,
still more interest rate increases and still worse inflationary
expectations. The vicious circle can be, and has been, broken by
sufficiently determined policy, but at an unnecessarily high cost in lost
output and employment.
The committee majority believed that the job of the RPI was not merely to
measure inflation but to provide an automatic adjustment for incomes, for
instance in pay and benefits. In fact, the idea that everyone can contract
out of the effects of a credit squeeze is sheer illusion, which simply
postpones adjustments and makes their timing perverse.
As the committee sat, Whitehall seemed to get cold feet about reforming the
RPI. Once it became clear that there was no one clear alternative measure of
inflation, only a battery of indicators, some officials took fright lest
negotiators should always go for the highest variant. But the need for such
a battery is just a fact of life. The phoney inflation peak of nearly 9 per
cent in 1990, when the economy was already entering recession and which did
so much damage, was due not only to mortgage interest rates, but also to
poll tax effects and the impact of a temporary oil price explosion before
the Gulf war.
I am, however, inured to governments losing interest in their own original
standpoint and I persevered with a minority report.
The root of the problem is that the previous method of estimating
homeowners' costs by means of the equivalent rent for similar accommodation
has not been available since the collapse of the market in private letting.
There is no one perfect alternative and my own proposals are designed to
entrench and build on what has already been achieved in interpreting the
RPI.
To start with: the underlying rate, or RPIX, should now be given equal
prominence to the headline RPI in official pronouncements. As a consequence,
the headline RPI should cease to be the sole legal definition of the index.
This is, in any case, the way the world is going. Price indices being
developed by the European Commission are certain to exclude home ownership
costs as being too difficult to measure and compare between EU members.
While the committee was going round in circles, the Bank of England had
developed further indices to help measure inflation. These include RPIY,
which excludes some indirect taxes as well as mortgage interest payments.
There is also the housing adjusted index, HARP, which attempts to treat the
purchase of houses like that of any other consumer durable. My
recommendation is that the Bank of England should update every month the
indicators in its quarterly Inflation Report and indeed publish them
independently. The Bank could do this straightaway. But the CSO (Central
Statistics Office), too, should get round to publishing a wider list of
indicators attached to the RPI press notice, including the new comprehensive
Inflation Index on which it is working.
My final recommendation may be the most controversial. This is that the RPI
Advisory Committee is an anachronism which should be placed into honourable
retirement. Apart from it being a corporatist survival, there is the basic
fact that a price index cannot be devised by a varying selection from a
group of 21 people sitting round a table every few weeks. The director of
the CSO should have the same responsibility for the RPI that he has for
other statistical series.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: The right person to lead WTO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HARRY L FREEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader concerning choice of a leader for the World Trade
Organisation (December 14) is right on the mark. As important as the
agreements reached in the Uruguay Round are to the future of world trade, so
is the choice of the first leader of the WTO and the launch of this new
entity. For those of us who worked on the round for years, it would be
frustrating to see all of the efforts made to reach a broad and strong
agreement frustrated by a poor leadership choice and/or an unproductive
confrontation over the nature of the WTO at its outset.
You make a very critical point in how governments should make their choices
as to the WTO head - namely, that each candidate should be judged (among
other important criteria) on his ability to draw support beyond his natural
constituency. Thus, your point that Mr Renato Ruggiero - Italian former
trade minister and the EU's official candidate - should be judged, among
other criteria, on his support from such areas as Latin America and Asia.
His support now is largely from the EU and countries closely tied to it.
Similarly, it would follow that Mr Carlos Salinas, former Mexican president,
must draw significant support from countries outside the western hemisphere;
and that Mr Kim Chul-su, South Korea trade minister, should be more than an
Asian candidate.
Your approach is meritorious and should help select a candidate based on
ability. My own favourite, Mr Salinas, I would concede, must draw
significant support from such areas as Africa, the Asian sub-continent and
Australasia, rather than being solely a western hemisphere candidate. I
believe he can do so as, at least in my judgment, the best candidate for
this position at this time.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'Boost for Dublin's tax haven' (December 8), reporting
the decision of the European Commission to extend the marketing deadline for
Dublin's International Financial Services Centre, refers to the centre as a
'tax haven'.
Such pejorative language is totally inappropriate. The rate of corporation
tax on the profits of companies in the International Financial Services
Centre is 10 per cent exactly, the same rate applicable to the profits of
manufacturing companies in Ireland.
Some 220,000 people are employed in manufacturing industry in Ireland, of
whom some 90,000 are employees of foreign-owned industrial enterprises.
These companies are attracted by a favourable corporation tax regime and the
European Union's youngest and best educated workforce. The same features
attract companies to the centre.
Your correspondent should be aware that the European Commission is not in
the business of approving tax havens and that its decision vindicates how
the centre has evolved over the past seven years.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Swelling hubbub over Heathrow: Michael Skapinker analyses
the debate over plans for a fifth terminal at the UK airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Des Wilson, veteran campaigner for worthy causes, will this morning brave
the ire of environmentalists by presenting the case for a fifth terminal at
London's Heathrow airport.
Mr Wilson, who earlier this year became public affairs director of BAA, the
airports group that owns Heathrow, will be backing up Sir John Egan, BAA's
chief executive, and Sir Richard Rogers, the architect of the proposed
Pounds 900m terminal. They will unveil at a press conference the detailed
submission they intend to make to what is expected to be one of the biggest
public inquiries in the south-east of England.
The Department of the Environment says it has already received 5,000 letters
about the proposed terminal, 95 per cent of which are hostile. As many as
3,000 of the objectors intend to address the inquiry when it starts next
May.
The Airports Policy Consortium, representing 30 south of England local
authorities of all political persuasions, will argue that the terminal
should not be built. The objectors argue that Heathrow, which already
handles 51m passengers a year, cannot grow any further without inflicting
serious damage on the communities that live around it. The fifth terminal
would increase the airport's capacity to 80m.
Mr Dermot Cox, a committee member of the Heathrow Association for the
Control of Airport Noise, a pressure group, says: 'Terminal Five sounds like
just another terminal. It isn't. It's a whole new airport.'
Given the strength of feeling against the proposed terminal, BAA's
recruitment of the New Zealand-born Mr Wilson is a significant coup. The
former campaign director of the UK Liberal Democrats founded Shelter, which
champions the homeless, led the Campaign for Lead-Free Air, chaired the UK
branch of the Friends of the Earth and is the author of books such as
Pressure, the A to Z of Campaigning in Britain.
He says he is entirely comfortable in his new role. 'Very few major projects
involve as little environmental impact as this one,' he says.
The terminal will be built on land mostly occupied by a sludge works between
Heathrow's two main runways. Access to the terminal will be via a new
station connected to the London Underground network, the proposed Heathrow
Express rail link and a spur road from the M25 motorway. The M25 will not
have to be widened to accommodate the additional traffic, BAA says. With new
rail links, it adds, 45 per cent of travellers to and from Heathrow will use
public transport by 2016, compared with 36 per cent today.
BAA insists that there will be no increase in night flights if the new
terminal is built. Nor will the group need to build a third runway to handle
the increased air traffic. With a rise in the average number of passengers
per aircraft, BAA says Heathrow's two existing runways can handle the
increase in flights expected in future years.
The company says it needs the terminal to maintain Heathrow's position as
the world's leading international airport, which in turn underpins London's
position as one of the most important financial and business centres.
BAA expects passenger demand at Heathrow to grow by 3-4 per cent a year for
the foreseeable future. If Heathrow fails to accommodate this growing
demand, ambitious airports such as Frankfurt, Charles de Gaulle in Paris and
Amsterdam's Schiphol will do so instead.
The Airports Policy Consortium rejects these arguments. Miss Frances Rudd,
its planning officer, says: 'With or without Terminal Five, Heathrow is
still the world's leading international airport. I remain unconvinced that
if Heathrow doesn't get Terminal Five, London will decline.'
Instead of trying to accommodate ever-increasing demand on the congested
west side of London, the consortium believes BAA should be promoting
development to the east of the capital, which, it argues, is in line with
government policy for regenerating the East Thames corridor.
The consortium says that, instead of building Terminal Five, BAA should
promote the development of Stansted airport in Essex, which has good rail
links to the City of London. In contrast to the bustle at Heathrow, Stansted
appears eerily empty, with only 3.2m passengers a year.
For the anti-noise campaign, Mr Cox, a market researcher who has lived near
Heathrow since he was a child, says that he does not see how the airport can
operate the fifth terminal without a third runway.
The existing runways are already heavily utilised. According to Mr Cox,
BAA's argument that it can handle the additional traffic using just two
runways appears to be based on a firm conviction that larger aircraft will
be built over the next few years. 'Their case is that we are going to have
these super Jumbos taking 600 or 800 people. But they don't exist. People
are talking about it, but it is still very hazy,' he says.
Mr Cox says that, even with the current level of aircraft traffic, life is
difficult for those who live near Heathrow. He concedes that people who
choose to live near an international airport must expect a certain amount of
noise, but he argues that they should not have to suffer being woken at 4am
by overhead flights.
Mr Cox says walks in Kew Gardens, a favourite haunt of his, are ruined by
the sound of aircraft. 'Kew Gardens advertises itself as a haven of peace
and tranquillity. If I wasn't a friend of Kew Gardens, I would refer them to
the Advertising Standards Authority,' he says.
Mr Wilson counters that making greater use of Stansted or London's Gatwick
airport would not reduce the need for Terminal Five. Even if Stansted and
Gatwick were used to full capacity, there would still be excess demand from
airlines wanting to fly into London.
In any event, Mr Wilson argues, 30 per cent of Heathrow's passengers use the
airport to change to other aircraft. If these transfer passengers were
denied the use of Heathrow, many would not use Stansted. They would change
flights in Paris, Frankfurt or Amsterdam, he says.
However hard BAA markets Stansted or Gatwick, international air passengers
insist on using Heathrow. 'Heathrow has a choice of airlines, flights and
destinations unmatched anywhere in the world. We are simply reflecting what
the industry wants,' he says.
BAA also rejects the view that new, large aircraft are essential if Terminal
Five is to operate without a third runway. Aircraft using Heathrow currently
carry an average of 126 passengers each and use the two runways to 82 per
cent of their capacity. If by 2016, with Terminal Five built, the two
runways are used to 92 per cent of their capacity, aircraft will have to
carry 177 passengers per aircraft. A Boeing 747-400 already carries 400.
BAA says that the number of Heathrow neighbourhoods affected by noise has
been falling, because newer aircraft are quieter. In 1978, 1.5m people were
affected by high levels of noise. Today, the figure is 500,000. By 2016, the
figure will fall to 225,000 if Terminal Five is not built, and 293,000 if it
is.
Today Mr Wilson will present an opinion poll showing that over half the
residents near Heathrow support Terminal Five and that they are more worried
by traffic, litter and crime than by aircraft noise. He says: 'We will show
that 73 per cent of people within a 5-mile radius of Heathrow haven't been
woken once by aircraft noise in the past year.'
The anti-Terminal Five campaigners will no doubt point out that BAA's
figures mean that more than one in four people living near Heathrow have
been woken by low-flying aircraft over the past year.
Mr Wilson accepts that BAA's opponents have genuine concerns. In the end,
however, the government will have to make a choice based on the interests of
the UK and London, he says. 'It's a test of whether this country is capable
of taking long-term decisions or whether short-term responses to a minority
will prevail.'

FT  19 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unwise to lower ceiling of target
range for UK prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr PETER WESTAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'A new target for inflation' (December 13), suggested a
number of modifications to the framework for monetary policy relating in
particular to the inflation target. You rightly focus on the question of how
to acquire the credibility for this target which, judging by prevailing
interest rate expectations and most inflation forecasts, has not yet been
fully achieved.
Since the RPIX inflation rate is currently higher than that of the RPIY, I
cannot believe that a move to a target which is now easier to hit is likely
to enhance credibility, although eventually a move to the RPIY definition
may be sensible.
Given that many forecasts, including our own at the National Institute,
would have inflation rising above 3 per cent in the next two years, it would
seem unwise to advocate a lowering of the ceiling of the target range to 3
per cent.
Even if the central forecast for inflation were to remain below this level,
we live in an uncertain world where discretion needs to be the better part
of valour. The tighter the inflation target, the more likely it is that some
unexpected occurrence may cause the target range to be violated. Or even for
unacceptably high output costs to be paid to keep the target range intact.
In such circumstances, the actual Treasury-Bank strategy of 'talking down'
inflation into the lower half of the range while maintaining the original
range of 1-4 per cent may actually be rather prudent.
Importantly, as you emphasise, the question of any future administration's
commitment to an inflation target has a crucial bearing on the long-term
credibility of anti-inflationary policy and can even influence its current
effectiveness. There now seems to be cross-party agreement on the role of
monetary policy in achieving low inflation. One possible area of confusion
may arise, however, with the Labour party's stated intention to a target for
growth. If this means that monetary policy will be actively used to raise
gross domestic product above its 'natural level', then inflation can indeed
be expected to be higher. Alternatively, if the growth target means that
supply side policies will be adopted in an attempt to increase the long-run
growth rate endogenously, to use a much maligned but ultimately rather
important expression, then the effects on inflation are much less certain
and may even be beneficial.
I echo your call for clarity on all sides.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Motorway toll rationale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW J WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I agree that motorway tolls present a huge political problem for a
government (Personal View, December 14), but comparisons with motorway tolls
in France are invalid. Distances between French cities are such that
switching to non-toll roads could lengthen journey times by many hours, if
not days: in contrast, the use of motorways in principal French conurbations
is free of tolls: on that same model, use of the M25 would remain free.
The French do have a viable alternative to motorways: the TGV, which is
ideally suited to the long inter-city distances in France.
If the UK government were serious about the environment, it would use the
money raised in motorway tolls, fuel taxes, etc, to invest directly in an
advanced, non-car transport infrastructure designed to meet Britain's travel
needs of the 21st century. Any other rationale for introducing motorway
tolls would simply be another tax on people who need to get from A to B.

'La traviata' is hardly the kind of Christmas show you would expect from the
Komische Operand not just because of its tragic ending. Verdi has never been
much favoured by a company which places more emphasis on brilliant acting
than beautiful singing. Nevertheless, the production which opens on Thursday
has undeniable potential: Yakov Kreizberg conducts, Harry Kupfer produces
and Violetta is sung by the young Noemi Nadelmann.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Arts: 'Method' married to madness - Nigel Andrews talks to
Rod Steiger, who returns to the cinema after ten years in the wilderness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do you do if an unexploded bomb is lying about in your movie? Do you
defuse or detonate it? Or do you just rejoice that it is there? The
Specialist, opening on Boxing Day, is a Sylvester Stallone thriller full of
fake explosions and dummy showdowns: but it has one genuine exposed bomb in
its cast. The name is Rod Steiger. The 69-year-old Jewish-Irish actor is
back: ex-Oscar winner for In The Heat Of The Night, ex-sparring partner to
the great (Brando in On The Waterfront) and for decades the most articulate
spokesman for the postwar era's best-known acting tradition. The Method.
In The Specialist Steiger, marrying madness to Method, careers about the
screen with a gun and Cuban accent as if he had never been away. But for ten
years he was away, in a private hell of near-clinical depression. It was
caused in part by a faltering career and bad role choices. I met him
recently in Hollywood. Yachting cap on head, face round as a Gouda, voice
primed for that raspy singsong, he talked for two hours about acting; with a
passion and breadth I have never met in any other practitioner.
Steiger accepts that he is no longer first choice for top character roles in
modern Hollywood. 'Every time I see something I like,' he snarls, 'I run
into Sean Connery or Gene Hackman.' But he is still mildly shocked when he
encounters executives who demand an interview before casting him.
'They've never heard of me. Some of your executives today are 30 years old,
what the hell do they remember of me? You just have to go in and swallow
your pride. I figure if Brando could do a screen test for Godfather -
smartest move he ever made - I can do auditions too.'
False pride he has given up. He vanished into his black hole, compounded of
drink, divorce pains and career depression, soon after making what he thinks
was his worst ever career judgment: turning down the lead role in Patton.
'I woke up one morning and I was young and vibrant and alive and my
philosophies were strong, and I said I'm a pacifist] I'll have nothing to do
with this man. Biggest mistake of my life. If I'd been successful in that
part, and it won George C. Scott an Oscar, I might even have had a shot at
the Godfather.'
Instead the Steiger glory days are the 1950s and '60s, when in the era
before Hoffman or De Niro he was a one-man phenomenon: a character actor
with the power and presence to push into stardom.
Steiger thinks he never pushed quite that far. 'I was never a leading man. I
missed that one pre-requisite for real stardom, I never was what they call a
'sex symbol'. If you don't get the female following of a tribe, you don't
get that big as an actor. Brando had it. James Dean. Nicholson even has it -
the attractiveness of evil.'
So he settled for the rollercoasting life of a high-exposure character
player. There was joy here, from 'the freedom of being other people'. And
there was fear too: the energising anxiety that comes from ever-changing
challenges on stage and screen.
'Fear motivates an actor,' says Steiger. ''I'm gonna try to be good in this
part,' you say, and you don't care who is watching, you have to entertain
them. If I was in a room with just an automatic camera, and lighting, and no
human beings, and there was just the studio cat, I'd worry about how the cat
was reacting. Or a cockroach. 'Did the cockroach look at me? Did I entertain
him?'
'But there's a price to pay for living with the childhood romantic dream of
having adventure and challenge. After a while you don't have so many
'highs', because you don't get employed that quickly any more. And then you
watch out because boredom comes in and you're looking frantically for
something to give that fear again, because you misinterpret that fear as
being alive.'
Glamour, not terror, lured him into acting. 'I came from a neighbourhood in
Newark, New Jersey, where if you put the garbage out and helped with the
dishes your mother gave you fifteen cents and you went to the movies on
Saturday afternoon and watched the golden people.'
Steiger's voice rises and stretches on that 'g-o-l-d-e-n' He knows, even off
camera, where the oomph should come in a sentence. When he joined the golden
people himself, enrolling in the Actors Studio, then going on stage and TV
to hew his reputation as a powerhouse Everyman, Steiger became famous for
pushing and pulling his scripts. Not just accents and emphases but whole
words and phrases.
'What are sentences?,' he says. 'They're prismatic particles, flying out
from the centre of a thought. And you catch the flashing of their individual
light and you understand that sentence. So you fool around with it a little,
so long as you keep the meaning.'
He and Brando did so in the famous taxi scene in On The Waterfront ('I
coulda been a contender, Charlie'). The scene was born, recalls Steiger,
from an accumulation of happy mishaps.
'We spent eleven hours shooting. The producer Sam Spiegel had promised us
back-projection. When Kazan the director arrived, there was no street
footage to project behind the cab's window]
'Well, a crew member said he'd come in that day in a taxi with venetian
blinds. So Kazan used that. And we were in that tight space - half a mock-up
cab - and Kazan brought the camera right in on our faces. We played that
scene, and played with it, till it came right.'
Waterfront was a watershed in postwar acting: the vindication of the Method
in popular cinema. Did Steiger sense this at the time?
'You never know you're doing a revolution,' he says. 'If you do, you're a
pain in the ass. You cannot make love and criticise your performance at the
same time.
'Let me tell you about the 'Method.' The word was invented by journalists to
describe the ideas that Lee Strasberg and Stella Adler brought back from a
visit to Russia. In the old style of acting you used conjecture to force an
emotion in from outside. With the Method the actor uses involvement to
discover the emotions in himself.
'So you find something in your own life. If somebody tells me my daughter's
died, I cry.' Tears come into Steiger's eyes on cue. (His daughter and only
child is the opera singer Anna Steiger.) 'But I'm afraid of using that too
much, in case I use it up. Another time, I'll use something like I did in
The Big Knife. I had to get angry in one scene, so I looked at the set and I
had just seen - this was after the war - photos of Auschwitz and Treblinka.
So I said to myself, 'These people built this place]' And that did it for
me.' Steiger exploded on cue. Look at the movie today and take shelter.
But the Method has room for more lightweight techniques too. 'The famous
American actress Shirley Booth was rehearsing a scene on stage where she
puts provisions she's bought into the fridge. And the director said,
'Shirley darling] We can't take this long]' So she came in again and did the
scene in a fifth of the time, without hurrying. He asked how she did it. 'Oh
I have a taxi outside with the meter running,' she said.'
Occasionally the actor finds he has no techniques at all to hand. For The
Pawnbroker Steiger had to 'invent' a moment while the camera was running.
'For the scene where I put my hand down on the spindle and the spike goes
through, I had done a lot of rehearsal at home. But midway through the shot
I thought to myself, 'You son of a bitch. You forgot to practice taking the
hand off]' So I couldn't embarrass myself by stopping the camera. I just
remembered what I did whenever I panicked, which was to hold my breath, and
I took a deep lungful of air and then - phooh] - let it out.'
Steiger's greatest early roles were plain men yanked into extremity. But in
the late 1960s his career took a startling turn. He began behaving like a
one-man Madame Tussauds. Pope John XXIII, Mussolini, Rasputin, WC Fields.
Real historical figures, topped off by Napoleon in Waterloo.
'Oh that's a high]' he rhapsodises. 'If I could live for one tenth of a
second at the exciting level of a great moment in history, because I somehow
made myself believe it was happening to me, why not go for it?'
So he bookwormed through the reference tomes. He had Napoleon's autopsy
translated into English; he discovered that the man was riddled with
diseases and drugs; he invented a scenario for the Waterloo defeat. 'I
believe on the night before the battle he bombed himself out on laudanum.'
The only thing Steiger refused to do was put his arm inside his coat. Not
even for a publicity shot.
'What's a cliche? It's a given truth that's repeated so often that it
becomes a bore, a joke. What makes a king or an emperor isn't gestures or
royal vowel sounds - 'Men of Fraahnce]' The man may stammer; he may have a
high lisping voice. What makes a king is that when he says he is thirsty,
fifty people come bringing water]'
And what makes an actor, I ask; knowing the clock is ticking towards a
football match Steiger wants to watch on television.
'We're all of us actors. We act all day long. We act when we say no and we
mean yes. We act when we say yes and we mean no. We act trying to seduce a
woman. Acting belongs to everyone on earth.
'Why do we do it professionally? People ask me that. You put yourself under
the microscope of the world; there must be something wrong with you. Well, I
know why I do it.' (pause) 'Because I want respect.' (Hint of red again in
the eyes). 'For me. For my family.'
He lets the words sink into the silence.
'And now get out. (goodhumouredly). I'm turning the TV on] Goodbye]'

FT  19 DEC 94 / Arts: Sleeping Beauty - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH HEMMING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A good pantomine, like a good Christmas dinner, is a tricky thing to pull
off. First you have your list of ingredients: good dame, hissable baddie,
plenty of slapstick, running gags, a songsheet, a chase sequence, a fight,
songs, plenty of glitter, a sprinkling of topicality, a pinch of blue
(optional) and a pinch of camp (not optional), and those little plums that
have to pop out - 'he's behind you', 'oh yes you will'.
Then you must mix your ingredients well, in the certain knowledge that if
one thing is missing, it will be the one thing that everybody notices. Even
then, when everything is compiled, it might not work out: a little
overcooked, a little undercooked, and the whole thing misfires.
The Theatre Royal, Stratford East usually serves up an excellent panto. Sad
to relate, then, that The Sleeping Beauty, this year's offering, seems
rather underdone. Most of the ingredients are there, and David Cregan's
script treads that difficult line between providing a proper story for the
children and working in the traditional pantomine elements. The audience
participation is beautifully managed in Philip Hedley's production; there is
some nice topicality - the King and Queen are 1990s parents ('but what will
people say if I don't bring her up myself,' wails the Queen, as a nanny is
hired for the baby Beauty) - and the show is governed by an enjoyable dame
in the shape of Michael Bertenshaw as a stout, stern, hatchet-faced
nursemaid.
But the struggle between good and evil is underplayed: the trio of fairy
godmothers is not very funny and the evil fairy appears too seldom to get
the hissing up to full steam. The characterisation is a bit vague: the Queen
and the King are both silly ninnies, while the Archbishop and Crispin,
Princess Rose's little playmate, have no characters at all to speak of. The
songs are rather wishy-washy - with the exception of 'Don't Be Brave', an
excellent little number rubbishing fairytale heroics - and there are a
couple of scenes that should have been left off the list of ingredients
altogether: a dream sequence and an overlong preamble for the second act.
Take those away, add a bit more spice, slapstick and sheer sillyness, and
the show might reach its comic potential.
We all know where the proof of the pudding lies, of course, and, to be fair,
the children in the audience enjoyed it. But I departed feeling rather
undernourished; frustrating, since this is a theatre that you so often leave
fascinated, with your sides aching from over-indulgence.
At Theatre Royal, Stratford East to January 28 (081-534-0310).

Like many winning formulas, Picture This (10pm BBC2) is so simple you wonder
why nobody thought of it before. Prompted by a miner's disdainful remark
(nemesis later strikes) about lavatory-cleaning, the programme constructs a
chain (no pun intended) of apparently undesirable jobs, throwing up much
professional pride and personal integrity. The toilet cleaner in turn would
never stoop to prostitution - cue a prostitute (Central Casting stuff, this:
a dominatrix with all the gear) who whips her punters but hates cruelty to
animals: cue a sympathetic abattoir-worker, and so on. The absence of
television critics from this display of fragile dignity makes a curious
omission.
The stale flavour of cliche permeates Milner (9.30 BBC1): the seedy
investigative lawyer with marriage problems, snooty colleagues, seeming
inadequacy - the formulaic anti-hero, in fact. Mel Smith tries to make it as
a straight actor, amiable but not really convincing, supported by an
unexciting cast of decent second-raters.

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Japan, the transfer of ageing bureaucrats to the private sector is so
common that there is a term for it, amakudari, descent from heaven, writes
Ian Rodger. In Switzerland, it is less frequent, but it is becoming
fashionable among diplomats, for whom there is less call than in cold war
days when the services of a trustworthy neutral country were in great
demand.
Last week, Erwin Schurtenberger, 55, the current ambassador to China, jumped
to Ciba-Geigy as head of the pharmaceuticals and chemicals group's year-old
Chinese subsidiary. Schurtenberger follows the example set by David de Pury,
the country's former official responsible for world trade matters, who moved
to ABB Asea Brown Boveri in 1991; he is now co-chairman.
Bernhard Stettler, former counsellor at the Swiss mission to the Council of
Europe in Strasbourg, has become spokesman for Swiss Bank Corporation, and
Philippe Levy, a former trade official with ambassador status, who ran the
Basle International Fair for a few years until last December, has now become
an adviser to the Geneva-based international inspection and product testing
group, Societe Generale de Surveillance.
Switzerland has no tradition of a reverse movement so eyebrows have been
raised over the nomination of Ueli Sigg, 48, a former executive and member
of one of the controlling families of the Schindler elevators group, as
Schurtenberger's successor in Peking.
But at least Sigg has undisputed qualifications for the job. In 1980, on
behalf of Schindler, he negotiated the first ever joint venture in China for
a western company.
Old diplomatic hands are less amused by the appointment of Gret Haller,
speaker of the lower house of the federal parliament, as ambassador to the
council of Europe in Strasbourg. They call her derisively a 'quer
einsteiger', someone who climbs aboard crosswise.

FT  19 DEC 94 / People (Names in the News): Dream time for Montgomery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Michael Montgomery ended his eight-year career with Walt Disney by
resigning as finance director of Euro Disney, its troubled French
subsidiary, the last thing on his mind was to take another job in
entertainment, writes Alice Rawsthorn.
Now, four months later, he is back in the same business after joining forces
with the 'dream team' - Jeffrey Katzenberg, former head of Disney's movie
studios, Steven Spielberg, director of Jurassic Park and Schindler's List,
and David Geffen, the billionaire music mogul - in their attempt to launch a
new entertainment group.
'It was not what I expected to do,' says Montgomery, 40, whose top priority
in his new job will be to raise capital. 'But this was an opportunity I
couldn't resist. It's one of the most exciting new ventures that anyone
could dream of.'
Katzenberg was the architect of his appointment. The two had worked together
on film-financing projects at Disney where Montgomery was assistant
treasurer from 1986 to 1991 and then treasurer until he moved to Euro Disney
in 1993.
He will be working closely with Katzenberg and with Ronald Nelson, former
finance director of the Paramount entertainment group. Yet Montgomery
insists that there will be no conflict of interest between his role and
Nelson's. 'There is so much work to do here - plenty for everyone. Besides,
I can't think of a nicer guy to work with.'
After four months of self-indulgence - 'doing all the things I haven't had
time for in 15 years, like taking my son to school and improving my golf' -
he is now preparing for a more rigorous regime at the temporary offices in
Los Angeles.
Rigorous it may be, but raising capital for the star-studded team and Geffen
sounds much more enjoyable than struggling to salvage Euro Disney. 'It'll be
hard work,' he says. 'But I can't think of any job which will be more fun.'

FT  19 DEC 94 / People (Names in the News): Questrom's US shopping trip
completed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It looks as though Allen Questrom, chairman and chief executive of Federated
Department Stores, has finally done it, writes Richard Tomkins. Today,
barring last-minute obstacles, the US department store chain will complete
its takeover of the rival RH Macy retailing group, and Questrom will become
the department store king of the US.
His empire will embrace 347 department stores trading under some of the best
known names in US retailing. Federated's 11 chains will include
Bloomingdale's, Macy's, A&amp;S, Bon Marche and Burdines. Questrom will be
chairman and chief executive of a group with annual revenues of Dollars
13.5bn.
For Questrom, 54, it will be the crowning moment of his career. A native of
Massachusetts, he joined Federated as a trainee at A&amp;S after graduating from
Boston University, and quickly rose to the position of merchandise manager.
By January 1988, he had become vice chairman of Federated itself - but four
months later he stormed out to join the Neiman-Marcus department store group
when Federated was taken over by Canadian financier Robert Campeau.
As it turned out, his absence was only temporary. When Campeau drove
Federated into bankruptcy in 1990, Questrom was wooed back to pull the
company out of its troubles. Then, just as he had turned Federated round, RH
Macy found itself going into bankruptcy, and Questrom started making
overtures.
Federated eventually won control of RH Macy by buying some of its debt from
another creditor, so securing a powerful say in the company's future. Now
Questrom faces the formidable task of showing that he can make the merger
work. Many a successful executive has come unstuck on less; but most US
retailers would say that if anyone can do it, Questrom can.

FT  19 DEC 94 / People: The catalyst for new year resolutions at Hoechst -
Jurgen Dormann is bringing about radical changes at the world's biggest
chemicals group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to German corporate tradition, Jurgen Dormann had one crucial
qualification for his elevation last May to chairmanship of Hoechst: more
than 30 years' unbroken, faithful service. By another traditional measure,
he is not qualified at all: he is not a chemist. But the 54-year-old former
finance director - the first non-technical man to run the show - shows no
signs of suffering any deficiencies as a result.
Dormann himself suggests that it is partly because he has been around so
long that the most radical shake-out yet seen in Germany's much-restructured
chemicals sector has so far been the success it has. Hoechst's staff do not
see him as an 'occupying force', he says, and he is thus accorded more
accolades than resistance.
His colleagues, meanwhile, laud him for not succumbing to the paralysing
conservatism and aversion to risk which routinely characterise many
long-serving German managers. 'Paranoia is a thing of the past,' says one.
So, too, is the old hierarchical muddle which used to typify the structure
of the world's biggest chemicals group and fourth biggest pharmaceuticals
company. On January 1, everything will be turned inside out - officially.
The number of operating divisions will be cut from 15 to seven. Clearly
separate stand-alone operations will be run as such. Responsibility,
exercised centrally for decades, will be distributed. Rewards will be
commensurate with performance. The management board will give up a seat to
its first foreigner, an American. Questions from the public and press will
be answered. And concerns from the population about the chemicals and drugs
industries - particularly in Germany - will be addressed in an accessible
fashion.
Dormann, a skinny, nervous-looking Hessian, has earned much popular credit
for instituting all this change. But the reality appears to be that he is
what is known in other business cultures as an enabler. His assumption of
power in the wake of the unlamented Wolfgang Hilger, a dour man with little
appreciation of the merits of communication, has simply released reserves of
talent which had been bottled up.
Dormann scoffs at any suggestion that outside business consultants have had
a hand in his scheme. All the changes and new ideas came from an eight-man
team of senior managers called together four weeks before he took control
and set seriously to work on the day he moved offices in May. Their
proposals were ready by the end of September and approved by the board in
early October.
All were promoted, and several put in charge of the projects they proposed -
a tactic which seems to appeal to Dormann's sense of humour. 'They have to
live up to their ideas . . .I told them at the beginning I was not asking
them to come in, prepare an analysis and then go off again like other
consultants.'
Further down the line, he admits, 'it's hard to convince people that they
have to get more business- and market- oriented, that they have a
bottom-line responsibility, and that they will be paid based on the goals we
agree on.'
But he insists there has been little resistance to change. Indeed, the works
and middle management appear to be suffused with a sense of relief - if not
excitement - that the old order has been swept away so comprehensively.
'Even though there are a lot of familiar faces still in the top management,
there is a feeling that they have seriously changed their way of looking at
and doing things,' says one senior manager.
Part of the relief stems from a conviction that it is now inconceivable that
the management is capable of repeating the blunders accompanying last year's
series of accidents at the group's main site near Frankfurt, when Hoechst's
response - dismissiveness, followed by panic  - showed it as disorganised,
defensive and arrogant.
Dormann is none of these. An industrialist with political skills, he can be
engagingly informal but visibly weighs his words before speaking. 'We are
not hiding any longer,' he says. 'The main message is that we want to manage
our activities based on long-term goals and vision.'
Much of the propaganda drive is addressed to German environmental concerns,
he acknowledges. It is one of the few areas in which he is prepared to say
that domestic issues play a strong part in strategic thinking. Perhaps this
is not surprising, given that the company has built its last large-scale
chemicals plant in Germany. There is more than enough capacity; the issue is
one of managing a reduction in size.
Dormann is not afraid to move capacity and even headquarters functions out
of the country. The fibres division, one of four core business areas he has
identified, is now being run from the US with an American in charge. 'It's
not a question of passports or nationalities; it's a question of competence,
markets, technology and creativity,' he says.
For example, the logical sites for manufacturing chemicals for use in the
electronics industry are in Japan rather than Germany, he says.
Top priority is now overseas growth: in north America, eastern Europe -
above all, in Asia. Just returned from a visit to China, Dormann knew 'that
1.2bn people live there. But seeing it makes the difference. My God, what a
lot of tasks we face. We are negotiating four or five joint ventures in the
industrial gas business. We might be a little late, but China is such a huge
market.'
In the US, he would like to add maybe two or three mid-sized pharmaceuticals
acquisitions to the existing north American drugs operations - recently
bolstered by a minority stake in Copley Pharmaceutical, which specialises in
generic products. Since Hoechst took the stake, Copley has been hit by a
series of problems including the recall of faulty products.
Perhaps surprisingly, Dormann admits that he is not altogether clear what
has happened. But then it may be the sort of admission which an 'enabling'
executive chairman must be prepared to make, especially in the early stages,
if he is properly committed to delegation. 'It's our job here to see the
links (between our companies). We try to involve our divisional people in
strategy discussion but not in the details of cost-cutting,' he says. The
new corporate formation will, he hopes, act as an early warning system.
But the changes go far deeper than structure, he says. 'We have changed the
mood.'

FT  19 DEC 94 / Media Futures: Businesses warned over lax security on
Internet - How secure is the network?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN MCGOOKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When General Electric of the US admitted recently that computer hackers had
gained access to sensitive company material via the Internet, it raised
fears among businesses about the confidentiality of their dealings on the
rapidly-expanding worldwide computer network.
'Many people believe the Internet offers them all the security of a royal
telephone call,' says Gerry O'Neill of Britain's National Computing Centre
in Manchester, speaking ironically.
He estimates that around 60 per cent of all traffic on the Internet is of
commercial origin, based on message exchanges using the . co suffix, which
identifies business users. 'Security practices which are required for an
internal network with a few thousand users simply do not guarantee secure
links to an Internet community of 35m people,' he says.
The responsibility rests with companies to establish their security
properly. But there are indications that some of the 25,000 or so companies
worldwide thought to be using the Internet commercially may not be taking
security as seriously as the risks warrant, or that they do not regard their
data as particularly sensitive.
A survey in the US last month by Ernst &amp; Young and Information Week magazine
quizzed more than 1,250 various-sized companies. More than half admitted
suffering some kind of loss due to computer security problems, but 34 per
cent of respondents said their senior management saw information security as
only somewhat important, and 8 per cent - around 100 companies - said the
issue was viewed as not important at all.
Dr Brian Neale, a UK-based specialist on Internet security with US computer
company Digital Equipment, points out that once a system's security has been
breached, its advantages are lost to legitimate users until the problem is
solved. Even if the loss is only for a few hours, the cost can be high. GE's
system was off the Net for about a week.
'The scramble among businesses not to be left behind by the Internet
revolution has meant that the normally high security standards found among
large IT users are not mirrored in their policies towards the Internet,' Dr
Neale says. He estimates that three-quarters of large firms currently using,
or intending to use, the Internet fall into this category and are
under-protected, making them 'dangerous drivers on the information
superhighway'. In a study called Secure Connections to the Internet, Neale
outlines the need for effective security procedures - known as firewalls. In
effect, these are 'gateway' computers which distinguish authorised access
from unauthorised. 'The aim of the Digital firewall is to allow employees to
gain access to Internet services in as near-transparent fashion as possible,
while preventing access of unauthorised external users,' he says.
Britain's Department of Trade and Industry has a permanent team working on
policy for IT security. With several leading companies, including BT,
Unilever, Midland Bank and Nationwide Building Society, the team has
produced a code of practice advising information security managers how to
establish and develop a secure information strategy.
But a big part of the security problem as it specifically relates to the
Internet is that there is no visible regulator or any overall authority that
formally polices those who use the system.
Fundamental legal requirements are laid down by the 1984 Data Protection
Act, one of the principles of which states that 'appropriate security
measures shall be taken against unauthorised access to or alteration,
disclosure or destruction of personal data and against accidental loss or
destruction of personal data.'
While the 1990 Computer Misuse Act does not impose any statutory
requirements on businesses, its aim is to deter unauthorised access to, and
modification of, information held on computers.
It created three offences: acting with intent to gain unauthorised access to
programs or data held on computer; unauthorised access with intent to commit
or facilitate commission of more serious offences; and unauthorised
modification of the contents of a computer.
The DTI believes companies should promote awareness of these offences as
part of their computer security policies, in addition to taking steps to
reduce the risk of offences being perpetrated on their computer systems.
As became clear from the GE breach, even the existence of sophisticated
firewalls does not deter dedicated hackers. What is obvious, however, is
that as the nature of on-line commerce evolves, companies will be forced to
reassess their computer security provisions almost continually.

Internet, can be contacted at brian. neale@sbp. mts. dec. com or through the

FT  19 DEC 94 / Media Futures: New-age Britannica gets foot in the door -
Martin Mulligan explains how the encyclopaedia company is meeting the
challenge of new technologies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN MULLIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
He is etched in urban legend: the smiling yet implacable doorstep salesman
of encyclopaedias. You might think him a member of a threatened profession,
trading on borrowed time in an increasingly high-tech, information-rich
world. But you would be mistaken. If the leaders in the field are to be
trusted, the future of the doorstep encyclopaedia salesman is assured. In
fact, his prospects have never seemed more alluring.
Which is strange. After all, aren't books themselves said to be living on
borrowed time, perhaps already superseded by CD-Rom, interactive and
multimedia products?
Joseph J Esposito, north American president of Encyclopaedia Britannica,
sees things differently.
At ease in his book-lined office, a short walk beyond the stone lions that
guard Chicago's Art Institute, Esposito describes himself as 'an English
professor manque'. He combines a keen sense of mission with an eye for what
is really happening in the global information market.
A self-confessed bookaholic, Esposito quotes T S Eliot and Voltaire in the
same breath as he outlines the cyclical pattern of sales since Encyclopaedia
Britannica, now in its 15th edition, was founded by three Scots in Edinburgh
in 1768.
His mission is that of self-appointed protector of particular values. 'As
long as the Enlightenment spirit exists in the world, there will be a
Britannica,' he declares. Stuffy he is not.
Today's Britannica comes in four 'flavours'. There is the printed version we
all know and love, Britannica CD-Rom, and, most recently, Britannica Online,
in a local area network version and a World Wide Web version. The latter two
are available at present only to universities and colleges (the first UK
institutions have bought licences very recently).
Britannica is making big efforts to enable libraries, schools, companies and
home users to gain access to its World Wide Web version. It does not know
how quickly that is likely to happen, but even within Chicago's bastion of
enlightenment, the Internet is seen as holding the most exciting
possibilities. Today's flood of information, Esposito argues, has made
Britannica, in all its forms, more valuable than ever. An environment in
which the questions have multiplied is tremendous news for a man in the
business of giving answers.
But the issues run much deeper. More than ever before, knowledge is
endangered by wave upon wave of information. A knowledgeable person is now
one who understands just how much of this information can be ignored.
What that person needs is a versatile, navigable, intellectual ark to carry
the inquiring mind from place to place on the back of the flood. And the
various versions of Britannica are just such arks.
As Esposito has said: 'What is essential for the future of knowledge is
filters and classifiers, information tools that cut out the noise and give
us pieces of the universe in knowable units.'
All well and good. But how does that square with the 32-volume, hand-tooled,
leather-bound monolith on the bookshelf - that alternative universe of print
and colour plates in which an imaginative child could lose itself for hours.
Has that special experience gone for ever, replaced for today's and
subsequent generations by CD-Rom or on-line versions of Britannica?
Perhaps not. Globally there is little hard evidence that sales of electronic
products are at the expense of book sales. There may even be a small
positive impact on book sales. Britannica's experience to date tends to
support this. Its traditional printed version still comes in seven different
bindings - to match room decorations.
'Most people buy the CD-Rom and print versions together, making up fully 40
per cent of our sales. Virtually no-one is buying CD-Rom without the print
version,' says Esposito.
It may be, after all, that print and electronic media do not have to fight
each other. Against all expectations, they may be able to enjoy a symbiotic
relationship.
CD-Rom is an 'interim technology', according to Esposito and his colleagues.
But nobody can say how long the interim will last. The single-disc
Britannica CD contains a dictionary, a thesaurus, and the 65,000 articles
and 44m words of the traditional Britannica. But they are the right words,
as distinct from mere information.
Britannica CD is described as fully interactive but not multimedia. It is
claimed to be the most interactive encyclopaedia going, because it has the
'best search engine on the market'.
A typical encyclopaedia contains 7m to 10m words. At 44m, Britannica is thus
the big boy on the block. Its competitors in print include Collier, Grolier
and World Books, but it says that its market share in print in the last few
years has grown. Esposito nominates Grolier and Microsoft as its most
successful electronic competitors.
Its strategy has been to invest in continually updating its database and
developing powerful search-and-retrieval functions, rather than adding the
random snippets of sound and video that characterise most CD-Rom
encyclopaedias. Esposito admits that only 10 per cent of the print version's
illustrations have translated into the CD-Rom format.
Could it be that Britannica's interest in CD-Rom is fuelled by the gnawing
suspicion that many of its prospective younger readers are losing themselves
in the branching networks of, say, Compton's Interactive Encyclopedia, a
screen-based 'reading experience' which is perhaps as memorable and exciting
for today's school-age children as their parents' first encounter with the
traditional Britannica?
Esposito praises the competition, then quietly observes that 'it is probably
unfortunate that Britannica and its competitors share the name of
encyclopaedia.'
It is a harsh fact of life that quality publishers tend to lose money. Is
Britannica defying that trend? Esposito does not evade the question, but his
reply is carefully constructed. Britannica is owned by the William Benton
Foundation, a non-profit corporation in Illinois, founded by the former
senator which supports the University of Chicago.
'Historically,' says Esposito, 'we are in a very cyclical business, and this
has been true of (our) US sales for the entire century. We felt the 1991
recession. In terms of total company revenue, lately international has been
greater than domestic. But the economy has begun to turn, and there is a
great sense of optimism.' He is aware that 'complacency kills companies, and
the future does not necessarily belong to us', but takes heart from the fact
that 'the more affluent consumer market is showing a preference for our
product.'
But what of Britannica Online, the jewel in the crown if the word of
information scientists is to be accepted? How does it differ from the
printed Britannica? Esposito reckons that 'a truly electronic encyclopaedia
will no more resemble a print encyclopaedia than a horseless carriage
resembles a horse.'
Britannica Online certainly offers a hint of what that might mean. In
addition to the 44m-word database, it carries celebrated articles from past
editions, new articles not included in the printed Britannica, essential
graphics and illustrations, and - crucially - references to other Internet
resources that can be easily accessed by clicking on an icon.
That last feature is pivotal. By clicking on 'hotlinks' within articles,
users can access, for example, the Soviet Archives Exhibition provided by
the Library of Congress or the Art and Culture of Mexico exhibition at the
University of Guadalajara. Here is a real hint of how an Internet
encyclopaedia may soon form a gateway to the world's knowledge.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Media Futures: Demos calls for regulator for communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A new regulator
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OfCom - responsible for all telecommunications and broadcasting networks is
one of the core proposals in a newly-published analysis of the social and
political implications of information technology. It comes from Demos, a
radical think-tank, whose advisory council includes John Ashworth, director
of the London School of Economics, and Martin Taylor, chief executive of
Barclays Bank.
Its views are expressed in a series of articles published both on paper and
on the Internet. Geoff Mulgan, its director, says in an introductory essay
that regulatory structures in UK communications have become too complex, and
that the regulation of networks should be consolidated into an Office of
Communications: 'The core of OfCom should take the form of a commission,
with open recruitment and hearings before a select committee on the
membership and chair,' he writes.
Its primary goal should be the achievement of satisfaction, or welfare,
among the public, he says, with competition as a means, not an end. He
advocates a separate regulator responsible for taste and content in the
cinema, press, television and video worlds.
Martin Cave, professor of economics at Brunel University and a special
adviser to Britain's existing telecommunications regulator, raises questions
in a further essay about the way a combined regulator might operate: 'The
key lies in the recognition that communication services involve a series of
stages, beginning with creation of the message, in some cases involving a
bundling or wholesale function and culminating in delivery to final
consumers. The regulator should seek to examine the degree of dominance at
any stage in the process, and in the case of bottlenecks for essential
facilities, mandate access, institute price control arrangements or take
alternative actions.'

FT  19 DEC 94 / Media Futures: Rapid growth for voicemail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Love it or loath it, voicemail, the business equivalent of the domestic
telephone answering machine, is here to stay.
According to Dataquest, the marketing consultancy, the UK market alone for
voicemail and voicemail products was worth Dollars 163.1m in 1993, a growth
rate of approximately 55 per cent in one year.
A recent survey carried out for Octel Communications, a designer and
manufacturer of voicemail products, suggests that some 38 per cent of the
UK's larger companies now have voice processing systems installed, with
manufacturing industry the most enthusiastic.
Financial services companies, however, seem the most satisfied, with almost
three-quarters of those surveyed reporting improved customer service.
Management, however, tended to be unenthusiastic about voicemail until after
installation. 'Initial resistance,' the survey said, 'seems to be linked
with a sense that the company may be losing its human face.' Indeed, a major
disadvantage detected was that some staff hide behind voicemail either to
avoid answering calls or to camouflage absence.
The principal errors that management makes in installing new technology  -
failure to train staff adequately, or to measure response - were very
evident in voicemail. Michael Persky, Octel's marketing director, said:
'Only 59 per cent of companies installing voicemail make training for users
compulsory. This should be 100 per cent if organisations are to maximise
their investment.'
Can it be only a matter of time before European companies follow the lead of
their US contemporaries and appoint 'voicemail police' to check that
colleagues are changing their greetings regularly and listening to their
mail?

FT  19 DEC 94 / Business Travel: The glories of the Khmers - An hour to
spare / Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You are in Paris, with an hour between meetings. What to do?
The suburb of Passy seems a long way from Phnom Penh. But here, safely
preserved in the Musee Guimet, is the greatest collection of Khmer sculpture
outside Cambodia - and one of the least trumpeted art treasures of Paris.
The Musee Guimet holds a kind of cultural litmus paper up to France's far
eastern colonial past, but its glories are the outstanding Khmer carvings,
displayed in just three ground-floor galleries.
The Khmers seem to have originated in southern India and to have imported
and adapted their native religion and culture, establishing themselves
during the ninth century as the dominant power in Indo-China for half a
millennium. Their legacy is a complex of temples encompassing five centuries
and some 75 square miles.
While Angkor Wat, the funerary monument, holds its head high beside the
great Gothic cathedrals of northern Europe, the sculpture of Chartres pales
beside the bas-reliefs and free-standing sculpture of Angkor.
An exquisite red sandstone lintel from Banteay Srei, carved with scenes from
The Ramayana, illustrates the vigour and originality of the Khmer artists,
even in the 10th century. A glorious horse-headed deity is a version of
Vishnu, the stone of his torso and head polished to a satin silvery grey.
All around, benign deities cast enchant-ing enigmatic smiles and voluptuous
asparas (dancing girls) leap gracefully in bas-relief.
Theatrically spotlit in an inner sanctum is the sculpture in the style of
the Bayon, the temple built by Jayavarman VII (1181-1201). Jayavarman, a
late convert to Buddhism, believed himself the Buddha incarnate, and his
image smiles down from the victory gateway and the 54 peaks of the bayon.
The Guimet has a head of this serene god-king. It is a work of enormous
subtlety and beauty.
If you have time for nothing else, this is the place to stop.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Business Travel: Peace dividend
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Jordanian Airline says it hopes peace with Israel will produce a surge
of traffic next year to restore its financial health. The airline is
expecting to record a loss this year, says Nader Dahabi, its president,
though he hopes that Middle East peace-making will help boost revenues after
years of decline.
He said that Royal Jordanian was co-operating with Israel's El Al to 'share
a new market on commercial lines which will be beneficial for the two
sides'. The peace process held out hopes of more traffic, especially from
north America and Europe, Dahabi said. A draft Jordanian-Israeli civil
aviation treaty will be signed soon.

Business visitors to China may ponder its death and accident rates for road
travel. More than 6,000 people were killed on the roads in China last month,
the National Public Transportation Security Department said. This was a rise
of 10.1 per cent on November last year, the department added in a report
carried by the Xinhua news agency yesterday.
Road accidents rose 3.7 per cent to 23,096; 12,480 people were injured, up
2.8 per cent.

Florence inaugurated its new Amerigo Vespucci air terminal, named after the
Florentine explorer, on Saturday, writes Andrew Hill in Milan.
The opening raised the competitive stakes with Pisa's airport which, though
90km away, is the traditional arrival point for Florence's tourists because
of its long runway.
Florence airport is already served by small jets operated from the UK,
France and Germany by carriers including Meridiana, UK Air and Lufthansa. It
claims to be the third largest airport in Italy, judged by number of
destinations served by scheduled airlines.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Business Travel: US air safety
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Air travel in the US over Christmas could be severely disrupted following
the grounding of dozens of commerical flights because of a crackdown on
commuter airline safety standards. At the weekend American Eagle suspended
all commuter operations to mid-west cities for the second time in less than
a week, and Kiwi International Airlines suspended all services.
Crashes have given US aviation its worst safety record in six years, with
the pall over the commuter airline industry deepened by two American Eagle
crashes in five weeks that killed 83 people. The result is that some
travellers have been scrambling for rental cars rather than short-hop
flights.
Prompted by last week's crash of an American Eagle UK-built Jetstream Super
31 (a two-engined turbo-prop), US transportation secretary Federico Pena
said that commuter airlines in the US faced more safety inspections and
their crews would get more rest under new safety rules.
He said American Eagle has been observing the safety standards required for
larger aircraft, but that the authorities would start an immediate safety
audit of every US carrier, large or small. In addition, commuter airline
safety standards would be elevated to match those of regular airlines.
Pena set a 100-day deadline for this to be achieved. 'We are very troubled
by the number of accidents we've had this year,' he said.
An American Eagle spokesman said the company had complete confidence in the
type of aircraft it uses.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Business Travel: The pick of the Parisian 'palaces' -
Nicholas Haslam offers a guide to the benefits, and expense, of staying in
the top hotels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS HASLAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Parisians modestly call their best hotels 'palaces', but then argue
furiously over which ones merit the title. Yet no one seems to doubt that
the Plaza Athenee, the King George V, the Crillon and the Ritz are in line
for first place.
Sited in the exclusive central 1st and 8th arrondissements, and the briefest
of limousine rides from La Defense business and commercial district, these
hotels cater for those whose pockets - or expense accounts - are deep.
Rooms at the Plaza start at FFr2,300 (Pounds 280), while a presidential
suite costs FFr9,440. For this, however, you will receive some of the best
service any hotel can offer, and join a guest list that reads like an
international Who's Who.
A few Metro stops from the Champs Elysees, the Grand Hotel Intercontinental
looms beside the Opera in the heart of the Grand Boulevard district. With
514 rooms, the Grand is two stops from La Defense on the express rail RER,
and has one of the largest conference rooms in the centre of Paris. Sixty
per cent of guests are business people. A single room costs FFr1,600, but
low-season reductions of up to 25 per cent are available.
Do not count, however, on hanging on to your savings: partners waiting for
spouses to return from interminable business meetings can go shopping at
Galeries Lafayette across the road, where guests from the Grand get a 10 per
cent discount.
If you want to lunch outside the hotel, the area is full of excellent little
restaurants. The Petit Gaillon in Rue Gaillon, just by the Opera, has
excellent French and Senegalese food, and the Chartier at 7 Faubourg
Montmartre offers reasonable food amid the decor of a 19th century
brasserie.
People say in Paris that if you work on the Right Bank, you play on the
Left. For those not tied to full schedules at La Defense, many hotels on the
Left Bank have a particular character and charm.
The Lutetia on Boulevard Raspail has one of the best art deco facades in
Paris. It is close to the Senate and the Sorbonne, and many guests are
diplomats, politicians and academics.
The hotel has 280 rooms and 12 conference rooms, the largest of which can
hold up to 500 people. Rooms start from FFr950, while a two-bedroom
apartment costs FFr6,000. The Brasserie Lutetia fronting the hotel is a
well-known rendezvous. (While sipping a beer and watching the crowds go by,
it is best not to think of the Lutetia's guests half a century ago, when the
hotel served as Gestapo HQ.)
Not far from the Lutetia, next to the Gallimard publishing house, is Hotel
Montalembert. Reopened in 1991 after a year-long restoration, the hotel
oozes Left Bank literary chic. An oak-panelled library opens off the main
foyer, and the hotel numbers Carlos Fuentes and William Boyd among its
guests.
The 51 rooms and five suites are individually furnished in a mixture of
traditional and modern French design, and start at FFr1,625. There are two
conference rooms, the largest with a capacity for 25.
At the back of the Montalembert, on Rue de l'Universite and Rue Jacob
respectively, are two smaller hotels patronised by fashion buyers,
journalists, artists and musicians.
The Lenox has 30 designer-furnished rooms, and those on the top floor have
views across lead-covered roof tops to the Louvre across the Seine. A double
room costs FFr590 and a duplex apartment FFr960.
La Villa, 100 metres down the road, has 32 rooms and a jazz club with an
international reputation in the basement. The management stresses that the
club is well insulated from the rooms above, which start at FFr800 (suites
FFr1,950).
Women business travellers alone in Paris should note that the Left Bank is
one of the city's most secure areas, night and day. And non-French speakers
should get a copy of Pariscope, a weekly magazine with a section in English
that lists everything, from theatres to flea markets.

FT  19 DEC 94 / This Week: Letters from Alistair Cooke - Sport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only two sorts of sports reporting really impress me. The first comes from
the committed expert, steeped in the subject and communicating passion and
depth of knowledge to his audience. The prose may be lumpy and the metaphor
ugly, but almost every word contributes to the story behind the story.
Read, say, Captain Mark Phillips' regular columns on eventing and you will
quickly appreciate two things: that the six-time Badminton winner is more
comfortable in a saddle than at a keyboard, and that what he doesn't know
about horse trials isn't worth knowing.
The second type of reporting is rarer. It flows from naturally gifted
writers who have an intuitive affinity for the tides and eddies of specific
sports. Glance at Norman Mailer's pieces on American boxing in the 1960s, or
the work of the black Marxist historian C L R James on West Indian cricket,
and the quality is obvious.
Last week I inadvertently opened a Christmas present a day or two early and
made a stunning discovery. It was a collection of sports pieces by Alistair
Cooke, scarcely known in this field of endeavour. But its quality puts him
up there with Mailer or James.
For those who have been living on Mars, Cooke's weekly Letter from America
has been broadcast by BBC radio since 1945. Its elegant phrases, honeyed
delivery and folksy insights reach Britain and 51 other countries. I have no
audience figures but suspect that, like the King James Bible, Letter from
America is nowadays revered but seldom listened to.
Perhaps Cooke should have stayed on the back pages. For 25 years he was also
a newspaperman covering US sport, among other things, for The Times and then
The Guardian. Here is Cooke describing the savagery of the 1951 fight at
Madison Square Garden when Sugar Ray Robinson regained the world
middleweight championship from Randolph Turpin. Reading it, one should
remember that just 10 days earlier the young boxer George Flores had been
killed fighting in the same ring.
'Last night Sugar Ray Robinson, tiring to the point of panic before the
concrete insensibility of Turpin's massive flesh,' wrote Cooke, 'wrung
everything he had from a brave heart, fought from his fingertips, and at
last had Turpin helpless against the ropes, his arms by his thighs, his
stubborn body reeling back and forth like a badly beaten bull when the flags
go in.
'I have never seen a human being receive so much punishment with such dumb
bravery. For almost a whole minute Robinson crashed and shot and pounded on
him until his head sagged from one side to the other with the flopping
rhythm of a broken pendulum.'
It might be argued that violent melodrama is easy to describe. But Cooke
also had the subtlest of touches, mocking the shamefully rigged fight in
1953 that gave Rocky Marciano a two-minute knockout over his lacklustre
opponent. 'Jersey Joe Walcott sat down on the mat in Chicago last night,
cocked his head to hear the referee call a count of 10, and then got up and
went home, complaining he had been robbed. It was never quite clear in the
confusion exactly who had been robbed ..
'There is no boo like the boo of a man who has paid Dollars 50 for two
minutes of aimless shuffling. When the referee hoisted Marciano's arm and
the bell rang, all the tired trans-continental aeroplane passengers, the
preening celebrities, and the boys who had traded a week's baseball tickets
for a seat against the skyline, bared their teeth and let loose like wounded
hyenas.' In his introduction to the book, Cooke gives one to understand
that, for him, sports reporting was a light-hearted diversion from the
realities of the Cold War in the America of Eisenhower and Truman.
Cooke's world was the White House and the minutiae of international
politics. But his personal absorption in - first - fishing and then golf and
tennis, provided a perceptive view of the big events. 'I have come to feel a
deep, unspoken pity for people who have no attachment to a single sport,
almost as sorry for them as I am for teetotallers,' he writes in his
introduction.
His own passion for golf has been known to creep into more than the odd
radio epistle, but Cooke's reports from the frontline of the major
tournaments were hitherto unknown to me. In 1965 he was at Bellerive Country
Club, Missouri, covering Gary Player's play-off win over Kelvin Nagle to
take the US Open. Cooke's report centred on the intensity with which Player
scrutinised every lie 'like a laboratory technician with a blood sample'.
As a hot afternoon under the mid-western sun ground on, Cooke described the
breathless concentration shown by an extraordinarily focused Player: 'And so
into the twilight he pondered his iron shots for minutes on end, climbed
hills and knolls and stood on his head to gauge the break of the green,
lined up a 2ft putt from the pin and the apron - and back again - and picked
up every dewdrop or hint of fuzz in between. Never did hypochondria reap
such a rich reward.'
Just reading that made me hold my breath, as if I had been alongside Cooke
on the parched fairways of Bellerive. His wry humour at the expense of his
beloved golf is even more enjoyable. This is from Cooke's brief cod-history
of the game, in a passage explaining why the king tried, in 1457, to ban it:
'James did not recognise what every other Scot knew in his bones: that golf
was just what the Scottish character had been searching for, for centuries.
Namely, a method of self-torture disguised as a game ..'
The emblem on the necktie of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews -
the Vatican of golf - shows St Andrew himself bearing the saltire cross, on
which he was to be stretched before he was crucified. 'Only the Scots,'
wrote Cooke, 'would have thought of celebrating a national game with the
figure of a tortured saint.'

FT  19 DEC 94 / This Week: FT Guide To EU Inter-governmental Conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What will the European Union's 1996 inter-governmental conference be about,
and why the sudden interest?
In 1996, the 15 members of the EU are due to review the operation of the
Maastricht treaty, and possibly amend it. French and British Euro-sceptics
are worried that the conference (IGC) could mark a second great leap forward
in European political and economic integration. Dissident British Tories are
warning about 'Son of Maastricht'. They are demanding a referendum, before
or after the conference.
Why the referendum fever? After all, Britain held one on EU membership in
1975.
UK prime minister John Major hints that he might hold a referendum, but only
if the IGC produces far-reaching constitutional changes. At this stage, the
chances of a 'big bang' IGC look remote. Jacques Delors' decision against
running for the French presidency makes a Franco-German push in 1996 for
deeper, faster integration less likely.
OK, but what about the single European currency? Jacques Chirac, the
Gaullist presidential candidate in France, says he favours a referendum on
European monetary union.
True. But contrary to popular belief, the IGC will not discuss policy issues
such as the single-currency project. It will only examine possible treaty
changes. Anyway, Emu is already in train. There could be a move to Emu in
1997, but 1999 is far more likely.
Why?
Maastricht says that Emu can only be triggered in 1997 if a majority of the
15 member states meet tough targets on budget deficits, government debt
levels, exchange rate stability and interest rates. In 1999, you do not
require a majority - just those countries which meet these so-called
convergence criteria. If a privileged group does go ahead, it could be very
divisive. Either way, Britain would face a tricky decision on staying in or
out.
If Emu is off, what is on the 1996 agenda?
One of the big topics is European defence policy. Britain led opposition to
moving too fast towards a separate European defence 'identity' in 1991,
because it was worried about undermining the Nato alliance and upsetting the
Americans. But that was before the Bosnian war, and before the US made clear
it wanted the Europeans to take more responsibilty for defence matters,
albeit under Nato's umbrella.
So what might come out of the conference?
Reports of a future common European army are wildly exaggerated. But the
British, French and Germans are interested in strengthening the Western
European Union, the EU's fledgling defence arm. Pay attention, too, to the
Anglo-French axis. Paris and London have been 'bonding' in Bosnia as the
biggest contributors to the UN peace-keeping operation, and they are
planning a joint air command. Also, Britain thinks that playing the defence
card is the best way to bolster its Euro-credentials with Paris.
Any other business in 1996?
Everyone, even the British, appears to agree that some institutional changes
in the Union will have to take place to prepare for the next round of
enlargement - that is, the entry of the former communist countries of
central and eastern Europe, as well as Cyprus and Malta, around the turn of
the century. Most people think the Union may have as many as 27 countries by
2005-2010.
What are the options for institutional change?
Mind-numbingly numerous. The British want a minimalist agenda. They would
like to cut down the number of commissioners (presently 20), but that means
breaking the tradition that every country has its own commissioner. The big
countries want to tinker with the voting system in the EU decision-making
body, the Council of Ministers. The present system is weighted
disproportionately in favour of the smaller member states.
So what is John Major's problem?
Germany and the federalist-minded smaller states would also like to
introduce more majority decision-making and reduce the power of the national
veto. Another sensitive area is justice and home affairs. Chancellor Kohl
would like to introduce supranational decision-making to tackle organised
crime and drug trafficking. His dream is to turn Europol, the fledgling
police network, into a European FBI. That is anathema to the
sovereignty-conscious British and French, but still bet on some movement
here.
What about the European Parliament?
Kohl believes that strengthening the Strasbourg assembly is the best chance
of filling the 'democratic deficit' in Europe. He would like to increase its
power of co-decision in EU legislation. But he could run into opposition in
1996 from countries such as Britain and Denmark which see their own national
parliaments as the big players, and are reluctant to cede more powers to
Strasbourg.
What is the next step in preparing for 1996?
The European Commission, the European Parliament and a group of selected
representatives of the 15 member states will shortly submit papers
identifying the institutional problems created by future enlargement and a
possible agenda for 1996. The smart money is on a long IGC, probably lasting
beyond the next UK election. Perhaps John Major will not even be around to
conclude the negotiations. In which case, step forward Tony Blair, the UK
Labour party leader.

FT  19 DEC 94 / This Week: Restoring the magic that is India - Colin Amery
looks at an Anglo-Indian plan to renovate some of the country's best
buildings / Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sometimes government ministers have inspired ideas that can have cultural as
well as political significance. On his recent trade mission to India,
Richard Needham, the UK trade minister, launched a scheme to restore
historic buildings there, his enthusiasm being fired by the number of
high-quality Indian buildings.
No one can doubt the historical significance of the country's Indo-British
architectural heritage. The variety of architecture is astounding, and what
is always apparent is the way that buildings of the British period drew so
heavily upon Indian roots. Although there was an imperial element in the big
government buildings, all of them were built by skilled Indian craftsmen and
contractors.
Indians have always been great builders, their work ranging from Hindu
temples to the vast cities of the Moghul empire. The country's climate is
curiously kind to buildings - and the scarcity of resources means important
remains of many empires have not been built over.
The 50th anniversary of the independence and partition of India is in 1997.
It would be an appropriate year to celebrate the completion of some of the
big projects of architectural restoration and refurbishment to be carried
out by British and Indian companies, under the wing of the Indo-British
Partnership.
This collaboration should work both ways. There is enormous interest in
Britain in the heritage of India, and several national museums and
collections in Britain have great collections of Indian fine and decorative
arts. There should be British firms working on the great buildings of India
and Indian businesses in the UK helping to secure a rational future for the
great Indian cultural collections in Britain.
The Confederation of Indian Industry has already shown great interest in the
idea of a cleaning, restoration and general face-lifting operation, and the
co-operation of British firms could be both profitable and culturally
significant. For example, Calcutta has a great architectural heritage, and
there is a lot that can be done to enhance the buildings and give them a new
lease of life.
The best buildings of Calcutta are not necessarily the government ones. Look
at the extraordinary richness of an apartment block like Esplanade Mansions
 -a cross between Harrods and the cliff-like facades of a Hindu temple.
Take, for example, commercial premises such as the Writers' Building, the
Royal Insurance Building or Satchidananda Chambers - all of these are highly
original structures.
In turn, Bombay has some of the best 19th century buildings of any city in
the world. The University buildings, in the Italian Gothic style, look much
better in India than their Victorian equivalents in Britain, and the climate
in Bombay is much more suited to cloisters and open arcades than the climate
of Oxford or London.
Commercial buildings and libraries, churches and hotels all continue to be
cared for in Bombay, despite their imperial origins. What an opportunity to
restore them and make the most of their unique architectural quality.
Bangalore and New Delhi are equally obvious candidates for this initiative.
Bangalore has still got a very fine set of military buildings, as well as
public ones of great distinction. New Delhi may initially appear as an
inappropriately grand city, but the plan by Sir Edwin Lutyens and the
quality of his architecture put the city into the class of a world monument.
Lutyens was highly gifted in his ability to absorb the finest aspects of
Moghul, Hindu and Buddhist architecture into his designs when the new
capital of the sub-continent moved from Calcutta to Delhi. He absorbed the
architectural culture while his partner (and later rival) Sir Herbert Baker
only applied it to western models. New Delhi needs the help and skills of
firms in the Indo-British Partnership to secure its architectural future.
The British period in India is seen as just another period of history - but
it was undoubtedly a very important one architecturally.

Channel Four's business series High Interest has been given a new title and
a later slot (Tuesday, December 20, 9.00-9.45pm) for its programme on Anne
Summers. The sex shop company only agreed to participate in the programme
because of the business angle. It presents a fascinating look at the
company's marketing success.
Body fluids will be spilled in Rumble In The Jungle (Friday, Dec 23,
9.00-9.45pm, BBC2), which looks at the bloody, sweaty world heavyweight
boxing match between George Foreman and an out-of-condition Muhammad Ali.
Two decades on, this documentary assesses how extraordinary a feat it was.
An equally weighty Victoria Wood does a sketch about a fat aerobics
instructor in her Christmas Special (Sunday, Dec 25, 9.40-10.30pm, BBC1),
although nowadays she needs padding to play the part.
On the other side, real fat ladies will be singing in Elijah Moshinsky's
production of Aida (Dec 25, 7.00-9.35pm, BBC2). It features Cheryl Studer
and Dennis O'Neill. Channel Four's operatic offering is Turandot (Dec 25,
3.15-5.20pm) with sets and costumes by David Hockney. Tune in for the last
act if you only want to listen to Nessun Dorma. There is more opera the
following day with a two-part profile of Verdi (Tuesday, Dec 27,
5.00-6.00pm, BBC2).
Singers of a different strain take over with Flanders and Swann (Tuesday,
Dec 27, 6.50-7.30pm, BBC2) - a tribute to mark the death of Donald Swann
this year. A new generation will learn the joys of being a gnu.
An Equinox Special (Wednesday, Dec 28, 8.30-10.00pm, C4) takes a magnifying
glass to forensic science. DNA profiling and finger-printing were thought to
be unassailable methods of identification, but a growing number of experts
are wondering if these aids to crime detection are quite as infallible as
they initially seemed to be.

A double century for Mike Gatting at the weekend, but it still looks a case

HORSE RACING: King George V1 Tripleprint Chase, December 26, Kempton Park.
The big race at Kempton on Boxing Day is expected to be a three-cornered

What should we do to film distributors for Christmas? Is there anything
punitive enough? Possessed of the spirit of Scrooge, they are introducing
just one film in the week before Christmas - a US offering about
little-league ice hockey that is a second visit to a story which was silly
enough the first time. D2: The Mighty Ducks (the sequel) will lure no one
from their turkey, even though it is one. If you want a treat this week, you
must choose among films already on release. The Nightmare Before Christmas
remains the top ticket. Nanni Moretti's Dear Diary is still the sweetest
auteur comedy since early Woody Allen. And The Adventures Of Priscilla,
Queen Of The Desert is a high-camp charmer from Down Under.
As for last week's Princess Caraboo, (above) it is almost funny enough to be
considered. Kevin Kline steals the show as a Greek butler, though the show
is erratic. Plot: is the vagrant girl played by Phoebe Cates (Mrs Kline)
really an Indonesian princess? If not, how silly will the 19th century Brits
and aristos who adopt her feel, having feted her, festooned her in
fashionable dresses and all but fed her to the Prince Regent (John
Sessions). Witty; could be wittier; worth seeing on a rainy day.
Meanwhile, Macaulay Culkin maniacs have the boy times two. He is dull in The
Pagemaster but he is a treat - childhood idiocy made radiant - in The
Nutcracker, where he capers about in the filmed ballet wearing his Home
Alone grin, mischief-making moue and flapping eyelids.
Your VCR will probably go through industrial stress over the next seven
days, what with Brief Encounter, the complete works of James Bond - and
children playing video games of Einsteinian complexity. For thoughtful
relaxation you could try two new issues. Fellini's Roma is the maestro's
slyly beautiful mockumentary about the Eternal City. And Innocent Moves, the
tale of a boy chess prodigy, makes this sit-down game more exciting than any
sport, including ice hockey.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Management: The annual agony of Christmas giving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is now the Christmas party season: a time for lechery and indolence. It
is also a time of gift exchange, personal and corporate, which like so many
things at Christmas is fraught with difficulty.
Gift buying is an annual torment which means so much to the chancellor of
the exchequer, the high street shops and the credit card companies. But what
makes this business of gift exchange and present-buying so difficult?
Maybe it is because they are imbued with much meaning - they can be
statements of influence, power, taste, sympathy or emotion.
It is not only the problem of to whom one gives presents or not, and/or how
much/little to spend, but more importantly what sort of item to purchase.
Gifts are one of the ways in which the mental pictures others have of us are
transmitted and likewise, we disclose to our gift recipients our pictures of
them.
The subtlety of the exchange can be best seen when it goes wrong. We can all
remember, as a child, receiving a present which was insulting because we had
outgrown it.
On the other hand, over-eager parents may cause extreme anxiety by giving
gifts for which the child is simply not ready. Most toy manufacturers
recognise this problem and indicate the toy's appropriate age range.
Wouldn't it be fun to do the same for adult presents, putting labels on
aftershave like 'ideal for Essex man'; or executive toys 'for the middle
manager going nowhere'?
It is precisely because we give people something 'suitable', as we perceive
it, that individuals are so frequently given the same sort of present. How
many executives receive bottles of whisky?
Should a person receive a variety of unusual presents, one may wonder at the
gift-givers' very different perceptions and the real identity of the
recipient.
The Christmas present also imposes an identity on the giver, as well as the
receiver. Some men confirm their 'macho' identity by presenting non-personal
gifts, such as cigars following the birth of a child. There is the
conspicuous presentation of expensive gifts to celebrate simultaneously
one's wealth and generosity. A gift may also be a portion of oneself - a
sort of example of one's talent - so the artistic give pictures, gardeners a
plant.
Gifts can be an important source of dominance particularly if one cannot
reciprocate. Occasionally, adults can embarrass each other by the generosity
of the present. To accept a gift is, to an extent, to accept the identity it
imposes.
However, gifts can be rejected if they are perceived as unfriendly acts. A
giver may express contempt by purchasing a gift for an individual which is
inferior to those openly given to others. Gifts may have symbolic qualities
 -a gold watch for good riddance, travel luggage encouraging a long journey.
'Hint-type' presents may also be rejected - cosmetics to conceal poor skin,
a watch for the habitually late. Many 'joke' presents fall into this
category, for example, hot, spicy chewing gum (for the loud mouthed). Joke
gifts may also reflect a rather insecure relationship. Just as easily, gifts
can be an expression of guilt, such as an attempt to compensate for a
certain deficit. They make excellent items to use in the atonement of sins
but they can be easily rejected as not being sufficiently compensatory.
Exchanging presents is another, more acceptable form of rejection. There are
so many people returning unwanted gifts to the stores after Christmas
(clearly not always because the size is wrong) that one wonders if anybody
received a present which they wanted.
Some groups try to prevent gift inflation, such as setting a limit on a
present's cost.
Another way of coping can be to set aside certain goods or services as
specifically gift-related and somehow not part of the mundane economic
world. Confectionery and gift tokens play an important role here.
But, however hard people try, the social rankings so beloved by the British
are reflected in, and maintained by, Christmas gifts, for the allocation of
the quality and quantity of presents brings people into comparison who are
rarely contrasted with one another. 'What did you get for Christmas?'
provides excellent data on exactly where someone stands in the pecking
order.
Both buying and receiving presents is a maze, full of rules and conventions
and sub-texts and messages about multiple facets of the giver and receiver
alike. Even a statement of one's ideal gift can be a minefield, as a British
ambassador to Washington once discovered.
The diplomatic envoys from several countries were canvassed by a local radio
station; the French ambassador described his ideal Christmas present as
peace throughout the world, the Canadian ambassador wished for an end to
starvation, while the British ambassador requested a nice box of
crystallised fruit.

How do you think you would react if you had to view corpses and accompany

Such questions may seem bizarre but they are routine for applicants to the
UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
Before filing an application, would-be diplomats complete a 'self-assessment
questionnaire' which is meant to test their suitability for the sort of
professional and social life they can expect while working for the foreign
office. Candidates score themselves, and if they reach a designated
threshold, they are invited to proceed with the application. If not, they
are told to consider another career.
Customised psychometric tests of this kind are not just used to identify the
flexible types required to defend and advance British interests. Their
popularity is rising in the UK and some estimates suggest the majority of
larger companies have used the tests to assess personalities and abilities
for recruitment, career development, team-building and, in some cases,
redundancy selection.
The tests are not without controversy. Several cases recently have
highlighted the varying quality of test providers and the dangers which can
arise if they are sold for the wrong purpose or fall into the wrong hands.
These have led to calls from occupational psychologists, personnel managers
and, most recently, trade unions for better administrative standards.
Testing is not new. Intelligence and personality tests were first used on a
large scale by the US army to determine who could handle the stress of
trench warfare in the first world war. In the 1950s and 1960s, interest in
the UK was fuelled by the growth of graduate trainee schemes in large
corporations, when employers used the tests on inexperienced candidates.
Experts say it is important to distinguish between ability tests, which
measure numeracy and verbal skill, and personality tests, which measure
people's perceptions of their own behaviour.
If properly used and designed to evaluate skills relevant to the job being
filled, many psychologists agree that ability tests can be highly effective.
The use of personality tests, however, is more controversial.
Unison, the public service union, has raised questions about the use of
personality tests when Anglian Water decided it needed to shed 900 staff as
part of a big reorganisation. All staff were given a personality test to
help managers decide who would be given new jobs.
According to Unison, the company said the tests would only influence 30 per
cent of the decision. But Unison says the tests must have had more weight in
the process. The union also claims the company determined the competences
the test would identify before it had determined what characteristics or
skills were needed for the jobs.
In the US, a court in California awarded Dollars 1.3m (Pounds 800,000)
damages against a supermarket chain which had used a personality test to
recruit security guards. One of the recruits complained that the questions
were intrusive and bore no relation to the job he was being required to do.
Similar complaints have been voiced by UK employees who lost their jobs at
Southwark Council in London after personality tests were used to decide who
was made redundant in a job-shedding exercise earlier this year. Unison is
taking up the Southwark incident in an unfair dismissal case before an
industrial tribunal.
It may take one of these cases to remove the veil of statistical and
psychological jargon that characterises academic debate and salesmanship in
psychometrics. The excessive use of jargon is one reason why psychometric
tests are so open to abuse. Management neglect is another issue. Because
tests are used mainly as a recruitment tool, senior executives have often
been content to leave their adoption and use to personnel specialists who,
some critics believe, have been too ready to embrace psychometrics as
another 'boy scout badge' in the field of human resources.
'There is a lot of black magic around psychometric tests,' says Steven
Blinkhorn, co-director of Psychometric Research &amp; Development, a consultancy
which develops custom-built tests. 'It gives personnel managers a sort of
cachet because it gives them something they can do that others in the
organisation cannot.'
That said, many psychologists and personnel managers argue that psychometric
tests can add value to a company's selection or career development processes
and that they are better guides to a candidate's potential than the
interview, references, letters of application and other traditional
selection methods.
'The same kind of critical criteria that are applied to tests are not
applied to the interview as a selection method,' says Clive Fletcher of
Goldsmith College, London University. 'The interview does not predict future
performance at all and it is a marvellous vehicle for bias.'
Blinkhorn and his consultancy partner Charles Johnson have written that such
tests can often 'bamboozle an unsophisticated public with pseudo science'
and that tests 'play fast and loose with statistical methods, and . . . make
claims that do not stand up to close inspection.'
Steve Sefton, manager of ASE, the business psychology division of test
publisher NFER-Nelson, is not as critical but concedes the tests have their
limitations. 'Tests are really designed to be predictive of people's
behaviour, rather than their job performance,' he explains.
Along with the other leading test publishers, however, he insists that
personality tests can be helpful tools in selection if used and understood
correctly in conjunction with other recruitment methods.
Many psychologists, however, believe no test should be used in isolation or
for redundancy purposes. 'Tests should be used as a part of a battery of
selection techniques such as interviews, group discussions and application
forms,' says David Bartram of Hull University, and a member of the test
standards committee at the British Psychological Society.
Saville and Holdsworth, the UK's largest test publisher, with a turnover of
Pounds 30m worldwide, publishes hundreds of tests, including the
Occupational Personality Questionnaire, which is one of the most respected
on the market. Other reputable tests include the 16PF, published in the UK
by ASE, and the Myers Briggs, which was developed by two Americans in the
1960s. There are more than 5,000 tests in the English language on the
market, some of which, say the BPS, are of dubious validity.
The Institute of Personnel and Development has developed a code of conduct
for its members and the six leading test publishers have issued guidelines
for test publishers and users. But none of these bodies has regulatory
clout; nor can they vouch for the effectiveness of test methods.
In an attempt to introduce some standards into the field, the BPS has
devised certificates of competence for those administering ability tests;
equivalent qualifications for personality tests are expected sometime next
year.
To obtain a certificate, company personnel officers have to enrol in BPS
training courses run by chartered psychologists. The courses train
non-psychologists to distinguish between types of tests, analyse statistical
data, identify the abilities or characteristics that need to be tested, and
judge if a test is valid for a company's needs.
Leading publishers are also attempting to police their own tests and improve
training - though their motives may not be entirely altruistic. Users of
Saville and Holdsworth's tests, for example, must attend week-long courses
before being allowed to purchase any of the materials. Such training is
expensive: users can expect to pay more than Pounds 4,000 for a course. The
requirement to attend in-house training before tests can be bought, though,
means the publishers may be 'milking the market', according to Pauline
Grant, business director of IARC-Ashridge, a consultancy.
The respectable publishers, however, are not the main problem. Price often
influences choice and cheap, quick-fix tests that claim to be easy to
operate are often run on computers and probably have as much to do with
objectivity as the 'Are you the world's best lover?' quizzes in teenage
magazines which have proved highly popular.
Research dating back to 1958 shows that poor tests are about as good as
star-sign columns in Sunday magazines. A psychologist tested 68 personnel
managers and later gave them each identical reports describing their
personality. In what is known as the Barnum effect, half of them described
the report as 'amazingly accurate', and 40 per cent of them said it was
'rather good', while the other 10 per cent thought it was 'half and half'.
Before any test is adopted, employers should conduct a thorough job
analysis. 'The first thing you need to do is identify the task demands of
the job,' says Blinkhorn. 'Ask if people need to bring those skills
ready-made or if some of these skills are in part learned on the job.'
Recruiters needed to talk to people already doing the job, as well as
supervisors and management. Once the skills and characteristics genuinely
needed for the job are identified, then an employer is better placed to
choose the best test to evaluate them.
Perhaps the most important thing for potential test-users to remember,
however, is that the tests have their limitations. When assessing
personality, Grant says 'people with very different personality
characteristics could both do the same job very well'.
Bartram also says employers need to decide whether they want to measure
personality at all before they decide which test to use. All too often, he
says, the debate is focused on the quality of the test rather than the
question of whether personality is relevant to the job at all.
If a company does decide to use psychometric instruments, he says there is
no justification for choosing inappropriate tests, just to save a few
pounds. 'In the long run, companies who use unreliable, cheap tests are
going to lose out by doing that. They will be picking people who are not the
best for the job.'

FT  19 DEC 94 / Management: Pioneers and Prophets - Nicolo Machiavelli
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART CRAINER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amid the grey-suited pantheon of management greats, Nicolo Machiavelli
(1469-1527) holds an unlikely, but undeniable, place. A Florentine diplomat
and writer, his career was colourful - punctuated by interludes of
indulgence in 'petty dissipations'. His abiding relevance to the world of
management rests on a slim volume, The Prince.
The Prince is the 16th-century equivalent of Dale Carnegie's How to Make
Friends and Influence People. Embedded beneath details of Alexander VI's
tribulations, lies a ready supply of aphorisms and insights which are as
appropriate to many of today's managers and organisations as they were
nearly 500 years ago.
'It is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities I have
enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them,' Machiavelli
advises, adding the suggestion that it is useful 'to be a great pretender
and dissembler'. But The Prince goes beyond such helpful presentational
hints.
Like all the great books, it offers something for everyone. Take Machiavelli
on managing change: 'There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more
perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead
in the introduction of a new order of things.' Or on sustaining motivation:
'He ought, above all things, to keep his men well-organised and drilled, to
follow incessantly the chase.'
Above all, Machiavelli is the champion of leadership through cunning and
intrigue, the triumph of force over reason. An admirer of Borgia,
Machiavelli had a dismal view of human nature. Empowerment was not in his
vocabulary.
Unfortunately history has repeatedly proved that a combination of being
armed to the teeth and devious is more likely to allow you to achieve your
objectives. It is all very well being good, says Machiavelli, but the leader
'should know how to enter into evil when necessity commands'.
According to psychologist Robert Sharrock of consultants YSC: 'Like the
leaders Machiavelli sought to defend, some executives tend to see themselves
as the natural rulers in whose hands organisations can be entrusted.
Theories abound on their motivation. Is it a defensive reaction against
failure or a need for predictability through control? The effect of the
power-driven Machiavellian manager is usually plain to see.'
In companies addicted to internal politics, Machiavelli remains the stuff of
day-to-day reality. But, warns Sharrock, Machiavellian management may have
had its day. 'The gentle art of persuasion is finding fashion with managers.
The ends no longer justify the means. There is a return to the age of reason
against which Machiavelli rebelled.'
For many the age of reason has yet to dawn. Managers may not have read The
Prince but will be able to identify with Machiavelli's observation that 'a
prince ought to have no other aim or thought, nor select anything else for
his study, than war and its rules and discipline'. In the corporate
trenches, Machiavelli remains useful Christmas reading.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Management: What's the score on choice?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Selecting a test involves more than flipping through a few catalogues and
picking one that sounds good. Conscientious employers should consider a
number of factors before choosing a test.
David Bartram of Hull University, and a member of the British Psychological
Society's test standards committee, encourages employers to examine any
potential test for:
Scope - what areas of ability or personality are you trying to cover?
Accuracy or reliability - will the same test yield similar results if the
same individual sits in two weeks' time?
Validity - does the test measure what it says it does?
For example, if a test yields a score on a person's persuasiveness, will the
person who scores high on that scale actually be more persuasive than others
who score low on the scale?
A good test should always include statistical data to back up its claims of
validity, and the BPS competency courses should train users to be able to
read these statistics.
Fairness - is there any evidence to show that the test is unfairly biased
against certain groups, such as women or ethnic minorities?
Acceptability - how well will the test you are planning to use fit into the
organisation and its image?
Practicality - assess the time, resources and cost factors involved with the
test.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Conservative Party Funding: Two-pronged attack on Pounds 15m
debts - How the Conservative party raises money from industry has long been
one of the great puzzles of UK political life. In a special report, Peter
Marsh, with William Lewis, Jimmy Burns, Roland Adburgham and Robert Peston,
unravels some aspects of the mystery / Fundraisers
</HEADLINE>

PESTON

<TEXT>
The Conservative party's fundraising operation is headed by the double act
of Lord Hambro, chairman of Hambros, the blue chip merchant bank, and Sir
Philip Harris, chairman of Carpetright, the discount carpet retailer.
The duo, appointed party treasurer and deputy treasurer respectively last
year, come from different backgrounds, but insiders say they have developed
a close-knit 'nasty and nice' fundraising technique in their quest to reduce
the party's Pounds 15m overdraft.
One Tory party source said: 'Hambro is the titular head. He sweet-talks the
donors and Harris comes in the next day to collect the cheques.'
Sir Philip said last week: 'We are a team, but Charlie (Lord Hambro) and I
do not go to the same people. I look after the retailers and industrialists
and he looks after insurance and banking.
'We talk to them and say: 'We want you to support us.' But we are not nasty,
we do not say: 'If you do not give money then Labour is going to get in.' We
talk to them about Conservative policies and what they have done in the past
few years. We talk to them about paying less tax.'
Lord Hambro is said 'to charm donations' from companies. Mr David Verey,
chief executive of merchant bank Lazard Brothers, which has given Pounds
180,000 to the Conservative party since 1986, said of Lord Hambro: 'He is a
gentle chap. I would not expect him to beat up anyone who did not want to
give.'
Another example of how Lord Hambro's charm offensive has paid dividends
comes from Robert Fleming, the City bank. Mr John Manser, chief executive,
said that after receiving a letter from Lord Hambro asking for extra cash to
help reduce the overdraft, the company last year increased its donation by
50 per cent from Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 75,000.
Lord Hambro is well connected in the City. He has been on the board of
Hambros since 1970 and is chairman of the Guardian Royal Exchange insurance
company, where he has been a director since 1968. Additionally, he has been
a director of Taylor Woodrow, the construction group, for 32 years and of
the P&amp;O shipping group since 1987. In the time he has been on their boards
these companies have given the Tories a total of Pounds 3.58m, worth Pounds
6.43m in today's money.
One of Lord Hambro's employees described him as 'incredibly shy'. His
discretion about his role as Conservative party fundraiser may have been
inherited from his father, a leading intelligence figure in the second world
war.
Sir Philip's style is 'more straightforward and to the point', according to
a senior executive of a retail company who has had dealings with him. Sir
Philip said: 'I make them see the logic of it. Raising money for the
Conservative party is like raising money for charity, which I do.
'When I am talking to companies I just tell them if you want a Conservative
party, support us. I can only tell them what is happening.'
Of the four other businessmen who assist Lord Hambro and Sir Philip on the
Conservatives' board of treasurers, which oversees the party's fundraising,
Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman of Slough Estates, is given responsibility for
donations from property companies, while Mr David Davies, chairman of
Johnson Matthey, looks after foreign gifts.
Mr William Hughes, chairman of Grampian Holdings, is responsible for raising
cash from Scottish industrialists, while Sir Malcolm Chaplin, senior partner
of Hilberty Chaplin surveyors, looks after constituency funds.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Conservative Party Funding: Top companies reduce
contributions - How the Conservative party raises money from industry has
long been one of the great puzzles of UK political life. In a special
report, Peter Marsh, with William Lewis, Jimmy Burns, Roland Adburgham and

Cash gifts to the Conservatives from Britain's biggest 100 companies have
fallen sharply in the past five years, as big business has become
increasingly reluctant to support the government publicly.
Donations last year from the biggest 100 UK companies - ranked by stock
market capitalisation at the end of September 1994 - were down 34.3 per cent
in real terms compared with 1988, the comparable year in the general
election cycle.
An analysis of 20 big Conservative donors outside the biggest 100 companies
shows similar trends.
Total Tory donations from all companies and individuals over the period
have, however, more than kept pace with inflation. This shows that the party
has had some success in making up shortfalls in gifts from big companies by
taking in more cash from unidentified sympathisers.
A survey of the annual reports of the biggest 100 companies showed 36 gave
to the Conservatives in the eight years of the survey from 1986 to 1993.
Between the general elections in 1987 and 1992 only 11 of the 36 increased
their gifts at above the rate of inflation, while 25 showed a fall in real
terms.
Sir Derrick Holden-Brown, former chairman of food and drink giant
Allied-Lyons, now Allied Domecq, said: 'It is much more difficult for the
Conservatives to extract money from companies compared with a decade ago.'
Allied Domecq cut its donation to zero last year after giving more than
Pounds 1m since 1979.
To smooth distortions, the analysis by the Financial Times concentrated on
cash gifts in two three-year periods, 1986-88 and 1991-93, around the last
two elections. Donations tend to rise ahead of a general election and go
down immediately afterwards.
Based on this analysis, payments by the top 100 companies fell a real -
inflation-adjusted - 16.3 per cent in the five years between the elections.
In nominal terms donations rose 10.2 per cent.
Over the eight years from 1986 to 1993 the biggest 100 companies provided
Pounds 10.13m, or 12.2 per cent of the Pounds 82.81m donations from all
companies. When the cash from the 20 additional big donors is added, the
figure comes to Pounds 16.31m, or 19.6 per cent of the total.
Between the two three-year periods donations to the Tory party from all
sources rose 33.3 per cent in nominal terms or 1.4 per cent in real terms.
Where the extra cash came from is a mystery since the Conservatives do not
break down the sources of cash gifts. The only way researchers can get a
clue is by looking through the reports of UK-registered companies, which by
law have to disclose political donations.
Between 1986 and 1993 donations accounted for four-fifths of Conservative
Central Office's income of Pounds 103.26m. The rest of the income came from
payments by constituency associations and money raised from such activities
as subscriptions, conferences and book sales. Over the eight years, Central
Office's income rose a relatively healthy 16.2 per cent in real terms - but
spending rose even faster, which explained the Tories' Pounds 15m overdraft
at the end of the party's last financial year in March.
In the eight years from 1986 to 1993 Allied Domecq was among the biggest
givers from the top 100 companies, providing Pounds 611,100. But between the
two three-year periods the company's donations fell from Pounds 266,200 to
Pounds 120,000, a fall of 54.9 per cent in nominal terms and 65 per cent in
real terms.
Among the other 24 companies of the top 100 which failed to match inflation,
food company United Biscuits cut back 12.2 per cent in real terms. Between
1986 and 1993 it gave Pounds 778,500 but this year it is likely to give
nothing.
Two other big donors, Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation and industrial
conglomerate Hanson, gave Pounds 730,000 and Pounds 692,000 respectively
between 1988 and 1993. Both failed marginally over the period to match their
payments with inflation but remain committed to the Tories.
Mr John Crossman, P&amp;O company secretary, said the Tories were generally
'helpful' to the business world.
Mr Richard Whitaker, company secretary of General Accident, the insurer,
said a significant factor in the 78 per cent real-terms fall in the payments
had been the Labour party's move away from leftwing policies. This had
reduced the threat to business of a non-Tory government. Others said that as
the recession had hit profits they saw fewer reasons to support the Tories.
Of the 11 companies which increased donations in real terms, Scottish &amp;
Newcastle, the brewer, showed a 17.9 per cent increase. The company said it
would 'probably' match its annual Pounds 50,000 donation of the past two
years with a similar payment this year. Tomkins, Rolls-Royce, Legal &amp;
General, Glaxo, GKN and Forte all also more than matched inflation over the
period.
In the analysis of 20 big donors, the payments of just eight companies kept
pace with inflation over the eight years. They included four big City
companies - Caledonia Investments, Robert Fleming, Baring Brothers and
Hambros.
Taylor Woodrow, the construction company which has given more than Pounds
1.3m since the late 1960s, cut its donations 45.3 per cent in real terms
over the eight years. The company, which gave Pounds 124,500 in 1992 and
Pounds 5,000 last year, said it was unlikely to return to making big
payments.
Mr John Marshall, chief executive at John Mowlem, another construction
company to cut back, said: 'We are not budgeting for any donation in the
immediate future. The trend from shareholders is not to approve of companies
making political donations.'

FT  19 DEC 94 / Conservative Party Funding: Tories pay high political price
for foreign donations - How the Conservative party raises money from
industry has long been one of the great puzzles of UK political life. In a
special report, Peter Marsh, with William Lewis, Jimmy Burns, Roland
Adburgham and Robert Peston, unravels some aspects of the mystery / Overseas
Donors

One of the main features of Conservative party funding which has dogged the
Tories in recent years is the role played by private foreign donors,
believed to be the source of millions of pounds in secret contributions.
The often rumoured total figure of Pounds 15m in the 1980s has never been
officially confirmed and recent revised estimates by senior Tory sources
suggest a figure less than half of this. Nevertheless, some foreign donors
have become fugitives from British justice, causing political problems for
the party. Their cases have increased parliamentary pressure for more
transparency in political donations.
Concern about donations to the Conservatives by Mr Asil Nadir, the former
head of the collapsed Polly Peck empire who jumped bail, led to an inquiry
by the Commons home affairs committee, which reported in April this year.
The Conservative majority on the committee saw no advantage in changing the
rules on political cash contributions, although Labour continues to call for
a ban on overseas donations.
Tory insiders say the 1980s saw Conservative fundraisers led by Lord
McAlpine, the then party treasurer, diversify from traditional supporters to
more newly rich individuals who wanted to be accepted as part of the
establishment. For years the identity of some foreign donors and the precise
sums involved remained well out of the public gaze. UK registered companies
are required by law to declare substantial political donations but the role
played by offshore companies and individual donors was known only to a small
group of senior Tories.
Only in the early 1990s, after the ousting of the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher
as leader, did the party find itself having to field searching questions
from parliament and the media about hidden donations.
In September 1991 the party was challenged to disclose the extent of its
dependence on 'foreign funds' by leading Labour MPs - Mr Jack Cunningham, Mr
Gordon Brown, Mr Frank Dobson, and Mr Tony Blair, now party leader.
In the following month it faced a further barrage from the Charter Movement,
an internal Conservative party pressure group which said: 'Central Office is
desperately looking for subsidies from almost any source, including foreign
'supporters'. We don't know what Central Office has to concede in return for
this money, but we can be absolutely sure that the interests of party
democracy are not enhanced.'
While on a visit to Hong Kong in 1991 Mr John Major was widely criticised in
the press for attending, while on government rather than party business, a
dinner at which local businessmen were being asked by local supporters to
contribute to the party.
One of the first big donors to be publicly identified through a leak from
inside the party to the press was Mr John Latsis, the Greek shipping
billionaire who is thought to have contributed Pounds 2m to the
Conservatives when Baroness Thatcher was prime minister. He used to send her
bunches of flowers.
A senior Tory confirmed: 'He was one of our biggest donors during the
1980s.' While unwilling to put a precise figure on the sums received, he
recalled how Mr Latsis once wrote out two cheques for contributions of
Pounds 200,000 each in less than two weeks.
Tory insiders confirm that Mr Li Ka-Shing, the Hong Kong millionaire and a
former business associate of Mr Mark Thatcher, Lady Thatcher's son, was
another significant foreign donor. He is thought to have contributed Pounds
500,000 after being approached by senior British business figures with
interests in Hong Kong, including Mr John 'Algie' Cluff, the oil magnate.
The Tory party's Hong Kong financial connection has continued with the
involvement of Mr David Davies, the chairman of Johnson Matthey, the metals
group, who is in charge of the party's overseas fundraising efforts. Mr
Davies has many connections in the Hong Kong business community.
In the past two years the Tory party has been hit by revelations that two
fugitives from British justice, Mr Nadir and Mr Octav Botnar, the former
head of Nissan UK, had contributed at least Pounds 440,000 and Pounds 1m
respectively. One minister, Mr Michael Mates, resigned from the government
in June last year over his links with Mr Nadir.
A few weeks ago it was Mr Mohamed Fayed, the Harrods chief, who embarrassed
the Tories by revealing that he had given a total of Pounds 250,000 in the
mid-1980s when the government was being lobbied by his arch rival, the then
Lonrho chief Mr Tiny Rowland, over Mr Fayed's purchase of Harrods.

The problems faced by East Midlands Industrial Council in recent years are
typical of those which have affected the other nine industrial councils of
England and Wales.
Several council members, who were involved in raising funds for the
Conservative party and attended regular meetings with government ministers,
have been forced by the region's economic downturn to scale back their
involvement and concentrate on their businesses.
Mr Tony Budge, who resigned his chairmanship of the council at the end of
1992 when the family company AF Budge collapsed, said the council reached
its peak in the late-1980s boom years. He said: 'Industrial councils have
suffered in line with disenchantment with politics and the Conservative
party in recent years.' Mr Budge chaired the council from 1987 and is still
a member of the party.
'The council's success was a product of the Thatcher era, when there was a
government which was asking business what it should be looking at,' he said.
Members of the council, which was at its most influential in the late 1980s,
would take two or three personal business contacts to occasional meetings
with ministers in the House of Commons. Mr Budge said: 'It was not harmful
for our own business to take our suppliers and other people with whom we
worked, and give them an opportunity to get involved.'
A small office in Grantham, Baroness Thatcher's birthplace, acts as the
headquarters of the East Midlands council, while meetings are usually held
in Newark. The council's fundraising target for this year is believed to
have been about Pounds 400,000 but members believe that no more than Pounds
120,000 has been raised.
Council chairman Mr Colin MacLeod, chairman and owner of Newark-based
Caledonian Mining, said: 'I have been on the council about seven years and
this year is the worst (for fundraising). I have never seen anything like
this.'
As well as difficulties in raising money, some members of the council are
scaling down their involvement. Mr Budge - having recently bought several AF
Budge subsidiaries from the receiver - has no intention of becoming actively
involved again, although he is still a member. Several other members
describe their membership as 'in name only'. At least one, Mr David
McErlain, former chairman of Anglo United, plans to resign.
Mr McErlain, who has raised Pounds 100,000 for the party in the past five
years, said that the role of the industrial councils was clear: 'They are a
straight money-raising unit of the party. It is a joke to say that they have
anything to do with the relationship between the government and industry.'
He said being a member of a council 'is like being a member of the party
without having a ticket'.
Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland, the airline, said he was a
member of the council 'in a personal capacity, not in a corporate sense'.
Sir Peter Mansfield, professor of physics at Nottingham University, said he
was invited on to the council by Mr Budge. He was picked as an academic to
broaden the council's membership beyond business executives. He said the
council had 'little contact' with the local Conservative party association
and had been 'fairly inactive for about six months', while a new secretary,
Maj Michael Hankinson, was appointed.
Ms Jean Parker, director of Grantham-based Vacu-Lug Traction Tyres, is the
only female member of the council and one of only a very small number of
women members in England and Wales.
She said: 'It was not a condition of my appointment that I go out and raise
money. At dinners there is generally some kind of appeal for funds but most
of us industrialists have got thick skins and do not feel obliged to
respond.' She regards herself as a 'fringe member' of the council.
Mr Reg Brealey, chairman of Indian jute company Titaghur and of Sheffield
United Football Club, is also a member but has not played an active role for
a number of years.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Conservative Party Funding: Gentlemen's clubs where money is
on tap - How the Conservative party raises money from industry has long been
one of the great puzzles of UK political life. In a special report, Peter
Marsh, with William Lewis, Jimmy Burns, Roland Adburgham and Robert Peston,
unravels some aspects of the mystery

On Budget day three weeks ago the Treasury's economic measures were not the
only talking point for a small group of Tory MPs from the west Midlands.
A few hours before Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, addressed the Commons
the MPs trooped into the Hyde Park Hotel in London's Knightsbridge for lunch
with 12 top industrialists from the region.
Behind talk about road links and the engineering industry the gathering had
a deeper purpose for Major Peter Poncia, a Conservative Central Office
official.
As the industrialists munched cheese sandwiches and sipped white wine Maj
Poncia watched out for people he might tap for money - all in the cause of
reducing the Tories' Pounds 15m overdraft and putting the party in good
shape for the next general election.
Maj Poncia is secretary of the little-known Midlands Industrial Council,
which arranged the November 29 meeting and is one of 10 such groups
organised by the Tory party.
The councils are a curious hybrid of gentleman's clubs and money-raising
agencies. They are the focal points in a secretive network of several
hundred Tory-supporting business leaders, drawn from all strands of industry
but with an accent on individualistic, wealthy entrepreneurs who identify
with the free enterprise cause.
Many of the councils have been active since the 1950s but the extent of
their activities has not been fully revealed. Most meet several times a
year, often over dinners or lunches with Tory ministers or MPs.
The occasions give Conservative-leaning industrialists the impression that
they are helping to guide policy. Money is rarely mentioned at these
sessions. That comes later, when the secretaries or council members follow
up contacts with discreet requests for cash.
The councils accept gifts from individuals but most donations come in the
form of corporate gifts. The councils are thought to have been behind about
40 per cent of donations to Conservative Central Office in recent years,
equivalent to about Pounds 3.3m a year.
Lord Laing, former chairman of the United Biscuits food company and joint
Tory party treasurer between 1988 and 1993, said: 'The councils use the old
boy network and peer pressure. Each council aims to have 10 to 12 members.
Each person would know another 10 or 12 people and (suggest) they make a
donation.'
Membership lists of the 10 councils, which have never been published,
include several self-made millionaires. Sir John Hall, the miner's son who
developed the Gateshead MetroCentre, Britain's biggest retail park, is a
member of the Northern Industrialists Protection Association, the industrial
council for north-east England.
Names linked with the network range from representatives of big, publicly
quoted companies to less well-known private groups. They include, for
instance, Mr Colin Hope, chairman of materials company T&amp;N, who is on the
north-west council, and Mr Harold Williams, chairman of Practical Car and
Van Rental of Birmingham, who is chairman of the Welsh council.
The Birmingham-based Midlands council - there is a separate East Midlands
council - is among the most productive, raising an estimated Pounds 500,000
a year. The chairman is Mr Gareth Davies, chairman of Glynwed, a big
Midlands engineering company which has given Pounds 274,000 to the Tories
since 1986.
Other members of the Midlands council include Mr Gary Allen, chief executive
of the IMI metals company, which has given Pounds 215,000 over the past
eight years, and Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN engineering group, which
has donated Pounds 185,600 over the same period.
Another powerful group is in the north-west, where the chairman is Lord
Wade, a well-connected cheesemaker and former Tory party joint treasurer.
The council is thought to raise about Pounds 300,000 a year.
Across the Pennines an active fundraiser is Mr Charles Fenton, chairman of
Bradford-based textile maker British Mohair Holdings, and chairman of the
West Yorkshire Industrialists' Council.
Mr Fenton said he was always on the lookout for successful companies. Mr
Fenton said: 'If you hear of people drinking champagne and saying whoopee
then it's reasonable to make an approach.'
About three years ago Mr Fenton contacted Mr Jeff Whalley, a Yorkshire
entrepreneur who is chairman of FKI, a Halifax-based electricals group,
which had not previously given to the Tories.
Mr Whalley joined the council and FKI has given a total of Pounds 105,000 to
the party in the last three years. Mr Whalley said the Tories had made a
success of the economy. 'If I thought they were doing an awful job I
wouldn't back them.'
The councils' secretaries are key people. Like Maj Poncia and Mr Lee they
are Conservative Central Office officials. They report to Mr Richard Warner,
a former banker who is head of Central Office's treasurer's department,
which is responsible for finding donations, and are through him linked to
Lord Hambro, chairman of Hambros merchant bank and chairman of the party's
board of treasurers.
Broadly equivalent to the council secretaries are three Conservative
officials - in Edinburgh, Windsor and Newmarket - who raise money from
industrialists in their regions, where there are are no fundraising councils
as in other parts of the country.
These three are thought to raise a further Pounds 700,000 a year, making an
annual total of about Pounds 4m flowing to Central Office from the regions.
Of the seven secretaries - two cover five councils between them - four have
army backgrounds. The pattern of recruitment was set by Maj Gen Sir Brian
Wyldbore-Smith, director of the treasurer's department for 22 years until
1992, on the grounds, as he explained, that military people are 'considered
honest and amiable' and therefore get on well with executives. During Sir
Brian's tenure the treasurer's department raised Pounds 122m - worth about
Pounds 225m in today's money - from individuals and companies.
Most senior cabinet ministers have addressed at least one fundraising dinner
or lunch in recent years. Mr Peter Lilley, the social services secretary,
attended such a function last month at Manchester's St James's club as a
guest of the north-west council.
Mr John Major was the main guest at London's Cafe Royal in 1991 at a
function which attracted 250 people. This was organised by the City and
industrial liaison council, in effect the industrial council for London and
the south-east, whose activities in a normal year are expected to lead to
gifts of Pounds 1.5m. Ministers generally play a passive role, however. Few
have first-hand knowledge of who gives what.
The councils may clash with Tory constituency groups which can feel
aggrieved that cash from local industrialists is going to the party's head
office rather than helping its regional efforts. One of the party's
constituency party agents said councils and constituencies sometimes tried
to tap the same source. 'It's a question of who gets there first.'
Not every council member sees his - few women are involved - main role as
fundraising. Mr Grant Watson, a partner with Bristol surveyors Alder King
and until two years ago chairman of the south-west council, said: 'There
were some good social occasions. We had a lot of fun.'
Mr Peter Foden, chairman of Cheshire-based ERF truck maker and a member of
the north-west council for 25 years, said: 'The money doesn't buy favours,
just the opposite. Industry has had a rough few years.'
Most people in the network say raising money is getting more difficult. Mr
Tom Martin, chairman and part-owner of the Hull-based Arco clothing company
and a member of the North Yorkshire and Humberside Industrialists Council,
has through his company given the Tories more than Pounds 100,000 over 30
years.
He said: 'There is a great reluctance to cough up. The Conservatives will
have to do something more distinguished if they want to carry people with
them.'

FT  19 DEC 94 / Workers say main worry is the sack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER, Employment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Half of all employees feel their jobs are less secure than they were last
Christmas, says a survey of workplace opinion by the white-collar union MSF.
It says job security is the main concern in the workplace. The survey also
shows that nearly half of respondents think that they are treated badly by
their employer and stress at work is increasing.
Compared with three months earlier, 36 per cent said jobs in their workplace
were less secure. Significant increases in job fears were reported in
electronics, health and financial services. Nearly half of sales staff, 40
per cent of health workers and one-third of managers reported jobs as being
less secure.
The quarterly survey said 43 per cent described the treatment of staff in
their workplace as poor or very poor. Dissatisfaction with employers'
treatment of workers has increased, with 19 per cent saying it has become
worse since the last quarter.
The survey covers 426 private and public sector workplaces employing 140,000
workers. Just over half are in manufacturing.
Mr Roger Lyons, the union's general secretary, said: 'People are going into
the Christmas period not knowing if they will have a job in the new year.
More and more bosses seem to be using Ebeneezer Scrooge as a role model,
treating their employees with complete disdain.'

FT  19 DEC 94 / Insurance policy fraud 'cut by 25%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insurance companies have succeeded in cutting fraudulent claims by about 25
per cent in the past two years, says an Association of British Insurers
survey released yesterday.
The association calculates, however, that fraudulent claims, estimated at
Pounds 600m this year, still add about 4 per cent to the cost of insurance.
Mr Mark Boleat, director-general, said efforts at preventing fraud were 'now
beginning to pay off, with signs of a fall in the number and cost of
fraudulent claims. There is still some way to go and that is why further
anti-fraud initiatives can be expected from the insurance companies'.
Creditor insurance policies, which provide protection against unemployment
when goods are bought on credit, are most prone to fraud. For such policies
the cost of fraud is worth about 6 per cent of premiums. Household policies
are also vulnerable.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Jobs prospects 'best since 1990'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next year will open with the best first-quarter employment prospects since
1990, says a survey by Manpower, the employment services company.
Although manufacturers have replaced the service sector as the most
optimistic area of the economy, employers in the energy and water industries
are much more pessimistic.
The survey - based on responses from more than 2,000 employers - shows 18
per cent are forecasting job increases and 16 per cent forecasting job
losses, resulting in a positive net balance of 2 per cent. This compares
favourably with the balance of minus 3 per cent recorded for the first
quarter of this year, when 21 per cent of employers were predicting
increases.
Employers in retailing are particularly pessimistic about job prospects for
the first quarter, forecasting a balance of minus 24 per cent compared with
a net balance of minus 17 per cent when asked at the same stage last year.
Only 6 per cent of employers in the energy and water industries are
predicting increased job levels over the coming quarter, compared with 43
per cent forecasting a decrease, giving a balance of minus 37 per cent. This
is much more pessimistic than the net balance of minus 24 for the first
quarter of this year.
Manpower says the survey confirms the recovery is manufacturing-led, with 24
per cent of employers in the sector predicting an increase in job levels,
against 10 per cent forecasting a decrease.
Regionally, the outlook is far more positive than a year ago, with nine
regions forecasting job increases compared with just three last year.
The east Midlands is the most optimistic, forecasting a positive net balance
of 9 per cent, compared with a positive net balance of 3 per cent last year.
The north-west of England is also predicting a very marked improvement from
last year, with employers predicting a balance of 7 per cent next quarter,
compared with minus 20 for the first quarter of this year.
Only Scotland and the south of England are forecasting a worse position than
last year, although neither area is predicting net job losses.
Employers in the south recorded a positive net balance of 4 per cent,
compared with the 11 per cent forecast for the first three months of this
year.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Dockers meet brokers over shares bonanza
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the cabins and mess room of one of Britain's biggest ports this morning
two stockbrokers will address dockers, dredging crews and engineers on the
technicalities of a deal which could bring port employees windfalls of up to
Pounds 60,000 each.
The workers who will meet the Wise Speke stockbrokers in the next two days
are all shareholders in the Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority.
Powell Duffryn, part of the consortium which owns the authority's parent
company, Teesside Holdings, wants to take full control of the business and
has offered shareholder employees, who hold a 5 per cent stake, Pounds 18.17
a share.
Many of the 338 employee shareholders - from a workforce of 920 - obtained
their shares for Pounds 1.07 each nearly three years ago when Teesside
Holdings took over the authority. A number also received one free share for
each one they bought.
Powell Duffryn, which has launched a fully underwritten Pounds 70.7m rights
issue to fund the acquisition of the shares it does not own, seems virtually
certain to gain the 75 per cent acceptance it needs at extraordinary general
meetings in London and Middlesbrough after Christmas.
But it is anxious that authority worker-shareholders understand that if they
are to receive the Pounds 18.17 offered for each of their shares, holders of
75 per cent of the employees' shares must separately give their consent for
the articles of association of their Employee Benefit Trust to be changed.
Without this consent, which they must give individually by letter by January
9, their shares will continue to be locked into the Employee Benefit Trust.
This would cut them out of the Pounds 18.17 a share offer and allow them to
sell only at the dealing price, currently Pounds 2.98 a share.
In spite of this complexity Mr Jeff Gregory, Teesdock shift foreman, says
the stockbrokers will find a well-informed workforce.
He said: 'It's remarkable how the average working man can get pretty clued
up if it means money to him. You'd be very surprised how much the average
working person values money when they have the chance to get some.'
Mr Gregory, who holds 700 shares, says the employee shareholders are
'gearing up each other' to make sure apathy does not prevent the 75 per cent
vote for the trust's rule change. Most people are 'pretty chuffed' at the
prospect of making about Pounds 18,000 on average.
The only cloud, he said, had been the disgruntlement of those who did not
buy shares or, worse still, sold them within the last year for less than
Pounds 3 each.
Mr William Baker Baker, one of the Wise Speke stockbrokers giving the
dockside advice sessions, expects a high level of awareness. He expects most
discussion to centre on capital gains tax, since the alternative offer of
Powell Duffryn shares, rather than cash, offers the opportunity to avoid CGT
liability.
Mr Baker Baker said: 'One does go from the sublime to the ridiculous. From
the boardroom with its coats of arms to the dockers' cabin where the most
comfortable chair is in plastic.'
But, he added, 'you get a full and frank exchange at the A dock. And the
quality of the coffee's better there'.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Adams firm on weapons: Sinn Fein leader urges all-party
talks on demilitarisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, appeared last night to harden his
stance on the issue of decommissioning IRA weapons. He said the issue would
not be resolved in bilateral meetings between the government and his party.
On the eve of a second session of exploratory talks in Belfast between the
two sides, at which the issue of guns and explosives is likely to be raised
again, he said the process of demilitarisation could be addressed once the
talks moved to all-inclusive dialogue involving all the parties.
Mr Major has insisted that the IRA must give up its weapons before Sinn Fein
can enter full negotiations on the future of Ulster.
The Irish Republic's government is anxious not to let the issue delay the
peace process. Mr John Bruton, the new prime minister, said yesterday: 'It
is important to resolve this, not to get into a stand-off about it.'
Mr Adams said the existence of all armed groups, including the army and
loyalists, needed to be resolved by an effective demilitarisation process as
part of the overall settlement.
Meanwhile, the republic's new coalition government was yesterday embroiled
in an immediate controversy after Mr Albert Reynolds, the outgoing prime
minister, revealed details of confidential negotiations between London and
Dublin on the Northern Ireland peace process.
His comments drew criticism from the UK government, unionist MPs and
politicians in the republic.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, expressed surprise that
Mr Reynolds should breach the confidentiality of the negotiations and said
it would 'make things difficult for both sides'.
Mr Reynolds, interviewed on BBC Radio at the weekend, said London had agreed
that Dublin should have a role in future all-Ireland institutions covering
areas such as tourism and transport - a move northern unionists believe is a
step towards a united Ireland.
The former Irish prime minister, forced to resign over a judicial
appointment scandal last month, said an all-Ireland body would have
executive powers and be drawn from representatives in Dublin and a future
parliament in Northern Ireland.
Mr Reynolds said substantive talks involving British ministers and Sinn
Fein, the IRA's political wing, should begin now and troops should be taken
off the streets. He said Downing Street's precondition that weapons be
handed in or destroyed could seriously threaten the ceasefire.
Mr Reynolds said the all-Ireland body was among proposals in a new framework
document which London and Dublin hoped would form the basis for all-party
talks on the province's future. The document is due to be published early
next year and is expected to be discussed when Mr Major meets Mr Bruton next
week.

The Irish Republic's new coalition was yesterday embroiled in an immediate
controversy after Mr Albert Reynolds, the outgoing prime minister, revealed

Northern Ireland peace process.
His comments drew immediate criticism from the UK government, unionist MPs
and politicians in the republic.

Mr Reynolds also said substantive talks involving British ministers and Sinn

The document is due to be published early next year and is expected to be
discussed when Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, meets Mr John Bruton,
the republic's new prime minister, in London next week.
Mr Reynolds's comments are widely seen as a bid to sour Mr Bruton's
relations with the unionists and demonstrate to nationalists that it was the
outgoing Fianna Fail led coalition that had secured concessions on
cross-border bodies.
Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP, accused Mr Reynolds of 'destructive
dialogue' and seeking to weave a web of suspicion by giving the IRA the
impression that an 'embryo united Ireland' was within reach.
Mr Peter Robinson, East Belfast MP for the hardline Democratic Unionists,
called on Mr Major to provide 'the clearest clarification' of the state of
negotiations, warning the government that it was 'heading for confrontation'
with the unionist community in Northern Ireland.
British officials and Sinn Fein will meet for more exploratory dialogue at
Stormont today when the issue of guns and explosives is likely to be raised
again.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Granada in talks on soap opera deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Granada Television and Allied Domecq, the food and drinks group, are
believed to be close to agreement on a record television sponsorship deal
for Coronation Street, Granada's long-running soap opera.
Although no agreement has yet been signed a three-year deal worth a total of
about Pounds 30m is under negotiation.
Yesterday Granada would only say that it had been talking to a number of
groups about sponsorship of the 34-year-old series which can attract
audiences of up to 20m.
A deal with Allied Domecq, formally Allied Lyons, on such a scale would
almost certainly mean that a range of the company's brands would be
involved.
They include Domecq sherry, Tetley tea, Tetley beer, Castlemaine lager,
Dunkin Donuts and Baskin Robbins ice cream.
The Granada negotiations on sponsorship come at the same time that the ITV
company is trying to persuade the rest of ITV to pay more for Coronation
Street. There has been opposition to such a move.
The prospect of a lucrative sponsorship deal - which would almost certainly
depend on Coronation Street remaining on ITV - could weaken Granada's hand
in the negotiations with the ITV network.
Sponsorship money is divided up among the ITV companies according to their
share of advertising.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Blair warns against poll complacency after victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, yesterday warned his party's activists
that they need to make the British public more confident about voting for
them at the next general election if they are to defeat the Conservative
government.
His warning came as Mr John Major, the prime minister, gave an optimistic
view of his government's prospects in spite of further bitter criticism in
Tory ranks.
In the wake of Labour's record-breaking performance in the Dudley West
by-election last week Mr Blair adopted a highly cautious tone. He said that
Labour had actively to campaign to win votes rather than assume that Tory
disarray would bring down Mr Major's government.
Mr Blair said his party was 'ready and anxious' to govern and was enjoying
'a great renewal of confidence'.
But he declared himself 'utterly uncomplacent' about Labour's victory in the
Dudley West by-electin. He said that by-elections were not general elections
and there could be more than two years before the next dissolution of
parliament.
He told BBC Television's Breakfast with Frost: 'There is a long way to go in
electoral terms. We are ready to govern, we are anxious to govern. It's
frustrating not to be able to take on the government now.'
He added: 'We have got to make the British people sure of today's Labour
party - where we are, what we stand for, what we are going to deliver.'
Mr Major's upbeat comments about his government's prospects came in spite of
the continuing disarray in the Tory ranks over European integration and tax
cuts.
The prime minister admitted in an article in the News of the World that 'not
all has been rosy' in the Conservative administration in recent months.
But he said that the year had not been as tough for the government as people
had been led to believe. 'There is so much going on that is good that I
believe we end the year in credit,' he wrote.
Citing falling unemployment, the 'strongest programme ever' to cut crime and
the prospect of a doubling in living standards over the next 25 years, he
said he was proud of what was happening 'in this wonderful country'.
Other senior Tory figures were prepared to deliver harsh explanations of why
their party had done so badly at last week's by-election.
Mr Jeremy Hanley, the party chairman, was subjected to a blistering attack
from one senior Tory figure, who said that the Conservatives were now run
'by a man who is a pantaloon'.
Lord McAlpine, the former Tory deputy chairman, said Mr Hanley was 'totally
useless' at the job. He said in an article in the Mail on Sunday: 'He
believes that there is not a problem that cannot be solved with a slap on
the back.'
A cabinet minister also issued a blunt warning at the weekend to Tory MPs
who believed that an election victory could be assured by tax reductions in
next year's Budget.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the national heritage secretary, rejected suggestions
that a 'good old-fashioned pre-election boom' could win votes. He said that
'it would constitute a conscious decision to turn our backs on our most
important single achievement'.
He added: 'I can think of no better way to give the next general election to
Mr Blair on a silver platter.'

FT  19 DEC 94 / High Court to rule on BCCI payout plan today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The painstaking progress towards a settlement for the creditors' of the
failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International moves forward today at the
High Court in London.
The latest plan put forward by the UK-based liquidators, accountants Touche
Ross, must be cleared by the court before arrangements can be made for the
payment of an interim dividend to the creditors.
But success today will not remove all the obstacles facing the creditors.
The agreement has to be cleared by courts in three jurisdictions - the UK,
Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands. Any court decision may be subject to an
appeal.
So far the case has been heard in Luxembourg but a judgment is not expected
until January 12. The case comes before the courts in the Cayman Islands on
January 12 as well. Today's hearing in London is expected to last a day.
While appeals lodged in the UK courts or the Cayman Islands can be dealt
with relatively swiftly, an unsuccessful appeal in the Luxembourg court
could delay a payment to creditors by up to a year. A successful one would
derail the agreement.
An earlier creditors' plan had to be abandoned after a successful appeal was
granted by the Luxembourg court in October last year. The current plan, the
second offered to creditors, was designed to meet objections raised during
that appeal.
BCCI was shut down in 1991 with liabilities of up to Dollars 10bn following
the discovery of the world's biggest banking fraud. The bank's assets may
total up to Dollars 4bn. Estimates of the number of creditors worldwide
range up to 150,000.
Under the new agreement the Abu Dhabi government, the principal shareholder
of BCCI, will pay Dollars 1.55bn after the successful completion of the
court hearings, Dollars 150m 24 months later and Dollars 100m 36 months
after completion.
The eventual dividend to creditors was estimated shortly after the collapse
of the bank at between 30 per cent to 40 per cent and throughout the lengthy
process of finding an acceptable agreement most forecasts have kept within
that band.
However, the final offer could well be outside this range because of
unresolved legal actions linked to the bank's collapse and uncertainty over
the final level of claims by creditors - particularly those outside the UK
and Luxembourg.
Estimates of an interim dividend have been put at about 20 per cent. This is
based on creditors' claims of about Dollars 10bn and funds available to the
liquidators from the Abu Dhabi settlement and other sources.
The current plan received a boost when it was welcomed by the BCCI
Depositors Protection Association.
The association had been responsible for helping to block the original
offer. It said it wished to end the delays caused by appeals.
It also pointed out that the new agreement, unlike the original, allowed
creditors to pursue claims against the government of Abu Dhabi.
An appeal against the agreement is possible from a range of interested
parties. These include regulators, directors of the failed bank and former
employees, as well as individual creditors.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Figures on minimum wages and jobs released
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most leading market economies with national minimum wage laws achieved
higher employment growth rates than Britain in the past 14 years, the
Department of Employment has admitted.
The official government figures show that between 1980 and 1990 employment
grew 25.4 per cent in Australia, 18.4 per cent in the US, 12.9 per cent in
Japan and 7.3 per cent in Spain. This compares with 1.5 per cent in the UK.
The figures were provided in a parliamentary answer by the department to Mr
Denis MacShane, Labour MP for Rotherham.
Between 1990 and 1993, while there was a small net increase of 1.2 per cent
in the US employment growth rate and falls of 2.6 per cent in Australia and
5.9 per cent in Spain, there was a net decline of 4.6 per cent in Britain.
The employment department statistics appear to conflict with the
government's fundamental belief that the existence of national minimum wage
laws lead to job losses.
Mr MacShane said yesterday: 'No minister in the future should have the cheek
to stand up and tell the lie to the House of Commons that a legal minimum
wage is a job killer.'
He added, however, that while a legal minimum wage did not cost jobs, it
would do so if it was set at 'an absurdly high level close to national
average earnings'.
The Labour party is discussing what figure should be set for a national
minimum wage. Many union leaders believe it should be about Pounds 4 an hour
while a number of senior Labour MPs say that it should be closer to Pounds 3
an hour.
Mr MacShane said: 'The Tories think that their claim that a national minimum
wage in Britain would cost jobs is, in the words of their deputy chairman Mr
John Maples, a killer fact to be used against the Labour party. Now the
government's own figures show ministers have been lying.'
The employment department figures come as an embarrassment to Mr John Major
and his senior cabinet colleagues, who have continued to say in recent weeks
that the Labour party's general commitment to the introduction of a national
minimum wage would destroy employment in Britain.
Mr MacShane said last night: 'If other countries which have more dynamic
economies and better job creation records than the UK can have a national
minimum wage, it is high time that British workers enjoy one too.'

Trafalgar House, may be sued by holidaymakers denied a Christmas cruise on
the QE2, Alan Cane writes. About 300 passengers were turned away hours
before the liner set sail for New York on Saturday because of unfinished
plumbing in about 100 of the 950 cabins. The action led to scuffles and
chaos in the departure lounge. The QE2 returned from the Blohm and Voss
shipyard in Hamburg last week where it had been undergoing a Pounds 30m
refit. Sub-contractors had been working round the clock since the return to
complete refurbishments on time but without success. Neither Cunard nor
Trafalgar House could be contacted for comment last night. Reports suggest
the shipping line had been offering disappointed holidaymakers a full
refund, a free transatlantic cruise next year and Pounds 250 cash.

FT  19 DEC 94 / MP protests over lottery reports
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jack Straw, the shadow home secretary, is to lodge a formal complaint
with the Press Complaints Commission after three Sunday newspapers yesterday
identified the previous weekend's Pounds 17.8m National Lottery winner.
The winner's name was published in the News of the World, the Yorkshire on
Sunday and Birmingham's Sunday Mercury. Mr Straw is the MP for Blackburn
where the winner lived. He was one of several politicians who suggested that
unless the commission acted it would hasten the arrival of privacy laws.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Discounters' sales 'grow by 20%'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of non-food discount retailers are expected to have risen by 20 per
cent this year, far outstripping the growth of the rest of the retail
market, says retail research group Verdict.
Discounters, which sell at low prices and rely on large volumes, account for
Pounds 8bn sales, or about 8 per cent of non-food spending - compared with
22 per cent in the US. Verdict says a new generation of cut-price operators
is set to make the UK market resemble the US more closely.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Middle-class crisis identified
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Government mistakes and the 'feel-flat recovery' are breeding a dangerous
cynicism among the middle-classes, says a paper by the Social Market
Foundation.
The paper by Mr Matthew Symonds, a former Independent journalist, says that
the government's unpopularity can be traced to a growing 'culture of
anxiety' among middle-income voters. This, he argues, explains the lack of a
'feelgood' factor in the recovery to date. 'For 'feelgood', read 'feel
flat',' he says.
Mr Symonds adds: 'The middle classes feel a powerful sense of betrayal. They
feel that they have done all of the things they were asked to, and given
dutiful support to the orthodoxies of the 1980s and yet things have not
turned out well.'

FT  19 DEC 94 / Returning expats win tax ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Expatriates and other non-residents coming to live in Britain will no longer
be subject to tax on income from investments made offshore before they
arrived in the UK, Barbara Ellis writes.
The Court of Appeal ruled on Friday that section 739 of the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act, a wide-ranging anti-avoidance provision, is limited
to people resident in the UK at the time of investing offshore.
The Inland Revenue said it believed the potential loss of revenue would be
Pounds 18m.
The ruling came in a case in which the Revenue had pursued Professor Peter
Willoughby for income tax on income accumulating on a Royal Life (Isle of
Man) investment bond.
Prof Willoughby, who taught law at the University of Hong Kong for some
years before 1987, originally invested in the Isle of Man bond while
resident in Hong Kong. But he was living in the UK when the original bond
matured, and he reinvested in 1989 and 1990 in similar bonds. Prof
Willoughby, now resident in Alderney, was supported in the court action by
Royal Life.
Mr Chris Lintott, solicitor for Prof Willoughby, said the decision
overturned previous practice and interpretations of legislation which were
virtually unchanged since 1936.
The Revenue said it was considering a Lords appeal.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Stance on effect of new roads attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's approach to assessing the economic impact of its
roadbuilding programme will be challenged in a report to be published this
week.
A study by the Standing Advisory Committee on Trunk Road Assessment, an
independent group of experts, is expected to show that new roads generate
additional traffic as well as absorbing existing levels.
The government has argued at public inquiries into road schemes that new
roads do not generate additional traffic. Accepting that they do is likely
to increase resistance to its roadbuilding programme.
The committee delivered its report to the Department of Transport nearly
nine months ago but the department refused to publish it then. Environmental
lobbyists said this was because it was afraid of the impact it would have on
roadbuilding.
The willingness to publish the report is seen by some observers as a sign of
the 'greener' approach being taken by Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport
secretary for the past four months.
Previous studies have shown that new roads do generate more traffic. A
report published earlier this year by the British Road Federation showed
that 11 per cent of traffic carried on new roads was a direct result of the
road having been built.
The report of the advisory committee is expected to show a higher percentage
of journeys generated by new roads.
Environmentalists say this is a reason for not building new roads, because
levels of congestion rise. But the federation said that generated traffic
was a sign of increased economic activity and a positive benefit of
roadbuilding.
Mr Mawhinney will soon reveal further details of his roadbuilding programme.
There is expected to be a reduction in the number of motorway widening
schemes.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Service provides pension updates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Company finance directors are being offered a service which provides
immediate information on the assets and liabilities of their company pension
schemes.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm which has developed the service,
says much of the information on the state of a company's pension scheme is
out-of-date, sometimes by as much as three years, because it is based on the
triennial valuations of the fund's consulting actuary.
As a result a company may not be aware of looming deficiencies in its
pension fund which will eventually have an impact on the company's profit
and loss account.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand has developed a system which will give information on
pension funds on a monthly basis - or within hours if necessary - and
provide projections of its future performance.
It can also give up-to-date information on each employee's accrued pension
and its transfer value.
The accountancy firm's service is partly a response to the recent tightening
of pension regulations in the wake of the Robert Maxwell scandal, in which
Pounds 440m worth of pensioners' funds disappeared, and to new regulations
in the government's pension bill, published last week.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand said surpluses on many pension funds were being eroded
because of the lack of dividend growth on investments in the recession.
Mr Ralph Brereton, an actuary and pensions partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand in
Edinburgh who devised the system, said: 'Companies should treat their
corporate pension funds with the same attention as they would give to a
major subsidiary. Yet often they haven't a clue because their most recent
information is the triennial report of the consulting actuary.'
Mr Brereton said a number of companies recently discovered that their
pension funds were heading towards deficiency because they had continued a
holiday from contributing to the fund when this was no longer justified.
He said: 'Their forward cash planning for the rest of their business has
been screwed up because they are having to resume making contributions.'
Companies have to record pension contributions in their profit and loss
account, but these are based on the most recent actuarial valuation.
A statutory instrument in 1992 required companies to treat a deficit on
their pension fund as a debt to the employer. This followed the pension
scandal which broke after Robert Maxwell's death in 1991.
The pensions bill contains provisions requiring companies to spread their
pension costs over the working life of an employee, and to check annually
that the scheme would be solvent if it had to be wound up. It will forbid
them to overfund their schemes.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand pioneered its system, which it says is the only one of its
kind, in 1992, and started marketing it widely this autumn. It is studying
ways of providing the software to companies which manage their own schemes.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Coca-Cola market share falls below 50%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coca-Cola's share of the Pounds 670m UK cola market has fallen below 50 per
cent for the first time, say figures from Taylor Nelson AGB, the market
research group.
The figures - derived from AGB's panel of 8,500 consumers whose grocery
purchases are monitored electronically - show that Coca-Cola's market share
fell from 54.6 per cent in October to 42.2 per cent in the last week of
November.
That was shortly after the arrival of new colas from Mr Richard Branson's
Virgin group and supermarket chain Safeway, and six months after Classic
Cola was launched by J. Sainsbury, the UK's biggest food retailer.
AGB's figures highlight the threat posed to Coca-Cola, which has dominated
the market since its UK launch in 1921, by this year's new products - all of
which are manufactured by Cott, the Canadian soft drinks group.
Coca-Cola has begun a Pounds 4m advertising campaign which is a clear attack
on own-label and copycat brands. With the slogan 'All colas are not the
same', it shows a family attempting to buy Coca-Cola in a ghostly
supermarket manned by robot-like assistants selling own-label products only.
Mr Stephan Buck, a director of AGB, said: 'Coke's share has been coming down
to under 50 per cent on a long-term trend over the last year or so. But
there may be some initial trying of other new brands and they may not stand
the test of time. The key thing is whether people make repeat purchases.'
AGB's figures show Virgin Cola achieved a share of 8.7 per cent at the end
of November, with Safeway's Select Cola one of several brands which together
held 14.8 per cent of the market. Sainsbury's Classic had 12.2 per cent,
while Pepsi-Cola retained the second-biggest share with 20.1 per cent.
Coca-Cola said its UK sales increased 21 per cent in the third quarter of
this year, in spite of the competition.
Mr George Bradt, its new marketing director, said UK per-capita consumption
of cola was lower than in other countries and there was considerable scope
to expand the market.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Call for school science reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reforms of science teaching up to the age of 16 have failed to expand the
numbers taking the science A-level qualifications needed for university,
says a report published today.
Professor Alan Smithers and Dr Pamela Robinson of the University of
Manchester say in a report for the Engineering Council that the gap between
the new GCSE exams - taken at 16 - and A-levels has contributed to the fall
in the proportion of sixth-form students studying science.
The new arrangements for GCSE, which were introduced to implement the
national curriculum for England and Wales, allow for 'double-science'
entries.
In these pupils study all three science subjects in the time normally
allotted to two subjects. This was thought necessary to allow enough time in
school timetables for the other subjects made compulsory under the
curriculum.
This option has grown swiftly in popularity and now accounts for 82 per cent
of all GCSE entries compared with 22.3 per cent in 1989.
The proportion of 16-year-olds attempting any science subject has also risen
and last year stood at 83 per cent, a rise of 30 percentage points in four
years.
A-level science, which is still separated into specialist subjects, has
shown sharp falls in applications, however, with falls of 18.7 per cent in
physics and 8.1 per cent in chemistry over the same period.
The authors of the report suggest that A-levels should be reformed so that
five rather than three subjects become the norm. This would make it easier
to take two sciences as part of a broad curriculum, as is now possible at
GCSE.
A-level syllabuses would also start where GCSE ended.
They say separate recording of performance in biology, chemistry and physics
as part of the double-award GCSE would make it much easier for sixth-form
teachers to bridge the gap.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Debt-for-equity scheme criticised by accountants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Controversial plans announced in the Budget to explore ways of allowing
failed companies to swap their debt for equity have been attacked as flawed
by practitioners in the insolvency profession.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said that consultations would take place
on a scheme to establish 'a mechanism to help substitute equity for debt of
firms in administration or receivership'.
The deadline for comments on the proposal was last Wednesday.
Mr Ian Bradbery, president of the Society of Practitioners in Insolvency,
said: 'We have concluded that the proposals are flawed in principle, that
they could not work in practice, nor would they be in the creditors' best
interests.'
Under the proposals, which were originally contained in an academic paper
published in November last year, most company debt after a corporate
collapse would be wiped out and the equity placed with the senior creditor.
All other creditors would be ranked and offered options to buy share
capital.
Mr Bradbery said: 'We acknowledge that the authors' aim to maximise the
efficiency of insolvency processes and achieve best returns to creditors is
praiseworthy. However, we have difficulty in reconciling the workings of the
proposed scheme with the commercial realities of an insolvency situation.'
Professor Roger Gregory of accountants Touche Ross also attacked the
proposals, which some insolvency experts believe have won influential
government backing.
Prof Gregory, an expert in corporate recovery, said: 'One can see why the
chancellor is so delighted with this new idea - at the very moment when a
company goes bust it immediately and automatically becomes solvent. The
creditors are forced to capitalise the company to the extent of their debt.
These proposals do not appear to be just.'
Prof Gregory said that it might not be sensible to force everyone to swap
debt for equity. 'They are not equivalents - the life-blood of commerce is
money, not dodgy share certificates.'
He added: 'There is a further suggestion that the insolvency practitioner
may be required to make a market in the share capital options. The whole
thing looks to me like the apotheosis of junk marketing: If the debt proves
indigestible, let them eat shares.'

FT  19 DEC 94 / Israel reviews plan for stock market tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's cabinet yesterday reviewed controversial government plans to tax
stock market profits from January 1 as debate over economic policy widened.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, met key economic officials after
senior cabinet ministers launched a campaign to have the tax scrapped,
amended or postponed.
Since the unpopular capital gains tax was announced earlier this year
analysts say it has contributed to the continuing weakness on the Tel Aviv
Stock Exchange and calls have been growing in Mr Rabin's Labour party for it
to be abolished.
The Mistanim two-sided index has plunged almost 30 per cent from 240-250
points last year to a current level of 170-180 points and shows little sign
of a quick recovery. The continuing weakness of the market has placed severe
constraints on the government's privatisation programme and the ability of
private companies to raise capital.
The abolition campaign has been led by Mr Shimon Shetreet, economics
minister, who has argued the tax is a big factor in Labour's recent decline
in the opinion polls. A recent Gallup poll showed that 36 per cent of those
polled opposed the tax while 32 per cent supported it. The same poll showed
58 per cent of investors in the stock market wanted the tax scrapped.
Mr Shetreet has called the tax 'absurd and draconian' and said it would hurt
the small investor most. The right-wing Likud opposition party has also
condemned it. A private member's bill to scrap it was defeated 36-26 in
parliament last week.
Mr Abraham Shochat, minister of finance, has warned that any attempt to
abolish the tax would send negative signals to investors about government
economic policy. He says the tax brings Israel into line with other
countries and will be structured to allow deduction of losses, and has
strongly criticised opposition to the measure based on political
considerations. General elections are due in November 1996.
'Zigzagging on the issue, speculating as to what will happen in 1996, and
flinching because of political intrigue and fears, all mean fleeing
responsibility,' he said last week. 'The leadership of a country is
evaluated according to its determination, its backbone and its
trustworthiness. Popularity ratings and political intrigues should not
determine what needs to be done.'
The tax has been strongly supported by Mr Jacob Frenkel, Bank of Israel
governor. However many Labour members feel Mr Rabin is open to persuasion
and could agree to postpone its implementation or amend it.
The debate over the tax comes amid wider discussion on economic policy. Mr
Micha Harish, industry minister, has warned of recession in 1996 unless the
government more resolutely tackles inflation, running at 14 per cent, high
interest rates and an overvalued shekel.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Scramble for Shanghai's prime sites: The authorities'
disposal of the city's majestic waterfront properties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bangkok Bank is renovating No 7, the Bund, Banque Indosuez has signed a
letter of intent to purchase No 29, and the Bank of China is repurchasing
its old headquarters next to the Peace Hotel.
After a hiatus of more than a year, the Shanghai municipality is moving on
the disposal of the majestic properties on the city's waterfront, the Bund.
The Shanghai Stock Exchange has indicated an interest in purchasing the most
prominent landmark on the waterfront - the former headquarters of the
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. The SSE's expression of interest may prompt a
bidding contest, as Hongkong Bank itself is keen to move back into its
27,000 sq m premises, now used as the mayor's office and communist party
headquarters.
The establishment of the Shanghai Bund Buildings Function Transformation
Corporation has created a vehicle for the sale of 37 properties in an area
the Chinese have taken to describing as Asia's Wall Street, although a
revolution in the financial sector will be necessary to realise the dream of
restoring the Bund to its former glory.
At the same time, across the Huangpu River, on the east bank, work is
advancing on creating a separate 'finance district' that will be linked with
the Bund by underground railway, pedestrian tunnels, and bridges to create a
central business district of Shanghai.
Mr Zhang Zhe, vice general manager of the Shanghai Lujiazui Finance and
Trade Zone Development Company, is confident that marriage between the old
and the new can be effected to the advantage of both. 'The two banks of the
Huangpu can help each other and pull each other forward,' he says.
Lujiazui Development was formed in 1992 to develop a 1.51 sq km site in the
Pudong development zone, including 69 buildings, among them offices of
China's big specialised banks, insurance companies and investment
corporations. A new securities exchange is also under construction, and
space is being set aside for residential facilities. Mr Zhang estimates
development costs for the site, including buildings and infrastructure will
run to about Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn). Of this, Dollars 1bn has already
been committed. Twelve buildings are actually under construction, and 20 are
in the advanced planning stage.
The Lujiazui finance and trade zone, as the financial district will be
known, will be dominated by three skyscrapers, including a Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation structure rising 88 floors.
If the planners' dreams are realised, one of Asia's more remarkable
developments will rise from marshy ground in place of a gaggle of decaying
godowns, crumbling houses and the odd paddy field.
Western bankers in Shanghai welcome plans to create a central business
district spanning the Huangpu and envisage no great problems in the city
creating a business core bisected by a big waterway. The Huangpu, which runs
into the Yangtze near its mouth, accommodates an enormous amount of shipping
traffic.
Mr Fiepko Klug, chief representative in China of Banque Indosuez, sees no
reason why the 'heart of the city' should not span the Huangpu 'like the
left and right bank in Paris'.
But in common with his colleagues from other banks interested in returning
to their homes on the Bund, Mr Klug is extremely circumspect about prospects
of securing their old properties, and even more reticent on the issue of
price.
Banque Indosuez, he says, has signed a letter of intent which is no more at
this stage than an indication of an intention to discuss re-acquisition. 'We
would see our return to the Bund as an indication of confidence in the
development of Shanghai and in the future of China,' he says, 'but the final
decision has to be taken on the basis of price.'
Other organisations such as Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, eyeing their former
Bund properties covetously, are even less forthcoming.
Mr Richard Graham, chief representative in Shanghai of Baring Securities,
said there were 'political sensitivities' over the prospect of companies
such as Hongkong Bank returning to their former 'hunting lodges' on the
Bund, from which they were unceremoniously ousted after the 1949 revolution.
Hongkong Bank is said to have been asked to pay between Dollars 150m and
Dollars 200m for its former headquarters, but there is also no doubt that
the symbolic value of acquiring the property would be almost incalculable.
However, Mr Wei Wenyuan, general manager of the Shanghai Stock Exchange,
said its present location was insufficient for its fast-growing business.
The SSE is at present operating from a converted former hotel, but is
building a new exchange in the Pudong area. According to a Chinese news
agency report, the SSE wants the old Hongkong Bank site to 'get a foothold
on the Bund, which is to become the symbol of Shanghai as an international
financial centre'.
While the larger western institutions continue to play a game of cat and
mouse with the Shanghai authorities over price and leasehold terms, a Thai
bank has quietly stolen a march. The Bangkok Bank signed a 30-year lease in
October, 1993 on No 7 and renovations are well under way.
Mr Chalit Tayjasanant, chief representative in China, said negotiations with
the owner, Chang Jiang Shipping, had been completed in a 'few months'.
Facilitating the sale was the fact that the building was solely owned by the
shipping company, avoiding ownership complications afflicting other
properties.
For most of the properties, the owner is the municipality, and complex
commercial and political considerations involved in the sale of these
historic sites have weighed heavily. Delays are attributable in part to an
argument within the local government over the best means of disposal  -
whether by auction, tender or private treaty.
One awkward issue not being addressed in talks on re-acquisition, at least
not publicly, is the curious happenstance that the former owners are being
obliged to lease back, for substantial sums, properties that belonged to
them in the first place.

FT  19 DEC 94 / China warns over debts bail-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chinese officials at the weekend sought to distance the government from
responsibility for debts incurred by state-owned companies following reports
in the international media about difficulties over payments.
At the same time, Beijing has hit back at what it regards as negative
foreign reports about China's investment climate. Strong official criticism
of recent western reporting indicates growing sensitivity to stories that
affect China's credit rating and confidence in China as a safe investment
destination.
Mr Liu Zhiben, director general of the foreign investment division of the
Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation Ministry (Moftec), charged that the
'flimsy linkage of corporate disputes to the government's credibility is a
thinly veiled attempt to mar the image of China as an investment magnet'.
But Mr Liu also warned foreign investors that they could not take for
granted a government bail-out of projects that had gone sour. Mr Liu told
Business Weekly newspaper: 'Some investors are fond of the idea that doing
business with Chinese state-owned companies means gaining a secure link with
the Chinese government - a link that could come in handy if the state-owned
Chinese investment partner suffers losses.
'But the reality of the arrangement is different. For many years, Chinese
enterprises, whether state, collectively or privately-owned, have had to
sink or swim on their own. The days of rigid central planning and
responsibility for state firms has gone.
'It's not strange to see contractual conflicts. However, these cannot be
regarded as anything relating to government action.'
In the past few weeks, China's reputation as a reliable business partner has
been buffeted by three high-profile cases.
These involve a dispute with Lehman Brothers, involving prominent state
corporations, about losses of Dollars 100m (Pounds 64m) on currency trading;
an argument with the London Metals Exchange over Dollars 30-Dollars 40m in
trading losses incurred by the China International Trust and Investment
Corporation (Citic); and the non-payment by state enterprises of Dollars
500-Dollars 600m to joint venture leasing companies.
Western banks and credit agencies have stepped up their monitoring of the
credit performance of Chinese organisations in the light of these
developments.
Concern about the ability of Chinese enterprises to meet their obligations
to foreign creditors is leading to an increase in borrowing costs for
Chinese institutions.
China's foreign debt is expected to reach Dollars 100bn this year. This will
mean a debt-service ratio of around 12 per cent. About two-thirds of China's
debt is sovereign: in other words, government-guaranteed.
China's state auditors have been instructed to investigate foreign debts of
local authorities as part of attempts by Beijing to tighten the screws on
foreign borrowing.
Business Weekly reported that the State Audit Administration would monitor
commercial loans obtained by provincial governments.
A spokesman for the SAA said that 'few foreign loans to local government
have been audited in the past few years as it had been focusing on projects
financed by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and other
international organisations.'

FT  19 DEC 94 / Taiwan's China-watchers weigh risks of closer links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Will smiling Siew take off the white gloves?' asks a headline in
yesterday's Independence Evening Post in Taiwan.
The respected liberal daily refers to the island's intricate arm's-length
pas de deux with China. Mr Vincent Siew, renowned for his ever-present grin,
was put in charge of shaping the island's policy toward its giant neighbour
and ostensible rival in a cabinet reshuffle last week.
The question embodies both the hopes and dreads of Taiwanese, who find
themselves variously fearing an invasion by the People's Liberation Army,
dreaming of a return to the ancestral fold and planning how to plunder the
El Dorado of the orient.
It also reflects the chief fear of many ordinary Taiwanese: that of being
involuntarily absorbed by China, which views Taiwan as a rebellious province
and threatens to use force if the island should formally declare
independence. Most countries accept Beijing's view and do not accord
diplomatic recognition to Taipei.
'Given Siew Wan-chang's background in trade and economics, in the future,
cross-strait commerce will take precedence over politics, and some people
find this disturbing,' the article says. During his previous brief as
economic planning minister, Mr Siew drafted a plan to transform the island
into a regional business hub. Press reports suggest that he has been brought
in to head the Mainland Affairs Council to carry out that plan.
The missing link - literally - in Taiwan's grand ambition to become a
regional centre for business, finance and transport is direct shipping and
flights to China, banned by Taipei since the Kuomintang government fled to
the island after losing China's civil war in 1949. Businessmen who have
investments in China and are forced to travel back and forth via Hong Kong
see things differently from the average Taiwanese.
In a Sunday editorial, the Commercial Times, a financial daily which broadly
supports government policy,wrote in favour of the Economic Planning
Ministry's suggestion to create an 'offshore transport centre' which would
be used to establish direct shipping and air links with China.
'From an economic point of view, direct cross-strait transport would save
time and money and promote development of two-way trade and economic
development on both sides,' the paper argued.
The pro-government China Times, in an editorial published yesterday, said
the ruling Kuomintang would be likely to step up economic ties with China,
possibly opening direct links, in order to gain support in crucial
legislative elections late next year and first-time presidential elections
slated for early 1996.
'The iron votes have rusted,' the paper said in a reference to the loss of
once loyal supporters to opposition parties. 'Faced with upcoming elections.
. . what other more effective card does the ruling party have to play?'
But in a letter published last week in the United Daily News, which is seen
as being more closely aligned with the Kuomintang faction whose members came
from China in 1949, a Shanghai-based Taiwanese businessman wrote: 'Many
people believe that Taiwanese businessmen support direct links, but actually
that is not so. If direct links were opened tomorrow. . . like a magnetic
force, Taiwan would be swallowed alive.'
But the issue of direct links will become, in practical terms, a moot point
in 2 1/2 years in any case, as the Economic Daily News hinted in an
editorial last week. 'The 1997 deadline for Hong Kong is forcing us closer
by the day. In the past we could avoid dealing with the direct links issue.
. . but soon we will be compelled to face (China) directly,' the paper
warned. The British colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Solution sought on copper trading losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The China International Trust and Investment Corporation said yesterday it
was committed to a 'reasonable solution' in its dispute with London Metals
Exchange copper traders and other creditors over non-payment of copper
trading losses totalling Dollars 30m-Dollars 40m.
In Citic's first detailed comment on the dispute, which dates back to early
this year, a spokesman attributed the problems to dealers associated with
the organisation's Shanghai branch acting without the knowledge or authority
of Citic itself.
Mr Xu Xiwei, a senior adviser to Citic Shanghai, said two dealers and two
managers, including the former president, had been charged with corruption
and detained.
The Citic official, however, did not commit the organisation to a
settlement.
The official said that this would depend on the outcome of meetings to be
held soon in London.
But he noted that Citic Shanghai was 'an independent legal entity under the
law of China' and was therefore responsible for its own profits and losses.
Mr Xu said an international accounting firm had been entrusted with
responsibility for investigating the losses and suggesting solutions. 'I
sincerely hope all parties concerned will find a reasonable solution through
friendly consultation,' Mr Xu said.
He blamed creditors, including western banks, for lax procedures in their
efforts to assist Citic Shanghai to overcome its trading losses.
'I must regretfully point out that certain foreign counterparts have got
some screws loose in their own house,' he said. 'In other words, what they
have done has to some extent assisted such a thing happening unintentionally
or intentionally.'
Mr Xu said that credit had been extended to Citic's Shanghai branch
equivalent to 'five or six times' equity. This was done without notifying
Citic headquarters, let alone requiring any guarantee from Citic.
'Any counterpart, if he is prudent, should have related extension of credit
to Citic Shanghai's capacity and in line with China's relevant laws and
regulations governing foreign exchange.'

FT  19 DEC 94 / Eritrea struggles to rebuild as aid meeting begins: Pledges
by donors are likely to be generous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eritrea, Africa's newest nation, will hold its first donors' conference with
the World Bank and western governments in Paris today and present its
masterplan for rebuilding a country emerging from more than a quarter
century of civil war.
'Our global needs are tremendous,' Mr Haile Woldensai, Eritrea's finance
minister, said yesterday, declining however to place a figure on Eritrea's
aid requirements.
'Every sector of the economy was affected by the war, but we also want to be
realistic and take into account the financial constraints of the donor
community.'
The Eritrean People's Liberation Front has been running the Red Sea state
since it defeated the Ethiopian occupation forces in May 1991 following a
30-year liberation war. But Eritrea only became a fully-fledged sovereign
state after a referendum on independence from Ethiopia in May 1993.
It took another year before it could join the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, hence the delay in seeking international
assistance for its reconstruction efforts.
Government officials such as Mr Haile still work without pay. So do the
teams of navvies - former combatants awaiting demobilisation - who have been
rebuilding the bomb-damaged port of Massawa and the country's few
dilapidated roads.
In the countryside, villagers trek for miles to build small dams and stone
terraces on food-for-work projects.
Millions of tree seedlings are being grown in nurseries, ready for planting
to help fix the soil on the eroded hillsides.
The donor community is impressed by the single- minded tenacity with which
Eritreans have gone about the task of forging a new nation. The aid pledges
at the Paris meeting are expected to be generous.
But Eritrea, which inherited no external debt upon independence (President
Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia, himself a former guerrilla fighter, agreed to
shoulder the debt obligations of his country's former province), is wary of
falling into the trap of aid dependence which afflicts the rest of the
continent.
'We want to establish a new approach between donors and the recipient
country,' Mr Haile said. 'Development programmes and priorities should be
established by Eritreans, not by the donor community.'
The Eritrean government has welcomed offers of international assistance, but
it is less keen on accepting the legions of highly-paid foreign consultants
who roam around Africa.
A recent offer by the Italian government to rebuild the railway linking
Massawa to the capital, Asmara, at a cost of Dollars 85m (Pounds 54m), was
politely turned down.
President Isayas Afewerki told the Italians Eritrea would rebuild the
railway on its own. The first new sleepers were laid last month.
There are few illusions, however, over the scale of the task which faces the
new government.
Even after three years of peace, Eritrea cannot feed itself. It depends on
international donations to meet the needs of 1.5m people - half of the
population.
A further 500,000 Eritreans are awaiting repatriation from refugee camps in
neighbouring Sudan - a country with which Eritrea severed diplomatic
relations two weeks ago because of Khartoum's alleged training of Eritrean
Islamic insurgents.
Nevertheless, foreign investors, led by the US and Israel, are showing an
interest in Eritrea now that a foreign investment code and property and land
rights have been established.
Several US oil companies, including Mobil, Amoco and Hunt, are negotiating
oil exploration contracts for the shallow waters off Eritrea's Red Sea
coast.
Israel hopes to start fishing operations soon after a 30-year break, while
Middle East and German concerns are already negotiating for licences.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Leadership of ANC admits party disarray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BLOEMFONTEIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The top leadership of the African National Con-gress has ack-nowledged that
the party is in organisational disarray and was unprepared for the demands
of becoming the dominant partner in South Africa's government of national
unity.
In his official report to the ANC's triennial conference in Bloemfontein
yesterday Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general, said the party had not
sufficiently prepared itself for dealing with the bureaucratic tasks of
government. As a result, the slow flow of new legislation, combined with
ineffective policy implementation by a recalcitrant bureaucracy, had delayed
delivery on the party's election promises.
In a well-received address to 3,000 ANC delegates from around the country,
Mr Ramaphosa also admitted that the party's paid-up membership had dropped
off sharply following the April election, and that unmet debts incurred
during the election campaign had led to the use of fewer full-time party
officers. However, he said he expected the conference to agree on a new
membership structure to help combat this as well as cutting the excessive
workload for top party officials.
The admissions are an acknowledgement by the ANC of some grassroots
dissatisfaction with the slow pace of change since it came to power
following the country's April elections.
Still, the conference seems likely to accept a proposed strategy document
presented yesterday by deputy President Thabo Mbeki, which puts forward a
generally moderate political line and calls for a national consensus on
economic policy centred around opening the South African market to increased
trade and capital flows to boost local investment and productivity.
However the wide-ranging document notes that, while the ANC needs to improve
its standing among whites, its primary focus should be the needs of the
country's black community. It also says that the bureaucracy, army and
police force should be rapidly transformed to make them more representative
in terms of both race and gender and more accountable to government.
Both Mr Ramaphosa and Mr Mbeki's speeches followed the line set in President
Nelson Mandela's opening address to the five-day conference on Saturday,
when he admitted that the pace of change had been slow, but insisted there
were no short-term solutions to the entrenched problems South Africa faces.
'Ours is not a programme of quick handouts but one for serious and lasting
transformation,' he said.
Mr Mandela also went out of his way to defend the ANC's commitment to fiscal
discipline and economic reform against radicals calling for faster change.
He insisted that such policies were 'neither luxuries nor requirements
foreign to the ANC's own policies', stressing that they represented the best
way of achieving sustainable growth.
In this light, Mr Mandela said that given the difficulties of governance and
delivery, the ANC should make more of an effort to explain to people the
reasons behind unpopular decisions. 'This is the best antidote to attempts
by opportunists of all hues to gain popularity on the basis of
radical-sounding but impractical propositions,' he said.
The president reiterated that one of the main obstacles facing the
government's economic programme was the preponderance of economic power in
white hands. This, he said, led to 'attempts to discourage new entrants and
foreign investors because the cartels overcharging society fear
competition'.

Former US president Jimmy Carter yesterday began his peace mission to Bosnia

visit got under way, defeated Bosnian-government troops were withdrawing
from Velika Kladusa, a strategic town in the north-western Bihac pocket
which fell to Serb and renegade Moslem forces.
After meeting President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, Mr Haris Silajdzic, the
Bosnian prime minister, and UN officials, in the Croatian capital Zagreb, Mr
Carter left for Sarajevo amid tight security. Earlier yesterday four
rocket-propelled grenades exploded near a UN anti-sniping team in the city
centre, slightly wounding a peacekeeper and a civilian. Today Mr Carter is
to meet Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, in Pale, the Serb
mountain stronghold above Sarajevo.

<TEXT>
Mr Mario Conde, former chairman of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), is to
be questioned today by a Madrid high court judge who on Friday ordered the
imprisonment of Mr Arturo Roman, the bank's former deputy chairman.
Mr Roman was arrested and refused bail by Judge Manuel Garca Castellon after
two days of questioning in connection with a fraud probe into the banking
group, which collapsed a year ago. Legal officials said the questioning
centred on about Pta5bn (Pounds 24.3m) allegedly gained by fraud from
Banesto shareholders. A flamboyant celebrity symbol of Spain's booming late
1980s, when he became a billionaire, Mr Conde was indicted on fraud charges
last month. He became chairman of Banesto in 1987, and was dismissed by the
Bank of Spain last December, together with his fellow Banesto directors,
after an official inspection discovered the banking group had overvalued its
Pta7,000bn assets by Pta503bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Iberia, Spain's embattled state-owned flag carrier, inched closer to
bankruptcy over the weekend when its pilots' union said they would strike
over the peak holiday period between December 28 and January 8.
The pilots have rejected a viability plan backed by Iberia's other unions to
salvage the crippled airline. The plan involved pay cuts of 15 per cent for
the pilots, and their union said it was only prepared to negotiate salary
cuts if Iberia's management was replaced. The confrontation means the
management may introduce a more drastic restructuring plan involving
large-scale redundancies among the airline's 25,000 labour force and the
sale of some of its subsidiaries.
Iberia, which has debts of Pta424bn (Pounds 2.06bn) half of which are short
term, has written off accumulated losses of Pta144bn, reducing its capital
and reserves to a mere Pta69bn. The airline is on course to lose Pta44bn
this year and the company said yesterday the pilots' strike would cost
Iberia at least Pta10bn in lost revenue.

FT  19 DEC 94 / BAT nears American Tobacco takeover consent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries, the British tobacco and financial services group, looks well
placed to win a US court's consent this week for its planned Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 600m) takeover of American Tobacco, the fifth biggest US cigarette
maker.
Over the past two weeks the US Federal Trade Commission has been arguing in
a New York court that the takeover should be blocked on competition grounds
because BAT already owns Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco, the third biggest US
cigarette maker.
The case closed last Wednesday with the judge reserving his decision, so
neither side yet knows the outcome. But lawyers for the Federal Trade
Commission acknowledge that BAT seems to have come out ahead.
Mr Merlin Orlans, who represented the FTC during the hearing, said that the
judge had clearly not been disposed towards the FTC's arguments.
During the hearing, the FTC argued that the US tobacco industry was already
highly concentrated because it had only six participants. If two of the
participants combined, the FTC said, competition would be further reduced
and it would become easier for the remaining participants to raise prices.
BAT countered that a merger of Brown &amp; Williamson with its 11 per cent
market share and American Tobacco with its 7 per cent share would increase
the combined company's ability to compete with Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds
Tobacco, the two industry giants, which together account for 70 per cent of
US cigarette sales.
The FTC appeared to start the proceedings with a strong case, but as the
hearing progressed, it became evident from Judge Milton Pollack's grilling
of key FTC witnesses that he was far from convinced by the FTC's arguments.
Judge Pollack is thought likely to announce his decision tomorrow or
Wednesday. But the FTC and BAT may yet reach a settlement before then under
which the FTC would drop its opposition to the takeover.
For the FTC, a compromise would be better than an outright defeat. For BAT,
an agreement would eliminate the likelihood that the FTC, if defeated, would
further delay the takeover by lodging an appeal.
One compromise that the FTC and BAT are understood to have considered would
involve an agreement by BAT that it would shed an American Tobacco factory
and some its brands if the takeover went ahead.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Difficult choices ahead for Mercosur: Trade quartet must
decide on direction after euphoria of pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Late-night summits often spawn hyperbole and talk of breakthrough, but the
upbeat statements coming out of the colonial Brazilian town of Ouro Preto
this weekend have a basis in fact.
The Mercosur trade group of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay agreed
to become a customs union from January 1. The decision, an idea which four
years ago was dismissed by many as politically inspired and wishful
thinking, will create the world's second largest customs union, linking
economies with a combined GDP of about Dollars 800bn (Pounds 490bn) and 200m
consumers.
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's president-elect, described the
agreement as a 'historic landmark', while President Carlos Menem of
Argentina said its effects would be 'highly positive' for the four
countries' economies. Both men marvelled at the achievement, remarkable
given that relations between Brazil and Argentina have until recently been
poor and that their economies for decades encouraged protectionism.
Despite the celebrations, some difficult choices lie ahead. The partners
must decide whether to push on towards a common market with free movement of
labour and capital, or whether to concentrate on leading South America's
integration with Nafta in the planned Free Trade Area of the Americas
(FTAA). Mercosur's success also threatens to concentrate investment in the
richer areas of Brazil and Argentina, two countries which already suffer
from dangerous differences in regional wealth.
According to diplomats, the catalyst for agreement was the decision to allow
sensitive and less competitive products temporary exemptions from the free
trade regime. For trade between the four countries, where tariffs have been
falling since 1991, less than 10 per cent of trade will get the special
exemptions. However, these products, ranging from Argentine paper to
Brazilian peaches, will have their tariffs reduced to zero by 1999.
With the common external tariff (CET) covering trade with countries outside
the area, less than 10 per cent of products will have an exemption from the
tariff. In these cases, governments have until 2001 to apply the CET, whose
average rate for all products is 14 per cent. Two sensitive areas, cars and
sugar, will also be excluded until the next century.
A second important reason for agreement was the recent, and still fragile,
economic recovery of Brazil, which has seen its monthly inflation rate fall
from 50 per cent in June to less than 3 per cent this month because of a new
currency, the Real.
Now the four countries must decide how much further to go. The Protocol of
Ouro Preto, which gives Mercosur a legal status and lets it negotiate with
other trade groups such as the European Union, also commits the partners to
review by 2001 whether they want a full common market. Predicting the
outcome is difficult, especially since Argentina holds presidential
elections next year, and Brazil in 1998.
Until the review, the two main partners are determined to limit the growth
of Mercosur's institutions. A Uruguayan proposal to establish a
supranational court to rule on trade disputes was opposed by Brazil and
Argentina, which feared their sovereignty would be diluted. Mercosur's
secretariat will remain a small, administrative organ, and policy and
decisions will remain with the four governments.
Despite these intentions, however, closer integration is likely to lead to
stronger Mercosur institutions and devolved sovereignty.
In place of a court, the countries agreed over the weekend to set up an
arbitration tribunal. A Brazilian-Argentine proposal to merge their
automotive industrial policies by 2000 also implies the ceding of national
interests to those of Mercosur.
Mercosur officials talk of the next few years as a time of 'deepening'
integration. But an important distraction is the 2005 deadline for a
continent-wide free trade area, which was agreed at the recent Summit of the
Americas and which will involve a convergence of existing trade blocs like
Mercosur, Nafta and the Andean Pact countries.
Mercosur has already opened talks with Chile and Bolivia about their joining
the free trade area rather than becoming customs union members. took care to
send a high-level observer to the Ouro Preto. meeting, presumably to prove
his determination for Chile to join both Mercosur and Nafta.
Mercosur is the natural negotiating partner for Nafta, especially if
relations continue to improve between the two biggest countries, the US and
Brazil. However, there are real limits to Mercosur's further expansion. Some
countries such as Venezuela want to establish links, principally to reduce
their reliance on US trade. But Caracas is closer to Miami than Mercosur's
main crescent, between Sao Paulo state in Brazil and Buenos Aires.
The expanse, and poor communications, of the Amazon are also a barrier to
further integration between north and south of South America.

Russia has overcome long-standing reservations and joined 45 other nations
in signing a European Energy Charter designed as the single most important
instrument for stimulating the integration of former eastern bloc economies
into the world market. However, the US declined to sign the treaty in Lisbon
on Saturday, mainly because it considers the charter fails to guarantee
adequate protection for investors and falls below standards already obtained
by the US in bilateral and other multilateral investment agreements. The
treaty provides free and equal access to energy markets among the
signatories.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Road ahead for Irish premier well signposted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Bruton, Ireland's new premier, has a boyish candour which often
makes him seem out of place in the wheeler-dealing atmosphere of Irish
politics.
Yet, after his more than 20 years in the Dail, there are few politicians
with a more acute knowledge of the workings of parliament. At 47, and with a
wealth of ministerial portfolios under his belt, the real question is
whether he has the qualities of diplomacy and political toughness that
Ireland needs at this watershed in its history.
Ireland is entering uncharted waters. The Northern Ireland peace process is
at a critical juncture as paramilitaries enter exploratory talks with UK
officials and unionists await the publication of the important joint
framework document which London and Dublin hope will form the basis for
all-party talks on Ulster's future.
Mr Bruton will enter the process at the head of an uneasy coalition of
conservative and radical elements led by Fine Gael, an essentially
conservative party, and including Labour, the party of modern European
secular politics, and the Democratic Left, the successor of the Official
IRA.
Personality problems may resurface. Mr Bruton believes he was let down when
Mr Dick Spring, leader of the Labour party, went into coalition with Fianna
Fail in 1992. The two politicians also squabbled over economic policy in the
last Fine Gael-Labour coalition, which fell in 1987.
Today one key difference is that not only is there a shared determination to
keep Fianna Fail out of office, but the economy's strength will make
decisions on sensitive issues like public spending less divisive.
Mr Bruton's first task is to assert control over his own party machine. A
challenge in the short term is unlikely but any slip could precipitate one.
The policy objectives are well signposted. On Northern Ireland, Mr Bruton's
team will have to pick up where the outgoing government left off, while
stamping its own character on the peace process. How he will balance the
need to keep hardline republicans harnessed to the peace process, without
compromising his sympathies for the northern unionists, is difficult to see.
In a deliberately low-key acceptance address to the Dail last week, Mr
Bruton stressed his greatest concern was to see progress sustained. If the
outgoing administration secured the peace, he said, his task would be to
foster the 'reconciliation' of the island's two religious traditions.
In the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation on Friday, his first meeting with
Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein (the IRA's political wing), provided
little more than a cursory handshake. Few believe Mr Bruton can replicate
the rapport Fianna Fail enjoyed with the republicans.
Fine Gael, historically identified as the party which voted for the
Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 which enshrined partition, is still not
comfortable with Sinn Fein.
But in Mr Prionsias De Rossa, Democratic Left leader, Mr Bruton will have a
useful ally. A former IRA internee, Mr De Rossa provides ample evidence of
the benefits that accrue to those republicans who abandon the bullet in
favour of the ballot box.
On social questions like divorce and abortion there is more common ground
between the parties.
Mr Bruton campaigned in favour of legalising divorce when it was last put to
a referendum in 1986. All three parties seem agreed it may be over-ambitious
to contemplate winning backing in a referendum substantive reforms
legalising abortion, although there may be a good chance of passing
legislation on an abortion information bill allowing women to be referred by
doctors to specialists outside Ireland.
Perhaps the area where there will be most strain will be on the economy. Mr
Bruton's Fine Gael is the party of low taxation and tight spending. Labour
and the more radical Democratic Left will want to take a more Keynesian
approach, injecting spending into the economy to create jobs and reduce the
burden of poverty for the lower paid and unemployed.
Mr Bruton's first test is to see a new budget through parliament. Democratic
Left, in charge of the big spending social welfare portfolio, is expected to
push for a mildly expansionary budget in an attempt to ease unemployment.
Mr Bruton's budget record is far from convincing. In 1982, when he was
finance minister in Dr Garret Fitzgerald's coalition, his attempts to impose
VAT on child clothing and shoes was opposed by independents. This led to the
defeat of his budget, and eventually the coalition's downfall.

FT  19 DEC 94 / US seeks closer economic ties with EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US has proposed a stronger economic and trade partnership with the
European Union, aimed at curbing the growth of subsidised export financing
and co-ordinating policies more closely towards Japan, China and big
emerging markets in the developing world.
According to a senior administration official, the proposal is intended to
reassure the EU that the US has not sacrificed transatlantic relationships
in its enthusiasm for closer trade links with Asia and Latin America, and to
seek practical ways of working together on shared commercial objectives.
The administration's thinking was outlined by Mr Ron Brown, US commerce
secretary, at meetings in Brussels last week with Mr Jacques Santer,
president-elect of the European Commission, and Sir Leon Brittan and Mr
Martin Bangemann, respectively the commissioners for trade and industry.
The US has not decided what form the new partnership should take. But Mr
Jeffrey Garten, under-secretary of commerce for international trade, who
accompanied Mr Brown, said it would demean the proposal to describe it
simply as a free trade area.
He said the administration's aim over the next year was to elevate the
European dimension of its international policies in several ways.
A top US priority was to win EU support for stricter international
disciplines on export subsidies, particularly the use of official aid to win
big infrastructure contracts in the developing world.
Though the administration has sharply stepped up support for exports, Mr
Garten said its ultimate goal was to reduce the role of governments in
international markets. He was worried by Japan's untied aid, which he said
totalled Dollars 15bn to Dollars 20bn (Pounds 9bn-Pounds 12bn) annually,
almost half of it for infrastructure projects in China.
The US suspects the aid is used to favour Japanese companies and wants more
information about how it is spent. Washington also wants international
action to curb the use of bribes to win export orders.
Mr Garten said another important goal of the proposed dialogue with the EU
was closer co-ordination of trade policy in the new World Trade Organisation
and other multilateral forums.
However, Mr Garten said this did not rule out further US bilateral trade
initiatives, particularly towards Japan and China, where very vigorous
action was likely.
The US also wants to seek ways of reducing obstacles to trade with the EU,
particularly in the information industries. Mr Brown has proposed that the
two sides should hold preparatory talks before a G7 meeting on
telecommunications policy in Brussels early next year.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Italian coalition totters as Bossi pulls out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, looks
almost certain to be brought down in a no confidence vote on Wednesday after
the weekend defection of Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern
League.
The fall of the eight-month-old right-wing coalition would initiate a highly
unstable period of political bargaining. All the options for forming a new
government are beset by serious unresolved problems and, in the absence of a
new parliamentary majority, early elections could be called for next spring.
After weeks of mounting dissension between Mr Berlusconi and Mr Bossi, the
League leader announced his formal break with the government coalition on
Saturday. Mr Bossi said he was backing a no confidence motion to be proposed
jointly with Mr Rocco Buttiglione's Popular party (PPI), the heirs of the
Christian Democrats who dominated Italy's post-war politics until
discredited by the country's spate of corruption scandals.
Mr Bossi played down suggestions that his break with the government would
split the League and leave him as head of a small rump of the movement. In
recent days as many as 50 of the 163 League members in both houses have
talked of staying with Mr Berlusconi.
But Mr Bossi has proved an astute politician and it is significant that the
League has not directly associated itself with two other motions of no
confidence also being presented on Wednesday. One of these has been tabled
by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), the main
opposition force, with which Mr Bossi has been in close contact.
An open alliance with the PDS is still rejected by many in the League
because of the former's communist past and its ambiguous relationship with
Reconstructed Communism, which represents the hardline core of the old
Italian Communist party (PCI).
Reconstructed Communism has tabled a third motion of no confidence. These
separate motions will have the benefit of allowing at least one trial run to
test the compactness of the League vote and the scale of opposition to Mr
Berlusconi. At the same time the three votes allow the League, as well as
the PPI, to signal their distance from the left.
Even if the League splits, it would be surprising if the anti-government
bloc failed to muster the 316 votes necessary to bring down Mr Berlusconi -
albeit by a slim margin.
The present coalition consists of Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement, the
League, Mr Gianfranco Fini's neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, and two
minor partners, the Christian Democratic Centre (CCD) and Radicals.
Altogether the coalition has 368 votes in the chamber of deputies, of which
the League accounts for 105.
The PDS-led Progressives have 167, while the PPI has 33. The 39 deputies of
Reconstructed Communism have said they will vote to bring down the
government.
The timing of Wednesday's no confidence votes still depends on completion of
the 1995 budget's progress through parliament. On Saturday night the Senate
gave its final stamp of approval.
Delaying tactics could be used on the final budget sessions this week in the
chamber of deputies by government supporters, thus postponing the confidence
debate.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Turkey's rights record jeopardises customs union: A crucial
meeting in Brussels today is under threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM and KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greek intransigence and anger at Turkish human rights abuses are threatening
a crucial meeting in Brussels today between the European Union and Turkey.
EU foreign ministers, senior European Commission officials and a Turkish
delegation are scheduled to take a final decision on establishing a customs
union, due to come into force on January 1 1996.
But the sentencing earlier this month of eight Kurdish MPs to long jail
terms for violating Turkey's strict security laws has crystallised
opposition to the union in the European parliament and some national
governments. Foremost among the opponents is Greece, which, after failing to
persuade Germany, the EU's current president, to postpone today's meeting,
appears determined to veto the deal.
Officials hope the meeting will still go ahead, with a decision postponed
for a few months to allow tempers to cool and negotiators time to reach a
compromise. However, were the meeting to be cancelled at the last minute,
there could be an angry confrontation between Turkey and Europe which would
damage an already troubled relationship.
Ankara state security court's verdict on the MPs on the eve of the European
Union's Essen summit could scarcely have come at a worse time. It
embarrassed the German presidency, which had lobbied for customs union.
European Commission President Jacques Delors said in a French television
interview that jailing the Kurdish MPs was 'scandalous'. He added he was
against customs union without 'guarantees' that Turkey would respect human
rights.
Last Thursday the European Parliament adopted a non-binding resolution
calling for today's meeting to be suspended and demanding the jailed MPs'
release. Support in some EU governments for Turkey all but evaporated after
the trial.
To make matters worse for Turkey, a Kurdish human rights lawyer was murdered
last week, and Ankara's security court begins proceedings today against two
human rights campaigners accused of violating anti-terrorism laws by writing
a booklet on torture. The booklet was partly financed by the EU.
Greek opposition to customs union is linked more closely to the Socialist
government's efforts to secure EU entry for Cyprus by the end of the 1990s
than to its traditional hostility to Turkey.
Mr Andreas Papandreou, Greek prime minister, failed at last week's EU summit
to win agreement on a definite date for starting talks on Cypriot accession.
Together with customs union, Greece will continue to block the release of
Ecu600m (Pounds 472.2m) in EU aid to Turkey, held up for eight years by lack
of progress on reuniting Cyprus.
While the European Commission is committed to including Cyprus in the next
EU enlargement, membership negotiations are likely to be complicated by the
island's division into separate states.
However, France, which assumes the EU's rotating six-month presidency next
month, is determined to see customs union adopted and will press Greece to
abandon its objections and Turkey to make concessions on human rights.
Customs union would give European companies free access to a market of 60m
people and an economy that until this year was the fastest growing in the
OECD. Half Turkey's trade is already with the EU and two thirds of its
foreign investment comes from Europe.
Turkey would in effect join the single European market, with some of the
rights and obligations of an EU member. Yet in contrast to the position of
the post-communist countries of eastern Europe or even Malta or Cyprus,
Brussels has told Turkey that membership is not on the agenda. It has twice
rejected Turkish applications for full membership.
For Turks, who see themselves as Europeans, rejection is deeply wounding.
They believe concern for human rights is a smokescreen for Europe's
anti-Moslem prejudices. President Suleyman Demirel says: 'Turkey is a
European country. Europe is not only a geographic area, but a system of
values. I think Turkey should be part of Europe, it should not be ousted.'
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller says customs union will 'anchor Turkey to the
west in a definitive and irreversible way'. Rejection, she and many European
officials argue, would halt Turkey's progress to full democracy. It would
benefit extremists, marginalise democrats and stunt the economic growth that
could foster stability.
However, Mrs Ciller bears great responsibility for Turkey's present
predicament. It was she who urged parliament to lift the eight Kurdish MPs'
parliamentary immunity, allowing them to be prosecuted. Parliament has still
not approved a political reform package her coalition government promised
three years ago.
Yet diplomats believe a bill introduced into parliament on Friday creating a
human rights ministry indicates that pressure from Brussels is having a
positive effect.
But there is no sign of an end to violence in the mainly Kurdish south-east,
where fighting between security forces and the Kurdistan Workers' party
(PKK) has claimed more than 13,000 lives in the past 10 years. The battle
against PKK guerrillas both entrenches the military's political power and is
used to justify security laws that punish 'crimes of thought'.
As Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister who has supported customs
union, put it last week: 'If Turkey wants to join Europe, it must not turn a
cold shoulder to everything Europe stands for.'

FT  19 DEC 94 / We are the liberators, say Chechens: The root of the
conflict lies in the break-up of the Soviet Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Usman Imayev, the Chechen minister of justice, sits in his office in
battle dress with grenades clipped to his belt, cartridge magazines curving
out of his pockets and a Kalashnikov automatic on his fax machine.
'In March 1991,' he says, 'there was a referendum on the continued existence
of the Soviet Union, in which millions of people voted, including in
Chechnya, and it got a majority.
'Then in December 1991 three men, the leaders of Russia, Ukraine and
Belarus, decided to break up the Soviet Union. Chechnya had no hand in that.
We did not sign the federation agreement with other republics of Russia. We
did not take part in the referendum on the Russian constitution. So when
Yeltsin talks about unconstitutional acts - who began them?'
Mr Imayev's words have a certain logic. Most obviously, President Boris
Yeltsin recreated Russia from the ruins of a state which was internationally
recognised and functioning.
By acting to break up the Union, he lays himself open to the charge to which
all revolutionaries who attempt to stabilise a new order are subject: what
gives them the right to say where the revolution stops? If such action was
taken to liberate Russia, why cannot Chechens act in the same way to
liberate Chechnya from Russia?
Second, Mr Yeltsin broke up a state which was multinational. Even if Russian
primacy was indisputable, the forms and many of the practices inscribed the
equality of the races.
Now Russia has to remake herself according to Russian traditions - which are
not even formally those of a Moslem mountain people like the Chechens, whose
greatest pride is their long struggle against Tsarist colonisation.
In this knot of issues lies the root of the conflict, and of its importance
to the Russian state and the future of its democracy and its reforms. Soviet
communism gave Russia a cloak for prolonging imperialism and, at the same
time, placed constraints on how it acted.
For those who liked Russia least - and the Chechens of all the peoples
within Russia must take the prize for that - the new order is felt more as a
burden than a liberation.
Thus when, three years ago, General Dzhokar Dudayev, a Soviet air force
general, roused his nation to independence from Russia, he was playing on
strings of national consciousness which vibrated ever more strongly to his
touch.
'In the first year of independence,' said Mr Suleiman Khadjimuratov, a
prefect of Vedenskopvo region near the capital, Grozny, 'many people were
not sure what it meant. Now, no one will give it up.'
The issue, it seems, transcends the manifest personal and public failings of
a leader who has helped reduce the Chechen standard of living far below that
of much of the rest of Russia and reneged on all of his promises of a better
life and greater security.
Gen Dudayev is not greatly admired by most Chechens for his achievements -
save only that he established independence. That appears to be genuinely,
widely, popular. The attempts by Russian leaders such as Mr Nikolai Yegorov,
the Russian deputy premier who is the presidential representative for
Chechnya, to paint the country as a nation of 'slaves' terrified into
acquiescence by Gen Dudayev's thugs, are wide of the mark.
Chechnya thus poses a fundamental challenge to Russian statehood. This
anyway is fragile and incomplete, cramped within borders which, though still
vast, are unfamiliarly truncated in the minds of most Russians accustomed to
regard the Soviet Union as their free space.
In the minds of the Chechens, Chechnya is the historic land of their
fathers.
For Mr Yeltsin, who has for three years delayed attempting to unravel, or
cut, the Chechen knot, it is the sharpest issue since the parliamentary
revolt against him in the summer and autumn of last year.
To cede Chechnya on the grounds that its people do not wish to be part of
the newly recreated Russia is to call into question all of the lands and
peoples conquered in the 19th century, and even before.
There is, besides, some truth in the propaganda put out by the Russian
authorities on Chechnya.
It has been for most of the past three years a state in which criminal bands
operated relatively freely and where the proceeds from vast amounts of oil
were diverted. And it has been a region from which the Russians, and many
others (including many Chechens) have fled in fear of the future or in
disgust at a present in which their nationality is treated as a barrier to
employment and advancement.
Two voices are battling for Mr Yeltsin's ear.
One is that of his security and military advisers and ministers, for whom
Chechnya is the place where the rot stops and the crack of firm government
is heard. It says that a chance must be grasped firmly to demonstrate to
Russians, their neighbours and the world that the integrity of the Russian
state cannot be challenged without a great cost being paid.
The other voice is that of the democrats and liberals, the majority of whom
are horrified by the war, not so much because of what it will do to Chechnya
as because of what it will do to democratic institutions.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of Russia's Choice and the most vocal on the issue,
pleaded again with the president, with whom he is reluctant to make the
final break, to pull back from an attack which would 'destroy all you have
achieved' in the way of reforms.
For Mr Gaidar and other reformers the coalition of forces mobilised to take
Grozny at any price, emboldened by their success in making the president
head of the war party, could sweep on to strike against the market and
representative institutions.
Perhaps because of this cacophony of voices, Mr Yeltsin as of last night had
not yet sanctioned the final push against Chechnya. Perhaps he cannot. After
all, a sizeable part of the invasion force, that commanded by Gen Ivan
Babichev, has stopped over 30 miles from Grozny and refused to move further.
However this affair ends, the Babichev challenge, with support from fellow
generals Alexander Lebed of the Fourteenth Army and Boris Gromov, the first
deputy defence minister, will have consequences which must be dealt with.
The Chechnya affair has not ended: it may only have just begun.
At stake are democracy, reform and the survival of the present
administration. As 1994 runs out and the fourth year of the new Russia
begins, these are all at hazard.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Partisans prepare for guerrilla campaign: Mountain conflict
'could spark unrest throughout north Caucasus'

If Russia's troops try to take Grozny by force they risk being drawn into a
protracted guerrilla war in Chechnya's mountainous terrain which could spark
unrest throughout the Islamic peoples of the north Caucasus, Chechen
resistance fighters say.
In a village outside Grozny, Mr Ayub Khansulatov, a 30-year-old Chechen who
is carefully placing pins into a set of hand grenades, says: 'We have to get
ready.' Pointing to a stash of armour-piercing rockets, machine guns and
Kalashnikov rifles lying a few feet away, he adds: 'These are for Yeltsin.'
As Moscow's ultimatums to the Chechen people expire, hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of partisans like Mr Khansulatov are preparing to wage a
guerrilla war. Along the roads out of Grozny are groups of fighters dressed
in full battle gear huddling round fires of burning tyres to keep warm in
the sub-zero temperatures.
'I have been ready to fight for a week but now we have been ordered to take
to the mountains and fight a guerrilla war,' Mr Khansulatov says, boasting
of his skirmishes with Russian troops.
Many of Grozny's 400,000 inhabitants have already left for the mountains to
the south. On Chechen television, bearded soldiers urge the rest of the
population to leave the town to the troops.
They say the crowds of civilians, which have been mobbing Russian forces to
persuade them to turn back, should move out of the way of fighting. One
soldier reads from an instruction manual indicating the most vulnerable
points of a tank.
Mr Khansulatov says his detachment of 150 men would fight for as long as it
took to make the Russians leave. He says he has already moved his wife and
three children to seek shelter in the south.
'I have taken my belongings to the mountains. If I die, my son will get
them,' he says, standing in his house bare of all furniture except two beds,
a load of weapons, and a television and video recorder on which he plays a
tape of his brother's wedding celebrations. 'Why cannot they let us live in
peace. You see how good life can be?'

FT  19 DEC 94 / Pressure for EU referendum set to grow: Move seen as way of
appeasing Eurosceptic MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure on pro-European cabinet ministers to back a referendum on Britain's
future in Europe is set to intensify early next year amid signs that
rebellious Tory backbenchers will step up their feud with Mr John Major's
government.
As the cabinet prepares to work out its negotiating position for the next
stage of European Union integration, the government is being pressed to
promise a referendum on the issue in an effort to appease Tory Euro-rebels
in the Commons.
Mr Major and other ministers are expected to debate a referendum early in
the new year, when they discuss their negotiating position for the EU's
inter-governmental conference in 1996.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary, are among pro-European ministers who have already made
clear they are against consulting the British public over any deal signed at
the conference.
However, the pressure on both men to back a referendum looked set to grow
yesterday amid signs of a worsening feud between the government and the nine
Tory MPs who lost the party whip after voting against the European Finance
Bill this month.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, issued one of the sharpest attacks
yet on the group, arguing that their dissent threatened to consign the party
to the political wilderness.
'We have to remember that the Conservative party is not a debating society,
it is not indulging in internal discussion for some sort of literary
purpose,' he told BBC1's On the Record programme. 'Politics is about power.'
But one of the rebels, Mr Nicholas Budgen, MP for Wolverhampton South West,
demanded that the government rule out at once the possibility of joining a
single currency.
'The whip should be publicly offered back to us all at the same time,' he
wrote in the Mail on Sunday. 'This should be an occasion for generosity and
not for nitpicking and malice, comparing the character of the various
members of the group.'
At meetings of the cabinet's sub-committee on European questions next month,
ministers are expected to set out the broad direction they want the EU to
take into the next century.
In an effort to end deep divisions within the Conservative party over the
next stage of European integration, the cabinet may also agree the
conditions under which it would offer a referendum to the British people.
Friends of Mr Clarke said yesterday the chancellor might back a referendum
in the event that the IGC set Europe on a strongly pro-federalist path. 'I
think there will be a government announcement and one that will not leave
people isolated,' a close ally of the chancellor said. 'There has been a
move towards common ground in the cabinet in the last week or two. We can't
stick with the current uncertainty over a referendum because it's too
divisive.'

FT  19 DEC 94 / Moscow rejects peace talks offer from Chechnya: Russian
aircraft bomb Chechen capital amid reports of troop advances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Russian government last night rejected an offer of peace talks by
Chechnya's president, Gen Dzhokar Dudayev, amid reports that Russian troops
were advancing on Grozny, the capital of the breakaway republic.
Itar-Tass, the Russian government agency, reported fighting but it was not
clear if a full-scale attack was taking place. Early today Russian aircraft
carried out sorties over the city, twice dropping bombs.
On the political front, stalemate between the Russian and Chechen
leaderships continued when Moscow brushed aside Gen Dudayev's offer, in a
telegram, of talks in Grozny.
Earlier President Boris Yeltsin had demanded that Gen Dudayev meet senior
Russian officials at the Russian military base of Mozdok, near the Chechen
border. Russia had called for Gen Dudayev to negotiate an agreement on
handing over weapons, and set a deadline of midnight on Saturday.
'There will be no more responses to Dzhokhar Dudayev's telegrams,' said
President Yeltsin's press office last night, adding that Russia's resolve to
restore order in Chechnya would be 'implemented in full'.
During daylight hours yesterday there were relatively light engagements
between the Russian division to the north of Grozny and the Chechen forces -
even though the Russian deadline had expired. Just across the Chechen border
with Ingushetia nine Chechens were reported shot dead after Russian soldiers
opened fire on a convoy of cars.
The stand-off threatened not just the stability of other northern Caucasian
republics but that of the Russian administration. Mr Yeltsin faces the
agonising choice between committing troops to a bloodbath or seeking a
compromise which may be seen by the army and Russian nationalist forces as a
betrayal.
The skirmishes between the Russian and Chechen forces have seen a Russian
general in the field, supported by some of his superiors, refuse to fight.
The past week has also seen the splintering of Russia's liberal-democratic
forces over the issue, and hostility or at best scepticism from the
parliament towards the administration's actions.
Threats on the part of senior officials have not been followed through in
spite of the flouting of three separate Russian deadlines.
In a publicity coup, Gen Dudayev has asked Turkey to mediate in the
conflict, according to the Turkish foreign ministry. The ministry said he
had sent a telegram to President Suleyman Demirel, saying he was willing to
stop fighting and 'find a peaceful solution' with Turkish help.
The ministry statement said Turkey had been first to voice its concerns over
developments in Chechnya and that 'it has become obvious that Turkey's
concerns were warranted'.
Mrs Tansu Ciller, the Turkish premier, said in a separate message to Mr
Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, that the Turkish people
were worried about the fighting.
The Chechens, like the Turks, are largely Moslem and had in the past been
part of the Turkish empire.
The conflict has already provoked warnings from the Confederation of
Caucasian Peoples, which aims to unite the region's republics, that if there
is a war, 'it would not be a Russian-Chechen war, it would be a
Russian-Caucasian war'.
Mr Yeltsin sent troops to the mountainous region of about 1m people after it
had defied Kremlin rule for three years. Russian government officials say
14,000 Chechens have fled Grozny since the troops went in. Many headed for
Dagestan or Ingushetia, two other autonomous regions on Russia's southern
rim.
We are the liberators, say Chechens, Page 2

FT  19 DEC 94 / Tory party hit by sharp drop in business donations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party faces sharply mounting difficulties raising funds
from its traditional supporters in British business.
A Financial Times investigation shows a steep fall in donations from
Britain's biggest companies and a poor performance by the secretive
fund-raising network set up among business leaders.
A survey of Britain's largest 100 companies shows that donations to the
Tories fell 34.3 per cent in real terms last year compared with 1988, an
equivalent year in the election cycle.
The FT has also found that the fund-raising network of business executives
is likely to fall well short of its financial targets this year.
The party already has a Pounds 15m overdraft and is expected to face a
struggle to break even in the financial year ending in March.
Up to half the donations made by companies and individuals to the party are
channelled through a network of 10 regional councils, each one comprising up
to 12 Tory-supporting business leaders.
In the past the network has provided up to Pounds 4m a year but reports from
the councils suggest some may raise no more than half their targets.
Lord Laing, former chairman of food company United Biscuits and former joint
treasurer of the Conservatives, said the councils accounted for 30 per cent
to 50 per cent of total donations.
Of the 10 councils, the most important is the London-based City and
Industrial Liaison Council, which has accounted for donations of up to
Pounds 1.5m a year.
Midlands Industrial Council, based in Birmingham and covering the west
Midlands, is believed to have a target this year of about Pounds 800,000. It
is thought unlikely to raise more than half this amount.
As one council chairman commented: 'This year is bloody hellish. Everybody
hates me (when I ask for money).'

FT  19 DEC 94 / Saatchi set deadline on offer to stay as head of subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Maurice Saatchi has been given until January 3 to decide whether to stay
at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising group he founded 24 years ago. If he
remains it will be in the largely honorific position of president of the
holding company and chairman of the subsidiary, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Advertising Worldwide.
After the boardroom coup, which on Friday night saw him ousted from the
chairmanship of the company and removed from the board following a row over
options, his friends said they were sure he would sever all connections with
the group.
Mr Saatchi was this weekend discussing with his brother Charles whether they
should set up a new agency. The chances of the brothers starting again are
remote, according to a close colleague, who said: 'After all the money they
have made and at their age (on the cusp of 50), I don't think they really
have the appetite for it.'
Meanwhile, a senior Conservative party adviser suggested Mr Saatchi might be
a candidate for the vacant post of head of the prime minister's Policy Unit.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi holds the Conservative party's advertising account and
devised the 'Labour Isn't Working' campaign.
Mr Charles Scott, Saatchi's chief executive, will this week start the
process of finding a new name for the company, after the board's decision to
drop 'Saatchi' from the holding company's identity.
Mr Scott will also try to stop important clients deserting. The group is
particularly worried about three accounts: Mars, the confectionery group,
British Airways, and Mirror Group Newspapers, all of which were close to Mr
Saatchi.
Such is Mr Saatchi's closeness to the Mars brothers, John and Forrest, that
on Friday evening, when the board told him he was being removed, he
contacted them in a last-ditch attempt to put pressure on Saatchi directors.
Mars, British Airways and Mirror Group Newspapers together contribute about
8 per cent of the company's Pounds 800m annual revenue. The company
therefore regards their potential loss as serious but not devastating.
Mirror Group is thought likely to keep its account with Saatchi unless it
becomes unhappy with the agency's work. Mr David Montgomery, MGN chief
executive, wrote to Saatchi's board last week to express his gratitude for
Mr Saatchi's work. However, Mirror Group sources suggested Mr Saatchi's
departure would have little impact on its day-to-day relationship with the
agency.
British Airways said yesterday it had made no decision on the future of its
relationship with Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.
A senior advertising industry executive said he did not believe all three
would desert. 'It is very difficult for them to leave, because it would
require them to change their advertising campaigns, which they will be
reluctant to do,' he said.

Flemish chef Roger Souvereyns has been crowned king of Belgian cuisine on
his 56th birthday. Souvereyns, owner of Scholteshof restaurant in Hasselt,
was awarded 19.5 out of 20 in Gault-Millau's guide to restaurants in
continental Europe, 1995. That rating, the highest Gault-Millau ever gives,
earns him the title of Chef of the Year. He has two Michelin stars.
From your table in the restaurant, you can watch Souvereyns in the kitchen,
composing carefully concentrated flavours. He works closely with Nicolas
Santi, his young French sommelier, who this year won the title of Best
Sommelier in Belgium for French wines. Says Souvereyns: 'For me, the wine is
as important as the food. If the wine does not balance the food in its
flavours and spices, it can kill the dish, and the reverse is also true.'
Scholteshof, literally the bailiff's house, is an 18th century manor in
Limbourg, Flanders, near the Dutch and German borders. Souvereyns has
attracted a loyal following of cross-border diners.
The restaurant is set in grounds planted with a maze, a vineyard, orchards,
a traditional herb and vegetable garden, and a lawn with an ornamental
border, pond and gazebo and is about 45 minutes from Brussels.
Scholteshof is refreshingly relaxed. If you want to drink - rather than
merely taste - the wine, think about staying the night at the comfortable
hotel that is part of the complex. It is worth noting that Belgium has just
tightened its drink-driving laws.
Three-course seasonal lunch BFr1,700 (Pounds 33) or BFr2,550 including wine.
Scholteshof Kermstraat 130, 3512 Hasselt-Stevoort, Belgium. Tel: 32 2 11 25

Aubrey Newman &amp; Daughters of 79 High Street, Burford in Oxfordshire

Once again, Oddbins has released a range of malt whiskies for the Christmas
season, all keenly-priced and sold at cask strength.
They are: the Bruichiaddich 1980, at Pounds 29.99; the Highland Park 1976
(59 per cent), at Pounds 32.49; Glengarioch 1971, at Pounds 39.99;
17-year-old Port Ellen (59.6), at Pounds 29.99; 22-year-old Brora, at Pounds
39.99; 23-year-old St Magdalen (58.1), at Pounds 39.99; and Dallas Dhu
24-year-old (60.6), also at Pounds 39.99. It should be remembered that these
high strengths mean that you are getting a bottle and a half of a whisky at
40 per cent alcohol, but you will need to add more water.
The Highland Park is a gorgeous dram with all the peatiness you would expect
from this Orkney stalwart; the Glengarioch has classic Speyside sweetness;
the Port Ellen has a surprising fruitiness, rather like raspberries (you try
it]); the St Magdalen is as elegant and understated as a good Lowland should
be; the Dallas Dhu a classic in honey and heather.
I have had better bottlings of Bruichiaddich; and the Brora has an odd
redolence of summer road works which might frighten off the less committed
whisky buff.

<TEXT>
A long and costly effort by the the Australian federal government to
extradite Mr Christopher Skase, one of Australia's high-flying entrepreneurs
in the 1980s and head of the now-collapsed Qintex group, appeared to have
collapsed yesterday when a Spanish court upheld his appeal and freed him.
The full bench of the Audiencia Nacional, Spain's highest court, made its
decision known only indirectly and it was several hours before Australian
officials learned of it. The court's reasons are not likely to be known
before Monday.
Australia had sought his extradition so he could face 32 charges arising
from the collapse of his media and resort empire in 1989. The failure left
corporate debts of around ADollars 1.5bn (Pounds 680m) and additional
personal debts.

Two US hedge funds agreed to pay Dollars 76m to settle charges that they
manipulated the US Treasury bond market in April 1991. Steinhardt Management
and Caxton had been accused by the Justice Department and the Securities and
Exchange Commission of a market 'squeeze', in which they conspired to corner
the market in two-year Treasury notes to drive up prices.
According to the authorities, they took positions worth Dollars 20bn in a
Dollars 12bn issue of notes, enabling them to make illegal profits of
Dollars 35m. The settlement, in which neither fund admitted or denied the
allegations, is unrelated to the bigger Treasury market 'squeeze' for which
Salomon Brothers admitted responsibility two years ago.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The four South American countries in the Mercosur trade group yesterday
settled all their differences and said they were ready for the trade area to
become a full customs union from January 1 as planned.
Foreign ministers from Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay reached
agreement on a number of outstanding problems after a hectic night of
negotiation.
The agreements will be included in the document, to be known as the protocol
of Ouro Preto, which is to be signed by the four presidents today and will
give Mercosur a similar legal status to the European Union.
Mr Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign minister, said he was 'very proud' the
four countries had put in place the first customs union among developing
countries.
The protocol also sets out rules for the Mercosur institutions such as an
arbitration system for disputes and rules to promote competition and ease
customs procedures.
The four countries agreed the final lists of products, mainly those
considered unready to face full competition, which will be allowed to keep
domestic tariffs for four more years rather than cut tariffs to zero
immediately.
Brazil and Argentina, which together account for more than 95 per cent of
Mercosur's gross domestic product, also reached an accord on their
automotive industries. Because both countries consider this sector
strategic, it is given a special exemption from the free trade rules.
The protocol commits the four countries to review before 2001 when and
whether to go ahead toward a full common market, which implies the free
movement of goods and labour.

<TEXT>
The Philippines has formalised an agreement with the International Monetary
Fund for an increase in 1995 monetary expansion targets that will allow the
country to aim for an overall economic growth of about 6 to 6.5 per cent,
negotiators from both panels announced yesterday. Mr Gabriel Singson,
governor of the central bank, said total domestic liquidity, or M3, would be
allowed to grow by 23 per cent, while base money (currency in circulation
and reserve balances of banks) could increase by up to 24 per cent. The
previous targets were 13.3 per cent for M3 and 9.5 per cent for base money.
The IMF agreed to the rise to give the Philippines 'more elbow room for
growth manoeuvres' following an 'overperformance' in the international
reserves, Mr Singson said.
Philippine gross national product is projected to grow by 5.5 per cent this
year, compared to 3.5 to 4.5 per cent projected in the IMF programme, while
inflation is forecast to average 9.2 per cent, against the target of 9.5 per
cent.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Saatchi forced to stand down as chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Maurice Saatchi was last night forced to stand down as chairman of
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising group he founded in 1970, after the board
succumbed to pressure from a group of US shareholders.
However, at 7.30pm he was still considering an offer to stay on as chairman
of one of the group's advertising subsidiaries, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Advertising Worldwide.
The board yesterday formally recommended that the holding company drop
'Saatchi' from its masthead. It will be retained only by the advertising
subsidiary.
The board was reluctant to take the decision but was told by its financial
and legal advisers - there were 12 lawyers in the boardroom - that they had
no choice in the face of shareholder pressure.
US shareholders controlling 30 per cent of the shares, led by Harris
Associates of Chicago, have been campaigning for Mr Saatchi's removal,
because of their anger at a proposal that he receive a Pounds 5m option
package.
They were also furious at Mr Saatchi's opposition to dropping the 'Saatchi'
name from the holding company masthead.
A decision was also taken at the board meeting, at the group's headquarters
in London's Charlotte Street, for a new option scheme to be put in place to
reward company directors and senior executives.
Unlike the 'super option' scheme, which was criticised by the shareholders,
the new plan will meet the guidelines of the Association of British
Insurers, the investment institution lobby group.
The board was told by its advisers that it had no option after soundings
were taken on Thursday of UK investment institutions, led by unit trust
group, M&amp;G, which owns 5 per cent. The informal poll, made by M&amp;G, showed
that shareholders controlling a further 28 per cent would either support a
motion to oust Mr Saatchi or ab-stain.
Because shareholders owning more than half the group were showing no support
for Mr Saatchi, the company's merchant bank, SG Warburg, was forced to tell
the board that it could see little alternative to Mr Saatchi's departure.
Mr Saatchi had during the day been making a last-ditch attempt to persuade
the board of the possible damage to the company from his departure. On
Thursday he contacted his friends, John and Forrest Mars, owners of
confectionery and foods group, Mars, who said they would review whether to
keep their advertising business at the company if he went. Mars is one of
the group's biggest clients
He also presented the board with letters backing him from several senior
executives.
Four of the group's six non-executives were present.

I'M HERE I THINK, WHERE ARE YOU? by Timothy West Nick Hern Pounds 14.99, 224
pages
Touring days, alluring days, someone trills in one of Coward's more
sentimental numbers; no longer. Few actors in modern times have felt its
allure quite as strongly as Timothy West and his wife Prunella Scales.
I'm Here I Think, Where are You? is a collection of the letters which West
has sent to Scales over 30 years of touring, national and global; their
publication makes more widely available the shrewdness, drollery, and
brilliant raconteurial gifts of a delightful companion.
His theme is inevitably geographical and theatrical, but the book's appeal
is not to be confined to theatre - or indeed movie-goers.
Typically direct and undeluded, he conveys an affection for and a
fascination with the craft of which he is such a master; sometimes one could
wish to know more (I could wish to know more) about how he went about
creating his satyr-like Shpigelsky in A Month in The Country (a performance
in a supporting role which brought an entire universe of character onto the
stage) or his heart-broken and heart-breaking Enobarbus.
In the end, though, he is not interested in analysing his work: well he was
writing home to his wife, after all, and trying to tell her about where he
was and what was happening (there is a letter of great power about a visit
to Russia) and to raise a laugh, which he succeeds in doing again and again.
Reading the book is as easy, as diverting (and as frequently instructive) as
sitting down to supper with the man; pour yourself a nice malt whisky and
settle down with it. You had better bring the bottle over, come to think of
it, because once you have started you will find it hard to stop.

FT  17 DEC 94 / The monks' empty glass cabinet: The missing Codex Sinaiticus
sits in London. But should it be returned to its original home?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is a tale of two libraries. They are thousands of miles apart, but
united in their respect for scholarship and reverence for the written word.
They both, in their own way, contain awesome collections of manuscripts and
richly repay the effort of a visit. I have seen both in the past week and,
in the course of my travels, heard for the first time the sad story of the
Codex Sinaiticus.
The first visit was to the library of the Greek Orthodox monks of St
Catharine's monastery at the foot of Mount Sinai. The location is, as
promised in the ever-thickening piles of tourist brochures, spectacular, the
6th century church radiant with early Byzantine splendour.
The library, said our guide from the monastery, was laden with riches from
the early years of Christianity; but the jewel of their collection was
missing. He pointed to a glass case in the corner containing a few sheets of
parchment with Greek writing on them. A poorly-taken photograph was stuck on
the cabinet with Sellotape. It showed what should have been inside: the
Codex Sinaiticus, a 4th century bible regarded as one of the three most
important early versions of the holy book in existence.
Our guide, more in sorrow than in anger, told us the monks' side of the
story. The Codex was borrowed by a 19th century German scholar, Constantine
Tischendorf, who promised he would bring it back to its proper home. The
letter in which he made his pledge hangs on one of the church walls.
Instead, the Codex ended up in the hands of the Russian Tsar in St
Petersburg. There it remained until the Soviet government, which
unsurprisingly had little use for the tome, sold it to the British Museum in
1933, reputedly to help pay for the restoration of its embassy in London.
The monks' glass cabinet, in the meantime, has remained empty.
And so, a few days later, I visited my second library; not, strictly
speaking, a library at all, but room 30 of the British Museum in London,
which contains a staggeringly valuable collection of original documents and
volumes: Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, the Slavonic Gospels, Haydn's Drum-Roll
symphony; even a letter from John Lennon, bless him, to his old mucker
Stuart Sutcliffe.
And there, in an unobtrusive corner, the Codex Sinaiticus, next to the Codex
Alexandrinus, not too far from Nelson's Memorandum and a germ's leap away
from the culture plate on which Fleming discovered penicillin  - odd
bed-fellows to be sure, but part of the eclectic charm of the place, I
suppose.
I ranted to myself (and to a startled shop assistant) about the evils of
cultural imperialism and suddenly hated this cultured corner of Bloomsbury
which has caused so much distress round the world. But I instinctively felt
on dodgy ground. And so it proved.
The British Museum side of the story, as expressed in one of its books, soon
clears away the smokescreen of sentiment. Tischendorf, according to their
sources, actually rescued the pages of the Codex from being incinerated by
the monks for winter fuel. He then persuaded them to present the book to the
Tsar in appreciation of the protection of Holy Russia, in order to safeguard
it.
The guide in the monastery had heard the argument, and duly rubbished it
('How, then, did we manage to keep it in perfect condition for 15
centuries?'). But I spoke to a couple of authorities in the field who
confirmed my worst fears. The monks of St Catharine's at that time, it
seems, cared as much for their treasures as for a sack of coal. Their
attitude to antiquity, one of them told me, showed 'an irresponsibility that
beggars description'.
But that is not the end of the story; for today's monks are very aware
indeed of the value of their collection, and assure us that they know
exactly how to look after it. The rules of the game are different. Tourists
are beginning to flock to Sinai as they have traditionally flocked to
Bloomsbury, they listen to the monks' plight, they curse Europe's cynical
plunderers. The British Museum is finding it more and more difficult to play
the straight bat of rightful ownership; and rightly so. For possession is
only nine-tenths, after all, and when did the law ever capture hearts and
change minds anyway?

FT  17 DEC 94 / As They Say in Europe: Grand contradiction hits 50
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This weekend marks the fiftieth anniversary of Le Monde. At least the paper
first appeared on the December 18, 1944, even though it was dated the 19th,
a practice which continues to this day. It is hard on those who want to know
last night's football results, but Le Monde wishes to discourage that kind
of reader anyway.
It began life - on the presses of a daily which had been soiled by
collaboration - almost simultaneously with another, tattier, Paris daily,
France-Soir. But whereas France-Soir celebrated its 50th birthday last week
with a commemorative edition, Le Monde had to mark its anniversary rather
more grandly.
Three months ago there was an article called 'Heritage', making its readers
aware that a seminal event was to occur before the next solstice: there was
to be a 'colloquium' under the auspices of Unesco. It made the Anglo-Saxon
heart sink.
So, on December 6, the Unesco colloquium took place. It was subtitled
'Reinventing the press'. The invitations were inscribed with a remark taken
from Balzac: 'If the press did not exist it would not be necessary to invent
it.' Up until the moment I read that, I had had a moderately high regard for
Honore de B, but as a coiner of witty phrases he plainly ranks little higher
than the 17th-century aphorist, the duc de La Rochefoucauld, and somewhere
below the noted English idiot, Bertie Wooster.
The press exists because people exist. Newspapers appeared as soon as the
technical means were available. Almost everybody has produced newspapers:
the Nazis had the Volkischer Beobachter, the communists, Pravda. In London
there is The Sun and there is the Financial Times. There is Ouest France
from West France, the Manchester Union-Leader from New Hampshire, and the
Barnes and Mortlake Herald from Barnes and Mortlake.
Some exist to spread lies and hatred, some to appeal to a narrow range of
narrow minds, some to tell of new parking regulations on Church Road and
some to tell their readers what they need to know.
Fortunately, few of the contributions to the colloquium took much notice of
Balzac. Instead the reader learnt of the duties of the press - 'to try to
operate the difficult synthesis between justice and liberty', or its aims -
to make more money, or to give primacy to information over rumour.
This provides a perfect reflection of Le Monde. It is a paper of enormous
pretensions that does a very good job by keeping its readers informed on
diverse topics. It genuflects before every modish fashion while providing a
critical eye on what is going on. It maintains the appearance of heterodoxy
while not really opposing the state.
Sometimes the contradiction, as during the evenements of 1968, for example,
becomes too much. But Le Monde would never question the main policy
foundations of the French state - quitting Nato, the reliance on nuclear
weapons and nuclear power, or the hijacking of trade policy by peasants.
More than a quarter of a century ago, I went to a seminar on Africa in
London where the main speaker was a Le Monde correspondent who lectured the
participants on the politics of the francophone states. It was an undiluted
apology for French policy in the region. When asked why we were being fed
this line, the man from Le Monde said, 'Of course, I would not talk like
this at a Gaullist meeting in Paris.'
The paper annoys its English-speaking readers by mixing news and comment in
a manner that makes the Daily Mail seem objective, and yet it is able to
provide breathtaking insights. I recall many years ago, following a
three-part series on North Korea, of all places, with an enthusiasm normally
reserved for the denouement of a soap opera.
Le Monde is a co-operative of a kind. It harbours many different talents -
those who think themselves the descendants of Montesquieu, those who think
they are international lawyers and some brilliant journalists. There is even
the occasional genius, like the former rugby correspondent, Jean Lacouture,
and the cartoonist, Plantu.
Today, it is not what it was in the 1960s. Then, no youthful intellectual,
from Quebec to Kinshasa, could be seen without the obligatory copy of Le
Monde. It is not the institution it once was, but it is a better paper. And
next month it is to have a new format - does that mean photographs?
But over the 50th anniversary hangs the shadow of the losses to which, at
times, Le Monde seems doomed. The press will not disappear, but individual
newspapers can and do. Le Monde is one that would have to be reinvented.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Private View: Territorial champion - Christian Tyler meets
Jacques Blanc, the new president of the European Committee of the Regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Give him an audience, and Jacques Blanc is airborne. Put him in front of a
home crowd, and he will stay aloft for an hour. I first witnessed the
aerodynamic talents of the mayor of La Canourge (pop. 2,000) at a
winegrowers' banquet in Narbonne in the French Midi.
Surfeited on oysters and bubbly, 500 guests had listened with indifference
to the exertions of a wine-glass percussionist. Politely they had applauded
the caped caballero who pranced among the tables on a white stallion. But
when Blanc took the stage to tell them what they wanted most to hear - that
they could once again become world-beating viticulturists - they responded
with intoxicated roars.
Wine is serious politics in the Languedoc-Roussillon region of which Blanc
is serving his second term as council president. And wine is the theme he
often uses to explain his new role as president of the European Committee of
the Regions, a Maastricht creation set up this year.
One of the pushiest politicians on the French right wing, the 55-year-old
Blanc brings the same aerated rhetoric to the committee's proceedings. Yet
even political adversaries concede that he is a smart operator. Never still,
rarely silent, he has ambition written all over him.
There were cries of 'Stitch-up]' when Blanc won the presidency of the
committee in March. The Socialists had two candidates, Pasqual Maragall of
Barcelona and Charles Gray of Strathclyde; they decided to run Maragall in
order not to split the Left vote.
According to Blanc, Maragall did a deal with the favourite, the Christian
Democrat prime minster of Flanders, Luc van den Brande. 'It was designed to
kill me,' he said. 'But I won.' Meanwhile, opponents claimed, Blanc had done
a deal with Maragall whereby if they led the ballot, they would swap the two
top jobs in 1996.
Over a stylish but workmanlike lunch with members of his entourage in
Brussels I asked Blanc why he had wanted the job so much.
'You underestimate the importance of the committee,' he replied. 'It is
always interesting for a politician to head a brand-new organisation.' The
committee of 189 elected politicians, ranging from regional barons to
municipal captains, is a diluted version of the body first envisaged. The
Germans once talked of it as a second chamber of the European parliament.
Blanc says its consultative function is still enough to give it great
influence over the life of Europe. 'To establish a new political reality in
Europe - there aren't many people who could do that. I consider that next to
the President of the Commission, of the Parliament and of the Council of
Ministers this is the most interesting job.'
But you are still mayor of La Canourge?
'I am the mayor, and I invite you to play golf,' he said with a flash of
teeth.
What do the villagers of La Canourge think you do in Brussels?
'First, they are quite proud. Second, my region and my town are among the
priority development zones and therefore they think Europe has brought them
money. Also that it helps them sell their agricultural products. They think
I am in Brussels too often. But they forgive me.' He leant back with a
satisfied laugh.
What do you do every week?
'I am saving Europe from despair.' He laughed again.
Jacques Blanc started life as a doctor, like his father, and worked as a
general practitioner in La Canourge. His curriculum vitae claims he was also
a neuropsychiatrist specialising in the treatment of handicapped children.
Why did you take up psychiatry?
Blanc gave his usual answer. 'Because it's always interesting to study the
reactions of men - and women.' Here he winked.
I recalled a fellow committee member saying that one thing Jacques Blanc
could not be accused of was paying too close attention to other people's
views. Now Blanc smiled and said: 'I think I was a very good generalist and
a very bad psychiatrist. I'm not mad enough to be a good psychiatrist.'
He went into politics because his Lozere region was turning into a desert.
Now it had registered the first population gain in 100 years. 'I am very
proud of that result, and Europe has contributed.'
From local councillor and mayor, Blanc ascended to the national parliament,
was secretary-general of Valery Giscard d'Estaing's Republican Party and
briefly Minister of Agriculture. When I asked him whether he thought of
himself as a still-rising star, or whether he had reached a plateau, he
said:
'I think a pleasant plateau. I'm not a candidate for the presidency of
France.'
Peaceful for the most part, Blanc's committee was torn apart last month when
it chose to give an opinion on reforming the wine market. Spanish and
Mediterranean members, who fortify their wine with concentrated grape
'must', almost came to blows with the Germans, who use sucrose.
Blanc may have thought he had disarmed north-south tension by announcing,
even before his election, that he would appoint Dietrich Pause, a
gentle-mannered German, as his chief official (the job the Germans wanted).
He would not admit to me that he had made a gaffe, but smoothly declared
that although the debate had been fierce there had been 'elements to satisfy
both sides'.
How can regions agree on anything, I asked, when they are in competition for
EU money?
'It's the essence of Europe to try to overcome what separates the different
entities and try to agree a common line,' Blanc replied. This had been
achieved on such important topics as regional aid (the cohesion fund) and
strengthening the devolution of power (subsidiarity).
The fact that you have large and small authorities on the committee must be
a problem.
'It could have been a blockage and I think most of my success is that I have
prevented it. And why? Because I am at the same time - forgive my lack of
modesty - a big one and a small one, president of a real region and mayor of
a small commune as legitimate as the mayor of Rome or Athens.
'For me there is no big, no small - only the elected representative,
anointed by the voters.'
The mandate of the committee will be renewed at next year's post-Maastricht
negotiation. Blanc hopes to achieve full autonomy from the economic and
social committee with which he has to share administration and paper clips.
He says he does not want control of EU funds.
Don't your electorates think you have money to give them?
'The distribution is conditioned by choices higher up. So if we influence
the big decisions, without ourselves opening the sluice we can have a say in
the water that flows. It is better to be at the source where the great flood
is than at the little pipi end of the tap.' He laughed.
Is there a danger the committee will encourage separatism? 'No.'
Why do people say they are afraid of it? 'Because they haven't understood
what regions are. I believe, on the contrary, that regionalism is the
antidote to separatism.
'I, who am from a centralised nation and defend the nation state, am not at
all bothered by being also spokesman of a region. I'll do it my way. I think
regionalism is the best answer to the complex problems we have in all our
countries, simultaneously reconciling respect for the state, the grand
European design, and the needs of identity.'
Nor, he said, did his committee present any kind of threat to the directly
elected Euro-MPs. 'That is not the way to look at it. It's a question of
complementarity. Euro-MPs have a European mandate. We are elected to exert
territorial influence on policy.'
But will regions one day, in the distant future, under a federal government,
be more important than nation states?
'No. I don't think so. Whether we like it or not, the way chosen is a Europe
of nation states, with, of course, all the different levels that constitute
them.'
Lunch was not over, and Blanc had about 20 minutes in which to catch a
flight to Paris. 'No,' he added, starting up from his chair and taking a
last slurp of coffee, 'the problem of our democracies is that the citizens
don't feel close to those who take the decisions. We have to rediscover that
proximity.'
An aide passed him his coat and briefcase. 'And when I see sometimes how
some of our friends (he seemed to be referring to the Germans) get stuck
over a comma, it shows they have misunderstood the role of the committee.
'When you are a legislator, a word is very important. But when you are being
consulted, it is not the word or the comma that matters, it is the spirit
which blows through it.'
With that, Jacques Blanc stretched out a hand and blew from the room.

FT  17 DEC 94 / All in the Mind: Dream of new skills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Could you learn to ride a bicycle in your sleep? Sleep-learning might seem
an impossible dream but experiments this year show that the way you sleep
and dream are closely related to your effectiveness in learning new things.
A group of Israeli scientists, led by Avi Karni and Dov Sagi of the Weizmann
Institute in Rehovot, measured the time a person took to discriminate the
shape of a patch of stripes embedded in a pattern flashed on a computer
screen.
This task, like bicycle riding, can be learnt. It depends on what theorists
call implicit knowledge, or skill, rather than explicit knowledge, such as
remembering a person's name or a shopping list. It is not easy - rather like
trying to read a striped speedometer needle that appears for a fraction of a
second in a striped dashboard while your gaze is fixed on the fuel gauge.
But three features make the task a breakthrough for research on learning.
It is easy to measure how well people do and how they improve with practice.
This sort of learning is also very specific: if the angle of the stripes, or
their position is changed, the task must be learnt anew. Finally, learning
is very robust: it lasts for years.
Last year, Karni and Sagi showed that speed improved, not during a practice
session, but during the eight hours afterwards while the subjects were doing
other things. This made it possible to study the effects on learning of
sleep and its different stages.
Subjects were trained and tested over a period of days, with sessions just
after rising, and just before retiring. Exactly the same unconscious
learning occurred whether the time between training and testing was spent
asleep or awake. However, if sleeping subjects were roused whenever their
brainwaves showed that they were dreaming, no learning occurred during the
night, although learning resumed the following day. If, instead, subjects
were roused when they entered the deepest stage of sleep, slow-wave sleep,
they learnt normally during the night. This provides the first clear
evidence that brain activity during dreaming sleep promotes learning.
Scientists have long suspected that sleep is related to learning, but
experiments which tested knowledge based on remembering, rather than learnt
skills, showed only that sleep delays forgetting.
Like most exciting results, the Israeli experiments confirm some old ideas
and raise new questions. Brain pathways using the chemical acetylcholine are
activated during dreaming sleep and during the waking state. This confirms
that acetylcholine is important in forming memory. Karni and Sagi suggest
that all our memories may be laid down by the same mechanism.
Different types of learning take place in different parts of the brain. So,
patients who suffer damage to a region of the brain called the hippocampus
are unable to learn explicit knowledge, such as lists or people's names.
Such amnesics can retrieve old memories, but they cannot learn new
knowledge, although they can acquire skills.
Amnesics have normal short-term memory. They can remember a string of
numbers for hours by rehearsing them continuously, but if they are
distracted, they will forget them completely.
To test the size of your own short-term memory read the following string of
numbers once, then shut your eyes and repeat them aloud: 4, 4, 5, 2, 7, 1,
4. Most people can manage a seven-digit string, but 11 digits - 0, 5, 4, 8,
1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 6, 2 - are too many, although much longer strings can be
stored in long-term memory.
The hippocampus is involved in transferring information from short to
long-term memory, but the location of long-term memory is something of a
mystery. It cannot be the hippocampus, because amnesics can still recall old
memories.
The mechanism of forgetting is also unknown. Scientists are divided on
whether memories are ever truly forgotten, or whether they simply become
impossible to retrieve.
The new experiments give no support to the idea that we can learn by playing
tape recordings while we sleep. According to Professor Jim Horne of the
Sleep Research Laboratory at Loughborough University, learning only occurs
if the tape recorder wakes you up.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Arts: A 'Loose Ends' for eggheads - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Something should be done about Melvyn Bragg, if not to him. The rumour is
that a producer's diktat went out to the effect that he must be more
abrasive: if it was the producer who supports Arsenal, as revealed on
Monday's Start the Week, it merely confirms one's opinion of her judgment.
From a civilised arbiter of argument, coaxing the best from his guests,
Bragg has become a bully, slapping down those he disagrees with and giving
short shrift to those he considers, not always rightly, to be fools. It is a
little like Brian Hayes in his old LBC days, but without the sense of craggy
integrity.
There is something innately plush about Melv. He is too comfortable with
himself, which makes the discomfort he inflicts on others unacceptable; less
a rigorous crusade for truth than mandarin contempt for inferiors. And while
Hayes' victims rang in, choosing confrontation, the guests on STW have
presumably been invited because they have something to say. I would hate to
think they were being set up.
On Monday, initial boredom at the prospect of a newspaper journalist telling
us why she had given her television away was replaced by outraged sympathy
as she was verbally jostled by the assembled company of the media-wise,
seldom permitted to make her points in full, and assailed by such
intellectual attacks as Melv's dismissive assertion that all the people he
knows who say they hate television are very stupid people. So there. Melv is
of course a TV magnate, a well-known screen personality and rich with it. No
one could call him stupid.
Far from dispelling the air of self-congratulation that is turning STW into
a Loose Ends for eggheads, Melv's acerbity accentuates it in some of his
guests. PJ O'Rourke was a disappointment after his writing, the breezy
bonhomme that one dreads getting cornered by at parties, rolling along on
autopilot chuckling facetiousness and woolly generalisations.
But it has been a depressing week for the communicating classes. Mediumwave
chatted to the British brat-pack of directors who, despite the death of our
native film industry, are doing well in Hollywood. Little Action Men, every
one, saying things like 'I want to be very, very rich', not wanting to make
films appealing to a minority and boasting of being the first video (ie not
lettered) generation - well, why not if that's where the future lies? But
what became of art? At least Melv is keen on that.
Struggles to communicate have recurred in the Radio 3 programmes on the
distaff and the stave, Pride and Prejudice - a Celebration of Women
Composers. They almost qualify, as a class, for Radio 4's Scapegoats.
Tuesday's programme featured music and words from Judith Weir, restrained,
ironic and articulate on the double handicap of being a serious composer and
a woman.
Some fascinating sounds, many new to me, from composers mitteleuropaisch and
points north. But arguing about whether women's music is intrinsically
different from men's strikes me as on a par with extracting sunbeams from
cucumbers.
We all know that the sexes both bang the big drum these post-Glennie days.
It would be interesting to compare the sexes' percussion styles, a thought
prompted by Radio 3's artist of the week. James Blades started in cinemas
and circuses and ended as a favourite of Benjamin Britten.
Besides showpieces, the week's well-chosen snippets included that ominous
passage in The Turn of the Screw where the governess muses about her new job
and a frantic throbbing underlines her nervousness, tightening the suspense
unbearably.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Arts: Welsh Yeomen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The very Englishness of it all only underlines the irony. Through a thick
London fog a beefeater arrives to start the show: a cut-out curtain shaped
like the Tower of London rises to reveal the huge red-and-white cross of the
English flag draped across the stage.
The twist is that the venue is in Wales. While English opera companies seem
to have lost interest in Gilbert and Sullivan, Welsh National Opera is
taking up the cause instead. This new production of The Yeomen of the Guard
is the first G&amp;S in the company's history and - to emphasise the irony
further - will be the first ever to be staged at the Royal Opera House, when
WNO takes it on tour there next year. The production is also shared with
Glimmerglass Opera in the US.
All this suggests that WNO is confident about what it has taken on. Opera
companies essaying G&amp;S for the first time often find the experience
chastening, because they treat it as slapstick and promptly fall flat on
their face. The Yeomen of the Guard, in particular, is a comparatively sober
entertainment and for that reason resistant to vulgar treatment.
In case its producer slipped on a banana skin, WNO wisely took out
insurance. The cast includes one G&amp;S veteran, a younger G&amp;S specialist and
several of the most experienced stage artists in opera today. Donald Adams
made his debut as principal bass with the D'Oyly Carte at the New Theatre,
Cardiff, back in 1953, so returning to the theatre 40 years later to play
Sergeant Meryll again must bring back memories. He is the consummate
professional.
After his Ko-Ko in London, Richard Suart has G&amp;S patter on the tip of his
tongue (sometimes close to leaving Gareth Jones behind in the pit). His Jack
Point in this Yeomen looks crestfallen when he walks on and is crushed into
a cowering loser by the end, as always a physically telling portrayal. A
melodramatic lighting plan catches Felicity Palmer's face at her entrance,
sculpting a skeletal mask for her fearsome Dame Carruthers, but then
everything this singer does on stage commands attention.
Alwyn Mellor and Neill Archer play naturally together, without too much
Edwardian winsomeness, as Elsie Maynard and Colonel Fairfax. Pamela Helen
Stephen's Phoebe combines temptress and innocent in one, though her
seductive singing gives the temptress the upper hand; the big voice of
Donald Maxwell makes his Shadbolt an unusually dominating character.
Wherever their personalities come across strongly, Tim Hopkins as the
producer must take a share of the credit. The best of his production,
designed by Peter J. Davison, comes when the words are allowed to make their
points unaided and there are mercifully few unwanted visual gags deforming
the script, like red noses planted on Gilbert's portrait. Only the restless
choreography gets on one's nerves. The chorus behave like mechanical
puppets, but with any luck their batteries will have gone flat before the
show reaches London.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Arts: Caribbean carnival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the Cochrane Theatre, the black Talawa company has found another offbeat
Christmas show to stage. This year it is Sylvia Wynter's Maskarade, with
music by Olive Lewin, which recreates a Jamaican street festival known as
'Jonkunnu'. (Nobody is quite sure why, but it may commemorate a man called
John Canoe.) For colour and verve, Yvonne Brewster's production scores high;
there is a certain intelligibility problem with the Jamaican dialect, but
that rather enhances the exotic charm of the piece.
The setting is Kingston in 1841, a year in which the Mayor rashly decided to
ban the Jonkunnu parade. The civil disorder that resulted barely crops up in
Maskarade, however, for it is not a political show. In the first act we
watch the local citizenry preparing for the carnival, planning their
costumes, jockeying for the best roles in the mummers' play; in the second,
we get the play itself, declaimed in quaint rhetoric amid a swirl of
fantastical costumes.
Those, like the stereotyped folk-characters who prance and revel in them,
carry half-remembered echoes from all over: Africa, courtly Europe, pure
local fantasy. The cast of ten - all-singing, all-dancing  - project
everything with terrific gusto, even when what they have to say is opaque to
non-Caribbean ears. (The Caribbean part of the audience relished many things
that passed the rest of us by.) This is a thoroughly professional cast, by
the way, not just talented amateurs, and any West Indian connections they
have probably go back a generation or two.
There are a lot of appealing songs, simple and mostly short, accompanied by
a trio sitting high on one side of Ellen Cairns' pretty set (an arrangement
of screens and straw carnival-figures). There are lively fusillades of
drumming. The whole show takes less than two hours, and ends with a touching
lament. Children might mind not being able to figure out just what, exactly,
is going on; but if they don't, they will probably enjoy everything else
about Maskarade.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Arts: Surrealist show-cases - William Packer lifts the lid
on the latest exhibition at the Whitechapel gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We live out our lives with boxes from the cradle to the grave. By whatever
they hold, they describe and define what we are and would be, our fears and
hopes. We have only to lift the lid, open the box to discover who knows what
treasure, or secret, or horror. 'Open the box, OPEN THE BOX]' shrieks the
audience in gleeful anticipation.
Christmas boxes, chocolate boxes, match boxes, tool boxes, soap boxes, toy
boxes, dressing-up boxes, hat boxes, paint boxes, cigar boxes, knife boxes,
button boxes, shoe boxes, jewel boxes, pill boxes, make-up boxes, fuse boxes
 -we could go on with the list for ever.
For boxes mean lists too, and categories and collections - boxes full of sea
shells from those far-off beaches of childhood; cabinet drawers full of
birds' eggs plucked and blown so carefully in days before ornithological
correctness; match boxes full of beetles, spiders, moths and butterflies.
There is the remembered feel and rustle of tissue paper and cotton-wool, the
pulling open, the unwrapping, the oh so gentle picking up.
Boxes also mean the festivals, the games and discoveries of childhood, the
presents, the parties, the dressing up, the illicit searchings and
adventures through attics and cupboards, dressing-tables and
chests-of-drawers.
Small wonder then that artists should draw directly upon this common stock
of memory and experience. To surrealists in particular, including our
latter-day conceptualists, the box has been an obvious and constant theme.
There it is, to be taken as it is found, its contents ready-made. Or again
it is taken as it is but left unopened, declared by its label only in
imaginative possibility. Or yet again the label is the artist's own, and the
contents to be taken on trust. Or the contents, as the artist has supplied
them, are revealed or hinted at, the box itself become a stage or theatre in
miniature, quite literally a show-case.
The emphases and combinations are limitless in possibility, and any
exhibition of such work, whether brilliantly or indifferently chosen and
presented, can hardly fail to be fascinating. Indeed the material is so
dense that any particular disappointment may be immediately shrugged off for
the treat that follows. This show at Whitechapel, ending a national tour, is
true to that form and indeed holds many not just fascinating but beautiful
things.
Joseph Cornell, with his quietly theatrical and ambiguous narratives, sets
the pace, and from Schwitters' flattened cigarette carton, and such as Man
Ray, Eileen Agar, Arman, Meret Oppenheim, Louise Nevelson, Jiri Kolar and
Martial Raysse, to Earnshaw and Raynaud, surrealism supplies the substance
of the show. The upshot is that interest and surprise lie less in the nature
of the work than in its particular quality and in the artist who produced
it. I was especially intrigued by Avis Newman's little box of snails set in
waxed compartments, and delighted to see Fred Stiven's small and mysterious
boxed abstractions, self-effacing to a fault, given their proper prominence
at last.
But all that said, and the works of some of the artists - Cornell,
Schwitters, Stiven, Kolar and one or two others - excepted, one cannot but
come away feeling just a little let down. For so much of it seems amusing
enough, and clever, but also arch and self-conscious, easy and arbitrary, as
though anything else would have done just as well.
We are back to the tray of birds' eggs and the box of sea shells, and to the
drawers and cabinets full of nails and screws and clips and bolts in the
old-fashioned ironmonger's shop.
Worlds in a Box: Whitechapel Art Gallery, Whitechapel High Street E1, until
February 12; a National Touring Exhibition from the South Bank, sponsored by

FT  17 DEC 94 / Arts: Midnight after a hard day in the House - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC Director-General, John Birt himself, is said to the be the man
responsible for the launch of The Midnight Hour, a late-night BBC2 studio
discussion designed to 'review the parliamentary day'. It could be a smart
move. The BBC already boasts of 'setting the agenda' in the morning with the
Today programme on Radio 4 which goes out at just about the only time when
politicians, top executives and other 'opinion formers' are available to
listen. Midnight is often the only time that such people manage to see a bit
of television, so if The Midnight Hour catches on the BBC will be able to
claim that they are the gatekeepers at both ends of the political day.
But will it catch on? Launched on the evening of the State Opening of
Parliament, it has so far had five weeks of four-day transmissions (Monday
to Thursday) and has already improved considerably. For instance, the
production team seem, thank goodness, to have ditched the 'funny' song
illustrating the day's events. This idea is re-invented every time anybody
does a studio commentary series but the only times it ever worked were on
the Tonight programme in 1957 when Cy Grant sang calypsos written by Bernard
Levin, and on That Was The Week in 1962 when the scat intro was sung by the
brilliant Millicent Martin.
The producers of The Midnight Hour should now abandon their other
security-blanket devices: the fluorescent tube logo which was so trendy in
the 1980s, the cocktail bar mini-set guaranteed to make any politician look
as though he is about to do a high-stool Dicky Valentine number, and the
barmy inlay of a giant tropical fish tank which would hardly pass muster on
a yoof series. No image on television is more powerful than a talking head
against a black background and that is what they should stick to. Even the
gimmick of making the men take off their jackets can be safely dropped; we
know within two minutes whether we are watching a genuinely relaxed
conversation or a tense and contrived interview.
This depends largely on the skills of the chairman who should, ideally, have
been Vincent Hanna. At Newsnight, A Week In Politics and most recently on
Channel 4's Midnight Specials, Hanna has developed a technique combining
amiable conspiracy and rib-nudging ridicule which is admirably productive
with most politicians. He also has a phenomenal memory for political
minutiae.
However, The Midnight Hour has gone for a different chairman on each of the
four nights, the best of them being former Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil,
and Trevor Phillips, who has done outstanding work as producer and presenter
with London Weekend TV. Both are political journalists with considerable
broadcasting experience, and although Neil's instincts are those of a
political commentator, the squibs he tosses from the chair land pretty well
equally in all parts of the political spectrum.
The same cannot be said of Bernard Ingham who looks and sounds like a
survivor from a different age, but, worse, seems too often incapable of
setting aside his political allegiance. Most tedious of all, he likes to
remind us of his old glory days.
Sarah Baxter may one day fill positions of this sort splendidly, but at
present she lacks those attributes of a rugby forward which are necessary in
these circumstances. It is not a simple question of masculinity - the
decidedly feminine Betty Boothroyd has it, as she proved on the night of the
dramatic VAT vote when she bawled out MPs for crowding in over the bar of
the House and thundered 'I don't give a  - I don't care where you sit, but
you must sit down'. And they did.
The Midnight Hour has proved that it can attract cabinet ministers and their
shadows, camera pleasers such as Tony Banks, and respected war horses such
as Peter Shore. The atmosphere is beginning to feel right, and if they can
establish the idea that this is the place to let your hair down after a hard
day in the House (a few indiscreet leaks would be handy) this could well
become a long term fixture. It is the most interesting post-midnight series
for years.

At the end of Fast and Dirty - the collective results of a five-week
experimental theatre workshop initiated by the mixed media performance
ensemble, Second Stride, and presented at Whitechapel's Curtain Theatre  -
the artistic director, Ian Spink, bounds on stage and invites the audience
to join him and the performers at a nearby pub.
Although the suggestion veers uncomfortably close to that brand of
luvvies-at-the-cutting-edge liberalism in which woolly, post-performance
debate between creators and public is marketed as a form of personal growth
for all, Spink throws it our way with the kind of admirable folly and
spontaneity which, judging by the evening's miscellaneous offerings, appears
to have inspired most of Fast and Dirty's participants.
Take, for instance, the prologue to a series of untitled voice and movement
improvisations featuring the eight members of Group 2. Bungling but prudent
ringleader Phelim McDermott instructs the assembled crew of actors, dancers,
and musicians to be 'positive about other people's ideas . . . be available
. . . be sparing with words . . . and, if all else fails, to ask for lights
out.'
In the first of the group's enjoyable juvenile efforts, two men jostle and
prance around the lolling body of a woman who reaches out in vain for
assistance. In the second scene, McDermott mobilises various body parts - an
elbow, a knee, even his eyes - in the ridiculously exaggerated manner of a
bad mime artist or novice dance student. But his most absurd contortions are
reserved for 'doctor's' orders to 'move (his) intention'.
In another episode, a duet for two women dissolves in an orchestrated attack
of coughing and sniffing, the prelude to a run of physical endurance testing
which, although mainly for McDermott, sends his colleagues into fits of
barmy aggression, forcing an immediate curtailment of all activity.
The continual threat of chaos, so amusingly manipulated by the performers,
is perfectly balanced by the unexpected moments of impotence and fear that
characterise all true forms of improvisation and experiment.
The performers feed on and savour those moments. In the final tableau, an
unseen schoolteacher is heard admonishing a pupil. 'I want you to come out
in front of the whole class and dance,' says the teacher, a command which
prompts instant paralysis and strikes a chord of comic-horror with
immaculate ease.
Less is left to chance in the first item of the evening, a collaboration -
entitled I Would Be Desirable - between director Hilary Westlake,
choreographer Sue MacLennan and composer Fabienne Audeoud, involving two
actors, two dancers and a singer.
Working around a single, unanswerable question, 'If I were you, who would
you be?', the performers evolve and dissect their own language of physical
and verbal communication. Their faces are shown in close-up on a bank of
video screens which later accommodate edited footage of an encounter between
the dancing couple, Julien Joly and Gill Lyon. At a bistro table, one man
interrogates another to no avail, eventually storming off-stage only to
return disguised in a woolly hat and all-in-one plastic glasses, eyebrows
and nose.
Themes of mistaken identity and jumbled memory colour the intervening text
for two speakers, who, revising their stories as they recite them, are
periodically thumped by their respective silent partners.
Fragments, the two-part closing work directed by Lucy Bailey and Ian Spink
for a third group of performers, is the most impenetrable piece on the
programme.
Based on selected texts written in diary form by an unnamed 20-year-old
woman, it lures you into a dangerously unpredictable fantasy world of
dopplegangers, alter egos and evil spirits.
In her bedroom, a woman dressed in a night gown and prone to intermittent
bouts of furious scribbling is visited by Lizzie Saunderson's Babushka, a
collector of dirty laundry, by a musician who outstays her welcome, and by
the oddball couple (Linda Dobell and Liz Ranken) who, as the woman's
parents, display an even greater tendency towards lunatic behaviour than
their disturbed daughter.
Ranken (the father) turns into a convincingly semi-rabid dog but, having
regained his/her composure, is later to be seen drowning under a black sea
constructed from plastic bin-liners. And just when the storm of slamming
doors and hysterical exchanges seems to be blowing over, Desiree
Cherrington's mute diabolist springs to frightening life, clambering on to
the desk and up the wall.
As Spink explains in his introduction to the evening's events, the act of
presenting such raw, newly formed work demands a two-way negotiation of the
process-versus-product argument.
Over the past few years, many performers have stressed the importance of
funding for research and development. But are such embryonic creations of
any interest to an audience? Work as intellectually mature and focused as
Second Stride's Fast and Dirty contributions offers, even in its unfinished
state, a revealing insight into the perils and delights of theatre which is
led by opportunity, accident and instinct.
As McDermott points out in his round-up of performance possibilities: 'Some
people (in the group) might never come on stage.'
But that, he reminds us, 'is a valuable contribution to a piece, sometimes.'
Second Stride's next project, Badenheim, will tour from autumn 1995.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Arts: Our premier theatrical fruitcake - Ian Shuttleworth
talks to Ken Campbell, the lunatic genius of the fringe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN SHUTTLEWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy to deduce which of the new houses by the River Lea in North
London is inhabited by Ken Campbell: it is the one with the plaque of a
flying pig by the front door. The interior decor is similarly outre,
consisting largely of items of set from his various stage shows. How can he
bear to live in the same room as an enormous portrait of John Birt, director
general of the BBC? 'Well, I have a set of darts . . .'
Less straightforward, though, is the task of explaining in measured,
comprehensible terms just why Campbell has become so cherished as Britain's
premier theatrical fruitcake. His series of surreal one-man stage shows
rummages through the bottom drawers of culture, science and an assortment of
bizarre notions has endeared him to audiences and critics alike. Since
staging what was then his trio of solo rambles at the National Theatre last
year (he dubbed it 'the Bald trilogy' to compete with the theatre's
concurrent Hare trilogy), Campbell has discovered that 'I don't get writer's
blocks, I get writer's flux,' and the trilogy is now a
quintet-going-on-sextet. If you have ever felt the need of a batch of
easy-to-digest, psychotically seductive crash courses in Fortean phenomena,
to name but a few of the topics covered, Campbell is the weirdo you have
been looking for.
This may all sound uncomfortably like the man who sits heavily beside you on
the bus and begins to complain loudly that 'They' are spying on him with
rays, but Ken Campbell has ploughed his particular curlicued furrows over
many years and in a number of theatrical fields. From beginnings in
repertory theatre (recalled in his show Mystery Bruises with a learned
analysis of why the other characters in Macbeth ignore the Thane of Angus -
'Do they not see him? Is he a dwarf?'), he went on to do a stint as stooge
to Dick Emery on a stage tour, then to 'the baths: I was director of the
Bournemouth Aqua Show . . . well, of the shallow-end acting bit.
'The writing took off in the mid-60s when I was understudying Warren
Mitchell. I showed him a play I'd written for kids called Events Of An
Average Bath Night, and we put it on in the RADA theatre. They had a notion
at the time of putting professional shows on there and it didn't work, and
that one particularly didn't work. But then I wrote a number of TV plays
within a year, and they all got done.'
A period at the Royal Court was followed by the first outbreak of virulent,
infectious Campbellian idiosyncrasy: the Ken Campbell Roadshow. 'The first
show was with Bob Hoskins, and was notable for being based on urban
folk-myths, vanishing grandmother, ghost hitch-hiker, all that stuff - and
the second was notable for putting my ferrets down Sylvester McCoy's
trousers. Bob had so much talent; he could have been a great comic, you
know, like Jerry Lewis, Norman Wisdom, proper crap comedy, but he decided to
go and be gangsters. He's been rather successful at it, so I can't knock the
decision.'
The Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool (1976-80), under Campbell's
artistic direction, provided the opening show for the National Theatre's
Cottesloe space in the form of a nine-hour stage adaption of the Illuminatus
novels, and took the world record for longest continuous play with The Warp
at 22 hours: 'It consisted of ten separate dramas, each with its own title,
but they were so weird that nobody ever knew them; The Winds Howling Through
Tiflis was one, I don't know why it was called that but I didn't want to
look thick so I never asked.' SF activities continued into his tour of duty
at the helm of Liverpool's Everyman Theatre.
Add to this cv a clutch of acting roles as diverse as Alf Garnett's
neighbour Fred Johnson in BBC sitcom In Sickness And In Health, a man who
shoves a rotting prawn down comedian Jim Davidson's throat in Peter
Greenaway's A Zed And Two Noughts and a crooked solicitor in A Fish Called
Wanda, and Campbell would appear to possess a formidable array of talents.
He denies it: 'I can write a bit; I can direct, but I only really enjoy
directing something that nobody else will, I don't want to join the
who-can-do-The-Cherry-Orchard-best competition.'
The solo shows began by chance when he asked to plug a scheduling hole in
Camden's Offstage Downstairs studio theatre in 1988, and 'all I could think
of was an evening of reminiscence, nattering about things that had happened
to me. Then I went onto Robert McKee's storycraft course, and there's a
moment where he says, 'A story is a bigger thing than life itself, way
beyond mere reminiscence,' so I thought, 'Oh well, I'd better make a story,
then,' and bunged a fib or two in.' And the rest is history, albeit a
distinctly unorthodox version.
Work in the pipeline includes a commission from the National Theatre for
solo show number six, which apparently concerns 'mystic geography: sometimes
out of the blue somebody will way something like, 'You must go to
Kathmandu,' or somewhere you'd never really thought of going - well, I've
got a few I have to follow up.
'But I think (the solo work) might be coming to an end. I've got a faint
feeling this one might be a bit different: a one-man show with some other
people in it.'
In February Channel 4 screens Reality On The Rocks, a three-part popular
science series in which narrator Campbell explains matters such as 'the
expanding universe, how time is curved, and listening to the echoes of the
Big Bang through this gramophone horn thing.' He also gives elocution tips
to Professor Stephen Hawking: 'I said, 'That voice they've given you's
rather good, it's got some humour in it,' and he said 'YES', and I said, . .
. 'except when you say yes, they ought to give you the option of a campy yes
or an ironic one,' and he went, 'MAYBE'.'
But what aspect of his work gives him most satisfaction? 'Well, there's a
party on Friday I'm looking forward to . . .'
Ken Campbell's solo shows are performed consecutively next week at the
Cockpit Theatre, NW8.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Arts: Popular restoration - David Murray finds a fresh and
clear approach in Man of Mode
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
George Etherege's acrid comedy, playing in judicious tandem with Stephen
Jeffrey's The Libertine at the Royal Court, gets a pretty well faultless
production from Max Stafford-Clark. (The plays share their casts and sets as
well as their director.) The first recorded staging of The Man of Mode was
in 1676, and it was popular for 50 years; but later ages began to find it
immoral and nasty, and after 1766 it seems not to have been revived until
this century.
It is easy enough to see why it aroused discomfort. Even its happy ending
has a bitter edge: bed-hopping Dorimant weds Harriet because he truly loves
her, but also because he needs her estate ' and until the final moments, his
brutally discarded mistress and his younger paramour are at the party. In
fact the play's hero is by a long way its most calculating and disillusioned
character. A contemporary assessment of it as 'an agreeable representation
of the persons of condition of both sexes, both in court and town' fairly
takes one's breath away.
Even by the high standards of Restoration comedy, the text is notably witty
and literate, and Stafford-Clark's eleven-strong cast do it proud. Though it
is played with unhesitating speed, nobody's tongue trips, and every phrase
cuts cleanly through the air.
Public behaviour is just as important, for it is endlessly discussed, mocked
and indeed carefully illustrated at several points: it is what everybody
most cares about. The cast get it beautifully right, never falling into
slovenly modern ways but never into 'period' campery either ' not even Sir
Fopling Flutter, who in the person of Tim Potter is so touchingly confident
of not being the prancing idiot that he is, that he never looks like a
caricature. Apart from its immorality, the most startlingly modern aspect of
the play is the extreme, critical self-consciousness of nearly everyone else
about his and her feelings. Again and again a character stands back from
himself and discusses his own mechanism like a clinical researcher. David
Westhead's slightly truculent dryness is nicely adapted to Dorimant in that
mode; Katrina Levon's cast-off mistress, Mrs Lovett, does it in bursts of
violent passion.
There are no weak links. Amanda Drew makes a fresh but properly
clear-sighted heiress Harriet (with a pretty whiff of the innocent
countryside about her), Cathyrn Bradshaw a wry, fetching paramour. There is
a doughty father Bellair from Bernard Gallagher, whose comic timing is
excellent, and Barnaby Kay plays his son ' Dorimant's best friend ' with
doggy eyes and a defenceless face, which contrasts with Dorimant's style.
Jason Watkins plays Medley, a witty friend, sharply, and makes a rapturous,
irresistible aria out of his description of Harriet.
Peter Hartwell's sets are plain, economical and effective, and his costumes
impeccably apt for the people they dress. John Baxter's group dances at the
start and finish of the second act are infectious enough to make one want to
join in; helpfully, the cast encourages two or three audience members to do
just that, on stage. It did not feel like a gimmick. In several respects,
this Man of Mode is the most intelligent and rewarding Restoration revival
I've seen in years.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Arts: Elgar's Dream
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Sunday at the Barbican The Dream of Gerontius received a welcome
dusting-off. Ever since its premiere in 1900, Elgar's masterpiece has been a
repeated victim of the 'English Choral Tradition'; many of the finest
interpretations have come from outside that tradition and taken a broader
view of the music, whose roots are firmly in the mainstream late-Romantic
idiom.
Few English conductors are better qualified to approach the work from that
direction than Colin Davis, who brought vast operatic and symphonic
experience to what may well have been his first Gerontius.
With a trio of soloists not normally associated with Elgar, and the London
Symphony Orchestra and Chorus on splendid form, Davis was able to take a
'new' look at the piece. It emerged as a giant symphonic poem for soloists,
chorus and orchestra'significant, since Elgar never termed it an 'oratorio'.
Davis's approach was clear right from the Prelude, in which some of the
orchestral textures took on a surprisingly diaphanous glow. He also revealed
a feeling for Elgarian rubato, a barely perceptible give-and-take in tempo
rather than the mannered gesture that all too often disturbs the music's
flow.
He filled in dramatic detail without unsettling the broad sweep of the
music. Tempos were generally relaxed, except in the viscerally exciting
Demon's Chorus, which for once sounded properly demonic. Elsewhere, the
chorus excelled itself with controlled, still singing.
All three soloists supplied the almost operatic dimension the composer
sought. Thomas Moser was a full-toned Gerontius who, after a slightly
tentative start, sounded like Elgar's 'worldly man'. ('I've not filled his
part with Church tunes and rubbish but a good, healthy full-blooded
romantic, remembered worldliness,' wrote Elgar.) Anthony Michaels-Moore sang
eloquently in his two roles, his baritone slightly roughened by a cold but
nevertheless imposing.
As the Angel, Anne Sofie von Otter - a refined mezzo far removed from what
has become the 'gallon-jug' tradition of this music - sang with radiant
warmth rather than fervour. This is new territory for von Otter and her
voice is perhaps a little light for some of Elgar's thickly-scored climaxes,
but throughout her part, and especially in the Angel's Farewell - over which
Davis lingered magically - she maintained her poise.
The projected Philips recording with Davis and these forces will be a
valuable addition to the Gerontius discography.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Books: Ethnic bricks exposed - JDF Jones on the difficult
role of the Zulus in the new South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JDF JONES

<TEXT>
SHAKA'S CHILDREN by Stephen Taylor HarperCollins Pounds 18, 416 pages
Just a couple of years ago, the guest of honour at a luncheon in the
officers' mess of the South Wales Borderers in Brecon was an ancient and
distinguished Zulu gentleman called Magqubu. He and the colonel toasted each
other and reminisced about the exploits of their forefathers in the
Anglo-Zulu War of 1879, when - the stuff of legend - at Isandhlwana and
Rorke's Drift, assegai-wielding impis gave a nasty shock to the pride of the
British Empire. Here in Brecon warrior-nation (in decline) saluted
warrior-nation (ditto).
The colonel was not so rude as to point out that that unequal conflict dealt
a fatal blow to the Empire's most picturesque and legend-worthy ethnic
group, militant tribesmen eulogised by Rider Haggard and other writers,
respected for their (alleged) dignity, stoicism, generosity, honesty,
elemental and intuitive integrity, etc, and at the same time notorious for
their bloody barbarity. (It was in this minor war that the young Louis
Napoleon, the Prince Imperial, met his end, occasioning Disraeli's remark,
'A wonderful people, the Zulus. They beat our generals, then convert our
bishops, and they write finis to a French dynasty . . .')
The fact is that the Zulus, who had emerged from obscurity to notoriety
under Shaka at the beginning of the 19th century, plunged after 1879 into a
decline from which they have only just escaped. Their place in the modern
world is still not clear; and they are at the very heart of the South
African political drama today.
Stephen Taylor's book, Shaka's Children, is therefore very timely. His
thesis is that 'once the cement of apartheid, which had bonded together the
foes of white domination, was lost, the ethnic bricks that made up this
diverse and complex nation would be exposed . . .' Looking at the events of
1994, it is impossible to disagree; South Africa will have to reconcile its
tribes to the future - and the trickiest will be the Afrikaners and the
Zulus.
The Zulus, or rather the Inkatha party of Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, joined in
the April election at the last imaginable moment and made a good showing at
the (rather dubious) polls, as a result of which the increasingly-impossible
chief is - at the moment of writing - in Cabinet. But Zululand is the
shakiest card in the new South African pack, as president Mandela (a Xhosa)
is well aware, and the history of this arrogant and impressive people, the
largest ethnic group in the country, is highly relevant.
Taylor's first 250 pages is a straight-down-the-middle story which is
competently, even elegantly, done, always readable and pleasantly
un-academic. He then tackles the post-1879 period and gets a bit unfocused -
this becomes not so much history as extended journalism, which is probably
inevitable because he has to pose questions rather than recount the answers.
He hangs on to the point that the Zulus are not a homogenous people and have
for a century been split between traditionalists (strongest in the north, in
the kraals) and (Christian, educated, southern) urbanites. In different ways
Buthelezi and King Goodwill (a Christian polygamist now being courted by the
ANC government) represent two ways of bridging this division, which was
downplayed until recently because, so long as the white government
emphasised ethnicity under apartheid, anyone hostile to that government was
bound to decline to endorse that ethnic view of South African society. But
this is a new world and the Zulus' place in it will have to be sorted out,
which means that the division in the tribe will have to be resolved. It
would of course have been so much easier if Britain had reserved Zululand
(like Basutoland and Bechuanaland) to its own direct rule many years ago.
Stephen Taylor's account of the Zulus in this century is a little thin - but
maybe he has no significant story to tell. The Xhosas hijacked the ANC at
some stage; Albert Luthuli managed to straddle the traditional/urban Zulu
divide; Buthelezi was a protege of Luthuli but post-1980 his willingness to
associate with Pretoria inevitably turned him into a 'stooge' (and his
opposition to sanctions, Taylor correctly emphasises, was 'a colossal
blunder').
Are there lessons? Nothing encouraging. 'Faction fighting' will continue,
with the appalling and weekly bloodshed that entails. The Tugela River will
continue to divide the Zulu nation. And the fact that there are eight
million Zulus will remain the single most significant element in South
Africa's political future.

MADAME DU DEFFAND AND HER WORLD by Benedetta Craveri Halban Pounds 20, 481
pages
Paris was a place of scandal during the period of the duc d'Orlean's regency
in the early 18th century. Orgies were held in the Regent's rooms every
evening, involving behaviour so lubricious that its contemporary chroniclers
dared not name it.
At the height of the Regent's excesses, shortly before his death, a young
newly-married woman joined his bacchanalia and became his mistress. She was
a sparklingly vivacious, witty woman with beautiful eyes: Marie de
Vichy-Champrond, marquise du Deffand.
This was a spectacular arrival on the social scene for a young woman not
long out of convent school, not long married - and not long separated from
her milk-sop husband. It presaged the rising of a new star in the French
social firmament. Mme du Deffand became one of Paris's great salon
hostesses, and because of her friendships with D'Alembert, Voltaire, the
duchesse de Choiseul, and especially with Horace Walpole, she made
substantial contributions to one of the 18th-century's richest literary
traditions: the art of letter-writing.
In this translation of her much-praised biography, Benedetta Craveri paints
an extraordinarily rich portrait of Mme du Deffand and her world. It is not
a biography in the straightforward sense, so it proves an advantage to know
the outlines of Mme du Deffand's life before reading Craveri, whose primary
concern is with the nuances of the marquise's complex relationships and
their even more complex setting. Craveri explores both through the
marquise's vast surviving correspondence, which shimmers with historical and
literary fascinations.
Mme du Deffand was born into an aristocratic family at Champrond in 1697. At
her convent she preached irreligion to her fellow-pupils, so the Mother
Abbess summoned the great Massillon to correct her. He failed, commenting as
he left 'She is charming]' Her parents married her to a cousin, the marquis
du Deffand, but they soon separated, whereupon Mme du Deffand began her
career of dissipation.
After the Regent's death she was for a long time a companion of the royal
duchesse du Maine, who kept court at her chateau at Sceaux. The chief
pastime there was theatricals. Here Mme du Deffand established her
reputation as a wit and mistress of repartee; and here she enjoyed the best
years of her long-standing affair with Jean-Francois Henault, president of
the parlement of Paris.
It was only in middle-age that Mme du Deffand established her own salon,
based in the secular wing of the convent of St Joseph in Paris. Its handsome
apartments were famously decorated in buttercup yellow watered silk
decorated with flame-coloured bows, which visitors came from all over Europe
to admire.
It was a salon for aristocrats, not savants; with the exceptions of her
lifelong friend Voltaire, D'Alembert - whom for a time she loved - and,
briefly, Rousseau, she hated the philosophes, holding it against Diderot
that he was such an ill-mannered lout that he used inadvertently to kick
Catherine the Great's shins while explaining points of philosophy to her.
Instead, her salon entertained aristocrats increasingly at odds with the new
world of the Enlightenment, who looked back to the manners and values of the
days of Louis XIV.
At the age of 55 Mme du Deffand went blind. (Voltaire said 'she has been
punished whereby she made others sin.') She employed Julie de Lespinasse to
help her run her salon. While the clever and lovely Julie was at her side,
the literati still attended; but then Mme du Deffand discovered that Julie
and D'Alembert were having an affair, and that the literati arrived early to
spend time with Julie on her own; so the women quarrelled, and Julie left,
taking the literati with her.
But the greatest was yet to be. Horace Walpole, gothic novelist son of the
British Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole, became an habitue of Mme du
Deffand's salon, and she - though 20 years his senior - fell in love with
him. Walpole did not return the sentiment, but was drawn to her nonetheless
by her intelligence and perceptive wit. As a result he drew her best work
from her, in the form of letters. By his prompting and example he made Mme
du Deffand reveal in her letters a high order of literary talent.
Mme du Deffand suffered terribly from what she called ennui and she is one
of the first true chroniclers of ennui as an existential agony. But despite
it, she took by sheer force of character and intellect a position at the
centre of French 18th century life, her intimate record of which is not only
one of the great literary achievements of the time, but a great historical
document.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Books: Wild fancies and cultivated pleasures - From jungle
planting to potting sheds, Bridget Bloom enjoys the range of this year's
rich harvest of books about gardening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIDGET BLOOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few winter pleasures are more enjoyable than curling up with a good
gardening book, dreaming of summer. The pleasure is heightened, of course,
if the books are illustrated lavishly, a fire roars in the hearth, and the
curtains are closed against the desolate borders outside.
This year, British publishers have produced a bonanza of such books. Themes
are varied while photographs, plans and plantings seemingly are glossier and
more enticing than ever. The books come with prices to fit every pocket.
I make no apology for starting with four volumes - three new and one
re-issued - devoted to water in the garden: I started dreaming in the summer
of a wild-life pond in my cottage garden; now, thanks to the books, I am
almost at the point of cutting the first sod.
The best of the four is The Water Gardener by Anthony Archer Wills (Frances
Lincoln, Pounds 25, 192 pages) although The Water Garden by Peter Robinson,
in the Royal Horticultural Society Collection series (Conran Octopus Pounds
14.99, 128 pages), runs it a close second.
Both cover step-by-step construction of water features, from the smallest of
trickles to the grandest of formal pools, and both are illustrated with
splendid line drawings and photographs. But Archer Wills scores on the
comprehensiveness of his construction details - he has several pages on
making larger ponds in concrete, which Robinson ignores.
Ponds and Water Gardens by Bill Heritage is a revised second edition of an
already popular paperback and has the advantage of being compact and cheap
at Pounds 5.99 (Cassell, 170 pages).
Creating Water Gardens by Mary Moody, in Anaya's Pleasure of Gardening
series (Pounds 14.99, 128 pages), is perhaps not as comprehensive as the
others; on the other hand, it is the only one to offer good advice on how to
protect your fish from herons, which are serious predators for country
pond-owners (put some terracotta piping on the bottom so the fish can hide
in it).
The next clutch of books deals broadly with garden design - four of them,
coincidentally, by contemporary British designers. Great Gardens, Great
Designers by George Plumptre (Ward Lock Pounds 20, 160 pages) sets the
scene, following the work of the 20th century's mostly grand garden-makers.
Here, among others, are Gertrude Jekyll, Edwin Lutyens, Harold Peto,
Lawrence Johnston, Vita Sackville-West, Geoffrey Jellicoe, Russell Page and
Lanning Roper.
Plumptre - gardening correspondent of The Times - traces the beginnings of
modern garden design in the 19th century and then analyses the essential
tenets of each designer and their principal gardens. It is a handsome book.
John Brookes, one of Britain's top contemporary designers and the only one
to figure prominently in the Plumptre book, urges a 'gentler, natural
approach'. In Planting the Country Way (BBC Books Pounds 18.99, 192 pages),
he urges the gardener to be sensitive, not only to local climate and soil
but also to the local ecology and environment. He pleads for planting and
designs which, while not necessarily using all 'native' plants, avoid 'plots
of hybrid-hued mini-plants'.
Brookes takes a canter through garden history, covering some of the same
ground as Plumptre but in a more practical fashion. He provides plans and
plantings for different types of gardens: an enclosed herb garden or a
garden on exposed downland, in woodland, a valley or even an inhospitable
town.
If you are designing a garden, you might with advantage start with Plumptre
and Brookes and then progress to Rosemary Verey's Garden Plans and Penelope
Hobhouse's On Gardening, both published by Frances Lincoln (Pounds 18.99 and
Pounds 20, 144 and 216 pages respectively).
Both Verey and Hobhouse, grandes dames of the British gardening scene,
eschew 'multi-hued hybrids' in favour of older-established, gentler species.
Verey describes plantings she designed, primarily for classic gardens
(whether Longleat or a manor house in Gloucestershire), but the schemes
would adapt well to the naturalistic approach. There are many good ideas for
vegetable gardens, too.
Hobhouse's book opens with a brief but fascinating essay on her philosophy
of garden design, much influenced by the 'many rooms in one garden' of
Hidcote and Sissinghurst but with dense and exuberant 'jungle planting' to
soften the edges. On Gardening is really a valediction to Tintinhull, the
National Trust garden which Hobhouse revived before moving on recently to a
garden in Devon that sounds (from this book) like a green-field site. There
is much to dream over here.
All these books have excellent photographs and are produced most
attractively, but those qualities apply especially to the last 'designer'
book: Roy Strong's Successful Small Gardens, subtitled 'New designs for
time-conscious gardeners' (Conran Octopus Pounds 17.99, 144 pages).
Strong describes in detail nine gardens which, he reckons, can be maintained
on an hour or two a week plus an annual clear-up; another six needing an
afternoon a week in the growing season; and five specifically for the plant
enthusiast.
Strong's gardens rely heavily on structure: gravel paths, box hedges or
topiary, vases or statues, seats and the like. But he also illustrates a
wild garden in a courtyard to complement the angularity of a modern house;
and a pergola rampant with flowering climbers, with two tiny pools below,
for an awkward city back-yard.
All the gardens analysed are inspirational and all are capable of being
adjusted to suit different sites. And they are real gardens but, sadly,
Strong rarely identifies them or their designers.
Now for a group of smaller, cheaper volumes. Mirabel Osler is an acquired
taste, as she recognises. In her preface to In the Eye of the Garden (JM
Dent Pounds 12.99, 176 pages), she notes that her musings might infuriate
some readers. But I find attractive her mixture of practicalities, humour
and whimsy (marvelling at the throat of a penstemon through a magnifying
glass, or calling for old potting sheds to be listed as endangered species).
The line drawings are as delightful in their own way as are the glossy
photographs in the previous books.
In similar genre are two books from America. Henry Mitchell wrote a
gardening column for the Washington Post newspaper for more than 20 years,
and the Essential Earth Man (Houghton Mifflin, Boston Dollars 10.95, 244
pages) is a memorial anthology. The style is not to everyone's taste but, if
you were a devotee, you will certainly enjoy this one.
Green Thoughts by Eleanor Perenyi is subtitled 'A writer in the garden'
(Pimlico Pounds 9, 279 pages, in UK only). Perenyi, a journalist and
novelist, gardened in Hungary and on the Connecticut coast. With chapters in
alphabetical order, she ranges from annuals, ashes and autumn through
poppies, potatoes and pruning, toads, tomato and tools to a 10-page,
somewhat tongue-in-cheek essay on women in the garden.
If pruning is your bent, incidentally, the book you need is the Complete
Book of Pruning edited by Duncan Coombs (Ward Lock Pounds 12.99, 224 pages).
Everything seems to be covered, including an appendix on your legal right -
or not - to prune your neighbour's trees.
Last in this 'Christmas stocking' category is one book on compost and
another on companion planting. Magic Muck, the Complete Guide to Compost, is
by 'Lady Muck' (alias Jane Down, an enterprising farmer's daughter who could
not get a job and decided to process farm slurry into compost for gardeners;
she also bred worms).
All you need to know about both these subjects is covered in a book which is
written entertainingly and illustrated nicely with line drawings by Tim
Coath (Pavilion Pounds 9.99, 104 pages, in UK only).
The Companion Garden by Bob Flowerdew is (as television guru Alan Titchmarsh
says on the cover) 'packed with really good, down-to-earth advice on the
practicalities of planting one type of plant with another for mutual
benefit'. It is also illustrated prettily and priced competitively (Kyle
Cathie Pounds 5.99, 96 pages).
Meanwhile, if rock gardens are your thing, you have a choice of two volumes
from the latest lists. One by Mary Moody, in the Anaya Pleasure of Gardening
series, is called Rockeries and Alpine Gardens (Pounds 14.99, 127 pages).
The other, in the excellent RHS Collection by Christopher Grey-Wilson, is
titled The Alpine Garden (Pounds I5.99, 128 pages).
While the latter has a good introduction on alpines in the wild, both cover
a dozen or so different types of alpine garden with construction,
propagation and planting tips. Both are well-illustrated, as is The Dry
Garden (Pounds 15.99, 128 pages) by Mark Rumary. This is also in the RHS
Collection, a series of a dozen practical guides to planning and planting
which have been published over the past year or two.
Any one would be a good present; the whole lot would set up a gardener
almost for life.

<TEXT>
THE RISE AND FALL OF THE GRENVILLES, DUKES OF BUCKINGHAM AND CHANDOS
1710-1921 by John Beckett Manchester University Press Pounds 45 (Pounds
14.99 pbk), 320 pages
This excellent account of aristocratic finances will confirm John Beckett's
already high reputation as the leading scholar of the modern English
aristocracy. He concentrates on the financial and social fortunes of the
Grenvilles whose trajectory was more spectacular than that of most
aristocratic families.
In 1710 they were a Buckinghamshire gentry family with a relatively modest
seat at Wotton. By 1822, when they gained the long-sought dukedom, the
Grenvilles owned over 70,000 acres, two large London houses and five country
seats. Yet their fall was also spectacular. Thanks to debts of over Pounds
1m by 1845 the family lost most of their land and in 1889 the dukedom became
extinct. The great house of Stowe was sold in 1921 and became a public
school.
Beckett offers an essentially chronological account of this process. His
study benefits from a formidable account of archival research. He skilfully
integrates economic and social history and is alert to many other factors,
ranging from landscape development to the benefits of political opportunity.
The nature of an aristocratic dynasty is ably discussed: a succession of
male heirs, with few other dependants, was crucial.
Beckett is also alive to the importance of the role of personalities. For
example, Temple's desire to recreate the Dorset estate of Bubb Dodington
made little sense other than in terms of his pertinacious personality. The
Marquess Buckingham was obsessed with gaining a dukedom. The First and
Second Dukes of Buckingham spent and thought nothing of massive debate. The
First Duke married the heiress of the Duke of Chandos in 1796 and from her,
and his father, had a rent roll of over Pounds 70,000: but the Duke's
collecting, electioneering and houses ensured that he always lived beyond
his means. He was extravagant and was swiftly involved in a spiral of debts.
The Duke exacerbated the problem by neglecting the estates and fraudulently
interfering with the settlements. By late 1832 four-fifths of his income was
going into paying interest charges. In 1833 a trust was created to run the
Grenville estates. The Duke prepared to take an extended cruise only to find
he had used the yacht as security for loans, and before he could leave port
it was sequestered.
The Second Duke was similarly dishonest, precipitating a crisis in 1847 that
set peer against heir. His debts led to his loss of control over his estates
and he spent his final years as a pensioner, living on money provided by his
son and anything he could borrow.
The Third Duke had no sons, but his caution and efforts ensured that he left
no debts. However, Richard Morgan-Grenville, the heir to Stowe, died in the
Great War, and Lady Kinloss, who neither needed nor could afford Stowe,
arranged for its sale.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Finance Week): Business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS
Labour trounced the Conservatives in the Dudley West by-election, its
candidate winning a 20,694 majority. The Conservatives lost their fourth
seat of the present parliament after an astonishing 29 per cent swing - the
biggest from the Tories to Labour since 1935.
National Lottery organiser Camelot found itself embroiled in controversy as
shadow home secretary Jack Straw accused it of laying 'a trail of clues
about the identity' of last weekend's Pounds 17,880,003 jackpot winner, who
had said he wished to remain anonymous. He is a married factory worker from
the north of England with three children.
The Office of Fair Trading is to seek a new code of practice for the sale of
extended warranties on electrical products.
A group of Labour party supporters in the City of London has set up a
limited company to raise at least Pounds 100,000 for political advertising
at the next British general election. Roger Warren Evans, a former executive
at Bovis and J. Sainsbury, said the company hoped to raise funds from
business people who were keen to see a change of government but were
unwilling to contribute directly to Labour.
Fears that UK interest rates may have to rise further were fuelled by signs
that recent rapid economic growth is creating new inflationary pressures.
MARKETS
UK equities hit their lowest levels since July on Monday. The FT-SE 100
index ended 33.9 lower at 2,943.4, making a fall of 2.3 per cent over the
preceding two sessions. The index then recovered to move back through 3,000
in spite of the collapse of merger discussions between SG Warburg and Morgan
Stanley (see Companies below).
Political developments weakened both the lira and the French franc during
the week. Worries about the Berlusconi government falling lay behind the
lira slipping to a record low against the D-Mark. Jacques Delors' decision
not to stand for the French presidency next year contributed to the franc
falling to a 12-month low against the D-Mark.
Erik Jarve, sacked president of the Oslo bourse, was found drowned in a
fjord south of the Norwegian capital only hours after his dismissal in
connection with alleged financial irregularities.
Copper prices on the London Metal Exchange on Thursday surged to their
highest levels for five and a quarter years.
COMPANIES
Trafalgar's proposed hostile bid for Northern Electric undermined received
financial wisdom that the regional electricity companies were safe from
hostile predators. Recs' share prices rose on the back of speculation that
other similar hostile bids could soon be made.
The government said it would retain its 'golden' shares in the recs until
March 31 1995. This makes it unlikely that conglomerate Trafalgar House
would be able to complete a potential takeover of Northern Electric before
that date.
John Roberts, chief executive of Manweb, said the electricity distributor
had no plans to merge with other regional companies.
Asda, Britain's fourth-biggest grocery retailer, outstripped profit
forecasts with a pre-tax increase of 47 per cent to Pounds 108.7m for the 28
weeks to November 12.
British Gas is to withdraw all consumer advice and complaints services from
its high street showrooms next month as part of the transformation of its
network into a purely retail operation. Cedric Brown, chief executive, who
was recently awarded a 75 per cent pay rise, has been called to give
evidence to an inquiry into executive salaries launched by the Commons
employment committee.
British Petroleum aims to boost profits by 50 per cent within two years and
cut its debt by about Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.8bn) without help from higher
oil prices. Chief executive David Simon unveiled the targets to analysts and
institutional shareholders.
A radical change in the ownership of Sabena, the Belgian national carrier,
is on the cards as Swissair, Switzerland's national airline, confirmed it is
in discussions with the Belgian government.
ASW Holdings, the Cardiff-based steel and construction products group, is to
swap its Scunthorpe rod mill business for British Steel's fully-diluted 35.2
per cent stake in ASW. The deal is part of a package that marks a further
rationalisation in the European steel industry and gives ASW its first steel
plants in continental Europe.
Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail and the Evening Standard,
has produced record revenues and trading profits despite the newspaper
price-cutting wars.
M&amp;G Group, the independent unit trust company that stresses the importance
of high dividends, lifted its total pay-out for the year by 20 per cent to
30p a share, matching the rise in earnings.
Morgan Stanley and SG Warburg called off talks aimed at creating a dominant
global investment bank because of resistance from Warburg's fund management
arm, Mercury Asset Management, to the merger proposals. The merger talks
broke down after the board of MAM, which is 75 per cent owned by Warburg,
demanded a premium offer for its minority shareholders as well as
operational independence from Morgan Stanley.
Murray Johnstone has announced plans to launch one of the new breed of
venture capital trusts, details of which were outlined in the last Budget.
The volume of beer sales at Greene King has risen for the first time in
three years. The group reported a 12 per cent rise in interim pre-tax
profits.
Euro Disney said that from April it would cut the entrance price to its
loss-making theme park outside Paris, adding that visitor numbers had risen
this year. Its shares rose on the Paris bourse.
The benefit of last year's flotation was seen in the fourfold increase in
profits at Allders, the department store and duty-free retail group floated
last year.
Maurice Saatchi's future as chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising
group he founded, hangs in the balance following an explosive row between
the company and leading shareholders over a proposed Pounds 5m option
package for Saatchi. A board meeting yesterday was due to decide his fate.
ICI is preparing to scrap the in-house manager for its Pounds 4.6bn pension
scheme and has asked leading investment fund managers to make presentations
to manage the funds externally.
Greenalls, the diverse group with pub, off-licence, hotel and drinks
distribution interests, has lifted annual pre-tax profits by 10 per cent,
helped by the first full-year contribution from the Devenish pub chain.
Union Miniere, the Belgian metals group, postponed the flotation of its
Swedish subsidiary, Ammeberg Mining, because it could not achieve the
hoped-for price.
Albright &amp; Wilson, one of the oldest names in UK chemicals, is returning to
the London stock market with a flotation aimed at raising at least Pounds
600m. The company lost its independence in 1978 when it was taken over by
Tenneco of the US.
Tiphook, the transport leasing group, announced it had reached a Dollars 12m
(Pounds 7.3m) settlement of a lawsuit being brought by some of the group's
US bondholders. The agreement will go before a US federal court within the
next two weeks for approval.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Managers who miscalculate - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial sophisticates tend to prefer investment trusts to unit trusts. One
reason is that it is far easier for a fund manager to run a fixed pool of
investments (as with an investment trust) than one which rises and falls
according to demand (as with a unit trust). A second reason is that the
financial structure of an investment trust can be far more complex than that
of a unit trust.
The argument is that these two characteristics help investment trust
managers to do a better job. If market conditions are turbulent, unit trust
managers are on a hiding to nothing: either they keep a large cash safety
margin or they risk being forced to dump their best holdings in a falling
market. Investment trust managers can concentrate on creating a portfolio
designed to enhance shareholder value over the long term.
They can also create complicated financial structures which alter the flows
of money through the trust to investors. Such structures can be used either
to back the managers' view of the market or to tailor different securities
to different investor objectives: for example, gearing up by borrowing money
in a bull market helps magnify the return to shareholders. Giving different
securities in the same trust different rights, as in split capital trusts,
allows one trust to appeal to both income investors and growth investors.
And yet, being human, even investment trust managers run into problems. For
the same reason they sometimes aggravate those problems by their attempts to
solve them.
Take British Assets Trust. Like many money managers, it has run into trouble
by pandering to its shareholders' unrealistic desire for income. Originally,
it set out to give them real (inflation-adjusted) dividend growth from an
international portfolio. In recent years, this has been hard to achieve
without harming capital growth prospects.
The cost to British Assets (and so to its shareholders) of this misplaced
indulgence was a double one: the managers altered the balance of the
investment portfolio in ways which boosted short-term yield at the expense
of longer term growth; and they paid short-earned dividends.
There is no good way out of this corner. The worry is that British Assets is
using financial engineering to push the problem into the future.
Shareholders have been given the choice of keeping their income at its
existing level or agreeing to a cut in income for the next seven years in
return for a larger share of both assets and income at the end of that
period.
It is a neat way for the managers to buy time in which to re-organise the
investment portfolio. But a stay of execution is not the same as a pardon.
At the end of the seven years, shareholders who have swapped income today
for more capital and income tomorrow will be knocking on the door. It is
conceivable that, in the interim, the investment portfolio will have been
re-organised so successfully that both sets of investors do well. But there
is no guarantee, and clever financial instruments have a nasty habit of
exploding in the faces of their inventors.
Problem number two is that only hindsight will tell if jam tomorrow was a
more profitable choice than jam today. Interestingly, different
stockbrokers' analysts recommended different choices. This is partly because
their valuations of the securities on offer differ. Fair enough. But if
professional analysts cannot agree on what is likely to happen, how could
any ordinary investor be expected to make an intelligent choice?
Many seem to have decided that, if they cannot use their heads, they will
vote with their feet. Since the re-organisation proposals were announced
late last month, BA's shares' discount to the underlying asset value has
widened from 6 to 11 per cent.
The message for fund managers is: think hard before you get out the Meccano
set. For investors: if any investment looks too good to be true, it probably
is.
Private investors buying gilts should normally buy them directly rather than
through a unit trust. For even though charges on gilt unit trusts are lower
than on most others, they still eat into your returns.
But some of the financial advisers offering to run portfolios of gilts for
private clients charge even more than unit trusts. Bristol-based Whitechurch
Securities, for instance, has an initial charge of 6 per cent and an annual
charge of 2 per cent on small gilt portfolios. That compares with an initial
charge of 4 per cent and running charge of 1 per cent or less from most gilt
unit trusts.
Even Whitechurch agrees that the only thing which could justify its charges
is sizzling outperformance.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Books: Human kind richly defined - Poetry / Douglas Dunn
reviews the latest crop of contemporary verse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOUGLAS DUNN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thirty-odd years ago - if you are old enough - did you ever think you would
read a poem by Allen Ginsberg, beginning 'as I cross my kitchen floor the
thought of Death returns'? I bet you didn't. Did you foretell that in his
penitent old age the arch-Beat would write an anti-smoking song? Or that he
would write poems in which he asked how he got himself into this mess, 'this
workaholic show-biz meditation market'? Is this what the Beats come to -
remorse and contrition? Lucky Kerouac, to have died before his talent and
success drove him to give up fags and booze. Ginsberg's recent poetry
(Cosmopolitan Greetings, Penguin, Pounds 7.99) subtracts from his prestige
as an icon of rhapsody and excess.
While a lot of contemporary poetry would benefit from even a few ounces of
Ginsberg's earlier fire and energy, that could not be said of Douglas
Oliver's Penniless Poetics (Bloodaxe Books, Pounds 7.95). For about 50 pages
Oliver drives on with a big, baggy stanza which is a handy instrument in a
poem of sustained narrative rollick and invention. What the poem says might
be a bit hard to take at times, which could be the same as saying that
living up to its brilliant first line - 'all politics the same crux: to
define human kind richly' - is too much a matter of the reader's conviction
and not the author's.
Oliver's poem is up-tempo and generously inventive, and much the same has to
be said for Iain Crichton Smith's poetry. His range includes almost
everything between footnotes and the 'marvellous spendthrift universe'. He
is not as sexily post-modernist, though, and much of his power stems from
short passages and even individual phrases. His poetry aspires to a timeless
lyricism:
'The moon shone like a round shield/ In a window between two countries/ Like
ice that has grown over unowned land.'
More than many poets, Smith seems to write straight from dreams, which might
be why his work carries a look of spontaneity. Ends &amp; Beginnings (Carcanet
Press, Pounds 8.95) shows a poet now in his 60s writing as if with a new
lease of life. It includes some of his best work.
A more exact, engraved rather than brushed poetry, confirms just what an
interesting poet Pauline Stainer is (The Ice-Pilot Speaks, Bloodaxe Books,
Pounds 6.95) - as well as setting up a contrast with the immediacy of
Ginsberg and Oliver, or Crichton Smith's less disciplined lyricism. Her best
gift is an artist's discretion in coaxing what she is saying onto the page
(see, for instance, 'Between Stations' and 'A Study for the Badminton
Game').
Today's version of the courtly in poetry is a self-aware reliance on art,
music and other literature, and there is a lot of that in her work. The
originality of her perceptions prevents its deliberately 'cultural' climate
from becoming precious.
Whatever Geoff Hattersley has to worry about, it is not preciosity. Some
poems in Don't Worry (Bloodaxe Books Pounds 7.95), though, give an
impression of slightness, cleverness, or embarrassment in case there is a
danger of being too serious. There is real gusto in his work as well as a
manic but controlled humour. He can evoke odd or unnerving states of mind,
enigmas, private terrors, domestic emergencies, with techniques or ways of
looking at things that seem devised to give the familiar a good shake. 'Time
passes slowly here in south Yorkshire. The dustbinmen came yesterday . . .
My cough gets on my nerves but at least I own it.' Cheeky, imaginative,
cerebral, witty - it is poetry with a lot to say for itself.
'Poet Laureate Ritual Bath Murder' in Douglas Houston's new book, The
Hunters in the Snow (Bloodaxe Books, Pounds 6.95), is as certain a piece of
literary satire as I have come across in a while - although the object of
the satire is how Ted Hughes is mythologised by his less intelligent
admirers. Houston's characteristic poems tend to be chunkier, more serious
and sorrowful although sharpened by quirky humour and observations. A deft
technical command, confident imagery - 'Night falling like a weightless slab
of slate' - and an agreeable first person singular, make this an enjoyable
collection. Less showily formal than others, 'Encounter' and 'Taking a
Break' suggest that simplicity is the most poetic wile of all.
Poems of Gerard Woodward's such as 'After the Deafening', 'A Nocturnal
Breakfast' and 'Tomatoes' jolt with an almost disturbing originality in
After the Deafening (Chatto &amp; Windus, Pounds 7.99). 'Making Strange' is a
process at once mysterious and recognisable. You feel that you have been
shown something new, or that the previously familiar really has been
re-examined with a fresh eye and intellect.
Not all his poems work anything like as well, but when they do the result
feels like a sting to the nervous system.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Books: Companions for the sporting life - Peter Berlin
reviews the sports books of the year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until very recently the majority of sports have been ill-served by
publishers. The exceptions were cricket and baseball, supposedly the more
meditative and intellectual sports. Books on these were permitted literary
ambitions. Thomas Boswell probably did not have his tongue entirely in his
cheek when he called a collection of baseball essays: 'How life imitates the
World Series.'
It was no accident that, for most of this century, the only outstanding
British sports refence book was Wisden, the cricket annual. Good books on
other sports were rare indeed.
That has begun to change. Sports publishing is still dominated by the
shallow biography or ghosted autobiography, although some are considerably
better than others. This year's better efforts include James Hunt - the
Biography by Gerald Donaldson (Collins Willow Pounds 15.99); and Clough -
the Autobiography by Brian Clough with John Sadler (Partridge Press, Pounds
16.99).
Alongside the usual torrent of froth, the silver trickle of books which
treat fans seriously is turning into a stream. These are books written by
fans, often about the experience of being a fan.
In Anyone But England, his assault on the English cricket establishment
(and, by extension, English society as a whole), Mike Marqusee recalls life
as a teenager in 1960s America. 'Swallowed up in a culture of mass protest
which rejected competitiveness and aggression, I lost interest in sport.' He
rediscovered sport at university in England, listening to Test Match Special
with stoned, giggling ex-public schoolboys and at Taunton, where he watched
Somerset play in the company of 'middle-aged men and women bundled in
tweeds' . . .and 'not a few long-haired remnants of an era that was rapidly
vanishing' - one of whom sold cannabis resin behind the scoreboard.
Marqusee, who unashamedly sees the hand of Marxist historical determinism in
Test results, is the middle-class rebel as sports fan.
Colin Ward's Steaming In, published in 1989, was reprinted in paperback this
year (Simon &amp; Schuster, Pounds 5.99). Ward is a different sort of rebel to
Marqusee. The book is a paean to the golden days of terrace-fighting in the
1970s. It is a catalogue of thuggery across the British Isles and the
continent of Europe.
For all its violence, the tale has a heroic quality. Ward followed a code of
honour. He disapproved of racism, thieving and weapons. He would not attack
people who had not indicated they were ready for a fight, or continue to
kick people once they were unconscious. In another time his tales of daring,
cunning raids on enemy strongholds and brave defence of home territory were
the stuff of manly young dreams. One of the hooligan leaders, Hickey, is
courageous, witty, generous and deeply racist. With a different accent and a
regimental tie, he could be the hero of a Buchan novel. Instead, he was
arrested in 1986 as part of Operation Own Goal and sentenced to 10 years in
prison.
Steaming In makes an excellent companion to Nick Hornby's more genteel and
literary Fever Pitch, about which quite enough has been written, and this
year's gloriously eccentric - and award winning - addition to the fan genre,
Football against the Enemy (Orion, Pounds 14.99) by Simon Kuper (now an FT
journalist).
Kuper spent nine months travelling the world, watching games and exploring
the link between soccer and politics. Everywhere he went people told him:
'you've come to the right place'. In every country, Kuper found fans,
footballers and administrators with tales to tell and theories to expound.
Perhaps the star is Roman Obchenko, head of international relations at
Dynamo Kiev, who explained that the club exports not just footballers but
nuclear missile parts. Kuper does not need to hammer his point home. In the
old USSR fans went to games to whistle. Soccer matches were the only place
they could show political dissent.
The lightness and economy of the account of a trip to a Celtic-Rangers match
in Glasgow with which Kuper ends his book contrasts favourably with the
self-conscious, stodgy and embarrassingly partisan meditation on the Old
Firm rivalry with which Don Watson opens Dancing in the Streets (Gollancz
Pounds 9.99). This is the tale of Watson's adventures in 'World Cup City'.
It starts in a pub on the Edgware Road, where Watson watches Ireland qualify
for the 1994 World Cup on television and ends in Pasadena, dancing in the
streets with triumphant Brazilian fans. Ostensibly, Watson set off to follow
Ireland. It is is difficult to avoid the suspicion that he was really
following the footsteps of Pete Davies, whose All Played Out, a fan's eye
view of England's 1990 World Cup campaign was, and is, a best seller.
There are other worthwhile works of a more conventional nature: Mihir Bose's
Sporting Colours (Robson Books), on sport in South Africa, Simon Wilde's
Letting Rip (Witherby Cassell) about fast bowlers, and Boswell's baseball
book, Cracking the Show (Pounds 19.99).
But the best-thumbed books in any sports fan's library are reference works.
These too are improving. Wisden remains a perennial best-seller, as does
Rothman's Football Yearbook (Headline, Pounds 16.99), which celebrated its
25th anniversary this year. But while Wisden remains unchallenged, Rothman's
now has a rival, The Endsleigh Football Club Directory (Harmsworth Active,
Pounds 14.95). This lacks Rothman's polished presentation and historical
scope, but does offer even more thorough player and club statistics.
Soccer, with its large fan base, dominates the field. The outstanding recent
reference books are works of eccentrics, obsessives - true soccer fans.
Three of the best, Guy Oliver's masterful World Soccer (Guiness, Pounds
19.95, 1992) and Simon Inglis' engrossing Football Grounds of Great Britain
(Willow, 1987, Pounds 11.99) and Football Grounds of Europe (Willow, 1990,
Pounds 14.95) are being updated.
A pleasing addition to the soccer library this year has been David
Pickering's Cassell Soccer Companion (Pounds 16.99) a quirky mix of strange
soccer facts and train-spotterish listings of non-league clubs.
Beyond soccer there is the Radio 5 Sports Yearbook 1995 (Oddball, Pounds
11.99), the latest incarnation of the invaluable annual that started as The
Sportspages Almanac, and gives a well-judged mix of statistics for almost
every sport. It makes an utterly reliable Christmas gift.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Books: JFK - the man behind the myth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT KENNEDY: A PROFILE OF POWER by Richard Reeves Macmillan Pounds
12.99, 800 pages
Washington, DC, January 26, 1961, early morning; snow swirling from high
winds, 12 degrees of frost, the worst inaugural weather in 52 years; John
Fitzgerald Kennedy, president-elect, sits down to breakfast. Richard Reeves
describes the scene: ''Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what
you can do for your country,' said John F. Kennedy. Then he paused, took
another bite of bacon, and reached for his coffee.' A surprisingly banal
account, perhaps, of a particularly propitious moment in the life of a
professional politician, but one that captures the distinctive tone and
ambition of Reeves' biography.
It is a long and very detailed book (we are even told, for example, that the
pope, in honour of inauguration day, had given Roman Catholics in the
Washington area 'a special dispensation from the Church's stricture against
eating meat on Fridays' and that Kennedy had consumed no fewer than three
rashers of bacon that morning), and it devotes most of its narrative to the
account of what Kennedy did at significant points during his three years in
power. Reeves is not so much interested in the myth as in the man, and not
so much in the fixed historical facts as in the feel that they must have had
as they took shape at the time.
What Reeves attempts is nothing less than a reconstitution of an historical
present. In stark contrast to the countless studies, ranging from the
reverential to the sharply revisionist, which have sought to place the
Kennedy presidency in a definitive interpretive resting-place, Reeves'
approach strives to re-animate the political context of the time, to
unsettle the confident images formed by hindsight.
The Kennedy of Reeves' narrative is a man who did not know what he was doing
at the beginning, and in some ways never changed at all, 'reacting to events
he often neither foresaw nor understood,' a man who was 'intelligent and
detached' but also 'careless and dangerously disorganised.' Comparisons with
more recent US political figures, although not attempted in the text, are
certainly not discouraged.
What emerges from Reeves' account as Kennedy's most striking quality is his
imaginative grace, his readiness to believe, unreservedly, in certain ideas
and images about himself and his political potential. The presidency,
observes Reeves, 'is an act of faith;' Kennedy, he argues, 'believed (and
proved) that the only qualification for the most powerful job in the world
was wanting it.'
It is this adamantine characteristic that becomes something of a leitmotif
in Reeve's narrative: the man who suffered from Addison's disease; who
sometimes needed crutches or a cane in private to rest his back; who needed
medication every day, sometimes every hour; who had received the last rites
at least four times before he was elected president; yet who still preserved
a public image as a beacon of youthful hope. 'He had little ideology,'
claims Reeves. 'And he had less emotion. What he had was an attitude.'
Reeves is most effective as a biographer considering Kennedy's personal and
political attributes. He is less convincing (sometimes disturbingly so) as
an historian. His coverage of Kennedy's relations with the Soviet Union
seems distinctly uneven, and his account of the Cuban missile crisis is
incomplete and, in places, rather misleading. For someone who purports to be
committed to the discovery of what Kennedy knew 'and when he knew it and
what he actually did - sometimes day by day, sometimes hour by hour,
sometimes minute by minute,' he is also capable of making some curiously
injudicious remarks. When, for example, Reeves discusses the growing
tensions in black America, it is unlikely that he intends to be taken
literally when he asserts that 'President Kennedy found out there was a
revolution in his country by reading The New York Times on May 15, 1961,'
but neither is it very clear why he felt the need to employ such a
misleading turn of phrase.
As a serious work of history, therefore, President Kennedy is, in spite of
its apparent attention to detail, disappointingly lightweight and
unreliable. As a popular biographical study of a president in power,
however, it is well-written and refreshingly imaginative and vivid in its
efforts at rendering a little more real those events too often obscured by
myth.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Books: A brazen pot among earthen vessels - Vernon Bogdanor
argues that the great Lord Curzon was a bully who was rightfully denied the
premiereship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
CURZON by David Gilmour John Murray Pounds 25, 601 pages
Enoch Powell once declared that the lives of all politicians, unless cut
short in mid-career, end in failure. No 20th century life illustrates this
dictum better than that of George Nathaniel, 1st Marquess of Curzon. Viceroy
of India in 1898 before he was 40, Curzon left an indelible mark on that
sub-continent. 'You will never send to India', declared John Morley, 'and
you have never sent to India, a viceroy his superior'.
After a period in the wilderness, Curzon returned to office in 1915, to
became foreign secretary from 1919 to 1924, under Lloyd George, Bonar Law
and Baldwin. His achievements in the foreign office were, if anything, even
greater than in India. It was Curzon who achieved a peace treaty with the
Turks at Lausanne in 1923, Curzon who helped ease France out of the Ruhr in
1923, Curzon who began the revision of reparations that culminated in the
Dawes Plan, Curzon who resolved the Corfu crisis without either alienating
Mussolini or weakening the League of Nations. He remains among the greatest
of 20th century foreign secretaries.
And yet, it all turned to ashes. As number two to the ailing Bonar Law,
Curzon had every expectation of the premiership. He was, John Simon had
declared, 'the brazen pot' among 'the earthen vessels' of the Tories.
Yet, within sight of the finishing post, the prize was snatched from him by
someone he regarded as 'a person of the utmost insignificance', Stanley
Baldwin. The story is well known how, lacking such modern appurtenances as a
telephone, Curzon waited in his house at Montacute until the village post
office received a telegram from the King's private secretary asking if
Curzon would receive him in London. Returning to Carlton House Terrace, he
was told that the King had already appointed Baldwin since, with the Labour
opposition unrepresented in the Lords, it was essential that the prime
minister sit in the Commons. 'Such was the manner in which it was intimated
to me that the cup of honourable ambition had been dashed from my lips and
that I could never aspire to fill the highest office in the service of the
Crown'.
The dramatic career of this Imperial proconsul has already inspired a number
of biographies. The official biography, published in 1928, three years after
Curzon's death, was written by the Earl of Ronaldshay, a future Secretary of
State for India under Baldwin and Chamberlain. In 1934, Harold Nicolson
published a study of his diplomacy, Curzon: The Last Phase. In 1960, Leonard
Mosley was employed by Beaverbrook to do a hatchet job, while in 1969 two
further biographies appeared, a life by Kenneth Rose and two volumes by
David Dilks, Curzon in India, on the viceroyalty.
Given this plethora of biographical material, it is not clear why a further
volume should be needed. Although Curzon is David Gilmour's first book on
British history, he proves himself a master of his subject. He is a
formidable researcher, having consulted no less than 77 collections of
private papers. His judgment is generally sound and his style clear. There
are one or two nuggets of fresh material, especially on the 1916 ministerial
crisis which made Lloyd George prime minister and the Chanak crisis of 1922
which destroyed him. Yet he does not really have enough that is new to say
to justify a 600 page book. Perhaps what Curzon really needs is not another
biography but a short interpretative essay of the kind that Roy Jenkins does
so well.
Gilmour's book, like most biographies, presents the case for the defence,
claiming that Curzon was a more sensitive person and more riddled with
self-doubt than he appeared. He argues that many of the more outrageous
utterances attributed to Curzon were either apocryphal or self-mocking. Did
he ever say, upon seeing soldiers bathing, 'Dear me, I had no conception the
lower classes had such white skins'? Did he really hail a bus and direct it
to Downing Street, feigning surprise when it did not go there?
In the last resort, for all his achievements, it cannot be denied that there
was something utterly preposterous about the ex-Viceroy. In public, he
appeared pompous, dictatorial and conceited. A bully to his inferiors, he
cringed before Lloyd George and failed to defend the prerogatives of the
foreign office against the prime minister's 'Garden Suburb'. The man who had
declared in 1902 that an increase in soldiers' pay would merely 'find its
early correlative in increased syphilis and intoxication', would hardly have
proved a suitable premier during the labour unrest of the 1920s. In
rejecting him for the premiership in 1923, George V made his own not
insignificant contribution to foiling the British revolution.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Motoring: Chancellor should come clean - Stuart Marshall
complains that Kenneth Clarke has ignored the evidence on diesel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The anti-diesel car lobby still has the ear of Britain's chancellor of the
exchequer, Kenneth Clarke. That much is obvious from his latest Budget,
which took away the tiny differential in excise duty which, until nearly
three weeks ago, had favoured diesel marginally over unleaded petrol.
Now, the duty rates are the same. For every litre of unleaded or diesel
bought by motorists at an average pump price of 54 pence, 30.44p goes into
the chancellor's pot.
Britain is Europe's odd man out. Everywhere else, diesel is cheaper than
unleaded petrol - sometimes spectacularly so. Why?
In his Budget speech, Clarke said a differential between petrol and diesel
'is clearly becoming very difficult to justify in economic, health or in
environmental terms'. Clearly to whom?
Obviously, to his advisers, who strike me as perverse and contradictory. But
not at all clearly to expert opinion in the motor industry - including
independent (and thus unbiased) sources like Ricardo Consultants, a British
automotive think-tank of world renown.
Diesel cars produce much less carbon dioxide than petrol vehicles because
they burn less fuel - and not just carbon dioxide. A study Ricardo carried
out recently for Mercedes-Benz revealed that a car diesel engine without a
catalyser produced fewer air toxics (harmful emissions) than a petrol engine
with an elaborate catalyser.
Add a simple kind of catalyser - which many diesel cars now have - and the
emissions were twice as clean as those from a catalyser-equipped petrol
engine.
There is a lot more where this came from. Petrol cars with the most
elaborate catalysers emit vastly more benzine - a known carcinogen - than a
non-catalysed diesel, the fuel of which is almost benzine-free.
In urban driving conditions, diesels reduce fuel consumption (to which
carbon dioxide emissions are linked directly) by up to 40 per cent. And
although research into cleaning the emissions from diesel engines began far
later than it did for petrol power plants, much has been achieved and
further large gains are in prospect.
With diesels, the one fly in the ointment is the emission of particulates -
that is, smoke. But petrol cars also can emit up to 0.02gm of particulates a
kilometre - 'not much less than can be achieved with advanced prototype
diesel engines', says Ricardo.
Cheaper fuel, though, is only the icing on the cake for diesels. They use so
much less of it that they still make economic sense, especially for
high-mileage drivers and those who do a lot of stop-go driving in traffic.
My present car, a Citroen Xantia turbo-diesel manual, averages 39.8mpg (7.09
l/100km). A Citroen XM turbo-diesel automatic gave me 34.05mpg (8.29
l/100km), and a Mercedes-Benz 190D 2.5 automatic produced 36.14mpg (7.82
l/100km).
These are realistic figures over several years' motoring, with plenty of the
short trips and cold starts that ruin a petrol car's economy. On motorways,
I keep up with the pack.
In spite of the government's anti-diesel car stance, their market share has
grown steadily and they account for around 22 per cent of all British
registrations. I cannot see this changing. The dearer fuel becomes - and we
all know that excise duty can only go up - the greater the diesel car's
appeal.
Pump prices of diesel vary more than those of unleaded. Within 20 miles of
my home in Kent, I have seen 7p a litre difference at diesel pumps on the
same day. And do not pass a supermarket filling station if your tank is
half-empty. They are usually so much cheaper that they can even be worth a
detour.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Sport: A glimpse of the future - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first half of the rugby season has given us a taste of how the game will
work once it becomes a non-stop year-round international sport. Over the
past 10 weeks, the Springboks have been in Wales, Scotland and Ireland and
Romania and Canada at Twickenham. The international games followed each
other rapidly.
After next year's Rugby World Cup in South Africa only three countries will
definitely pre-qualify for the 1999 finals - the two finalists and the
winner of the third place play off (a fourth may also pre-qualify if the
host is not one of the first three nations).
England may well pre-qualify as hosts but there is a good chance that
Scotland, Wales, Ireland and France will have to pre-qualify. The increase
in matches will stretch the international rugby calendar throughout a full
season.
One immediate result of this autumn's proliferation of internationals was to
marginalise non-international matches, namely the Varsity Match.
The internationals provided some pointers to world cup form. The Springboks
are nearly a great side. Against Scotland they were magisterial. They were
more fortunate the following week against a fighting Welsh side who have
found their pride and commitment again.
The Welsh had only one game plan and it did not involve using their
three-quarters. Instead Neil Jenkins, at fly half, kept the ball in front of
his forwards in the hope that the Springboks would give away penalties. It
nearly worked.
At least, in Derwyn Jones, the 6ft 10in lock, Wales now know they can win
line-out ball at will. It will be interesting to see if Alan Davies, the
Welsh coach, changes his one dimensional tactics for the forthcoming Five
Nations Championship.
For the South Africans, the Barbarian fixture in Dublin, was one game too
many. They graciously made five changes to their test team to give all their
squad the chance to play and thus revealed that they do not yet have a squad
that will win the world cup.
Few would disagree that in three of the five critical positions - at
full-back hooker and No 8 - they have, the best players in the world: Andre
Joubert, Ulrich Schmidt and Rudulf Straeuli. But at both half back positions
the jury is out. True, Joost van der Westhuizen, the scrum half, ducked and
dived to great effect against Scotland but his passing from the base of the
scrum was woeful and this meant that his fly half, Hendrik Le Roux, was
rarely ever able to impose his personality on his side's tactics.
Almost by error, the South Africans found a game plan based on their
emerging back row of Francois Pienaar (an inspirational captain and a public
relations dream), Ruben Kruger (the best player on tour) and Straeuli. By
their athleticism and presence this trio took games, shook them hard and
seized the initiative time and time again.
The Springboks looked tired alter the Welsh game. The time has come to move
the Barbarians game and follow the example of cricket. Cricket tours start
with a soft opener against the Duchess of Norfolk's XI at Arundel. Visiting
rugby teams should start with the Barbarian fixture and the gate should go
to charity.
England easily, if somewhat clumsily, defeated a poor Romania XV and then
last week turned the screw against a battling Canadian side. The team is
beginning to settle - Simon Shaw, the uncapped Bristol lock, needs a few
games in the Five Nations' championships to bed him down ready for the World
Cup; Ian Hunter needs to be rehabilitated on the right wing and Mike Catt
will one day prove a brilliant deputy for Rob Andrew.
In the 1991 Rugby World Cup side, England finally decided that what mattered
most on the right wing was that the player would give no tries away and be
safe under the high ball. They chose a centre, Simon Halliday to play on the
wing. The same thought must be occupying Jack Rowell, the current England
coach.
He knows that Tony Underwood, who played on the right against Canada, is not
up to international rugby but he is unsure - rare for him - of the solution.
I suspect Philip de Glanville and Mike Catt will be tried out at some time
over the next few months.
England have developed an ability to raise their game for big matches. Their
15-a-side approach is how the game is played in New Zealand and Australia
and one effect is that the scorelines are much higher. Running rugby
involves a greater risk but is much more fun to play and to watch.
The Varsity Match was a classic. Cambridge emerged from the tunnel on to the
Twickenham turf slowly and deliberately reminiscent of the Scots under David
Sole four years ago at Murrayfield when the foe was England and a Grand Slam
was at stake. Cambridge played a wonderful game and deserved their win.
Naturally, it hurt, being an Oxford Blue, to see Oxford lose. At one time in
the second half they looked as though they were going to concede 40 points
but rallied and nearly won the match.
Cambridge used a tactic I had not seen before. At the maul, their forwards
did not pile in blindly hoping that somehow sheer strength would see them
through. They kept popping the ball up to the next player coming in. As a
consequence they ripped the Oxford defence to shreds. It was compelling to
watch.
Cambridge showed the northern hemisphere countries, who are fed up with
arguing the rights and wrongs of the turn-over law, a way to use it more
constructively.
The up-coming Five Nations Championship should have been moved to April so
the participants could have used it as the final stage of their build up. As
it is, the championships serve only to interrupt their preparations.
Scotland, unless they can drop Gavin Hastings, do not have a hope and will
win the wooden spoon. Ireland and Wales still have to demonstrate that they
understand the word variety. England and France again look as though they
will fight it out. England have so often been the favourites these past six
years, but have won only twice. The probability is that France will emerge
as the Five Nations Cup holders for 1995.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Motoring: Small, roomy and smooth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new Volkswagen Polo 1.3 CL (pictured) was so refined, roomy and
smooth-riding that it came as a surprise to turn round in my seat and see
how small it really was - and to discover how easily it could be reversed up
my awkwardly curving drive.
Head room generous - there is no standard sun-roof to get in the way. Clutch
and five-speed gearbox are up to the best Japanese standards of silkiness,
and the 1.3-litre engine is eager to spin sweetly or pull hard at low
revolutions.
In town, the Polo CL's compactness, power steering and good visibility make
parking easy. At motorway speeds, it did not sound unduly busy and, on
winding roads, its handling was a delight. Reckon on averaging 43mpg (6.6
l/100km), or better than 400 miles (645km) a tankful.
VW's prices are much keener than they were. The 1.3 CL three-door, with
driver's air-bag and electric windows, costs a modest Pounds 8,700. Prices
start at Pounds 6,950 for the one-litre Polo L, on which power steering is
Pounds 400 extra, and go up to Pounds 11,750 for the five-door GLX 1.6 with
ABS brakes, alloy wheels and manual sunroof.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Gardening: Green and pleasant gifts - Robin Lane Fox solves
present problems for the whole family with a trip to the nearest garden
centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If in doubt, give a gardener a gadget. If in funds, give yourself four of
the five new types of Christmas tree which have pushed prices up to Pounds 5
a foot.
If you are canny, however, you will know already that conventional Christmas
trees sell for Pounds 1.50 a foot deep in the country and that the prices
usually drop before the needles on Christmas Eve.
Personally, I would prefer to be given a plant. As presents, plants seem to
be socially unacceptable unless they are overheated house-plants which will
die by the end of January. Like dogs, hardy plants are not just for
Christmas. Unlike dogs, they improve the garden and can be left inside until
the weather improves.
Thanks to the better garden centres, plants look tempting in their close
season. Like good supermarkets, they show plants which look fresh and
worm-free and tempt customers who never go near open country. As a result,
you can now give them as presents without leaving earth on the carpet or
being unacceptably rustic.
This year, amazingly, you can even give hardy plants in flower. I have had a
fascinating time hunting through the centres and their main suppliers,
looking for hardy flowerers which are six months out of season.
Here are my top six, aimed at solving common family present problems and
priced from big suburban centres.
For Nigels and Tanias, who garden in shade in London and spend the summers
south of Florence, this year's answer is a camellia. Plants of the hardy
varieties are already flowering and I would opt for the double white 'Swan
Lake' which looks heavenly in a two-litre pot, even at Pounds 14.95.
For aunts and uncles on light soils in south-east England, I would
capitalise on the mild weather and choose the craziest sight of the year:
medium-sized plants of Ceanothus 'Gloire de Versailles', which have been
standing outdoors and flowering freely, four months after their season, at a
price of only Pounds 8.95.
Remind the Bernards and Catherines that these plants are hardy in most
winters, but not all, and that they might be better in a well-lit shed until
spring. They look lovely as a foil to old-fashioned roses if you prune them
gently in April to keep them at a height of about 5ft.
For Gill and Max, who have just settled in their home for life, choose a
long-term winter shrub and look no further than the witch hazels which
prefer neutral or acid soil and will improve with age. They, too, have been
flowering frantically to attract givers and, for Pounds 19.95, you can lose
your head with a full-flowering Hamamelis 'Pallida', whose pale yellow
flowers are the prettiest of the usual varieties.
Evergreens are their natural companions and need less of an explanation when
non-gardeners unwrap them - anyone can appreciate a good leaf. Some of the
bigger centres are stocking the cream-variegated form of Rhamnus, a great
favourite of mine against a south or west wall.
For Valerie and David, who open their gardens to the public, the best buys
on the circuit are fresh plants of the evergreen Osmanthus heterophyllus
'Variegatus', at Pounds 8.95. Garden centres can still surprise us all among
the usual range of mallows and buddleias: I have grown a plant of this
osmanthus with its mildly prickly evergreen leaves for the past 20 years. It
has moved homes with me, but it is still only 3ft high and wide. It is very
chic and striking and it has just flowered suddenly for the first time in
the mild November.
While planting out the forget-me-nots, I became aware of an exquisite scent
which traced back to the lines of tiny white flowers hanging from its
branches. It is the thinking person's alternative to yet more squares of
clipped green box.
I could never resist a viburnum, especially if I could not remember whether
Aunt Judith's soil in Wiltshire was acid or not. The winter varieties are
predictably good this week, but you can also find flowers on the
spring-flowering carlesii this week or on the bigger and stronger 'Park Farm
Hybrid'.
When there are still flowers all over the place I have less time for those
centres which are trying to sell callicarpas with violet-mauve fruits by
calling them 'Beauty Berries' and pricing them at Pounds 24.95 each. The
small print tells you that you need a group of three in order to be sure of
a proper crop.
Instead, I would go for a yellow-berried cotoneaster which is excellent up
any great-uncle Edward's drainpipe, even in semi-shade. 'Expery' or
'Rothschild' are the best varieties. You can still find plants with yellow
berries untouched at 'only' Pounds 8.95.
What about those difficult people, young couples who have nothing but
principles and mean, for the moment, to stay together for years, or
open-handed people who have so much more money than you and may well try to
humiliate you by dishing out a crate of champagne?
Outflank the young Simons and Kirstys by giving them the nucleus of their
fruitcage for the future. This year, the blackcurrant bushes are looking
eminently unwrappable because they are thick with buds, though still without
leaves.
'Baldwin' is a sound, later-cropping variety which will be at its best when
the superstores have moved on through the calendar and are trying to sell
you loganberries instead.
The champagne Charlies need more generous treatment. Do not be stampeded
into buying the neatly-clipped standard of evergreen privet or bay at Pounds
70 because it looks fancy: you could grow one yourself for very much less
and they look better in pairs, increasing the bill. Instead, go for
unarguable quality which even the idlest garden-watcher will know how to
pronounce.
This week, there are super magnolias, looking large, clean and advanced in
bud. Big bushes of Magnolia alba superba range from Pounds 14.95 to Pounds
49 for extravagant specimens, 4ft high and wide. The rustica rubra form of
this variety can be found at even greater sizes, up to Pounds 70. My
personal choice would have to be Magnolia loebneri 'Leonard Messel',
root-wrapped in hessian and about 4ft high at a cool Pounds 69, complete
with dozens of visible buds.
These large magnolias will transplant easily into gardens so long as you
water them over a dry spring and early summer. After five years, smaller
sensible transplants will probably have overtaken them, but Christmas is not
a time for being sensible.
If you are wondering how to measure up to a millionaire's fire-power, enlist
a magnolia's flower-power and be fairly sure that she will not know what it
really costs.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Outdoors: As Swiss as edelweiss - FT Ski Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. They are currently in New Mexico.
When we pulled back the curtains of our luxurious apartment at the Chalet
Montesano, we were greeted with a picture-postcard Alpine scene. As the
snowflakes cascaded among the fir trees, a large Swiss flag fluttered gently
from the wooden balcony.
In a country which loves to imitate Europe, it doesn't get much more Swiss
than Taos Ski Valley, New Mexico - small village, big skiing. Taos was,
after all, invented by Ernie Blake, a German-born Swiss, and Swiss themes
dominate the resort.
Two of the principal hotels are the St Bernard and the Edelweiss. There is a
Kandahar Lodge and Swiss flags abound.
The Chalet Montesano is owned by Victor Froehlich, a ski instructor and
pastry chef from Davos and once a Swiss junior international goalkeeper. It
is named after the chalet in Gstaad where his wife Karin went to finishing
school. There is even a sign saying: 'Achtung - Private Parking.'
Lew Wallace, governor of New Mexico between 1878 and 1881 and author of
Ben-Hur, complained that 'every calculation based on experience elsewhere
fails in New Mexico'. Not as cruel, perhaps, as: 'Poor old New Mexico - so
far from heaven, and so close to Texas.'
Many skiers these days like to think Taos is heaven. Several runs cut
through steep and picturesque glades reflecting the Swiss/German connection:
Edelweiss Glade, Tell Glade, Winkelried, St Bernard and even Sir Arnold
Lunn.
And there are other, more dramatic Teutonic connections. Blake worked for
Allied Intelligence during the second world war, and grilled one or two big
fish such as Goering. To honour some of those who tried to rid the world of
Hitler, he named the best runs in Taos after them. Hence Tresckow, Fabian,
Oster and Staufenberg. Churchill is not forgotten, either. Both Winston and
Spencer's Glade are tough, expert runs.
We thought we should stick to Taos's legendary tough runs, because we were
being watched. The whole resort knew we were there because Chris Stagg, vice
president of marketing and Blake's son-in-law, had put our names on the
day's lift ticket. All 500 of the skiers in Taos that day had 'Welcome Arnie
and Lucy, Ski The World' written on their lift tickets. (Five hundred is not
bad for early December in Taos.)
Froehlich, who was one of the original instructors, said that when Blake
started the ski area in 1955, you could squeeze the entire ski school and
its clients round one table for dinner at the old Hondo Lodge.
Much of the grooming was done by hand, with shovels. 'There were only two
radios in those days,' he said. 'Ernie had one and the ski patrol had the
other.'
Sometimes Blake told the then teenage Karin Froehlich to 'go groom
Porcupine'.
Karin, just about the only woman in the resort in the early days, continued
to make an impression on her boss by living in a freezing old trailer which
she called the 'ice box', and, determined to be independent, refused to eat
the hot meals Blake organised for his staff.
Said Victor: 'I thought this would be a good woman to get to know better.'

FT  17 DEC 94 / Outdoors: Fat skis send you flying - Arnie Wilson on how a
new type of ski allows almost anyone to go heli-skiing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Painting by numbers may not have produced many Rembrandts but it gives
pleasure to many would-be artists who might otherwise have difficulty
painting a shed.
And Bach might be turning in his grave at modern keyboards that play
themselves, but they bring the excitement of making music to uninitiated.
And now we have 'fat boys', which allow mediocre skiers to join the hitherto
elite and become heli-skiers - skiers who ride like Vietnam 'grunts' to
virgin snow in a clattering helicopter, there to ski in bottomless powder
where few have skied before.
So how, in the time it takes to don a powder suit in a telephone box, can
Average Skier become Super Skier?
Fat skis are the answer. They have sparked the off-piste revolution and this
winter, have taken a grip on heli-skiing.
The 'fat' ski was developed by ski manufacturer Atomic, based on a prototype
designed by a former Austrian train driver who had the idea of sawing a
snowboard in half. The original, the Atomic Powder Plus, was quickly
imitated by virtually all the main ski manufacturers.
The usual length is either 165cms or 185cms and because the ski is almost
twice as wide as a conventional ski it floats on the surface of powder
rather than burrowing deeply into it. They can bought or rented in most main
ski areas, but not in huge numbers as they are only really designed for
off-piste use.
So today, middle-aged intermediates who would have had a terrible struggle
to ski powder can now sign up for a week's helicopter skiing knowing that
the fat skis will be their passport to success. The only barrier to
heli-skiing now is cash, not skill.
But the question remains: is it right and proper that the rank and file
should be allowed to use this new equipment to penetrate the mystique of the
true artist or athlete?
Inevitably, those with a passion for the real thing might resent 'skills'
acquired so cheaply. Those skilful enough to heli-ski on ordinary skis tend
to resent the fact that their precious world - not to mention their sacred
powder - is being invaded by lesser beings.
Helicopter skiing is frowned upon in many parts of Europe, where
environmentalists have successfully managed to have it banned in most of
Austria and France. This leaves Switzerland as Europe's heli-skiing mecca,
with Italy another option.
The French get round the ban by transporting clients across the border into
Italy, where heli-skiing is permitted, and flying them to peaks from which
they can ski either in Italy or back into France. Helicopters are allowed to
collect skiers on French terrain at the end of the day from the bottom of
the mountain but not to take them to the top.
Grindelwald offers some of the best heli-skiing in the world, with huge
7,000ft vertical descents from such spots as Sustenalp and Rosenegg just
across the Eiger/Munch/Jungfrau massif.
There is good heli-skiing in New Zealand, the Himalayas and parts of what
was the Soviet Union, but North America - especially Canada - with its vast
wilderness areas, is where the sport of heli-skiing has become a
fully-fledged industry.
Resorts such as Sun Valley, Jackson Hole, Telluride, Whistler and Panorama
offer daily heli-ski outings, but if you want the 'total experience' you
should look at the option of spending a whole week in a heli-skiing lodge in
British Columbia where you live, breathe and dream helicopter skiing. It is
not cheap, but it is undoubtedly the best.
Canadian Mountain Holidays (CMH) runs lodges in nine areas, including the
celebrated Bugaboos, Cariboos, and Monashees.
If you are reluctant to be 'incarcerated' - however cosily and luxuriously -
in a wilderness lodge for a week, you have the option of basing yourself in
town: CMH offers excellent heli-skiing out of Revelstoke.
Its only serious rival is Mike Wiegele, whose operation is based in just one
location at Blue River but covers an enormous amount of terrain. While CMH
is the brand leader, both organisations are extremely professional and the
overall experience is similar. Fat skis now dominate Canadian heli-skiing.
Even most of the guides use them.
Skilled powder skiers determined not to pander to such toys can use
conventional skis, but the fat skis make it so much easier and less
energetic that they can find themselves being left behind by the fat
brigade.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Outdoors: Europe's fishing fleets prepare for war - Fish
supplies are running out, but the authorities seem powerless to act
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sea has always been a place of high feelings. It is becoming more so as
fishing nations worldwide try to extend, or consolidate, their fishing
zones. Nowhere are the issues as complex, fraught and politicised as in the
EU waters, under pressure from excess fish-catching capacity, lower stocks,
and the conflicting ambitions of member states, particularly Spain as well
as non-member Norway.
Protectionism has never been more old-fashioned than when Spanish tuna
fishermen defending their traditional, long-line fishery in the Bay of
Biscay brandished axes at the British arrivistes using deadlier modern
drift-nets.
Britain sent its own fishery protection service which proceeded to board and
inspect British, not Spanish, vessels.
The tuna furore took place outside the EU 200-mile fisheries zone, on the
high seas. Here the international law of the sea holds sway, theoretically
concerned only with piracy, slave-trading and the movement of illegal
narcotics.
Flag states may board their own nation's vessels anywhere. But in practice,
within the EU fisheries zone, each member state's fishery protection force
operates only in national waters. Spanish inspectors could, in theory,
appear off Scottish coasts to monitor Spanish fishermen but in practice they
do not. It is believed by other states' fishermen that Spanish inspectors
rarely police Spanish vessel.
Policing EU waters state by state, with fishery protection forces from
different maritime cultures, with differing motivations and muscle, is a
disaster. Each nation's fishermen accuses its own fishery officers of being
tougher than in other member states. British fishermen feel they are singled
out by their own inspectors for specially rigorous treatment, a claim denied
by protection officers themselves. Even so, the simplicity of dealing with
own-nation boats, UK registered, with UK addresses, is much more appealing
than dealing with foreign boats whose crews may not speak any English.
Even in British territorial waters, where England and Wales can call on nine
Royal Navy vessels and three aircraft, and Scotland on seven boats and two
aircraft, fishery protection is only a partial affair. 'We cannot search
every bit of the sea, but the fishermen know there is a presence out there,'
a ministry spokesman said. Britain has 33,000 sq miles of water to police,
but whereas the inspectorate has 170 employees, Spain, with the largest EU
fleet, had, until a recent increase, only 17 personnel.
Not only are national inspectorates a poor example of subsidiarity in
action, but the system is riddled with loopholes. For political reasons a
proposal from the European Commission to land catches in specified local
ports, where they could be more readily inspected, was turned down by the
council of ministers. Catches by EU vessels are routinely transferred at sea
into the holds of non-EU boats - thereby evading inspection and recording.
The most obvious example of catches leaving the European fish-pond without
proper recording is the klondykers. These factory ships are usually Polish
or Russian owned. They are often in poor physical condition. They lie off
Lerwick, Peterhead, Fraserburgh and Ullapool, lit up at night like gently
rocking cities, buying herring and mackerel and paying in cash.
The Common Fisheries Policy, formed in 1972 just before Britain joined the
EC, and which only produced its first conservation measures in 1983, is
abused on a giant scale. The 'black fish' catch is thought to have reached
50 per cent of the legitimate one and it has been estimated by a former head
of EC fisheries conservation that of the 2.5m fishing trips made annually in
EU waters, about 250,000 involve infringements. These include catching fish
surplus to quota, fish for which the boats have no quota, undersized fish
(pin hake 'as small as a Biro' were recently landed in northern Spain), or
fish from waters with exhausted quotas.
Such excesses need some explanation. There is one. It is simply that EU
member states have knowingly shrunk from implementing the recommended
conservation measures because of their political implications. There is
still public sympathy for fishermen, seen as hardy and independent souls
whose efforts play a critical part in the national diet. Such sympathy may
be misplaced. Scientists say catches that are now dwindling would have been
on the increase had their recommendations been accepted.
One of the most sensitive issues is the concept of a pan-European fishery
inspectorate. Nominally this exists in the form of an inspectorate of the
inspectors. This small force evaluates enforcement; it is advisory; it
handles complaints. But it lacks any vessels and its members must travel as
passengers on national fishery protection boats. These surveillance
programmes are often announced in advance, meaning the inspectorate is
unlikely to be involved in any bruising scenes.
Today's fishermen feel overwhelmed by a tightening net of regulations and
restrictions. They are hemmed round by limits on days at sea, area
restrictions, quotas, and most recently, intentions to limit fishing effort.
'All out rebellion is in the air' as a recent Fishing News leader put it.
Against this picture of unrest among the last of the hunter-gatherers, fish
consumption is rocketing, while improved fishing methods are harvesting the
shrinking resource more efficiently. An effective pan-European fishery
inspectorate may seem inconceivable given the nationalism and widely
differing fishing status and practices of member states. But before fudging
the issues again, politicians should consider how palatable it would be for
the fishing industry in these most fecund waters to wither away as a result
of its own abuses of the environment.
For the sea's boundaries are an abstract concept - an abstraction that is
coming to mean much. It stretches the concept of a non-federalist EU to the
limit. For if EU waters are to replace national ones, as they are
treaty-bound to do, the logical consequence is for EU inspectors to replace
local ones too.
The telephone number for Dourado Sports Fishing, given at the end of an
article by Tom Fort on fishing in Brazil, published on October 29, should
have read: 081-563 1988, fax: 081-563 2230.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Property: Carden Park up for sale - Cadogan's Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Receivers have put developer John Broome's project, Carden Park, Cheshire,
on the market, at the request of the Bank of Scotland.
Broome had set out to produce a hotel, golf, leisure and sport resort of
outstanding quality, spending Pounds 23m in the process.
Carden opened in October 1993 in 730 acres. Broome has established an
18-hole irrigated golf course on ground that varies between pine woods,
parkland and water meadows. Its complement is a beautifully-built golf
academy with a 13-bay driving range.
Carden also offers pheasant shooting on the estate, rough and driven, with
rights over a further 1,400 acres of adjacent land. There is also fishing
and rallying.
Croquet is the surprise. Broome laid down a 4.5-acre croquet lawn, of world
championship standards, which looks big enough to hold 10 games
simultaneously.
A vineyard above the croquet lawn produces a thoroughly drinkable Seyval
Blanc - the grapes go south to Bletchley for pressing - and there are plans
for a swimming pool and exercise centre in the walled kitchen garden.
The garden is some distance from the site of the former 'big house', a
typical Cheshire hall in black and white timbering that burnt down in 1912.
There is a large deer park and Broome's plan was to build a new big house,
or an 80-bedroom extension to the hotel, on the site of the old hall.
The hotel is set out in nine blocks around paved yards, and the rooms
classed as ambassador (lowest), earl, duke or Prince of Wales (one only).
All categories are of unusual comfort and luxury. There are also
self-catering cottages.
Situated near Manchester and Liverpool, and not too far from Birmingham,
this no-expenses-spared development should be a sure success, especially for
the corporate market and for croquet competitions.
Savills (0295-263535) has not indicated a guide price but the sum already
spent gives a top limit. It still needs Pounds 2m-3m for the exercise
centre, a clubhouse for the golf course and a central lounge/bar in the
hotel. Covered walkways between the hotel blocks would also be welcome. A
full information pack is available to serious potential buyers for Pounds
150, plus VAT.
This grand scheme is so nearly complete, and is so well done, that a good
profit must lie in store. Not, alas, for Broome, creator of the highly
successful Alton Towers amusement park, which now belongs to Pearson, owner
of the Financial Times.

In the US, a superb conceit of a house is on sale in Irvington-on-Hudson, 40
minutes by train from Manhattan. I should love to have it. The octagonal
Armour-Stiner house, at 45 West Clinton Avenue, was built in 1872 and has
three acres. It combines the style of Beaux Arts Paris at its most
extravagant with a big traditional American porch with cast iron railings
and elaborate columns and capitals. On top of the dome is an observatory
with views of the Hudson river and the Palisades. The price is a negotiable

No 12 Eaton Square, London SW1, is one of the last seven houses in the
square in single family use. Well-renovated and rich in marble, granite and
wood, this is an important, traditional property.
Its asking price, from Cluttons London Residential (071-584 2044) or De
Groot Collis (071-235 8090), is Pounds 6.75m, with a ground rent, at
present, of Pounds 6,000. It has a small patio garden at the back.

For Dollars 4m, you can escape to a ranch of 120,000 acres in Tanzania, 185
miles north of Dar es Salaam. Mkwaja Ranch has 11,000 head of cattle, a
private beach on the Indian Ocean, an airstrip and its own game reserve with
elephants, hippos, giraffes, lions, hyenas, monkeys and many more species.

All Saints, Langport is the first large medieval church that the diocese of
Bath and Wells has declared redundant, and 'it will certainly not be the
last', warns Philip Nokes, deputy diocesan secretary.
More will follow as congregations amalgamate, but still lack the money to
maintain their fine buildings. And the recent hugely increased parish
payments to the dioceses make it ever harder for the faithful few to keep a
roof over their heads.
At Langport, the parish of 3,000 has another large gem of a medieval church
(Huish Episcopi St Mary), 500 yards away. How could it support two? Which
should go?
Objectors to losing All Saints tried to appeal to the Privy Council. An
attempt to hand it to the Churches Conservation Trust failed, because the
trust did not have the money to take it on.
Now, it is on the market. Cluttons is inviting any reasonable proposal for a
new use, subject to consent from the local council, English Heritage and the
Church Commissioners. No price is set. The sale could be freehold or
leasehold. Grants may be available. Special care must be taken not to
disturb interred human remains.
The alternative to vesting in a trust is conversion or demolition. But
knocking down listed churches and chapels is bound to meet resistance from
councils, conservation bodies and, often, the non-churchgoing community.
Converting churches is tricky. As potential homes, they do not subdivide
well. It needs ingenuity to make them good places in which to live.
Happier adaptations are as studios, workshops, restaurants or concert halls.
Such uses make the most of their generous proportions and are popular with
planning officers as they maintain the 'integrity' of the building.
Unfortunately, the pews which are often part of that integrity will almost
certainly be discarded.
In North Dorset, the council's conservation officer hopes to produce a list
of buildings at risk, to elicit sympathetic buyers.
He has submitted the names of several buildings to SAVE Britain's Heritage,
a pressure group which publishes a similar list entitled 'Stop This Rot: A
Collection of Buildings to Restore in England &amp; Wales', at Pounds 10.95.
One building in Dorset is a wooden chapel built like a wooden barn. If
repaired, it would continue in its present use holding farm machinery. The
Unitarian church, in Gosditch Street, Cirencester, Glos, is in such a
desperate state that the council has served a repairs notice on the church
trustees - the first step to a compulsory purchase order. It could prove a
bargain for a sympathetic new owner. But, as with all church and chapel
conversions, the price depends on the terms of the planning consent.
It can be hard work to define a new use, as architect Richard Pedlar of
Bristol has found with the United Reformed Church at Blakeney, Glos, on the
edge of the Forest of Dean.
This handsome late Georgian building has been on the market for seven years,
although he has had it brought inside the local conservation area and its
listing has been upgraded, which means closer supervision of changes by
English Heritage and the council. This should improve its chances of grant
aid.
His hope is that the Youth Hostels Association will take it, but local
support is vital for the success of such a scheme.
The structure and function of churches and chapels is what makes them so
hard to adapt. Their main job has been as meeting places.
The easiest churches to turn into housing are medieval and Georgian, as they
are built in the domestic tradition. The most difficult are Victorian -
usually great barns of churches with high windows. Yet these - often
marooned in the middle of slum clearance sites and new traffic schemes - are
the most available.
In Fellows Road, London NW3, Winkworth in St John's Wood is selling a
converted four-bedroom chapel, complete with gallery, for Pounds 395,000
(down from Pounds 475,000).
Its Highgate office offers a splendid flat that makes full use of the
stained glass windows in the former United Reformed Church. Priced at Pounds
340,000, and now called Cloisters Court, it is on the corner of Cromwell
Avenue and Hornsey Lane, London N6.
Former Georgian chapels are for sale at Brockenhurst, Hants (Wood, Pounds
140,000), and Blockley, Glos (Jackson-Stops, Pounds 260,000, down from
Pounds 285,000).
Using grants from the government (70 per cent) and the Church Commissioners
(30 per cent) the Churches Conservation Trust (formerly the Redundant
Churches Fund) takes only a very few redundant churches, and these must be
of architectural distinction.
In June it was sheltering 291 churches. The dioceses shelter a few more, as
do the Friends of Friendless Churches.
In June 1993 the Historic Chapels Trust was launched. To date it has two
chapels and is negotiating for another nine.
English Heritage funds 70 per cent of overheads and eligible repairs to the
chapels. The chapels trust must raise the rest privately, but hopes that an
agreement with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool for the
presbytery and chapel of St Benet, Netherton, Merseyside, will set an
example.
The Archdiocese will pay for 30 per cent of the repairs to the group of
buildings.
The most unusual former church on the market is the mostly 14th century St
Michael and All Angels, now Old Church House, on the Grand Union Canal at
Grove, Bucks (Cole Flatt, Pounds 280,000).
The owners converted it 20 years ago out of the smallest church in the
county. It has two bedrooms and many medieval fittings. Are you ready to
live beside a graveyard?

FT  17 DEC 94 / Travel: A day with Hals, Steen and Rembrandt - Adam Hopkins
seeks out locations in Amsterdam which have inspired generations of artists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADAM HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Let's face it, there are plenty of museums in Amsterdam - almost too many.
And they are generally presented as if the noblest of achievements is to
wear out good shoe-leather in them, especially the Rijksmuseum. As a paid-up
lover of Dutch art, I agree, of course - but only up to a point.
How can one fail to be moved by the wide skies and infinite cloudscapes of
the Dutch landscape and water painters; fall willing victim to the bricks
and brooms of Pieter de Hooch's street scenes; or laugh colludingly at Jan
Steen's scenes of family confusion? All this before the bigger guns of
Rembrandt and Vermeer, Frans Hals and latter- day van Gogh are even wheeled
into action.
But the real place to begin in Amsterdam, if you want to enjoy it best and
feel at least some of the impulse that drove the painters, is with the
actual subject-matter they depicted. Much of it still exists in this most
eye-catching of cities.
Start with the canals, the greatest of them devised in 1609 by an inspired
town planner and dug a little later in a majestic triple ring -
Prinzengracht, Keizersgracht and Herengracht - around two thirds of the
city, giving it the curious horsehoe shape which it has never lost.
Rembrandt and company were at the height of their powers during this
undertaking and there is little in Europe that is lovelier than to submit to
the canal-side scene of the 17th century, the interplay of brick and gable,
leaf and branch and water, with the narrow, delicate canal houses aspiring
ever upward, their fronts as full of windows as a Dutch East Indiaman of
square-rigged sails.
The multiplicity of human characters that Rembrandt featured may not persist
in quite the same form - all seems a little more uniform today  - but there
is still a huge variety to experience: faces and demeanours Dutch and
Indonesian, Surinamese and South Moluccan, faces of the old Dutch empire,
faces - counting in oneself and other visitors - from everywhere.
Then, to take a more concrete example, there is the ever-appealing flower
market on the Singel canal, which is itself a modern version of an older
market now infilled at the back of the town hall. The original can still be
found in quite a few 17th century paintings of the city - I came on an
example just the other day in the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection in Madrid
and there are others in Amsterdam's engaging Historical Museum.
The town hall, a grandly classical building endlessly represented by the
painters, still exists just as it was. A 10-minute walk, alongside the main
road or canal, will bring you from Dam Square and the town hall to the
delightful West Church or Westerkerk - sketched by Rembrandt - with the
pompous crown of the Habsburg Archduke Maximilian on its tower.
Rembrandt is buried in the interior, exact spot unknown, and there is a
statue of Anne Frank, who lived and suffered just 100 yards away, outside
the church's door.
Across the canal here is the old working-class district of the Jordaan, much
given in the 19th and early 20th centuries to revolutionary disturbances,
themselves often depicted by the painters of the day. This is another
excellent district for strolling.
And back on the far side of town, close by the often-choppy river Amstel -
which of course gives its name to the whole city - you will find swing
bridges of the type that van Gogh favoured.
You do not need to know the painterly references to enjoy a canalside start
to Amsterdam - it all becomes crystal clear when you finally hit the museums
 -but you can certainly pick up a trick or two from the painters as you
progress.
For yet another enduring aspect of Amsterdam is its excellent pubs and
eateries, much patronised by the painters when they were flush.
You could start right in the middle of town, close to the History Museum.
Here Haesje Claas in Spuistraat will offer you traditional Dutch grub in a
cosy, old-fashioned atmosphere, the sort of interior the painters often
showed.
You can imagine the kind of food - a stampott, say, featuring curly kale and
meatballs.
Or, more my line at mid-day, the old and pretty pub of Hoppe, right on Spui
square, will serve an excellent cold beer, while Kootje van Brootje, a
superior sandwich bar next door, proffers soft white rolls with raw herring
and onion.
(Those in the mood could skip the beer and go for a quick shot of Dutch gin,
the rougher young or yonge being preferable, in my opinion, to the smoother
oude. In which case they might end up like someone in a Jan Steen painting.)
There are other restaurants round here for evening time - the posh and
sometimes touristy but always entertaining Five Flies (more properly d'Viff
Vlieghen), with its host of ancient little dining rooms and quirky corners
(more Dutch interiors), or Lucius, where the effort goes into the excellence
of the fish-dinners.
But as with the canals, one ought to range a bit. How about an Indonesian
rijstaffel, many-dished, in Tempo Doelo near the Rembrandtsplein? Or a hint
of designer sophistication at Les Quatre Papillons - one of the four chefs,
the so -called papillons, is English.
As for the Jordaan district, it is much less known to visitors. Steer by
nose - almost all pubs serve food as well as drink. Last time I was passing
I had a meal (evenings only) in de Reiger - the name means Heron - in Nieuwe
Leliestraat, and very good, and very homely, it was too.
Which brings one, finally, to the museums. The History Museum, of course, is
excellent. One could say the same of the Maritime Museum, although it is
vast and you will not want to see it all; as is the much-lauded Jewish
Museum.
But really, I suppose, we are talking Rijksmuseum for historic Dutch
painting, van Gogh Museum for the one-eared master, and the Stedelijk for
international modern.
Although the van Gogh can be done as a single - and extraordinarily
illuminating - whole, it would take days to get right round the other two.
My own tactic is to pick just one or two painters at a time (the guidebooks
come in very handy here) and otherwise concentrate on the canals and
eateries, and even, maybe, take a quick flip through the red light district.
That way I may not get much wiser but I certainly feel I get into the
spirit.
Adam Hopkins visited Amsterdam as a guest of Travelscene, tel: 081-427 4445,
staying at the excellent Pulitzer Hotel on the Prinzengracht, a series of
converted canalside houses joined to make a single, decidedly upmarket,
hostelry. Flight by Transavia from Gatwick. Three nights, two sharing,
breakfast, airport transfer, from Pounds 314.
Restaurants: medium price - Haesje Claas, Spuistraat 275, (tel: 62649998)
and Les Quatre Papillons, Beuliingstraat 5-7 (6261912); expensive - de
d'Viff Vlieghen, Spuistraat 294 (248369) and Lucius, Spuistraat 247,
(6241831); economic - Tempo Doelo, Utrechtsestraat 75 (6256718) and de
Reiger, Nieuwe Leliestraat 34, (6247426).
Food prices are comparable to London, maybe a shade lower, although you
certainly have to watch wine costs.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Travel: By bus in Guatemala - Mark Hodson has an eventful
journey by public transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK HODSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jose sat beside me wearing red and white pin-striped trousers and black
leather chaps. He had a long straight Mayan nose and dry black skin like
crumpled linen. On his head, at a slight angle, sat a straw boater.
He was taking the bus home from market, along with his wife and two young
daughters and a chicken in a cardboard box. They lived in Todos Santos
Cuchumatan, in the mountains of north-west Guatemala.
Jose was a Nam Indian, a true descendant of the ancient Maya yet, like his
village, his name was Spanish. The conquistadors had made the arduous trek
to Todos Santos even before a road was built to connect it to the outside
world.
The Spaniards converted the inhabitants to Roman Catholicism, gave them new
names and a distinctive local costume. Legend has it that the men of Todos
Santos were so taken by the finery worn by one particularly flamboyant
Spaniard that they all copied it.
Today, the villagers still make the straw hats by hand and a boy does not
properly become a man until he is allowed to wear the red shirt with its
brightly patterned cuffs and upturned collars.
The bus pulled out of Huehuetenango with a few nervous coughs and a loud
roar. I shared a seat built for two with Jose and his family. One of the
girls was allocated to me and she sat on my lap for the entire journey
staring silently up at my alien face.
As we approached a police checkpoint the conductor told everyone to crouch
on the floor. There were 20 or 50 people standing in the aisle and they all
obliged, the men gently laying down their machetes, the women heaving babies
on to nearby laps.
We made it through but at a second checkpoint we were stopped and a
policeman noticed the bus was illegally overloaded. A small fine was
negotiated and we were off again.
For anyone over 5ft 6in tall, the seats were horribly cramped - the bus had
been designed to carry American schoolchildren. Above the windscreen,
between a blaring tape deck and a picture of the Virgin Mary, a faded sign
warned: 'No Swearing, No Horseplay.'
After 20 minutes we ran out of road and started to climb a lush mountain,
rarely getting out of first gear and hardly topping walking pace. The
driver, a man in his 40s with sunglasses, a greasy quiff and a row of silver
teeth, handed over the wheel to his conductor so he could chat up a woman
passenger.
An hour later we reached the peak and pulled up at a lonely truck stop
10,000ft above sea level. The men filed off, loosened their chaps and
relieved themselves against the side of the bus.
They did not speak much. Spanish remains their second language and they
would smile and exchange pleasantries but little more.
After a light lunch of Coca-Cola and dried cakes we were back on the road
crossing a stark barren plain. We dropped into a steep valley.
We could see Todos Santos spread out below us when we heard another bus
behind, hooting and snarling as it tried to pass on the narrow dirt road.
Our driver refused to pull over even when he stopped to set down passengers.
The other driver jumped out of his cab and ran up to our bus, swinging a
machete, stamping his feet and howling obscenities.
Our driver pulled away, stopping on the next bend to let the other bus pass.
As it did so a young man stood in the doorway of the other vehicle, and
waved the machete. With a flash of steel he slashed one of our tyres and we
ground to another halt.
Todos Santos was a picture of peace and tranquillity. Around the whitewashed
colonial church half a dozen young men leant in doorways, talking in
whispers and coyly posing in their brilliant costumes. Families sat outside
their adobe huts weaving: women at the looms, children bundling up cotton
and men sewing little bags.
The villagers had set up a workers' co-operative and their tiny shop was
packed with colourful weavings, each with a tag showing the name of the
person who had made it.
Next day, I saw a funeral. Half a dozen small children were walking down the
main street in single file, each holding a peace lily and solemnly staring
ahead. Behind them a boy of about 14 supported the rough-hewn coffin of a
child across his shoulders as if he was carrying his own cross.
He was followed by a dozen women in dazzling red blouses and skirts. None
displayed any emotion. It was exquisite and heart-breaking.
There was just one restaurant in town which served the same meal of
scrambled eggs, black beans and tortillas for breakfast, lunch and dinner,
and a hostel with horse-hair beds in draughty rooms that got hellishly cold
at night. I lasted two days before I got back on that bus.
This time we broke down after just 45 minutes. A second bus took us back to
Huehuetenango where I found I had missed the connection east to Sacapulas
and would have to wait until morning.
Next day at 11am I was back on the road with another lunatic at the wheel
who hurled us around the winding mountain roads until after two hours we
shuddered to a halt when the transmission shaft snapped. I sat at the side
of the road dreaming of cold beer, watching a herd of oxen overtake us and
thinking that even by Guatemalan standards three breakdowns on the trot must
be considered pretty bad luck.
A United Nations truck pulled up but the driver refused to give us a ride so
we had to wait two hours for the next bus. When it came it was already
nearly full but the driver seemed so pleased to see a rival broken down that
he made sure everyone squeezed on.
By the time we reached the little crossroads town of Sacapulas at the foot
of the Cuchumatan mountains it was almost dusk. I had missed the last
connecting bus to the village of Nebaj and was looking for a cold drink when
a lorry driver offered me a lift.
He was leaving immediately so I clambered up the back of his open truck,
clinging to the edge as we thundered high into the hills. I turned and
through the swirling dust saw a warm golden sunset over the valley. I looked
down to find myself standing on a mountain of wooden crates filled with
beer.
Journey Latin America (081-747 8515) take escorted groups through Guatemala,
Mexico and Belize, staying in budget hotels and using public buses. Prices
for 20-day trips start at Pounds 1,210 including flights, but not
accommodation.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Travel: A journey to feed the body and soul - Paul Betts, in
Burgundy, tastes abbeys, basilicas and churches, and worships at the
region's heathen temples to gastronomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gastronomic pilgrimage started at L'Abbaye Saint-Michel. Overlooking the
town of Tonnerre, near the vineyards of Chablis, the Benedictine abbey had
long been a favourite stop for pilgrims on their way south during the Middle
Ages.
There are no monks left these days. Instead, the abbey has been converted
into a plush four-star Relais et Chateaux hotel with a two-star Michelin
restaurant.
On a sunny December Friday, the abbey, carefully restored by its owner
Daniel Cussac, a public works engineer, was hushed. We had arrived from
London on a long weekend tour of northern Burgundy to combine the best
tables of the region with its rich monastic culture. With Christmas
approaching, it seemed an appropriate cocktail: total unashamed gluttony
blended with spiritual meditation.
There has always been an affinity between food and religion, even though the
great Cistercian abbeys of Burgundy were built as a reaction to secular
excess. The Cistercian order was founded at the end of the 11th century as
an antidote to the sumptuous rituals and materialistic trappings of the
Benedictines. No Dom Perignon for them. They believed in simplicity and
nature.
'For God's sake. If men are not ashamed of these follies, why do they not
shrink at least from the expense,' wrote St Bernard, the guiding spirit of
the Cistercians. The same could apply today to the prices of top restaurants
in the area.
We were alone in the big dining room overlooking the cloister gardens where
two characters out of Clochemerle were trying to fix the drains. Christophe
Cussac, the son of Daniel, had prepared what was described as a light lunch:
Pot au Feu de Foie Gras Paysanne; Ailerons de Volaille aux Raviolis
d'Epoisses; Bar a la Peau au Cidre du Pays d'Othe; Rognonnade d'Agneau aux
Courgettes a la Grecque; Fromages; Gaufrettes a la Poudre de Miel;
Friandises.
Monsieur Cussac fils is a small, shy man who worked under Joel Robuchon,
arguably the best contemporary chef in France. Robuchon trained to be a
priest but found his true vocation in cooking. The religious connection was
taking deeper root.
We left Monsieur Cussac, worrying about filling his monastery in the
off-season in a region which has traditionally been a one-night stopover for
travellers heading to the Mediterranean or back north.
Lunch had only been an appetiser. We headed towards Joigny for the Cote
Saint Jacques: the first of the trinity of famous three-star Michelin
restaurant we were going to try.
In the hills, they were already pruning the vines, a job which, ideally,
should be done in March. But the vineyards in this northern part of Burgundy
have been expanding since the growers discovered techniques to overcome the
spring frosts. As the sun was setting, thin trails of smoke rose from the
hills from the small stacks of burning cut vines, as if the wine growers of
Chablis were electing a new Pope.
The Cote Saint Jacques sits on the main road running through the old town of
Joigny on the banks of the Yonne. It is a typical maison bourgeoise, which
was converted 40 years into a modest pension by Marie Lorain.
The youngest of her four children, Michel, who trained as a pastry chef,
took over the running of the roadside inn in 1958 with his wife, Jacqueline.
Over the years, they have transformed the Cote Saint Jacques, together with
their son, Jean-Michel, into one of the country's most prestigious
restaurants, where a typical menu costs about FFr600 (Pounds 71.34), and a
luxurious Relais et Chateaux hotel.
Inside, it is a slick, stylish establishment. Its modest burgundian roots
have been replaced by the Parisian idea of rustic chic. The Lorains are
equally slick: so polished and polite that you feel there is never a tantrum
in the kitchen.
The bedrooms are in another house on the other side of the road on the river
bank. To avoid guests being run over, or catching a cold in their evening
gowns, the huge rooms are reached through an underground tunnel. The result
is a sense of amnesia: stuck in the middle of nowhere surrounded by the sort
of luxury that would make a bank manager tremble.
We sat in the candlelit dining room, with waiters in black patent leather
shoes breezing around as they delivered the terrine of oysters, the scallops
in a cappucino froth, the lobster galette, the hare, a pineapple shaped like
a straw hat worn by a paddy field worker, more puddings, chocolates and
little sorbets.
Food at this level is an art form, at least it is venerated as such in
France. Michel Lorain appeared and gave a small audience to each table. He
told us he had composed an English menu for the Meridien hotel in
Piccadilly, London. 'I looked up some old English recipes in an old cook
book,' he said. 'I cooked steak, kidney and oyster pie, but each ingredient
separately to avoid confusing the tastes too much.' He was drooling a
little. His hands were slicing the imaginary products as he talked with the
movements of a skilled surgeon.
For a Friday night, the restaurant was not full. It was a bad time of year,
but the long recession in France has not helped just as the new motorways
have diverted travellers away from the traditional Burgundy staging posts.
It has made holding on to three stars all the more important because there
are people still prepared to scour the world to pay any price for a French
gastronomic experience. Two stars, forget it.
The three-star restaurateurs have also been forced to make concessions to
the modest no-star customers to maintain the necessary cashflow to support
the heavy costs and risks of running a top table. On the other side of the
river, the Lorain family have built a new hotel, Le Rive Gauche, with
affordable rooms and meals.
It was still sunny on Saturday and time to revive the spirits and the soul.
We stopped briefly at the Cistercian abbey of Pontigny, visited by Thomas
Becket in exile and resting place of St Edmund Rich, the Archbishop of
Canterbury who fell out with Henry III. These days, Potigny continues to
attract English pilgrims.
At Fontenay, about half an hour's drive away, Hubert Aynard was waiting. He
is the happy owner of probably the best preserved Cistercian abbey in the
world, which has been designated since 1981 as a 'universal heritage' site
by Unesco. Set in a valley of woods and streams, the abbey was founded by St
Bernard in 1118. It is a perfect example of his spiritual aesthetics. 'What
is God? He is length, width, height and depth,' he said. It is all there in
its utopian simplicity.
The abbey's more recent story is equally magnificent. After the French
Revolution, all religious life ceased at Fontenay and the Directory put the
property up for sale in 1791 for FFr78,000. It became a paper mill until
Edouard Aynard, a banker from Lyons, bought the place in 1906 from his
father in law, Raymond de Montgolfier. Sparing no expense, he set about
restoring the abbey. Subsequent generations have continued his work.
In the abbot's house, Hubert Aynard explained that industry in the case of
Fontenay had helped preserve, rather than destroy, the monastic complex. The
paper mill buildings had been added on to the original monastery. They had
acted as wrapping paper and when they were pulled down, the original stones
and structures were virtually all there.
We left Aynard, who lives at Fontenay and keeps the abbey open all year
round, for another shrine. St-Pere-sous-Vezelay is a little village nestling
at the foot of the monumental basilica of Vezelay, once one of the great
capitals of Christianity, visited by crowds of pilgrims to pray by the
relics of Mary Magdalene. More come these days to eat at Marc Meneau's
L'Esperance.
Meneau is a local boy from St-Pere, a self-taught cook who has come to be
regarded in France as one of the country's most unconventional gastronomic
giants. If Lorain has risen to three-star Michelin stardom thanks to his
inventive but safe cuisine, Meneau has done so by his extravagant, extrovert
and sensual approach to food. 'You either like what he does, or hate it,'
said one local connoisseur. 'But it is very sexy.'
Meneau converted his mother's village grocery store into a flashy restaurant
and hotel, with a whiff of decadence and a strange combination of kitsch and
good taste.
On Saturday night the restaurant was full. The staff was working overtime
and lacked the polish of the Cote Saint Jacques. There followed a sequence
of the most extraordinary culinary experiments: walnut soup; a spoon with a
lump of pan fried mash potatoes stuffed with caviar; a croquette filled with
what I think was foie gras diluted in Marc de Bourgogne; sensuous open
shellfish held on the big round plate by some gooey substance followed by a
cold shell fish cream with lobster jelly in the middle; turbot served with
hunks of bone marrow; and on and on.
Presidents and princes have regularly dined at L'Esperance to discover the
textures, aromas and flavours of the local countryside which Meneau blends
in his dishes.
Serge Gainsbourg, the enfant terrible who died of drink and cigarettes last
year, spent months at a time at L'Esperance. He would play on the piano late
in the night at the bar and, one year, organised a massive fireworks display
on New Year's Eve. He dropped FFr500 tips and has left fond memories in this
small corner of Burgundy. His epitaph could have read 'When you've lost all
hope you turn to L'Esperance.'
It was nearly 2am and Meneau, a strong, arresting man, was puffing a
bazooka-size cigar. I stupidly asked why you never get a decent portion of
vegetables in a three-star restaurant. 'It's not aesthetic,' he said
dismissively.
Like Lorain, Meneau has also expanded with a new annex and a lower-priced
restaurant. But the economic climate was improving. His indicator - Romanee
Conti, the prince of Burgundies, which sells for FFr4000 to FFr6000 a bottle
in the restaurant - was telling him so. 'We used to sell about one a month.
It went down to one every seven months. Now we are back to about one every
two months.'
We left Vezelay on Sunday, after high mass in the basilica, for Saulieu, our
last epicurian stop. La Cote d'Or has been a popular stopping place for more
than a century. But it became internationally famous in the 1950s when
Alexandre Dumaine turned it into a gastronomic milestone for the jet set of
the day travelling down the Nationale 6 from Paris to the Riviera.
Bernard Loiseau and his wife acquired the hotel in 1982 and at great expense
restablished its reputation as a French gastronomic landmark. For Loiseau
his three Michelin stars are a matter of life and death. 'Our business
virtually doubled over night when we won our third star,' explained Madame
Loiseau. 'It would be a disaster if we should lose one,' she added,
explaining that they have had to borrow heavily over the years to expand and
modernise the restaurant and hotel.
Bernard Loiseau is a perfectionist who as a teenager was already dreaming to
become a great chef. His restaurant was also a good choice to end our
gastronomic tour because Loiseau has created a light cuisine using
water-based and wine sauces and as little fat as possible. 'You won't find a
single pot of cream in the kitchen,' said Mme Loiseau.
We ate lentil soup, pike-perch on a bed of shallots in a wine sauce, a
pigeon, chocolate pudding. One would not have felt full if one had not spent
the last 48 hours eating.
On the motorway, rushing back to catch the evening flight from Orly to
London, I was asked by my other two companions which restaurant I preferred.
It was impossible to answer, but I suppose, I said, I would take my wife to
La Cote Saint Jacques, my mistress to L'Esperance, my mother to la Cote d'Or
and my mother in law at L'Abbaye Saint-Michel.
I dozed off and started thinking of Alfonse Daudet's lovely Christmas story
of the parish priest who raced through Midnight Mass to get to the party
traditionally held after the service as quickly as possible. He stuffed
himself silly that night and exploded. But that was a bit further down in
Chateau Neuf du Pape.
Information: I was a guest of the Comite Regional du Tourisme for Burgundy,
Relais et Chateaux hotels and Air France. L'Abbaye Saint-Michel, 89700
Tonnerre, tel 86 55 05 99. La Cote Saint Jacques, 89300 Joigny (86 62 09
70). L'Esperance, 89450 St-Pere-sous-Vezelay (86 33 39 10). La Cote d'Or,
21210 Saulieu (80 64 07 66).

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: CGT indexation allowances - November
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
The table shows capital gains tax indexation allowances for assets sold
in November. Multiply the original cost of the asset by the figure for
the month in which you bought it. Subtract the result from the proceeds
of your sale: the balance will be your taxable gain or loss. Suppose you
bought shares for Pounds 6,000 in November 1985 and sold them in
November 1994 for Pounds 13,000. Multiplying the original cost by the
November 1985 figure of 1.515 gives a total of Pounds 9,090.
Subtracting that from Pounds 13,000 gives a capital gain of Pounds 3,910
which is within the CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800. If selling shares
bought before April 6 1982, you should use the March 1982 figure. The
RPI in November 1994 was 145.3.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Let's not talk turkey this year - Cookery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cooks who have cooked more Christmas turkeys than they care to remember
often dream about, and may even plan on, serving something different on
December 25. But when it comes to the crunch the conservative will of the
family nearly always wins.
Ah well. Console yourself with the thought that if you give in and stick to
the inevitable bird and all its trimmings that large family gatherings seem
to expect and demand, at least the Christmas day mood in your household will
be more peaceable than in those in which novelty has been forced on the
natives.
It is only when small groups of like-minded adults join forces, and children
and grandparents are notably absent, that alternative Christmas celebrations
stand any real chance of coming to happy fruition.
For those who have managed to escape the year-in year-out routine, here are
some celebratory suggestions that centre on seafood rather than poultry.
Those committed to the same old Christmas menu as usual might like to save
these ideas for January dinner parties.
DOVER SOLE WITH OYSTERS AND MUSHROOMS
Three good size Dover soles are enough to serve four people as a main
course, or six as a first course, but as this is Christmas I would use four
fish. Ask the fishmonger to skin and fillet them for you and bring home all
the trimmings - essential flavourings for the sauce.
4 fine plump Dover soles; 1 1/2 dozen oysters; 4-6 oz chestnut mushrooms;
1/2 pt double cream; 2 tablespoons Noilly Prat; half a lemon; 2 tbsp chopped
parsley.
Simmer the fish trimmings and mushroom stalks in 1 1/2 pt water for half an
hour. Strain and reduce to  3/4 pt to concentrate flavour. Just  1/2 pt is
needed for this dish. Save the remaining  1/4 pt for another day (you could
use it, for example, to make the scallop and squash ravioli recipe given
below). Boil the Noilly Prat until reduced by half, mix it with  1/2 pt of
the stock, season lightly and reserve.
Slice the mushrooms, put them into a small saucepan with the cream, some sea
salt and a grinding of pepper. Half-cover and bring very slowly to simmering
point. Remove the lid and simmer for about 10 minutes until the liquid is
somewhat reduced and sticky. Stir occasionally during this time to prevent a
skin from forming. Set aside.
Shuck the oysters. Lay the sole fillets in a buttered gratin dish and pour
the oyster juices over them. Add a grinding of pepper and a squeeze of lemon
and lay butter paper over the top. (Everything up to this stage can be done
ahead.)
Cook the fish on a pre-heated baking sheet in the oven at 375'F-400'F
(190'C-200'C) gas mark 5-6 for 5-6 minutes. Transfer the fish carefully to a
warmed serving dish and keep hot while you finish the sauce.
Boil the sole cooking liquor for a minute or two and gently reheat the
mushroom cream. Add the first to the second and bring back to simmering
point. Continue simmering briefly if needs be to achieve good consistency.
Chop the oysters roughly and slip them into the pan. Stir to immerse them,
then quickly cover with the lid and turn out the flame but leave the pan
where it is for 5 minutes. That way the oysters will heat through without
danger of toughening.
When time is up, check seasoning, spoon the creamy mixture over the fish and
sprinkle lightly with parsley - like a green backbone down the centre of the
dish.
SCALLOP AND SQUASH RAVIOLI
Decorative and flavoursome, this will serve six as a not-too-substantial
main course. To make more of a meal of it add extra scallops or large raw
prawns freshly grilled. If possible enlist a pair of helping hands for the
final stage of cooking so one of you can sear the scallops while the other
deals with the pasta, then both can assemble the dish.
10 fine scallops; 1 butternut squash; 8 sheets lasagne, home-made or bought
(fresh not dried); 1 oz sun-dried tomatoes in oil, drained and cut into
snippets; 2-3 table-spoons toasted pinenuts; a bunch of basil; 1 generous
teaspoon finely chopped ginger root; 1 generous teaspoon coriander seed,
freshly toasted in a dry frying pan and reduced to a powder; 2 garlic cloves
and 1 onion, both finely chopped; 4 fl oz richly flavoured fish stock; 4 fl
oz freshly squeezed orange juice and the finely grated zest of 1 orange; 4
tablespoons olive oil; 3 oz butter.
Halve and seed the squash and steam it for 10-12 minutes until tender. Blot
dry, peel and quarter the flesh. Cut most of it into  1/4 inch thick slices.
Dice the rest finely. Cover and reserve.
Clean the scallops, gently separate the corals from the whites and slice
each white across into two or three discs depending on the plumpness of the
cushion. Set aside.
Sweat the onion for 10 minutes in the oil in a heavy-based pan with a well
fitting lid. Add the garlic and ginger and sweat for 10 minutes more.
Cut the pasta into large ravioli squares and prepare the other ingredients
as described in the ingredients list. (Everything up to this stage can be
done ahead.)
Add 1 oz butter to the onion pan. When it has melted and the mixture is hot
stir in the coriander and sun-dried tomatoes. Add the orange juice, zest and
squash. Cover tightly and cook over a minimal flame for about 15 minutes
until everything is well heated through. Shake and stir the contents of the
pan once or twice and season with salt and pepper after the first five
minutes.
When ready, lift most of the solids out of the pan with a slotted spoon
(leaving some of the diced squash, onion and flavourings behind with the
liquid) and keep them hot in a covered dish in a low oven.
Add the stock to the pan and the remaining 2 oz butter cut into dice. Let
the mixture bubble up and blend to make a rich sauce and check seasoning.
Meanwhile, cook and drain the pasta and sear the scallops in batches in a
hot saute pan barely filmed with oil. Scallops need only to glance at the
heat; turn and remove them in the order in which you added them to the pan,
and keep them hot with the squash.
Finally, to assemble the open ravioli, lay some of the pasta squares on a
warmed serving dish. Spoon some of the filling over them, sprinkle with
freshly torn basil leaves, cover with more pasta squares and pour on some of
the sauce. Add extra layers in the same way, ending with the last of the
sauce. Scatter with the pine-nuts and strew with basil for the sake of its
colour and sweet peppery bite.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Something to go with the kangaroo fillet? -
Jancis Robinson begins a two-part look at Australian wines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just back from 10 days in Australia and what sticks in my mind? The
juiciest, fruitiest little oysters I have ever had in my life, from the west
coast of South Australia and now feared as commercial rivals to the Sydney
rock versions; a boned, spiced quail sitting on a couscous salad with fresh
date chutney; meltingly tender kangaroo fillet in chilli and black bean
sauce . . .
Oh, and I believe I washed down Australia's dynamic new cuisine with the odd
glass of wine - some of it just as exciting and mould-breaking. Come to
think of it, I do not think I drank a single overtly oaky Chardonnay - the
wine style with which the Australians wooed the now-infatuated British - the
whole time I was there.
Australia continues to refine its wine styles. Over-oaked, heavy wines are
becoming a thing of the past - in fact, within Australia, oak is now seen as
an enemy to be tamed.
Many wines are sold with the word 'unoaked' on the label, typically carrying
a price premium above basic Chardonnay.
The cheaper product's fruit is often given 'oak flavour' by oak chips rather
than by maturation in barrels, which can cost as much as ADollars 1,000
(Pounds 450) apiece once they have been shipped from France, although the
Australian wine industry is one of the better customers of the American oak
barrel business.
Australia's new pride in its widely planted Shiraz (the Rhone's noble Syrah)
has been a delight to behold - and I even got the faint impression that
Cabernet Sauvignon was out of favour, although admittedly I spent most of my
time in the Barossa Valley, Australia's Shirazshire.
Another noticeable trend is that Australia, like California, is developing
its own band of Rhone Rangers, producers cherishing other vine varieties
commonly - if in some cases erroneously - associated with France's Rhone
Valley. As in California, Grenache and Mataro (aka Mourvedre) were scorned
as cheap workhorse varieties for years, until their respective direct links
with Chateauneuf-du-Pape and Bandol were recognised.
Today dry-farmed (non-irrigated) Grenache from the likes of Rockford and
Turkey Flat (grape-grower Peter Schulz's fruit made at Rockford) is offered
with pride in the smarter restaurants of Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne.
Another cult wine is RBJ Theologicum, a gamey blend of Grenache and
Mourvedre from the Barossa (the 1993 is Pounds 7.49 from the Australian Wine
Centre).
And was it my hopeful imagination or was Riesling actually making a comeback
as opposed to being about to? These racy, dry wines make a great alternative
aperitif to champagne.
Certainly Australia is now a seriously useful source of well-made sweet
wines, typically about Pounds 7 a half bottle, that can, often should, be
drunk young. They are not desperately popular in Australia itself and so it
is up to us to encourage their producers to continue with this painstaking
sideline.
In Britain there are still scores of beautifully made wines to be found in
the price bracket Australia continues to do best, Pounds 5-Pounds 10ish a
bottle, and a high proportion of them are sold by the Australian Wine Centre
(AWC). Tel: 0800-716893 until December 22 at 50 Strand, London WC2 and
afterwards by mail order only.
WHITES:
Primo Estate Colombard 1994, Pounds 5.99, Australian Wine Centre (AWC).
Charmingly idiosyncratic wine made from a grape variety that is usually dull
as ditchwater, but in the hands of Joe Grilli (the 'Joseph' of the cult red
wine Moda Amarone), these grapes ripened under the merciless sun of the
Adelaide Plains become a full-bodied, spicy, fruity, dry white.
Stafford Ridge Lenswood Riesling 1991, Pounds 6.75, Adnams of Southwold;
Pounds 6.99, AWC. Geoff Weaver releases his Riesling late, and here is the
closest the Adelaide Hills get to Alsace. Definitely dry (which not all
Australian Rieslings are), long and kernel-scented.
Chapel Hill Eden Valley Riesling 1993, Pounds 6.49, AWC and Bottoms Up.
Pure, long, intensely aromatic.
St Hallett's Chardonnay 1993, Tesco, Thresher etc, Pounds 7.49. Big, broad
Barossa-style of Chardonnay but with enough subtlety to convince an
extremely experienced Burgundian blind taster that it was made with French
and not American oak.
Ironstone Semillon Chardonnay, Pounds 5.99, Majestic, Fullers, Cellar 5.
Truly interesting South Western Australian that smells of tangy Semillon,
but has the weight of carefully grown Chardonnay - a less expensive label
from Cape Mentelle.
Rothbury Hunter Valley Chardonnay 1993, Pounds 5.99, Oddbins, Davisons and
Marco's shops around London. First-class value for medal-winning liquid
gold. Buy lots of this vintage; the Hunter is suffering dreadfully from
drought.
Petaluma Chardonnay 1992, Pounds 9.99, Oddbins. Very good price for this
level of sophistication from the cool Adelaide Hills. Great delicacy for the
moment, but this one is worth hanging on to until the four to eight-year-old
'drinking window' recommended by its maker Brian Croser.
Shaw &amp; Smith Reserve Chardonnay 1993, Pounds 10.99, Winecellars. Textbook
early-1990s barrel-fermented Chardonnay. Where will fashion take us from
here - back to matchsticks in pineapple juice?
Henschke Croft Chardonnay 1992, Pounds 11.95, Lay &amp; Wheeler, of Colchester,
Essex. Savoury oak, appetising. A third fine Chardonnay from the Adelaide
Hills.
Primo Estate Botrytis Riesling 1993, Pounds 7.99 a half, AWC and Harvey
Nichols, London SW1. Pure but not for purists, as this was made by inducing
the botrytis mould at the winery rather than in the vineyard, but for me it
is a delightfully racy sweet wine without the clout of a Griffith Semillon.
REDS
Peter Lehmann Vine Vale Shiraz 1992, Pounds 3.99. OK, so it is less than
Pounds 5, but do not complain, just enjoy the oomph.
Chateau Reynella Basket Press Cabernet/Merlot and Shiraz 1992, Pounds 6.49
each from Oddbins. Evidence of Australia's new pride in 'old-fashioned' wine
technology.
Chapel Hill Cabernet Sauvignon, Pounds 7.99 Tesco, Thresher and Pounds 8.99
AWC. The AWC will soon have some of Pam Dunsford's miraculous 1992 vintage,
which was voted best of the best at this year's Canberra show. It is
deliciously suave and persuasive now but should get even better. The 1991,
which Tesco is selling at Pounds 7.99, during December, is also worth taking
seriously and it is expected to stock the 1992 next spring. Cape Mentelle
Cabernet/Merlot 1992, Pounds 7.49, Majestic. This is the bargain from the
Western Australian arm of the company that brought you Cloudy Bay, although
alcohol freaks should be thrilled by the zany Zinfandel 1991 stocked by
Adnams of Southwold at Pounds 8.95, and bargain hunters may prefer the
cheaper Ironstone label.
Coldstream Hills Pinot Noir 1993, Pounds 8.49, Oddbins. Lavishly refinanced
and on a medal-winning roll, this Victorian winery run by the wine writer
James Halliday has Australia's surest touch with the red burgundy grape -
although Bannockburn can be damn fine too, as indeed is the Tasmanian
Freycinet (join the waiting list on Boxford Wine, 0787-210187).
Henschke Abbott's Prayer Merlot/Cabernet 1992, Pounds 12.95, Lay &amp; Wheeler.
Very superior stuff, apparently designed to win over those who find most
Australian reds just too big.
Yeringberg Cabernets 1990, Pounds 13.75, Bibendum of London NW1. Gorgeously
fashioned, serious, glossy, fine claret from the Yarra Valley.
Yarra Yering Dry Reds, Pounds 16.99, Oddbins. Majestically idiosyncratic,
just like its maker, the donnish Victorian Dr Bailey Carrodus.
E &amp; E Black Pepper Shiraz 1990/91, Pounds 13.49/Pounds 12.75, Eckington
Wines of Sheffield (0246-433213). This is the sort of strapping red Aussies
themselves fight over.
Next week: why the next two Australian vintages may prove crucial.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Take control of your
pension - Debbie Harrison examines a top-up plan that provides access to
low-cost equity funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Gordon, a qualified accountant, asked Weekend Money to check the
availability of a special type of top-up plan for a company pension scheme.
'What I am looking for,' he explained, 'is a plan that provides 100 per cent
exposure to the UK equity market with a return that matches the FT-A
All-Share index. I'd like to combine this with minimum front-end costs and
annual management fees.'
One option worth considering is a little-known arrangement that allows
employees in occupational pension schemes to take control of their top-up
pension plans and gain access to low-cost, 100 per cent equity funds.
It appears that only one company - Personal Pensions Management (PPM) -
offers 'self-invested' free-standing additional voluntary contributions
(FSAVCs). Through the self-invested version, you can put money directly into
equities, authorised unit trusts (including index-tracking funds) and
investment trusts at more competitive rates than you get under standard life
office FSAVCs.
Self-invested FSAVCs are similar in many ways to self-invested personal
pensions (Sipps), which were introduced in the 1989 Budget to allow
knowledgeable investors either to run their own pension portfolio or appoint
a stockbroker to do it for them. The administration and legal documentation
is handled separately by a life office.
The beauty of this arrangement is that once you separate the two main
functions - investment and administration - you can, if you are dissatisfied
with the performance, change the stockbroker or investment manager without
having to change the provider.
Under a standard personal pension, where these two functions are combined,
you have to change the entire package and may lose out through
early-termination penalties.
Sipps can be used only by employees who are not in company pension schemes,
and the self-employed. Until recently, employees who wanted to top up their
company scheme benefits had to choose between their employer's in-house AVC
scheme, which often is invested conservatively, or take out an individual
FSAVC sold mainly by life offices.
Low-risk, in-house AVCs are ideal for employees close to retirement, but
younger pension scheme members are advised to go for funds with a high
equity content. FSAVCs offer a wide investment choice but can be expensive
to run.
In October 1992, the Inland Revenue confirmed that the self-invested option
applied also to FSAVCs. Initially, the charges on these plans were
considered to be high, but reductions have made them more competitive these
days.
PPM, part of the Swiss insurance giant Winterthur, is one of the leading
providers of Sipps and is thought to be the only company offering the
self-invested option for FSAVCs.
The annual charges on the self-invested FSAVC include a plan fee of Pounds
150 and an administration fee of 0.5 per cent, capped at Pounds 400 for
larger funds. On top of this, you would pay the stockbroker fees (where
applicable) and the charges on any unit or investment trusts.
The investment choice under a self-invested AVC includes UK and overseas
equities, unit trusts and investment trusts, insurance company managed funds
and unit-linked funds. Some unit-linked funds offer performance guarantees
backed by derivatives but these are expensive.
Gordon is keen to try a UK equity tracker fund which invests in a range of
companies on the FTA All-Share index. Trackers often are used by
institutional pension funds because they offer broad diversification and a
performance that should match closely the index that is followed.
Andrew Warwick-Thompson, head of partnership pensions at actuarial
consultant Bacon &amp; Woodrow, says: 'Normally, index trackers offer very low
charges compared with actively-managed funds, but these cost savings are not
usually passed on to the individual investor through authorised unit
trusts.'
Authorised unit trust index-tracker funds are offered by several
institutions including Gartmore, James Capel, Morgan Grenfell, Legal &amp;
General, Royal Life and Norwich Union. Of these, only Gartmore's UK Index
fund offers low-cost entry for smaller investments. Its minimum is Pounds
2,500 and there is no initial charge, while the annual management charge is
0.5 per cent. Other trackers typically impose a 5 per cent initial charge
and an annual charge of 0.75 per cent.
Gartmore's fund invests in 450 companies across all sectors, making it one
of the cheapest and best-diversified UK equity funds for individual
investors in pensions.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Allowable deductions -
Briefcase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Before selling our second home, my husband transferred the property into our
joint names as tenants-in-common. On our separate returns, we intend
submitting identical capital gains tax calculations.
Also, as the property was bought more than 15 years ago, we propose using
the 1982 valuation (plus indexation up to the date of sale) as the cost,
divided equally between us. Is this procedure correct?
Are the solicitors' costs and the land registration charge incurred in the
transfer, as well as those involved in the ultimate disposal, allowable as
deductable expenses?
And would an improvement to the property, such as the cost of installing
patio doors, be considered an allowable expense?
The procedure you have in mind is not strictly correct, although it is
likely to produce answers which are fairly near the ones which the law
prescribes. Your solicitors will guide you through the CGT labyrinth.
Yes, the costs of conveyance and registration are deductible and so are
those of ascertaining the March 31 1982 value and of improvements to the
property (except, say, for any improvements which were destroyed by later
alterations).

answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Mistake over Pep form -
Briefcase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the 1991-92 tax year, I sold 2xPounds 3000 shares in Legal and General
and transferred the proceeds into personal equity plans for myself and my
wife. She completed the correct single-company application form but I
completed a general Pep form by mistake.
Despite appeals, and its agreement that I did not intend to breach the
rules, the Inland Revenue's Pep unit has declared my Pep invalid because I
already held a general Pep for 1991-92. Is this correct?
No explicit provision for discretion is needed; the relevant powers and duty
to exercise discretion in such cases are bestowed and imposed upon the
authorities by the Inland Revenue Regulation Act 1890.
It is clear from section 114 of the Taxes Management Act 1970 that the
Revenue must give effect to the common intent and understanding of any
document, submitted by a subject or other taxpayer, which is intended to
have effect under any provision of the taxes acts from the consequences of
similar types of mistake etc. (except where a particular provision contains
explicit words along the lines of section 114 itself).
If, by chance, the Pep unit still fails to act reasonably in the
circumstances, ask for the free leaflet 'How to Complain About the Inland
Revenue'. You might also wish to write to your member of parliament so that
the matter can be raised in the House if need be.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Wife is liable for IHT -
Briefcase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My wife is a US citizen, aged 62. On January 1 this year, the Inland Revenue
recognised her as being domiciled in the US but resident in the UK, where we
have lived permanently since 1971. How does she stand over inheritance tax?
We suspect the Revenue's recognition of her US domicile is for general law
purposes, which would then apply to income tax and capital gains tax. But if
she has been resident in the UK for not less than 17 of the 20 years of
assessment, ending with the year of assessment in which the 'relevant time'
falls, then she will be deemed to be domiciled in the UK for IHT purposes.
Her world-wide assets would then be potentially liable to IHT on her death.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): When charities pay -
Briefcase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have been been asked to help in raising funds for the benefit of my local
church and we will be arranging a number of functions for which admission
will be charged. One event, also involving admission charges, is going to be
organised by people not connected with the church. What are the VAT
consequences?
The views of the Customs and Excise are set out in VAT leaflet 701/1/92 and
we suggest you get a copy. In any case, we suggest you take independent
professional advice before starting your fund-raising.
If a charity carries on a business, it must be registered for VAT if its
turnover exceeds the limits for registration. It could help for a charity to
be registered even if its turnover is less than the registration limit. The
potential advantage is the recovery of input tax on charges which it incurs.
One activity which is always treated as a business is charging for admission
to premises. There is, however, a VAT exemption for 'one-off' fund-raising
events. The detailed rules are set out in the leaflet.
The VAT consequences of the funds raised by the other organisation may be
more difficult to determine. If it is acting as the church's agent, then its
activities will be treated as being carried on by the church and normal VAT
rules will follow. If not, then the organisation itself will have to pay VAT
if its turnover is high enough.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): What is an AVC?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An additional voluntary contribution (AVC) is a company pension arrangement
set up by the employer to run in conjunction with the main scheme. It allows
members to top up their benefits to the maximum permitted by the Inland
Revenue.
For most members, the maximum pension is two-thirds of their final salary
(but see below for higher earners).
Employees can pay up to 15 per cent of annual salary into company pensions
but most schemes require members to contribute about 5 per cent. This leaves
up to 10 per cent to invest in AVCs.
Where the scheme is non-contributory - that is, funded solely by the
employer - employees can invest the full 15 per cent in AVCs.
Some employees' pension contributions and benefits are restricted by the
'pensions cap', which was introduced in the 1989 Budget.
This restricts the amount of salary on which pension contributions can be
based to Pounds 76,800 for the 1994-95 tax year (Pounds 78,600 in 1995-96).
In the present tax year, capped scheme members can pay a maximum of Pounds
11,520 (15 per cent of Pounds 76,800) to their company scheme and AVC
combined, while the maximum pension that can be taken is Pounds 50,690
(two-thirds of Pounds 76,800).
Most company AVCs are run by life offices and building societies and the
investment choice can be very limited.
Free-standing AVCs (FSAVCs) are similar to company AVCs but the employee has
an individual contract with the provider. They offer a wider investment
choice but the employee bears all the charges, unlike company AVCs where the
employer shares this burden.
AVCs and FSAVCs offer tax relief on contributions, tax-free roll-up of the
fund and, for those who started AVC contributions before April 1987, the
possibility of tax-free cash.
The fund is used at retirement to buy an annuity which provides a regular
income for life.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Permanent interest-bearing shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pibs are the closest you can get to holding ordinary shares in a
building society. They are fixed interest securities with no redemption
date - so your capital cannot be guaranteed. You can realise your
investment only by selling them on the open market - with the chance of
capital gain or loss. They provide a relatively high yield, as the
table shows. This is partly because a building society is theoretically
not obliged to pay out if doing so would drive it into loss. Also, the
market is relatively small and the shares are not always easy to buy
and sell.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Gilt issues - best value v tax status
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Your capital gain on a gilt - a UK government bond - is tax free.
However, you pay tax on the interest. Therefore, gilts which deliver a
higher proportion of their total return as capital gain are more tax
efficient, and - other things being equal - more attractive to
higher rate taxpayers.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Fashion: Party dresses for the smart young things - Avril
Groom on what the under-sixes are wearing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The entertainment is about to begin. The girls are twirling and preening,
checking out each other's velvet and lace. The boys are already loosening
their bow ties and blaming mummy for forcing them into tight-buttoned
shirts.
This is not a corporate Christmas dinner but a smart tots' party in a
Kensington townhouse. This is the domain of the competitive pre-prep school
mother. The duels that start with fur coats at dawn outside the school gates
can too easily escalate with the festive season into full-scale party wars.
The end may be providing ever-more magical experiences for innocent children
but the means sometimes run into extremely conspicuous displays of
consumption.
At some parties the children, seated formally round tables, are waited on by
the hostess's staff. The latest wheeze is the 'limo party', where a number
of dressed-up little girls pile into a stretch limousine and are driven
round town watching videos and taking in attractions such as a museum or a
burger restaurant. If the party is held at home a huge fantasy cake, costing
perhaps Pounds 400 and which no one will eat, is the centrepiece. An
entertainer is de rigueur, aided and abetted at this time of year by both
Santa Claus and costumed 'characters'.
The usual form is for the children to arrive with their nannies, who are
offered champagne; and for mothers to make an appearance at the end in order
to thank the hostess. Country parties follow a similar, if more low-key,
pattern - the cake may be made by a family retainer rather than Jane Asher
and a glass of wine next to the Aga tends to replace the champagne and white
shag pile.
In either case there are, according to one veteran of such rituals, two
factions - the modernists and the traditionalists. This means, broadly, that
the 'characters' and the contents of the essential party bags will be
inspired by Disney or Beatrix Potter respectively.
One aspect, however, is common to all. Dress is always traditional and
nostalgic, involving yards of net petticoat for girls and white shirts and
breeches or long shorts for boys. The only difference is in the amount of
glitz. South west London leans towards plain velvet or smocking whereas the
capital's northern suburbs favour gilt buttons and lace-ruffles. Similar
styles appear at children's parties in Paris, Milan and New York because
what is perceived as the traditional British look has become the universal
standard of special occasion children's clothes.
Its origins lie in media portrayals of royal children, whose formal style
has scarcely changed for generations. Andre Durand's recent portrait of
Princes William and Harry in T-shirts and trainers, however ridiculed by the
art establishment, was probably a more sartorially accurate portrayal of
what goes on in most homes but the public perception of aristocratic
children in party wear and smocked frocks has brought considerable
commercial success to the original purveyors of such items.
The White House, in New Bond Street, London, specialises in hand-finished
clothes which are almost children's couture and numbers tourists, arrivistes
and indulgent grandmothers among its customers, along with the greatest
families in the land. These are clothes which largely aim to please the
giver or the parent rather than the children, who rarely appreciate the
finer points of exquisite fabrics and perfect execution. Slightly simpler,
but also geared to an export market with an insatiable appetite for British
tradition, are clothes from Burberry, Daks Simpson and Scotch House.
British mothers are more inclined to shop at department stores or small,
upmarket shops such as Young England owned by former royal nanny Barbara
Barnes. Trotters, owned by Sock Shop founder Sophie Mirman, Patrizia Wigan,
Bonpoint or the small Jacadi chain. The latter two are of French origin and
their neat-collared, small-check dresses and shirts and Tyrolean-style knits
show that in children's, as in adults' fashion, the European version of le
style anglais is often more chic than the home-grown variety. Emporio
Armani, Ralph Lauren and The Gap are other stylish imports.
As fashionable children's names filter through society, so do their clothing
styles, so that today party frocks and formal jackets pack the rails of
chain stores alongside the denim and the sweatshirts. Laura Ashley's
redefined 'British Heritage' image has been highly successful in their
Mother and Child departments and the style has found an echo at Marks and
Spencer, Next, BhS and - for children up to five years - Boots.
Yet the lavish party is - like most aspects of childhood - just a phase,
whose passing is a source of either regret or relief to parents. Boys lose
interest first, both in dressing up and in behaving with decorum.
Barnes says she stocks little for boys over six 'because their mothers
cannot persuade them out of sweatshirts and tracksuits'.
At around the age of eight, girls go from fairy princesses to grunge queens,
seemingly overnight. Then you are into the wasteland of black denim and Dr
Martens, from which, with luck adolescents emerge into black tie and evening
frocks around 15.
My son, aged 12, recently received his first invitation to a pre-teen ball.
But he and his friends decided to pass on a grown-up, late night out because
the card suggested ties might be worn. Life may currently be cheaper but the
wistful nostalgia evoked by wide-eyed tots in pretty party gear cannot be
denied.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Income): Convertibles with Pep
 -Gillian O'Connor explains the finer points of an investment that needs
careful planning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Budget changes are likely to allow investors to include many UK
convertibles in their general personal equity plans after April 6 next year.
Convertibles are riskier and more complicated than most other
non-convertible bonds, and income investors should hold them in a
well-spread portfolio.
Many people will find it easier to buy them through a suitable unit or
investment trust Pep. Some may want to buy a few individual convertibles to
bump up the yield in a self-select Pep. Expert advice is probably essential.
What is a convertible?
It is a corporate loan stock or preference share which pays a fixed annual
income and can also be exchanged for a pre-set number of ordinary shares of
the same company at certain dates over a certain period.
What is the difference between convertible loan stocks and convertible
preference shares?
Not much in practice. The main theoretical difference is that loan stock is
part of a company's debt, not its capital, and has an earlier claim on the
company's assets if it runs into trouble; preference shares are part of a
company's capital and rank before the ordinary shares for dividend payments
and for capital repayment.
If a company is short of cash it might well skip a preference payment and
hope to make good the omission when it can afford to; not paying interest on
a loan stock brings a company into default and is not done lightly. Most
convertibles have a pre-set repayment date.
One difference that confuses many people is that the nominal annual dividend
rate (coupon) on a preference share usually is quoted net of standard rate
tax, whereas the coupon on loan stocks is quoted gross. So, if you pay tax
at standard rate, your net income from an 8 per cent preference stock will
be the same as from a 10 per cent loan stock. Just to add to the
complications, some convertible prefs quote a dividend in pence per share
rather than as a percentage.
Note: some convertibles are preference shares - but not all preference
shares are convertibles. Other preference shares are valued much like the
comparable fixed interest securities.
How do you work out your annual income?
Ask your broker or look up the gross yield in the FT. Then net it down for
your own tax rate if appropriate.
Why buy convertibles?
Two reasons. Some people are interested mainly in the income, others in the
total eventual return. Different convertibles appeal to the two different
buyers.
How does the yield compare with that of fixed-interest stocks and shares?
It is normally somewhere in between. A few convertibles offer yields as high
as fixed interest stocks. They may suit income investors but are unlikely to
be worth exchanging for shares for a very long time.
How do movements in the market price of the convertible relate to those of
the underlying shares?
Convertibles are less volatile. Theory says that the higher the yield on the
convertible, the more it behaves like a gilt and the less it responds to
movements in the underlying shares. Those with lower yields follow the
underlying share price more closely and appeal to equity investors worried
about a sharp market fall.
Theory does not always work in practice, though. High-yielding convertibles
sometimes behave more like high-yielding shares than gilts. When markets are
turbulent, convertible prices can be slow to adjust.
How does the capital growth in convertibles compare with that of the
underlying shares?
It depends on the period you are looking at, what is happening to the
market, and if you include re-invested income. Over the past six years,
convertibles have outstripped the underlying shares if you assume gross
income is re-invested, but done slightly worse with no income re-invested.
They have done best when the market as a whole is rising.
On a shorter time scale, convertibles tend to rise less rapidly than shares
in a rising market, and fall less sharply in a falling one.
How does conversion work?
Take the British Aerospace convertible prefs. These can be converted on May
31 any year until 2007. Terms are 11.976 ordinary shares in BAe for every
100 convertible prefs. Otherwise, you are repaid at Pounds 100 in between
2007 and 2010. Conversion will provide the same capital sum only if the
ordinary share price is at least 835p when you convert: that is known as the
conversion price.
BAe ordinary shares were 420p midweek and the convertibles 106p. At 106p,
the convertible gets you into the shares at 885p (Pounds 106 / 11.976 =
885p) which represents a conversion premium of 111 per cent over the 420p
share price.
If the ordinary share price trebles to 1260p by 2007, the preference shares
would be convertible into ordinary shares worth 151p, and investors would
not want to be repaid at 100p.
When should you convert?
Ask your broker. There are two points to consider.
Income: if the company is successful, the income on the ordinary shares will
have risen over the years, whereas that on the convertible is fixed.
Normally, you should convert when the income on the shares into which you
can convert looks set to exceed that on the convertible: the crossover
point.
Capital: never convert when there is a large conversion premium. Sell if you
must.
What happens if the company gets a takeover bid?
Check the small print. The take-over panel insists that holders of
convertibles should be offered at least as much as they would get if they
had converted into shares. But there is no longer a rule that a bidder has
to offer fair recompense for the conversion premium.
What if you do not convert?
There are some horror stories of private investors losing a third of their
investment overnight because they failed to convert before their conversion
rights expired.

FT  17 DEC 94 / How to Spend It: Perfect gifts for difficult people - Lucia
van der Post conjures up an imaginary family to offer ideas for presents for
real relatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Families, families . . . console yourself, everybody else's are difficult,
too. But, as Tolstoy might have said, it is the difficult ones that are the
most interesting. But no matter how difficult they may seem, somewhere there
is a present to match. Here is an archetypally difficult family, and
presents to please them.
CHARLES: IN RECESSION
In the 1980s Charles' salary looked like a telephone number. But these days
life is tougher. The financial investment firm he worked for has gone under,
his losses at Lloyd's still loom and Charles spends his days helping to put
some financial order into his wife's catering business.
He does not often have to wear a suit so anything from somewhere like Racing
Green (0345-331177) would help restore his fading wardrobe or, better still,
a pair of stone-coloured cords or moleskin trousers from Hackett or Johnnie
Boden (081-964 2662). A Thomas Pink shirt would go down well, too, for those
days when he has to face the bank manager.
Now that Charles does not have to cut much of a figure in the office his
waistline has become rather slack. He would love a chin-up bar at just
Pounds 9.99 - tones up the biceps and the torso - from Lillywhites,
Piccadilly Circus, London W1.
Charles loves good things but can afford them less and less - he would be
thrilled by a finely-made Caran d'Ache pen - all slim lines with a good
strong pocket clip and a giant-sized refill for Pounds 99.50.
He badly needs cheering up so a real boys' own adventure would be just the
thing. Give him a day out learning to be a rally driver for Pounds 225.
(01608- 678339)
ZAC AND SKY: VERY, VERY GREEN
Zac and Sky are concerned about the third world, conservation,
over-population and waste. Zac is in computers and Sky is an occupational
therapist but hates it.
Sky sees herself as an earth mother but her concern about using up the
earth's resources means she only has one child. She is worried about her
Daisy sitting in front of screens all day, laying down cholesterol for her
later years.
Power Rangers In-Line skates ('the most happening way to work out') would be
good for eight-year-old Daisy. With a high ankle support, soft inner
linings, strong chassis and PVC wheels, they are just the thing and at
Pounds 19.99 a pair (from Toys 'R' Us) Daisy will find them 'awesome'.
Then Sky loves traditional games such as Triominos from Goliath Games. It
is, she has heard, the perfect family game. It encourages 'interactive play'
something Sky is very keen on. It won the Game of the Year in the
Netherlands and for just Pounds 9.99 ought to give a lot of bonding.
Daisy will certainly find an Urban Forestry Kit, Pounds 2.99 from Natural
Fact, 193 King's Road, London SW3 (mail order 071- 352 4283) in her
stocking. The kit consists of three seedlings to plant to help prevent
global warming.
Sky herself would love almost anything from Natural Fact, 192 King's Road,
London SW3 - an ecru towelling robe at Pounds 49.99 or Acca Kappa natural
straw massage slippers at Pounds 30. As for beauty products (not that Sky
uses them much) Green Things, 70 Chalk Farm Road, London NW1 is the place.
Sky believes in fair trade and loves anything with an 'ethnic' label. Kashi
(294/5 High Holborn, London WC1), for instance, has hand-made papier-mache
decorations, children's wooden jig-saw puzzles at Pounds 6, and
silver-plated wine glasses from Pounds 4.50, all made by extremely poor
women in India.
JANET: STRESSED SINGLE MOTHER
Janet is in her late 30s, a media person with an independent TV company and,
as if that was not stressful enough, she is a single mother to
seven-year-old Simon. She is busy, busy, busy. She never has time to shop so
what she needs are presents to soften her home and things for herself.
Give Simon a PGL Adventure holiday weekend (Pounds 79 plus insurance
0989-764211). Simon would have a ball and Janet (dearly as she loves Simon)
would love a weekend to herself. She could indulge in all those new age
therapies she is so keen on. She would love a voucher for aromatherapy
(Aromatherapy Associates 071-731 8129, Pounds 38 a session) and she is
always worried that she never has time to pretty up the house so fresh
flowers arriving regularly would do wonders for her morale. For roughly
Pounds 150 Parterre (071-323 1623) would send a bunch of seasonal flowers
once a month for six months (delivery charges vary but in the London area
would be about Pounds 3).
Jewellery, if you get it right, is always a good present. A multi-stranded
pearl choker from Coleman Douglas Pearls, 97b Drayton Gardens, London SW10
(starting prices Pounds 380) or one of their huge pearl cuffs (from Pounds
480) would be wonderful. She has also had her eye on Sandra Cronan's
collection of faux jewellery at 18 Burlington Arcade, London W1 - in
particular her aquamarine collet necklace at Pounds 850.
Janet likes glam clothes - she is, after all in a visual business - so
anything from Browns, South Molton Street, London W1 would be appreciated.
She hankers for Mulberry's Chenille coat at Pounds 495 or a delicate devore
scarf by Camilla Ridley (small ones are Pounds 99 but the luscious
shawl-sized ones are Pounds 249 . . . find them at Harrods, Liberty's, Space
NK).
HENRY AND ROSE: NEED SPOILING
Rose, dear Rose, has spent the last 20 years looking after the four
children, tending the house, doing the flowers in the church on Sunday while
Henry has been tending his patients as a country GP. They are both
unaccustomed to spending on themselves - what with four lots of school fees
and their youngest son's surprising academic success (what was his Ph. D all
about? They never did quite get a handle on it) required years of parental
support, and then the grandchildren coming along, the Old Manor House is
looking a bit shabby . . . as are their wardrobes.
So Henry and Rose are easy . . . spoiling is what they need. Rose would love
a black cashmere tunic sweater which can be given a demure elegance by the
addition of heavy ivory silk detachable collars and cuffs (Pounds 265 from
Madeleine Hamilton, Chichester Rents, Chancery Lane, London WC2A 1EG and 94
Richmond Avenue, Islington, London N1 0LU. Mail order 071-833 3388). Or she
would love a heavy matt silk shirt with double cuffs (Pounds 75 from TM
Lewin, 103-106 Jermyn Street, London W1).
These days Rose has difficulty keeping track of her spectacles - so her
grandchildren might give her some pretty haematite beaded spectacle ropes to
hang them around her neck. At Pounds 19.99 a time (including p+p ) from
Crystal Eyes, 12 Bemish Road, London SW15 1DG (081-789 3528). If Henry is
feeling rich he could give her one of the beautiful antique lorgnettes or
opera glasses sold by Optika on the Lower Ground Floor at Harrods (not cheap
 -anything from Pounds 250 upwards - but very special).
As a girl Rose was a promising artist and now at last she has time to start
doing water-colours again - she would love the drawing pad holder,
beautifully encased in leather, by Papyrus (Pounds 97.50, 48 Fulham Road,
London SW3 6HH, 071- 584 8022) and if somebody is feeling generous there is
a paint brush tube with a waterproof lining that fits on to it with a strap
for Pounds 97.50.
Rose likes jewellery. Caroline Charles, 56/57 Beauchamp Place, London SW3
(071-225 3197) is her sort of shop and this winter it has marvellous
antique-looking diamante chokers and earrings as well as some dashing
leopard skin gloves which would wake up the sidesmen in the local church on
a Sunday morning.
Henry has seen too many of his patients slide into an unhealthy late middle
age so he is making determined efforts to take his shape in hand. A
precision-made marching compass with a luminous dial and a magnifying sight
lens at Pounds 14.95 (from Presents for Men, 01295-750100) would lend his
walks some interest. So, too, would a pedometer which clips to the waistband
and measures the distance covered, approximate number of steps taken and
calories consumed. By Sportsline at Lillywhites, Piccadilly Circus, London
W1, Pounds 19.99.
Henry loves single malt whisky or, at the end of one of Rose's splendid
diners, some cognac (get him an XO Cognac at Pounds 90). A classic from
Talking Books for when he is driving round the countryside would go down
well (make sure it is unabridged for Henry knows his classics), as would
some very fine tea.
NIGEL: DASHING IN ADVERTISING
Nigel is in his early 30s and really rather dashing (though not quite as
dashing as he would like to be). Much to the bewilderment of his masters at
school who remember him as rather lightweight Nigel is doing very well in
advertising.
Though Nigel has had a mobile for some time he is rather bored with the
bulge it makes in his Paul Smith suits - he would love the little Sony
('smaller than a pack of playing cards,' he read somewhere) mobile. He knows
it is expensive (anywhere between Pounds 200 and Pounds 400 depending on the
discounts) but it would be just the thing.
In the 1980s his bathroom was full of premium-priced lotions and potions but
now he is wary of glitzy names selling what he refers to as 'coloured water'
and goes for classic lines which he likes to think of as 'his': Chanel's
'Pour Monsieur', Givenchy's 'Gentlemen' or anything by Geo. F. Trumper are
the classics he likes.
In the 1980s he would spend hours watching American football but 1990s man
supports his local soccer team. So he would love a video of his favourite
club (Arsenal, Spurs, Chelsea . . . they are all doing them). He has
intellectual pretensions so a video of a French classic movie would please
him.
Nigel eats out rather less than once he did and is into cooking - lots of
pasta which satisfies his need to feel creative without taxing it too
severely. A proper Parmesan grater would go down well (Pounds 12.75), as
would a terracotta egg-tray for Pounds 6.75 and an espresso maker that goes
on top of the cooker with a ceramic pot on top around Pounds 20 or sweet
little aluminium knives at Pounds 3.95 to Pounds 4.95, just right for
spreading tapenade on his crostini. All from The Conran Shop, Michelin
House, Fulham Road, London SW3.
He is, of course, highly computer literate and would not move without his
laptop. But he is the first to admit that computers are not things of great
beauty. Mulberry understands him perfectly and has produced a laptop
computer case in brandy harness-leather with solid brass fittings which
would be just the job for Pounds 395.
SOPHIE: DADDY'S GIRL
Sophie has just turned 19 and is not what you might call academic. Her
A-levels, much to Daddy's displeasure were not up to much, so after her
secretarial course she took a nice little job in an art gallery. The salary
is poor but she likes the slight whiff of bohemian glamour attached to it
(after all Lady Helen Windsor did all right, didn't she?) and they do not
mind if your lunch-hours drift on a bit.
She would really like anything from Nicole Farhi (Chanel is, dare we say it,
just a little passe this Christmas) or APC (130 Draycott Avenue, London SW3)
and what she would like in particular is a silver tunic or leather-wrap
mini-skirt. Then she has her eye on an absolutely plain polo-neck wool body
from Donna Karan's DKNY range at Pounds 79, any accessory by Patrick Cox (8
Symons Street, London SW3).
She longs to own a Discman (about Pounds 200). Now that she has to be
tolerably organised for work she would like a black patent Bill Amberg
rucksack to hold her personal belongings (Pounds 70 from Harvey Nichols but
there is an excellent cheaper version at Debenhams for Pounds 35).
She has always longed for a silver jig-saw ring Pounds 144 from Georg
Jensen, 15 New Bond Street, London W1 or silver pen from Tiffany which would
fit into her Filofax (Pounds 34).

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): King coal's big test - Michael
Smith analyses the prospects of RJB Mining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since coal powered the British industrial revolution last century, the
sector and its workers have held a powerful grip on the public imagination.
This was shown as recently as two years ago by the extraordinary outcry that
greeted the government's plans to close 31 mines. But will the public now
back its apparent fondness for the industry with hard cash?
The question arises because RJB Mining has agreed to pay Pounds 815m for the
English mining assets of British Coal and is inviting the public to take a
stake.
Institutions already have taken up 125m shares being issued to provide
Pounds 400m of the money. But 15 per cent of these have been placed
conditionally by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the bank advising RJB, so that
private investors can have a chance to buy a slice of the industry.
They are, however, getting a range of contradictory advice because of the
controversy surrounding the bid.
The main charge by RJB's critics is that it has over-estimated seriously the
size of the market. Whereas RJB expects to be able to sell 34m tonnes a year
late in the 1990s, some of its rivals say a figure in the mid-20s is
optimistic.
Nor do they share RJB's view of the prices it can get. Indeed, some City
analysts believe RJB has got its figures so badly wrong that the company
will be struggling to make any money at all by the year 2000.
They also question whether RJB will, as it claims, be able by 1998 to pay
off much, if not all, of the Pounds 494m it is borrowing to make up the
total Pounds 894m that British Coal will cost.
On top of all this, the company has no guarantee yet of contracts with the
generators after 1998. If deals of the size and quality for which it hopes
do not materialise, and there is a debt overhang, then RJB could end up in
trouble.
Chief executive Richard Budge says the company's estimates for future
markets are, if anything, cautious. But he says that even targets were not
met, the company could cut down in size without incurring great costs. 'We
are much more flexible than people think,' he says. Budge is helped by the
approach he has taken to cost-cutting. His business plan assumes he must
reduce costs by only 3 per cent a year - and even his critics concede that
is extremely conservative.
But the bait for investors is the promise of substantial rewards if the
company does manage to achieve its targets. If, as RJB says, the acquired
business can make Pounds 120m pre-tax profit next year, then the new shares
are, at 320p, being issued on a prospective price/earnings ratio of 6.5.
The p/e is one of the main criteria by which shares are judged; the lower
the ratio, the cheaper the share. The stock market average is about 12,
allowing RJB to argue that its shares are cheap.
The yield on this year's forecast dividend is about 4.9 per cent against a
market average of 4.2 per cent.
RJB, however, is promising strong dividend growth, particularly after the
debt is paid off. If it makes its targeted pre-tax profit of Pounds 220m in
1999, it should be able to to fulfil its promise.
For investors, putting money into coal is not the safe bet of, say,
electricity. The power sector offers strong dividend growth, too - now more
than 20 per cent a year.
Thus, RJB investors must believe that it can offer an even higher growth
than electricity, particularly after 1998.
Institutional investors have been prepared to back Budge and there are bound
to be private investors who will follow suit. They should consider the
advice of an industry executive who knows Budge well and admires him.
'It's a bit like gambling on the 3.30 at Chepstow,' the executive says. 'My
own hunch is that he will pull it off; that he will achieve the targets he
has set. But I am not sure. He might end up flat on his face.
'I would certainly not be putting my mother's last money into it - but if I
had some spare cash, I might risk it.'
Investors have until 3pm on Tuesday to apply. An application form is
available on page 3 of Weekend Money and in other newspapers.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Big players join the power game -
Companies in the news / Booming recs could be targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even at the start of this extraordinary week for the 12 regional electrical
companies (recs), the sector's shareholders had plenty to which they could
look forward. First, there are generous interim dividends - between 15 and
47 per cent higher than last year - which the companies have been promising
in the present financial results season. They should arrive soon.
Then, there is the likely flotation next year of the National Grid, a move
which seems certain to lift further the value of the share prices of the
recs which own it. But all of this became relatively insignificant when, at
1.53 on Wednesday afternoon, the Swiss Bank Corporation said Trafalgar
House, the conglomerate it advises, was considering a takeover offer for
Northern Electric.
It was the confirmation the City wanted for theories that the sector was
ripe for significant structural change, through takeovers and mergers,
following the expiry on March 31 of the government's bid-blocking 'golden
share' in the recs.
Takeover fever took hold. Shares in all recs rose an average 5 per cent on
Wednesday alone and the 12 companies finished the week with a combined
market value of Pounds 17.3bn. That compares with Pounds 5.2bn when they
were floated just four years ago.
But any shareholder tempted to take profits by selling is likely to be told
by his financial advisers to think long and hard. Many analysts have felt
that the first bid for any of the companies would flush out other potential
suitors, whether for Northern or its peers - and that could do nothing but
boost share prices.
Indeed, if Trafalgar does decide to bid for Northern - and all the signs are
that it will - then it will have to pay a large premium, even on yesterday's
bid-related Northern share price of 985p, to ensure victory.
It is true that Trafalgar's unusual circumstances provide it with more
reason that most to bid for a rec. Over the past three years, it has lost
nearly Pounds 400m before tax. The losses, and unrelieved advance
corporation tax, could shelter a large part of Northern's profits from the
Inland Revenue.
In addition, a bid could enable Hongkong Land - the property arm of Jardine
Matheson which owns 25 per cent of Trafalgar - to channel money from Hong
Kong into the UK and increase its stake in Trafalgar.
Trafalgar is unlikely to be the only company eyeing the recs and the results
season will have whetted appetites further. Aided by what is regarded widely
as a slack regulatory regime, imposed at privatisation, the companies have
increased underlying profits in the half-year by at least 20 per cent in
most cases.
From April, though, a tougher regulatory regime will force them to cut
prices in the distribution businesses - their main profit-earners - by
between 11 and 17 per cent, and there will be real reductions of about 2 per
cent in future years. This will stop profit growth next year for some recs,
but the upward path is likely to resume in 1996-97.
Most of the companies are cash-rich and, in spite of the regulatory changes,
will continue to generate more during the next five years. This has enabled
them to buy back shares or announce large one-off dividends, as Yorkshire
Electricity did yesterday.
Indeed, such are their resources that many analysts believe all of them will
be able to increase dividends by 8 per cent real a year until the end of the
century.
The other main attraction of the recs, both for investors and potential
predators, is their holding in the National Grid. Given to the companies by
the government at privatisation four years ago, the Grid is now worth more
than Pounds 4bn.
The recs plan to float it on the stock exchange next May or June, almost
certainly by a de-merger through which shareholders would be issued with new
shares in the Grid.
Many analysts think the Grid's full value is not reflected fully even at
yesterday's inflated share prices. Nigel Hawkins, utilities specialist at
Hoare Govett, says all rec shares are trading at discounts to their true
value when the Grid is included. He believes there is upside of at least
Pounds 1 in Norweb, London and Swalec.
Kevin Lapwood, of Smith New Court, says the whole sector is a buy with
Swalec, London, East Midlands and Norweb among his favourites. He cites the
Grid value as a factor but is also impressed by the prospects opened up by
the potential Trafalgar bid. 'The recs have no option now but to get value
out to the shareholders,' he says. 'They were already cutting costs, but now
they have to work to someone else's agenda.'
Some stockbrokers are more cautious. 'The dividend growth might be strong
but that is because companies are winding down cover from earnings, not
because profit prospects are good,' said one, who believes also that
sentiment will change as an election nears. A Labour government would almost
certainly tighten regulation of utilities.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (C of E Sums): Where the Church spends its
money - Andrew Adonis examines the state of Anglican finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The financial crisis confronting the Church of England is of classic
Micawberish dimensions: rising spending and too little income. In 1992, the
Church cost about Pounds 600m a year to run, of which nearly half was taken
up by the stipends, housing and pensions of its 20,000 serving and retired
clergy. A further Pounds 200m went on worship and buildings. The C of E has
16,300 buildings, 400 of them listed grade 1.
The cost of pensions and retirement housing subsidy grew at nearly three
times the rate of inflation between 1981 and 1991 - from Pounds 18m to
Pounds 58m a year. The number of clergy pensioners rose by nearly a quarter
due to longevity and a sharp rise in early retirements.
The pensions bill will continue to rise far faster than inflation and
investment returns. Pensions are linked to earnings, not prices, and the
demographic profile of the clergy peaks late in the 50s. A large proportion
of women priests, and women set to be ordained, are in their 50s.
The C of E's central funding agency is the Church Commissioners, a statutory
body established in 1948 and responsible to parliament. The commissioners
amalgamated the assets - mostly farms and property ground rents, some dating
back to Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries - from two former
bodies. The cost of clergy pensions is met entirely by the commissioners,
who also have had to meet rising demands for the rest of the Church's work.
Their contributions to clergy stipends and housing subsidies rose from
Pounds 26m to Pounds 66m in the 1980s, and its grants to cathedrals from
Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 3.8m. The commissioners also have to pay compensation
to clergy resigning because of the ordination of women - estimated at well
over Pounds 11m.
The commissioners do not have the income to continue like this. Misguided
property investments late in the 1980s depleted their asset base (now Pounds
2.4bn, down from a peak of more than Pounds 3bn in 1989), and actuaries
advise that they are over-distributing income if the assets are to be
protected.
One report suggests that the commissioners need to draw about Pounds 20m a
year less in income than the Pounds 161m they drew in 1992 - yet, meeting
future pension liabilities requires an extra Pounds 30m a year on top of
that figure.
The commissioners cover more than a quarter of the Church's outgoings. Most
of the rest comes from the 13,000 parishes; in 1992, they raised two-thirds
of the C of E's income (Pounds 372m). Of 1.1m regular Church-goers, 400,000
gave covenants totalling Pounds 87m, raising Pounds 114m after the tax
refund (up, in constant prices, from about Pounds 27m in 1964); a further
Pounds 212m was raised through collections and other giving, and Pounds 40m
from parish investments.
A lot of the money raised in parishes is passed up to the 44 dioceses, which
are responsible - together with the commissioners - for paying and housing
the clergy. The dioceses, which have little money of their own, try to
equalise the burden on parishes by taking account of relative wealth and
size. Various measures are used. In Chelmsford - which stretches from the
edge of Suffolk, across London's commuter-land and into inner-city Newham -
census returns are the tool. Levies range from Pounds 16,000 for an inner
London parish with a congregation of 100, to Pounds 115,000 in a well-heeled
parish in the Basildon area with a congregation of 400.
Dioceses and cathedrals have their own endowments and trusts, raising Pounds
50m in 1992. They are distributed, unequally, between the old wealthy (such
as Oxford and Winchester) and the new poor (like Truro and Chelmsford).
Were the 'funding gap' of Pounds 50m to be met by the parishes, the
proportion of the C of E's budget raised locally would rise to about 75 per
cent, further changing the balance of financial power within the Church away
from the centre and towards the parishes.

FT  17 DEC 94 / How to Spend It: A simple guide to buying a computer - What
sort do I need? How much will it cost? What does all the jargon mean? Paul
Taylor has the PC answers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forget mountain bikes, hi-fis and designer outfits; a personal computer is
second only to a foreign holiday on wish lists in Britain this Christmas,
according to a survey.
The Gallup survey, conducted on behalf of Intel, the US semiconductor
manufacturer, reveals that those who most want a PC are aged between 35 and
44, and the majority live in London and the south-east.
'We have seen phenomenal growth in the home PC market this year,' says Nick
Wood, marketing manager for Intel in the UK. 'The PC is vying for attention
with the television as a ubiquitous tool for the entire family.'
Sales of home PCs are buoyant on both sides of the Atlantic. In the US,
where 7m home computers will be sold this year, they have become one of the
hottest-selling consumer electronics items, outselling everything except
colour televisions.
The surge in home PC sales reflects tumbling prices and the success of
computer manufacturers in designing machines with something for everyone -
as the Intel survey confirms. Families with children between 11 and 15 years
old are much more likely to wish for a PC in their stocking.
Today's home PCs boast 'multimedia' features to run the latest games and
'edutainment', such as Microsoft's Encarta encyclopedia. But they also run
more traditional word-processing packages and home-finance software for
parents. Some can double up as a fax or telephone answering machine.
Once they are hooked up to a 'modem' and a telephone line, they provide
access to the information superhighway - the rapidly expanding world of
on-line services, electronic mail and the internet.
However, potential home PC purchasers still face a bewildering array of
machines, especially if they are not an expert. So here is a guide to buying
a family computer:
Question: Is this a good time to buy a family PC, or should I wait until
next year?
Answer: It is never an ideal time to buy because technology is advancing all
the time and prices will continue to fall. But the factors to consider
include the new types of PC which are coming shortly (some, for example,
will combine features such as television), new software, and the falling
prices for the latest generation of faster PC chips including the Pentium
and the rival PowerPc.
Q: I think I want to buy, but how much is this going to cost me?
A: The price range is from about Pounds 800 for a basic machine built around
an entry-level Intel 486 chip, up to Pounds 2,000 or more for a
top-of-the-range PC with a state-of-the-art Pentium processor. Remember, in
Britain most PC prices in computer magazines exclude VAT.
Q: Please explain in simple language what are the most fundamental choices I
have to make between equipment.
A: The most basic choice is which software operating system to choose -
Apple or Microsoft/IBM compatible. Generally, Apple machines still have a
reputation for being 'easier to use'. But thanks to Microsoft's Windows and
'plug-and-play PCs' from Compaq and other manufacturers, IBM-compatible PCs
are catching up fast.
There is a much greater range of software available for IBM compatible PCs.
And add-ons, such as a modem or extra memory, tend to be easier to find and
cheaper.
For children, a decisive factor may be which system is compatible with those
at school - although many primary schools have older computers which cannot
be used with either Apples or IBM-compatibles. For parents, if they intend
to use the machine to work at home, they will want one that runs the same
software as the machines in the office.
Q: So what sort of machine do I need?
A: The next important decision is how sophisticated a machine to buy. It is
possible to buy a basic PC, which just runs conventional software, or a
multimedia machine, which will also run software stored on CD-Rom discs
which are similar to audio CDs and are capable of storing a vast amount of
digital information.
Multimedia machines will probably also have a special soundcard inside and
two external speakers which are needed to provide high quality sound. Many
will also come bundled with some 'free' software and some will have 15in or
even 17in colour screens rather than the standard 14in variety.
A multimedia PC will cost about Pounds 200-Pounds 300 more than a basic
machine. It should be possible to buy a basic PC from a good quality
manufacturer for less than Pounds 1,000 and a similar multimedia machine for
around Pounds 1,200.
Q: Are there any other big technical decisions?
A: Unfortunately, several. One with expensive implications is whether the
machine's central processing unit - brains - contains an Intel 486 chip (or
a similar chip from a different manufacturer), or a faster one such as
Intel's Pentium or the rival PowerPc chip that has been developed by
Motorola, Apple and IBM.
The 486 - which itself comes in several speeds ranging from a relatively
slow SX/25 up to the fastest DX4/100 - allows you to run almost all the
family software that is available now. But machines based on Pentium/PowerPc
chips may be more use in future as software is developed which makes better
use of their extra power.
The choice also depends on how much money you have to spend, how big the
price difference is, and how long you plan to keep the machine - in a year
or 18 months 486s will probably look old-fashioned.
But most important, what is the PC going to be used for? If it will mainly
be used for simple word processing and standard games then a 486  - say an
SX33 or preferably a DX2/66 - will be OK. Apart from high-powered graphics
and a few other processor-hogging functions, there is not much that a 486
cannot handle adequately.
If your children insist that they need to keep up with the latest games 18
months hence, if you plan to develop an interest in rocket science, or if
you explore the outer reaches of the Internet, then it might be worth
digging a little deeper into your pocket and getting a Pentium or a PowerPc.
In general, it is best to buy the highest performance machine that you can
afford. This prolongs the useful life of the machine and may stop you
kicking yourself in six months. If you decide to go for a Pentium they too
come in several types. The 'slowest' Pentium processor runs at 60MHz - but
is still a bit faster than a DX4/100 486. The most recently introduced
Pentiums run at 75MHz and the fastest (so far) run at 90MHz.
In terms of cost, a quality P60 machine can be bought today for less than
Pounds 1,500, a P75 will cost about Pounds 100 more than that and a P90 an
additional Pounds 100. From a home user's point of view any Pentium-based
machine will be fine, but if only the fastest will do, then go for the P90.
If you think of a mid-range 486 as a solid dependable family saloon car,
then a P60 is a BMW and the P90 a Porsche.
Q: Can I buy a 486 now and upgrade it to a Pentium machine later?
A: Yes and no. Most slower 486 machines can be quite easily upgraded to a
faster 486 chip using one of Intel's 'overdrive' processors. In addition
some machines, which are labelled as such, should be upgradable to a
long-promised Pentium-style overdrive processor called the P24T.
However, beware. Upgrading to a Pentium-style chip can cause problems. Intel
has a system for 'qualifying' systems as upgradable, so look out for that in
product specifications. Generally, it is much easier and cheaper in the long
term, to buy a more powerful machine to start with than to upgrade a slower
one later.
Q: I've heard of things called hard disks and 'Ram'. What are they?
A: Just as important as the processor, if not more so, are the other bits
and pieces which go into a computer.
As almost every PC-owner will confirm, a huge hard disk-drive, capable of
storing loads of programs and data, plus lots of internal memory or 'Ram',
which also helps speed up processes, are both vital.
The old rule with both hard disks and Ram was take the current 'standard'
amount and double it. Generally that rule still holds true.
Software packages are getting more hungry for power and space. Therefore it
is useful to have a hard drive of at least 500MB for software yet to be
developed. Lots of machines only have 200-300MB.
Similarly, many PCs come with just 4MB of Ram - which is just about
sufficient to run the latest heavy-duty software programs such as
Microsoft's Office Suite, but you really should go for at least 8MB.
This amount of Ram speeds up current applications dramatically, and will be
essential for the next generation of software including Windows 95, which
Microsoft is due to launch by June next year and which will boast a number
of important and desirable extra features over the current Windows 3.1
version.
Q: What about multimedia machines?
A: The most important thing here is to ensure that the machine at least
meets the latest Multimedia PC industry- standard dubbed MPCII which lays
down a set of minimum requirements.
In particular, make sure it has a double or even triple-speed CD-Rom drive
because this is what is required by the latest games and multimedia
encyclopedias that contain video-clips, and it must me able to read PhotoCD
discs.
Q: What about picture quality?
A: This depends on two main factors, the internal graphics card and the
external screen or monitor.
The graphics card, which generates the screen image, must be a capable of
generating at least 65,536 colours and of supporting screen resolutions of
1280 x 1024. A card labelled '64-bit' is a good bet for a multimedia
machine.
Generally the graphics card should have at least 1MB of its own video Ram
(Vram) memory and ideally it should be possible to add to this Vram later.
This will ensure that the graphics card is capable of keeping up with the
latest software.
On an ordinary PC, as opposed to a multimedia machine, a slower graphics
card capable of reproducing fewer colours is acceptable. But multimedia
machines and ordinary PCs both need a high quality SVGA or better colour
monitor. For your eyesight's sake, also make sure the monitor has a
flicker-free image refresh rate of at least 72Mhz.
Q: And sound?
A: The sound quality from a PC's tiny internal speaker is usually pretty
poor. A multimedia machine should have a 16-bit internal sound card which
guarantees audio-CD sound quality. It should also have connections for
external speakers and a games joy-stick.
A set of headphones with adjustable volume are a must if you do not want to
listen to children playing on the computer all the time.
Q: If I get all this gear, can I dial up on-line services, cruise the
information superhighway and access this internet thing I have heard about?
A: No. You need two more things: a modem, which enables a computer to send
and receive information over an ordinary telephone line. Get at least a
14,400-baud modem - this speed is rapidly becoming the main standard.
Fax-modems will also allow you to send and receive facsimile messages.
Then you also need the right communications software to dial up and log into
on-line services. Windows comes with a basic communications program called
Terminal.
For more information on gaining access to on-line services, see Paul
Taylor's feature on Page III.
Q: What about home PC brands?
A: Unless you really know your stuff, it is best to stick to well-known
brands with strong warranties, telephone helplines and service plans for
when things go wrong. Among the well established brands are Apple, Compaq,
Dell and IBM. Others include Gateway 2000, Packard Bell, Viglen and Elonex
in the UK.
Q: Should I buy from big high street retailers, computer superstores or from
mail-order firms, such as Dell?
A: It is a good idea to look around first. Buy a copy of one of the big
computer magazines such as PC Plus or Personal Computer World then go and
have a look in Dixons or one of the other high street retailers or one of
the big PC superstores such as PC World or Byte, if there is one near you.
If you know what you want, buying from a well-established mail-order company
that advertises in one of large PC magazines can be the cheapest and easiest
way. Make sure you get an order number and a delivery date, then pay by
credit card.
However many people feel more comfortable buying from a retailer or
superstore. The big advantage is that you can see what you are buying and
should be able to try it out.
PC superstores have a wider range of machines and should be willing to
configure the computer to your requirements.
A high street store may be more convenient, but do not rely on the sales
staff knowing what they are talking about. If you have a friend who knows
about computers take them along too.
Q: Do I need to worry about the software?
A: Yes. All home PCs come with operating software already loaded on to the
machine's hard disk, and many brand-name PCs now come with additional free
bundled software such as Microsoft Works, so you can just plug the PC in and
play.
With some machines you will have to load the software yourself which can be
tricky and time consuming - especially on Christmas Day.
Most multimedia machines are sold with some games software and CD-Roms
included in the price. Beware though, the games are not usually particularly
hot ones.
You may also want to consider what extra software you want to buy, so the
novelty of the machine does not wear off on Christmas morning. For older
children, popular games include 7th Guest, Myst and Sim City 2000, but there
are thousands of software and CD-Rom titles.
Ask friends with PCs what software they like, or read some of the reviews in
the popular PC magazines.
Q: What about a printer?
A: You will probably find a printer extremely useful. These are usually made
by a different group of manufacturers. The most important considerations
here are what the printer will be mostly used for, the type of printer and
the price.
If children will be using the printer a lot, consider buying a colour
printer. Colour ink-jet printers can now be bought for around Pounds 350.
If colour is not important, then a good low-cost option is a standard inkjet
printer from an established manufacturer such as Hewlett-Packard, Canon,
Epson or Olivetti. These cost around Pounds 200. Dot matrix printers are
cheaper but cannot produce such good print.
For the highest print quality pick a laser. Recent price cuts and technical
innovations mean some laser printers designed for use with windows software
now cost Pounds 300 or less. Good quality manufacturers with low cost models
include NEC, Panasonic, Star and Oki.
Q: What if the machine malfunctions?
A: Branded PCs are generally sold with a one-year warranty. Check the
details. Often they are back-to-base warranties, which means the PC
manufacturer will fix the machine if it goes wrong, but the purchaser has to
get it back to the factory or the shop.
Some manufacturers (and shops) offer extended warranties. But these tend to
be expensive and it is worth noting that most computers that go wrong do so
in the first year - which is covered by the basic warranty.
Q: Is that it, then?
A: Yes, happy computing.

FT  17 DEC 94 / How to Spend It: In the tiniest box - Lucia van der Post on
the most thoughtful of gifts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is there a woman in the world who would not be pleased by the tiniest of
boxes, carefully packaged, nestling at the bottom of the tree, and offering
up the most intimate, sweetest, most thoughtful of presents - a piece of
jewellery?
Here is the run-down on just some of the options around this Christmas.
Infinitely desirable and wearable by almost everybody except the most
avant-garde and determinedly modern, is Sandra Cronan's collection of faux
jewels and gems - here are beautifully simple necklaces of aquamarines (one
gorgeous one at Pounds 850, others at Pounds 3,500, or earrings Pounds 650)
or an Edwardian faux diamond and pearl choker (Pounds 1,800) as well as an
early 20th century steel and gilt metal cross at Pounds 140 or a late 19th
century Vauxhall glass star brooch at Pounds 170. All available from her
shop at 18 Burlington Arcade, London W1 (tel: 071-495 4103).
La Boutique Fantastique is another small gem of a shop at 13 The Royal
Arcade, Old Bond Street, Mayfair, London W1 (tel: 071-409 2641) which is
owned by Irina Laski who has a dramatic onyx and coral necklace with a
centrepiece of 18 carat gold plated on a silver shield and heart at Pounds
350. Matching ear-rings are Pounds 215. She also has some beautiful Venetian
milk-glass jewellery ranging from Pounds 160-Pounds 230.
Cox &amp; Power is a new little jewellery shop at 95 Walton Street, London SW3
2HP (tel: 071-589 6335) with a rather continental approach to jewellery -
that is, it produces jewellery to be worn at all times (so many of their
pieces could be worn during the day) and ranging in price from Pounds 45 for
a pair of hand-made silver and 18 carat gold earrings to Pounds 1,950 for a
platinum set sapphire ring or scattered diamond ring. Designs are
understated. Kiki McDonough at 77c Walton Street, London SW3 (tel: 071-581
1777) has a knack of producing jewellery which chimes in beautifully with
the lives of the modern working woman - not too grand for everyday wear yet
glamorous enough to add a bit of panache to a plain dark suit. Her new gold
and sterling silver collection (very useful because it means it can be
teamed with either gold or silver pieces) is a perfect example of the genre
 -chunky square gold and silver earrings are Pounds 295, a chain necklace is
Pounds 725. Lesley Craze Gallery 34 Clerkenwell Green, London EC1R (Tel:
071-608 0393) is the gallery for those who like their jewellery to speak
more of their sense of design and modernism than their means. This does not
mean to say it is bleak or austere - most of the pieces combine a great deal
of charm with real wearability. This Christmas, for instance, there are some
charming dog brooches and necklaces in patinated silver by Carol Mather from
Pounds 94, or lustrous bronze, copper and gold ceramic earrings by Linda
Jolly for around Pounds 10 and - most desirable of all - Esther Ward's
platinum caterpillar necklace for Pounds 1,027.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MONDAY: Last October, East Midlands Electricity announced it was to give
back Pounds 186m to shareholders as a special dividend, or 85p per share. It
chose this route rather than buying back shares. The interim dividend might,
therefore, be less generous than those of other regional electricity
companies; nonetheless, at least 15 per cent is expected.
TUESDAY: Eurotherm, the industrial process control equipment supplier, has
performed well in recent years by cutting costs and improving productivity.
Confirmation that order book strength has been translated into higher sales
could come when the company reports its results for the 12 months to October
31. These should show pre-tax profits up from Pounds 20.1m to about Pounds
26m.
TUESDAY: Wessex Water, one of the smallest but best- regarded, of the 10 big
privatised water and sewerage groups in England and Wales, should report a
profits rise of more than 10 per cent to Pounds 58m-Pounds 60m (Pounds
53.4m) pre-tax. The dividend is forecast to go up by a similar margin to
4.5p (4p). Regulatory and pricing issues apart, investors will be waiting
for a progress report on the company's waste management joint venture with
the UK arm of WMX, the US-based world leader in the field.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Bids
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales were put on bid
alert on Wednesday when Trafalgar House announced it was considering an
offer for Northern Electric. If it goes ahead analysts expect mergers and
takeovers involving other companies.
The government made clear that it will not allow a bid to be complete before
March 31 when its bid-blocking 'golden share' in each of the recs expires.
Trafalgar is still considering its options but it seems likely to go ahead
with a bid, probably in the New Year.
Northern's shares reached 1010p at one stage last week, valuing the company
at Pounds 1.25bn. Trafalgar, attracted to Northern's steady stream of
earnings, will probably have to pay considerably more than that to win what
is certain to be a contested takeover battle.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Directors' dealings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONALD, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Traditionally Christmas is a period of good cheer in the City when the
market rallies, writes Vivien MacDonald of The Inside Track.
The absence of such a rally this year may make some people despondent, but
the number of directors beginning to buy shares again should offer a glimmer
of good spirits.
In the past, increasing numbers of directors buying has presaged a rise in
the market.
Better news is filtering in from the US where the bears are slightly in
retreat and the bulls are coming back. This would be genuinely good news for
the market though its impact may not come through till the new year.
Filofax, the company that supplies specialised stationery, has featured
several times in this column over the past year as directors have bought
large quantities of stock. The sale by Robert Collischon, the chairman, of
20,008 shares at 223p still leave him with over 1.76m shares.
The shares have performed well over the past year, recording an
out-performance of some 43 per cent relative to the market.
Williams Holdings is a group with diverse interests - ranging from homes and
garden through to specialist engineering. The shares have been performing
steadily. Earlier this year the company had a rights issue and the recent
sale made by AN Rudd was in order to fund the rights he took up at that
point.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): UK retailing - Pick of Lex / A
selection of comments from this week's FT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The combination of warm weather, two budgets and a rise in interest rates is
not auspicious for UK retailers, especially in the vital trading weeks
leading up to Christmas. No wonder that the de-rating endured by the sector
over the past year has accelerated, with stores' shares underperforming the
market recently.
Is the gloom overdone? To the extent that it is caused by fears about
Christmas trading, the answer is probably yes. There is plenty of time left
for a last-minute shopping spree. If retailers can hold their nerve and
resist the temptation to slash prices, there is no reason for this December
to be unseasonally dire
Longer term worries abound, though. Not least, there is the fear that the
retail environment has deteriorated now that inflation has dropped.
Double-digit growth in revenues becomes difficult to achieve even when
volume growth is at respectable single-figure levels.
The signs, however, are that the sector's strongest companies, with high
market shares and up-to-date information technology, are coping well. They
are generating plentiful cash. Moreover, earnings growth could even beat
that of the market as a whole next year. Yet, the sector, excluding Marks
and Spencer, has shed its traditional premium rating. Weaker retailers have
been punished by investors over the past year. By contrast, a re-rating of
the stronger companies is overdue. Shareholders could find some good
yuletide value in the sector.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Albright &amp; Wilson - Pick of Lex /
A selection of comments from this week's FT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With profits of chemicals companies rising sharply, Tenneco may have chosen
a good time to float its Albright &amp; Wilson subsidiary. The company, which
could fetch Pounds 600m, has re-structured its operations, is arguably a
low-cost producer, and supplies chemicals to the likes of Coca-Cola and
Colgate toothpaste. That said, investors' enthusiasm should be tempered.
For a start, they should ask why Tenneco has chosen to float Albright
instead of selling to a trade buyer - an option it has sought for at least a
decade. The main reason is that the US conglomerate thinks it will receive a
better price from a float. But potential investors will wonder why they
should pay more than trade buyers are willing to put up.
Thinking about the longer term in the notoriously cyclical chemicals
industry is sobering. Albright faces questions about one of its most
important products - washing powder phosphates, which are banned in many
countries. By its own admission, it is also squeezed between much larger
suppliers and customers. None of this means that Albright will not thrive as
an independent entity; merely that the price must reflect the risks.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Asda - Pick of Lex / A selection
of comments from this week's FT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Asda's shares have outperformed the market by 34 per cent so far this year,
the best performance of any FTSE 100 stock after British Steel and GKN, and
better than all the food retailers except Morrison. Thursday's sparkling
figures show why.
Asda is enjoying a renaissance which has brought it back from the brink.
Like-for-like sales growth rose 7.1 per cent in the first half, far better
than other superstores and a considerable achievement in a competitive
market.
The performance reflects a full-scale revamp of Asda'a offering, as well as
price-cutting. The latter led to an 0.5 per cent fall in gross margins,
significantly worse than at competitors such as J. Sainsbury or Tesco. This,
however, was more than offset by a combination of greater productivity and
increased sales volumes. The result is that operating profits at the Asda
stores rose at more than twice the rate of sales growth.
The muted market reaction to Thursday's numbers reflects some disquiet about
Asda's falling depreciation charge. But the real issue is whether Asda is
becoming just another well-run food retailer, rather than a recovery story.
Its three-year restructuring programme comes to an end next summer.
Thereafter, earnings growth will slow. In the meantime, investors'
preferences are likely to shift to the dull performers in the sector - for
example, Sainsbury.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Electric shock - Pick of Lex / A
selection of comments from this week's FT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar House has sent a shock through the electricity sector. At the
minimum, news that it may bid for Northern Electric will force all 12
regional electricity companies to pay greater attention to shareholder
value. The move could also trigger consolidation of the industry.
Northern is vulnerable because it has done relatively little to cut costs.
So, a more aggressive management may be able to squeeze greater value from
its assets. But whether Northern falls will depend on how much Trafalgar is
prepared to pay. Shareholders are unlikely to be interested in an offer of
less than Pounds 8 a share in cash, plus whatever net proceeds Northern
receives from demerging its stake in the National Grid - worth perhaps a
further Pounds 2 a share. The precise value depends on how one rates the
risk of an incoming Labour government imposing a windfall profits tax.
Northern's best defence will be to improve earnings per share by gearing up
its balance sheet through large dividends or share buy-backs. With a stable
monopoly franchise, the company could manage gearing of over 50 per cent.
Although Northern has already bought back 10 per cent of its equity, it is
still ungeared.
The alternative defence - seeking a white knight - could be futile. Other
companies, notably Scottish Power, are thought to have looked at Northern.
But why would they become embroiled in a bidding war with Trafalgar when
they have 11 other recs to choose from?
Such thinking points to copycat bids or mergers rather than counter-bids.
For bidders outside the industry, the logic of buying a rec would be that
they could manage it better - unless, like Trafalgar, they can also use up
tax losses. For other electricity companies, the logic is different: merging
two recs could eliminate duplication in head offices, customer services and
billing systems. That could save up to Pounds 50m a year, although not all
the benefits would go to shareholders. The industry's regulator has said
that customers must receive their cut.
While intra-rec mergers could make sense, it would be a mistake if they were
embarked on for defensive reasons. Shareholders would not be pleased if two
fearful recs joined forces as a way of avoiding tough decisions on
cost-cutting. It would be better to remain independent, cut costs, and gear
up balance sheets.

Research Machines, the educational computer group, this week managed to
avert the attentions of computing services group Misys and unveiled a
placing price of 175p a share for its forthcoming flotation.
The price valued the group at Pounds 29.5m - some Pounds 10m below the
valuation put on by Misys' 235p per share approach made the previous week.
After being rebuffed by the RM board, Misys made a second proposal to
acquire a 29.9 per cent stake at a price of at least 210p a share. This was
also rejected by RM.
The float will raise just Pounds 200,000 net for the company. The listing is
being instigated ostensibly to enhance the company's profile.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Perspectives: Learner drivers on the superhighway - In part
two of a series, Paul Taylor tells how beginners can sign on to on-line
computer information services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Armed with a personal computer and a modem, the world of on-line information
is just a telephone line and a mouse click away.
Once on the 'information superhighway' the possibilities are almost
limitless. From weather forecasts to astro physics, there are few subjects
not covered on the internet or in what has become known as 'cyberspace'.
The internet itself is an informal system linking more than 7,500 individual
computer networks and more than 2m computers in academic institutions,
companies and other organisations.
It is used mostly for electronic mail (e-mail) and information exchange by
an estimated 25m to 30m people - a figure rising by between 5 and 10 per
cent a month.
But the internet is not the only source of on-line information. There are
thousands of bulletin board systems (BBS) mostly run by computer
enthusiasts, and a wide range of commercial on-line information services.
So how does the novice begin to explore this world?
The traditional route has been the local BBS - an electronic notice board on
which messages can be left. Most BBS's also enable users to send (upload) or
receive (download) software and other data.
A BBS is run by 'sysops' (systems operators), who are usually computer
enthusiasts to help 'newbies' - newcomers to the world of PC communications.
BBS telephone access numbers - the numbers used by communications software
to connect a home PC modem to the BBS modem - are often listed in computer
magazines.
Most on-line systems, although not CompuServe, expect your communications
software to be set to the following parameters: eight bits, no parity, one
stop (or 8,N,1) and support a number of different 'protocols' or modem
communications languages, for downloading computer files. Among the most
common protocols are Xmodem, Zmodem, Ymodem and Kermit.
Usually there is no charge - other than ordinary telephone charges - for
logging on to an amateur BBS. There are, however, also a growing number of
commercial BBS, most of which advertise in magazines, which charge for
downloading programs (and sometimes pornographic pictures), or can only be
reached via premium-priced telephone numbers.
Although it is reasonably easy to set up communications software and a modem
to dial into a BBS, many new users may find it easier to start with one of
the commercial information services such as CompuServe Information Service
(CIS) or Delphi, or a commercial conferencing system such as the Computer
Information eXchange (CIX).
Although most of these services started in the US they are now available via
a local call in the UK. Their big advantage over the neighbourhood BBS is
that they have helpful telephone 'hotlines' ready to talk new users through
their first tentative steps along the information superhighway.
These services generally charge a join-up fee and then a flat monthly
membership fee of between Pounds 6 and Pounds 10. However, in an effort to
sign up new customers, they often waive the sign-up fee and offer potential
users free trials.
To sign up with CompuServe call 0800-289378 or log on to 0171-490 8881 by
modem with the parameters set to 7,1,E; for CIX call 0181-390 8446 or log on
to 0181-390 1255 with the parameters set to 8,N,1; for Delphi call 0171-757
7080.
New customers usually receive membership kits which, in addition to a local
access telephone number and a password - needed to log on to their master
computer - usually include a manual and, in the case of CompuServe, a
dedicated software package called Cim (CompuServe Information Manager),
which is available in DOS, Windows and Macintosh versions.
Although initial charges are low, it is easy to build up a sizeable bill
quite quickly. Commercial on-line services generally charge a flat monthly
fee, and an additional fee for information outside their basic services,
plus, in the UK at least, the PC user will have to pay telephone call
charges.
To reduce costs, most commercial on-line services give customers local
numbers which can be used to access their services.
There are also special software packages called off-line readers, or OLRs,
that enable you to prepare before the communications software connects to
the service and the meter starts ticking. Using an OLR such as NavCis for
CompuServe or Ameol and WigWam for CIX, a one-hour session can be reduced to
a few minutes on-line.
Commercial on-line services also provide one of the simplest methods of
connecting to, and sampling the internet. For example CIX, CompuServe and
Delphi allow their subscribers to send and receive e-mail to and from other
internet addresses. They also provide access to Usenet newsgroups - there
are around 10,000 Usenet 'discussion groups' on the internet. And CIX and
Delphi provide access to a special IP (Internet Protocol) prompt.
This means users can search for files on remote computers and upload or
download files from other computers connected to the internet using file
transfer protocol (ftp) via the on-line service.
At present however, the commercial on-line services in Britain stop short of
providing 'full' internet access. In particular they do not provide access
to one of the most exciting areas of the internet - the World-Wide Web.
Since its creation in 1992 the World-Wide Web has become the fastest-growing
internet service, with more than 3,000 Web sites and tens of thousands of
documents published by academic institutions, companies and governments.
But to access the Web, the fledgling cybernaut needs a direct internet
connection - available from a specialised telecommunications company, called
an internet service provider. Direct internet access also involves running a
communications program called a TCP/IP stack (the internet's networking
protocol) and setting up for full direct access to the Internet can be
tricky.
Fortunately, however, internet service providers have begun to provide
software - or make it available for downloading. For many new users this may
be a key factor in choosing a service provider.

software

FT  17 DEC 94 / Perspectives: Fallacies that can be fatal in medical matters
 -Barry Groves challenges the research technique of meta-analysis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY GROVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the Weekend FT of November 26, Clive Cookson described recent uses of
meta-analysis in medical research. ('New conclusions from old studies').
This is a reader's response.
You are an ambitious medical researcher. You are working in a controversial
field - say, the effect of diet on heart disease. A number of clinical
trials have been published, but with conflicting findings: some show a small
but significant benefit, others demonstrate small but significant harm,
while most have results which are statistically insignificant.
Despite the large amounts of money and resources which have been devoted to
the studies, no convincing evidence is shown and no conclusion can be
reached. How can you make a name for yourself?
The greater the numbers of subjects and the greater the time-span, the
greater is the chance of achieving a statistically significant result. So
what you might do is to collate all the data from those studies and pool
them into one large study with the hope that significance can be shown and
the question resolved. It is a technique called meta-analysis.
Meta-analysis has become the modern way to demonstrate significance where
none appears to exist. But it is a technique beset with problems.
There have been about 40 studies of heart disease, for example, but their
methodology and endpoint have not been similar.
Some have looked only at dietary factors, while others have linked diet with
other 'risk factors': smoking and obesity. Some have cholesterol-lowering as
their goal, others count the numbers of fatal coronary events or add
non-fatal coronary events, and a few look at all-cause mortality. Pooling
them all could give a statistician nightmares.
Even if they were similar, however, such meta-analyses involve what is known
as the 'faggot fallacy'. Lash together a number of sticks, each weak by
itself, and you will have a bundle (faggot) which is much stronger.
In a similar manner, scientists bundle together studies, each weak or
insignificant by itself, in the hope that the resulting bundle will be
stronger. But it is a technique that should be regarded with extreme
caution.
It is only valid if the individual studies were valid, and you can be sure
that if it takes large numbers of subjects to show a significant benefit,
then the real benefit for any individual must be relatively unimportant.
The benefit to the individual is an important consideration which is often
forgotten.
Scientists are tempted to equate statistical significance with clinical
importance. But 'statistical significance' is only a measure of the
probability that a treatment will be of benefit; it does not measure the
magnitude of that benefit.
And where large numbers of subjects are needed merely to show a small
probability of benefit from a treatment, then the treatment itself is likely
to be of no real benefit to the patient.
In the search for an answer to the 'diseases of civilisation', time is the
scientists' enemy. Heart disease usually takes decades and cancers several
years to reach a point where symptoms become noticeable. Any trial,
therefore, has to be conducted for decades if it is to demonstrate a
significant effect. But most scientists cannot wait that long and so another
fallacy is introduced.
That is where a surrogate is substituted for the real endpoint. For example,
breast cancer screening is hailed as a success because of the
ever-increasing number of women being screened. The number of women
screened, however, is merely a surrogate for what should be the real
determinant of whether screening is beneficial: a drop in the number of
deaths from breast cancer.
Unfortunately, despite the 'success' of screening, the number of deaths from
breast cancer is still rising.
Another fallacy that creeps covertly into much of modern-day thinking on
disease management concerns the extrapolation of findings from studies: the
belief that if something is good for you, then 10 times as much must be 10
times as good.
Some studies have shown that a small amount of alcohol may be protective
against heart disease, but that does not mean that the heavy drinker will be
healthier than the teetotaller. Most things, even water, which are
beneficial in the right quantities, can be dangerous when taken to excess.
In this case, we have a further question: is it the alcohol that is the
beneficial agent? Or could it be that the type of person who drinks a couple
of glasses of wine during the week has a temperament which is beneficial?
Whenever the results of clinical or epidemiological studies are considered,
whether singly or pooled together, someone can be guaranteed to remark that
if this or that had been done sooner, many lives would have been saved.
This brings me to my last fallacy: that of cheating death. The health
fanatics would have us believe that we are members of an immortal species.
It is with regret that I have to inform them that we are not. No matter how
we alter our lifestyles, we will not get out of this existence alive.
Much of the medical research over the past 40 years has attempted to prove
that a change of diet away from fats will reduce the incidence of premature
heart disease and prolong our lives. But individual studies have
consistently failed to demonstrate convincing evidence of this, and
meta-analyses of them have not been much more successful.
That is not surprising: all the increases in heart disease deaths over the
past three decades have been in the over-seventies. Premature deaths from
the disease started to fall in Britain from about 1965. At that time we had
a high-fat diet, ate fried breakfasts and 'went to work on an egg'.
Meta-analyses of studies which start from an incorrect premise are no more
useful than the studies they analyse.
To find the right answers, you first have to ask the right questions.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Perspectives: Six years waiting for a flight - John Ridding
explains why one man has made his home at Charles de Gaulle airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With his bags neatly piled on a luggage trolley, Merhan Karimi Nasseri
appears just like any other passenger at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris.
Reading a newspaper alongside a fellow traveller, he might be waiting for a
flight to take him home for Christmas to New York, Brussels or Moscow.
But Nasseri is not like the throng of businessmen and tourists milling
around the airport terminal. While others, if they are unlucky, may face
delays of several hours before boarding their aircraft, Nasseri has been
awaiting his departure for more than six years.
His desired destination is London. But his last attempt to fly there, in
November 1988, met with failure. Without a passport, he was ordered to
return to Paris. The French authorities, however, refuse to grant him
citizenship. As a result, he has made Charles de Gaulle his home, becoming
the world's hardiest transit passenger in an unfortunate episode in the
annals of immigration.
As Nasseri tells it, his tale is one of mishaps, misfortune and red tape.
Expelled from Iran in 1977, following charges of anti-Shah activities he
applied for refugee status in several European countries. In 1981 the UN
High Commission for Refugees in Brussels granted his request for political
asylum. He was furnished with papers allowing him to travel within countries
which have signed the Geneva convention on human rights and apply for
citizenship.
In 1988, however, after several abortive attempts to enter Britain, he lost
his refugee certificate at the Paris Gare du Nord railway station.
Undeterred, he sought once more to travel to London on a British Airways
flight. Without his travel documents, however, he was returned to Paris.
What followed was a series of skirmishes with the French authorities.
Nasseri was arrested three times for illegal entry into France and detained
for brief spells in prisons in the Boulougne and Bobigny suburbs of Paris.
Without a country of residence, however, he could not be deported. So he
returned to Charles de Gaulle.
In 1992, Christian Bourget, a well-known refugee lawyer took up Nasseri's
case, successfully appealing against the verdict of illegal entry. 'The
courts accepted that he had been granted refugee status in Belgium,' says
Bourget. 'So the police leave him alone at Charles de Gaulle. They know
there is no point in hauling him in.'
The problem is that Bourget has met with less success in his dealings with
the French immigration authorities. 'The administration refuses to give him
citizenship or to supply him with the documents he needs to leave France,'
says the lawyer. Nasseri wields an identification certificate which reads:
'nationality - to be determined'.
His applications to enter Britain have also made little headway. From a file
among his bags he produces a letter from the consular section of the British
embassy in Brussels. 'Although I sympathise with you in your present
predicament there is unfortunately nothing this office can do . . . I wonder
whether the Belgian authorities can help you in this matter,' the letter
reads.
But officials in France, Belgium and London reject Nasseri's complaints. The
UNHCR in Paris claims Nasseri could claim new documents from Brussels, which
originally accepted his refugee status, or could gain access to duplicates
of the documents. They say Nasseri is able to leave the airport but has
decided not to, a claim which wins some support from Philippe Bargain,
airport medical officer.
'I have offered to drive him to Brussels to try and sort things out, but he
doesn't want to go,' says Bargain. 'He has found a cocoon at the airport. So
he remains stationary in a place of transit.'
Bourget says, however, that Nasseri remains in the airport because he is
safe there. 'The police at the airport know him. If he travels into Paris he
might get stopped and asked for his papers, which of course he doesn't
have.'
Nasseri says he will leave once he is able to travel to Britain. His
attachment, he says, stems from a period of study at Bradford University in
the 1970s and his birth in Soleiman, a part of Iran which was under British
jurisdiction when Nasseri was born there in 1945. He wants to return to
study and will wait, he says, as long as it takes. 'It could be months, it
could be years. But I am optimistic.'
In the meantime, he continues with his bizarre airport life. Meticulous and
well kempt, he uses the airport facilities and travel packs from passengers
for washing and trimming his Chaplinesque moustache. He sleeps on a bench
between a Burger King and a cafeteria in the basement level of the
futuristic Charles de Gaulle building.
Despite his unworldly predicament, Nasseri is well abreast of the news. He
keeps informed through a tiny radio supplied by Japan Air Lines and is an
avid reader of the press. Today he is concerned by the prospects of
ratification of the Gatt treaty on international trade and by events in
Bosnia. 'After what has happened I doubt my course in Yugoslav studies still
exists,' he says, referring to his stint at Bradford.
For food, he receives meal tickets from airline staff or sympathetic
passengers. Many write to him, care of the boutique basement area of
terminal one, and the letters are kept in a file in one of his suitcases. A
card delivered that day from Switzerland came with SFr10. It is addressed to
Alfred, a name attributed by a court clerk, and by which he is commonly
known.
What he misses most is 'delicious food' and Marks and Spencer. 'I used to
buy my clothes from there in London. I don't care much for airport clothes.'
As for Christmas, he is waiting to see what turns up. 'Once I had Christmas
dinner in the medical centre. Another time I was given champagne by British
Airways,' he says, leafing through his diary. Behind him, the airport
speakers announce a flight to London Heathrow. But he has heard it many
times before.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (High-Risk Investment): Trusts take the plunge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors are likely to have a choice of venture capital trusts as soon as
these high-risk funds come into existence next year, writes Bethan Hutton.
While full details of the rules governing them have not been published -
they will form part of the Finance Bill early in January - two fund
management groups have announced plans to go ahead.
The chancellor had barely sat down after last month's Budget before
Rothschild Asset Management said it would set up a venture capital trust,
specialising in the food industry, as soon as possible. Now, Glasgow-based
Murray Johnstone aims to establish a more general venture capital trust
within the first six months of next year.
Venture capital trusts will take stakes in very small companies, most of
which must have assets of less than Pounds 10m. Murray Johnstone aims to
reduce the cost of investing in such tiny companies by co-investing with
other venture capitalists.
Private investors are to be offered substantial tax breaks for investing in
the new funds at launch. These include 20 per cent up-front income tax
relief on investments of up to Pounds 100,000 a year, and tax-free income
and capital gains from the trust if shares are held for at least five years.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (High-Risk Investment): Can warrants arrest
their dive in '95? - Capital shares have done a little better. In both
cases, Bethan Hutton finds optimism over the longer term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Warrants and capital shares are rather like Longfellow's little girl: when
they are good they are very, very good - but when they are bad, they are
horrid.
If you put a small amount of money into these investments, you stand a
chance of multiplying your original stake several times over - and much more
rapidly than if you put the same amount into ordinary shares. But you are
also much more likely to lose everything.
Warrants and capital shares are both highly-geared investments which tend to
magnify the ups and downs of the market.
WARRANTS give the holder the right to buy a particular share at a set price
on a given date or dates. A warrant's worth depends on the time period
before it expires and how close its exercise price is to the actual share
price.
When markets are going up and the share price shows signs of shooting well
above the warrant's exercise price, the warrant price will take off. But if
the share price is falling, the warrant normally will fall two or three
times as fast.
Warrants are issued most commonly by investment trusts, but some normal
companies also have them.
CAPITAL SHARES are found in split-capital investment trusts. This class of
share usually has no fixed share of the profits when the trust winds up;
instead, it gets whatever is left over when the other classes of share -
zero dividend preference shares, income shares etc - have taken their due.
If the markets have been favourable and the trust has grown strongly, then
the capital shares will make fat profits. But if the market has slumped,
their pickings will be lean.
Stock markets have not had a good year in 1994 - at least, not since the
beginning of February. So, investors in warrants and capital shares mostly
have seen the value of their investments fall.
You might expect them to have fallen much more dramatically than the
underlying markets. But, as always, things are never quite that simple.
Andrew McHattie, publisher of the newsletter Warrants Alert, says: 'With the
market being off about 12 per cent, one would expect warrants to be down
about 35 per cent. The average warrant is probably down about 25 per cent,
but the average obviously disguises a lot of variable performances.'
Likewise, capital shares have not done as badly as you might have expected.
'Capital share prices have, on average, proved to be remarkably resilient in
1994,' says Peter Walls, investment trust analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing.
The average capital share price is down 9.6 per cent since the start of the
year, while the FT-SE-A All-Share index is down 11.65 per cent.
Nigel Sidebottom, who manages portfolios of investment trusts at stockbroker
Gerrard Vivian Gray, adds: 'The feeling might be that a geared investment
like a capital share would have done worse than that. But the outcome is
very mixed - there is tremendous variation.
'The best-performing stock in the investment trust sector was Mezzanine
Capital, which rose by 24 per cent (between January 31 and December 8). At
the other end of the scale, the worst-performing investment trust share was
Scottish National capital, which fell by 50 per cent. Capital shares were at
the top and bottom of the list.'
Variation in warrant performance was just as extreme. The graphs show one of
the best performing warrants (Yorkshire Tyne Tees Television, up more than
500 per cent between January 5 and December 13) and one of the worst
(Thornton Asia Emerging Markets investment trust warrants, down almost 80
per cent over the same period).
Careful selection is, therefore, crucial: the underlying investment, level
of gearing, premium or discount level and general market conditions all need
to be taken into account.
Colin McLean, of Scottish Value Management, is in charge of the Warrants and
Value investment trust. He tends to pick short-life warrants issued by
companies.
'Warrants which are in companies rather than investment trusts have tended
to be more volatile,' he explains, 'but they can offer better value.'
The portfolio of warrants recommended by McHattie's newsletter this year is
down an average 0.98 per cent over the year. But 14 of the 26 stocks made
losses, several of more than 40 per cent. The portfolio is redeemed by one
warrant, British Biotech. This was tipped in May at 43p and has climbed 188
per cent to 124p.
This is not an area to be recommended for novices, widows, the elderly, or
those of a nervous disposition. But, strangely enough, orphans - or people
investing for children or grandchildren - are less likely to be warned off
capital shares and warrants.
The reason is that while the short-term ups and downs can be the investment
equivalent of a white-knuckle ride, they can offer higher growth than many
other investments over the long term.
Unfortunately, some people ventured into the market this year who probably
should have stayed away. McHattie says: 'It has been a typical private
investor sob story in many respects, because the market had just enjoyed a
fantastic period - 1993 was a year of exceptional gains, where the average
warrant tripled in value.'
Naturally, this was noticed. 'We had a surge of private investors coming
into the market at the start of the year. They did very well in the first
three months, but then it all went very sour.'
McHattie does hold out some hope. 'My view is that warrant investors may
expect a better performance in 1995. I am looking for average gains of 25
per cent from UK warrants in 1995, with many of the gains to come from Asian
trust warrants which fared badly this year.'
Sidebottom says some capital shares are attractive now, although not
necessarily those which have fallen furthest. For private investors, he
favours the less highly-geared trusts (such as M&amp;G Dual Capital) which have
held up better in poor market conditions, rather than very highly-geared
examples (like Scottish National) which have dropped right back and might be
thought cheap.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Take-over fever proves catching -
London / But retailers strike a sour note
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the few remaining hopes for a bit of stock market fizz before the end
of the year has been bid speculation, and this week has provided some
entertaining tests of whether words might actually turn into action.
They failed spectacularly to do so in the case of SG Warburg, the UK
investment bank with global ambitions, and Morgan Stanley, of the US. Merger
talks were called off on Thursday, a week after they became public.
Postmortem reports revealed that the sticking point was Mercury Asset
Management, Warburg's 75 per cent-owned fund management arm which
contributed nearly all the group's first-half profits.
The board of MAM wanted a premium offer for the minority shareholders, along
with guarantees about independence. The US firm would have contemplated the
former, up to a point, but jibbed at the latter.
The merger collapse left Warburg with difficult questions to answer about
its vaulting ambition to become a global investment bank. Its share price
fell 99p to 678p on the day.
The other big bid prospect of the week remains firmly on the cards, however.
Interest in Trafalgar House's putative offer for the Newcastle-based
Northern Electric is intense, especially as it would be the first hostile
bid for a privatised UK utility.
The engineering and property conglomerate is controlled effectively by
Hongkong Land - a subsidiary of Jardine Matheson, which is trying to reduce
its dependence on Hong Kong ahead of the 1997 hand-over to China.
Money from the colony, plus the target's own strong balance sheet and
cash-generative powers, would finance such a deal rather than Trafalgar's
other shareholders, whose goodwill has been strained by asset write-downs
and two rights issues since 1992.
At least Trafalgar House has returned to profit after three years of losses,
and gearing at the September 30 year-end had been cut to just 3 per cent on
shareholders' funds of Pounds 708.6m.
With the government saying it would retain its 'golden' shares in the
regional electricity companies until March 31, Northern's share price ended
the week at 985p (valuing the group at Pounds 1.22bn) after rising to 1010p
on Wednesday, the day Trafalgar said it was considering a bid.
Northern started the week at 881p - already nearly 300p above this year's
low. Then, a rising clamour about bids in the sector kept mentioning it as a
prime target. It is one of the smaller of the 12 recs, with a reputation for
lacklustre management - although some analysts have begun to revise that
view.
Takeover fever has added a few extra volts to a highly charged sector. The
recs' results season, which culminates on Monday with East Midlands, has
thrown up dividend rises of between 15 per cent and 47 per cent -
politically unpopular dimensions. Underlying earnings have risen strongly,
even if re-organisation charges - including hundreds of job losses - have
dented headline figures.
What a contrast with the retail sector, which ought to be enjoying its
jolliest time of the year. The latest CBI survey, showing stagnant sales in
November and October, confirmed that the 'feel-bad' factor was continuing to
affect consumers.
Ample evidence of high street gloom was provided by this week's set of
company announcements, most graphically in the profits warning from Hornby,
maker of the racing car game Scalextric. Its shares fell 50p to 127p on
Wednesday as one source was quoted as saying: 'It is going to be a poor
Christmas.'
On Thursday, Asda's chief executive, Archie Norman, came out with a
typically bleak forecast for the supermarket sector: the era of intense
competition and falling margins was likely to continue for another two
years. In spite of this, the group has continued its recovery, beating
market expectations with half-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 108.7m.
A ray of hope for the future was offered by one small multimedia company.
VideoLogic has signed what could prove to be a lucrative deal with NEC, of
Japan, to develop computer games with much more realistic 3D images. Never
mind the Scalextric: games now available only in arcades are set to enter
the home.
Rather quaintly, VideoLogic explained away its Pounds 3.7m interim losses by
saying that the business remained 'in development mode'. It had eschewed
short-term profits deliberately to keep up investment in research into the
multimedia breakthrough. And, believe it or not, the market's reaction was
anything but cynical: the shares rose 11 1/2 p to 51p on the day.
As the company results season starts to wind down, the discomfiture of some
high profile individuals has this week vied with the takeover excitement for
the front pages.
Maurice Saatchi, founder of the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising group, was
last night forced to stand down as its chairman following pressure from some
big shareholders. They were incensed by a proposal he should receive a
Pounds 5m option package - based on his old salary of Pounds 625,000 instead
of his new one of Pounds 200,000.
Yet, even Pounds 5m pales into insignificance beside the estimated Pounds
40m of personal debts owed by Robert Montague, chief executive of container
rental group Tiphook. Barclays Bank has joined Royal Bank of Scotland in
serving petitions for bankruptcy on him. The latter's action is due to be
heard on Thursday. Of the money owed to Royal Bank, some Pounds 8m is
secured on Montague's 1,300-acre estate in Oxfordshire. Another of the
lenders is Commerzbank, of Germany, which has about Pounds 7m secured on his
yacht.
If Montague is made bankrupt, he will no longer be able to sit on Tiphook's
board.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Perspectives: A haven for the dear and the departed - Letter
from Woking / Richard Donkin on the discreet charms of the Surrey
bourgeoisie, as viewed from a railway carriage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since a survey by the Reward Group, a firm of pay analysts, named
Woking as the most expensive town in the UK, I have found myself enduring
the odd nudge and wink from colleagues suggesting that I 'must have a bob or
two' to live there.
They make the common mistake of equating expense with wealth, their theory
being that if something is expensive you must be wealthy in order to buy it.
Expense and wealth, however, have rarely made a lasting relationship as
compatible bedfellows. Wealth and thrift are a better match, perhaps,
leaving expense to elope with stupidity.
Here, in Woking, are all the answers to those questions posed by economists
and politicians about the lack of any feelgood factor as the UK emerges from
recession. Here you can find genuine old-style Dickensian misery, as
householders, weighed down by mortgages, loans and school fees, make their
Micawber calculations, end in deficit, and pray that something will turn up.
Woking has one of the biggest colonies outside the capital of that
semi-troglodyte sub-species - the commuter. You see us in the twilight hours
at either end of the day flocking on to dirty trains to Waterloo station and
the City where we grub out our high five-figure and sometimes six-figure
salaries.
Pallid features, furrowed foreheads and greying temples are the hallmark of
unfettered slavery, resigned adherence to the worship of work as the only
source of keeping the head above water. What they so unconvincingly mask is
not so much worries over negative equity - most of the souls with that
particular torment have long since found their release in repossession - but
totality of equity tied into property which cannot be released without a
realignment in their domestic circumstances. They are not as wealthy as they
think they are. Deep down they know it and it is the cause of real
unhappiness.
Some find relief on the journey home from work. I was told of one commuting
pack, travelling together, who sit in the buffet car and religiously down a
whisky at every station from Waterloo that starts with the letter 'W'. After
Wimbledon, Walton-on-Thames, Weybridge and West Byfleet their cares have
disappeared. You have to admire the constitution of the one who passes
Woking and gets off at nearby Worplesdon.
Filing off the train with all the other commuters at Woking railway station
any evening of the working week, it would be easy to conclude from the
vacant, fatigued expressions that you had joined the ranks of the living
dead. It has not always been so. Woking's original pioneer settlers were
just plain dead.
To understand this point we must go back just over 150 years to the laying
of the London-to-Southampton railway line, which passed through Woking, at
that time no more than an agricultural community of neighbouring villages,
all smocks, straw and pantiles.
The railway arrived just at the point that London was struggling with a
chronic shortage of burial land. Two entrepreneurs, Sir Richard Broun and
Richard Sprye produced a plan for what they called the London Necropolis - a
400-acre city of the dead, designed to be the mother and father of all
cemeteries that would serve London's needs for years to come.
It needed a Parliamentary Bill to make it happen. The result was Brookwood
cemetery, then quaintly named the Glades of Remembrance, on the edge of what
became Woking town. They even built a branch line into the cemetery. Thus
the first commuters using Woking arrived on one-way tickets from London.
The hearse trains, with vans segregated according to class and religion,
used a specially built terminus in London. The train ran until it was
destroyed by the Luftwaffe during the second world war.
It was no coincidence that Britain's first public crematorium was also built
in the town at a time that burial was regarded as the only accepted form of
disposing of the dead. Burning was proscribed by the Church and untested in
law. Enthusiasts, however, formed the Cremation Society, which celebrated a
legal judgment in favour of the method by cremating one of its dearly
departed members, a Mrs Pickersgill, in Woking in 1885, the first legal
cremation in the UK if you do not count burnings at the stake.
Perhaps it was the same tranquil surroundings that appealed so much to the
recently bereaved that also attracted London's money-makers. Woking soon
found itself the buckle of the stockbroker belt as of one London's most
important satellite towns.
Every few years as London's belly bulged, the belt would loosen a notch to
take in embryonic commuters. More and more trains fed the City's voracious
appetite for office workers to the stage that they were pulling out of
Woking station with the frequency of a London underground train at the
height of the Lawson boom in the late 1980s.
Now, however, the buckle is very much tightening as families who bought
their houses at that time struggle to shake off the mood of austerity
resulting from by falling house prices. When prices rose, they went up
rapidly. When prices came down they slumped; nothing sudden, but on a slow
slide on a downward curve over the last four or five years.
On the estate where I live - a recent development - the houses are fetching
about Pounds 100,000 less today than the price asked by the builder when
they had just been erected.
Yet still people come here; attracted mostly by the easy commuting, perhaps,
and the proximity of London's two biggest airports - Heathrow and Gatwick.
Maybe, also, there is another attraction, something to do with the town's
plain ordinariness and anonymity.
This might explain Woking's other funereal connection. Not only is it noted
for its disposals after demise, it has also attracted notoriety in the
business of dispensing death.
First it was the Sicilian Mafia. Francesco Di Carlo, one of Sicily's top
Mafia bosses, lived here for a while with his two large German shepherd
dogs. But Woking could have been cosier for the Cosa Nostra. Di Carlo was
rumbled as the head of a Pounds 75m heroin smuggling ring and jailed in
1987; not the sort of character with whom you would want to engage in a
neighbourly dispute over the hedge trimmings.
Just when we thought it was safe to mow the lawn again, I was doing just
that in May when I heard the gunshot of what police later decided was a
Chechen mafia hitman as he murdered a housewife on her doorstep about two
estates away in an apparent case of mistaken identity.
Having recently erected a 'No dogs allowed' sign on our private estate, it
may be time to consider the addition of another declaring 'Mafia-free zone'.
So come to Woking if you want to witness the symptoms of our endemic
national depression. They say it is the most expensive town in the UK. There
are better places to live, for sure, but you must agree there are worse
places to die.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Novelty value - One man's quest
for stocking-fillers goes on all year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sid Templer says his rather unusual business is best described as 'a quest'.
It is a quest for what he calls 'barmy things' - so-called stocking-fillers
that sell all the year round - and this is the time of year when he begins
to know whether his more recent searches have been successful.
'It's looking very good, probably better than ever,' said Templer, 53, a
former teacher and founder, 21 years ago, of Tobar, the company he named
after his sons, Toby and Barnaby.
For most of the autumn the barns and outhouses standing on the 20 acres
surrounding his Elizabethan farmhouse in rural Norfolk have been full to
bursting. But now they are largely cleared of the vast stock of novelties,
knick-knacks, games and toys for the nine-to-nineties that Tobar sells.
Business is by no means complete for Christmas. 'Many of the 2,500 retail
outlets, including museums and some specialist toy shops we supply go on
ordering until December 23 for delivery on December 24,' said Templer.
'After 21 years in business we are able to supply goods so fast that the
shops have no need to carry vast stocks. They usually get orders from us
within 24 hours so they order very frequently and in effect use us as their
warehouse.'
After a week's break after Christmas 'the quest' will start all over again.
In 1995 it will take Templer and his son Toby, 25, who is a co-director, to
the US and Germany. Sid Templer is also planning to go seeking ideas in
India and Hong Kong.
Toby, who runs the wholesale side of the business, said: 'We buy from most
countries. This year we have added some letter beads from Germany, some
traditional games from India and some painted acrobat toys from Sri Lanka,
and also reintroduced the original sets of five hand-painted Russian wooden
dolls.
'We are currently evaluating some calico hammocks from El Salvador - our
first line from that country.'
Not everything is imported. A specialist publisher in Bury St Edmunds, 40
miles away, produces colourful, embossed Victorian and Edwardian party masks
that have been a successful line for 12 years. A local printer is
responsible for the toy theatres that are another of Tobar's most successful
paper lines.
The plastic goods come from many countries. They range from a new range of
clockwork tortoises to a barking bulldog, an indoor boomerang, and a hen
that lays eggs. Altogether the company sells more than 500 lines.
'Prices start at a few pence. You could buy one of each of many of our
500-or-so lines for less than Pounds 100,' said Toby.
The most expensive line is a children's terracotta-brick building kit at
Pounds 39.90. 'I discovered it in Spain this year,' said Templer. 'I had
owned a similar British-made kit myself as a boy in the 1950s, but had been
trying unsuccessfully to find one for the Tobar range ever since my sons
were small.'
Among the least expensive lines is the fish - a paper novelty that sells at
5p. Templer introduced it 20 years ago and it is still going strong. He
estimated that in the run-up to Christmas there were 100,000 fortune-telling
fish in the Tobar warehouse.
When pressed, Templer admits that his real skill is in what he calls
'developing and adapting old-fashioned ideas' and in selling them to
different markets. A good example was a Victorian paper butterfly novelty
which he 'rediscovered' three years ago and sold as The Magic Moth. With a
little help from Templer, it metamorphosed a year later to become The
Balancing Butterfly. These now sell in packs of four for Pounds 1.85 as part
of the mail-order operation, headed by third director Diane Harper.
The cardboard toy theatre is another Victorian speciality that Sid Templer
has reintroduced. 'I was always interested in toy theatres, but really, like
a lot of our successes I put its entry into the Tobar catalogue largely down
to luck,' he said.
'It was a cold February day in 1990. There was a knock on the door in this
remote part of Norfolk and it was a man with plans for several full-scale
toy theatres. He explained that he was a former theatre director with a
passion for toy theatres and theatre history and he wanted to do business
with us.
'Four years later we reckon we are the biggest suppliers of Victorian-style
toy theatres in the country.'
An offshoot was the series of theatrical jumping jacks, that, like many
lines, have developed organically from others, and appear in both the mail
order and trade catalogues.
The company has never made a loss and Templer does not think business would
have been so good if he had not developed the skill of what he calls
'listening to improbable people'. The tables in the large book-lined room in
his house that is the company nerve-centre groan under piles of packages
containing ideas and samples of novelties from people who have approached
him.
'Somehow they manage to find us,' he said. 'However, this is not to say we
do not go out to find ideas. We exhibit at four gift fairs in the UK and
Germany every year and we are very receptive to ideas.'
Tobar does its importing through agents, and finances this by means of
letters of credit. 'We have never had any problems with this arrangement,
nor with our bank, Barclays,' Templer said.
'The only time we have ever had a major loan was seven years ago when we
bought the freehold here for Pounds 250,000. We still have a Pounds 100,000
loan on the property through Barclays, and although we have an overdraft
facility I can't remember the figure, as we so rarely use it.'
Collecting money from retailers can be a problem, but Templer has two key
policies that help. Tobar will not supply goods until the previous account
has been settled, and the company offers a 5 per cent discount to retailers
who settle within 10 days. Templer says it is 'unwise' of Tobar to offer
this discount, and equally unwise for his customers not to make use of it.
'But it suits our office procedure - or lack of it,' he added.
Templer does not know whether it is the mail-order or the trade side of
Tobar that has the bigger turnover, but he is categorical about the
financial success of his company.
'In 1993 our turnover was 28 per cent up on that of 1992, and that was 40
per cent up on 1991, which in turn was 29 per cent up on 1990. In its last
complete year Tobar made a net profit of Pounds 225,500 on a turnover of
Pounds 2.5m,' he said.
'In the run-up to Christmas we are bursting at the seams, with countless
part-time staff in addition to our dozen regulars. We had to have a
temporary marquee to hold excess stock and we desperately need some new
storage buildings. The business seems to be recession-proof - but really I
don't know why]'

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Dog days in a year that matched its
name - Hong Kong / Bearish sentiment has plagued stock prices. Will 1995 be
any better?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hang Seng index, Hong Kong's stock market barometer, improved nearly 5
per cent this week. But this technical rebound, achieved on the back of thin
turnover, has done little to detract from the bearish sentiment that has
plagued stock prices since the beginning of the year.
This sentiment has ensured that, in the Year of the Dog, the Hong Kong
market has proved to be just that for investors.
After a promising start, which saw the index peak at over 12,000 just four
days into the new year, Hong Kong stock prices have succumbed to rising
interest rates, falling property prices, and fears over the Chinese
economy's ability to engineer a soft landing. The index is now 33 per cent
off the January 4 peak.
In recent weeks, fund managers have been selling down the market in a bid to
raise cash to meet redemptions - a reversal of the institutional activity
this time last year when foreign funds were reputed to be buying anything
with China, or even Asia, in its name.
The prospects for the traditional lunar new year rally (the new year falls
at the end of January) look increasingly dim, although many brokerage houses
are predicting a turnaround in 1995.
Stuart Cook, chief executive of Morgan Grenfell Asia Securities, says a mix
of attractive valuations and flattening yield curves should turn the tide
for equity performances, especially in the second half of next year. The
Hong Kong market is now trading on a price/earnings multiple of around 10
times 1995 earnings.
He says: 'In the first half of 1995, we will see more pain coming through on
the interest rate front, with short-term rates continuing to rise fairly
swiftly but the long end has now stabilised.
'By the second half of 1995, (US) Fed rates will be more or less up to where
they are going, so a lot of the pain will be finished - which ought to be
good news (for equities).'
Corporate earnings across the board are expected to grow at only 17 per cent
in 1995, compared with 19 per cent this year. One reason for this drop is
the expected inability of developers to to maintain earnings momentum.
The US-led interest rate rises, fed through to Hong Kong via the dollar/Hong
Kong dollar currency peg, also have taken their toll on the property market.
Around 40 per cent of the Hang Seng is exposed to the property market.
But the sector has chalked up some of the year's biggest losses as the cost
of servicing mortgages has risen and developers have been forced to trim the
cost of new projects.
The sector first fell out of favour in March when Chris Patten, the colony's
governor, announced his intention to set up a task force to look into the
over-heating property market. This bid to temper prices came after a 200 per
cent increase over three years in the cost of homes.
The task force's recommendations, aimed largely at speculators, were
implemented in June and these, together with rises in interest rates, have
sliced around 15 to 20 per cent off home prices this year. Standard
Chartered bank is looking for a further fall of 10 to 15 per cent next year;
others expect to see still bigger drops.
Political events have played little part on the sentiment-driven Hong Kong
market this year, just as last year's Sino-British wrangling failed to avert
the index from soaring ever higher on a flood of liquidity .
But the decision by the Jardine camp to de-list from Hong Kong, allied to
further attacks from China - which claimed the company had been awarded a
container terminal contract unfairly in return for political favours - sent
its shares tumbling.
In China, premature but frequent reports of the death of paramount leader
Deng Xiaoping drove the index lower, as did fears over out-of-control
inflation and bad debts. The debts issue hit the headlines when Lehman
Brothers said it would sue three of China's biggest trading companies for
failing to pay Dollars 100m alleged to be owing from foreign exchange
trading.
Hong Kong's fortunes are linked closely with those of the Republic although,
so far, investment in domestic China has been modest. Instead, companies are
focused on export-oriented industries in southern China which, says Cook,
will benefit only as Europe and Japan, moving out of recession, increase
spending.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Brazil, so near, but yet so far -
In the Pink / David Roche suggests how to waken a sleeping giant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID ROCHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Roche, an expert on the emerging markets of south-east Asia, is
president of Independent Strategy, a new investment research boutique.
It would take so little to get things right in Brazil. This vast country has
half the land mass, half the people and more than 45 per cent of the output
of Latin America. If Brazil turns, it could be the tide that transforms the
region into an alternative to Asia as a magnet for global capital. But while
the country's economic potential is as immense as its area, it is untapped.
The causes of Brazil's domestic economic failure run from inflation to
under-investment, through low productivity to dreadful return on capital.
This return (about one-third of that in booming east Asia) has driven the
market to high price/earnings (P/E) ratios but with meagre price to book
values (P/BVs).
The Brazilian economy is the most sophisticated inflation-neutralising
machine in the world. Indeed, it has shielded the bureaucracy, the army and
the middle class from inflation's ravaging effects and made the rich even
richer. The losers, of course, have been the poor.
The incoming president, Fernando Cardoso, got elected for the popularity of
his astutely-timed real plan which aims, among other things, to maintain the
new currency's value by controlling inflation through tight fiscal and
monetary measures.
It has made the poor less poor by removing the inflation tax on their cash
wages (the 12 per cent of Brazilians with bank accounts have them indexed
against inflation). Now, he has to make it stick and deliver prosperity to
all.
When inflation was up in the sky, investment was slammed to the floor. The
Brazilian economy is like a giant, under-capitalised, factory with rotten
productivity, low savings and low investment.
To change all this, inflation must fall to single digits and stay there;
real return on investment would then rise. Free enterprise also needs to be
rid of the dead hand of government. If these things were done, the
productivity of capital and labour would rise and the impact on the equity
market of rising real returns on capital, plus falling inflation, would be
electric.
Brazil has an expensive P/E but a cheap P/BV because the implied return on
equity is only about 5 per cent. If it rose to the Spanish average of 11 per
cent, stock prices would double. This, however, is a big 'if'. The pain of
producing permanently low inflation could be too great for a Brazilian-style
democracy.
Indeed, I know of no case except Poland where a coalition government has
opted for socially painful economic reform (and it happened there only
because it marked such a decisive break with the hated Soviet system).
Cardoso's new government is composed of really nice, honest, European-style
social democrats who are closer to Germany's Willy Brandt than the UK's
Margaret Thatcher. Undoubtedly, the country is going to get its best and
most ethical administration in memory, But its members are more suited to
intellectual debate on reform than implementing it. There is nary a 'doer'
among them.
Then, too, no one in Brazil thinks that wringing inflation out of the system
will hurt. But it will - almost as badly as it has done in central Europe.
Besides which, those who really matter have not suffered enough from
inflation to bear the pain of reform. Worse still, those who did suffer may
have felt it too much to put up with reform now.
Government in Brazil is as big as Europe's (42 per cent of GDP) and a long
way from east Asia's 18 per cent. But Brazil has revealed no big budget
deficits, thanks to the inflation it created. Yet, once inflation stops, the
government deficit rockets. That means spending - particularly on welfare,
plus pensions and salaries for the bureaucracy  - must fall and
privatisations must rise.
Real wages have jumped and price rises have slowed - but productivity has
not risen. If inflation stays down and state enterprises are privatised,
over-employment - which I would estimate at a third of the labour force -
will become impaled upon the horns of rising real costs and static
productivity.
Of course, productivity gains will follow, but only after rationalisation
and investment. That is not going to happen tomorrow.
Meanwhile, the social cost of economic re-structuring has not even begun to
hurt. The popularity of reform among the poor is based on the blissful
ignorance of a cruel fact: reform means job losses.
The coming months will tell if Cardoso is the instrument, rather than the
victim, of Brazilian reform. He has to strengthen the autonomy of the
central bank, introduce tax reforms and balance the budget in real money
terms.
He must abolish wage indexation - the heart of the Brazilian inflation
spiral. And he must privatise state assets.
These changes are stepping stones across the spated river of Brazil's
contrary history. It is not clear if Cardoso will, ultimately, fall in the
flood or make it across. He could make all the right moves - and then see
delivery fall short of market expectations.
In that event, the equity market would follow the same pattern: up, and then
down. Inflation would sink to around 50 per cent next year but then rise.
And the real would depreciate by at least 20 per cent against the dollar by
the end of next year.
Yet, even annual inflation of 50 to 100 per cent over the next couple of
years would be a big break with history - and it generates some interesting
investment themes. There are some solid infrastructure plays, such as
Usiminas in steel and Cemig in electricity. Electricity could be the first
for privatisation, so Electrobas could have a great run. The major
casualties of lower inflation would be the banks, with their huge cost
structure and burgeoning bad debts.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Witches lurk behind the Christmas
tree - Wall Street - As the Dow bubbles unexpectedly, Patrick Harverson
predicts trouble ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The only predictable feature of the stock market this year has been its
unpredictability. A little more than a week ago, Wall Street was reeling
from a 50-point loss on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It was the latest
in a string of big sell-offs which had dragged blue-chip stocks close to
their lows of the year and sucked much of the confidence out of the market.
At the time, investors - already bruised by rising interest rates and fears
of a darkening economic outlook - were also being battered by the biggest
municipal bankruptcy in US history and the mysterious cancellation of a
Dollars 2bn cash distribution by the nation's biggest mutual fund. The
climate on Wall Street was so chilly that most pundits predicted that the
market would miss its traditional year-end rise in share prices - the
so-called 'December rally'.
This week, however, the mood abruptly changed, and like many of the market's
moves this year, initially no one was quite sure what was behind the shift.
Since its big decline on December 8, the Dow has rebounded more than 90
points, or 2.5 per cent. Now, talk of a December rally is being revived, and
investors are realising that there may be something under the Christmas tree
for them, after all.
The market's turnaround can be traced to the easing of fears that the
Federal Reserve would raise interest rates once more before the year ended.
The selling of shares in early December followed a strong November
employment report which led some analysts to predict that the Fed would
tighten monetary policy for the seventh, and final, time this year after the
December 20 meeting of its open market committee.
To this grim prospect of yet another rate increase was added the bankruptcy
of Orange County, California, and the cancelled payout at the Fidelity
Group's Magellan Fund. Although neither story had direct implications for
share prices (the Orange county debacle only briefly roiled the bond market
after it sparked a fire sale of billions of dollars in government agency
securities, and the Magellan mix-up subsequently proved to be the product of
a mathematical mistake), they clearly undercut sentiment.
In the past week, however, a string of economic data has forced analysts to
reconsider their predictions of a December 20 interest rate increase. The
most important statistics concerned inflation. On Tuesday and Wednesday the
government reported that producer prices rose by 0.5 per cent and consumer
prices rose by 0.3 per cent in November. Neither figure was encouraging, but
in both cases the closely-watched 'core' measure of price inflation (which
excludes volatile components which distort the indices) rose at a slower
rate than expected. The market was also encouraged by a report from the
Philadelphia Fed which showed signs of moderate growth in business activity
and only mild inflationary pressures in the region.
Taken together, the data comforted investors who had been worried about
another tightening of monetary policy. Ironically, the Orange County
bankruptcy may also have contributed to the easing of investors' fears,
because another rise in interest rates would have further undermined the
value of Orange County's troubled bond and derivatives portfolio.
Stocks were also aided this week by fresh declines in bond yields. In the
past eight days the yield on the 30-year bond has dropped from 8 per cent to
7.85 per cent. This has helped allay concerns that rising bond yields would
lure cash out of stocks into the Treasury market. The favourable move in
bonds, however, has been offset by a sharp rise in yields on shorter-term
government securities, such as two-year notes. This divergence has led to a
further flattening in the yield curve - the graph of yields on securities
with differing maturities - and, as bond market analysts never tire of
pointing out, a rapid flattening of the yield curve typically precedes a
sharp slowdown in economic growth.
To most equity investors, however, the flattening yield curve is a technical
phenomenon of little interest, and this weekend they are likely to be
basking in the warm glow of the Dow's best weekly showing since early
October.
Yet, they should be warned against making too much of the gains of the past
five days because for most of the week trading was greatly influenced by the
manoeuvrings of institutions ahead of Friday afternoon's 'triple-witching
hour'. Triple-witching is the name given to the simultaneous expiration of
stock options and futures, which happens four times a year and often
produces exceptional short-term movements in share prices.
This week, these movements were mostly upwards, which made for some handsome
gains in the Dow. Yet, they were gains which only cloaked the market's
underlying weaknesses - without them, the Dow's advance would have been
modest. Come Monday, share prices are likely to drop initially, and the
market will almost certainly be sporting a triple-witching-sized hangover.

FT  17 DEC 94 / The bubbles that bind Britain: Charles and Di, Angie and
Dirty Den. Soap operas are today's social glue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER

<TEXT>
In Jonathan Dimbleby's new biography, Prince Charles is quoted as saying
that the collapse of his marriage 'had all the ingredients of a Greek
tragedy'. In fact, the story resembles nothing so much as a soap opera.
The features that make soap opera popular - a family that becomes public
property; the focus on personalities; the obsession with sexual morality;
the mix of glamour, intimacy - are precisely those that keep the royal
family in the headlines.
Until the 19th century, the great forces for social cohesion in Britain were
the monarchy and the church. Today they are the monarchy and soap opera.
When Angie walked out on Dirty Den in the BBC television soap EastEnders,
31m people watched - more than half the country. Regular audiences of 17m
tune into Coronation Street, 14m to EastEnders and 4m to Radio 4's The
Archers. Most people in Britain can name a character from each of these
soaps.
Two hundred years ago, by contrast, few people could have named any
fictional character, but almost all could have explained the story depicted
on the stained-glass window of the village church. Now few of us have a clue
about religious iconography. Instead, in a fragmented culture, soap opera is
the only entertainment that ensures, as the church formerly did, that people
across generations and social classes share a set of references, and discuss
the same issues at the same time.
When, for example, in The Archers last Christmas, Susan Carter, mother of
two, was jailed for shielding her brother from the police, the episode
caused a national outcry, provoking leading articles on crime and punishment
in three national newspapers, and public statements from Michael Howard, the
Home Secretary - and an Archers fan - and from the Lord Chief Justice.
Soap opera is no longer just easy entertainment. Programmes such as The
Archers, EastEnders and Brookside focus on our deepest social and moral
concerns. Marriage and family values; abortion and Aids; rising crime and
unemployment are their subjects. They also deal with timeless human
feelings: love, betrayal, fear, loneliness. Soap deals, in short, with
subjects which were once the prerogative of the Church. They also do what
Shakespeare's Hamlet said drama should do: 'Hold the mirror up to nature',
and reflect 'the very age and body of the time.' Why are they so popular and
so powerfully emotive, and what do they tell us about our culture and life?
In each century an art form emerges which comes to dominate the nation and
embody its values. That art is always changed by the technological
possibilities of the time. For the Victorians it was the novel, which
reached a mass market because of the opportunity for cheap printing in the
new industrial society. In the 17th century, it was Revenge Tragedy, which
grew out of the beginnings of public theatres, and in the Middle Ages, it
was courtly love poetry, recited aloud and passed on by oral tradition in
the days before printing.
Today, it is soap opera, the populist drama of an age in which television
and radio have supplanted the printed word as media of communication.
Television's special virtues are intimacy, continuity, and mesmeric realism.
These three qualities are precisely those which make soap opera so
successful. Soap is therefore a natural genre for the small screen. On many
weekday evenings, television means soap opera to most people - Coronation
Street attracts 70 per cent of all viewers, EastEnders 65 per cent.
Who is watching? The main soap operas have distinct class and regional
profiles. The Archers is a middle class soap so when Caroline Bone tries to
lure her putative lover into bed she invites him away for the night to hear
the Christmas Oratorio in Birmingham. EastEnders is a working class soap, so
Phil and Kathy's engagement party is a knees-up in the pub. Brookside is a
Liverpool soap; on the cutting edge of urban social problems, it thrives on
strong local accents and Merseyside humour.
Although audiences reflect these features, soaps appeal across the classes
and regions. The Archers audience includes a far higher percentage of
working-class listeners than Radio 4's average audience. Brookside (6m
viewers) has a loyal following in the north of England, but is also popular
with young London professionals - reflecting Channel 4's middle-class
profile. EastEnders also has many middle-class fans. Neighbours (10m
viewers), with its light-hearted romances and sunny backcloth, appeals to
children of all classes.
Coronation Street viewers are mostly working class - ITV's traditional
audience. Years after they have left the series, characters from this
longest running TV soap, such as the matriarch Ena Sharples and sexpot Elsie
Tanner - James Callaghan, a former prime minister, called her 'the sexiest
woman on TV' - remain in the popular imagination, like Mr Micawber or
Scrooge. They suggest that soap opera is essentially a democratising form,
delivering into the family living-room regular everyday drama which millions
of people experience at the same time, and discuss next morning.
The combination of a mass audience and a serial form of fiction is
explosive. It is a relatively new phenomenon - Dickens discovered it in the
19th century, and made a fortune serialising his novels before publication.
When the Old Curiosity Shop was running in the 1850s, hundreds of readers
wrote begging him not to kill off the heroine, Little Nell. When she did
die, top-hatted men wept in the street on hearing the news. It was reported
that 'the nation was drowned in a wave of grief', and Dickens received so
many mourning letters that he felt he had committed a murder.
Soap opera is a descendant of the Victorian serial novel. It uses the same
storytelling techniques - cliff-hangers, melodrama, sentimentality - to win
a devoted following. Vanessa Whitburn, producer of The Archers says her
primary aim is 'to produce good drama which makes audiences cry, makes them
happy, surprises them and sometimes shocks them.'
The Archers storyline which reached a climax this autumnwith the birth of
Shula's baby, after a desperate series of fertility treatments and the death
of her husband in a car crash, is an example of how the Dickensian methods
still work in an updated 1990 context. Like the serial novel, The Archers'
plots are planned months or years in advance, but each episode is produced
at a frenetic pace. There are eight writers - those who cut their teeth on
the series include best-selling novelist Susan Hill - and after the monthly
script meeting, they each complete the week's worth of scripts in a
fortnight. Twenty episodes are then recorded in six days. Topical events are
written in, during a flurry of re-recording, on the day of transmission.
'Charles Dickens was my teacher,' says Julia Smith, the producer who devised
EastEnders. 'He had the gift of combining reality with fairy stories. I
don't think we are doing much that Dickens had not done before.'
That mix of escapism and social authenticity lies at the core of British
soap opera. Soaps tug the heartstrings because they invite everyday
involvement with another family or community whose intimacies and
indiscretions become, like those of the royal family, public secrets.
Hedli Nicklaus, who plays Kathy Perks in the series and runs Archers
Addicts, the fan club whose members include Norma Major and Adam Faith, says
soap works because 'it lives in people's heads, and when it's in your head,
it becomes part of your own world picture'.
In extreme cases, viewers identify so completely with the soap world that
they send characters wedding presents or apply for jobs at Brookfield Farm
or the Queen Vic pub. (Traditionally readers of fiction have done the same:
the Royal Mail continues to receive letters addressed to Sherlock Holmes,
Baker Street.)
But this empathy is grounded in the acute realism with which characters and
settings are portrayed. Divorce, racism, cancer scares, children running
away from home, dodgy business deals - these are daily events in soap.
Behind them is a strong educational and moral impetus, sometimes even a
pioneering social conscience.
The Archers began in 1951 as a family drama aimed at teaching farmers how to
increase food production during post-war shortages. Now Brookside, says
Philip Reevel, head of corporate affairs at Merseyside Television, confronts
'a question of how television can accommodate both entertainment and real
social issues'.
Brookside has recently featured the murder of a wife-beating father, a
lesbian affair, and the birth of a Down's syndrome baby. Reevel called the
programmes methods 'hyper-realistic': a high concentration of controversial
dramatic incidents within a small community. The key to soap success, he
suggests, is 'the programme makers' ability to anticipate popular tastes and
concerns'.
Impeccable social research is the backbone of soap opera. The names of many
EastEnders characters were taken from cemeteries in east London. The armed
robbery in The Archers was inspired by a conversation between the producer
Vanessa Whitburn and police officers worried about the rise in violent crime
in rural areas. The Archers employs not only an agricultural adviser but a
permanent consultant obstetrician. The story of Shula's infertility
treatment rang so true that the BBC was overwhelmed with letters from
empathising listeners.
A chief pleasure of British soap comes from empathy - from recognising
oneself as the drama holds 'the mirror up to nature'. It is emphasised by a
comparison with US soaps, which offer pure fantasy - mega-rich Dallas oil
magnates, Dynasty's sumptuous mansion 'Fioli' - and invite not
identification or social debate but the schadenfreude of 'let's watch the
rich screw up'.
British soaps are by contrast highly moralistic. Tony Warren, who invented
Coronation Street in 1960, summed up the series as 'a fascinating
freemasonry, a volume of unwritten rules. These are the driving forces
behind a working-class street in the north of England. Coronation Street
sets out to explore these values and in doing so, to entertain.'
Today, Brookside debates the vices of capitalist tax-evaders versus the
jobless on the fiddle. EastEnders is currently running an explosive tale of
sexual ethics, about the break-up of Sharon and Grant Mitchell's marriage
after she slept with his brother Phil.
Commuting between the intensive care ward, where Phil lay after Grant tried
to murder him, and the pub, each character has offered a comment on the
morality of cheating, revenge and forgiveness. Barbara Windsor made her
debut in the programme, as the feuding men's mother, with a homily on family
values. The story is as primitively compelling as Cain and Abel.
One reason soap operas are so dramatically powerful is the clever adaptation
of archetypes - EastEnders' Don Juan villain Dirty Den, The Archers village
idiot Eddie Grundy, reformed superbitch Elizabeth Archer - into topical
British settings. They build age-old dramatic conflicts in a modern context.
The Archer sisters (Shula and Elizabeth) at different times involved with
the same man, for example, recall Elizabeth and Lydia Bennett in Pride and
Prejudice; but their recent dilemmas have been abortion, IVF treatment, and
whether one might adopt the illegitimate child of the other.
'The Archers is living drama not a museum piece,' says Whitburn who, since
joining the series from Brookside two years ago, has catapulted Ambridge up
to date. Nostalgia and continuity, however, are also crucial to the appeal:
issues, characters, move with the times, but soap operas always retain the
structure and milieu of opening episodes.
The Archers (1951) still follows the farming calendar. Coronation Street
(1960) is a dream of working-class solidarity in back-to-back terraces. The
new housing estate at Brookside (1982) and the market stalls and
entrepreneurial car dealers and cafe owners of EastEnders (1985) are obvious
products of the Thatcherite 1980s.
Where is the soap opera of the 1990s? Eldorado (1992) flopped, although in
many ways it spoke for the decade - jet-setting lifestyles, international
profile, a group of people who happened to have landed in the same place
rather than growing up together in a traditional, outdated community. The
reasons for its failure are still discussed - no social roots, and thus
inauthentic characters? No clear niche market? Given insufficient time to
prove itself? But the BBC is unlikely to try again.
Soap operas are potentially lucrative. Their name comes from their original
association with soap manufacturers, such as Procter and Gamble, which
sponsored radio serials for housewives in the 1920s to advertise their
products. They continue to be an advertisers' dream. Brookside is Channel
4's best-rated show. For a satellite company such as Sky One, a compelling
soap opera would be manna from heaven.
Will they endure as art? It is an open question.
Unlike the popular form of earlier periods such as Dickens's novels and
Shakespeare's tragedies, soap operas are by nature ephemeral. They are the
easy viewing option of our lazy undemanding television age. Each episode of
EastEnders, for example, is too simple and banal to be watched a second or
third time, in the way that we can re-read a Dickens novel and discover new
pleasures and meanings.
On the other hand, soap operas speak of important social and emotional
concern to a mass audience; despite their vulgarities and their formulaic
presentation, they deliver some of the moral sustenance that Dickens offered
in the 19th century and Shakespeare in the 17th.
On the Radio 4 programme Desert Island Discs last month, Sir George
Christie, chairman of Glyndebourne, selected many classical operas, and then
chose as his luxury a complete recording of The Archers from 1951 until
today.
If his stash were to be found in 100 years, it is unlikely that The Archers
would be regarded as a successor to Mozart or Verdi, but it would provide a
fascinating and unmatchable panorama of Britain in the second half of the
20th century.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Down with the lottery]: Britain's new game of fantasy
finance will do far more harm than good
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The national lottery is fantasy finance. It ranks with fantasy football,
another television game, and fantasy fornication, enjoyed by viewers of
Bumwatch and similar programmes. It is a leisure industry created to exploit
our sole remaining unprivatisable asset, our national imagination. It is a
tax on the poor derided by the rich, a machine for the creation of a
spurious sense of self-satisfaction for the pathetic boobies who toss their
coins into its maw.
There is nothing of worth in this crap game, no net gain for charities, no
work of art saved or building erected that could not have been financed by
less preposterous means, no true promise of glory for the millennium, no
benefit to anyone save perhaps the shareholders of Camelotta Suckers, plc.
You will have gathered that I do not wholeheartedly admire the gamble so
many millions of our brothers and sisters have been seduced into taking.
Right first time. You will not catch me buying a ticket. Anyone who goes for
a 14m-to-1 shot is simple; that so many do is a nuisance. I queued to pay
for a Christmas present in WH Smith last week and found after 10 minutes
that it was the 'lottery only' line. The same double-take frustrated me when
I tracked down one of Britain's dwindling collection of main post offices to
have my seasonal gift weighed.
Two large chains of newsagents, WHS and John Menzies, have been reported as
expressing concern about the disrupting effect of long lottery queues in
their stores. The rake-off is only 5 per cent, which must be compared with
what ought to be higher margins on sales of tangible goods such as
magazines, stationery, and confectionery. Maybe retailers will profit one
day. We shall see. They must count against business lost the gain in
customers drawn into their shops by the urge to waste money. There can be no
calculations until after Christmas.
Charities will certainly lose. Donations will fall by Pounds 172m a year,
according to a survey carried out for the National Council for Voluntary
Organisations. The lottery masters predict a handover of Pounds 136m from
their proceeds. That leaves good causes Pounds 36m short.
Wait, the merchants of fools' gold will say. These are only estimates. Maybe
the numbers will turn out more favourably. Only Camelotta Suckers can
believe that. Anyone else who does is not thinking. Maybe? Maybe the rail
privatisation will go smoothly. Maybe the board of British Gas has
demonstrated a fine grasp of fair salary structures. Maybe Mr Tony Blair
will become a socialist. We know what will happen to charities. The evidence
is there. A state lottery was introduced in Ireland in 1987. Last year Irish
charities were asked about its effect. Some 87 per cent said they had lost
out.
The rest of the scheme is a swindle. Charities constitute one of five groups
that will share the 28 per cent of punters' payments set aside as conscience
money. The other four - the arts, sports, the national heritage and the
'millennium' fund - have been promised that the treasury will not claw back
their lottery income by reducing allocations from the national exchequer.
Talk about suckers] This is a government promise, like April 1992's 'no new
taxes'.
Let us be generous. Say the treasury allows the lottery pot a few years'
free run. What then? Stephen Dorrell has asked for ideas from readers of The
Sun. 'Do you play football or hockey . . . ?' asks the heritage secretary.
'How would you fancy new, fully-equipped changing rooms?' Perhaps wheelchair
access to local historic buildings or refurbishment of the local art
gallery? Mr Dorrell has no shame. 'It is not too far-fetched to believe,' he
writes, 'that new indoor tennis courts paid for by the National Lottery
could provide the next British Wimbledon champion.' In the immortal words of
hucksters everywhere, he appends the warning, 'some applications will be
lucky, others will not'.
Our Mr Dorrell is one of the better ministers in John Major's cabinet. He is
not a natural born con-man. It is a pity he has been given so demeaning a
task. Perhaps he is carried away by the supposed glamour of the idea, as was
the BBC when it allotted prime time to the draw, thus producing one of the
most humiliating programmes it has ever transmitted. Happily, it has come a
cropper, ratings are down, and the time for second thoughts has arrived.
Others apparently having second thoughts this week were the 'XXX's', the
reportedly Moslem family whose main breadwinner scooped just about Pounds
18m. This led to a comedy of pretence, as the lottery promoters sought to
show that they would stick to their undertaking not to disclose the name of
winners who preferred anonymity. They went to the high court for an
injunction. The tabloid papers do not like that. They printed and lavishly
illustrated everything they could dig up about the newly-rich individual,
save his name, then had the injunction removed.
It is delightful when thieves fall out. On this occasion those who conspire
to steal our common sense, Camelot and the tabloids, staged a convincing
quarrel from which, no doubt, both profited in the form of greater dollops
of the notoriety they so avidly seek. The question of the week became:
should winners have the right of privacy? The answer: no, not really, but
Camelot must be seen to be rigorous in its efforts to maintain any
contractual obligation it may have to protect winners from discovery.
As to our 'lucky' northern family, we cannot yet be certain that it will
bless the day its numbers came up. Games of chance, according to the Koran,
are abominations devised by Satan. 'They ask you about drinking and
gambling,' says the holy book. 'Say: 'There is great harm in both, although
they have some benefit for men; but their harm is far greater than their
benefit'.' Drinkers may demur, but, as to the lottery, the Islamic view is
sheer common sense.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Church with its future in the balance -
Andrew Adonis reports on the financial crisis threatening to engulf
Anglicans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Money may be the root of all evil but, for the Church of England, the
absence of money is a more pressing concern. England's state Church faces a
financial crisis which, fittingly, reflects in microcosm the predicament of
the nation's welfare state.
The C of E's pensions bill is rising far faster than its income, and its
central funding agency is seeking desperately to relieve itself of the
burden while wrestling with a host of other demands from dioceses and
parishes which have long treated it as a sugar daddy.
The temporal parallel does not end there for, in seeking to put its finances
on a sustainable footing, the Church is confronting the stark reality that
money is power. Beneath the clerical decorum, a struggle over the C of E's
power structure is gathering pace in which issues of authority and doctrine
are revolving increasingly around control of the purse strings. A passionate
Anglican debate about subsidiarity - how far down the church hierarchy power
should reside - is under way. Some fear this could lead to the break-up of
the Church founded by Saint Augustine in 597.
As with the welfare state, the roots of today's crisis lie in the years
following the second world war when commitments to pensions and other
benefits were made. These have grown so much that, by last year, pensions
consumed nearly half the Pounds 146m of support provided for the C of E by
its central funding agency, the Church Commissioners.
The agency was established by parliament in 1948 with assets intended to be
used to help pay the clergy and fund poorer parishes. In 1954, it was given
the added responsibility of clergy pensions. Popular wisdom has it that the
Church's finances jogged along well enough until the mid-1980s when the
commissioners ventured into property speculation. This proved disastrous and
led to a situation where the clergy faced being turned on to the streets.
No one denies the commissioners' ineptitude but the context is significant -
not just the 1980s' property boom, but unprecedented pressure on the agency
to produce ever-greater income to keep the Church afloat. Yet, even at its
peak, the agency funded less than a third of the C of E's annual budget of
Pounds 600m; parishes and dioceses were responsible for most of the rest.
Given market trends, the commissioners would have required the wisdom of
Solomon to be yielding more than an extra Pounds 35m each year to support
the church. So, with budgetary pressures growing over the long term, a
financial crisis always was likely.
What to do? State aid would be an obvious solution. Apart from tax relief on
covenants, the government provides only trifling sums to sustain the Church,
mainly for restoring cathedrals and listed buildings. Germany, by contrast,
has a state tax which yields its churches a lavish income. But such an
option is not remotely on the agenda in England; barely 3 per cent of the
population attends an Anglican church regularly, while the other 97 per cent
has no desire to pay more tax for anything.
State aid aside, there are only two other options: massive retrenchment, or
a significant increase in income raised from church-goers in the 13,000
parishes. The first would be likely to end the C of E as we know it. But the
second - greater efforts to raise money from collection plates and
individual covenants - could have equally far-reaching consequences.
The commissioners are leading the way. Under a plan announced last month,
parishes would take responsibility for their clergy's pensions from 1998. A
new pension fund, endowed with between a third and a half of the Pounds
2.4bn assets held by the commissioners, would cover liabilities up to the
transfer date.
The Church Times pointed to the positive side of the proposal when it
referred to 'less reliance on 'dead men's money' and . . . a greater sense
of local lay responsibility for the Church's paid servants'.
If they have to pay more, however, parishes will want a greater say over how
their money is spent. Some are intent on using their financial muscle
effectively to take control of the Church. This is apparent from the
activities of a movement called Reform, which is sponsored by leading
evangelicals and has more than 1,000 members, half of them clergy.
Reform's leaders include the Rev Philip Hacking, vicar of Christ Church at
Fulwood, Sheffield, which has a total Sunday congregation of 1,500. Christ
Church has 'capped' its quota at Pounds 52,000 instead of the Pounds 70,000
requested by the diocese. Since the diocesan levy is 'voluntary', there is
little bishops can do if affluent parishes refuse to pay.
Hacking is concerned about diocesan bureaucracy but sees a basic principle
at stake. He points out: 'There is no such thing as a diocese in the Bible -
the local church is the focal point.' He wants more of them in the image of
his own.
Hacking adds: 'We are unhappy with clergy who preach a non-biblical gospel -
for instance, on homosexuality - and we do not want to give a blank cheque
to dioceses to support a ministry of which we do not approve.' Instead,
Christ Church is using its money and initiative to revive a parish in nearby
Rotherham. But Robin Stevens, the C of E's central stewardship officer,
warns: 'We have to be careful not to become congregational, with no regard
for the national Church.'
The debate now focuses on a commission examining the central structure of
the Church and chaired by the newly-installed bishop of Durham, the Rt Rev
Michael Turnbull. It is expected to report by next summer.
Some regard it as significant that, during the controversy earlier this year
over his conviction 26 years earlier for indecency, Turnbull called his
clergy together to ask if he should continue in office. 'That would have
been unthinkable in times past,' says one observer. Yet, if the parish
clergy become the C of E's paymaster, it might soon become standard practice
for decision-making in the Church.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Let's drink to '94, in castor oil - It was a
disappointing year overall, but at least it was healthy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a hell of a first half, but the rest of the year has left us
disappointed rather than devastated. Despite a couple of half-point rises in
short-term interest rates, the FT-SE 100 index stands slightly above its
end-June level of 2,919 and the long-dated gilt-edged yield has held at 8.6
per cent (although only after hitting an intermediate high point of 9 per
cent late in September).
Going back a year, however, the bull market enthusiasm was all-pervading.
The only way for the stock market was up, most analysts said. Some talked
about 4,000 on the Footsie, hardly any about 3,000.
My own opinion of the FT-SE 100 index at 3,400 was cynical. We were in the
late, panic-buying stage of the bull market, I said. Prices might
temporarily move higher, but equities were only for the brave and the
nimble. There was a chance that the dividend yield on the market as a whole
would be pushed down to 3 per cent - but, by then, all the warning lights
would be flashing red. In the event, it dipped no further than 3.2 per cent
at the market's peak on February 2.
Events unfolded a little more quickly than I had envisaged. January indeed
saw a dash from cash, as small investors piled into the two European
privatisation investment trusts which were launched opportunistically by
Mercury and Kleinwort Benson: they raised Pounds 1,075m between them, on
which original subscribers are showing an average loss of 17 1/2 per cent
now.
There was a smell of the notorious Royal Event: an over-hyped,
sucker-gathering, unit trust launch in September 1987. But it turned out to
be not quite so bad: instead of collapsing by 25 per cent in a few days, the
London stock market took nearly five months to fall by 18 per cent.
In fact, though, the equity shake-out was a bit of a sideshow. The real
story of 1994 has been one of a global bond market crash. Fixed-interest
securities finally shook off their boring image and staged a tumble as they
reversed the bull market of 1993 on a rather swifter timetable.
In 1993, long-dated gilt yields had fallen from 9 per cent late in January
to 6.5 per cent at the year-end, generating a total investment return for
1993 of 34 per cent - which was more than on equities. That movement had
been reversed entirely by September this year and, although there has been
some recovery since, the negative return on long gilts has been about 12 per
cent - a little worse than on equities. So much for the traditional idea
that bonds are less risky than shares.
The reason is partly that huge government deficits around the world have
collided with a vigorous economic recovery, pushing up bond yields. But the
scale of the boom and bust in global bonds has reflected the huge growth in
speculation by, among others, hedge funds and the so-called proprietary
trading teams of banks and securities houses.
Plenty about 1994 has been positive, however. Economic growth has soared
above expectations whereas inflation has under-shot. British companies as a
whole have become very prosperous, recording a record financial surplus in
the first half-year.
Yet, the stock market can seem perverse. Last year, I remarked that the
All-Share index had risen by 64 per cent in three years while dividends had
increased not at all. In 1994, dividends have bounded up by an unexpectedly
healthy 8 per cent but the All-Share has tumbled by 12 per cent.
Such share price behaviour might seem disappointing and puzzling to many
investors, but it is predictable. Remember that, in buoyant economic
conditions, it is not share prices that go up but expected rates of return.
Share prices fall so that equities can compete, in terms of future
potential, against price-insensitive competition - such as bonds issued by
free-spending governments. In a growing economy, capital is in greater
demand.
Fortunately, the British government - more nimbly than many others - is
reducing its borrowing requirement rapidly. But the influx of speculative
foreign money which flooded in during 1993 (when overseas buyers bought
Pounds 16.6bn of gilts) has halted, and been reversed slightly, in recent
months.
Essentially, the sharp rise in bond yields between February and June
reflected the necessary adjustment before domestic buyers would absorb all
that the Bank of England had to sell. Equities had to move roughly in line,
because a ratio between gilt-edged and equity yields of much more than 2 is
unsustainable. So, the yield on the All-Share has moved up to 4.1 per cent
now.
Not only securities have had a disappointing year in the UK. The feel-bad
factor has extended to housing, which has flattened out after a reasonably
promising spring-time rally. I was right to say in January that it was a
good moment to switch from the stock market into houses; but my forecast
late in 1993 that house prices would rise by up to 5 per cent over the next
year (which seemed cautious at the time) has been undermined by recent
setbacks. By November, house prices nationally were fractionally lower,
year-on-year.
Such house price weakness reflects the peculiar nature of the 1994 economic
recovery: a strong corporate sector has been driven by exports and healthy
flows through the capital markets, but consumers are restrained by job
insecurity, weak post-tax income growth, and a reluctance to increase their
debts.
Where, indeed, are the borrowers?
The banks and building societies have been confronted with major structural
challenges in 1994 - symptomised by the past year's mere 4 per cent growth
in broad money. This was the recovery that passed by the banks and house
prices, which depend traditionally for their strength upon voluminous
injections of mortgage finance, have languished.
This has been growth without a consumer spending spree and without a
borrowing binge. It is, of course, all thoroughly healthy. But so, they say,
is castor oil.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Sony and Philips braced for battle with video-CD rival
</HEADLINE>

Sony and Philips, two of the world's largest consumer electronics groups,
yesterday fired the opening salvo in the battle to specify the format for
the next generation of compact discs, which will play films as well as
music.
The electronics industry has for years been developing a more sophisticated
version of the audio-CD, which would replace the video cassette and provide
some of the data storage capacity of interactive CD-ROM discs. The new discs
will be played on special machines, which will also play audio-CDs.
Sony and Philips, which liaised successfully to launch the original audio-CD
in 1982, are anxious that their proposed format should become the industry
standard, thereby enabling them to earn royalties from licensing the
technology to other companies.
They face strong opposition from Toshiba, the Japanese electronics company
which has designed its own disc format in conjunction with the Time Warner
entertainment group.
The rivalry raises the threat of a repetition of the 'video war' in the
1980s when Sony lost a battle to impose Betamax as the standard format for
video cassettes against the VHS format devised by the Matsushita group.
An early version of the discs with video capacity, or 'video-CDs', is
already available in Japan. They have had limited success as they only run
for 72 minutes (the same as audio-CDs) and are therefore unsuitable for
feature films, which have a minimum length of 90 minutes.
Some companies, including Philips, have addressed this problem by developing
multi-disc players, which can play films or operas by running from one disc
to another. However, multi-disc is seen as an interim solution, before the
industry moves on to more advanced CDs.
The format proposed by Sony and Philips is for a 12cm-wide disc (the same
size as an audio-CD) with the capacity to store five times more data. It
will play 135 minutes of video, enough for most feature films.
Sony claims that its new format offers 'superior' visual quality to video
cassettes and sound 'at least as good as audio-CD'. It says that production
costs will be 'reasonable', as it can use its existing capacity to
manufacture the new hardware and discs.
However, next month Toshiba plans to launch the prototype of a disc that can
store data on both sides and up to 270 minutes of video. It claims it offers
superior visual images to the Sony format.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Russian general refuses to fight Chechen rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GROZNY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Growing opposition among senior Russian military officers to the invasion of
Chechnya reached the front line yesterday when General Ivan Babichev,
commander of one of the three divisions sent into the breakaway republic,
refused to continue fighting.
His statement, made to a crowd of Chechen villagers, directly flouted the
orders of President Boris Yeltsin. It is the most damaging blow the Russian
administration has suffered since the Chechen crisis began, and signals a
dangerously mutinous mood within the officer corps.
In Moscow, it was reported that Mr Yeltsin would chair a meeting today of
the country's security council which would discuss the crisis and consider
what action, if any, to take against the recalcitrant general. Mr Yeltsin
has given Chechens until midnight tonight to hand over their arms or face a
military crackdown.
Gen Babichev, addressing several hundred Chechens near his division, 35
miles west of the capital Grozny, said that 'the Russian leaders can condemn
us but we are not going to shoot. We are not going to use our tanks against
the people'.
His is the westernmost of three divisions sent to Chechnya last Sunday - and
one which has appeared demoralised before the resistance it met in the
neighbouring republic of Ingushetia.
Only the northern division, reportedly joined by units of the eastern
division, has reached positions near Grozny. Chechen fighters were saying
yesterday that villagers had with some success appealed to its soldiers not
to fight.
Gen Babichev, in defying his orders, has joined calls made by the other
top-level military refuseniks - General Boris Gromov, deputy defence
minister, and General Alexander Lebed, the popular commander of the 14th
Army. This week they criticised the intervention, with Gen Lebed saying
Russia risked 'getting involved in a war with the entire Moslem world'.
However, Gen Babichev's statements are more damaging to Moscow's political
authority as they come from an officer in the field. They also give a
publicity and morale boost to the leadership of General Dzhokar Dudayev, the
Chechen president.
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, said yesterday he was
ready to meet Gen Dudayev. Gen Dudayev repeated his readiness for talks 'at
the highest political level'.
Though most firing had stopped in Grozny last night and the Chechen fighters
had been ordered to disengage and pull back, both sides continue to threaten
all-out war.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Warburg hits out at Morgan Stanley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recriminations broke out yesterday after the collapse of merger talks
between the investment banks Morgan Stanley and SG Warburg. The dispute
emerged as Warburg insisted that it did not intend to merge with another
bank.
Sir David Scholey, Warburg's chairman, accused a Morgan Stanley executive of
composing 'a subjective and selective alibi' by claiming that the US firm's
motive for a merger was to gain control of Warburg's fund management arm,
Mercury Asset Management.
Speaking publicly for the first time about the merger attempt, Sir David
said he believed the Morgan Stanley director's motive was to minimise
publicly the setback to the US firm, and to reassure its 2,300 staff in
Europe.
'I cannot say that I feel miffed because they have a hell of a containment
job to do,' said Sir David, commenting on remarks made to the FT by Mr
Stephen Waters, co-managing director of Morgan Stanley Europe.
Sir David said it was 'not our natural way to charge into the attack and say
all the self-justifying things we might do' after such an incident, but he
believed Morgan Stanley wanted a true investment banking merger. He said
that when he read Mr Waters' remarks, 'I thought to myself, what a pity, but
he presumably has his own imperatives for saying it'.
Warburg would not now seek another merger because Morgan Stanley had been
the best fit. It would resume its strategy of building an independent bank.
Sir David said it had gained from merger discussions and he denied that
Warburg had been weakened by the incident.
The merger discussions broke down on Thursday over demands by Mercury Asset
Management that it would maintain operational independence in the merged
bank. That was rejected by Morgan Stanley. Warburg shares closed 14p up at
713p.

FT  17 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Share consolidations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Share capital consolidations have accompanied both the special dividend
payouts made by regional electricity companies - first East Midlands and now
Yorkshire. The effect of the measure is to reduce the number of shares in
issue, thus mimicking the effect of the share buy-backs which have been
another popular way for the companies to slough off surplus cash.
The chief reason given for the measure is a little odd: it is designed to
ensure that the share price moves back to where it would have been had there
been no special dividend in the first place. But a fall in the share price
after the payout is announced is nothing to worry out, unless it is for more
than the value of the dividend: it is a simple arithmetical adjustment to
take account of the outflow of resources from the group.
That companies go to the trouble of making the change implies limited faith
in shareholders' intelligence. Total return should be the main investment
yardstick, and that is the combination of the dividend and the share price.
It also shows scepticism about investors' ability to make comparisons
between the performance of companies in the same sector. True, all the
regional electricity companies had the same share price when they were
privatised. But they had different yields. So a simple comparison of share
prices is specious.
By contrast, share capital consolidations may prove useful when companies
seek to raise capital from shareholders, rather than as a cosmetic adjunct
to giving it back. There is a dearth of deep-discounted rights issues, even
though these eliminate the need for costly underwriting. This may be because
companies fear shareholders' reactions to the reduced share price and
dividend which can follow such issues. The falls in price and dividends are
technical in nature. But they could be avoided altogether if companies
consolidated their capital as part of the rights issue process.

FT  17 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After a long phoney war, the real battle for the hearts of 15m cross-Channel
ferry passengers has begun. Eurotunnel shares rose 6 per cent on news of an
impending revenue stream from Le Shuttle, even though the latest delay means
yet another official revenue forecast will not be met.
Le Shuttle's pricing is much lower than the low-season prices Eurotunnel
announced last January. But the difference cannot be interpreted as the
start of a price war. Earlier rates did not stretch beyond 1994.
Nevertheless, the move does dash earlier indications that Eurotunnel could
charge a premium for its 'premium' ser-vice.
Eurotunnel's true intentions on competition will only emerge when it unveils
pricing plans for the summer, which accounts for two-thirds of ferry company
profits. The tunnel's fixed costs - not least interest charges - are
enormous, whereas variable costs are low. That means it is imperative to
maximise passenger volumes. Beyond a certain point, additional passengers
represent almost pure profit whatever the ticket price.
Of course, nobody wants a price war. Short-haul profits at P&amp;O, the largest
competitor, are forecast to drop to less than half the Pounds 65m estimated
for this year. P&amp;O could float its capacity elsewhere, as Eurotunnel must
hope. But it is not going to give up its revenues willingly.
Recent performance on freight suggests a potentially friendly outcome. P&amp;O's
freight traffic increased by 30 per cent in the 10 months to October.
Eurotunnel started competitive freight operations in May, but has hit its
stated target of 1,000 lorries a day without price cuts.
However, Eurotunnel has little margin for error, as Le Shuttle revenues must
finance Pounds 8bn of debt. By 1996, Le Shuttle should be carrying half the
car and coach passengers currently crossing the Channel by ferry. Any
shortfall will probably provoke price cuts and the spectre of yet another
financial restructuring. The tunnel now has to progress from forecasts to
hard numbers. Until it does, caution should prevail.

FT  17 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Democratic societies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has bought the line that building societies will become more
accountable if voting rights are given to ordinary depositors. This faith in
building society democracy is touching but naive. Millions of society
members already possess the vote but can rarely be bothered to use it.
Inflating their ranks will merely increase the number of wasted votes.
Instead of extending voting rights, the government should define clearly
members' economic rights. At present, these rights are fuzzy. Members
collectively own the societies' assets. But the legal framework does not
specify how these assets should be distributed among individual members.
This vagueness most obviously has drawbacks if a society is taken over or
acquired. Should its value be divided among members on a flat-rate basis, in
proportion to their savings or according to number of years they have saved
with the society? There is no clear answer. Not surprisingly, there is
grumbling over who receives the spoils, as shown in Lloyds Bank's bid for
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester. The planned Halifax-Leeds merger may provoke
similar disgruntlement.
Clear economic rights could also improve accountability. If members had
identifiable financial interests, there would be greater point in using
their votes. There are several ways of doing this. One would be to pay
members' dividends reflecting their society's performance, as if they owned
equity in an ordinary company. An alternative would be to pay higher
interest rates - with the portion attributable to financial performance
clearly earmarked.
Spelling out economic rights in this way would also clear up the widespread
confusion over who is a member and who is not.
Such a reform would not merely give substance to the idea of building
society democracy. There would be broader economic benefits given the
billions of pounds of capital tied up in the movement. Societies' positive
image in the high street may give the impression that they are performing
well. In fact, their managements are often sleepy. Many only perform
tolerably well because they are sitting on vast inherited capital bases on
which no dividends are paid.

Management, which is 75 per cent owned by Warburg, that it would maintain
operational independence in the merged bank. That was rejected by Morgan

MAM's board, advised by the merchant bank Lazard Brothers, also wanted a
significant premium to be offered to minority shareholders to buy out their
stake. That might have involved an offer of about Pounds 400m for the
minority stake.
Sir David said relations with MAM would be unaffected by the incident, and
Warburg wanted it to maintain independence.
Warburg shares closed 14p up at 713p, although they reached a peak of 735p
earlier on speculation about a possible takeover bid for the investment
bank.

FT  17 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Triple witching brings surge
in Dow

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US equities surged in extremely heavy volume as investors covered short
positions during the afternoon's 'triple-witching' when options and futures
on stock indices expired in the last hour of trading, writes Lisa Bransten
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 41.72 stronger at 3,807.19, while
the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 registered an advance of 3.46
at 458.80, but the Nasdaq composite declined 1.61 to 729.07. Trading volume
on the New York SE reached 479m shares.
The market bounced back to levels not seen since before its mid-November
nosedive, with the Dow recovering more than 3 per cent of its value over the
course of the week.
Volume for the day was the third highest in the history of the NYSE. Trading
activity was greater only on the two days surrounding the market crash in
October 1987 when turnover surpassed 600m shares.
Neither the stock nor the bond markets reacted sharply to data showing an
unexpectedly large increase in housing starts for November. Construction of
private housing grew by 6.9 per cent last month, against economists'
forecasts closer to 2.0 per cent.
The bond market was mixed in quiet trading, with the long bond outperforming
the two-year note and helping the yield curve keep its relatively steep
slope. The curve had flattened since mid-November, reflecting investor
sentiment that the economy would slow.
Analysts had attributed recent flattening to the prospect that the Federal
Reserve would lift interest rates again at the December 20 meeting of its
open market committee.
The release of relatively mild economic news earlier this week, however, led
investors to believe that another tightening was unlikely, causing a
steepening of the yield curve and a rally in the stock market.
Shares in US airlines were mostly down in the morning after a spate of
separate incidents raised safety questions, although several bounced back
with the market.
Fears were already high in the wake of two recent crashes of American Eagle
planes. Late on Wednesday the commuter airline cancelled all flights out of
Chicago after pilots claimed that they were not adequately trained to fly in
cold weather.
Meanwhile, Tower Air acknowledged that several of its aircraft had been
sabotaged, and the privately held Kiwi Airlines was grounded after it was
unable to provide regulators with documentation that its pilots had received
sufficient training.
Tower Air was unchanged at Dollars 8 5/8 , Southwest Airlines shed Dollars
1/2 to Dollars 16 1/8 and Continental Airlines eased Dollars 1/8 to Dollars
7 3/4 . AMR, parent of American Airlines, gained Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 50
5/8 and UAL, parent of United Airlines, put on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 87
5/8 . USAir Group, which has lost about 65 per cent of its value since the
start of the year, was up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 4 5/8 .
Canada
Base metal issues were the stars and precious metal shares the weak
performers as the Toronto market mainly failed to find direction yesterday
amid the turbulent state of play on Wall Street caused by the
triple-witching expirations.
The TSE 300 index was flat for most of the day before ending a slight 6.30
up at 4,118.03, making a gain of 83.7 points on the week. Rises outscored
falls by 414 to 364 after volume of 61m shares. The golds group dropped 1.88
per cent. Brazil
Shares in Sao Paulo closed 1.5 per cent up in nervous trade after players
put final touches to their strategies ahead of Monday's options market
settlement. The Bovespa index rose 750 to 49,177, and turnover was high at
RDollars 377m (Dollars 444m) as a number of institutional investors reversed
some box operations, a combination of two call and two put options.
Analysts said the market's medium and long-term scenario remained positive
and did not discount the possibility of a bullish trend after Monday's
settlement. Lower nominal domestic interest rates, following falling
inflation forecasts, were also expected to continue bolstering prices.

FT  17 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan rises in calm before
expected storm
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy had its own agenda yesterday. But where equity markets were strong, as
in New York, London, and Frankfurt, they were accompanied mostly by the
expiry of futures and options contracts, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN took advantage of the relative political calm to move higher again,
ahead of next week's expected storm when Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime
minister, faces a confidence vote that could topple him from power.
The Comit index rose 13.94 or 2.4 per cent to 605.77, up 0.7 per cent on the
week, dealers reporting a further awakening of foreign demand.
The banks remained in focus. Credito Romagnolo was L537 higher at L18,884 in
response to the Cariplo's counter-bid. Credito Italiano rose L24 to L1,645
and BCI was L50 up at L3,331 amid speculation that the two might launch a
joint offer for Rolo.
Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura rose L265 or 10 per cent to L2,909 on
renewed speculation about a shake-up in its shareholder structure.
Telecoms were supported by ministerial approval of some concessions on
tariffs and fees charged by the state for its lines. Telecom Italia moved
ahead L121 to L3,883 and Stet L61 to L4,385.
Fiat rose L209 or 3.8 per cent to L5,707 after the company said that its
results to October 31 and forecasts for the full year were continuing to
show signs of improvement.
James Capel, which upgraded the stock to a buy this week, commented that
since July there had been a marked improvement in both the Italian car
market and Fiat's position within it. The company was also making progress
in other major European markets and was performing exceptionally well in
Latin America.
PARIS failed to build on early gains as the little momentum that was evident
during the morning petered out after lunch. The CAC-40 index slipped 6.94 to
1,924.16, a fall of 0.6 per cent on the week.
Peugeot, down FFr22 or 3 per cent at FFr725, but off a session's low of
FFr720, was hit by a big sell order in reaction to comments from the company
on Thursday that seemed to suggest that second-half results would show only
a small improvement over the first six months.
But, said Mr Christopher Will of Lehman Brothers, the picture could be quite
different; he said the group's sales have been holding up extremely well
during December, after a strong performance in November, and he believed his
full-year earnings target of FFr2.5bn, following a first-half FFr688m, was
on line.
Hoare Govett downgraded Moulinex, off 3 per cent at FFr101.30, from buy to
sell on the expectation that its earnings recovery will take longer than
expected. The electrical appliance manufacturer reported a higher half-year
loss on Thursday.
AMSTERDAM's derivatives expiry passed quietly and the AEX index rose 0.69 to
408.38, up 0.5 per cent on the week.
KPN added Fl 1.10 at Fl 57.80, bringing its gain on the week to 6.25 per
cent following the announcement that Unisource, in which the Dutch telecoms
group has a stake, is to link up with AT&amp;T, of the US.
ZURICH saw further demand for blue chips which took the SMI index 6.7 higher
to 2,604.7, for a 1.1 per cent rise on the week. The financial sector
remained focused on CS Holding and Swiss Re after Thursday's announcement of
an alliance to develop financial derivatives on reinsurance. CS Holding rose
SFr17 to SFr546, with some investors said to be switching out of Swiss Re
into the bank. Swiss Re gave up much of Thursday's advance, easing SFr7 to
SFr787.
Cyclicals remained volatile, with BBC declining SFr5 to SFr1,096, while
Sulzer lost SFr10 to SFr866. Fischer recovered after Thursday's fall with a
rise of SFr30 to SFr1,530.
Landis &amp; Gyr, still supported by Wednesday's better than expected full-year
results, put on SFr9 at SFr804.
BRUSSELS saw the Bel-20 index rise 10.61 to 1,394.44, a fraction higher on
the week, as dealers took positions at the start of the two-week trading
account. Cockerill added BFr5 at BFr205 ahead of its Bel-20 debut on Monday,
and business in Union Miniere was lifted by block trades as the shares rose
BFr50 to BFr2,510.
COPENHAGEN fell, the KFX index losing 1.17 to 91.54. Sophus Berendsen, the
holding company which owns Rentokil, of the UK, dropped DKr22 or 4.5 per
cent to DKr470 after Thursday's revelation that divestment losses in 1994,
at DKr158m, would be some DKr60m higher than expected after the sale of a US
engineering unit.

FT  17 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Late rally lifts Nikkei
as region slows
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A late rally lifted the Nikkei index to a slightly higher finish, but the
total market was marginally off in declining volume as arbitrage buying
continued to set the tone, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
The 225 average, after spending much of the day on the minus side, climbed
by nearly 150 points in the final hour of trading to close at the session's
high of 19,163.43, up 42.31, its third rise in as many days and a percentage
point higher on the week. The day's low was 19,012.10.
However, volume shrank to an estimated 230m shares from Thursday's 287m and
the broader market was sluggish. Declining issues outnumbered advances by
502 to 466, with 205 stocks flat. The Topix index of all first-section
stocks eased 0.19 to 1,508.60 and the capital-weighted Nikkei 300 was off
0.04 at 279.04. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 0.78 at 1,259.39.
Arbitrageurs bought stocks underlying the Nikkei 225 average after futures
prices were pumped up by dealers.
Large-capital issues were mixed. Steelmakers shed some of Thursday's gains.
Nippon Steel, the day's most active stock, lost Y8 at Y355, Kawasaki slipped
Y5 to Y400 and Kobe dipped Y2 to Y303. Shipbuilders added to Thursday's
rises. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries moved up Y5 to Y728 and Kawasaki Heavy Y4
to Y446.
Japan Tobacco cut a two-day rally short, declining Y7,000 to Y908,000, and
NTT fell Y7,000 to Y841,000. East Japan Railway recovered Y1,000 to
Y468,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 21.12 to 20,830.34 in volume of 124.8m
shares.
Roundup
Wall Street's overnight gain helped sentiment.
HONG KONG encountered profit-taking in a thin market. The Hang Seng index
was off 93.17 or 1.1 per cent at 8,166.39, after hitting a low of 8,141.16,
leaving a 4.8 per cent rise on the week. Turnover was a provisional
HKDollars 2.9bn, against HKDollars 3.7bn for Thursday. HSBC fell HKDollars
1.50 to HKDollars 82.50.
The H-share index of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong rose 3.80 to
1,080.93.
SEOUL was lifted by broadly based buying and ended higher for the third
consecutive session. The composite index added 8.89 at 1,036.76, but was
unchanged on the week.
Brokers said that smaller-capitalisation shares, which had fallen sharply in
recent days, staged a technical rebound, while blue chips continued to post
moderate gains.
Korea Mobile Telecom closed limit up for the third day, rising Won10,000 to
Won455,000. Samsung Electronics put on Won1,000 at Won114,000.
MANILA's gain was influenced by the rise on Wall Street, with the composite
index climbing 29.14 to 2,708.99, bringing the week's improvement to 4 per
cent.
Southeast Asia Cement Holdings, listed on Wednesday, was the week's top
performer, rising 28 per cent to 1.92 pesos from its offer price of 1.50.
KUALA LUMPUR finished a choppy session lower, with falls in Telekom Malaysia
and Tenaga Nasional dragging the composite index down 4.17 to 946.60. The
index gained 4 per cent over the week.
Telekom fell 40 cents to MDollars 16.60 and Tenaga lost 20 cents at MDollars
10.20.
SYDNEY ended slightly higher after late profit-taking eroded initial gains.
The All Ordinaries index was up 2.0 at 1,897.0, for a 2.5 per cent rise on
the week.
BHP advanced 12 cents to ADollars 19.12 after reporting improved six-month
results.
BANGKOK chalked up a further 2 per cent gain, the SET index closing 26.47
stronger at 1,336.47, higher by 4.5 per cent on the week, in a rally led by
finance and banking counters. Turnover expanded from Bt6.2bn to Bt7.9bn. The
finance and banking sectors both rose by 2.3 per cent.
BOMBAY saw moderate buying interest from domestic mutual funds, and the BSE
30-share index rose 39.76 to 3,943.65. This was still 0.6 per cent lower on
the week, although brokers argued that there had been an overreaction to the
Congress rout in regional polls earlier in the week, when the index fell by
more than 135 points.

FT  17 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Financials lead decline in German share
prices - But there are recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German stock market has moved sideways and back this year, but analysts
have hopes for 1995 as the economy continues to recover - supported by
exports rather than consumer spending - and interest rates stabilise on bond
markets.
The biggest market losers of 1994 have been bank and insurance stocks. This
is where the sharp rise in bond yields has hit hardest, as shown by the
latest set of fairly dismal results from the big banks. The investment
portfolios of insurance companies will also show the effects of securities
write-downs necessitated by weaker bond prices.
Of the top five stocks in the Dax index of 30 leading shares, two are from
the banking and insurance sector. The biggest component in the index,
Allianz - Europe's largest insurance concern - accounts for about 11 per
cent of the Dax capitalisation.
Many investors buy Allianz as a proxy for the German market, since nearly 70
per cent of its total investment portfolio of more than DM200bn is invested
in German companies; it owns sizeable minority stakes in companies such as
BASF, Dresdner Bank and Veba. But investors in German insurance stocks have
not had the brightest of years. According to Commerzbank, the sector at
mid-week was down by nearly 20 per cent this year. Allianz's shares had
fallen by 18 per cent to around DM2,420.
The banks had not fared much better, with an overall fall of around 16 per
cent. The big three Frankfurt-based banks - Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and
Commerzbank - have just reported falls of between 15 per cent and 27 per
cent in their 10-month operating profits. Deutsche and Dresdner are also in
the Dax top 10.
Showing the smallest declines, in a stock market year which Commerzbank
described as disappointing, were chemicals, engineering, steel and energy
shares. These have clearly benefited from the economy's faster than expected
recovery. The worst performer was the department store sector, which is
hardly surprising since German 1994 retail sales are likely to be down for
the first time since records began in 1965.
Nor is 1995, a year of renewed income tax surcharges to help pay for
reunification, expected to bring much improvement on the consumer side. One
foreign bank which holds a different view, however, is Societe Generale. 'We
think that household consumption is likely to bring some good news in the
second half of this year,' says the French bank in its latest strategy
report.
In support of its case it cites the upturn in the consumer confidence index
produced by the Munich-based Ifo economic research institute. The bank
recommends Kaufhof as its preferred department store stock in continental
Europe, although other analysts have downgraded their earnings estimates for
the company in view of the sluggish retail scene.
For the German market overall, Societe Generale is not too optimistic. It
has increased the market's weighting in its international portfolio strategy
to neutral from underweight. On the positive side, it points out the virtues
of political stability after October's narrow general election victory of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and of economic recovery. On the minus side, it still
regards the German market as expensive in spite of its decline this year,
and as relatively over-exposed to the risk of a US downturn late in 1995.
Commerzbank takes a more positive line. Its analysts expect the Dax to move
up to around 2,400 - a rise of at least 15 per cent over the current level -
on the back of further improvements in corporate earnings and more stable
bond markets. This year to date it has shed nearly 9 per cent to around
2,070, after gaining 48 per cent in 1993.
The bank reckons on average earnings growth of nearly 30 per cent next year,
led by industrial companies, after a similar outcome in 1994. Further profit
rises in 1996 are also on the cards, with the corporate earnings peak likely
to be reached a year later.
Mr Ingo Mainert of Commerzbank's equities team favours shares of big
chemical companies, which have been producing sharp profit rises, and banks,
now in a position to benefit from a more favourable interest rate climate
and the economic upswing.
Analysts at Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst also favour construction stocks as
likely to profit from future growth in European economies. Its overall
stance is more cautious, however. The bank advises investors to be
'increasingly defensive'. It sees risks for the strength of the economic
upturn in the behaviour of consumers and in the limited ability of companies
to increase profit margins.
Making the point that the German stock market does not represent the German
economy very effectively - much of manufacturing and service industry is in
private hands - Kleinwort Benson expects a 'not hugely inspiring' 1995, with
the Dax pushing above 2,300 towards the year-end.
Mr Glen Liddy, a German market analyst at the UK bank, favours blue chip
capital goods and chemical companies, as well as banks. But he says the
German market does not have enough consumer-oriented stocks, such as Wella
(haircare), to take advantage of international spending power.

FT  17 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs spark up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bid speculation drove the utilities forward, with the latest twist being
talk that some leading regional electricity companies (recs) may seek to
protect themselves by bidding for water companies. The government's golden
share in the water companies expires at the end of this year.
Meanwhile, Yorkshire Electricity took the market by surprise with the timing
of a special 90p dividend. Market watchers had predicted that the
distributor would follow East Midlands Electricity in paying a special
dividend, but the move was not expected until some time in the new year.
The group also reported a 32 per cent increase in half-time profits to
Pounds 97.6m and a 15 per cent rise in the dividend. The shares climbed 30
to 687p ex-dividend. Mr Nigel Hawkins at Hoare Govett said: 'Yorkshire's
sector rating is likely to improve following the reassertion of shareholder
value and impressive interim results.'
Yorkshire has been mentioned as a possible 'white knight' for Northern
Electric, for which Trafalgar House has said it is considering a bid, but
several brokers said the group could itself be a bid target. US broker
Salomon Brothers was said to have taken this view.
East Midlands, which reports figures on Monday, gained 12 at 810p, and
Northern finished a penny ahead at 985p. Trafalgar edged  1/2 forward to
74p.
Merchant bank SG Warburg recovered from the shock of rejection as the market
looked ahead to the next contender to replace Morgan Stanley, of the US.
The US investment bank was not prepared to pay above the odds for Mercury
Asset Management (MAM), Warburg's 75 per cent-owned fund arm. And after the
market closed yesterday, Warburg said it was not soliciting other
approaches. However, analysts are convinced that change will come, and while
the shares were off their best by the close they were still up 14 at 713p.
MAM, revealed as the ambition of Morgan Stanley's affections, jumped 46 to
724p.
Insurance issues, which are big investors in equities and thus geared to
outperform a rising market, moved ahead sharply. They were further boosted
by an enthusiastic recommendation and the hope factor now in the FT-SE 100.
Credit Lyonnais Laing removed its cautious stance on the sector in a note
published yesterday. Specifically it took Sun Alliance off the sell list and
the stock rose 8 to 307p.
Laing's change of heart is part of a market-wide review of the sector that
concentrates on recent slides in the stocks rather than fundamental
considerations. Earlier in the week UBS argued that the sector was
undervalued and focused on General Accident. Yesterday GenAcc, helped by
pressure from short positions in the market, rose 22 to 531p. Commercial
Union moved forward 17 to 527p.
News of Vickers' choice of partner for its Rolls-Royce Motor Cars division
could emerge early next week following a meeting between the company
analysts on Monday. Vickers was unchanged at 177p in nominal turnover.
Best bets in the City point to a straight race between the two German
groups, BMW and Daimler-Benz. The former has existing links with
Rolls-Royce, but on Friday the informed money was leaning more towards
Daimler.
Caradon was the star of the construction sectors, surging 14 to 254p in 2.7m
turnover following the recent buy recommendation from UBS. The stock has
rebounded almost 10 per cent this week.
Barratt Developments and Beazer kept the recent recovery in the
housebuilders ticking over, with Barratt up 6 at 156p, and Beazer adding 2
1/2 at 131p in 2.4m turnover.
Oil majors BP and Shell Transport rose on heavy turnover that reflected the
expiry of the FT-SE 100 December contract. The removal of pressure in the
derivatives market sent BP 7 higher to 421 1/2 p with 20m traded and Shell
up 9 1/2 to 691p on turnover of 11m.
However, the most heavily traded stock of the day was British Gas, the
shares ignoring popular criticism over the company's disparate pay policy
and rising 2 1/2 to 307 1/2 p with 21m shares changing hands.
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel bounced 15 to 273p on optimism over the
car shuttle service, which was priced yesterday.
Boosted by early morning futures activity, the heavily traded telecoms
sector notched up big volumes but limited price movements. BT traded 15m
shares to rise 3 1/2 to 376p and Cable and Wireless added 6 1/2 at 361 1/2 p
in 8m turnover. Vodafone was 2 1/2 higher at 200p in 8.9m volume.
Land Securities jumped 22 to 586p after announcing the Pounds 76.5m sale of
the lease on the Milton Gate building in London. The sale was to AP Fonden,
the national Swedish pension fund.
News of a 49 per cent acquisition in a Mexican sugar cane business saw
shares in Tate &amp; Lyle harden 7 to 418p.
Shares in Dixons eased 1 1/2 to 177 1/2p in trade of 2.9m as the market
digested the Office of Fair Trading's report into the sale of extended
warranties on electrical goods.

FT  17 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Imigran talk hits Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo failed to benefit from yesterday's market rally
as a letter in one medical journal over one of its key drugs lowered the
temperature.
The Lancet letter related to Imigran, the anti-migraine treatment. It
examined data that had been discussed before and did little more than
continue an academic debate.
But it came at a time when the leading pharmaceuticals companies are
awaiting approval for some of their products in the US - the Food and Drug
Administration tends to try and clear its books at the end of the year.
Glaxo could win long-awaited approval for an oral version of Imigran.
The shares were off 10 at worst, but there was reassurance from some more
seasoned analysts, combined with news of a senior company appointment, that
aided sentiment - Glaxo said it had appointed Dr James Niedel as its global
research and development director. An additional boost from US buying late
in the afternoon helped the stock to finish only 3 lower on the day at 626p.
Turnover reached a heavy 13m shares.

FT  17 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures moved ahead strongly, with the premium to the cash
market widening dramatically once the December contract had expired at
10.30am, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 March contract was at 3,043 at the close of pit trading, up 49
points. The premium to cash equities was 30 points, or 12 points above the
middle range of brokers' estimates of fair value.
To some extent the future was bouncing off the uncertainty created by the
expiry of the December counter, but activity was low.

FT  17 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE surges through 3,000 after
futures expiry - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT-SE 100 Index, which at the start of last week hit a five-month low,
rallied with a vengeance yesterday, bursting through the 3,000 level and
shrugging aside the government's hammering in the Dudley West by-election.
The main driving force came from the futures market, where the FT-SE 100
December future expired in mid-morning and was followed by a surge of buying
interest from investors keen to take a position in the market for the new
year.
Aiding the market's strongly positive tone throughout a busy afternoon
session was another buoyant showing by Wall Street,where the Dow was up
around 20 points shortly after the opening of trading.
The buying in the UK equity market was spread across the whole spectrum,
with second-line stocks aggressively bid up from the outset and closing
around the day's highs, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index finally resting 23.2 up at
3,437.1. Over the week the Mid 250 has risen 41.3, or 1.3 per cent.
The FT-SE 100 moved in a 60-point arc, dropping 20 points at the opening
before spiralling upwards in the wake of the December future's expiry to end
a net 40.2 ahead at 3,013.6. Over the week the index gained 36.3, or 1.2 per
cent.
The market's resurgence coincided with another relatively high level of
turnover in equities. Some 693.6m shares changed hands yesterday, with the
top 350 stocks accounting for well over half that figure, well above recent
levels of activity. Customer business in the market on Thursday was Pounds
1.18bn.
Dealers said the market was always going to open lower, with some market
operators said to be keen to see the December FT-SE future expire below the
2,970 level.
And even some of the market's more hard-bitten traders were surprised at the
extent of the rout of the Conservatives in the Dudley West by-election,
which produced one of the worst results for the Tories for more than 50
years.
The FT-SE 100, after opening 5.5 points off, fell to a day's low of 2,953.2,
down 20.2, within the first half-hour of trading and was down some 7 points
prior to the expiry of the December future.
Within minutes of the expiry the market embarked on a determined rally, led
by some of the current bid favourites. The rise gathered pace for the rest
of the session, and all the major indices closed at or around the day's best
levels.
'Triple-witching hour' in the US was said to have gone off without a hitch
and markets across Europe drew further strength from Wall Street's latest
show of strength, which occurred in spite of higher than expected housing
starts. The Dow has now risen in excess of 80 points over the past five
sessions.
Dealers also pointed out that the market had effectively ruled out the
chances of another interest rate rise in the US after the Federal Open
Market Committee meeting next Tuesday.
Marketmakers at the big London trading houses said there was now a strong
expectation of a good performance in the short term; '3,100 by December 31
is achievable,' said one head of marketmaking. But he cautioned that the
market had to keep a weather eye on the political situation in the UK.
The utilities areas continued to provide much of the excitement in the
market. Yorkshire Electricity announced a 90p a share 'special dividend'.
And there was a growing feeling in the utilities that the expected burst of
merger activity in the recs/waters could very well see some of the recs
launch takeovers/mergers in the waters as 'poison pills' to ward off bids in
the sector. Swiss Bank Corp, which was said to have been accumulating stock
in Northern Electric prior to this week's announcement that Trafalgar House
may bid for the utility, was reported to have been an aggressive buyer of
the electricity sector.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Sterling steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling was yesterday left unmoved by the ruling Conservative party's
massive defeat in the Dudley West by-election, writes Philip Gawith.
A poor showing by the government had been so widely discounted as to be of
negligible impact. The pound actually finished the day in London slightly
firmer, at DM2.4561 from DM2.4542, and at Dollars 1.563 from Dollars 1.5615.
For the most part, foreign exchanges were lost in a deep pre-Christmas
slumber. There was little currency movement of note, and volumes were in
some cases so low as to be derisory.
The Irish punt showed no reaction to the formation of a new government, and
in America the dollar was unresponsive to President Clinton's address in
which he promised Dollars 60bn in tax cuts over five years. It ended barely
changed at DM1.5714 and Y100.15. In New York the dollar finished at DM1.5727
and Y100.225.
In Europe, Mr Jacques Santer, incoming president of the European Commission,
said the Community would have failed if it had not achieved monetary union
by 1999. He said he hoped to achieve the third phase of monetary union by
1997.
The Irish punt showed almost no reaction to the formation of the new
government, resolving a month of political uncertainty. It finished at
IPounds 1.0164 against sterling, from IPounds 1.016.
Mr Jim Power, senior economist at the Bank of Ireland in Dublin, said:
'There is nothing in the programme of this government that could disturb
financial markets. The biggest threat on the interest rate front will be
when the UK next raises rates.'
The incoming government bolstered sentiment by pledging adherence to the
Maastricht convergence criteria.
Mr Power noted that the punt is not a heavily traded currency. 'Most of the
business is customer driven. Virtually no-one takes speculative positions in
the currency.'
The markets' apathetic response to the UK by-election result was explained
by Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC. 'To the extent that the
by-election defeat merely reflected expectations, it had no currency
impact.'
Some observers believe that President Clinton's tax plans could help the
dollar. They reason that the corollary of fiscal relaxation will be higher
interest rates in the current cycle, which should help the dollar.
In their fortnightly survey, the financial consultancy IDEA found that
respondents 'remained dollar bullish, but suggested on the whole that any
reasonable rally would wait until after the turn of the year'. On a
two-month outlook, respondents saw the dollar reaching DM1.59 and Y102.
Traders continue to watch the lira closely. Italian Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi has confirmed that there will be a vote of confidence next week,
which he could well lose.
Fanning the flames yesterday was Mr Umberto Bossi, head of the Northern
League, and member of the coalition government. He said he expected a change
of government in the new year.
The market remains confused about the implications. In the same IDEA survey,
the lira was a popular choice both as best and worst European currency in
1995. Respondents were more positive about sterling, with a net 20 per cent
looking for a bullish return.
The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 1.1bn money market shortage, at
established rates, in its daily operations.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Copper falters at 5-year
high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Metal Exchange copper market yesterday tried the air above the
Dollars 3,000-a-tonne mark and found it a little too thin.
A strong recovery following a severe shake-out early in the week carried the
three months delivery price to a 5 1/4 -year high of Dollars 3,005 in the
morning; but by the close it had been pared back to Dollars 2,985.50 up
Dollars 6 on the day and Dollars 48 on the week. That price was Dollars
107.50 above the low reached on Tuesday.
An important factor in the market's renewed strength was concern about
nearby supply tightness, which also resulted in a widening in the
'backwardation'  - the premium for immediate delivery  - against the three
months price to Dollars 80 at one point from Dollars 50 at Tuesday's close.
Traders said there was nervousness in the market ahead of next week's 'third
Wednesday' option declarations.
In spite of yesterday afternoon's retracement most dealers remained
confident that a decisive break above Dollars 3,000 would come soon.
'Copper's fundamentals are strong and a 3.6 per cent growth in 1995 western
consumption is forecast to cut stocks to five weeks supply by the end of the
year,' said the Economist Intelligence Unit in its monthly World Commodity
Forecasts, published yesterday. It said that pointed to a 26 per cent rise
in the year's average price compared with the 1994 average.
The EIU report was also bullish about the outlook for the other five base
metals traded at the LME.
It forecast that falls in western world production of aluminium and in
imports from the former eastern bloc, plus a further 'healthy' rise in
consumption, would lead to a 19 per cent increase in the price average for
that metal.
This week aluminium, like the other metals, shadowed movements in the copper
market. It bottomed on Tuesday at Dollars 1,815 a tonne, for three months
delivery, but yesterday touched Dollars 1,940, before closing at Dollars
1,923.50 a tonne, up Dollars 46 on the week.
Nickel prices were again highly volatile. After losing Dollars 835 in the
early sell-off the three months contract closed yesterday at Dollars
8,687.50 a tonne, down Dollars 177.50 on the week. The EIU report forecast
that nickel's average value in 1995 would be 22 per cent ahead of this
year's as Russian exports dropped for the fourth year in succession and
western consumption grew.
The London Commodity Exchange robusta coffee market yesterday repaired some
of the damage sustained in mid-week, when heavy selling wiped about Dollars
350-a-tonne off nearby futures prices. The March position rose by Dollars
127 on the day to close at Dollars 2,635 a tonne, still Dollars 168 down on
the week.
The selling on Tuesday and Wednesday had been largely technically driven. It
was also influenced, however, by a report from German statistics agency FO
Licht putting world production in 1994-95 at 92.3m bags (60kg each), up from
91.1m in 1993-94, and consumption at 93.4m, down from 95.9m.
Market sentiments had already been weakened by a US Department of
Agriculture report last week that showed world coffee stocks were higher
than the market thought.
Technical factors were partly responsible for a Pounds 40-a-tonne jump in
LCE cocoa values on Thursday. 'Short-covering has been the main dynamism but
there was also a strong technical motivation,' one trader told the Reuters
news agency.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In general the market remained on the quiet side this week, which is not
unusual for the time of year, reports Man Producten. Buyers of black pepper
were very scarce. On the other hand the selling pressure from most producing
countries disappeared and prices more or less stabilised at about USDollars
2,400 a tonne for spot black, faq. White pepper prices tended firmer,
however, reaching about Dollars 3550 a tonne, cif, for December/January
shipment. Buying interest for second and third quarter 1995 deliveries made
whites more expensive. As China and Sarawak can not sell large quantities
until the new crop starts to arrive in July all white pepper demand has to
be covered in Indonesia where stocks are already unusually low.

FT  17 DEC 94 / International Company News: GE plans share buy-back worth
Dollars 5bn over two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Electric, the US conglomerate, is to buy back up to Dollars 5bn of
its shares over the next two years. This brings total buy-backs announced
this year by US corporations to a record Dollars 65bn, according to the Wall
Street firm Securities Data. The previous record was set in 1989 with
Dollars 62bn.
Mr Jack Welch, GE chairman, said 'we have concluded that GE stock today
represents the best investment we can make'.
The company has not bought in stock since 1992, having spent Dollars 5bn in
the period 1989-92. The programme originally announced in 1989 envisaged
purchases of up to Dollars 10bn.
Large buy-backs have accelerated in recent weeks, from companies such as
Merck, Chrysler and Walt Disney. However, the largest of the year was
Dollars 6bn from Philip Morris, the tobacco company, announced in August.
Mr Welch said the company's strong cash generation allowed it to continue
its capital investment programme, make complementary acquisitions and fund
share repurchases. Moody's, the debt rating agency, yesterday confirmed its
triple A rating on GE's debt. The company has gross borrowings of Dollars
5.9bn and cash of Dollars 3.7bn.
GE also said it would raise its quarterly dividend by 14 per cent to 41
cents a share. The company had lifted its dividend every year since 1975, it
said. The previous increase was 13 per cent last December.
This year, GE has suffered losses estimated at Dollars 1.5bn on Kidder
Peabody, its stockbroking subsidiary, which was hit by alleged fraud and is
now being sold off. However, its third-quarter profits were a record Dollars
1.37bn net, a rise of 13 per cent.
Mr Welch said he expected the buy-back programme to increase the rate of
growth in the company's earnings per share and its return on equity. GE
shares rose Dollars 1 1/4 to close at Dollars 50.

<TEXT>
Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian resources group, yesterday announced
a 30.6 per cent advance in first-half profits after tax but before
abnormals, to ADollars 836m (USDollars 653m).
The figure compared with ADollars 640m in the same six months to
end-November in the previous year. Revenues rose 10.4 per cent, to ADollars
9.21bn, and basic earnings per share, excluding abnormals, were 59.9 cents,
up from 47.9 cents. The interim dividend is increased 14.3 per cent, to 24
cents a share. BHP took an after-tax abnormal gain of ADollars 234m, for the
sale of its remaining stake in Woodside Petroleum. This brought bottom-line
profits after tax to ADollars 1.07bn, 67.2 per cent higher than in 1993-94.
Mr John Prescott, managing director, noted the figures had been achieved at
a time of quite depressed prices, although he conceded that the copper
price, which reached a four-year high during the period, had been an
exception. He suggested the annual round of negotiations between Japanese
buyers and Australian coal and iron ore suppliers, which is under way in
Japan, should bring gains in bulk commodities, and said that higher prices
should 'impact favourably' towards the end of the current six-month period.
'Firmer world growth should underpin improving prices for some of the
company's key products,' said BHP, adding that Australia's strong economic
growth should lift domestic demand for steel, 'although some government
initiatives can be expected to manage this growth'.

<TEXT>
Westdeutsche Landesbank is to take a 24.9 per cent share in a capital issue
by the ailing Bank Morski in Szczecin and become the second German bank to
obtain an operating licence in Poland.
The German bank, which applied to open a wholly-owned subsidiary in Poland
12 months ago, made the move after the National Bank of Poland (NBP), the
central bank, said it would only issue licences to foreign banks if they
were willing to help shore up the private sector by buying into troubled
banks.
Westdeutsche's partner in the venture is the state-owned Polish Development
Bank which is to take 75.1 per cent of the new issue.
Bank Morski has been managed by receivers for a year and NBP has promised to
help finance its recovery.

FT  17 DEC 94 / International Company News: Compaq sides with Intel over
Pentium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Compaq Computer, the world's largest personal computer manufacturer, has
sided with Intel in the controversy over a flaw in Intel's Pentium
microprocessors.
The PC maker said that after thorough analysis it has concluded the vast
majority of PC users will not be affected by the flaw, which can cause
errors in mathematical calculations. Compaq said it would continue to sell
Pentium-based PCs. Compaq's decision is a vote of confidence for the Intel
chip, following IBM's move earlier this week to halt shipments of
Pentium-based PCs.
IBM says errors due to the Pentium flaw could occur once in every 24 days
and users of common spreadsheet programs may be seriously affected. Intel,
which was forced to acknowledge that its flagship product was flawed last
month when a professor in Virginia discovered errors in his research
results, contends the rate of errors is fewer than once in every 27,000
years.
Compaq said it has examined data from Intel and IBM and conducted its own
study of the Pentium problem. 'We have confirmed that the statistical
likelihood of errors is extremely remote,' said Mr Jim Paschal, Compaq
vice-president of desktop computing. The assumptions upon which IBM based
its calculations are valid only for very highly numeric intensive
applications, he said.
Several other PC manufacturers have this week announced they would continue
to sell Pentium PCs, in spite of the flaw. Critics charge, however, that
such companies may be acting out of self interest to avoid stalling sales
during the busy Christmas sales season.
Compaq's motives are less open to challenge because its PC models are based
on earlier 486 microprocessors and the company has in recent months been
highly critical of Intel's efforts to promote the Pentium chip as the PC
engine of choice for home PC buyers.

FT  17 DEC 94 / International Company News: Eramet in share swap for nickel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eramet, the recently-listed French metals group, is swapping a 2.4 per cent
stake in its existing capital for Cofremmi, a subsidiary of Bureau de
Recherches Geologique et Minieres (BRGM) in a deal worth about FFr123m
(Dollars 22.7m).
The deal gives Eramet 800,000 tonnes of nickel contained in ore reserves in
several deposits in New Caledonia that are surrounded by deposits owned by
Societe Metallurgique Le Nickel (SLN), Eramet's subsidiary. Mr Alain Ray,
Eramet's planning director, said the acquisition would permit the economic
development of the total area. SLN's reserves previously totalled 2m tonnes
of nickel.
Eramet, the world's fourth-largest nickel producer, said it would increase
SLN's annual output by 20 per cent from 50,000 tonnes to 60,000 tonnes by
2000. Mr Ray said capacity would start to rise next year to 51,000-52,000
tonnes.

FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Kolbenschmidt hits out over T&amp;N
stakebuilding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kolbenschmidt, the German automotive components supplier, yesterday attacked
the attempted acquisition of a majority stake by T&amp;N, the UK automotive
components and engineering group, as 'an unfriendly takeover'.
Mr Heinrich Binder, chairman of the Kolbenschmidt management board, held
talks with the German cartel authorities in Berlin yesterday in an attempt
to block the deal. Protest petitions signed by 2,500 workers have been sent
to the economics ministers of four German states. Mr Binder said: 'We do not
need anyone to help us financially. We have achieved the turnround and are
back in the black.'
T&amp;N announced in September that it would pay up to DM282.6m (Pounds 117.7m)
to acquire a 52.5 per cent stake in Kolbenschmidt, which designs and
manufactures a wide range of engine pistons, bearings and bushes, oil and
water pumps and aluminium castings.
The deal would make T&amp;N one of the world's leading producers of engine
pistons, vying for the number one position with Mahle of Germany. In
bearings it would rival Federal Mogul of the US.
The UK group has secured an option to purchase the majority stake, but the
deal is subject to approval by competition authorities in the US, Germany,
France and the UK. Mr Binder said he believed that the German cartel office
would block the deal.
T&amp;N claimed that it had received 'numerous offers of support' from leading
German vehicle makers.
It acquired its option on the majority stake as part of the restructuring of
Metallgesellschaft, the German metals, mining and engineering group, which
sold its 47 per cent holding in Kolbenschmidt to Commerzbank and
institutions.
T&amp;N's option expires at the end of March. An initial verdict from the German
cartel office is expected in February.
Kolbenschmidt said yesterday it had achieved a pre-tax profit of DM14m in
the year to September, against a DM114m loss. Group turnover fell by 21 per
cent to DM1.25bn.

FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Autumn sales lift Courtaulds Textiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Courtaulds Textiles rose 16p to 435p yesterday after Britain's
second largest clothing and fabrics manufacturer defied raw material price
increases and unseasonably warm weather by reporting encouraging sales
during the crucial autumn season.
The rising share price, however, only partially reversed several months of
decline, which worsened in September when the group announced a 26 per cent
fall in first half profits following significant losses at its
newly-acquired French hosiery businesses.
Nevertheless, the group said a 'satisfactory' performance in recent months
and minimal restructuring costs would help it meet full year profit targets,
estimated at about Pounds 47m by analysts.
The group's optimism was due in part to increased orders from Marks and
Spencer, its largest customer, according to Ms Julia Blake of BZW. 'Demand
from M&amp;S has taken off with a vengeance and suppliers across the sector are
extremely relieved,' she said.
While not downplaying the importance of M&amp;S, Courtaulds Textiles claimed
trading had improved following the success of a three-pronged strategy aimed
at maintaining margins. Its exposure to raw material price increases has
been limited by building up forward stocks; higher prices have been passed
on successfully on towels and bedding; and new products have all had
increased prices built in.

FT  17 DEC 94 / International Company News: Inmarsat wins satellite funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inmarsat, the London-based satellite communications organisation, has
promises of more than Dollars 1bn from its members to finance a global
mobile phone satellite service.
The figure exceeded its expectations, and follows a decision last week by
the organisation's ruling assembly to approve the project.
Members from more than 40 countries have agreed to the investment. They
include many of the world's leading telecommunications operators. An
investors meeting will be held in January to formalise the project.
The system, based on intermediate orbit satellite technology, is expected to
cost Dollars 2.6bn in total. It will provide a worldwide service for digital
telephone, fax data and paging. It is expected to go live in 1999.
Inmarsat pioneered maritime voice and data in the 1980s, but faces
competition from a number of other consortia in the provision of the new
service. The principal competition seems to be Iridium, led by Motorola of
the US, which has also completed its equity funding.
Brussels yesterday formally approved the creation of a new satellite
telecommunications company, arguing it would promote competition in the
lucrative market for transatlantic business telecoms services.
International Private Satellite Partners (IPSP) comprises a group of nine
companies including Orion Satellite Corporation of the US, Com Dev Satellite
Communications of Canada, Kingston Communications International of the UK
and Stet of Italy.
IPSP will own and operate two high-power satellites which will be placed in
geosynchronous orbit over the Atlantic Ocean. The first was launched last
November and is expected to be operational by the end of the year.
The EC said that IPSP would be competition for the strategic alliances being
forged between existing carriers - often public telephone operators - and
international satellite organisation such as Intelsat.

FT  17 DEC 94 / International Company News: SCA in SKr1.3bn rationalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Competition in Europe's disposable nappy market yesterday forced SCA, the
big Swedish forestry products group, to announce a SKr1.3bn (Dollars 173m)
rationalisation programme in the nappy-making operations of its subsidiary
Molnlycke which include the Peaudouce and Libero brand names.
Molnlycke has been hit by a tough battle for market share in Europe in
disposable nappy and female hygiene products since Kimberley Clark, the US
group, stepped up its efforts a year ago to build up its position, adding to
the competitive pressures imposed by Procter &amp; Gamble.
Prices have fallen by 10 per cent while marketing costs have soared by up to
30 per cent.
The nappy war caused a 19 per cent fall in Molnlycke's operating profit in
the first nine months of this year, in spite of the company's largely
successful defence of its leading position in branded nappies in its key
markets in the Nordic countries, the Netherlands and France.
It is the biggest producer of own-label nappy products for retailers in
Europe.
The cost of the battle has raised a question mark over SCA's readiness to
continue to take on the US groups.

<TEXT>
ED&amp;F Man is to appeal against a decision by the FT-SE Actuaries Industry
Classification Committee to reclassify the agricultural and financial
services group from the Food Manufacturing to the Other Financials sector.
Mr Harvey McGrath, managing director, said that over two thirds of Man's
profits come from the food business. However, the committee said a review of
Man's operations over the past five years showed that most of the group's
revenue was earned from financial services. The current year's revenues were
unusual in that the group's fund management business had underperformed.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Moorgate Investment Trust saw undiluted net asset value per share dip by 5.3
per cent, from 162.1p to 153.5p, during the half year to November 30 - a
modest outperformance against its benchmark, the Hoare Govett Smaller
Companies Index, which fell 6.2 per cent over the same period.
Net revenue declined to Pounds 712,000 (Pounds 828,000), reflecting the
managers' decision to invest in lower-yielding shares 'with superior
earnings and dividend growth prospects', according to Sir Mark Thomson,
chairman.
Earnings per share consequently emerged at 2.52p, against 2.93p, but the
interim dividend is maintained at 1.7p and a modest increase in the final
(2.55p) is anticipated.

Despite turnover 13 per cent ahead, full-year pre-tax profits at Intercare
Group, the healthcare product supplier, fell 46 per cent from Pounds 4.31m
to Pounds 2.33m.
The Pounds 43.4m sales figure for the year to October 31 was up from Pounds
39m last time and included Pounds 976,000 from acquisitions. The group
attributed the disappointing outcome to a 'significant contraction' in the
Dutch scooter market and poor performance by new ventures in the medical
products business. Recovery was expected in both areas.
Earnings per share emerged at 5.5p (10.5p). The recommended final dividend
is unchanged at 2.8p, maintaining the total for the year at 3.5p.

FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Chiltern consolidates recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following a modest return to the black at the interim stage, Chiltern Radio
yesterday announced a resumption of dividends as it consolidated the
recovery over the full year to September 30.
On turnover ahead 8 per cent to Pounds 6.21m, the pre-tax line showed a
turnround of Pounds 760,000 to profits of Pounds 514,000. The outcome took
in net costs of Pounds 53,000 related to the unsuccessful bid from CLT, the
Luxembourg-based multimedia group, which was more than offset by a gain of
Pounds 72,000 from the disposal of its stakes in Independent Radio News and
Gloucester Broadcasting.
The group now operates 11 radio stations, all but one having the full 8-year
licence period outstanding. Mr Peter Burton, chairman, said that national
advertising revenue was up 20 per cent year-on-year but local revenue
sources remained relatively flat.
Earnings were 5.4p against losses of 3.4p; dividends are restored at 1p.

FT  17 DEC 94 / International Company News: Cariplo counter-bid pleases
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian stock market yesterday welcomed the announcement by Cariplo, the
world's biggest savings bank, that it planned a counter-bid for Credito
Romagnolo (Rolo) of Bologna, in alliance with other companies.
Directors of Rolo will meet today in Bologna to discuss the Cariplo offer,
announced on Thursday, and the previous bid from Cariplo's Milanese rival
Credito Italiano (Credit).
On Thursday, Rolo said it had received the offer 'with interest'. 'The
announcement firms up the hypothesis, already laid out to Rolo's management
in an atmosphere of mutual collaboration, of a competing offer significantly
better than that of Credito Italiano.'
The consortium led by Cariplo intends to offer L21,500 a share for 70 per
cent of Rolo. That compares with Credit's improved offer of L20,000 for only
a 65 per cent holding. If shareholders accept, the Cariplo consortium will
have to pay L3,291bn (Dollars 2bn) for the stake, 18 per cent more than
Credit would have paid. Analysts agreed yesterday that the Cariplo offer
would probably put Rolo out of reach of Credit, unless it too teams up with
other bidders.
Trading yesterday on the Milan stock exchange also suggested that Cariplo's
plans might be enough to win Rolo. The Bologna bank's shares closed nearly 3
per cent higher at L18,884, having risen 3 per cent on Thursday ahead of the
announcement.
Cariplo, which is unquoted and owned by a charitable foundation, is likely
to have a majority of the consortium. But other banks are set to form a
nocciolo duro, or hard core, within Rolo's shareholder list if the bid
succeeds.
At the moment only IMI, the privatised banking group, and Cassa di Risparmio
in Bologna, Rolo's neighbour, have formally put their names to the offer,
but Bank Austria, which is controlled by the Vienna city authorities, and
Reale Mutua, an Italian insurance company, are said to be discussing joining
the bid.
Cariplo and its allies still require the backing of the Bank of Italy,
responsible for supervising Italy's fragmented banking sector, and Consob,
the stock exchange watchdog. The group has until January to launch the offer
formally. Credit's bid opens on Monday, and closes on January 16.
If the Cariplo consortium wins the backing of the Rolo board today, it will
represent a victory for a collaborative approach.
The Milan savings bank, Italy's third largest bank, began discussing a deal
with Rolo nine months ago.
Analysts believe that Credit, on the other hand, made a number of crucial
errors when it first announced plans for a bid at the end of October.
Credit's first outline offer - of L19,000 a share - was dismissed as hostile
by Rolo, and although its second bid received a warmer welcome two weeks
ago, Rolo directors stopped short of giving it full support.
A defeat for Credit would represent a defeat for Mediobanca, the secretive
Milan merchant bank which has built up a strong influence over Credit and
Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI), its recently privatised neighbour.
BCI was thwarted in its attempt to gain control of Banco Ambrosiano Veneto,
another quoted Italian bank, launched at about the same time Credit made its
approach to Rolo.
Before the Cariplo plans were announced, Mr Lucio Rondelli, Credit chairman,
criticised the possibility of a deal with Cariplo, because, he said, it
would put Rolo - one of Italy's most efficient quoted banks - under the
shadow of the public sector.
The Italian Treasury and the Bank of Italy have stressed that public
foundations, such as the one that owns Cariplo, should accelerate the
process of listing the shares of their banking subsidiaries. Cariplo (short
for Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde) planned to float about 20
per cent of its shares on the Milan stock market earlier this year, but
abandoned the operation because of adverse market conditions.

FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: QMH details rescue package - Pounds 1.3bn
debt reconstruction could leave shareholders with 40%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Queens Moat Houses yesterday unveiled details of a Pounds 1.3bn rescue plan
almost two years after its shares were suspended, which could leave existing
investors with 40 per cent of the heavily indebted hotels group.
The stake is substantially higher than that won for shareholders recently in
other large debt reconstructions. At Heron, for example, shareholders have
been diluted down to 5 per cent.
The Queens Moat package includes a Pounds 200m debt for equity swap which
will allow existing shareholders to increase their stake. The swap is, in
effect, an equity issue underwritten by the company's banks which will be
priced at 8.6p. Few shareholders are expected to buy the shares at this
price.
The survival of Queens Moat is still in question, however, as one lender
continues to resist the package. It must be unanimously approved by the
company's 74 lenders before investors can vote on the proposals.
Queens Moat refused to comment on individual creditors, but it is believed
that the unhappy lender is California-based Trust Company of the West. TCW,
which bought the debt in the secondary market, is thought to disagree with
its ranking relative to other creditors.
Mr Andrew Coppel, the chief executive brought in by the banks to replace the
company's founder Mr John Bairstow last year, said he was confident the
proposals represented a good deal for creditors and shareholders. 'The
alternative is stark,' he said. 'The group would have to cease to trade.'
Under these proposals, Mr Coppel said, Queens Moat would not have to return
to shareholders for further finanical support. However, investors would be
unlikely to receive a dividend in the foreseeable future.
In addition to the debt swap, which will give ordinary shareholders 24 per
cent of the company and preference holders 16.2 per cent, Pounds 630m of the
Pounds 1.3bn debt will be restructured into longer-term and convertible
borrowing. This will be payable between 2000 and 2008.
The convertible instruments allow for a second debt for equity swap, at the
board's discretion, which could leave lenders with 75 per cent control. Mr
Coppel did not expect the second swap would be necessary; it was there as
protection in the event of unforeseen difficulties.
Other elements include the conversion of preference shares into ordinary
equity on substantially enhanced terms and amendments to debenture stock
terms.
Finally, banks have agreed to waive Pounds 43m in interest accrued since the
beginning of the year. This is roughly equal to the fees which Queens Moat
has incurred in the negotiations.
After the restructuring, Queens Moat's net liabilities would be Pounds 184m.
A circular detailing the proposals will be sent to shareholders in the new
year if the final lender agrees to the terms. This would open the way for
the shares to resume trading in the spring.
One substantial institutional shareholder said he was likely to back the
proposals. 'The banks could have left equity holders with nothing,' he said.
Now that the restructuring is largely out of the way, however, shareholders
will begin tackling operational issues, such as management, he added. 'It is
not necessarily the case that the people with the qualifications to get the
finanical restructuring out of the way are the right people to  .. run a
hotel company.'
Queens Moat has been in negotiations with bankers since April 1993, when it
became apparent it would breach certain loan covenants. Subsequent
valuations wiped Pounds 1bn off its property portfolio and last year the
group reported the second biggest loss in UK corporate history.

FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional costs push Huntingdon Pounds
71m into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Huntingdon International Holdings dived 23p to 20p yesterday as
exceptional costs of Pounds 70.8m plunged the life sciences group into
annual pre-tax losses of Pounds 71.1m, against profits of Pounds 8.68m.
The group has also appointed administrators to Travers Morgan, its UK-based
consultancy. HIH had been trying to sell Travers Morgan, as well as HEE, its
US engineering and environmental services business, but could not find
buyers at the right price.
The Pounds 70.8m (Pounds 3.01m) exceptional charges consisted of Pounds
33.9m relating to TM and Pounds 36.9m for the restructuring of HEE. Mr
Christopher Cliffe, HIH deputy chief executive and finance director, said he
would be 'utterly dismayed' if there were to be further charges in the
current year.
The group said it had made provisions of Pounds 18m since it bought TM in
December 1991, and had decided not to inject further funds into the
consultancy.
Changes in the market in the UK, a general lack of large infrastructure
projects, and the government's containment of public expenditure were all
cited as causes of weakened overall demand for TM's services.
Mr Cliffe said the primary responsibility of the HIH board was to its
shareholders and it was 'right and proper' to restrict their exposure to TM
and ring-fence the consultancy by administration. He did not think there was
'a large number' of TM creditors.
In the year to September 30 TM, which employs 720 people in the UK and 800
worldwide, incurred operating losses of Pounds 1.29m (profits Pounds 2.74m)
on turnover of Pounds 34.6m (Pounds 37.2m).
HEE made operating losses of Pounds 1.58m (profits Pounds 5.28m) on turnover
of Pounds 70.7m (Pounds 79.2m). Mr Cliffe said 'part of the division's
problems were attributable to poor management', adding that new management
was now in place.
Profits from the life sciences side fell to Pounds 8.5m (Pounds 9.1m) on
turnover up at Pounds 41.5m (Pounds 39.7m).
Group revenues, net of sub-contract costs, totalled Pounds 146.7m (Pounds
156.1m); operating profits tumbled to Pounds 2.53m (Pounds 15.5m). Losses
per share were 0.704p (earnings 0.073p), and losses per ADR were 5.311 cents
(earnings 0.55 cents). The final dividend is passed.

FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 188m bonus for Yorkshire Electricity
shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshire Electricity is to give its shareholders a Pounds 188m special
dividend after a period in which profits soared 32 per cent.
Mr Chris Hampson, chairman of the Leeds-based electricity distributor, said:
'These outstanding results reflect the delivery of our strategy of growing
the business and cutting costs.'
The pay-out, which will have to be approved at a special meeting on January
13, will be worth 90p a share to all shareholders at the close of business
last Thursday. The effect will be offset by a 22-for-25 share consolidation.
Altogether, the package has a similar effect to the share buy-backs which
other recs have completed in recent weeks. But Yorkshire said it is fairer
because it distributes the gains evenly among all shareholders. In addition
to the special dividend, shareholders will receive a 15 per cent increase in
the interim dividend to 7.92p.
In the six months to September 30, Yorkshire's turnover rose 10 per cent to
Pounds 647m, producing pre-tax profits of Pounds 97.6m, up 32 per cent on
last year's first half.
Much of the growth came from the supply business, where profits more than
doubled to Pounds 8.6m. But the distribution business also produced sharply
increased profits - up 23 per cent to Pounds 82m - thanks to cost savings.
Yorkshire is halfway through a 1,000-job reduction programme.
For domestic customers, Yorkshire will be cutting prices by 3.5 per cent
next April, when new price regulations come into force. This will bring the
total price reduction since privatisation to 19 per cent in real terms.
The result was marred by a continuing loss of Pounds 3.4m at Homepower, the
retailing venture jointly owned with East Midlands. Yorkshire said it would
decide whether to keep, sell or close down the business by next March.
The special dividend comes at the end of a week which has seen sharp rises
in electricity profits as well as indications of the first electric utility
takeover bid - for Northern Electric.
Mr Hampson said that he saw no point in recs merging in the face of takeover
threats. Any savings from merging head offices would be offset by merger
premiums and regulatory factors. However Yorkshire would consider any
actions that enhanced shareholder value.
COMMENT
The special dividend should restore Yorkshire's favour in the City, where
the perception was growing that it had lost interest in its shareholders.
The sharp drop in the share price yesterday merely reflects the fact that
Pounds 188m of cash will flow out of the company in January, but that should
be exactly offset by the share consolidation. The result also showed that
Yorkshire's efforts to grow distribution and supply profits are paying off,
the first through cost-cutting and the second by finding new customers
outside the region. Management also made a much-needed commitment to deal
with the Homepower problem before the financial year is out. The real test
will be whether the newly consolidated shares continue to trade among the
sector's highest yielding stocks.

Ensor Holdings, the USM-quoted supplier of building materials, swung back
into the black with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 176,000 for the six months to
September 30.
The outcome compared with a deficit of Pounds 32,000 last time and with a
loss of Pounds 180,000 at the March 31 year-end. Turnover for the six months
grew to Pounds 7.36m (Pounds 6.93m).
At the operating level profits were Pounds 204,000 (Pounds 23,000) and the
interest charge was cut from Pounds 55,000 to Pounds 28,000. Earnings came
out at 0.6p (0.1p losses).

FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Your Dog makes its debut with a chewy treat
 -Raymond Snoddy on Emap's latest launch, which is aiming to take Britain's
8m dog owners by storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week Emap, the media group, launched its latest magazine, Your Dog, a
glossy bi-monthly that came complete with a bone-shaped chewy treat stuck to
the cover.
The cover picture featured an adorable pooch, designed to catch the eye of
Britain's 8m dog owners. It had plenty of what Mr Ian Beacham, publishing
director of Emap Pursuit Publishing, described as 'big eyeball contact'.
Inside there is plenty of practical advice, including the wisdom of holding
a dog's tail with your free hand while taking its temperature.
Your Dog was the almost inevitable consequence of the successful debut of
Your Cat last year after Emap journalist Ms Sue Parslow, who edited
Fishkeeping Answers, pushed for and got permission to launch a new cat
publication.
With the help of cover gifts that included a plastic cat bowl and special
formula cat milk, Your Cat took the cat publishing world by storm with sales
of more than 60,000 - yet it probably cost little more than Pounds 50,000 to
launch. The latest issue of Your Cat, out this week, will have a tin of
catfood attached.
Launching new magazines is one side of Emap, a company that in the last 10
years has nearly quadrupled sales to Pounds 362m. Last year's pre-tax
profits were a record Pounds 45.7m.
Another side is demonstrated by Tuesday's announcement that it was paying
Pounds 60m to buy Maclean Hunter European Publishing from Rogers
Communications of Toronto. MHEP, with interests in seven European countries,
publishes 22 market directories, seven electronic information services and
34 business magazines, including UK Press Gazette and Werbe Woche, the Swiss
marketing magazine.
During the first half of this financial year Emap spent Pounds 197m on
acquisitions, including Pounds 106m on 28 magazines from French publisher
Editions Mondiales and a further 10 consumer titles from companies within
the Hersant group. Despite the acquisitions - and the latest makes Emap a
serious contender in the German market - Mr Robin Miller, chief executive,
treasures magazine launches above all else.
'For Emap, growing and launching is more important. New product development
fires up all our people. If a journalist comes up with an idea and it stands
up, they might get to edit it,' says Mr Miller, a former editor of
Motorcycle News, one of Emap's early successes.
The return on investment from a successful magazine launch, he adds, is
particularly high.
Not every Emap magazine launch is a sure-fire hit. Jig Jag, a music magazine
for distribution in music stores, was such a 'turkey' that it was killed off
after one issue. And Car Week, an ambitious Pounds 5m attack on the
lucrative weekly car magazine market, has had a tough time. Launched in
newspaper format, it failed to meet its targets and was relaunched this
spring as a glossy magazine. It now sells about 60,000 copies compared with
the hoped-for 80,000.
A rival publisher, while conceding that Emap has done well, nevertheless saw
the problems of Car Week as a turning point.
'That was a bit of a watershed and dented their confidence,' he said.
Mr Derek Terrington, media analyst at Kleinwort Benson, praised Emap's
magazine success, but would like to see more excitement in its local and
regional newspaper operations to justify a top rating.
Emap, which has added commercial radio and exhibitions to its more
established newspaper and magazine businesses, also has new launches in mind
even when it acquires other companies. The purchase of a car magazine called
Practical Classics led to the launch of Popular Classics and Classic Car
Weekly.
'Acquisitions give us aircraft carriers to get into new markets, new
territories,' says Mr Miller.
The company has paid considerable attention to the provision of professional
information, often delivered electronically, to back up its business titles.
Mr Miller says: 'What we are trying to offer is a broadly based media
solution for business, providing the connection from the seller to the
buyer.'
As a spin-off from its biggest consumer magazines, Emap has started to get
involved in moving pictures. It is now producing golf videos to go alongside
magazines such as Fore and Today's Golfer. A little further down the line,
specialist television channels are possible.
One priority for next year, though, is celebrating the 300th anniversary of
the founding of one of Emap's local newspapers - The Stamford Mercury, which
goes into virtually every home in the Lincolnshire market town.
'We want to continue to be dominant in all these markets, whether it be the
market for young women, the local market, or the market for business people
interested in fleet cars,' Mr Miller says.

FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Lincoln National to acquire Liberty Life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lincoln National, the financial services group, is in discussions over the
purchase of Liberty Life Assurance, the small UK life insurer and subsidiary
of Hansard Financial Trust.
The move, expected to be completed early in January, is a further stage in
the rationalisation of the UK life insurance sector, where competition is
intensifying and putting increasing pressure on costs.
Acquiring LLA will give Lincoln National 180 sales agents to add to its
direct sales force of 590, and will increase its funds under management by
almost half to Pounds 1.6bn. The number of clients will rise by almost one
third to 460,000.
Mr Jeffrey Nick, Lincoln National's managing director, said there would be
some redundancies among LLA support staff, but Lincoln National would be
able to accommodate some LLA employees in its new head office in Uxbridge.
The acquisition is the company's third in two years - it bought Citibank
Life in August last year and Crown Unit Trusts a few months earlier. As a
subsidiary of an overseas parent - it is wholly owned by Lincoln National
Corporation, the US investment and insurance group - it is in one of the
categories of life company identified as vulnerable to a price war if it
does not attain critical mass.
Mr Nick said the purchase of LLA was 'clear evidence of our parent company's
commitment to building a presence in the UK commensurate with its size and
reputation in other markets'.
With Pounds 26.9m in regular premiums and Pounds 93.4m in single premiums
last year, Lincoln National was just below the 40 largest UK life companies.
LLA's income was Pounds 5.2m in regular premiums and Pounds 55.4m in single
premiums.

FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: SAIF takes 30% stake in Golden Charter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The consolidation of the UK funeral industry took another step yesterday
with the sale to the Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors of
a 30 per cent stake, valued at Pounds 3m, in Golden Charter, a provider of
pre-paid funeral plans.
SAIF, formed in 1989, represents 500 independent funeral directors. Its
members make up two thirds of the funeral directors who sell Golden
Charter's plans. Mr Michael France, president of SAIF, said the deal would
allow 'every independent funeral director to compete in the growing funeral
planning market'.
The two parties said they had been in discussions for some time but the deal
had been accelerated by recent moves in the UK market.
Mr Gordon Kee, chief executive of Golden Charter, said he expected the
pre-paid funeral business to expand by 30 to 40 per cent over the next 10
years.
There is no immediate cash payment and the consideration depends on Golden
Charter achieving profitability and growth targets. Mr Kee said details of
these would be disclosed in the new year. Golden Charter is jointly owned by
Mr Kee and Mr Andrew Harvey.

month
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andrew Morton has resigned as chairman of Baris Holdings, the drylining
and fire protection systems group, after less than a month. Mr John Foley
has become chairman and chief executive.
Mr Morton's resignation, due to the 'increasing time requirements' of the
other companies of which he is chairman, came as Baris reported an interim
pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.29m compared with a profit of Pounds 143,000 last
time. Sales for the six months to September 30 were 33 per cent down at
Pounds 5.43m (Pounds 8.14m).
This half's deficit included a Pounds 1.1m exceptional item relating to
costs and write-offs as a result of withdrawal from the German market.
Losses per share came out at 20.5p (0.1p earnings).

to AP Fonden, the Swedish national pension fund, for Pounds 76.5m.
The building is let to Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, on a 25-year
lease from June 1990, when the building was first occupied, with a break in
2002.
The annual rent is Pounds 6.9m, or about Pounds 44 per sq ft. This is well
above the current headline rents for top City offices of about Pounds 35 per
sq ft.
The exit yield of 8.85 per cent reflects the fact that the building is
unlikely to show rental growth for some years.
Mr Ian Henderson, a director of Land Securities, said the building had been
sold at above book value, which is based on its revaluation at March 1994.
'The disposal reflects our policy of adjusting the balance our portfolio
away from City offices,' he said.
The acquisition is AP Fonden's second large deal in the City this year. In
the summer it acquired nearby Angel Court for about Pounds 60m. The fund
also owns Four Millbank, near Westminster.

FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Tate &amp; Lyle in Pounds 36m Mexican
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugar and sweeteners group, yesterday announced a Dollars
56m (Pounds 35.8m) investment in Grupo Industrial Azucarero de Occidente,
Mexico's fifth largest sugar group.
The UK company is buying a 49 per cent stake from the Saenz family, whose
trusts will continue to own the remaining majority share. The Mexican
company, also known as the Saenz Group, recorded turnover of some Pounds
89.1m for the 10 months to October 31, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.6m.
Net assets stood at Pounds 69.3m.
Saenz has an estimated 7 per cent of the Mexican sweetener market, which
produces approximately 4m tonnes a year. The top five sugar processors in
Mexico account for about 60 per cent of total Mexican output and 64 per cent
of refined sugar production.
Tate &amp; Lyle said that Saenz's operation of two mills in the north-eastern
state of Tamaulipas and one in Jalisco, gave quick access to the growing
markets in Guadalajara, Monterrey and northern Mexico.
It added that the investment would enable the group to play a part in the
fast expanding soft drinks market in Mexico. Strong demand was also expected
from the food processing and retail grocery markets. The move was part of
the company's strategy of expanding into emerging markets through joint
ventures and partnerships.

FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: SE commitment to small shareholders
criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stock Exchange was yesterday criticised by one of its non-executive
directors, who resigned earlier this week, for neglecting private
shareholders in favour of global and institutional investors.
Mr David Jones, chief executive of Sharelink Investment Services, the
Birmingham-based share dealing company, called for a 'top to bottom' review
at the exchange to help lift the profile of smaller shareholders.
After stepping down from the Stock Exchange board, which he only joined in
April, Mr Jones said: 'I've been getting at them for six years that they
need to step up their commitment to private investors. I'm still waiting for
the exchange to do something concrete.'
He denied, however, that his resignation was linked to any differences with
the board, on which he was expected to serve a three-year term.
In a statement, the Stock Exchange said Mr Jones wanted to devote his time
to Sharelink and the advisory committee on Crest, the electronic settlement
system under development by the Bank of England.
In recent months Sharelink has been dogged by low volumes and made a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 468,000 in the six months to September 30. Although there had
been a pick-up in orders from some investors, Mr Jones said trading remained
poor.

FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: De La Rue in further talks with Portals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Portals and De La Rue were last night locked in negotiations amid reports
that the latter had made an offer in excess of Pounds 10 a share for the
specialist paper group.
The all-day meeting was the second the two sides had held this week and
followed the news last week that De La Rue had made an approach to Portals.
The fiercely independent Portals board is thought to consider a figure of
more than Pounds 10 a share as the minimum it would be prepared to put to
shareholders, with many observers expecting them to hold out for between
Pounds 11 and Pounds 12.
The approach by De La Rue was made public on December 6 following a sharp
rise in Portals share price.
A subsequent statement by De La Rue said that it would not make a bid
without the agreement of the Portals board.
It is the second time this year the two groups have been in takeover talks.
De La Rue made its first approach in May, with analysts suggesting an offer
being made of about 900p per share, which was rebuffed by Portals.
The length of the latest round of talks suggests a higher offer has been
forthcoming. Analysts said that an offer of Pounds 10 per share, which would
value Portals at Pounds 648m, would most likely be funded by cash and
equity. De La Rue has about Pounds 250m in cash.
Portals shares closed up 14p at 920p yesterday. They have risen by 215p
since the news of the latest approach. De La Rue shares rose by 21p to 955p.
Last week, Portals attempted to bolster its defences by announcing a Pounds
100m contract with the Indian government, the biggest value banknote
contract ever. Portals said the order, which will begin early next year,
should allow the group to operate at capacity for the foreseeable future.
De La Rue is one of Portals' largest customers and is believed to be keen to
acquire Portals' technology and expertise in developing banknote security
features.

Granada, the leisure and television group, has become one of the first
companies to give full details in its annual report of share options held by
its directors.
Under new guidance issued by the Accounting Standards Board in September,
greater transparency was urged on companies, although a few already
published share option details.
The report shows that Mr Gerry Robinson, the group's chief executive, is
sitting on a paper profit of Pounds 2.3m.
He has 737,500 share options which he can exercise now at a price of 184p
each. Granada's share price closed the week at 498p.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Wrapped up in cable: Tony Jackson previews the explosion in
home TV services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How many TV channels can you handle? If you are British, you may get by
quite happily with four. If you live in parts of New York, you could be
faced with 150.
If that seems daunting, a new system shown this week in the town of Orlando,
Florida, by the US media giant Time Warner is calculated to terrify. In this
system of the future, the number of channels is theoretically limitless:
hundreds, thousands or even millions - as many channels as the system has
users.
The immediately striking part of the new system - installed on a test basis
in a handful of Florida homes - is so-called video on demand.
Suppose you want to watch the film Basic Instinct. You call it up with your
remote control, press the button and it starts immediately. If the phone
rings, you stop the film. If you get to a boring bit, you skip forward or
rewind.
As Time Warner's chairman, Mr Gerald Levin, told reporters in Orlando on
Wednesday, the aim is to do everything a conventional video recorder can do,
without having to go out and rent the video.
In itself, that is a trivial improvement. But it has profound implications
for home entertainment services. The system works by storing films in a kind
of digital warehouse, from which they can be instantly recalled. Just as the
whole contents of the Library of Congress could eventually be stored
digitally for access by computer users, so a system like Time Warner's could
ultimately contain every film ever made.
The system also contains home shopping. Conventional US home shopping
channels, such as QVC, offer products at the times the broadcaster decides.
If the channel is showing DIY goods when you want children's toys, hard
luck.
The Time Warner system takes you into a mock-up of a shopping mall and walks
you around. When you get to the right store, you press the button and go in.
The Chrysler showroom shows you the latest models; for technical details,
press the button and they appear from the printer next to the TV set. Go
into the post office, and you can order a book of stamps to be delivered
with your mail the next morning, or ask for a postman to pick up a parcel
within three hours.
Or take video games. The system has the usual state-of-the-art arcade games,
where you roam around corridors shooting at things. But it also lets you
play games with other people. Wednesday's demonstration in Orlando offered
the curious spectacle of the chairman of Time Warner playing a hand of gin
rummy with a family on the other side of town.
As Time Warner insists, all this is merely illustrative. Nobody knows what
kind of services consumers will want, or how much they will pay for them.
Now the system is set up, it will be used as a test-bed. Over the coming
months, up to 4,000 homes will be plugged in, and their inhabitants watched
like laboratory rats.
Early in the new year will come news on demand: if you arrive home 10
minutes late for the six o'clock news, you can still call it up from the
beginning. Next will arrive sports on demand, music and educational
services.
As Time Warner says, the applications are practically limitless, at any rate
in theory. The printer can provide you with a catalogue, a theatre ticket or
an individually compiled home newspaper. It all depends on what people want.
The answer to that will also determine whether Time Warner has wasted a
great deal of money. The project was first announced early last year, and is
badly behind schedule. It has also been roundly condemned in parts of the US
press as an unaffordable white elephant.
At Wednesday's grand-scale demonstration, the sense of relief among Time
Warner executives as the system went through its paces was almost palpable.
The project may lack believers, but at least it works.
How much money is at stake is a matter for conjecture. According to Mr
Levin, Time Warner will invest Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3bn) in round terms over
the next five years. But as he is also careful to point out, most of the
money would have been spent anyway in upgrading its existing cable network.
As a result of competitive pressure within the cable industry, Time Warner
and its rivals are already investing heavily in broadband networks, based on
optical fibre, which will provide a better version of their existing
service. This technology has as its by-product an enormous increase in
capacity. Much of the innovation by the cable companies is an attempt to put
that spare capacity to work.
The next step is to take on the telephone companies. From the middle of next
year, Time Warner will be using its fibre optic system to provide a local
telephone service to businesses in the Orlando area (it is already doing
this in New York).
Eventually, when the regulations that currently prevent cable companies from
offering telephone services more widely permit, it will do the same for the
general public. And, of course, the telephone companies will be moving into
cable.
In the early stages of this revolution, the new services demonstrated this
week will be no more than the icing on the cake. Mr Levin candidly admits he
does not know how successful they will prove.
'There are so many opportunities that I'm not smart enough to know what they
are,' he says. Or, as a colleague puts it, 'even if the big winner is a
business nobody's thought of yet, that's OK. It'll still have to come down
the broadband pipe.'
Two central questions remain. First, as the explosion of channels is
duplicated across the nation, what will be found to fill them? Second, the
average American family spends a great deal of its time in front of the TV
set already. How much time will families have to spend to feed the monster
which is being created?
The first question is probably a matter of timing. The growth in
distribution channels has been so sudden that it has outpaced the ability of
the entertainment industry to supply it. But American popular culture is
robust, and many of the entertainment giants are scrambling to catch up.
The second question is less certain. Already in parts of the US, the only
observable form of life is the car, shuttling between the shopping mall, the
school and the office. In time, the TV could render even the car redundant.
If Orlando is the future, the American's home could end up not so much his
castle as his prison.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bringing right people to account for
malpractice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GUY DEHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I fear John Mason's article ('Corporate manslaughter verdict poses
legal dilemma', December 13) on corporate manslaughter following the
conviction in the Lyme Bay canoe trial misses the point.
Months before the disaster two instructors had written to the managing
director about safety at the centre, warning that unless something was done
'you might find yourself trying to explain why someone's son or daughter
will not be coming home'.
At the trial, Mr Justice Ognall made it clear that it was the failure to
heed this warning that separated this case from any other of its kind. No
doubt it was also relevant to the managing director's jail term.
If any of the five warnings about the Herald fleet sailing with bow doors
open had been addressed to the managing director or board of P&amp;O, the case
in the Zeebrugge prosecution might well have been put to the jury. As it was
those warnings got lost in middle management. The key point, then, is with
whom a serious concern is raised, rather than merely the size of the
organisation.
The message from this case is that an effective check on serious malpractice
in the workplace is to make sure that those in charge know of it.
Increasingly responsible leaders in the public and private sectors are open
to such concerns and address them properly.
They know it is only right that, when people in their positions have actual
notice of any unwarranted dangers, they can and should expect to account for
their response.
If the law or good business provided otherwise, they would do little to
promote the doctrine of accountability in organisations or to protect the
public.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Fizz goes out of office revels: Christmas parties are too
dear for some UK companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lehman Brothers is trimming back the tinsel this year: it has cancelled the
Christmas party for its London staff.
The decision has brought some grumbles, and provoked some 'underground'
events, but it seems that the US investment bank is not alone in taking a
cost-benefit approach to festive fun.
Despite the recovery in the UK economy, jollity is a commodity that some
companies are finding too expensive. They want to maintain staff morale, and
the image projected by a high-profile celebration is important, but many are
considering carefully how much pleasure it is worth paying for.
A survey of 130 businesses by Reed Personnel Services revealed that 81 per
cent of companies were still planning office parties this year, but
approximately half said they expected them to be less extravagant than in
the boom years.
As Mr William Deakin, owner of Juliana's party designers, says: 'Parties in
the 1980s were very lavish with unlimited budgets for alcohol and perhaps
included cabarets. Now people cut out themes and cabarets, and after a
certain point the guests have to pay for their own booze.'
In some sectors an extravagant Christmas party continues to be justified as
a status symbol and a display of creative skills. Ms Wendy Riches, managing
director of advertising agency Ogilvy and Mather, for example, says that
recent Christmas parties have involved the staff dressing up as animals to
visit the zoo, and gambling fake money in casinos. 'We are a bright, sparky
agency so we have to do something bright and sparky,' she explains.
But even among advertising and public relations agencies, the emphasis has
shifted away from sheer expenditure towards greater innovation. 'How much
staff enjoy a party often has nothing to do with how much money is spent,'
Ms Riches insists.
The desire to stage a shared celebration as a way of engendering corporate
spirit is also still strong. Morgan Stanley held a lavish staff party in
Chelsea this year, while its bond traders celebrated among waxworks in
Madame Tussauds. It also held a client party at the Royal Academy - a venue
that costs Pounds 3,500 to hire, before catering costs.
Securities house Robert Fleming, which has been increasing its staff
recently, held a dinner for more than 1,000 people at the Grosvenor House
Hotel - an event which, according to the hotel's official price list, would
normally cost about Pounds 33,000.
'Our most valuable asset is our people. We believe that a party like this is
valuable because it brings people together - many of our staff are very
specialised, and never have a chance to meet each other,' says Robert
Fleming.
But as City groups have expanded, some have found that engendering corporate
togetherness is no longer feasible. Stockbroker Nomura International's guest
list, for example, has risen to more than 1,400 in the past couple of years
as the company has expanded. It now has difficulty cramming its staff and
partners into a venue without dividing them into separate rooms - and thus
dividing any corporate spirit.
'We have been thinking about cost cutting,' Nomura explained. The lack of
any suitable large venue in London clinched its decision to abandon its main
staff party this year, it says.
Ford UK, the car manufacturer, has never funded staff Christmas parties,
precisely because of the problem of size. The company used to have 50,000
employees, and it was impossible to fund a party for all of them, the
management argues - but it would have been divisive if it had funded a party
for a few.
The fear that a party might generate more ill-will than good appears to have
been a motivating factor for other companies. They are worried about
appearing profligate. The phenomenon of the extravagant of-fice party is
anyway particularly British. 'You don't see drunken crowds wearing black tie
on the streets in Paris at Christmas like you often see around the City,'
notes a trader with a French bank in London.
UK companies are more aware of how their customers might view an expensive
party. East Midlands Electricity, which recently announced a special interim
dividend worth Pounds 186m, is sticking to its traditional Christmas lunch -
courtesy of the company canteen and funded by the staff themselves. 'If you
think we are all living lavishly in the privatised sector, that would be
wrong,' the company says.
Government departments such as the Treasury have long relied on Christmas
spirit to overcome their restrained party budgets. The Treasury's public
expenditure group, for example, this year had a party featuring karaoke to
enliven an otherwise modest affair.
For small companies, Christmas parties continue to play a vital role,
particularly at a time of weak employee confidence.
'The benefits of a party for staff morale are very great,' says Mr Charles
Madden of specialist broking house European American Securities. Last year
the company had a Christmas meal in a Chinese restaurant. This year,
however, the six employees, plus partners, travelled to Paris to celebrate.
'Paying for a weekend in Paris might sound a bit ritzy, but it's good value
if you compare it with the goodwill it creates - particularly when a meal
might normally cost Pounds 50 a head anyway.'
But as the spending bonanza of the 1980s becomes a distant memory, a more
cost-conscious approach seems likely to spread further in the private
sector. Corporate Christmas frolics remain entrenched. But crackers, rather
than champagne, seem likely to be the hallmark of the British Christmas
party this decade.

<TEXT>
Sir, Nicholas Lander's guide to restaurant guides ('Christmas Food and
Drink', December 10/11) fails to mention a significant difference between
the various guides.
For the discerning diner who enjoys the subtle aromas of food and wine,
freedom from the intrusion and irritation of smoke is desirable. Among the
guides, Harden's and Which? report most consistently on whether a restaurant
boasts a no-smoking section.
It is much more convenient to have this information in the guide than to
waste time telephoning one restaurant after another, in search of this
ultimate in gracious dining.

leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir BRYAN CARSBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In their letter of December 14, Hugh Raven and Professor Tim Lang call
for intervention by me to end the current 'price war' between the
supermarkets. They cited price cutting on turkeys as a cause for concern.
Price competition is very important to the consumer; without it, there would
be fewer bargains to shop for, and fewer new products and services would get
off the ground. Even where the competition takes the form of discounted
prices, including loss leaders, I am therefore reluctant to intervene in the
operation of the market without convincing evidence of collusive or
otherwise clearly anti-competitive behaviour. I do not believe that loss
leading on selected products - as opposed to uneconomic pricing of the whole
range of product - can be expected to drive rivals out of business and
reduce competition to the detriment of consumers.
I therefore do not regard the facts reported in the letter as sufficient
evidence to justify intervention, though my office continues to keep a close
watch on developments in the retail grocery sector.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Stranded by a Labour tide: Philip Stephens examines the
ramifications of a crushing by-election defeat for the UK Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS EXAMINES THE RAMIFICATIONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By-elections do not change the tide of history. They do tell us which way,
and how fast, the tide is flowing.
After the defeat in Dudley West, this government is as close as any postwar
administration to drowning in the breaking waves.
Everyone knew the result would be bad. In the event it was awful.
Conservatives now always seem to exceed their worst expectations. Ministers
may mutter about a low by-election turnout and mid-term protest votes blues.
But the 29 per cent swing from Tory to Labour - or new Labour, as Mr Tony
Blair insists his party must now be called - was the largest since 1935.
Scratch beneath the surface of the opinion polls, and it is clear the
electorate has not embraced the Labour cause with enthusiasm.
Many remain uncertain of Mr Blair's prospectus. But the fear that has kept
the opposition party out of government for so long is fast dissipating.
One minister confessed he had not found a single Tory voter in the Midlands
constituency, after half a day on the stump (it was all he could stand).
A former cabinet member chimed in that the electorate in this sensible patch
of middle England regarded the Tory party as a shambles. Surveying the
warring factions on the backbenches and the disunity in the cabinet, he
found it hard to disagree.
Neither man had to ask why the government was more unpopular than at any
time during the past 15 years.
The economic recovery is well-balanced, with inflation low and growth driven
by exports rather than consumption. It is not being felt where it counts,
though. Higher taxes, a squeeze on wages, and job insecurity have depressed
both the incomes and the confidence of the voters.
The disenchantment is reinforced by the spectacle of a party preoccupied
with its own political infighting rather than the concerns of those it
promised to represent. The defeat over value added tax on fuel - smack in
the middle of the by-election campaign - epitomises the problem.
An out-of-touch government was determined to double the level of the most
unpopular measure since the ill-fated poll tax. The measure was abandoned
not because ministers had listened to the voters but because their hand was
forced by backbench Tory rebels.
Dudley West, one of the swathe of Midlands seats that will decide the
outcome of the next general election, has been Tory since 1979. A mix of the
old industrial and more prosperous residential areas now typical of the
black country, the constituency is a natural home for the skilled workers -
the aspiring C1s - who turned to Mrs Margaret Thatcher during the 1980s.
The boundaries will be redrawn before the next general election. But if
Labour holds on to seats like this, Mr Blair will replace Mr John Major in
10 Downing Street.
Ministers yesterday were primed with excuses. This was a mid-term protest -
louder maybe than some before it, but a protest nonetheless. Mr John Major's
government, like others before it, would be forgiven once the recovery began
to put money into the voter's pockets.
Look at the history, they said. The government lost seven by-elections
during the last parliament. Every seat was recovered in 1992.
Remember Mid-Staffordshire? Labour under the leadership of Mr Neil Kinnock
won that Midlands seat in March 1990 with a massive 21 per cent swing. At
the 1992 general election it was returned safely to Tory hands.
Go back further. In November 1981, Mrs Shirley Williams grabbed Crosby for
the now-defunct Social Democratic Party with a 25.6 per cent swing against
the Conservatives. The chattering classes were convinced that her victory
marked the beginning of the end of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's government. A
year later, Mrs Thatcher won the war in the Falkland Islands. A year after
that she won an impregnable 144-seat majority.
But there are many threatening precedents also. The Labour government's
crushing mid-term defeat in the mining constituency of Ashfield in 1977
foreshadowed the mass desertion of its traditional supporters two years
later.
The Conservatives' loss of Orpington in the 1962 by-election was the
precursor to the end, two years later, of 13 years of Tory rule. Mr Edward
Heath's loss of the Isle of Ely in mid-1973 provided a similar premonition
of impending doom in February 1974.
Closer to home, the by-election defeats of the last parliament may not have
dislodged the Conservatives from power. But the succession of ever-more
disastrous losses from mid-1989 onwards was a sign that the tide had gone
out for Mrs Thatcher's brand of Conservatism. She went.
Mrs Thatcher, of course, had a majority of 100. Technically, Mr Major has
headed a minority government since the suspension of nine Tory Eurosceptics
from the party whip. Even if they are eventually brought back into the fold,
the government's majority would rise to just 13. A few more by-elections and
it could vanish.
For now the support of nine Ulster Unionists improves the arithmetic. As
long as the prime minister retains their confidence over the peace process
in Northern Ireland, the unionists are ready to sustain him in in office.
But more convulsions are threatened on the Tory backbenches. Europhobes and
Europhiles have drawn battlelines for the 1996 European Union conference on
the next stage of integration. Mr Major's hint of a referendum was designed
to encourage a truce. Instead it threatens a still more protracted battle.
The factionalism stretches well beyond the divide over Europe. There are pro
and anti-Major camps, radicals and consolidators, self-appointed holders of
the Thatcherite torch and the merely disgruntled and dispossessed. Like the
factions that nearly destroyed Labour in the early 1980s, these cliques see
party infighting as a way of life. The Tory coalition is on the edge of
disintegration.
The divisions have spread to the cabinet. Mr Major does not have a grip over
his colleagues. He is unable to prevent them from promoting their own
agendas, personal and political.
To listen, say, to Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, and to Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is to imagine two politicians from different
political continents. Both are contenders for the future Tory leadership.
Neither seems willing to call a halt to the sniping that could destroy their
inheritance.
Publicly, cabinet ministers insist the divisions can be bridged, the wounds
healed. But in private moments, the same ministers are surprisingly candid
in contemplating the party's self-destruction.
One of Mr Major's colleagues ventured this week that defeat at the general
election was inevitable unless the party managed to seal the fissures. And
defeat, he suggested, would be followed by a holocaust that would deprive
the Conservatives of power for 15, maybe 20, years.
Forget about turning tides, he said. Mr Major's successor would inherit a
funeral pyre.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Government must accept risks in
encouraging small companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL SNYDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Our confusion between 're-enervating' and 're-energising' the British
entrepreneur, spotted by Observer in his column ('English disease', December
9) may have been a subconscious reflection of our lack of real enthusiasm
for the government's policy towards small companies.
As accountants specialising in advising owner-managed businesses, we welcome
the additional measures introduced in the Budget. However, our fundamental
problem remains to be tackled: lack of finance for small companies. The new
Venture Capital Trusts, for reasons of management economics, will prefer to
make funds available in chunks of hundreds of thousands of pounds rather
than the tens of thousands required by really small enterprises.
One answer lies in the Loan Guarantee Scheme, which the chancellor has
promised to review. The fact that since the beginning of this financial year
only Pounds 121.75m has been lent under this scheme shows how ineffective
and hamstrung by red tape it currently is.
The government must make dramatic changes to simplify procedures and broaden
its availability. In doing so it must recognise that it cannot expect to go
unscathed - reasonable risks must be taken and some losses will be incurred.
But unless a real commitment is made in this way, the small business sector
will never make the contribution to prosperity and employment that it could.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bizarre airport charge formula
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DERMOT COX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Des Wilson is right (Letters, December 14) that BAA's landing charges
are low compared with those at airports in other countries. This is the
result of a bizarre policy by BAA's regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority,
whose response to BAA's monopoly has been to force it to cut its charges
over the past two years (the retail price index minus 8 formula).
We have a situation at Heathrow where the demand for slots far exceeds
supply and where the airport is the largest single source of noise and air
pollution in London - yet charges are going down] The correct regulatory
solution is to allow market clearing prices and tax BAA's excess profits.
This special treatment of the air transport industry is also seen in the
exemption of airlines from paying any duty or tax on the fuel they use -
contrast the government's determination to put VAT on domestic power and the
massive levy on petrol and diesel.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Policing the utilities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a palpable sense of national unease about the activities of many of
Britain's privatised utilities.
It is symbolised by the decision of British Gas to station security guards
outside its showrooms to deflect the wrath of customers angry at the
withdrawal of services. Something seems awry in a world where senior
managers get 75 per cent salary increases while seeking to cut the pay of
their employees; where massive redundancy programmes run alongside
accelerating profits; and where shareholders - yesterday it was the turn of
Yorkshire Electricity's lucky investors - receive large payouts while
consumers feel they are paying over the odds to what remain monopoly
suppliers of essential services.
Not all the privatised companies are in the dock. British
Telecommunications, after a period of deep unpopularity in the late 1980s,
attracts favourable ratings.
The contrast between BT and the gas, water and electricity companies
explains the unpopularity of the last three. The salary of BT chairman Sir
Iain Vallance was notorious while BT was an inefficient, expensive monopoly.
Now BT's prices are falling fast; telecoms regulation is seen to be tough;
competition between phone operators is a reality in the consumer market; and
although a heavy BT redundancy programme is in progress, consumers, not
shareholders, are regarded as the main beneficiaries.
By contrast, water prices have gone up sharply since privatisation. Gas
prices are to rise for many consumers over the next year. Electricity prices
are falling somewhat, but by nowhere near the decline in the cost of
distribution - the main source of the regional electricity companies'
profits. And in none of the three industries is competition yet a reality
for most consumers. In water, it will never become so.
Caught in the cross-fire
In addition, jobs have been shed at a dramatic rate, while dividends and top
managers' salaries have risen sharply. It only took the egregious
provocation of Mr Cedric Brown's 75 per cent salary increase as chief
executive of British Gas, at the same time as the company is seeking to cut
the basic pay and holiday entitlement of its showroom staff, for MPs to
start calling for public inquiries. The employment select committee this
week decided to investigate executive pay in the new year.
How justified is the concern?
In some respects, the utilities are doing no more than ministerial bidding.
The gas and electricity companies were caught in the cross-fire over the
government's unpopular decision - now partially abandoned - to levy 17.5 per
cent value added tax on domestic fuel. The increase in water charges has
been caused in part by onerous EU directives on water quality, which the
government tried too late to persuade Brussels to reconsider.
That still leaves the fundamental issues of executive pay and the balance
which the gas, water, and electricity companies have struck between their
employees, shareholders and consumers.
Unconvincing claims
The arguments about executive pay have been extensively rehearsed in our
letters column with respect to Mr Brown. Managers must be paid according to
responsibility, and multi-billion industries need to be able to attract
top-flight executives. But it is hard to claim that large salary increases
and generous share options are required to 'incentivise' individuals who
were already willingly in post. It is equally unconvincing to claim that
executives need to be rewarded for managing a shift towards competition and
business abroad, which has largely still to happen. The public feeling that
it comes down to greed is difficult to resist.
On cost cutting, the utilities should be offered nothing but applause. In
almost all cases, redundancies have been voluntary and on generous terms.
The benefit to the nation as a whole from lower utility prices must outweigh
any temptation to use the utilities as a source of unproductive employment.
Britain has the lowest business telecoms prices of its main European
competitors - a significant factor in the competitiveness of its financial
services sector, upon which hundreds of thousands of jobs depend.
However, in other utilities too much of the gain from improvements in
efficiency has gone to shareholders instead of consumers. This is manifestly
the case with the regional electricity companies. Interim dividends up to 47
per cent higher than last year are currently being announced. The water and
electricity companies have done far better than expected in their cost
cutting, but virtually all independent observers believe the regulatory
regime established at the privatisation of the two industries was unduly
slack, and has been insufficiently tightened in the latest reviews.
The boards of the utilities should have greater regard for public
sensibilities in setting their salary levels. But it is the regulators who
ought to ensure that a fairer balance is struck between consumers and
shareholders.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Man in the News: Power in the background - Simon Keswick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Simon Keswick, chairman of Trafalgar House, announced this week that
the company was contemplating the first hostile bid for a privatised UK
utility, he was putting himself under the spotlight.
He studiously avoids personal publicity. But a contested bid for Northern
Electric would bring the kind of attention from the financial press that the
tabloids reserve for National Lottery winners.
As the Labour party has already pointed out, the main reason Northern is an
attractive takeover target is the benign regulatory regime enjoyed by all
the regional electricity companies. The companies have made substantial
profits under the pricing regime put in place at privatisation.
A bid would also raise eyebrows in the City, where analysts question whether
it would be in the interest of the majority of Trafalgar's shareholders.
They argue that it would be driven by the needs of Hongkong Land, the 25 per
cent shareholder and an offshoot of the Jardine Matheson international
trading house, which is one of Hong Kong's largest businesses and is
controlled by the Keswick family. Jardine is trying to expand outside Hong
Kong before the Chinese takeover in 1997.
If to comes to a bid funded by Trafalgar shares, the defence will focus on
the record of Simon Keswick and the rest of Trafalgar's new management team.
Keswick has already come under considerable attack from the Chinese
government in the context of a deteriorating relationship with Jardine.
The Chinese authorities delight in remembering Jardine's origins as 19th
century opium dealers and describe it now as 'a looter' and a 'bad element'.
The animosity is both the cause and the effect of Jardine's efforts to
reduce its reliance on the colony.
Jardine's suspicion of the Chinese, born of the losses it suffered when the
communists took control on the mainland in 1947, has led it to move Jardine
Matheson's domicile from Hong Kong to Bermuda. At the end of this year it
intends to delist its shares in Hong Kong. Two years ago, it adopted
Trafalgar House as its main UK vehicle.
Although these moves might seem a sensible insurance policy, Simon, and to a
greater extent his eldest brother Henry, have been criticised for
antagonising the Chinese unnecessarily. Some observers also believe that the
Keswicks have failed to capitalise on opportunities in and around Hong Kong
in recent years. But few deny Simon's achievement in turning the empire
around in the mid-1980s.
When he was installed as taipan (chairman and chief executive) in 1983, the
web of Jardine companies was overextended, overborrowed and overcomplicated.
'He presided over the restoration of the whole of the Jardine group and the
creation of a modern conglomerate with almost no debt,' says one colleague.
Until then, he had been seen as something of a socialite, without Henry's
business or political acumen. According to unkind critics, Henry got the
brains while Simon got the looks.
Some still question how much credit he should get for Jardine's
transformation. 'It was very much a team effort as he would be the first to
admit,' says one former colleague.
But all agree that, among his other qualities, he is a good judge of
management talent. 'He has a record of bringing on good people, like Nigel
Rich,' says one Jardine adviser. Rich has just moved from the helm of
Jardine Matheson to become chief executive of Trafalgar House.
Having installed Rich at Jardines, Simon moved back to the UK while
remaining chairman of key subsidiaries Hongkong Land, Mandarin Hotels and
Dairy Farm (the colony's biggest grocer and 29 per cent shareholder in Kwik
Save). He is also a director of Hanson.
Educated at Eton and Cambridge (briefly), he is a typical establishment
figure: charming, unassuming, courteous and conventional (apart from his
passionate support for Tottenham Hotspur).
'He is quiet, even in private, and not immediately very impressive,' says
one business associate.
Given his background, friends say he is remarkably humble. 'He believes that
self-promotion is very dangerous because people start to believe the
publicity. While he is very confident in his own judgment, and has an
ability to get to the heart of a business problem quickly, he is very
conscious that the success of the business depends largely on the rest of
the team.'
Friends say that Trafalgar House has given him the new challenge he needs.
Hongkong Land took its stake in Trafalgar in 1992 as the engineering and
property conglomerate built up by Sir Nigel Broackes was struggling. It soon
became clear that Trafalgar's financial state was much worse than previously
thought. Over the next 18 months Hongkong Land engineered a financial rescue
that saw shareholders inject more than Pounds 700m to keep the group afloat.
The old management was eased out and Hongkong Land took effective control,
although it owns only 25 per cent of Trafalgar's ordinary shares.
This is very much the Keswick way - the family calls the shots around the
empire, although it owns less than 10 per cent of Jardine Matheson's shares.
Such power wielded by minority shareholders tends to be frowned upon in
London.
If Trafalgar does bid for Northern Electric, the target is bound to argue
that shareholders in both companies are being asked to dance to Jardine's
tune.
Northern is also likely to question Hongkong Land's judgment over its move
on Trafalgar House, given the scale of the problems that subsequently
emerged, and the attacks could well get personal.
Although Rich will be on the frontline, some of the shots are bound to be
aimed at Simon Keswick. But friends insist he will not respond. 'That is
just not his style.'
'He may be basically shy but he is not thin-skinned. People have been saying
nasty things about Jardine for 150 years,' says an adviser.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Race to escape the juggernaut: President Clinton is fighting
back against attempts by the Republicans to marginalise him
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has come down to this. When the Democratic president of the US goes on
national television for what is universally agreed to be a very important
speech, as Bill Clinton did on Thursday night, the Republican party does not
even bother to field a heavy hitter to deliver its statutory response.
Instead of a Dole, a Gingrich or a Gramm, it offers the country Fred Dalton
Thompson.
In fact, Mr Thompson, elected to the Senate from Tennessee last month in the
Republican midterm landslide, is a familiar face on TV, mostly because he
was an actor. He therefore delivered his lines well and one sentence said it
all: 'From what we heard tonight, the president's vision of the future now
looks a lot like what Republicans just campaigned for - at least until we
start looking at the details.'
Earlier in the day, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who is enough of a
Republican heavyweight that he will soon declare his presidential candidacy,
had dispensed with even the pretence of politesse. Whatever Mr Clinton
proposed would be 'a non-starter', he intoned, as he outlined his party's
minimum tax cut positions.
On Wednesday, Senator Robert Dole and Congressman Newt Gingrich,
respectively majority leader and Speaker in the next Congress, wrote to the
president, not only presuming to tell him what he ought to say but also
warning him of the consequences of not signing up to the Republican agenda.
'The American people aren't the only ones watching,' they said. 'So is the
world and its young democracies emerging from generations of government
oppression.'
The game now afoot in Washington is the attempted marginalisation of the
chief executive by the suddenly ascendant Republican majority. It is a
high-risk strategy, conducted with a mixture of boldness, arrogance and
certitude that goes far beyond even the sweeping ambitions of the early
years of Ronald Reagan's presidency, tempered as they were by the fact that
at least the Democrats still ran the powerful House of Representatives.
It is predicated on the conviction, as yet untested by time, that an angry
and bitter country has run out of sympathy with Bill Clinton and fallen head
over heels for the new conservative orthodoxy. The latest piece of evidence
was a New York Times public opinion poll this week which found a far greater
inclination to trust Congress with the nation's affairs than the president,
whose approval rating was below 40 per cent.
The poll also revealed much ignorance about the Republican 'Contract with
America' (and even about Mr Gingrich himself) and less enthusiasm for some
of its more extreme propositions, but that message was for the moment
secondary.
In fairness, Mr Clinton has not been in hiding since his electoral debacle.
He has attended three summits - two of which (the Asian one in Jakarta and
the American version in Miami) may be deemed successful, while the failure
of the third (in Budapest about eastern Europe) was hardly his fault. He led
the fight last month for congressional passage of the Gatt trade treaty.
Yet, allowing for dutiful media coverage of the above, the real headlines
have been culled from every syllable dropped from the non-stop lips of
Messrs Gingrich, Dole and Gramm and their acolytes.
This has led to the powerful perception of a president on the ropes. As RW
Apple put it in the New York Times this week, 'he has been dangerously
silent until now. He has left the initiative to Republicans . . . their
confidence and audacity has deepened the Democrats' demoralisation; a
Democratic senator said this week: 'it's hard to see how we escape from this
wilderness''.
His own party has turned on him. Dave McCurdy, the overweeningly ambitious
ex-congressman from Oklahoma still smarting from his own defeat for the
Senate, described his old colleague-in-arms in the struggle for the
Democratic middle ground as 'a transitional figure'. This week, Richard
Gephardt, the new minority leader in the House, rose from a sickbed to
present his own middle-class tax cut proposals without waiting for his
president, thus staking out the independence of the congressional party from
the administration. A Los Angeles Times poll found two-thirds of Democrats
hoping Mr Clinton would be challenged for the party presidential nomination
in 1996. With friends like these, the president hardly needs Republican
enemies.
But real friends have been deserting him, too. It was no secret that Lloyd
Bentsen wanted to leave the Treasury after two hard and successful years,
but even his departure somehow could not wait until the dog days of
Christmas. Equally David Gergen, all-round counsellor, was known to be
going, though, typically, he departed with some ambiguous comments about the
president's soul. Yesterday Dee Dee Myers, the first woman White House press
secretary, confirmed that she, too, would be out by the end of the year.
Less easy to explain is the speed with which Mr Clinton ditched Dr Joycelyn
Elders, his surgeon general. Black, outspoken and from Arkansas, she has
long figured at the top of the conservative hit list for her blunt
discourses on Aids, drugs and sex. She went after saying during a speech at
the UN that masturbation was properly a part of sex education; her comments
went unreported at the time, but the White House sacked her once it came out
that a news magazine was about to make a retrospective meal out of the
incident.
This left the impression that just about everybody close to or distant from
the president was now fair game and that he would do little to protect them.
George Stephanopoulos, the trusted presidential adviser, is in the
Republican gunsights as a symbol of outdated liberalism. Rumours persist
that Jim Woolsey, head of the troubled CIA, and Tony Lake, national security
adviser, are living on borrowed time.
A midterm reshuffle of portfolios is normal, but this one, when it comes,
will also have to run a Republican gauntlet in Congress (though Robert
Rubin, Treasury secretary-designate, should be safe). Each appointment up
for confirmation will be turned into a debate on political and social
principles, no light prospect for a president accused of lacking core
beliefs.
No subject now consumes the media more than the political soul of Bill
Clinton, especially in contrast to the certitudes of Mr Gingrich. Much like
John Major in Britain, the president has few defenders in the fourth estate,
the difference in the commentary of the two countries lying more in the
degree of venom directed at the person and character of Mr Clinton. A
popular Washington talk radio programme after the speech on Thursday night
was consumed by the most demeaning criticisms ('he's just a scared boy,' one
caller said, with no demur from the hosts).
A thoughtful article by Adam Gopnik in a recent New Yorker magazine
accurately noted that 'however you feel about Bill Clinton, no other
American president since the 1870s has been hung up by his thumbs so soon
and left there to hang for so long'. The author found the fault to lie
mostly in the media, consumed with instant judgments, appearances over
substance and lacking any real political convictions of its own, beyond a
spurious pretence of objectivity. Even William Safire, the conservative but
never predictable New York Times columnist, suggested this week that a
closer reading of some of Mr Clinton's overlooked recent remarks proved he
was 'alive and well and living in the White House' and ready for the
Republican challenge.
But more typical of the prevailing media mood was a column by Meg
Greenfield, the influential editorial page editor of the notionally liberal
Washington Post. She wrote that it would be as dangerous for liberals to
underestimate Newt Gingrich as they once had Ronald Reagan ('if they just
holler and mock and talk about Hitler and relevant things like that,
Gingrich wins'). Her article could be read as an overture to the new Speaker
that could lead to an editorial kindness comparable to that her newspaper
used to bestow on Mr Reagan.
Mr Clinton himself recognised the mood of the times in his speech by calling
for an end to 'the politics of personal destruction and demonisation that
have dominated too much of our debate'. Yet the contemporary reality may be
that he will have to bite back himself to survive in these shark-infested
waters.
In this respect the new Republican hierarchy presents some tempting targets,
with Mr Gingrich particularly prone to shoot off his mouth. It is, for
example, far from clear that America is ready for the recreation of
orphanages on a grand scale as an antidote to collapsed family structures.
Nothing would unite disaffected liberals (and thoughtful conservatives) so
much as his proposed elimination of federal funding for public,
non-commercial broadcasting. Nor would there appear to be much appetite for
his proposal to bomb the Bosnian Serbs back into the Stone Age. The New York
Times poll found little enthusiasm for restoring prayer in schools or
eviscerating the welfare state.
Other Republicans, too, seem consumed with the hubris of the moment and the
defensiveness of Mr Clinton, forgetting that the fault lines in a party
without a favoured presidential contender have in no way been reduced by its
electoral triumph. Mr Clinton may look vulnerable against any Republican,
but as soon as that candidate takes a human shape, different calculations
may be made.
Thus the fairest, if not the instantly popular, interpretation of Mr
Clinton's first significant response to the new political climate is not to
see it as a one-shot attempt at redemption but as the first step in a long
campaign to climb out of the political abyss. He offered a few modest tax
cuts that may not survive the light of day and a short homily on America's
crisis of confidence, all wrapped up in 10 minutes and in sum hardly
amounting to Lincoln's Gettysburg address, which was also very short.
But if the Republicans are playing the game hard, Mr Clinton must also play
it long. If and when Fred Thompson ceases to be the opposition's designated
hitter, then the notoriously unpredictable political pendulum, forecasts of
which are a mug's game these days, may be swinging back again.
