FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of Slovakia (8): The voice of reassurance
</HEADLINE>

Sergej Kozlik has the task of putting the best possible face on the HZDS and
its economic policies, writes ANTHONY ROBINSON.
He is anxious to reassure potential foreign investors worried at the
prospect of a HZDS-led coalition government supported by xenophobic
nationalists and a working class movement demanding higher pay and lower
unemployment.
'We simply cannot make concessions to the ZRS workers' association which
would lead to the loss of macro-economic stability and probably bring down
the government yet again,' he says. 'We are looking for compromises from
them which would ensure long term growth. We cannot allow wage increases
without higher productivity but we can and will reform the social security
system to focus benefits on the really needy,' he adds.
According to Mr Kozlik, the HZDS has three economic priorities: higher
public investment in highways; infrastructure and telecommunications;
stabilisation of the agricultural sector and encouragement of exports and
the entrepreneurial sector. For good measure, the HZDS policymaker adds
banking sector reform.
He does not include privatisation but it has been a point of contention
between the HZDS and the Moravcik government which cancelled some of the
sell-offs rushed through in the last days of the Meciar government but whose
own privatisation policies were bitterly criticised by Mr Meciar.
'In substance there are no real differences between the Moravcik government
and the HZDS over privatisation. The differences are in the detail. We do
not think that a majority of shares in companies should be distributed
through the voucher privatisation method, but at least 51 per cent of a
company should be in the hands of a clearly defined owner.'
He is also sceptical about the role of investment funds which now have
shares of 200 of the largest Slovak enterprises in their portfolios. 'Funds
may be good at managing portfolios but what we need are people who know how
to manage the enterprises,' he says. This is why the HZDS tends to favour
management and worker buyouts rather than the dispersion of ownership
through coupon privatisation and corporate governance in the hands of
investment funds, he adds.
He is quick to pledge that coupon privatisation will continue, given the
enthusiastic public response to the Moravcik government's launch of the
second round of mass privatisation through vouchers. But he insists that the
scale and volume of privatisation through the mass privatisation programme
will change with greater emphasis on trade sales and other more conventional
privatisation methods.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of Slovakia (7): Sausages and charisma - Meciar, the
old warhorse, triumphs again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the last weekend of September Slovak voters had the first chance to
register their verdict on the political record since independence.
When the general election votes were counted, Vladimir Meciar, who led
Slovakia into a divorce from the Czech republic in January 1993, re-emerged
as the dominant personality in Slovak politics. Once again Slovak voters
voted in large numbers for a charismatic leader whose style and personality
belongs more to the tub-thumping era of the past than the pragmatic, problem
solving approach of modern political parties.
His Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) won nearly 35 per cent of
votes cast and 61 seats in the 150 seat parliament, more than three times
the share of the vote gained by its nearest rival, the Party of the
Democratic Left (SLD), whose reformed communist leaders had hoped to emerge
as the new hegemonist political force in the country.
The vote was a personal triumph for Mr Meciar, who lost the premiership for
the second time after a parliamentary defeat in March, and a humiliating set
back for all his political enemies and rivals - including the president, Mr
Michal Kovac, and Mr Jozef Moravcik, prime minister of the coalition
government which replaced him in March.
Mr Moravcik, a former communist and academic who acted as the last foreign
minister of Czechoslovakia, earned Mr Meciar's implacable enmity by
defecting from the HZDS in 1993.
Encouraged behind the scenes by President Kovac, he helped to topple his
former leader in March and put together a broad based coalition. It ranged
from the reform communists of the SLD through to the christian democrats of
the KDH led by Mr Jan Carnogursky and included Mr Moravcik's own Democratic
Union, made up of dissident HZDS people and small liberal democratic
groupings.
The Moravcik government, which always saw itself as a stop-gap affair to
hold the reins before new elections, brought a new and more conciliatory
style to Slovak politics, raised the new republic's image abroad and
presided over a substantial recovery in the Slovak economy which began in
the fourth quarter of 1993.
However, the decision of the SLD, led by Mr Petr Weiss, to join forces with
catholics and liberal-democrats and help share the responsibility for
carrying through an IMF-approved economic policy of fiscal and monetary
austerity proved disastrous.
Instead of gaining respectability and votes by its participation in
government the SLD alienated its working class base who saw no reason to
vote for a party which shared responsibility for tight economic policies at
a time of declining real wages and high unemployment. They defected en masse
to the unashamedly 'workerist' Workers Union (ZRS) led by Jan Luptak and
Miroslav Kocnar.
A further 5.4 per cent of the electorate voted for the Slovak National Party
(SNS), the xenophobic, anti-Hungarian party led by Mr Jan Slota, the mayor
of the north Slovakian town of Zilina. Local wags call him 'Mr Zilinovsky',
a double pun on the town and the Russian nationalist firebrand Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky.
Mr Meciar spent six months fighting a no-holds barred electoral campaign
awash with beer and sausages and personal appearances in towns and villages
throughout his central Slovakian stronghold.
But he failed to win an overall majority and needs allies. He found them in
the SNS, which formally agreed to join a coalition, and the ZRS which backed
him in parliament and accepted positions in key parliamentary commissions
but declined formally to join a coalition government. Together the HZDS,
Nationalists and Workers mustered 83 seats, which gave them a working
majority but was still seven votes short of the 90 seats needed to unseat
the president and re-write the constitution.
Mr Meciar speaks of finding 'seven trusty men', like seven samurai, to give
him carte-blanche to forge a presidential system with himself at the head
rather than the parliamentary democracy outlined in the current
constitution. He also makes no secret of his desire to inflict personal
humiliation on President Kovac, another former HZDS supporter who defected
in frustration with Mr Meciar's domineering ways.
Mr Meciar's allies, such as Sergei Kozlik, the party's chief economic
spokesman, paint instead a more reassuring portrait of a rational, middle of
the road party.
He says the HZDS is fully committed to IMF-style macro-economic stability
but responds to the hopes and fears of ordinary Slovaks, especially those in
the bleak industrial towns of central Slovakia where the Soviet-era arms and
engineering plants are near to bankruptcy.
But Mr Meciar revealed a vindictive streak on the night of Thursday,
November 3, when the newly elected parliament reassembled. In a marathon
session lasting 23 hours Mr Meciar sat back and watched while his political
hatchet men and women proceeded with a purge of key office holders in
parliament and quasi-state institutions, including state radio and TV and
the privatisation agency as well as key parliamentary committees.
Mr Meciar also masterminded the setting up of a special committee to
investigate the circumstances which led to his own dismissal as prime
minister last March and passed a vote of no confidence in the privatisation
and interior minister of what at this stage was merely the caretaker
government.
Meciar allies dismiss protests as hypocritical and ask why foreign critics
in particular had not voiced similar outrage when Mr Vaclav Klaus, the
victorious Czech leader in the June 1992 elections, proceded to make a
similar clean sweep of his political opponents.
Diplomats privately reply that the difference is only superficially one of
style. In practice, the replacement of trained lawyers and other educated
office holders by poorly educated and politically untried nationalist or
workerist allies on such a scale and with such contempt shocked many
Slovaks, including opposition parties whose tacit complicity is required for
the political process to work smoothly.
Shortly after the event the German and French ambassadors called on
President Kovac to express the concern of the European Union at what is
locally known as 'bloody Thursday'. They were promptly accused of
impermissible interference in Slovakia's internal affairs by the redoubtable
Mr Slota.
But three weeks after 'bloody Thursday' voters had another opportunity to
register their views, at countrywide local elections. Mr Slota was
re-elected unopposed as mayor of Zilina.
But candidates closely associated with Mr Meciar and the HZDS performed much
worse than at the general elections. Mr Meciar may well form a new
government before Christmas. But his re-election has shocked his opponents,
forcing them to create a more effective and united opposition.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of Slovakia (9): Competition hurts - Miners hit rock
bottom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Anthony Robinson
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In communist times more than 8,000 workers were employed in the geologically
complex polymetallic ore mines around Roznava, a small town some 50km. west
of Kosice and close to the border with Hungary.
But the abolition of producer subsidies and the shift to world pricing
revealed the hopelessly uneconomic nature of most of the mines.
In a saga repeated in dozens of small towns throughout central and eastern
Slovakia thousands of miners have lost their jobs in an area of little
alternative employment as mines have been closed over the last four years or
production curtailed.
A similar fate still hangs over the Roznana mine near the town of Roznava
where the former siderite iron ore workings have already been closed and
uncertainty hangs over the potentially profitable polymetalic ore mine.
Production has already been suspended and its future will remain in doubt
until ways can be found of profitably treating a 50,000 tonne concentrated
ore stockpile and the rich ore body which still lies underground.
Two years ago Samax, the London-based parent of CMX Resources, established a
joint venture with Zelezorudne Bane, the state-owned company which runs the
Roznana mine. CMX, which was introduced to the mine while working with
Czechoslovak mining engineers in Tanzania four years ago, agreed to evaluate
the ores and seeks ways of eliminating the ecological hazards caused by the
stockpiles from which mercury had already been extracted.
But initial hopes that an Australian roasting process would solve the
problems of profitably separating the copper, silver, mercury, antimony,
arsenic and other metals proved vain.
Now CMX is experimenting with a hydro-metallic leaching process invented by
Sunshine Corporation of the US which 'could turn the mine into one of the
world's biggest producers of antimony along with 2m ounces of silver, and
smaller amounts of copper and other metals a year,' according to Mr Michael
Martineau, technical adviser to CMX on the project.
'We are fairly confident that the project will go ahead with an investment
of Dollars 10-Dollars 12m into what would be a long-life mine and treatment
facilities,' he adds. But such a decision hinges on the successful
completion of the leaching trials, and the price of antimony which is
currently at record levels.
Mr Vojtech Kral, managing director of Zelezorudne Bane, says 'we hoped that
events would move much faster, but our ores are very complex. Despite the
problems we have good co-operation with our UK partner,' he adds.
Mr Kral has successfully resisted former government plans to include the
mine in the voucher privatisation programme, arguing that it needs a real
owner who understands mining and is able to put in the capital required. He
and his management team would consider a management buy-out 'but only if the
price is one crown so that we could put new resources into developing the
mine', he says.
With bank interest rates between 18 and 22 per cent it would simply not be
possible to make the mine profitable if money had to be raised to buy
existing assets, he adds.
The only large scale mining still taking place in the Roznava area is at the
nearby Nizna Slana iron ore mine. Here 1,200 miners excavate 1m tonnes of
iron ore annually which is converted into around 450,000 tonnes of pellets
and shipped to the VSZ steel plant 40km. away.
Reserves are adequate for the next 10 to 15 years with sizeable further
deposits still to be confirmed.
The iron content of around 54 per cent is well below the 60-65 per cent
contained in the pellets which VSZ receives from Krivoi Rog in Ukraine and
costs are high because the mines are underground rather than opencast.
What keeps the mine in business is the cost difference between shipping ore
nearly 1,100km. by rail from Krivoi Rog and hauling it less than 50km. to
the steel plant which guarantees the livelihood of thousands of families
throughout eastern Slovakia and the survival of small towns such as Roznava.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (5): Minnow bucks trend
 -Profile, ERF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse of the UK's truck market in 1990 was the worst since the second
world war. Continental European markets suffered a similar collapse in 1992
and throughout last year. In these conditions, industry minnows such as ERF
are not supposed to be able to survive the savage discounting and other
market pressures exerted by the leading manufacturers.
ERF's production peaked at 4,319 in the 1989 surge and subsequently fell to
only half this level, from which it is still recovering.
Yet once again ERF and its chairman, Peter Foden, have come striding
relatively unscathed through the recessionary rubble, whereas the remains of
much larger DAF have had to be resurrected from receivership and another UK
truck-maker, AWD, has fallen subject to a takeover.
ERF, the UK's last publicly-quoted independent heavy truck maker, made a
profit of Pounds 453,000, after interest payments, in the second half of
last year. This was not sufficient to offset a first-half loss and for the
full year to April 2 there were pre-tax losses of Pounds 26,000. However,
this was still a significant improvement on the Pounds 4.12m loss of 1992.
'Margins are still pretty difficult but volumes are now rising and exports
outside Europe, particularly to south and west Africa, are looking up,'
according to Mr Foden. 'We are now making 15-16 trucks a week, compared with
10-ll at the start of the year.'
The claimed break-even level is 10-11 units a week.
'Five or 10 years ago, everyone was saying that by now ERF would have
disappeared or become just part of a big group. It hasn't happened because I
think we have a loyal UK market; the product has been well accepted after
being standardised around the Cummins (engine), Eaton (transmission) and
Rockwell (axle) drivelines; we have spent money on developing new products
and other improvements throughout the recession, and have a strong balance
sheet.'
There is an element, too, of 'keeping your head down and being a bit
stubborn', adds Mr Foden, a stocky figure with that blunt manner of speech
popularly considered archetypical of a northern entrepreneur. The business
has its headquarters in Sandbach, Cheshire.
The production increase has meant that, after a long period of retrenchment
which saw ERF's work force halved to 750, recruitment has begun again. About
150 jobs have been added this year.
With a slow but steady recovery continuing on the continent, Mr Foden
expects production to rise further, to 20-21 a week, over the next year or
so. However, this would still be well below the 30-a-week single-shift
capacity which has been created through a restructuring of operations for
greater efficiency. Cab production, for example, is now carried out at
separate facilities in nearby Middlewich.
During the past two years ERF has made its first substantive efforts to
establish a continental European sales and servicing network, starting with
France and Spain. It now has 18 French and eight Spanish distributors,
although the truck market recession in both countries has meant that sales
have been slow and ERF has yet even to launch on the Continent
left-hand-drive versions of its EC range, the development of which has
accounted for the largest portion of a Pounds 14m investment programme kept
up throughout the recession and during nearly four years of losses.
The EC trucks, covering the 15 tonnes-plus market sectors in which the
company specialises, will be launched in Europe next year, according to Mr
Foden. He maintains that as ERF's distribution network spreads throughout
the region, 'there is no reason why we should not capture around 2 per cent
of our sectors of the European truck market'. That would require extra
production of around 1,500 trucks a year.
The next countries in line are Portugal and the Benelux states.
ERF exports 15-20 per cent of its production by value. It has an assembly
plant in South Africa where the truck market is already benefiting from the
post-apartheid 'peace dividend'.
Despite an active leisure life which includes competing in his Aston Martin
racing car, Mr Foden says he has no intention of stepping back from the
chairman and chief executive's role in the foreseeable future.
'My excitement and satisfaction comes from being in the office and running
the business - it's much more fun than sitting on a bench in the sun all
day.'

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (3): Far-reaching global
expansion plan - Profile, Volvo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo, the Swedish car and truck maker, has faced testing times in the past
12 months since the collapse of its planned merger with Renault of France.
The group, the world's second largest heavy truck maker (above 15 tonnes
gross vehicle weight) behind Mercedes-Benz, has been developing a much more
aggressive strategy to expand its automotive operations and to divest
non-core operations as it prepares for an independent future.
The 45 per cent cross shareholdings with Renault Vehicules Industriels have
been dissolved, and Volvo has been working on plans to increase its share of
the world truck market alone, rather than in an alliance with the French
truck maker. Renault's 45 per cent holding in Volvo Truck was acquired for
FFr4.5bn late last month.
Volvo is now poised to embark on a far-reaching expansion of its truck
operations in Europe and Asia. The ambitious moves include the development
of a new range of trucks to allow it to enter the European light truck
market for the first time.
As a crucial part of this strategy it is planning:
To expand the capacity of its heavy truck operations in Europe by up to 20
per cent by mid-1996, with the investment of more than SKr1bn (Dollars
140m).
To develop a range of light trucks (7.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) to
allow it to challenge for the first time established rivals such as
Mercedes-Benz, Iveco, MAN, Renault and Daf in this segment of the European
market,
To establish a joint venture in China with the aim of adding a production
centre in Asia to its three existing regional truck manufacturing operations
in Europe and North and South America. It has also launched a feasibility
study into establishing production in India.
Volvo is leading the European truck industry's emergence from recession
helped by several factors including the weakness of the Swedish krona, the
successful launch of a new range of heavy trucks and its large share of
those European truck markets with the strongest growth such as the UK and
Scandinavia.
Production of its Volvo brand trucks, chiefly in Europe and in Brazil - it
currently sells under the WhiteGMC brand in North America - is running at an
annualised rate of 45,000 a year, an increase of more than 60 per cent from
fewer than 28,000 a year in the depth of the recession in mid-1993.
Volvo's share of the west European heavy truck market has jumped to 15.5 per
cent this year from 12.1 per cent in the whole of 1993, and the company's
truck operations are operating at the limit of their capacity in Europe.
It increased its deliveries of trucks by 38 per cent in the first nine
months this year to 49,400, and its order book for heavy and medium-heavy
duty trucks at the end of September was nearly double the level of a year
earlier.
The losses of 1992 and early 1993 have been overcome thanks to a combination
of tough restructuring and cost-cutting and a strong recovery in demand. The
truck division has closed one truck plant and one bus plant, has cut the
workforce by 19 per cent with the reduction of 4,700 jobs and has
concentrated its spare parts operations.
Volvo claims that new product development processes that are being put in
place will cut lead times from the 60 months for previous truck programmes
to an estimated 36 months in future.
In the first 9 months this year operating profits for Volvo Truck surged to
SKr2.697bn from only SKr183m in the corresponding period a year earlier.
Volvo is already investing SKr390m to raise truck capacity from 45,000 a
year to 50,000 (excluding North America) by July next year. The Volvo board
is expected to approve soon the investment of more than SKr1bn to raise
capacity further to between 55,000 and 60,000 a year by mid-1996.
Volvo's plan for entry into the European light truck market will also be
completed in coming months. It is expected to adopt a strategy of purchasing
the main components such as engines, gearboxes and axles from outside
suppliers, and negotiations on supply contracts are likely to begin in early
1995. Annual production capacity is expected to total well in excess of
10,000 a year.
According to Karl-Erling Trogen, president of Volvo Truck, Asia is Volvo's
'number one priority' in the geographic expansion of its truck operations.
It has launched a feasibility study with China National Heavy Truck and
Shandong Automotive for the establishment of joint ventures for the
production of trucks and components in Shandong province south-east of
Beijing.
Mr Trogen says that Volvo is waiting for approval from Beijing. Production
could rise to around 20,000 a year over six to seven years and Volvo is
'looking at the investment of billions of kronor'.
The group is also establishing a greater presence in east Europe with the
establishment of a small volume truck assembly plant in Poland. The
facility, which will be located in Wroclaw, will have a capacity to assemble
up to 1,000 heavy and medium-duty trucks a year.
The decision to establish a wholly-owned plant follows the failure of its
collaboration plans with Jelcz, the Polish truck maker, which had begun to
assemble Volvo trucks this year.
The Swedish group is moving equipment, tools and personnel from the Jelcz
facilities to its new plant in Wroclaw, where it is planning to produce more
than 700 trucks in 1995. It is the leading importer of heavy-duty trucks to
Poland and expects to deliver around 550 this year. It has established a new
marketing and finance company during 1994, and has a network of 10 dealers
selling exclusively Volvo vehicles.
Volvo is also seeking to expand its truck activities in North America and is
investing Dollars 200m in the next five years to modernise its US heavy
truck operations. It is building a new cab assembly plant and a high-volume
paint shop close to its existing truck assembly plant at Dublin, Virginia,
with operations due to begin in 1997.
Volvo's US heavy truck operation, Volvo GM Heavy Truck, is owned 87 per cent
by the Swedish group and 13 per cent by General Motors of the US. It has
sold its trucks hitherto under the WhiteGMC brand name, but this is to be
replaced by the Volvo brand name, as new products are introduced.
Production capacity at the Dublin truck assembly plant is to be increased by
20 per cent by the end of 1995 to 72 trucks a day from the present capacity
of 60 a day. The facility is being developed as Volvo GM Heavy Truck's
high-volume production operation in the US.
The cab assembly plant will have an initial capacity to produce 70 cabs a
day, but this will be increased later to 110 a day, and the Dublin facility
will also supply cabs to Volvo GM's other truck assembly plant at Orrville,
Ohio.
The investment in the US production facilities is part of the ambitious
modernisation of Volvo's heavy truck range, which began last year with the
launch of its new FH series of heavy trucks in Europe after a seven-year,
SKr6.5bn development programme.
The group is planning for the first time to integrate its US-built trucks
with its European-built products, and is aiming eventually to achieve as
much as 30-40 per cent commonality of components, excluding the driveline of
engine, gearbox and axles. Mr Trogen says that Volvo also plans to supply
around 25 per cent of its US trucks with its own engines in the next two to
three years compared with a current level of around 15 per cent.
Volvo GM Heavy Truck is in fourth place in the US market with a share of
around 12.3 per cent behind Mercedes-Benz (Freightliner) with 24.2 per cent,
and the US producers Paccar (22.3 per cent) and Navistar (18.9 per cent).

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (2): Industry looks
forward to significant growth - Europe, finally emerging from four years of
recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The west European truck industry is finally emerging from four years of
recession, although the recovery remains hesitant. Demand has picked up
strongly in markets such as those in the UK and Scandinavia, but these
increases have been offset by the continuing weakness of sales in Germany
and Italy.
The pattern of the recovery has led to a wide divergence in the performance
of individual European producers, with some groups such as Mercedes-Benz,
Iveco, and MAN still struggling to emerge from losses in Europe, while
others such as Volvo and Scania, the two Swedish truck makers, are already
experiencing a spectacular jump in profits.
Truck sales in western Europe (above 6 tonnes gross vehicle weight) began to
fall in 1990 from a peak of 296,000 in 1989, and the decline became
precipitous in 1993 with sales falling by 22.8 per cent to only 192,000,
according to the latest report by DRI/McGraw-Hill, the UK-based automotive
analysts.
During 1994, manufacturers have become increasingly confident that the worst
of the recession has been passed, however, and producers are now forecasting
several years of significant growth to the end of the 1990s.
According to the latest DRI World Truck Industry Forecast report truck sales
(above 6 tonnes) are expected to rise by 3.9 per cent this year to 199,000,
and demand is expected to strengthen in 1995 and 1996 with growth of around
10 per cent in both years. 'Most national markets have joined the recovery
process in Europe after the worst downturn on record,' says the DRI report.
Western European truck sales are forecast to rise further in the second half
of the 1990s to reach 272,000 by 1999, although this will still be below the
1989 peak.
The recovery has been led by the UK, which was also one of the first markets
to fall into recession. In 1992, UK truck sales fell to 31,398, the lowest
level since the mid-1950s, from a peak of 69,234 in 1989.
In the first 11 months this year UK truck sales (above 3.5 tonnes) have
jumped by 23 per cent, following an increase of 15.8 per cent in 1993, and
the industry is confident that this improvement will be sustained next year.
The sharpest contrast with the UK is provided by Germany, where sales
accelerated to a peak in 1991 in the wake of reunification - offsetting the
early onset of recession in markets such as the UK and France - only to
decline abruptly in the past three years.
DRI forecasts that the 'turning point could soon be reached' in Germany,
too, however. The decline in truck sales eased further in the third quarter
of 1994 with a year-on-year fall of 6 per cent, leaving sales in the first
nine months 10.1 per cent lower than in the corresponding period a year ago.
By contrast with the hesitant recovery in overall sales across western
Europe, truck production has recovered strongly with DRI forecasting a rise
of 18.1 per cent to 251,000 following the drop of 27.2 per cent last year.
Output was depressed last year by low demand and by excess stocks. By 1994,
the heavy constraint of surplus stocks had been removed, however, and truck
makers have also been gearing up to meet stronger levels of demand not only
in Europe but also in overseas markets, in particular in Latin America and
Asia.
Against this background the two Swedish truck makers, Volvo and Scania, have
benefited most with their competitiveness enhanced by the weakness of the
Swedish currency, as well as by the tough restructuring measures taken
during the recession.
Scania, the specialist heavy truck maker (16 tonnes and above), increased
its truck and bus sales worldwide in the first nine months by 28 per cent to
23,500 from 18,400 in the corresponding period a year earlier. The volume of
its order bookings rose by 61 per cent during the first nine months to
29,100 trucks and buses from 18,100, while operating income recovered to
SKr2.448bn from only SKr311m a year earlier.
A similar transformation has been achieved by Volvo Truck, where operating
profits in the first nine months surged to SKr2.697bn from only SKr183m a
year earlier.
Daf, the Dutch truck maker, which collapsed into receivership in early 1993
as the most notable victim of the recession, is also regaining some lost
ground, after its heavy truck operations in Holland and Belgium were rescued
by the Dutch and Flemish governments. In the first six months of this year
it achieved a net profit of Fl39.2m.
Since the rescue in March 1993 it has been able to increase its workforce
from 3,500 to 4,200 with production at its Eindhoven plant up by more than
half compared with 1993. It has recently taken on about 200 temporary
production staff at sites in the Netherlands and Belgium in response to
rising demand.
With the continuing weakness of the German market, Mercedes-Benz and MAN
Nutzfahrzeuge, the leading German truckmakers, have taken longer to emerge
from recession.
Mercedes-Benz's commercial vehicle operations are expected to suffer an
operating loss for a second year in succession in 1994, according to Bernd
Gottschalk, managing director of the group's commercial vehicle division.
However, he forecasts a return to profit in 1995.
MAN suffered a pre-tax loss of DM80m in its latest financial year to the end
of June, but the company is also forecasting a return to profit in the
current year. Its profitability has declined sharply during the past three
years with the 1993/94 loss following pre-tax profits of DM61m in 1992/93
and DM506m in 1991/92.
The company has restructured under the pressure of recession, and Rudolf
Rupprecht, chief executive, says the group has again been operating
profitably in recent months. It forecasts vehicle deliveries in the current
financial year will rise to 37,000-38,000 from 33,000 last year.
Despite the start of recovery this year Helmut Werner, Mercedes-Benz chief
executive, warned recently that the European truck industry was still facing
'enormous excess production capacity', which was likely to grow further due
to productivity increases. Current output of trucks (above 6 tonnes) was
using less than 60 per cent of the available capacity in the industry, he
said.
'The consequences are highly aggressive competition and a battle over prices
and conditions which continues to cause serious problems,' he said.
Part of Mercedes-Benz's response to this pressure is a plan to reduce
radically the share of in-house production in its commercial vehicle
operations, which is to be cut from 42 to 36 per cent.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (4): Putting on a brave
face - Profile, Renault Vehicules Industriels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jilted at the altar at the end of last year, Renault VI, the trucks and
buses arm of the French state-owned motor group, is putting a brave face on
life after its failed merger with Volvo. 'We lost a big opportunity, but we
remain very confident,' says a spokesman for the company.
Optimism is made easier by the rebound in the European truck market which is
pulling out of the severe recession of 1992 and 1993. But revival in the
market, which still remains well below its peaks of the late 1980s, may
mask, rather than resolve, the longer-term strategic challenges facing the
French group.
In the short term, the target is a return to profitability. After suffering
losses of FFr1.4bn in 1993, the company aims to report an operating profit
for 1994 and to move back into the black at the net level next year. The
revival is based on three factors, stronger sales in Europe, particularly in
France, continued strength in the US market where Renault VI is present
through its Mack subsidiary, and further cost-cutting and productivity
measures.
In France, the company expects sales of about 34,000 vehicles this year,
compared with 28,000 in 1993 and an average of about 40,000 over the past 20
years. For Europe as a whole, sales of trucks above five tonnes are expected
to reach 210,000 this year, compared with 203,000 in 1993. The upturn is
confirmed in the company's order books which saw a rise of more than 30 per
cent for Europe in the first nine months of the year.
Maintaining market share has, however, proved a struggle. In France for
example, Renault VI's share slipped slightly to about 42 per cent for the
January-September period, partly because of the price advantage gained by
its Swedish rivals as a result of devaluation last year.
In the US, Mack has steadily strengthened its performance. Acquired in 1990,
the company returned to profitability in February and is benefiting from a
vibrant market. Total sales in the US of Class 8 trucks, which are more than
15 tonnes and comprise Mack's principal products, should reach a record
level of 220,000 this year.
The turnaround at Mack is not just the result of a buoyant market. It also
reflects the benefits of restructuring measures which have seen the
workforce fall from 26,000 in 1987 to below 6,000 today. Similarly, the
number of employees in the company's European operations has been reduced
from about 35,000 to 20,000.
The cost-cutting and efficiency gains are aimed at enabling the company to
remain in profit through the next industry downturn. It is a tall order,
which requires further progress towards economies of scale in manufacturing
and the reduction of development cost.
Renault VI sees the solution in terms of an expansion of specific alliances,
rather than a grand merger a la Volvo. 'A big marriage would be very
difficult,' says a spokesman for the company, citing the lack of appropriate
partners. Iveco, for example, the trucks division of Fiat, is seen as too
similar. Both companies have a strong presence in southern European markets
and a virtually identical model range.
Some steps towards more modest partnerships have already been taken. In
July, Renault concluded an agreement with Iveco, under which the two
companies will co-operate in the manufacture and development of cabins. For
Renault VI the deal concerns its 3.5-tonne and 6-tonne Messenger vehicles.
With Volvo, a joint project to develop rear axles has survived the divorce.
Renault VI also sees scope for production economies within the group. In
particular, there are plans to develop co-operation with Mack in the
development of motors and, possibly, suspension and brake systems.
Are such measures enough? For Renault VI, the response is positive. 'We have
no handicap linked to our size,' says Shemaya Levy, who took over as
chairman at the beginning of the year.
Officials at the company point to the progress made in improving
profitability and the benefits of having a strong US presence. 'The US
market has now moved largely out of phase with the European market,' says a
company official. 'So there is a compensating, anti-cyclical effect which
smoothes earnings.'
As for the prospect that Renault VI could be spun off from the parent
company or that Mack could be sold, the answer is clearly negative. 'Mr
Schweitzer has emphasised that Renault VI is a core element of the group's
business,' the company says. 'Mack is an important element of our strategy.'
Some industry observers, however, remain guarded about the company's
post-Volvo prospects. 'It is still an open question whether Renault is big
enough to survive long term without some substantial partners,' says a motor
industry analyst at one Paris merchant bank. 'Volvo was the ideal solution,
in terms of product range and geographical spread and Renault will find it
that much harder to find the financial resources to revamp its model range
on its own.'

Nomura Securities, the Japanese investment house, has given a big boost to
foreign investor sentiment towards Slovakia with the purchase of a 29 per
cent stake in VUB Kupon, the country's biggest investment fund. Nomura payed
SKK2.18bn (Dollars 68m) for the stake in September, in one of the biggest
foreign investments in the country so far. The transaction was also the
largest ever recorded on the Bratislava stock exchange.
VUB Kupon is managed by VUB Invest, the fund management subsidiary of
Vseobecna Uverova Banka, Slovakia's largest commercial bank. It owns large
blocks of shares in many of the big companies in Slovakia and the Czech
Republic, and is currently heavily weighted towards the latter, with roughly
75 per cent of its portfolio currently represented by Czech assets, says Mr
Ladislav Vaskovic, managing director of VUB Invest.
Slovak fund managers are currently establishing new investment funds to
attract some of the 3.2m investors who have bought vouchers to participate
in the privatisation programme drafted by the outgoing government of prime
minister Mr Jozef Moravcik. Barring undue political delays, the final size
of the voucher programme is likely to be SKK60bn, and competition for the
investment points attached to vouchers is fierce.
Each voucher booklet, which can be bought for SKK1,000, is worth 1,000
investment points. Shares are allocated on the basis of demand.
Shares in companies considered attractive by investors will cost more points
than those of unattractive companies.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of Slovakia (6): Call of the Tatras - Anthony
Robinson takes the mountain tourist trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON

<TEXT>
When Czechoslovakia divorced into its constituent Czech and Slovak parts the
Czechs ended up with two thirds of the population and most of the viable
economic assets. But Slovakia ended up with the most beautiful parts of the
former federal state which in inter-war times extended even further east
into Trans-Carpathian Ruthenia.
Slovakia's jewel, and the focal point of its tourist industry, is the High
Tatra mountains, which separates Slovakia from Poland. Its snow-covered
central massif is less than 50km. long.
Immediately after the 'velvet divorce' the High Tatras lost their habitual
aficionados, mainly Czechs and Germans. But this year tourism in general,
but especially in the High Tatras, is showing a marked recovery.
Last year, (according to official statistics which understate the
contribution from the private sector) tourism earned only Dollars 314m from
16.3m visitors, This year, 14.4m visitors entered the country in the first
nine months alone and earnings for the first six months reached Dollars
268m. In the summer, Bratislava, the capital, received a steady flow of
weekend tourists from Austria and other countries, while hotels and guest
houses in the High Tatras report full bookings for Christmas and the New
Year.
The communist regime constructed a superhighway along the base of the
Tatras, which is fine for tour coaches but bad news for walkers. The old
regime also put up ugly concrete blocks masquerading as hotels. Fortunately,
however, there are also plenty of survivors from a more civilised age, such
as the splendid Grand Hotel at Stary Smokovec, and smaller, cheaper
establishments typified by the chalet-like Hotel Panda, also at Smokovec,
which provides a warm welcome, goose for dinner and simple comfortable rooms
for Dollars 25 a night all found.
Meanwhile, walkers and wanderers can ignore the super highway by opting for
the red trams which wind their way around the contours of the mountain and
through the pine forests.
But there is more to Slovakia than the High Tatras. Bratislava, or rather
its historic centre, is small and provincial compared with the glories of
Prague. It was further spoiled by the communists who demolished a medieval
synagogue and a network of cobbled streets and old town houses to build the
bridge which connects the old town with the high rise 1970s suburb of
prefabricated 'panelak' housing called Petrzalka across the fast-flowing
Danube.
Under the Habsburgs, when it was still called Pressburg, Bratislava was a
favourite place for weekend outings by the people of Vienna upstream. Under
its honest and capable mayor, Mr Peter Kresanek, it is now looking up again.
The mayor, a Christian democrat, was re-elected with a comfortable majority
at last month's local elections.
Privatisation, and the restitution of property to former owners, has led to
a reconstruction and re-furbishing boom which has restored the elegance of
medieval, gothic and baroque churches, public buildings and the cheap and
excellent opera and national theatres. Formerly neglected streets have been
transformed and new private shops, cafes and restaurants have created a new
vitality.
A small private hotel, the Perugia, has opened near the main square and the
post-war Devin Hotel remains friendly, good value and full of central
European atmosphere. The same cannot be said for its brash neighbour on the
river front, the French-owned Danube, which charges high prices for spartan
rooms, shoddy decor and the same terrible telephones as cheaper
establishments. The Forum Intercontinental remains the smartest hotel in
town, but it too is expensive, heavy on the marble and light on charm.
Between Bratislava, at the south western tip of the country, and Kosice,
500km. east of the capital and 100km. from the Ukrainian border, lies a
string of small towns and industrial villages along the Vah valley. An
alternative route takes one through the folds of the low Tatra mountains,
actually a succession of wooded hills and occasional rocky outcrops, often
crowned with spectacular ruined castles.
Before the war the towns and villages must have been harmonious little
jewels. Their centres usually still are. But all too frequently the
communists surrounded the historic centres with uniformly ugly glass and
cement housing estates in defiance of all the rules of aesthetics or the
logic of natural contours.
Visitors to Kosice, the capital of eastern Slovakia, are often depressed by
the endless industrialised suburbs on the outskirts, only to be delighted by
the glorious gothic pile of St Elisabeth's cathedral, the restored 19th
century theatre and the strongly Hungarian-influenced architectural style of
the old city.
Kosice's churches, with services in Slovak and Hungarian, synagogues and
fine houses reflect the past ethnic complexity and cultural vitality of a
city striving to revive its past glories. One of the three synagogues is
still functioning, although plaques on the two largest recall how thousands
of Jews were rounded up and sent to their deaths when Kosice was returned to
Hungary by Hitler and the rest of Slovakia was ruled as a Nazi puppet state
headed by a renegade Catholic priest, Father Jozef Tiso.
Scattered throughout Slovakia are remnants of earlier settlements of
Swabians, Hungarians, Ukrainians, Jews, Ruthenians, Gypsies and others.
Beyond Kosice lies Ruthenia, although most of Trans-Carpathian Ruthenia was
annexed by Stalin after the war and now lies in Ukraine.
In general, the further east one goes the poorer the people, but the more
intact are the old villages and towns, like Bardejov, and many other
reminders of a rural past which was shaken up but not entirely destroyed
during the communist years.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of Slovakia (4): Never mind the politics - A second
round of privatisation is about to start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Differences over the policy and implementation of privatisation have been a
battleground between Mr Vladimir Meciar and his political opponents
throughout the brief life of the Slovak republic.
Whatever their political allegiances, however, more than 3.2m Slovaks,
roughly 60 per cent of the population, have shown their hand by buying the
books of coupons which they can exchange for shares in state companies.
Popular support for private ownership did not translate into political
support for the outgoing government as happened in the Czech republic two
years ago. But the voucher method chosen for Slovakia's second round of mass
privatisation is based on that pioneered by the former Czechoslovakia and
put into operation in both halves of the then federal state.
Though the outgoing government's original plan to privatise up to SKK80bn
worth of state companies through vouchers is likely to be diluted by the new
administration, investment fund managers remain confident that it will give
a substantial boost to the country's capital markets and further increase
the role of the private sector in the Slovak economy.
Ladislav Vaskovic, chairman of VUB Invest which manages Slovakia's biggest
investment fund, VUB Kupon, describes the response to the voucher
privatisation programme as 'the biggest mandate of all'. It is a clear sign
that Slovaks are in favour of voucher privatisation, he says, and should
send a message to the incoming administration of Vladimir Meciar not to
tamper with it, as he has threatened.
If even a watered-down version of voucher privatisation is completed it will
give a substantial boost to Slovakia's capital markets. Investment fund
managers say the final size of the voucher privatisation programme should be
SKK60bn.
This is lower than the Moravcik government's target because the original
proposals included the profitable gas transmission and electricity
generation and transmission companies. Now, Sergei Kozlik, Mr Meciar's chief
economic adviser, says the energy sector has been designated a 'strategic
industry' in which the state will retain a majority shareholding.
There are already more than 500 companies quoted on the Bratislava stock
exchange as a result of the first wave of voucher privatisation which took
place when Slovakia was part of federal Czechoslovakia. Only 13 companies
are fully listed, but they include such key companies as Biotika, a
pharmaceutical group, Slovnaft, the refining and petrochemical giant, Nafta,
a gas supplier, and Vseobecna Uverova Banka (the General Credit Bank),
Slovakia's dominant commercial bank.
Stockbrokers say the bulk of trading activity is concentrated on about 50
stocks, which are liquid enough to allow for a true market in their shares.
Over 90 per cent of all trading is done outside the three official trading
systems, the stock exchange, the options exchange, and the RM-S, a computer
trading system that depends for its viability on dispersed shareholdings
resulting from voucher privatisation.
Trading is dominated by the big investment fund managers, which include
Harvard Capital and Consulting, CassoviaInvest and Creditanstalt as well as
VUB.
Share prices are currently in the doldrums, with the SAX index of
most-traded shares hovering around the 200 points level, compared to its
peak of 401 points last March. That rally was driven mainly by foreign
investment at a time when the Prague stock market was also booming, but a
subsequent pull-out by overseas investors caused both markets to collapse.
The Bratislava market's biggest problem is its chronic lack of liquidity.
Ironically, one of the causes of illiquidity is voucher privatisation, which
leaves investment funds with large portfolios of shares and little or no
cash.
Fund managers lament the lack of fixed interest stocks in the market, with
just four large bond issues quoted so far.
In common with other emerging markets, Slovakia's capital markets are also
beset with problems of transparency and lack of regulation. The outgoing
government has almost completed a major plan to supervise the banking and
financial sector, and there is a proposal to establish a regulatory body
along the lines of the US Securities and Exchange Commission to set rules
and ensure they are implemented.
Brigita Schmognerova, outgoing deputy prime minister in charge of the
economy, says the new body will be charged with supervising the banking,
pension fund and investment fund industries as well as the stock exchange.
The authorities' main aim is to prevent a banking collapse on the scale of
that of Banka Bohemia, a Czech bank that was shut down earlier this year
after it issued Dollars 1bn worth of fake securities abroad.
'We have not had any big problems so far but it is only a matter of time,'
Ms Schmognerova says. 'I hope the new government understands the necessity
of building such an institution.'
The outgoing government's plan also calls for the concentration of share
trading in a single market. Bratislava's three stock markets are an
expensive anachronism in such an underdeveloped market, and a fierce battle
for survival is currently being waged between the stock exchange, which is
owned by Slovakia's major banks, and the options exchange, which functions
as a spot market. Thomas Grey, principal investment officer at Slovak
International, an investment advisory group, says the stock market is 50
years behind the times.
Volume on the official markets rarely exceeds Dollars 150,000 daily, which
is less than 10 per cent of total trading. The rest is done directly among
brokers and market makers who bypass official channels because it is cheaper
and faster. Brokers favour the options exchange, where a one-day forward
contract helps set price levels in the over-the-counter market.
Juraj Siroky, president of Harvard Capital and Consulting (closely related
to the company of the same name in Prague), says the options exchange is
more tuned in to market trends and could already be the main trading
mechanism if it had not been refused a stock market licence by the finance
ministry. But the latter currently favours the existing stock exchange as
the centre of future trading.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (1): Worst is over for
the global truck makers - After four years of recession, demand for
commercial vehicles is beginning to rise in Europe and Japan. Kevin Done
examines prospects for the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE

<TEXT>
The world truck industry is no place for the faint-hearted, as markets
plunge through exaggerated cycles of feast and famine.
Four years of recession in western Europe had pushed most of the region's
truck makers into loss by last year with one leading producer collapsing
into receivership. Now the European industry's fortunes are again on the
mend, but already truck makers at the forefront of the recovery are
straining against the limits of their production capacity, as demand rises
more steeply than expected in markets such as the UK and Scandinavia.
In North America, heavy truck makers lost more than a third of their market
between 1988 and 1991. In the past three years sales have surged back,
however, with demand almost doubling from 108,000 in 1991 to a forecast
level of more than 206,000 this year. Leading US producers such as Paccar
are achieving record profits.
In Japan, truck registrations fell for five years in succession from 1989 to
1993, but here, too, the worst of the recession appears to have passed.
Japanese domestic truck sales, exports and production have all begun to
recover in recent months.
Surviving such sharp fluctuations in demand exerts heavy pressures on the
truck makers, and their ranks have been thinned as each recession takes its
toll. In western Europe there were still 52 truck makers in operation in
1975. By 1984, the total had been reduced to 14 and by this year the number
had fallen to 11.
The outcome of the latest bout of restructuring in Europe remains unclear,
however. Daf, the Dutch commercial vehicle maker which took over Leyland,
the loss-making UK truck producer, in the second half of the 1980s, became
the most notable victim of the latest recession, when it collapsed into
receivership in early 1993.
The former Daf group's Dutch and Belgian heavy truck operations have been
re-established, however, thanks to a state-backed rescue package, and other
parts of the group in the UK have also emerged from receivership as
independent companies, albeit after severe restructuring.
The biggest change to the industry - in Europe and in the US - was heralded
by the planned merger of Volvo, already the world's second largest heavy
truck maker, with Renault, the French state-controlled automotive group.
Together they would have controlled around 26 per cent of the European heavy
truck market and 23 per cent of the US market through their respective
subsidiaries Volvo GM Heavy Truck and Mack.
The merger foundered, however, in the face of a revolt by Volvo shareholders
and senior management, which had fundamental concerns about the valuation of
the Swedish group and the holding of a 'golden share' by the French state.
The two companies have dissolved the 3 1/2 -year-old alliance and last month
completed the break-up of the 45 per cent cross shareholdings in their
respective truck and bus operations.
Both groups have been forced to develop alternative strategies to replace
the alliance, although Karl-Erling Trogen, president of Volvo Truck, insists
that 'the industrial idea behind the merger is still valid. I foresee the
need for different kinds of partnerships in the future to get economies of
scale in industrial production,' he says. 'The business approach has not
changed.'
The leading European truck makers dominate the world heavy truck market.
Mercedes-Benz of Germany, the world's largest truck and bus maker, and Volvo
both have substantial operations and market shares in Europe and in north
and south America, while Scania of Sweden is the market leader in Brazil as
well as the most profitable of the truck makers in Europe.
The European producers are now seeking to broaden their operations by
establishing a stronger presence in Asia, where the industry is still
dominated by the leading Japanese truck makers, Hino, Isuzu, Nissan Diesel
and Mitsubishi Motor.
Volvo is seeking to establish a joint venture in China with the aim of
adding a production centre in Asia to its three existing regional truck
manufacturing operations in Europe and north and south America. It has also
launched a feasibility study into establishing production in India.
According to Mr Trogen, Asia is Volvo's 'number one priority' for the
geographic expansion of its truck operations. It has entered a feasibility
study with China National Heavy Truck and Shandong Automotive for the
establishment of joint ventures for the production of both trucks and
components in Shandong province south-east of Beijing and is now awaiting
official approval for the project from the Chinese authorities.
Mercedes-Benz is negotiating two ambitious joint ventures in China for the
production of heavy trucks, and buses and coaches. It is conducting a
feasibility study with Yangzhou Motor Coach Manufacturing (YMC), the biggest
Chinese bus and coach producer, for the formation of a joint venture with
the target of producing up to 12,000 bus chassis and 6,000 large coaches a
year.
Global expansion is also causing other changes in strategic approach.
This year Mercedes-Benz started production in Indonesia of a new range of
light-duty trucks and buses. The project marks a drastic change in the
German group's approach to developing new vehicles for the global commercial
vehicle market, as it seeks to overcome the disadvantage of its high
domestic cost base.
The MB 700 range of light-duty trucks (7.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) has
been developed to meet Asian cost levels using a system of global sourcing
of components.
Engines for the vehicles will be assembled in Indonesia from components
produced by Mercedes-Benz's commercial vehicle subsidiary in Brazil.
Transmissions and front axles are to be supplied by Tata Engineering and
Locomotive (Telco) in India, while the rear axles will also come from India
from AAL, a licensee of Rockwell, the US automotive components supplier.
Brakes and shock absorbers will be supplied from India, propeller shafts
will be made by Spicer in the US, Mercedes-Benz Argentina will supply the
mechanical steering system, optional power steering will come from Koyo in
Japan, while cab parts will be supplied by Mercedes-Benz's Spanish
subsidiary.
'The supply of major components from a country with high wage levels like
Germany could not satisfy the cost target. New ways had to be found,' says
Klaus-Dieter Vohringer, Mercedes-Benz components production director.
'Commercial vehicle concepts in the Far East and Europe differ considerably,
not only in dimensions but more so in the cost structure. The market
requirements in Europe cause a cost situation that is unacceptable to
customers in south-east Asia.'
Such global initiatives promise gradually to remove the existing marked
regional distinctions in the world truck industry, which have tended
hitherto to limit the amount of global competition between regional product
concepts.
European and Japanese truck makers generally develop and produce their own
principal driveline components - engines, gearboxes and axles. In North
America, by contrast, the truck makers concentrate chiefly on assembly,
while engines, gearboxes and axles are bought in from component makers.
At the same time Japanese and Asian truck development has been influenced by
the geography and infrastructure of Japan. Shorter distances, lower average
speeds and lower gross vehicle weights mean that trucks are generally
smaller in Japan.
Such regional differences have so far prevented Japanese producers from
competing significantly in the European and North American heavy truck and
bus markets, and the US overseas presence is also limited.
The leading European producers have made the strongest efforts at overcoming
such regional hurdles, and Asia is the new target for global expansion.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of Slovakia (1): Lively two year-old at the
crossroads - Industry and the economy are advancing steadily. But Slovak
politics are increasingly polarised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After two years of independence the basic institutions of the new Slovak
state are in place and the economy is responding well to tough, IMF-imposed
monetary and fiscal policies. Rising exports are stimulating a recovery of
industrial growth and boosting reserves.
But this central European country of 5.3m people remains politically
polarised between a coalition of populist and nationalist forces, led by Mr
Vladimir Meciar, and a fragmented opposition of Christian democrats,
socialists and liberals.
Slovakia's aims remain the creation of a prosperous democracy and eventual
membership of an enlarged European Union alongside the other former
communist states of central Europe. But fulfilment of these aims remains
fraught with considerable uncertainty.
General elections over the last weekend of September re-affirmed Mr Meciar
and his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) as the dominant force in
Slovak politics. He won the assent of 35 per cent of voters, more than his
party's three main rivals combined. The result was a personal triumph for
this charismatic but unforgiving man, and a traumatic defeat for both
President Michal Kovac and Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik. Both are former
allies of Mr Meciar who defected from the HZDS and helped to orchestrate the
parliamentary revolt that toppled him and his government in March.
The new government put together by Mr Moravcik in the spring was a
broad-based 'historic compromise' of socialists, Christian democrats and
liberal democrats. It held together well, presented a sober, democratic
image to the outside world and restarted mass privatisation and other
stalled economic reforms. But hopes that the coalition parties would gain
electoral advantage from their good governance were dashed by the
electorate.
The Party of the Democratic Left (SLD), led by an intelligent and articulate
band of young former communists under Mr Peter Weiss, hoped to emerge as the
biggest single party from elections. Instead it suffered a haemorrhage of
support from frustrated workers and the unemployed and won only 10.4 per
cent of the vote.
The Christian democrats (KDH), led by Mr Jan Carnogursky, received 10.2 per
cent while the Democratic Union (DU), a collection of liberal democrats and
former HZDS dissidents led by Mr Moravcik, picked up 8.6 per cent. In total,
the coalition parties received 29.2 per cent of the votes and 50 seats in
the 150 seat parliament against the 35 per cent of votes and 61 seats gained
by the HZDS.
Mr Meciar's victory left him far short of the simple majority needed to
govern, and even further from the qualified majority of 90 seats needed to
satisfy his main ambition of changing the constitution of the state which he
did so much to bring into existence. His long term aim is to transform
Slovakia from a parliamentary into a presidential democracy, with himself as
president. It is a prospect which fills many Slovaks with alarm.
Mr Meciar's appeal, while not inconsiderable, is concentrated geographically
in the economically depressed hinterland of the Vah valley and central
Slovakia. Sociologically he is popular among the weaker, less educated
elements in Bratislava and Kosice, which have a tradition of ethnic
tolerance and intellectual independence. He, and his xenophobic nationalist
allies, the Slovak National Party, (SNS), are implacably opposed by the 10
per cent ethnic Hungarian minority whose votes up to now have been frozen in
the political ghetto of ethnic-Hungarian parties.
In the short term, Mr Meciar faces the task of forming a credible and
efficient government with his nationalist allies from the SNS and his
'workerist' partners from the new Workers Union. The latter won more than 7
per cent of the vote by articulating the demands of the low paid and
unemployed for more money and more jobs. These demands will be difficult to
reconcile with the IMF's prescription of balanced budgets and fiscal
restraint.
Longer term, the task facing the opposition is to forge a more united and
credible centre party out of the social democratic, liberal and Christian
democratic strands of Slovak political life, and to keep Mr Meciar within
the bounds of political behaviour that are required if Slovakia is
eventually to enter the EU alongside the Czech Republic.
Meanwhile, behind the Sturm und Drang of Slovak politics, a substantial
improvement is taking place in the macro-economic performance of the Slovak
economy, with substantial agreement between the main parties on the need to
continue taking the bitter medicine prescribed by the IMF.
The underlying structural weaknesses of the Slovak economy were revealed by
the loss of an estimated Dollars 700m a year subsidy from Prague on
independence in January 1993, and above all by the collapse of Comecon
markets and the end of the Cold War.
Attempts to restructure the big military factories concentrated in the Vah
valley and central Slovakia have had very limited results. New investment
and joint ventures with foreign companies to shift from producing tanks to
tractors, fork-lift trucks and construction machinery were all predicated on
a post-communist reconstruction boom in the former Soviet states which, thus
far, has failed to materialise. Unemployment in these areas remains very
high, between 25-40 per cent in some districts compared with the national
average of 14 per cent.
On the other hand, the private sector now accounts for more than 40 per cent
of GDP and is growing steadily. A revived mass privatisation programme seems
destined to survive the change of government, albeit with relatively minor
modifications.
Several of the biggest former state owned industries such as Slovnaft, the
refining and petrochemical complex, and VSZ, the biggest integrated steel
group, have been partly privatised and re-organised with substantial new
investment. Long-stalled projects, like the Slovalco aluminium smelter in
central Slovakia, are being revived with support from the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
The main need now is for an acceleration of institutional reforms of the
banking and finance sector and better management and new investment in the
enterprise and farming sectors. Meanwhile, strong demand for steel,
petrochemicals and other Slovak products in world markets has contributed to
an export boom which is raising industrial output and pouring hard currency
into the reserves which have more than quadrupled over the last 18 months to
around Dollars 3.4bn.
Tight central bank control of monetary policy and public spending cuts have
brought prices down to within sight of single digit inflation next year.
Lower inflation and rising reserves have reinforced the Slovak koruna, which
was devalued by 10 per cent in July 1993 in agreement with the IMF. Since
then the exchange rate has been stable.
Inflows of foreign investment, however, are just a trickle compared with
levels in the Czech Republic, Hungary or Poland. This is a direct result of
political instability. Slovakia needs to maintain its access to the
international capital markets to get financing for the massive job of
restructuring industry and developing the infrastructure.
The 3.2m people who have invested in the voucher privatisation programme
have effectively passed a vote of confidence in continued economic reform.
Mr Meciar is far too astute to miss that message, and it may yet have a
large bearing on his policies in government.
'Heed what he does, not what he says,' say some observers in Bratislava of
Mr Meciar, arguing that he is a different, more pragmatic animal in
government than his rhetoric at the hustings makes him appear. Many Slovaks
as well as potential foreign investors and political partners will be doing
just that.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of Slovakia (3): Frustration of a nation builder -
Interview, Mr Michal Kovac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When independent Slovakia was born in January last year Mr Michal Kovac
hoped to use the authority of his office as the country's first president to
build a new sense of statehood. But the political instability that gripped
the country almost from the start has left him little time for
nation-building.
'So far I have not succeeded,' he notes with a shrug, sitting on the edge of
a chair in his sparsely furnished office in the baroque former Bishop's
Palace where Napoleon and the Austrian Emperor signed a temporary peace
after the French triumph at the battle of Austerlitz.
The man who has been making life hard for Mr Kovac is his former colleague
and fellow-communist, Vladimir Meciar, who is about to return as prime
minister after being forced from office last March, with the president a key
player in his ousting.
Mr Kovac appears unfazed at the prospect of his arch-enemy returning at the
head of a new government, which is likely to be strongly populist,
nationalist, anti-Hungarian and anti-Michal Kovac in tone. Indeed, the
president is a little richer because of the result of the election at the
end of September.
He was the winner of a presidential office bet on the outcome, winning the
princely sum of SKK1,000 (Dollars 32) by predicting most closely the share
of the vote going to Mr Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) -
it won 35 per cent; Mr Kovac predicted 33 per cent.
Observers in Bratislava say Mr Kovac has learned quickly how to get his
opinion across within the constraints imposed by his position. Every
political party, he says, has the same value for him, and he can express
neither anxiety nor joy at a certain party's success or failure. Election
results, he says, express the democratic wish of the people, and 'I'm
obliged to respect that'.
But the the president now suspects that he and the office he holds are due
for renewed attack. Mr Meciar wants to establish a presidential form of
government in Slovakia, a move Mr Kovac thinks is dangerous. The roots of
democracy are not yet deep enough in Slovakia for such a system, he says,
warning of a subsequent misuse of personal power. 'I'm for a parliamentary
system, not a presidential one.'
In order to establish a presidential system Mr Meciar needs to muster 90
votes in the 150-member parliament to secure a change to the constitution.
As talks on forming a new government drag on without any immediate sign of
success the likelihood that the new prime minister will achieve his goal
recedes, though he has still not committed himself to ceasing his attacks on
Mr Kovac.
The president says that if a presidential system is established its success
will depend entirely on the personality of the holder. Does he think Mr
Meciar is a suitable candidate for such a position? 'I am not able to say,'
he comments diplomatically.
Would he be a candidate himself? 'I haven't decided yet.' Observers in
Bratislava say he almost certainly would run for office in such an event.
He would not object to a presidential system, he says, if the new
constitution that would result allowed for unfettered opposition politics
and independent radio and television and 'if other democratic functions were
allowed to function'.
But even without being president or even prime minister Mr Meciar has
already used the power stemming from a bare coalition majority to wrest
control of the media and other key state bodies such as the National
Property Fund, which prepares companies for privatisation.
Early in November, in a parliamentary session that has become known as
'Bloody Thursday', he organised a parliamentary coup which gives his
incoming government complete control of these bodies and gave an early
warning of the confrontational tone of his administration.
Though he appears remarkably self-confident for a man who has been publicly
vilified by his enemies for his role in removing Mr Meciar in the national
interest earlier this year, Mr Kovac is clearly disappointed that he has
been prevented from developing his original vision of a unifying presidency.
Mr Kovac was not widely known when he assumed office at the beginning of
last year. The man destined to become Slovakia's first president had been
Alexander Dubcek, the communist party leader whose Prague Spring reforms led
to the Warsaw Pact invasion in 1968. But he was killed in a car accident
just weeks before his country became independent on December 31, 1992.
Mr Kovac stepped into his shoes. But, both as a communist party official and
as chairman of the last Czechoslovak federal parliament after the velvet
revolution, he has spent a great deal of time in Prague, a suspicious past
for the more nationalistic of Slovak voters.
Asked whether he thought independence had changed him and his
fellow-Slovaks, Mr Kovac lamented that the old way of thinking, in which the
state promised to take care of everything, still predominated. It even
helped to ensure Mr Meciar's victory in the election. 'People still think
some bright new future will come out of that kind of thinking. But such a
thing does not exist any more,' he says.

FT  16 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Warburg hit as talks fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bull case for SG Warburg sagged yesterday as the merchant bank announced
that its merger talks with Morgan Stanley, of the US, had foundered.
The sticking point in the deal was Mercury Asset Management, Warburg's 75
per cent-owned fund management arm. Morgan Stanley said Mercury shareholders
demanded too high a price and it was not prepared to take Warburg on its
own.
Many analysts were still looking confidently towards the next stage. They
believe Warburg has put up the 'For Sale' sign and expect other potential
buyers to appear. They added that with a hostile bid out of the question,
contenders will have to pay a premium price to buy off the recalcitrant MAM
shareholders, and Pounds 12 a share was still in sight. Others are more
cynical. One leading analyst said: 'I do not see anyone coming to buy
yesterday's merchant bank.'
The news that the deal was off came when many dealers were at lunch and sent
Warburg's share price spiralling downwards. The sudden shift of the price at
which dealers were prepared to offer stock prompted a sharp backwardation -
a situation where bid and offer prices are technically reversed. The shares
tumbled 80, bounced and then dropped back to close 99 off at 699p with 4.9m
traded. Mercury Asset Management retreated 67 to 678p.
The news took the shine off the other perceived bid targets within the
sector. Smith New Court lost 12 at 415p and Kleinwort Benson shed 22 to
519p.
Profit-taking in bid target Northern Electric gathered pace after the
Department of Trade and Industry emphasised that it would hold on to its
golden shares in UK utilities until March 1995.
Trafalgar House confirmed market speculation on Wednesday that it was
considering a bid for Northern. Analysts were not completely surprised by
the DTI announcement, but one said: 'This is just prolonging the
inevitable.'
Shares in Northern reversed Wednesday's strong rise and slipped 26 to 984p
in busy trade of 2.4m. The company also said it had requested a stock
exchange enquiry into the rise in its shares before Trafalgar stated its
intentions.
The view taken by some analysts is that there is better value elsewhere in
the sector. Mr Kevin Lapwood at Smith New Court was among those that back
such a view and he said: 'On a break-up value we would rate Northern at
1160p. But we value Norweb at 1280p, East Midlands at 1100p and South Wales
at 1250p.'
Norweb also suffered from profit-taking and retreated 9 to 791p, but East
Midlands jumped 29 to 798p and South Wales moved forward 7 1/2 to 834 1/2 p.
Other big moves included Manweb, up 24 at 855p, and Midlands, 32 higher at
836p.
Trafalgar, which advanced 1 1/2 to 73 1/2 p, was boosted by the release of
favourable full-year figures which saw the company turn a Pounds 347m loss
last year into a Pounds 45.6m profit this year. The group also ruled out a
rights issue should it decide to go ahead with a bid for Northern Electric.
Pharmaceuticals stocks received support in the US, with some feeling that
the sector will receive a fundamental rerating next year. There was some
technical London selling ahead of futures expiry in the UK but there was
specific interest in SmithKline Beecham, up a penny at 445p following a well
received presentation earlier in the week, and in Zeneca, perceived as a
possible bid candidate and which rose 6 to 858p. Wellcome, a penny off at
671p, has attracted steady takeover speculation but the shares were
restrained yesterday as the market reacted to a story in the US that was
critical of Aids drug combinations. Wellcome manufactures the leading Aids
treatment AZT, or Retrovir.
Positive clinical trial reports from Scotia Holdings on its cancer treatment
saw the shares forge ahead 21 to 274p.
Asda's strong interims helped to push the shares up  1/2 to 64p, but
turnover was relatively modest at 7m and the rest of the sector was mostly
easier. J. Sainsbury dipped 2 to 388p and Tesco shed 3 to 234p.
The results were comfortably ahead of City expectations and most securities
houses upgraded full-year profits forecasts, although reduced depreciation
accounted for most of the unforeseen gains.
BZW's full-year estimate was moved up by Pounds 15m to Pounds 230m, with the
investment bank taking a shine to like-for-like sales growth of 7 per cent
over the first 28 weeks of 1994-95.
Standard Chartered moved ahead 13 to 275p as various houses stressed their
positive views following news that the bank is to reduce costs through staff
cuts.
Abbey National improved a penny to 407p as James Capel published a buy
recommendation arguing that the former building society would benefit from a
lower cost base and increased market share.
Media conglomerate Pearson dropped 12 to 557p on unwinding of technical long
positions.
Yorkshire Television fell 7 to 373p on turnover of 3m, with investment fund
M&amp;G believed to have contributed heavily to the selling.
Food manufacturers were a mixed bag. Unilever rose 13 to 1123p following a
buy recommendation from NatWest Securities, but Cadbury-Schweppes shed a
further 9 to 395p for a two-day decline of 14 as worries built up over the
possibility of soft drink demand looking sick against warm-weather inflated
1994 volumes.
News that AG Barr, number three in the soft drinks league, had gained the
take-home franchise for Orangina International helped to lift Barr 13 to
383p. Edible oils specialist Acatos &amp; Hutcheson jumped 14 to 264p on the
back of strong prelims and an extra penny on the dividend.
A complex deal involving a steel mill disposal, an effective share buy-back,
a rights issue and a French acquisition led to heavy trading in ASW, which
closed 20 higher at 215p after 1.7m turnover.
Motor components group BSG International also met with big turnover.
Following boardroom moves and a meeting with analysts the shares rose 1 1/2
to 55 1/2 p in 7.1m traded.
Housebuilders managed a modest rebound, with Barratt Developments improving
6 to 151p in 1.6m turnover and Bryant adding 3 1/2 at 122p. The improving
sentiment was helped by a return to profit at YJ Lovell, which bounded ahead
by 12 per cent, adding 7 at 60p.
Among building materials issues, Blue Circle dipped 5 to 265p but Rugby
gained 3 1/2 at 106p. RMC slid 23 to 941p, although in each case trading
volume was nominal.

FT  16 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures moved narrowly in low volume, with trading mostly
underpinned by profit-taking on the back of Wednesday's strong gains, writes
Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract, which expires this morning, stood at 2,974
at the close of pit trading, down four points. The March contract was three
points easier at 2,994.
The December contract was right in line with the cash market, while March
closed at a 19-point premium - broadly in the middle of dealers' range of
fair value premiums.
In contrast to Wednesday when the session was marked by steady buying,
activity was flat, with less than 15,000 contracts traded and substantial
spread trading into the March contract.
Where there was business it was mostly generated by profit-taking, although
expiry influences and year-end book adjustments were clearly also factors at
play. The best of the day for the March contract was 3,019.
Option turnover was also dull, tailing away to 30,666 lots from 43,329 on
Wednesday. Put volume had the edge on calls, while FT-SE and Euro FT-SE
trading accounted for just under 22,000 contracts.
Abbey National was the most active stock option, followed by Scottish Power
and Cadbury-Schweppes. Abbey National saw 2,020 lots transacted.

FT  16 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Impending expiry and bid failure
upset equities - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News that merger discussions between SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley had been
terminated hit the UK equity market like a bombshell and eroded much of the
recent takeover enthusiasm in London.
The news, coupled with determined efforts by some marketmakers to drive the
market down ahead of this morning's expiry of the December Footsie future,
saw an early attempt by the FT-SE 100 Index to break through the 3,000
barrier come to nothing.
At the end of a session fraught with anxiety for some of the speculators
that have piled into the merchant banks and utilities areas, the FT-SE 100
Index settled 7.2 down at 2,973.4, only marginally above the day's low of
2,973.2.
The late slide in the FT-SE 100 also impacted on the market's second-liners,
with the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which posted a 16-point gain in mid-morning,
closing only 8.3 ahead on balance at 3,413.9.
Adding to the speculators' worries was a sharp fall in shares of Northern
Electric. However, many of the other regional electricity stocks continued
to make rapid progress amid a general feeling that a spate of takeover bids
in the sector could materialise in coming months. Water stocks, too, were
viewed as takeover targets.
Market observers were surprised at the late sell-off, pointing out that
European markets had been expected to take heart from another impressive
showing from Wall Street, which shrugged off slightly disappointing news of
the Philadelphia index and powered ahead shortly after the opening when it
was trading around 20 points higher.
Brokers were by no means disheartened by the day's news. 'UK plc is at just
the right stage of the cycle to attract a surge of takeover activity; the
stock market is not overbought, inflation is under control and there are
plenty of cash rich companies looking to expand and pick up good quality
assets. January and February will be good months to be in the stock market,'
was the view of one senior broker.
Earlier, the UK market had performed well, coming within two points of the
3,000 mark on the FT-SE 100, after news that retail sales remained sluggish
in November, news that was seen as consistent with trends revealed in the
last Confederation of British Industry survey of distributive trades.
With the market still bubbling from talk of plenty more takeover bids to
come in the near future, the FT-SE 100 was trading around 13 points up when
details of the aborted merger talks between SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley
filtered into the market.
Dealers said many speculators simply panicked and there was talk of severe
losses among private investors.
Towards the close of business, however, there was keen support for Warburg
shares amid stories of other potential bidders already holding talks with
the UK's premier merchant bank.
But with Morgan Stanley seen as keen to take in a top investment management
group, there were good gains in that area of the market, groups such as
Gartmore, Henderson Administration, Johnson Fry, M &amp; G and Perpetual all
attracting support.
As Warburg tumbled, so did the FT-SE 100. It dipped into the red over the
lunchtime period and continued to slip away for the rest of the session.
Although subdued by the day's events, dealers expressed satisfaction at the
upturn in activity in recent sessions. Turnover fell just short of 700m,
with non-FT-SE 100 stocks accounting for 59 per cent of the total. The value
of customer business this week is well up on recent trading sessions, with
Wednesday's figure reaching Pounds 1.58bn, compared with Tuesday's Pounds
1.6bn and the previous week's best of Pounds 1.34bn.

FT  16 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Rates outlook helps Dow to
build on gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US equities added to Wednesday's gains on speculation that the Federal
Reserve would not raise interest rates next week, writes Lisa Bransten in
New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 19.18 higher at 3,765.47.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 put on 0.37 at 455.34, the
American Stock Exchange composite rose 2.95 to 426.02 and the Nasdaq
composite advanced 5.01 to 730.68. Trading volume on the New York SE
totalled 337m shares.
A survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia showed December
business activity declining to 28.9 per cent. It was the second month that
the index, derived from a survey of businesses, showed a drop in business
activity.
That news, combined with low inflation figures released on Wednesday, was
enough to persuade the market that the Fed would not increase interest rates
again at the December 20 meeting of its open market committee.
In addition to the change in sentiment, share prices were pushed up by
technical trading and program buying in advance of tomorrow's expiration of
options and futures on stock indices in the last hour of trading.
Morgan Stanley retreated Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 61 after the investment
bank announced that merger talks with SG Warburg had been terminated.
JP Morgan extended the previous day's fall by Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 57 3/8
. The bank said on Wednesday that fourth-quarter earnings would not be as
high as those of the third quarter because of declining trading revenues,
and yesterday an analyst at Goldman Sachs lowered his rating of the
commercial bank from 'market performer' to 'market underperformer'.
Sprint tumbled Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 26 7/8 after the company announced
that it expected fourth-quarter income to be below that of the third
quarter.
General Mills added to gains made on Wednesday afternoon after the company
said it would spin off its restaurant division. In the wake of that
announcement, analysts at two securities firms raised their ratings on the
stock. The stock climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 57 5/8 yesterday.
Canada
Toronto posted its second straight day of broadly based gains, with only the
gold shares group trailing.
The TSE 300 index ended 32.88 ahead at 4,111.73. Rises outpaced declines by
452 to 293 after volume of 57.7m shares. Golds was the only easier sector,
losing 0.94 per cent in spite of the New York spot bullion price adding
USDollars 1.50 an ounce.
Brazil
The Sao Paulo market fell 2.7 per cent, pulled down by tumbling prices in
the electricity sector as Congress failed to approve a new concessions law.
The Bovespa index finished 1,342 down at 48,426.
Turnover was a robust RDollars 528m, with RDollars 238m seen in options
trading ahead of the expiry day next Monday.

FT  16 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Golds weaken in S Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg was mixed, with gold shares, which had earlier been in positive
territory, turning back later in the day to close with a loss of 60.3 at
1,831.6. Brokers attributed the change in sentiment to technical trading
related to options expiry.
The overall index moved ahead 29.3 to 5,666.6 and industrials 73.6 to
6,827.3.
Dealers said the market did not respond to a stronger financial rand, which
increases the price foreign investors pay for domestic shares. Among golds,
Dries fell R3 or 5.2 per cent to R55 and Kloof R1.25 to R54.75.

FT  16 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Siemens boosts Dax ahead of
triple-witching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some bourses were thankful for the overnight rise in the Dow, writes Our
Markets Staff. But at the end of the European day, they seemed unwilling to
move on the prospect that Wall Street could rise for the second day in
succession.
FRANKFURT waxed on Wall Street's overnight gains and on short-covering ahead
of today's 'triple-witching' expiry of DTB options and futures contracts.
The Dax index rose 27.82 to 2,052.59 on the session, with 16 points of that
due to post-bourse gains on Thursday.
Turnover was flat at DM5bn. After hours, the Ibis-indicated Dax held its
ground, closing at 2,054.23. Mr Jens Wiecking, at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf,
said that 2,050 on the Dax was a crucial level for dealers ahead of the
derivatives expiry; and that they had achieved this by bumping up the price
of a few index heavyweights, particularly that of Siemens which ended the
afternoon with a gain of DM18.50 at DM624.50. The electrical group's results
and prospects, laid out yesterday, were in line with expectations.
Meanwhile, a better than expected report from Degussa last Tuesday earned
more rewards, the shares rising a further DM13.80 to DM447 for a three-day
gain of 5.8 per cent.
PARIS managed a slight rise in a session characterised by mixed trading. The
CAC-40 index added 1.08 to 1,931.10 in turnover of around FFr3bn.
Following strength during the early part of the day, weakness in the bond
market later reversed the trend.
Peugeot lost FFr6 to FFr747 after announcing that second half results would
be more or less in line with earnings during the first six months of the
year. Renault eased 50 centimes to FFr179.80 as it confirmed that it was to
cut 1,735 jobs, while Michelin moved FFr2.40 ahead to FFr194.20.
Euro Disney rose another 15 centimes to FFr9.75, as it built on Wednesday's
gains which came after the theme park operator said that it was to cut
admission prices.
AMSTERDAM took in another steep fall in Fokker, off a further 16 per cent as
the shares slid to a close of Fl 10.30. Not even news that it had secured an
order for the sale of three of its 70 series aircraft to an Austrian
operator could brake the downturn.
Investors have been unnerved by the announcement from the aircraft maker, in
which Dasa of Germany has a majority stake, that it would be unable to make
progress on cutting its losses this year, partly as a result of its exposure
to the weak dollar. While Fokker's costs are incurred in guilders, the
aircraft are sold in dollars.
The AEX index added 0.50 to 407.69, down from a session high of 409.221.
Unilever closed with a strong rise of Fl 2.10 to Fl 199.30, helped by a
broker's buy recommendation, while KPN remained actively traded, putting on
a further Fl 1.10 to Fl 56.70.
ZURICH held on to most of its early gains, as fears of US inflation subsided
after Wednesday's economic data. The SMI index finished 16.6 stronger at
2,598.0.
Further strength in the pharmaceutical sector led the market higher. Roche
certificates added SFr80 to SFr6,080 and Ciba, which reiterated its forecast
of a slight increase in operating profits for 1994, rose SFr6 to SFr772.
CS Holding eased SFr4 to SFr529 on selling sparked by a newspaper report
that Orange County, California planned to file a suit against its CS First
Boston subsidiary.
Swiss Re was SFr10 higher at SFr789 as investors awaited a press conference,
after the market closed, at which the insurer and CS Holding announced a
strategic alliance to develop financial derivatives on reinsurance products.
Landis &amp; Gyr extended Wednesday's advance rising SFr35 to SFr795, in a
further response to the company's higher net profits and dividend. The share
was further supported by a Credit Suisse buy recommendation.
SMH rose SFr20 to SFr618 with the announcement that it expected a lower 1994
profit coming as little surprise.
MILAN moved ahead on bargain hunting fuelled by some foreign demand. The
Comit index rose 8.92 or 1.5 per cent to 591.83, many investors apparently
having now discounted the early departure of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime
minister.
Bargain hunting lifted blue chips, Telecom Italia rising L169 or 4.7 per
cent to L3,762 and Fiat picking up L166 to L5,498, recouping all of
Wednesday's fall.
Credito Romagnolo added L536 to L18,347 as investors awaited news from
Cariplo on whether it would launch a bid to rival Credito Italiano's offer.
Italiano picked up L51 to L1,621.
Cartiere Burgo jumped L275 to L10,118 as it received another recommendation,
this time from Mr Nicholas Potter at Credito Italiano International. With
reduced energy costs, more modern plant and an improving paper price, Mr
Potter expected the company to hit peak margins easily in 1997 and he
forecast significant potential for the share price to rise over the next two
years.
MADRID, down for its sixth trading day in succession, traded in line with a
Kleinwort Benson prediction that short term bond market weakness could push
equities lower. The general index fell another 1.91 to 297.43.
However, Ms Clare Miles of KB was still looking for a medium term recovery,
saying that bond market stability and a recovery in consumer confidence, as
well as stronger economic growth could take the index up to 345 by the end
of next year.
HELSINKI was lifted by the forestry and engineering group, Repola, and the
telecoms-based Nokia. The Hex index closed 13.0 ahead at 1,818.6, Repola
putting on FM2.90 at FM84.90 on its plans to list its engineering
subsidiary, Rauma. Nokia rose FM6 to FM680 following overnight gains on Wall
Street.

FT  16 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Contrasts in Chinese
stocks as Nikkei tops 19,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PATTON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Stocks moved up in active trading as institutional players returned to the
buy side, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average gained 189.63 at 19,121.12, its first close above
19,000 in a week. It ranged from a low of 18,964.19 to a high of 19,177.54,
profit-takers cutting back some of the rise near the close.
Volume increased from 219.4m to an estimated 269m shares. The Topix index of
all first section stocks advanced 10.75 to 1,508.79 and the capital-weighted
Nikkei 300 added 2.29 at 279.08, while rises led falls by 694 to 275, with
198 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 3.45 at
1,261.60.
Futures-linked transactions were once again a factor in early trading, when
overnight gains in Chicago futures prompted arbitrageurs to purchase Tokyo
shares. Heavy buying by domestic financial institutions through Daiwa
Securities and Goldman Sachs also pushed up prices in the morning.
Life insurance companies continued to buy shares through domestic brokerage
houses. Their targets included Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance, up Y15 at
Y742, and trading house Marubeni, ahead Y5 at Y530. Other trading companies
also advanced, Sumitomo adding Y15 at Y1,010 and Mitsubishi Y20 at Y1,300.
Boosted by a business daily report projecting a 32 per cent year-on-year
increase in consolidated pre-tax profits, automotive electronics parts maker
Nippondenso firmed Y10 to Y2,060. It is a major supplier to Toyota, Y10
higher at Y2,070.
Most other auto makers strengthened. Nissan moved up Y5 to Y810 in the day's
sixth highest volume of 3.6m shares. Honda gained Y20 at Y1,710, but Suzuki
Motor was off Y10 at Y2,110.
Privatised stocks were mixed. Japan Tobacco rose for the second straight
day, adding Y7,000 at Y914,000. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained Y7,000
at Y848,000, but East Japan Railway slipped Y2,000 to Y467,000.
Steelmakers advanced on active buying by investment trust fund managers.
Nippon Steel, the day's volume leader, climbed Y6 to Y363, Sumitomo Metal
Industries Y7 to Y315, Kawasaki Steel Y8 to Y405 and NKK Y4 to Y268.
Shipbuilders also firmed. Hitachi Zosen was up Y7 at Y532, Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Y9 at Y723 and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Y5 at Y442.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 112.97 to 20,851.46 in volume of 148.5m
shares.
Roundup
The region was very active yesterday.
HONG KONG was lifted 3.2 per cent as both domestic and foreign investors
made selective purchases of blue chips. The Hang Seng index rose 262.21 to
8,259.56 in turnover of HKDollars 3.6bn, compared with HKDollars 3.8bn on
Wednesday.
Brokers said previously oversold property and banking stocks were the most
sought after. Swire Pacific 'A' led gainers, adding HKDollars 2.60 or 5.8
per cent at HKDollars 47.30.
Wing Lung Bank forged ahead 4.9 per cent to HKDollars 53, China Light 5.9
per cent to HKDollars 33.70 and Wharf 6.6 per cent to HKDollars 24.90.
The H-share index of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong was also pushed up,
jumping 73.32 or 7.3 per cent to 1,077.13. Brokers attributed the gain to a
technical rebound after being heavily oversold in the past few days.
SHANGHAI saw a contrasting performance between the A shares, available to
domestic investors, and the B shares, which are traded by foreign
institutions. While the B index closed 1.6 per cent down at a year's low of
59.998, the A index surged 7 per cent to 689.561.
Brokers put down weakness in the B index to the disappointing performance of
Shanghai New Asia Group, the hotel and restaurant concern which made its
debut this week. It fell 7.42 per cent from an issue price of Dollars 0.350.
Analysts said the New Asia listing had come at a time when some foreign
investors were repatriating funds following the recent round of rises in US
interest rates, and expectations that the US Federal Reserve would lift
rates again in the short term.
Regarding the interest in domestic stocks, Credit Lyonnais remarked that
this was a result of unconfirmed reports that the total share issue quota in
1995 would be reduced from Rmb5.5bn to Rmb2bn.
In Shenzhen, the A index gained 10.8 per cent at 152.49 and the B index fell
3.56 per cent to 89.90.
SYDNEY closed sharply higher, boosted by Wall Street's strong overnight
performance. The All Ordinaries index rose 31.2 or 1.7 per cent to 1,895.0
in turnover of ADollars 472m. Gains were concentrated in industrials.
The futures contract ended at a 14-point premium to the cash market, with a
rally of 2.1 per cent.
SINGAPORE rallied sharply on bargain hunting following recent losses. The
Straits Times Industrial index added 66.23 or 3.13 per cent at 2,180.23.
KUALA LUMPUR built on Wednesday's 4 per cent advance. The composite index
put on 13.62 or 1.45 per cent at 950.77, after hitting a high of 964.82 in
the morning. Profit-taking in the afternoon generally pared rises.
WELLINGTON gained momentum in the afternoon, helped by a rise in forestry
stocks. The NZSE-40 capital index firmed 10.5 to 1,906.22 in turnover of
NZDollars 54.7m.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Italian lira firms in spite of political
uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian lira yesterday finished firmer on the foreign exchanges in spite
of lingering political uncertainty in the country, writes Philip Gawith.
The currency closed in London at L1,039 per D-Mark from L1,042. It was
buoyed by rallies in the futures and equity markets, where foreign buying
was evident. The lira was also helped by some D-Mark selling, as investors
took profits following the recent rally.
Although Italy appears most likely to provide some sort of currency move in
the Christmas period, markets are showing increasing signs of having shut up
shop for the year.
The only scheduled events now likely to shift foreign exchanges from their
torpor are the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting next Tuesday, and
the Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday.
The dollar had a very subdued day, finishing little changed at DM1.5718,
from DM1.5691, and at Y100.31 from Y100.26. It ended in New York at DM1.5710
and Y100.375.
Sterling also traded in a very narrow range, with the trade weighted index
unchanged all day at 80.3. It closed at DM2.4542 and Dollars 1.5615.
In Europe, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, said the
franc had room to appreciate. He added that the Bank was determined to keep
the franc stable during the coming presidential elections. It recently
touched a 12-month low.
Financial markets appear now to be working on the premise that Italian Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi and his government will not survive. Not only is
opposition outside the government intensifying, opposition from within the
coalition has picked up.
Political analysts have also interpreted negatively the length - seven hours
 -of Mr Berlusconi's meeting, earlier this week, with magistrates
investigating corruption.
Mr Giorgio Radaelli, international economist at Lehman Brothers, said he
felt fairly sure that Italy would have a new government by early February.
The implications of this scenario for the lira, however, are uncertain.
Mr Radaelli comments: 'I think the lira has pretty much discounted all bad
news. The foreign component of the market particularly would like to see a
new prime minister. There was a clash between Berlusconi and Bossi (a
coalition partner) which made this government very unproductive over the
past three months. The bond market also did not like Berlusconi's populism.'
On the other hand, markets are worried about a possible government hiatus
lasting a few weeks. Mr Radaelli said these concerns had the potential to
take the lira lower, although this could be offset by the passage of the
budget.
While the dollar is trading steadily, the short-term risks appear to be on
the downside. The price component of the Philadelphia index was weaker than
market expectations. It was the latest of a string of figures suggesting
that the Fed might leave interest rates on hold when it meets next week.
The March Eurodollar contract rose to 92.81, from 92.76, reflecting the
market's increasing conviction that rates may not rise until the new year.
Mr Peter Luxton, analyst at MMS, said: 'The dollar is a bit vulnerable to
that. It has been built up on expectations of a Fed tightening.'
The dollar has rallied since late October. It has risen by around 5.5 per
cent against the D-Mark, and 3.5 per cent against the yen. While many
observers have wondered whether this might mean the dollar has bottomed,
dollar bears remain unrepentant.
A Swiss Bank source said the dollar was more likely to see Y80 before Y120.
Contrary to analysts suggesting that the US's current account deficit had
peaked, he said the 1994 figure could get close to the 1987 record, with
1995 perhaps exceeding it.
Also bearish is SG Warburg, which remains 'fundamentally negative about the
dollar . . . our view is that the late 1994 recovery in the dollar
constitutes little more than a pause in its downtrend and renewed
depreciation to around DM1.40 and Y93 lies ahead over the next several
months'.
On a 12 to 18-month view, however, the investment bank believes a cyclical
recovery will take the dollar back to around DM1.65 and Y112.
In its daily operations, the Bank of England cleared a Pounds 1.35bn
shortage at established rates. Overnight money traded in the 4 to 6 1/2 per
cent range.

FT  16 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
World demand for wool at auctions around the world has been strong enough to
maintain prices in the final week before the Christmas recess in the selling
season. Merinos have tended very slightly dearer from time to time, New
Zealand crossbreds tended to ease again, and some British wools sold at
usefully higher prices at this week's Bradford auction. With British wool
demand stemmed originally from China rather than local processors who
normally dominate this sector. Elsewhere in the raw wool market is not
reflected in current demand from the retail end of the trade. Trading
conditions in the high street are extremely competitive and the
manufacturing industry continues to find it very difficult to pass on cost
increases in wool, with currency rates adding to the rises, as well as rises
in other fibre costs.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU agriculture ministers agree
environmental set-aside plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Union farm ministers agreed yesterday to draw up new rules on
cereal acreage set-aside enabling farmers to plant trees or opt for
environmental improvement schemes on idled land.
Farmers are required to set aside 12 per cent of their arable land this year
in an effort to curb over-production of cereals. Under the current rules,
producers are not allowed to use land planted with trees or turned over to
environmental management schemes to count towards their set-aside
allocation. Environmentalists say this has discouraged many farmers from
taking up some of the schemes that are available.
The UK has been pushing hard for a change in the set-aside rules and
welcomed the council's commitment to link market and environmental
set-aside. The European Commission will now draw up formal proposals.
Mr William Waldegrave, UK agriculture minister, said: 'The Commission's
report endorses our view that we should be allowed to promote more
environmentally sensitive use of set-aside, especially on marginal land'.
Farmers are expected to be able to put their set aside land into a variety
of schemes including: recreating flood meadows, grazing marshes and other
wetlands, re-establishing lowland heath land, creating reed-beds to benefit
wildlife as well as planting trees.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said the decision 'has taken a
very important step towards restoring the UK countryside'.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME copper market touches 5 1/4
 year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Copper prices on the London Metal Exchange yesterday surged to their highest
levels for five and a quarter years. Aggressive buying by traders, producers
and consumers helped the market move upwards, analysts said. That attracted
new money from investment funds, which swamped some profit-taking by other
funds.
Prices suggested that supplies of copper for immediate delivery were tight.
At the close last night the backwardation, or premium for immediate delivery
compared with delivery in three months, widened from Dollars 52.50 a tonne
on Wednesday to Dollars 59.50.
Traders reported there was nervousness in the market about the approaching
'third Wednesday' options activity next week which also focused attention on
copper's supply tightness.
'Copper will remain tight until significant new supply hits the market - and
that's six months away,' said Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain &amp; Co, a
Deutsche Bank subsidiary. He suggested the three-month copper price, which
closed last night at Dollars 2,979.50 a tonne after reaching Dollars 2,990
at one point, was on target for Dollars 1.40 a pound (Dollars 3,085.60 a
tonne). 'I would not be surprised to see copper at Dollars 1.50 to Dollars
1.60 a pound in the first quarter (of 1995),' Mr Bielski added.
Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, said
copper had 'the best fundamentals' of any of the LME-traded metals. In his
monthly metals report he suggested copper could reach Dollars 1.40 to
Dollars 1.50 a pound and that 'the high will probably come during the second
quarter, which traditionally is the strongest quarter for (metals)
consumption'.
He recalled that the highest price paid for LME copper was Dollars 3,707 a
tonne or Dollars 1.68 a pound on December 8, 1988, at which time the
cash-to-three month premium was Dollars 546 a tonne.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Miners find grounds for
optimism in PNG - The resource-rich but notoriously unpredictable Pacific
nation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three months ago, mining companies held their breath as the government
changed in Papua New Guinea, the resource-rich but notoriously unpredictable
Pacific nation.
Out went Mr Paias Wingti, the former prime minister, whose administration
was regarded as maverick and internally divided. In came Sir Julius Chan,
PNG's first finance minister after independence in 1975, who previously held
the prime minister's job between 1980 and 1982.
In its first 100 days, the new Chan government has given the resources
community some grounds for optimism. Negotiations over the potential
structure of the large ADollars 1bn-plus Lihir gold mine project, a joint
venture between Britain's RTZ and Niugini Mining, have resumed. Last week,
in Sydney, Sir Julius said he viewed 'fast-tracking' this development as
second in importance only to resolving the secessionist dispute which has
been raging on the PNG-controlled island of Bougainville.
Even more recently, Mr John Giheno, PNG's mining minister, returned from a
meeting with landowners in Lihir, saying that all parties had agreed to work
towards a February 28 date for the issue of the 'special mining lease',
which would allow the project to proceed. The SML was originally due a year
ago, but differences within the Wingti government ground the approval
process to a halt.
In the course of his Australian visit, Sir Julius also noted that Lihir was
not the only project to be progressing. He pointed to the recent final
go-ahead for an oil refinery to be built at Motukea Island, close to Port
Moresby, the capital. This would be the country's first major refinery and,
assuming finance is organised, could get under way by the middle of next
year. The international consortium behind the project has retained
Prudential-Bache's Australian office to look at local listing possibilities.
The PNG prime minister said that there had been a 16 per cent increase in
'grassroots' exploration expenditure in PNG in 1994 and held out the
prospect of a further rise in 1995. The number of new licences granted in
1994 was twice the 1993 level, he said.
But resources policy and economic development have always been closely bound
together in Papau New Guinea, and while some clouds have been lifting on the
former score, the latter has become increasingly obscured.
By its own admission, the PNG government is facing a serious cash crunch.
Stories have circulated of unpaid bills, including some owed to Australian
exporters. Mr Chris Haiveta, PNG's finance minister, has denied that there
will be any reneging on obligations, but conceded that people will 'have to
wait in line'.
Senator Gareth Evans, Australia's foreign minister, has said that his
country has brought forward remaining 1994 aid payments to PNG - which total
around ADollars 300m - to help alleviate the short-term situation while the
country goes about negotiating longer-term facilities with the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank. Mr Peter Sullivan, vice-president of the
Manila-based Asian Development Bank, recently described PNG's macroeconomic
problems, which are largely blamed on runaway public expenditure, as an
'emergency'.
But aside from promoting PNG's desire to fast-track developments to provide
future income and growth, this economic plight could have direct
repercussions for a number of existing resource projects.
First, there are suggestions that the PNG government may not now complete
the vexed deal that was designed to see it lift its stake in the large
Porgera gold mine from 10 per cent 25 per cent. This was to be achieved by
the purchase of additional 5 per cent interests from the three commercial
partners - Placer, Renison Gold Fields and Highlands Gold.
The companies involved say there has been no formal reopening of
negotiations over Porgera, although the rearrangement of equity stakes
should have been completed many months ago. However, the notion has been
sounded informally in Port Moresby. The additional shares were to be bought
for around K140m (Pounds 77m), money the government certainly lacks at
present.
Secondly, there is the question of whether the government tries to raise
funds from the disposal of other resource interests, such as its 22.5 per
cent share in Kutubu. According to Mr Haiveta, McIntosh, the Australian
broking firm which has an office in Port Moresby, had been asked to do a
full valuation of all assets. Both he and Sir Julius also remain
enthusiastic about the prospect of a local PNG stock exchange, on which some
holdings might eventually be sold.
But whether such moves persuade the international investment community that
PNG has become a significantly better risk, when the economic situation
remains so parlous, has yet to be seen. An abrupt decision to float PNG's
currency, the kina, last October, may not have helped, smacking for some of
the country's familiar unpredictability. 'I think people want to see runs on
the board,' says one mining executive.
Last week, Sir Julius was being realistic. Noting that his own ascent to the
office has already come under legal challenge from political opponents -
precisely the maneouvre that felled Mr Wingti - he said only that he hoped
to see 'a little glow at the end of the tunnel' in six months time.

FT  16 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Cocoa futures firmer - Market
Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COCOA futures closed firmer at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday,
helped by short-covering and technical chart support. A bullish New York,
fuelled by investment fund and speculative buying, was also encouraging,
traders said.
The March contract closed Pounds 42 up at Pounds 973 a tonne, and just off a
high of Pounds 985.
'Short covering has been the main dynamism but there was also a strong
technical motivation,' a trader said.
There was little momentum driving the PRECIOUS METAL markets after a
lack-lustre morning and quiet start to the New York session, dealers said.
GOLD continued to edge higher, closing in London at Dollars 379.85 a troy
ounce, up 75 cents on the day and Dollars 2.25 on the week so far.
At the London Metal Exchange NICKEL's recovery from its early-week shake-out
continued at great pace with speculators falling over themselves to get back
into the volatile market. Short-covering and stop-loss buying fuelled the
rise, which saw three months business up to Dollars 8,890 a tonne before
trade selling and profit-taking reversed the trend.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Old gold mines index to go
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Financial Times will cease calculating and publishing its old gold mines
index after February 28, 1995. The index, which is based on the performance
of South African companies only and was launched in September, 1955, was
replaced by one with a broader scope earlier this year.
Gold mining companies from all over the world are included in the new index
if they:
Have sustainable, attributable gold production of at least 300,000 ounces a
year;
Draw at least 75 per cent of revenue from mined gold sales;
Have at least 10 per cent of their issued capital available to the investing
public.
These conditions mean that there are no set number of constituents and the
eligibility of each company will be reviewed four times a year.
Copies of the list of constituent companies and of the ground rules of the
FT Gold Mines Index are available from The Manager, FT Statistics, One
Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL. A disc with the index's history will be
available from the same address when calculation of the predecessor index
series ceases.
The Mining Journal provides technical and financial information to assist
calculation of the FT Gold Mines Index.
At present in the new index Australasia is represented by Dominion Mining;
Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie; Homestake Gold Australia; Newcrest Mining; Placer
Pacific; Plutonic Resources and Poseidon Gold. Canadian constituents include
American Barrick Resources; Cambior; Echo Bay Mines; Hemlo Gold Mines;
Pegasus Gold; Placer Dome and TVX Gold.
From Ghana there is Ashanti Goldfields and South Africa is represented by
Beatrix; Buffelsfontein; Driefontein; Elandsrand; Freegold; Harmony;
Hartebeestfontein; Kinross; Kloof; Randfontein; Southvaal; Vaal Reefs;
Western Areas; Western Deep Levels and Winkelhaak.
US Mines in the new index include Battle Mountain Gold; Homestake Mining;
Newmont Gold and Santa Fe Pacific Gold.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar price consolidation 'to
continue'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sugar prices are likely to stay in their current consolidation phase with
big importers such as China and Russia staying away until well into next
year, according to broker C. Czarnikow.
In its month Sugar Review Czarnikow said: 'Although renewed strength may
well emerge during the course of next year, there is now less certainty
about the direction which the market might take in the short-term and there
is likely to be a period of consolidation'.
The recent rise in sugar prices had taken place earlier than might have been
expected, it added.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Short-dated US Treasuries outperform the
long end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The recent trend of yield curve flattening was broken for the second day
yesterday as the short end of the market outperformed the long bond.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1/32 at
95 13/16 yielding 7.859 per cent but the two-year note was  1/8 higher at 99
1/2 , yielding 7.509 per cent.
The market reacted quickly to a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia that showed a decline in the index of December business
activity to 28.9 per cent. It is the second month running that the index has
shown a drop in activity.
That data, combined with low inflation figures released on Wednesday, added
to trader speculation that the Fed would not raise interest rates when its
open market committee meets on December 20. Earlier this week, opinion was
mixed on whether the Fed would boost rates again before the end of the year.
The Philadelphia Fed's survey is especially important because it is an early
indicator of trends for December.
The spread between two-year and 30-year Treasuries widened for the second
consecutive day, reversing a recent trend and causing a steepening of the
yield curve. Economists view flattening of the curve as an indication that
the market expects economic slowing. The curve had flattened steadily since
the Fed raised rates by 75 basis points in November.
UK government bonds were lifted yesterday by a rise in German government
bonds and figures showing a slowdown in UK retail sales growth.
Retail sales volumes were unchanged in November from October and up 2.5 per
cent from November 1993, against a year-on-year rise of 3.0 per cent in
October.
Mr Chris Anthony at Hoare Govett said: 'The sales figures have killed off
any fears of an imminent interest rate rise.' He said investors were likely
to examine closely the CBI survey and PSBR figures due out this morning.
Trading in gilts yesterday was very thin, and dealers pointed to five tap
stocks which were announced on November 28, but have not been sold and still
overhang the market.
Dealers also point to strong resistance to prices rising above a level of
102 3/8 and although yesterday the market touched this ceiling, it bounced
down each time.
The yield spread over German government bonds tightened from 118 to around
115 basis points, and dealers said there may be some switching into bunds at
this level.
The December long gilt future moved up  5/16 to around 102 1/4 in late
trading.
German government bonds edged higher but prices remained within the range of
recent trading levels.
Mr Stefan Schneider at S. G. Warburg in Frankfurt said the movement of bunds
yesterday mimicked US Treasuries. He said: 'I cannot see any major domestic
event shifting sentiment in the bund market.'
Analysts point to next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's
policy-making open markets committee as the next event which may have an
effect on bunds, but say that until then trading is likely to stay within
the 89.50 to 89.87 range.
The spread under Treasuries shifted out from 43 basis points to 45 in slow
trading and the March bund futures contract on Liffe rose by 0.03 on the day
to 89.76.
Italian government bonds rose yesterday, in what some analysts attributed to
investors covering their short positions.
Mr Simon Maggs at IBJ said: 'The government will almost certainly fall apart
at some point. The budget will almost certainly go through and then the
market will focus on what will happen in the political situation.'
He said investors were made nervous by yesterday's announcement that the
government was to provide L11,000bn to help repair flood damage, and its
intention to pay for this increased spending by larger taxes had not allayed
investors' fears.
The March bond futures contract on Liffe moved to around 99.49 in late
trading, a rise of 0.81.

FT  16 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Cazenove plans India fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cazenove is hoping to raise Dollars 50m from investors in London and the
Gulf for a new closed-end Indian investment fund, to be managed by Chescor.
The Oryx fund will concentrate on medium-sized and smaller companies, with
more than 70 per cent in listed companies and about a quarter in unlisted
investments.
The fund will be based in Guernsey, but listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Investments will be made through Mauritius, to take advantage of its double
taxation treaty with India. The fund aims to be 90 per cent invested within
six months of launch.
Chescor is a small London-based investment house which has already been
involved in setting up an India fund for Martin Currie.

FT  16 DEC 94 / International Bonds: Euroyen deals meet strong Japanese
demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong Japanese investor demand for yen-denominated assets brought a further
flood of issuance to the euroyen sector yesterday as the Republic of Austria
launched two offerings of yen-denominated bonds, totalling Y120bn.
Elsewhere, two borrowers revived the asset-backed sector of the sterling
market, with deals by Bristol &amp; West, the UK building society, and a group
of UK housing associations.
There was also a rush of new issuance by Brazilian borrowers in the dollar
sector to beat the feared imposition of higher capital requirements and
higher taxes on capital coming into the country, which would significantly
increase the cost of raising capital on international markets, dealers said.
Austria launched a Y60bn offering of six-year bonds priced to yield 2 basis
points over Japanese government bonds, and Y60bn of 10-year bonds priced to
yield 11 basis points over Japanese government bonds.
There has been a significant amount of issuance in yen over recent months,
as borrowers have taken advantage of strong demand for yen assets.
Japanese investors have shunned foreign currency assets this year to avoid
foreign exchange loss. Financial liberalisation in Japan has also had an
impact, allowing the primary placement of euroyen paper directly into Japan.
'There is also a feeling among Japanese investors that there is no upward
pressure on interest rates, so they are happy to invest at these levels,'
said one trader.
Austria's two offerings were placed almost entirely with Japanese investors,
joint lead manager Daiwa said.
The offering's two-tranche form was a result of distinct patterns of demand
from different investor sectors, a Daiwa syndicate official said.
The six-year issue was placed with Japanese non-life insurance companies and
regional co-operatives, while the longer-dated offering was sold to
life-insurance companies and public sector funds.
'Some of the big life insurers have significant cash positions and they are
looking very aggressively to invest these funds,' he said. The proceeds from
the offering were not swapped, sources said.
Clips No 1, a special-purpose vehicle set up by Bristol &amp; West, launched a
Pounds 150m offering of bonds of varying maturities backed by a portfolio of
commercial loans originated by the UK building society.
The main tranche was a Dollars 123.75m issue of 15-year bonds offering a
discounted margin of 31 basis points over Libor.
Lead manager Goldman Sachs said the offering was sold to investors in the UK
and France, predominantly banks but also insurance companies and money
funds.
UK Rents No 1, a special-purpose vehicle set up by a group of medium-sized
housing associations, launched Pounds 36.598m of bonds due April 2025,
backed by future rental income.

FT  16 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Bankers Trust faces sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US regulators are within days of issuing civil complaints saying Bankers
Trust violated anti-fraud provisions of securities and commodities laws in
sales of derivatives to Cincinnati-based Gibson Greetings.
The complaints will be significant beyond the Bankers Trust case because the
agencies involved reportedly have determined that the derivatives at issue -
complex forms of interest rate swaps - can be considered both futures and
securities, and are thus within the regulatory purview of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Until now, swaps have been considered neither securities nor futures, and
the swaps industry has grown rapidly in a largely unregulated environment.
Although legislative attempts to tighten the oversight of swaps have died in
the US Congress this year, the two agencies appear to be extending their
reach independently through their enforcement action against Bankers Trust.
In particular, a determination that over-the-counter derivatives are futures
would require swaps dealers to comply with the same tough anti-fraud and
sales practice rules that govern listed futures and options. The CFTC
exempted swaps from much of the US commodities law in 1992, but reserved the
right to enforce its anti-fraud provisions if a swap was determined to be a
future.
The CFTC is also drafting suitability rules for derivatives customers, and
is in the midst of a public comment period on that issue.
A source familiar with the Bankers Trust complaints said the bank is close
to reaching a settlement with the agencies, and is expected to agree to
sanctions and pay fines.
Bankers Trust earlier this month entered into an extensive written agreement
with its primary regulator, the Federal Reserve, that requires remedial
action on the way it markets derivatives to corporations. That agreement did
not specifically mention Gibson Greetings.
Last month, Bankers Trust also settled a lawsuit brought by Gibson Greetings
that complained that the bank failed to disclose essential information about
derivatives sold to the company.

FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Investors welcome spin-off of
General Mills restaurants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Investors have welcomed the decision by General Mills, the US food group, to
spin off its restaurant business and concentrate on breakfast cereals.
Yesterday its shares closed Dollars 1 3/4 higher at Dollars 57 5/8 .
The restaurant business, forecast to have revenues of Dollars 3.2bn in the
current financial year, has nearly 1,200 outlets, including the nationwide
Red Lobster and The Olive Garden chains.
Late on Wednesday, General Mills said it was divesting the company to
shareholders, giving them one share in the new business for each share in
the existing company. The restaurant company, so far unnamed, will be quoted
on the New York Stock Exchange.
General Mills said that after the split, it would become a tightly-focused
consumer food group with expected sales this financial year of about Dollars
5.5bn.
The move completes a long period of reorganisation for General Mills, during
which it has disposed of numerous peripheral business including
Kenner-Parker toys, Eddie Bauer clothing and Monet costume jewellery.
Mr Bruce Atwater, chairman and chief executive, said the latest divestment
would enhance shareholder value because separate organisations with separate
incentives would produce the strongest growth.
The split is due to take place in June next year when Mr Atwater, now 63,
retires. In the meantime, Mr Stephen Sanger, the 48-year-old president of
General Mills, has been appointed president and chief executive officer of
the company. Mr Joe Lee, General Mills's 54-year-old vice-chairman, will be
president and chief executive of the restaurant operation.
The spin-off comes as both parts of the business face tough competitive
pressures. The food side of the business, in particular, has been suffering
from tough competition in the US breakfast cereal market. Earlier this year,
General Mills cut promotional spending and slashed prices in an attempt to
increase market share.
The casual dining sector is also highly competitive in the US. Yesterday
General Mills produced figures for its second quarter to November showing
that restaurant profits had fallen by 3 per cent.

FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Sprint shares battered by price
pressure worries

<TEXT>
Shares in Sprint, the third largest telephone company in the US, fell 11 per
cent yesterday following a warning that fourth-quarter income would be hit
by price pressures in the long-distance market.
Mr Arthur Krause, executive vice-president and chief financial officer, said
long-distance income would fall from its third-quarter high of Dollars 165m,
although it would remain above 1993's fourth-quarter figure of Dollars 133m.
The change from the strong growth seen in recent months knocked Dollars 3
7/8 off Sprint shares, which closed at Dollars 26 7/8 .
'Competition for residential customers has intensified during the quarter
and we have seen price pressures in the business market,' Mr Krause said.
AT&amp;T, the biggest long-distance phone company in the US, recently launched a
marketing campaign.
Sprint said it planned to target advertising and marketing spending in
profitable areas, but refused to give further details.
Long-distance phone services account for the bulk of Sprint's income,
amounting to 71 per cent of its Dollars 230m net income in the third
quarter.
However, Mr Krause said Sprint expected growth in volume for the fourth
quarter compared with a year ago, adding that volume in the long-distance
division would increase by between 10 and 11 per cent.
The Kansas City-based group has formed a series of alliances in recent
months to meet the growing competition in the US telecommunications
industry. In October, it formed a partnership with three US cable companies
to provide telephone, entertainment and information services.
On Tuesday, Sprint announced an alliance with Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex)
to provide services throughout North America.
Sprint said at the time its alliance with Telmex would help it create a
seamless North American telecoms network. Sprint is already aligned with
Call-Net, a Canadian long-distance carrier, and operates four cross-border
fibre optic connections with Telmex between the US and Mexico.
Mr Krause said that local and cellular operations were continuing to perform
'in line with expectations'. Cellular operations, which accounted for 14 per
cent of the company's net income in the third quarter, were its fastest
growth area.

<TEXT>
National Health Laboratories, the US clinical laboratory company, is to
merge its clinical laboratories with those of Hoffman-La Roche, a division
of Roche Holdings, the Swiss drug and chemical group, to create a Dollars
1.7bn company.
The new company will be 'one of the largest clinical laboratories in the
US', according to NHL.
It will have a total of 40 laboratories, 17 of which are currently owned by
Roche.
Roche will bring its laboratory business, Roche Biomedical Laboratories, and
will invest Dollars 186.7m in cash for its 49.9 per cent share of the new
business.
Under the agreement, NHL shareholders will have a 50.1 per cent stake in the
new company, and will receive Dollars 5.60 cash for each of their shares.
The total payout to NHL is estimated at Dollars 475m.
NHL said the merger could mean cost savings of Dollars 90m in the first two
years.
The healthcare industry has seen severe cost pressure as a result of the
change to managed care.
Mr James Powell, currently president of RBL, will become president and chief
executive officer of the new company; Mr James Maher, CEO of NHL, will
become chairman.
The merger is subject to approval from NHL shareholders. MacAndrews &amp;
Forbes, which owns about 24 per cent of NHL, has agreed to vote for the
merger.
NHL shares closed Dollars  3/8 lower at Dollars 13 1/8.

FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Cariplo group plans counter-bid
for Rolo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A consortium led by Cariplo, the Milan-based savings bank, last night
announced plans to outbid rival Milanese bank Credito Italiano with a
L3,290bn (Dollars 2bn) offer for 70 per cent of Credito Romagnolo (Rolo) of
Bologna.
The planned counter-bid will involve Cariplo, IMI, the banking and financial
services group privatised earlier this year, and Cassa di Risparmio in
Bologna, another local bank. Cariplo could also enlist the support of other
groups, including Reale Mutua, the Italian insurance company which is a Rolo
shareholder.
The consortium plans to pay L21,500 a share, against the Credit offer of
L20,000, and bid for 70 per cent of Rolo rather than the 65 per cent stake
sought by Credit.
The Cariplo announcement was made after the Italian market closed, but
during lively trading earlier in the day, Rolo's shares rose by 3 per cent
to L18,347, and Credit's shares were up 2.5 per cent at L1,640.
Italian agencies reported that Rolo had received the Cariplo approach 'with
interest', and directors would discuss it at a board meeting tomorrow. The
Rolo board said two weeks ago that it would be up to shareholders to decide
on the merits of the Credit bid.
Cariplo and its allies could launch their bid as early as next week if they
receive the approval of the Bank of Italy and Consob, the stock exchange
watchdog. It would overlap with Credit's offer, which opens on Monday and
will run until January 16.
Cariplo - short for Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde - claims to
be the world's biggest savings bank, and the third biggest bank in Italy,
with total assets last year of more than L150,000bn. In the past few years
it has formed alliances with a series of local savings banks, giving itself
access to about 1,400 branches nationally, half of which it controls
directly.
Like many Italian banks, Cariplo is owned by a charitable foundation.
Adverse market conditions forced it to abandon plans for a flotation on the
Milan stock exchange earlier this year.

FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Highs and lows of forex hedging
 -A strong yen worked for some Japanese groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate casualties of the yen's sharp appreciation in the past five years
are a familiar story. Most of them are manufacturers who have been forced to
cut margins as the prices of their exports have risen strongly.
However, the increasing availability of more sophisticated corporate
treasury operations in the same period has meant that some companies have
been able to offset some of those losses by hedging in the forward foreign
exchange market.
At the same time, many businesses have seen their performance deteriorate as
a result of large losses on the same contracts.
Precisely who were the winners and losers and how big were their gains and
losses was unclear until this autumn, when companies were required for the
first time to disclose in detail their profits on currency hedging. A new
collation of company's results published yesterday by Tokyo Shoko Research,
a private financial research institution, shows the extent to which Japanese
businesses have used this particular derivative instrument, and how varied
the performance has been.
Total gains among companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange neatly
balanced losses. Altogether, 211 companies recorded losses of a combined
Y99.6bn (Dollars 992.1m) in the year to the end of September, as a result of
the yen's rise, while 162 reported gains of Y95.4bn.
Transport companies, especially airlines, proved the biggest losers. Between
them, companies in the transport sector lost more than Y56bn. Other losing
sectors were textiles and steel. Net losses for 15 textile manufacturers
were Y3.4bn, while eight steelmakers lost a net Y2.6bn.
As might be expected, securities companies recorded the largest net gains.
Between them, 12 brokers managed gains of more than Y6bn. Other net gainers
were transport and electrical engineering companies.
The country's two leading airlines both lost heavily as a result of
long-standing contracts to purchase US dollars at exchange rates that were
not realised. Japan Airlines (JAL) suffered the largest loss of any company,
at Y43.9bn, four times as large as the next biggest loser, All Nippon
Airlines (ANA) with losses totalling Y10.7bn.
JAL began hedging the dollar-yen rate in 1985, concluding contracts to buy a
total of Dollars 3.6bn at an exchange rate of Y165.97 to the dollar at a
series of stipulated dates. ANA made arrangements to buy Dollars 798m at an
exchange rate of Y111.85. Both companies' moves were intended to insure them
against a sharp depreciation of the yen in advance of contract payment dates
for the purchases of foreign air-craft.
In fact, the yen rose well above the contracted levels and continued to
rise. At the end of September 1994, the exchange rate stood at Y98.45 to the
dollar.
On the plus side, Nomura Securities registered the largest net profit, at
Y22.9bn, followed by Nippon Telephone and Telegraph at Y18.02bn.
The research organisation's study covered only forward exchange contracts.
Companies are not as yet required to give full details of their other
derivatives gains or losses.
Tokyo Shoko points out that the rapid growth in the use of derivatives in
the past few years makes it harder to tell the true state of a company's
financial operations. 'Future contracts disclosed this time are just a very
small part of off-balance-sheet derivatives dealings,' he says. 'Interest
rate swaps are particularly in the dark, but of growing significance.'
So the scale of most companies' dealings can only be guessed at. There is
little doubt that in Japan, as elsewhere, many companies have suffered
heavily in the past year from their derivatives trading.
The problem was glimpsed last month with the publication of results at Tokyo
Securities, a small stockbroker. Its exchange losses alone totalled Y3.1bn,
but in all the company lost Y32bn, almost a third of shareholders' capital.
The company acknowledged then that the bulk of that loss came from
fixed-interest derivatives trading.

mining groups, plans to ensure the viability of its Durban Deep mine by
merging it with the neighbouring Rand Leases mine.
Durban Deep, which had been scheduled to close earlier this year, will
acquire all the issued shares in Rand Leases in exchange for 2.9m new Durban
Deep shares.
Mr Peter Flack, Randgold chairman, said the transaction would significantly
reduce running costs through the introduction of a single overhead structure
for the two mines, and that he hoped to refinance the enlarged company in
the new year.
Full details will be released in January. The transaction is subject to the
approval of Durban Deep shareholders, who will meet in February to assess
the plan.
Normandy Poseidon, via its industrial minerals division, has acquired a 9.1
per cent interest in Queensland Metals Corporation, writes Nikki Tait in
Sydney. The 10.8m shares comprising the stake were placed with the
Adelaide-based mining and minerals group at ADollars 1.30 each, for a total
consideration of ADollars 14m (USDollars 10.8m).
Shell Australia confirmed yesterday that it had completed the sale of a 30
per cent stake in the Worsley bauxite alumina joint venture in western
Australia to Billiton Australia, part of South Africa's Gencor. The deal is
part of Gencor's purchase of much of the Shell group's international metals
portfolio. Shell Australia said a further 6 per cent interest in Worsley had
been sold to Reynolds Australia Alumina, part of the Reynolds Metals
Company, and that it expected to complete the sale of its remaining 1.5 per
cent stake to Nissho Iwai, a Japanese trading and publishing company, by the
end of December.
MIM, the Queensland-based metals group, said it planned to increase
Australian copper sales by 50 per cent, to 90,000 tonnes next year. It said
it was aiming to fill some of the shortfall which is likely to arise when
CRA's Southern Copper refinery and smelter at Port Kembla close in January.

An Dollars 850m seven-year revolving credit facility for Saga Petroleum,
Norway's largest independent oil producer, was signed yesterday in London,
writes Martin Brice.
Banks offered to lend a total of Dollars 1.26bn, but the loan was not
increased from its original Dollars 850m target.
The loan was arranged by ABM Amro Bank, Barclays Syndications and Deutsche
Bank.
Saga was formed in 1972, has a BBB+/Baa3 credit rating and plans to apply
for a stock exchange listing in the US in spring.

<TEXT>
Tenneco, the US energy and chemicals group, is spending Dollars 120m on two
investments at Tenneco Ventures, a subsidiary of the company's gas division,
Reuter reports from Houston.
It said it was making a Dollars 75m acquisition of Pennzoil's offshore
properties and investing Dollars 45m in a Tenneco Ventures energy investment
fund.
Tenneco said the two investments supported its strategy of redeploying
capital into 'higher-return growth opportunities in its natural gas,
packaging and automotive parts businesses'.
It said the Pennzoil agreement, involving offshore oil and natural gas
properties in the Gulf of Mexico, would add more than 90bn cubic feet of
natural gas equivalent to Tenneco Ventures' reserve base.
The exact size of the Pennzoil transaction would be determined once other
parties had decided whether to exercise preferential rights to purchase the
reserves.
It said the Dollars 45m earmarked for the energy investment fund would be
invested in a combination of production, development and exploratory
properties in conjunction with independent producers.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fuji Photo Film yesterday cited fierce competition in the domestic market
and the sharp appreciation of the yen as the main factors behind a 4 per
cent drop in full-year nonconsolidated recurring profits.
Revenues in the year to October 20 fell 6 per cent to Y798.6bn (Dollars
7.96bn) and recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax -
declined to Y120.9bn amid a difficult trading environment. Net profits were
4 per cent lower at Y67.9bn.
Trading was slow in all divisions, in spite of the introduction of new
products such as the world's smallest and lightest 8mm video camera.
The company was adversely affected by intense competition both at home and
abroad, as core markets remained stagnant amid sluggish private capital
spending.
Price cuts undermined efforts by the company to reduce costs through
rationalisation measures.
In spite of the moderate recovery in the domestic market, Fuji Photo Film
expects the trading environment to remain difficult.
The company will report results for a shortened financial year as it is
changing its year-end to March 31 from October 20. It is forecasting sales
of Y346bn, recurring profits of Y50bn and net profits of Y27bn for the five
months and 11 days to the end of March.

FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Venezuela plans Dollars 1bn in
oil-backed bonds
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Venezuelan government has been in talks with international investment
banks over the possibility of next year issuing up to Dollars 1bn of bonds
collateralised by oil revenues in the international market.
Mr Julio Sosa, finance minister, said yesterday the idea was to issue the
first of the bonds - some Dollars 250m worth - in the first quarter of next
year.
Six investment banks were 'very interested' in the plans. 'If we are
successful we will place up to Dollars 1bn,' he said.
The government plans to use the funds to repay some of its Dollars 9bn in
non-restructured foreign debt in order to avoid a bunching of debt
repayments in 1996, 1997 and 1998.
The debt to be repaid would be mostly bilateral debt owed to other
governments, some of which has been in arrears and which amounts to some
Dollars 5bn.
The government has separate plans to issue dollar-denominated paper in the
domestic market, also to be collateralised by oil royalties and likely to
carry a seven-year term and 10 per cent coupon.
This week, the government began issuing two-year paper in local currency in
a bid to mop up the liquidity washing around the economy following this
year's banking crisis.
The aim is to issue up to 160bn bolivars (Dollars 940m) of this paper. The
government has temporarily stopped the central bank from issuing 90-day
zero-coupon notes in a bid to encourage banks to buy the two-year notes.

<TEXT>
Clark USA, the oil refiner and distributor controlled by Toronto financier
Mr Peter Munk, has withdrawn a USDollars 250m financing because of weakening
capital markets, writes Robert Gibbens.
Clark, wholly-owned by Horsham Corp, Mr Munk's main holding company, had
planned to offer 7.5m shares publicly to raise Dollars 150m, and to issue
Dollars 100m of senior notes.
The shares would have represented one-third of the total outstanding. The
financing was to cover the acquisition of a Chevron refinery in the US.
'We won't sell our shares in a weak market,' said Mr Paul Melnuk, Clark
president. 'Clark is a successful independent refiner and marketer and
financially strong. We believe market conditions will improve later.'
Clark earned Dollars 20.4m in the first nine months, compared with a loss of
Dollars 4.9m last time.

J. P. Morgan, the US bank, warned that its profits for the last quarter of
the year would not match those of the previous three months, due to weaker
trading revenues, writes Richard Waters in New York.
The announcement signalled a weak end to the year generally for banks which
are active in the financial markets.
The consensus among analysts had been for earnings of Dollars 1.69 a share
in the latest period at Morgan, compared with Dollars 1.63 in the previous
quarter.
In the final three months of 1993, a period when bond markets around the
world remained strong, the US bank earned Dollars 1.92 a share.
In spite of the warning, the bank lifted its quarterly dividend by 7 cents,
to 75 cents.

FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: HK regulator cracks down on cash
commissions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), Hong Kong's corporate
regulator, yesterday said it would outlaw the payment of cash commissions to
investment fund managers in cases where trusts and mutual funds are offered
to the public.
In a decision which Jardine Fleming, Hong Kong's biggest retail fund
manager, described as a 'sledge-hammer to crack a nut', the SFC said that
all cash rebates to fund managers would have to be credited to the funds
from July next year.
It said that fund managers could keep cash commissions, or rebates, where
they manage funds on a discretionary basis, such as pension funds.
In this case the client will have to consent to the fund manager retaining
rebates and be given a periodic quantification of the value of rebates
retained.
The SFC said that managers could retain 'soft dollar' commissions. These are
where a stockbroker provides free research, computer software for portfolio
analysis, and hardware such as Reuters services.
The test would be that the benefits received are demonstrably beneficial to
investors.
Mr Stuart Leckie, chairman of Wyatt, the pensions consultant, said: 'I
believe it is an outcome that is very satisfactory under all circumstances.'
Fund managers said they could live with the decision although it meant that
management fees would probably have to rise. Some also said the end to
rebates would put pressure on fixed commission brokerages in Hong Kong.
The SFC foreshadowed its inquiry into commissions and 'soft dollars' this
summer. It raised a storm of controversy in Hong Kong, pitting Jardine
Fleming (a recipient of rebates) against Fidelity which is not allowed to
accept them but which does take 'soft dollars'.
Mr Henry Strutt, Jardine Fleming's managing director, said: 'We'll have to
look at it carefully to see what steps we can take to mitigate the
consequences.'
Of Jardine Fleming's USDollars 23bn under management some USDollars 4bn is
managed in authorised Hong Kong trusts. About USDollars 2bn is subscribed
from abroad so the manager may have to de-authorise some funds, or seek to
place them outside the SFC's jurisdiction to avoid the ruling.
Mr Ian Boyce, managing director of Schroders in Hong Kong, said his firm
will have to look at the fees it charges if rebates are to end.
'It is not going to be the end of the world for us, rebates are not that
important to us. But we will be looking closely at our fee structure,' he
said.

Nike's price is CDollars 27.50 per Canstar share compared with Canstar's
share price of CDollars 17 in the market at Tuesday's close.
Nike said Canstar's principal brands, Bauer and Cooper, had global
reputations and would give Nike entry into team sports equipment.
Canstar has a strong position in in-line skating, roller hockey and figure
skating equipment. Nike said Canstar would operate as an autonomous unit

subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAE, the world's leading aircraft flight simulator maker, has sold its Link
military division in the US to Hughes Electronics, a subsidiary of US
carmaker General Motors, for CDollars 213m (USDollars 153m).
The Canadian electronics group has been trying to sell the loss-making Link
division for some time. It represented nearly half CAE's total sales of
CDollars 1.1bn in fiscal 1994.
Link's problems, which are partly due to cuts in US defence spending, have
depressed CAE's stock price and hurt overall performance.
The price compares with CDollars 665m paid by CAE to Singer of the US, then
controlled by American financier Mr Paul Bilzerian, for Link in 1988.
This year CAE took a CDollars 396m charge for Link and announced more
rationalisation. It will take a further CDollars 30m special charge this
year.
CAE retains certain Link products in ship machinery control, oil process
control modelling, bio-medical and entertainment simulation. It has also
retained USDollars 160m of tax losses available against future US
operations.
CAE said it would now be virtually debt-free and would concentrate on
developing its simulator and electronic controls businesses worldwide.
Following the merger of Thomson-CFS and Rediffusion in Europe, only two big
players remain in aircraft simulators.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Proventus, the Swedish investment group, yesterday launched a SKr1bn
(Dollars 132m) bid to buy out the 37 per cent outstanding stake it does not
own in its subsidiary Aritmos, the sporting goods company which includes
Puma, the German sports shoe maker.
Proventus said it had acquired the 15.2 per cent stake previously held by
the Swedish food group Cerealia, which had been Aritmos's second chief
shareholder. It was offering SKr33 per share in cash for the remaining
Aritmos shares, a premium of SKr5 over the last paid price of SKr28 reached
before Proventus and Aritmos shares were suspended on Wednesday.
The total value of the Cerealia and remaining bid was SKr1.06bn, to be
financed by bank borrowing, Proventus said.
Proventus, 70 per cent controlled by Mr Robert Weil, a Swedish private
investor, has holdings in several industrial companies including Van Roll,
the Swiss group. But it has made sporting and leisure goods its main
interest since buying into Aritmos in early 1993.
Since it won control of Aritmos it has restructured the group, spinning off
the Monark Stiga bicycles and Abu Garcia fishing equipment divisions into
separate quoted companies in which Proventus retains majority shareholdings.
Aritmos is focused on Puma, a previously troubled company which returned to
profit in the first six months of the year, Etonic, the second biggest
supplier of golf shoes in the US, and Tretorn, a leading tennis ball maker.
Aritmos reported pre-tax profits of SKr224m in the first six months on sales
of SKr3.5bn, a turnround from a SKr722m loss last year.
The bid was favoured by the Aritmos board, but it declined to take a
definitive position until it had received an independent valuation. The
offer is conditional on acceptances assuring Proventus of 90 per cent
ownership by February 3, but Proventus said it reserved the right to
complete even if the response left it short of 90 per cent.

<TEXT>
The board of IRI, the Italian state holding company, yesterday agreed to
examine the bids for Ilva Laminati Piani, the state-owned flat steels
producer, in the hope of reaching a deal on the sale of the company before
the end of the year.
Two consortia are understood to have submitted offers for ILP. One is an
alliance between Lucchini, the private Italian steelmaker, Usinor Sacilor of
France and Bolmat, a company formed by two Italian steel traders.
The other links Riva, another private steel producer, and Tarnofin, a group
of local entrepreneurs.
IRI did not comment on the identity of the bidders or the content of the
offers yesterday, and is set to discuss the sale again at another board
meeting before Christmas. The holding company is under pressure from the
European Commission to complete the sale of ILP before the end of the year,
in line with a deal struck by EU ministers a year ago on state aids for
Ilva. If the offers prove unsatisfactory, IRI could start private
negotiations, or invite improved bids.
Snia BPD, the quoted Italian chemicals and fibres company which is part of
the Fiat group, is to invest about Dollars 50m in the construction of a
nylon wrapping production line in the Basilicata region of southern Italy.
The new line, operated by Snia BPD's Caffaro subsidiary, will have total
capacity of 4,000 to 5,000 tonnes a year and should start production in the
middle of 1996.
The company said the investment would help strengthen its position in food
packaging, while the group is planning to invest a further Dollars 15m over
four years in research and development covering other market sectors as
well.
The industrial and R&amp;D investments are part of a programme of development in
the region by Snia BPD, supported by the Italian state.

Porsche, the loss-making luxury sports car maker, has set up a five-year
DM300m (Dollars 191m) credit line to fund the launch of what Mr Wendelin
Wiedeking, chairman, described yesterday as the biggest product offensive in
the company's history.
The financing for new models - due in 1996 and 1997 and including the
lower-priced Boxster aimed at younger buyers - was arranged by Dresdner
Bank's Luxembourg subsidiary and J. P. Morgan, the company said.
Confirming a sharp reduction in losses to DM150m from DM239m for the year to
the end of July, Mr Wiedeking said the business was still on course to break
even in the current year. Overall sales were ahead of budget, he claimed.
However, he said car sales in the home market and France were tending to
weaken, and complained that the introduction in Germany of a 7.5 per cent
income tax surcharge next month was unlikely to encourage consumer spending.
Germany accounts for more than a third of Porsche marque sales, and is also
the most important market for the Mercedes-Benz E500, which it builds on
contract, and a souped-up joint-venture estate car, the Audi-Porsche Avant
RS2.
Porsche has close links with the VW group, owner of Audi, through Mr
Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman, who owns 10 per cent of Porsche.
Mr Piech yesterday repeated his appeals for the German government to pay a
scrapping premium for old cars to encourage new sales. He told VW workers
that a lasting revival was not yet in sight in the domestic market.
However, worldwide group deliveries to customers had increased 7.4 per cent
in the first 11 months with most growth in the US and Asia, he said.

FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Repola plans sale of up to 30%
of Rauma engineering unit

<TEXT>
Repola, Finland's largest industrial group, yesterday announced plans to
sell up to 30 per cent of the shares in its wholly-owned Rauma engineering
subsidiary to outside investors.
It plans to list Rauma on the Helsinki stock exchange to create 'a more
independent and high profile position' for the unit. Repola's main operation
is its forestry operation, United Paper Mills, which accounts for nearly 70
per cent of overall annual turnover of about FM27bn (Dollars 5.5bn).
Rauma has four divisions: Timberjack (forest machines), Sunds Defibrator
(fibre technology), Neles-Jamesbury (industrial valves) and Nordberg
(crushers).
The decision to sell part of the unit comes at a time when demand is
improving in all four divisions due to economic recovery and an increase in
machinery orders in the pulp and paper sector.
The group is benefiting from its strong position in the North American and
Asia-Pacific markets.
Exports and overseas activities account for about 90 per cent of Rauma's
annual turnover of about FM8bn.
In the first eight months of 1994, Rauma doubled its operating profit to
FM247m from FM124m as turnover climbed by an underlying 9 per cent to
FM5.18bn.
The unit's order book at the end of August was up 75 per cent at FM4.81bn.
The Rauma shares, which will be sold to domestic and international investors
next year, may be listed on an overseas bourse at a later date. Advisers to
the issue are S. G. Warburg Securities and Prospectus Oy.
Repola's shares ended the day FM3.50 higher at FM85.50.

FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Slovnaft offering returns next
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRATISLAVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Slovnaft, the Slovak petrochemical group that was forced to postpone a
planned Dollars 100m international share issue because of domestic political
instability and uncertainty on world stock markets, is to try again early
next year.
The offering, which will be the first such deal by a Slovak company, was
postponed in late November, but a senior official at Kidder Peabody, the US
investment bank leading the offering, said recently that it was scheduled to
be relaunched in the first quarter of 1995. 'We hope there will be a more
receptive market,' he said.
The offering is due to follow a rights issue of up to 3.3m shares to
existing Slovnaft shareholders. The state owns 80 per cent of the oil
refining and chemicals group, and the National Property Fund of Slovakia,
which administers state shareholdings, is believed to have indicated that it
will not take up its allotment.
This will allow those shares to be offered to foreign institutional
investors. The state's shareholding would then fall to about 65 per cent.
Other Slovnaft shareholders include Slovakia's large investment
privatisation funds.
There is still uncertainty as to the future of privatisation in Slovakia.
The new government headed by Mr Vladimir Meciar and appointed this week has
postponed a SKr60bn (Dollars 1.9bn) voucher privatisation programme in order
to remove electricity and gas distribution company shares from the sell-off.
Investment fund managers say this will reduce the size of the voucher
programme and dampen investor enthusiasm. The delay is expected to be for up
to three months. Since Slovnaft's decision to postpone the share issue its
supervisory board has been removed and replaced by allies of Mr Meciar.
Slovnaft's profits are expected to jump to SKr3bn this year compared with
SKr1.6bn in 1993.

FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Confident Siemens sees 20%
advance in profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Heinrich von Pierer, Siemens chairman, yesterday forecast a 20 per cent
surge in profits in the current financial year as Europe's biggest
electrical and electronics group emerged strengthened from a cyclical and
structural crisis.
In spite of further pressure on prices, more costly rationalisation and
unchanged earnings from financial investments, net profits would increase to
about DM2bn (Dollars 1.3bn), he claimed. Sales would rise only about DM1bn
above the DM84.6bn achieved in 1993-94, while order intake would increase by
DM1.5bn to about DM90bn at most.
News of brightening horizons at Siemens gave a lift to the Frankfurt stock
exchange and the group's own shares closed DM20.5 higher at DM623.
Mr von Pierer announced his medium-term target of raising the group's return
on equity to 15 per cent from 9.4 per cent in the year under review and an
expected 10 per cent in the current financial year.
In response to criticism that Siemens was too heavily focused on maturing
markets, he said world markets offered long-term growth of 5-7 per cent a
year. The group had no great strategic needs such as acquisitions to enter
new markets or fill technological gaps, he added, although spending on
stakes in joint ventures in Asia would increase.
Confirming a 17 per cent fall in profits in the year to September 30 -
although extraordinary gains from disposals bolstered the final figure to
DM1.99bn - Mr von Pierer noted higher productivity had cancelled out the
effects of higher costs and lower selling prices.
In an unusually detailed report on the year just ended, Siemens provided for
the first time a breakdown of earnings by division. This showed, as
expected, falling losses in the Siemens-Nixdorf (SNI) information technology
division and a much-reduced financial result.
The mainstay business in telecommunications equipment and services generated
DM1.12bn in pre-tax profits, while SNI lost DM391m. Power generation and
distribution earned DM104m, the industry division DM119m, transport
equipment DM201m, components DM300m, medical technology DM239m, and Osram
lighting - including the US Sylvania acquisition for the first time -
DM291m. Profits from the energy and industrial products divisions fell
because of lower sales, price pressure and heavy restructuring costs.
Telecommunications earnings were hit by falling demand from east Germany and
price cuts. SNI reduced its loss by an estimated DM100m in spite of
continuing price cuts and high restructuring costs. According to Mr von
Pierer, lower prices cost the group DM2.8bn last year, while restructuring
rose DM800m to DM2.7bn.
Further rationalisation, including the loss of at least 12,000 jobs after
21,000 last year, would incur additional expense, although Mr Karl-Hermann
Baumann, finance director, refused to elaborate. SNI would make its first
operating profit in the current year, he added, although restructuring
charges would mean a further net deficit.
Financial earnings would be about the same as in 1993-94, when they fell to
DM1.3bn from DM1.85bn.

FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Berlin bank proposes to raise
dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bankgesellschaft Berlin, Germany's sixth largest bank, intends to raise its
divided for 1994, Mr Hubertus Moser, co-chairman, said yesterday.
The plan to lift the dividend from last year's DM9 by at least DM1 was
announced as the bank gave details of 10-month results.
The bank was formed through the merger last January of the state-owned
Landesbank Berlin, the private Berliner Bank, and the private Berliner
Hypotheken-und Pfandbriefbank mortgage banks.
The bank's consolidated business volume rose to DM234.5bn (Dollars 147bn)
for the first 10 months of the year, compared with DM222bn during the first
six months of its operations. Real comparative figures on a year-on-year
basis will only be available in 1995.
Consolidated operating results rose to DM999m compared with DM734m from
January to June. After taking into account risk provisions amounting to
DM608m, operating results totalled DM669m.
The risk provisions, which amounted to DM326m during the first half of 1994,
had been increased because of Bankgesellschaft's exposure of DM100m to
Balsam, the sports grounds company which earlier this year ran up large
debts. The bank had a further DM70m of exposure from the collapse of the
Jurgen Schneider property company.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals help Acatos advance 40% to
Pounds 14.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rising edible oils prices kept margins under pressure at Acatos &amp; Hutcheson,
the manufacturer of edible oils and fats.
Pre-tax profits for the year to October 2 rose from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds
14.2m. However, the group pointed out that the 40 per cent gain was mainly
the effect of exceptional charges in both years relating to disposals and
restructuring.
Operating profits were flat at Pounds 13.7m, despite a 12 per cent increase
in sales to Pounds 249m (Pounds 222m).
The shares closed 14p ahead at 264p.
In addition to raw material price increases, the group faced increased
competition on prices, citing two other refiners seeking to lift volumes
'with little regard to profit'. The group said it had 'responded as required
to maintain our market share'.
The bulk of the group's business lies in supplying own brand oils and fats
to UK supermarkets; it has about 30 per cent of the market.
Mr Ian Hutcheson, chairman, said earlier this year that the insistence of
some customers that prices should be held in the face of unavoidable cost
increases had 'reached a level of unrealism we have not previously
experienced'.
At the end of September, the group said it was forming a strategic
relationship with Archer Daniels Midland, the US agribusiness group which
supplies its biggest refinery in London's Docklands.
It is also forming a 50-50 joint venture with the US group to build and
operate an edible oil refinery and bottling and canning plant beside ADM's
existing oil seed crushing plant at Erith, Kent.
Mr Hutcheson said yesterday that this, together with other joint ventures
and acquisitions, would 'further improve our competitiveness and I am
increasingly optimistic for the medium to long term once the planned
programme of restructuring and capital expenditure is complete'.
Earnings per share were up from 20.9p to 30.3p. A final dividend of 5.5p is
proposed, taking the total to 9p (8p).

Allied Radio, which operates licences for Radio Mercury and Mercury Extra in
the south-east and Fortune in Greater Manchester, reduced pre-tax losses
from Pounds 1.46m to Pounds 678,000 for the year to September 30.
The outcome, which included a Pounds 203,000 share of the start-up loss on
Mercury, was achieved on turnover down from Pounds 3.75m to Pounds 2.82m.
Allied underwent a capital restructuring in May, the effect of which was the
elimination of interest charges paid on the convertible unsecured loan
stock, which have been converted into ordinary shares.
Pro-forma losses per share based on shares in issue after the reconstruction
were 0.5p (1.1p).
With some Pounds 2m of cash, the board plans to invest in new and existing
licences.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Murray Johnstone to launch venture trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Murray Johnstone has announced plans to launch one of the new breed of
venture capital trusts, details of which were outlined in the last Budget.
Full details will be published in the Finance Bill next month, but the fund
management group is confident that it will be able to work with the
legislation.
Murray Johnstone plans to launch the trust within the first six months of
next year. It will be managed by Mr Iain Tulloch, its Glasgow-based venture
capital fund manager.
The group will be looking to raise between Pounds 15m and Pounds 30m.
Venture capital trusts will be legally restricted to investing mainly in
very small companies with assets of less than Pounds 10m, which increases
management costs.
However, Murray Johnstone aims to mitigate these by co-investing with other
venture capitalists.
Private investors are to be offered substantial tax breaks for investing in
venture capital trusts at launch. These include 20 per cent up-front income
tax relief on investments of up to Pounds 100,000 a year, tax-free income
and capital gains from the trust if the shares are held for at least five
years, and the possibility of deferring capital gains tax liabilities from
other investments if the gains are rolled into the trusts.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The costs of the reorganisation at its Hawkins Plant Services subsidiary and
higher interest charges resulted in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 5.1m at Barcom
in the year to September 30. This compared with profits of Pounds 2.06m
previously.
The civil engineering and plant hire group reported static sales of Pounds
31.4m for the period. There was an operating profit of Pounds 217,000
(Pounds 3.42m) but exceptional costs of Pounds 3.59m represented management
changes, depot closures and plant disposals related to Hawkins. In addition
interest took Pounds 1.78m (Pounds 1.5m).
Losses per share of 28.1p this time compared with earnings of 10.9p
previously and there is no dividend. Last year 3p was paid, including a
final of 1.75p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Smiths Industries, the aerospace and healthcare company, has expanded its
industrial group with two acquisitions in continental Europe.
The acquisitions - Sodiamex of France and Interplas, a Switzerland-based
company with operations in Italy, Spain and the UK - will be absorbed into
Smith's Flex-Tek ducting and conduit business.
Consideration for the purchases is Pounds 13.3m cash, with assumed
borrowings of about Pounds 5m.
Interplas, which specialises in suction and discharge hose for a range of
industrial activities as well as electrical conduit, is being acquired from
Walter Meier Holding, a Swiss public company. Sodiamex is a privately-owned
company specialising in ventilation ducting.
The total net assets of the two companies at the date of acquisition amount
to some Pounds 10m and operating profits for 1994 are estimated at Pounds
2.3m.

FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Greencore ahead 17% after lower
interest cost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greencore, the sugar, malting and milling group, reported a 17 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits from IPounds 33.7m to IPounds 39.5m (Pounds
38.9m) for the year to September 30, reflecting a sharp reduction in net
interest costs and further efficiency gains.
Sugar, agribusiness and other food operations all recorded increases in
profits. Only the malting business suffered a fall, reflecting difficult
marketing conditions and high domestic barley prices in 1993.
Group sales increased to IPounds 404.5m (IPounds 393.8m) including IPounds
175,000 (IPounds 1.46m) from discontinued activities giving an underlying
rise of 3 per cent.
This in part reflected a fall in sugar sales, following poor crop yields in
1993. Retail sugar demand, about 25 per cent of total sugar volume, showed a
small decline in a difficult market.
Mr Bernie Cahill, chairman, said agribusiness was responding well to reforms
of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. He welcomed the agreed reduction in
'set aside' - the land farmers are required to take out of production - from
15 per cent to 12 per cent, which would result in increased processing
volumes.
He added that the outlook for the Irish and Belgian malt businesses was
improving on the back of the upturn in the beer and spirits markets. Flour
and consumer food operations increased volumes, particularly exports.
Interest costs were cut by IPounds 5m to IPounds 4.26m, underlining
continued strong cash flow and reduced working capital requirements.
Earnings per share increased 13 per cent to 38.4p (33.9p) and a final
dividend of 6.2p is proposed for a total of 9.9p (8.8p).

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: GWR seeks easing of growth limit as profits
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GWR, the Bristol-based commercial radio group, yesterday renewed its appeal
to the government to relax the restrictions on station ownership.
Mr Ralph Barnard, chief executive, attacked what he called 'the ludicrous
anomaly' preventing GWR from expanding because it had the maximum 20
licences even though together they reach only 8m people. Other radio
companies, with fewer but larger licences, could reach 16m to 17m people.
'We are being forced abroad by this. We would much rather spend our energies
and our money in the UK,' said Mr Barnard, who expressed surprise at how
long it was taking the government to deal with what appeared to be a simple
issue.
He was speaking after the group announced trebled pre-tax profits of Pounds
3.1m (Pounds 900,000) for the year to September 30 on turnover more than
doubled at Pounds 21.7m.
Earnings per share came out at 38.4p (18.4p) and a proposed final dividend
of 7.5p makes a total of 13p (9p).
During the year acquisitions increased GWR's potential audience from 3m to
8m with the addition of stations such as Radio Trent in Nottingham and Derby
and the Mid Anglia group with stations in Peterborough, Cambridge and Kings
Lynn.
The acquisitions accounted for Pounds 1.1m of total operating profit of
Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 1m). The results did not include any contribution from
GWR's 17 per cent stake in Classic FM which is not yet paying a dividend.
Mr Henry Meakin, chairman, said that the present year had begun well 'with
revenues ahead of budget and strongly ahead of last year'.
James Capel, GWR's broker, yesterday raised its forecast for the current
year from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 4.5m.

Mid-States, the US motor parts distributor quoted on the USM, is proceeding
with its application to be traded on Nasdaq in the form of American
Depositary Shares but has deferred its proposed placing.
Mid-States had planned to raise Dollars 15m (Pounds 9.1m) through a placing
of ADSs at between Dollars 9 and Dollars 11 an ADS (equivalent to between
72p and 80p per ordinary share), but has been advised to postpone it because
of adverse market conditions.
The directors are unwilling to complete the issue at a price below 72p
because of the dilution this would cause for existing shareholders. However,
they may issue a small number of shares at a discount in order to obtain a
Nasdaq quote.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: LMS gains 30% with aid of property sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Merchant Securities, the property and investment company, reported a
30 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds
13.1m, helped by gains on the disposal of investment properties.
Net rental income improved from Pounds 14.8m to Pounds 15.7m in the six
months to the end of September, partly offset by a 25 per cent rise in
administrative costs to Pounds 2.6m. The company said these expenses
included the cost of its High Court action against shareholders in BSB
Holdings, the old British Satellite Broadcasting holding company which owns
14 per cent of BSkyB.
LMS claims the terms under which it was offered shares during BSB's 1991
rights issue were unfair. The case should come to trial in January.
The company's 5 per cent holding in BSB Holdings remains valued at nil in
the balance sheet despite the recent flotation of BSkyB.
Dividends received from First Leisure Corporation, the leisure company in
which LMS has a 14.6 per cent stake, contributed other income of Pounds
632,000 (Pounds 596,000).
Profits from the sale of investment properties were Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 2m)
and included proceeds from the disposal of assets held jointly with General
Accident, the insurance company. LMS said GA remained a large shareholder
and that opportunities for collaboration in new ventures were being
explored.
Earnings per share, including capital items, rose from 2.31p to 4.27p, but
fell from 1.97p to 1.48p on revenue profit alone. The interim dividend is
unchanged at 0.8p.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: A change of focus for ASW - Package marks
further rationalisation of European steel industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASW Holdings yesterday announced a clean break with its past by swapping its
Scunthorpe rod mill business for British Steel's 35.2 per cent stake in ASW,
the Cardiff-based steel and construction products group.
The transaction is part of a complex package of deals which mark a further
rationalisation of ownership in the European steel industry and give ASW its
first steel plants in continental Europe.
They include a 7-for-20 rights issue at ASW, to raise about Pounds 29m after
expenses, priced at 160p and payable in two instalments. It has been fully
underwritten by SG Warburg.
Other details of the package are:
The disposal by ASW of the Scunthorpe mill to British Steel in effective
exchange for the repurchase of 13.4m ordinary shares (20 per cent of ASW's
ordinary shares) and 30.8m Pounds 1 cumulative convertible preference
shares.
The stake held by British Steel dates back to the flotation of ASW in 1988.
British Steel said the consideration for the rod mill of Pounds 50m broadly
equates to the book value of its shareholding in ASW.
ASW will acquire for about Pounds 51m an 80 per cent stake in Societe Des
Aciers D'Armature Pour Le Beton (SAM), the steel mesh and reinforcement coil
(recoil) unit of Usinor Sacilor.
ASW will pay Pounds 32m cash and issue 10m new shares to Usinor, giving the
French group a stake of about 12 per cent in ASW. The Cardiff-based company
will, in certain circumstances, buy the rest of SAM for up to Pounds 19m
cash.
ASW will invest Pounds 17m in its Cardiff rod mill, to produce all its
present reinforcement bar (rebar) - now produced at Tremorfa bar mill - and
recoil in one operation. A related Pounds 2.1m restructuring charge is
expected for next year.
Sir Alan Cox, ASW's chief executive, said that, in looking for a better
ownership structure in the industry, it was inevitable to question whether
wire rod was a strategic business for ASW. It retains a small wire rod
operation in Cardiff.
British Steel already supplies steel billet to the Scunthorpe mill, which is
on the same site as its main Scunthorpe works and employs about 320 people.
It will be run as one business with British Steel's Templeborough rolling
mill in Rotherham.
Sir Alan said the SAM acquisition would turn ASW into 'a genuine company in
the European sense'. SAM had group sales of FFr2.32bn (Pounds 270m) last
year, and is forecasting sharply higher profits this year. It has already
been extensively restructured, but Sir Alan said there was considerable
scope for improving its operational cash flow.
ASW shares rose 20p to 215p yesterday. Because the shares held by British
Steel will be cancelled, The number of ASW shares outstanding will be
reduced from 83m to 82.6m even after the rights issue.
The directors said the transactions would enhance earnings per share in 1995
and forecast an unchanged 3p final for 1994, making 6p for the year.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Rejuvenated balance sheet behind recovery
at YJ Lovell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in YJ Lovell (Holdings) gained 7p to 60p yesterday after news that
its financial restructuring had returned the builder and property developer
to the black.
The turnround from losses of Pounds 59.6m to a pre-tax profit of Pounds
4.16m for the year to September was achieved on the back of a rejuvenated
balance sheet, which strengthened from a net liability position of Pounds
13.3m to show net assets of Pounds 62.2m.
The first dividend for three years is declared at 1p, on earnings per share
rose of 9.4p (712.3p restated loss).
Growth in all of the core businesses of construction, residential housing
and plant hire helped lift sales to Pounds 251m (Pounds 224m).
The restructuring package, agreed with a syndicate of banks last December,
injected Pounds 75.5m into the balance sheet through a Pounds 45.8m
debt-to-equity swap and a Pounds 29.7m rights issue.
The money was used in a substantial write-down of property and land in the
US and the UK's commercial property divisions and residential housing in
Spain. There was also fresh capital investment in the Plant Hire company -
which enjoyed windfall profits of Pounds 800,000 against a Pounds 1.7m loss
 -and in the residential business in the US and UK.
Group net debt was reduced from Pounds 94.2m to Pounds 25.5m, resulting in
on balance sheet gearing of 41 per cent.
Mr Bob Sellier, chief executive, said: 'Our order books are looking healthy
and we will continue to consolidate or discontinue our weaker businesses.'
The only area where profits fell was the Partnership division, which
provides social housing in conjunction with the UK's Housing Association.
Pre-tax profits fell 17 per cent to Pounds 2.9m, due to reduced sales and
government funding for social housing, said Mr Sellier.

<TEXT>
Apollo Metals swung back into profit during its second half to finish the
year to September 30 with pre-tax profits of Pounds 291,000, against Pounds
1.02m last time, writes Paul Cheeseright.
The company incurred a first-half loss of Pounds 219,000.
The outcome was slightly higher than the forecast made in October when the
aluminium and specialist steel distributor and processor launched a Pounds
7.79m rights issue to finance the acquisition of Aviation Metals.
Turnover rose from Pounds 28.2m to Pounds 33.7m, but after meeting
reorganisation costs in Germany, operating profits fell from Pounds 1.42m to
Pounds 564,000.
Although earnings per share were nil, against 5p, the group is confident
enough of trading prospects to hold the final dividend at 2.4p, maintaining
the total at 3.6p.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: CTR cuts loss to Pounds 7.2m as
exceptionals plummet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses at Central Transport Rental Group, formerly Tiphook, fell sharply in
the six months to October 31, declining from Pounds 179.7m to Pounds 7.2m,
as the company reported lower exceptional charges and an improvement in
trading.
The interest charge was halved at Pounds 20.6m (Pounds 40.6m) and the
results were additionally flattered by a Pounds 19.3m foreign currency gain
on its US bonds.
Mr Ian Clubb, the non-executive chairman who joined the board three months
ago, said the results marked a turning point in the group's fortunes.
In the past year, CTR has parted with several directors, run up hefty
losses, been forced to sell its container leasing division and had the
ignominy of its chief executive, Mr Robert Montague, facing bankruptcy
charges.
Turnover fell to Pounds 73.4m (Pounds 155.7m) for operating losses of Pounds
2.2m (Pounds 139.1m). However, the company said continuing operations showed
turnover ahead 8.5 per cent for operating profits of Pounds 9m, compared
with losses Pounds 2.4m.
Losses per share fell from 163.4p to 6.5p.
Sales in the trailer rental division improved by 9 per cent to Pounds 67.1m
as it pushed through rental rises of 3.4 per cent. Utilisation rates also
improved. In the rail wagon rental business, turnover rose Pounds 200,000 to
Pounds 6m.
Exceptional charges fell from Pounds 154.6m to Pounds 14.9m. This included
Pounds 2.2m in redundancy and reorganisation costs. CTR relocates this
weekend from its prestigious central London address to smaller premises in
High Wycombe with a central office staff of 30, a tenth of the figure
employed at its peak. Administrative expenses over the half declined from
Pounds 49.4m to Pounds 22.9m.
Mr Clubb said that with a four-year agreement with its bankers only recently
begun, the group had enough working capital to continue its operations and
maintain capital investment. A financial reconstruction was planned at some
stage, probably during 1995.
However, a contract with Schmitz, a German manufacturer of trailers with
which CTR has a long-term supply contract, was not provided for. The
contract would cost the group Pounds 161m over the next five years, with the
next payment of Pounds 18m due in April 1997.
'With our improving cash flow and market position, I don't see this being a
problem at all,' said Mr Clubb.
He reiterated the board's view that the personal finances of Mr Montague,
who has two bankruptcy writs outstanding and reputed debts of some Pounds
40m, were his affair. 'But he would not be working for us if he did not add
value,' he added.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Dobson Park raises Pounds 18m and buys rest
of Longwall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dobson Park Industries is making a recommended offer for the outstanding
41.1 per cent holding in Longwall International, it mining equipment
associate. It proposes to part fund the deal with a 1-for-4 rights issue at
62p to raise Pounds 17.7m net.
The shares eased 3p to 75p.
At the same time, the mining equipment, industrial electronics and toys
group revealed pre-tax profits more than doubled for the year to October 1.
Profits leapt to Pounds 10.5m pre-tax, at the top end of expectations. The
comparable Pounds 4.16m was struck after a Pounds 4.59m loss from the
disposal of the Power Tools and Revere Aerospace. Adjusted for the effect of
the disposals profits rose 20 per cent.
Turnover fell to Pounds 100m, including Pounds 4.47m from acquisitions,
against Pounds 123.4m, including Pounds 28.9m from discontinued activities.
Underlying turnover showed an increase of 6 per cent.
Earnings rose from 1.42p, or 4.65p adjusted, to 5.45p and the final dividend
is held at 2.55p for an unchanged total 3.75p.
Mr Alan Kaye, chairman, said the dividend could not be raised because of
bank covenants connected with the Longwall joint venture.
In January 1993 Dobson merged its mining equipment interests with Meco
International, a 1989 buy-out from Dowty, into Longwall. Dobson held 50 per
cent of the shares and 35 per cent of the votes. In September 1993, it
bought Westpac's 8.9 per cent stake for Pounds 2m, though the 12 per cent of
the votes could not be utilised until either Dobson made a general offer or
Longwall was floated.
Dobson reduced its dividend payments when Longwall was set up as the joint
venture had no cash flow, being laden with borrowings dating from the mbo.
Dobson is assuming the borrowings, which, at November 18, stood at Pounds
23.5m. Indeed Mr Kaye said Dobson wanted Longwall 'to score' by refinancing
it 'in a plc-type way'.
Dobson is offering Pounds 18.4m in cash with an alternative comprising an
initial cash payment of Pounds 16.4m and a performance-related payment of up
to Pounds 11.6m, linked to profit and cash generated over three years.
Mr Kaye said that Longwall's management, holding 25.8 per cent of the shares
and 41.6 per cent of the voting rights had accepted and opted for the
performance related alternative. That enables Dobson to speak for 84.7 per
cent of the shares and 88.5 per cent of the voting rights.
Group operating profits fell to Pounds 5.78m (Pounds 6.58m), though the
associates - Longwall and Instem - contributed a further Pounds 4.79m
(Pounds 2.95m).
The industrial electronics side lifted pre-interest profits to Pounds 4.72m
(Pounds 3.95m); mining equipment rose to Pounds 5.01m (Pounds 4.48m); toys
and plastics advanced to Pounds 1.63m (Pounds 1.38m); and a property sale
brought in Pounds 448,000 (Pounds 39,000).

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Record revenues behind 43% leap at Daily
Mail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail and the Evening
Standard, produced record revenues and trading profits despite the newspaper
price cutting wars.
The performance of its newspapers, with both Daily Mail and Evening Standard
classified advertising particularly strong, helped the Daily Mail and
General Trust to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 92.1m in the year to October 2 -
a 43 per cent rise on the previous Pounds 64.4m.
Trading profit increased 18 per cent to Pounds 97.6m. The pre-tax result was
after exceptional losses of Pounds 16.1m for provisions set against
investments in the Whittle partnerships in the US, but included a Pounds
15.9m surplus from Euromoney's Pounds 23.1m placing of shares to
institutions in May. Although DMGT sold no shares, its Euromoney stake fell
from 74.7 per cent to 70.3 per cent.
Earnings per share were 58.9p (46.8p). The company recommended a final
dividend of 12.5p (adjusted 11.2p) making a total of 16.5p (adjusted 14.8p).
Mr Peter Williams, finance director, said yesterday that DMGT was delighted
by the performance of the main group newspapers. 'It's almost a surprise to
ourselves.'
Advertising revenue rose by 14 per cent and there was also a 'sharp increase
in profit' at Northcliffe Newspapers, the regional group.
The board, led by Lord Rothermere, did, however, warn that while the group's
UK businesses continued to experience improving advertising markets, the
national newspaper sales market continued to be very competitive and a sharp
increase in newsprint prices was expected.
Mr David Forster, media analyst at Smith New Court, the stockbrokers, said
DMGT had produced 'a really rather good set of results'. Smith New Court was
now looking for profits of Pounds 103m and 62.3p earnings in the current
year and Pounds 124m profits and 75.8p earnings in 1995-96.
Other ventures such as Channel One, the London News Channel and Collegeview,
a US-based information service for college leavers, remained in loss because
of start-up costs.
Associates such as Teletext, Westcountry, the ITV company, the GWR
commercial radio group and the Bristol Evening Post all had improved
results.
The purchase of the Nottingham Evening Post is due to be completed in
January.
DMGT A shares slipped 2p to 978p.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: ICI sells Teesside plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imperial Chemical Industries confirmed yesterday that it is to sell its
ethylene oxide derivatives businesses to Union Carbide, the US chemicals
group.
Under the Pounds 40m deal, Union Carbide will acquire and operate ICI's
ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol production plant at Wilton, on Teesside.
The 90 employees will transfer to Union Carbide.
The deal, signed early yesterday, is subject to review by the Office of Fair
Trading, but is expected to be completed within three months.
ICI was keen to stress the differences between this latest divestment and
its 1993 swap deal with Du Pont. Du Pont has since angered the Teesside
community, and embarrassed ICI, by announcing heavy job losses at the nylon
plants which it acquired there.
Mr Arthur Dicken, ICI's Teesside operations manager, said: 'There are two
big differences, the mutual dependence to supply each other and the very
firm plans to invest.'
Under the agreement ICI will supply Union Carbide with ethylene for the
Wilton site, and buy 45 per cent of its output of ethylene oxide, a key raw
material for a number of its businesses.
The two companies have agreed to fund jointly the expansion of the ethylene
oxide unit at Wilton from 240,000 tonnes a year capacity to 300,000 tonnes.
Union Carbide also intends to increase Wilton's ethylene glycol capacity
from 85,000 to 200,000 tonnes a year and may expand other facilities.
Mr Mike Brider, Teesside district secretary of the Transport and General
Workers' Union, said the unions would seek assurances that Union Carbide
would maintain union recognition and ICI employment terms and conditions.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals propel Alvis ahead to Pounds
5.83m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exceptional profits of Pounds 2.52m helped Alvis, the defence contractor,
lift pre-tax profits by 15 per cent in the year to September 30.
The upturn from Pounds 5.07m to Pounds 5.83m was achieved despite an 18 per
cent fall in turnover to Pounds 80m (Pounds 97.3m), resulting from weak
order books in several subsidiaries.
The sale of Alvis's 11.2 per cent stake in Avimo Singapore, coupled with the
disposal of Alvis UAV Engines, resulted in exceptional gains of Pounds
4.23m. However, the group also took a charge of Pounds 1.7m for redundancy
and restructuring costs.
Operating profit from continuing operations dropped from Pounds 5m to Pounds
43,000 on sales 31 per cent lower at Pounds 67.1m.
Profits at Alvis Industries fell from Pounds 1.89m to Pounds 1.28m, after
losses at Alvis Vehicles and Alvis Aerospace and Transmissions.
Mr Nick Prest, chief executive, said: 'We are reasonably confident that
Alvis Vehicles will get some substantial orders this year, which is very
important for the profitability of the group.'
Unipower, the manufacturer of specialist military vehicles acquired in
February, did not make a substantial contribution to profitability, but is
expected to next year. The goodwill write-off from the acquisition is Pounds
3m higher than was then expected at Pounds 9.42m.
Avimo Singapore's contribution to profits fell from Pounds 6.57m to Pounds
3.26m because of poor results at its Asian operations. Avimo Alvis
Aerospace, which makes castings and mechanical components, incurred a
substantial loss.
Helio, the maker of periscopes and equipment for fighting vehicles, and Arab
International Optronics both performed well.
Earnings per share emerged at 2.5p (2.4p) and an unchanged final dividend of
0.5p is proposed maintaining the total for the year at 1p.
The shares closed down 1p at 41p.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: M&amp;G rises 20% despite difficult markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
M&amp;G Group, the independent unit trust company that stresses the importance
of high dividends, yesterday lifted its total pay-out for the year by 20 per
cent to 30p, matching the rise in earnings.
The board is recommending a final dividend of 17p (15p), to be paid from
earnings of 57.5p (47.8p) per share.
Pre-tax profits for the year ended September rose by 20 per cent from Pounds
50.9m to Pounds 61m. Funds under management grew by nearly 12 per cent to
Pounds 11.8bn (Pounds 10.6bn) - a record net inflow.
'We are extremely pleased with 20 per cent growth,' said Mr David Watson,
finance director, given that the markets had been difficult. The FT-SE-A
All-Share Index at the end of September was at an almost identical level to
the previous year.
Over five to 10 years 94 per cent of the group's unit trusts were in the
first and second quartile. 'We continue to offer above average investment
performance,' said Mr Watson. 'We treasure this highly.'
Unit trust sales more than doubled to Pounds 899m (Pounds 414m) and net of
redemptions jumped from Pounds 27m to Pounds 527m. The group's share of the
market for unit trust Pep sales grew from 9.1 per cent to 10.2 per cent,
helped by the removal of the initial charge on the Managed Income Fund Pep
in January.
Single premium life sales were 81 per cent higher at Pounds 237m (Pounds
131m). From January sellers of life insurance will have to disclose the cost
of management fees, and overall sales are expected to dip. But Mr Watson
said M&amp;G was well placed to win extra business as it was among the lowest
charging companies.
Net asset value per share rose from 196.5p to 216.3p. The shares rose by 3p
yesterday, closing at 940p.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Trafalgar House cuts charges - Lower
provision of Pounds 24m for further rationalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar House, the engineering and property conglomerate, has returned to
profit after three years of losses, helped by a sharp fall in provisions and
the cost cutting carried out since Hongkong Land took effective control last
year.
About 2,000 jobs have been cut from the engineering division in the past
year, reducing costs by about Pounds 30m.
Yesterday the group announced a further Pounds 24m of provisions for
additional rationalisation and redundancies. These will fall mainly in the
engineering division in the UK and Europe.
Engineering profits fell to Pounds 43.7m (Pounds 77.2m) on turnover of
Pounds 2.23bn (Pounds 2.25bn) in the year to September 30. Group operating
profits before exceptionals rose to Pounds 93.6m (Pounds 91.1m).
Mr Nigel Rich, chief executive, said engineering margins had continued to
fall as the division worked through contracts won during the recession. He
warned engineering profits could fall further this year before margins
recovered. The order book had remained fairly constant at about Pounds 2bn.
'There has been a pick up in the steel industry and petrochemicals and we
are getting a lot more work coming out of Asia.'
After total exceptional debits of Pounds 24.1m, Trafalgar recorded a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 45.6m. A debit of Pounds 396.7m in the previous year
resulted in a loss of Pounds 347m.
Mr Gavin Launder, conglomerates analyst at Goldman Sachs, described the
results as 'quite encouraging' but left his current year forecast unchanged
at Pounds 99m. He reduced his earnings per share forecast from 4.5p to 4p.
A sharply reduced interest bill of Pounds 23.9m (Pounds 41.4m) followed the
Pounds 400m convertible share issue a year ago, which left Trafalgar with
gearing of just 3 per cent at its year end on shareholders' funds of Pounds
708.6m.
Operating profits from construction were little changed at Pounds 13.1m
(Pounds 12.5m) and there was a strong recovery in housebuilding, where
profits jumped to Pounds 19m (Pounds 6.1m).
Analysts were encouraged by the Pounds 500,000 underlying profit from
commercial property - compared with a Pounds 15.4m loss - but the company
said the flat contribution of Pounds 7.8m from shipping was disappointing.
The mass of exceptional items included property write-backs of Pounds 5.8m -
after write-downs of Pounds 178m the previous year - and a Pounds 15m
provision for environmental risks related to a site in the US.
Earnings per share were 1.1p (47.6p loss) and Trafalgar is paying a final
dividend of 1p, after passing the interim, as predicted a year ago.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Plysu declines to Pounds 2.85m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plysu, the plastic container manufacturer, expects to pay at least an
unchanged dividend this year, despite the adverse effect which sharply
higher raw material prices will have on profits.
Mr David O'Shaughnessy, chairman, who was announcing a 16 per cent fall in
interim profits, said progress in cutting costs and increasing volumes had
been overshadowed by rises in polymer prices of more than 75 per cent. This
represented cost increases of Pounds 1.5m a month across all of Plysu's
businesses.
The full effect of the increases would be felt in the second half. However,
Mr O'Shaughnessy said Plysu would be able to pass through all the price
increases, although that would take time.
The drop in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 3.41m to Pounds 2.85m, for the six
months to September 30 was on sales 2 per cent higher at Pounds 44.7m.
Mr O'Shaughnessy said profits were lower because of both the impact of
higher raw material prices and the negotiation of longer-term contracts with
the dairy companies.
However, with the restructuring announced last year about Pounds 1m in
annualised costs had been cut out of the UK containers business, and Pounds
750,000 from the continental European operation. The underlying trading
position was also improving, he said, with volumes in the juice and dairy
containers business at record levels.
Plysu maintained the interim dividend at 2p. Earnings per share fell from
4.8p to 4p.

2.66m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold Greenlees Trott, the advertising and marketing services group, reported
pre-tax profits up 19 per cent from Pounds 2.24m to Pounds 2.66m in the six
months to October 31.
Turnover increased 13 per cent from Pounds 127.8m to Pounds 143.8m and group
revenue grew 9 per cent from Pounds 25.8m to Pounds 28m. Operating profits
rose by 11 per cent to Pounds 3.16m.
Earnings per share were up from 6.2p to 7.16p. The interim dividend is 2p
(3.3p) with the balance of interim and final adjusted to reflect the group's
previous practice.
Net interest costs fell by 18 per cent to Pounds 507,000, reflecting reduced
long-term borrowings.
The results represented the best overall performance for some time, said Mr
Michael Greenlees, chairman. This was largely achieved as a result of
improvements in UK oper-ations, in particular of GGT Direct and GGT
Advertising.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Improved beer sales volumes help Greene
King to Pounds 10.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greene King yesterday announced its first improvement in beer sales volume
in three years as it reported a 12 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits
from Pounds 9.49m to Pounds 10.7m. Turnover rose from a restated Pounds
72.8m to Pounds 77.5m.
Most of the growth came from managed pubs, which sold 16 per cent more beer,
partly reflecting additional houses purchased from Bass. Their sales and
operating profits rose by 19 per cent. Volumes sold to the free trade and
national accounts dipped slightly, leaving overall volume up 0.2 per cent at
410,000 barrels.
The second half had started well with beer volumes and food and drink from
managed pubs showing further growth, said Mr Timothy Bridge, chief
executive. Consumer confidence remained fragile, however, particularly in
East Anglia, the group's home market.
Underlying profits growth was 8 per cent, excluding reorganisation costs of
Pounds 1.02m (Pounds 336,000) and a Pounds 763,000 gain on disposal of
investments, mostly the profit on the sale of the 29 per cent stake in
Morland, the Thames Valley brewer.
The Pounds 29m proceeds helped cut net debt from Pounds 100.6m to Pounds
69.2m and gearing from 43 per cent to 28 per cent.
Greene King continues to look for new pub sites in densely populated areas,
typically to the south and south-east of its home base. It hopes to open
about seven new pubs this year; so far it has opened one in Crawley and one
in Oxford.
The interim dividend is 4.1p, up 6.5 per cent. Earnings per share were 19p
(16.1p) before exceptionals and 17.2p (16.4p) after.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Devanha, the cable television company, is coming to market by reversing into
Worth Investment Trust, which has made a Pounds 24m recommended bid for the
company.
The offer takes the form of 24.628468 new shares in Worth, with one warrant
for every five shares, for each Devanha ordinary share. The Pounds 24m
valuation is based on the 20.5p asset value of existing Worth shares, with a
2p premium. Worth shares were suspended yesterday at 24p.
The new shares will represent 79 per cent of the share capital of the
enlarged company, to be named Caledonian Media Communications.
Marshall Securities is to place 20.5m of the new shares, 17.5 per cent of
the total. Directors and shareholders in Devanha have given irrevocable
undertakings to accept the offer in respect of 90.8 per cent of the shares.
The proposals will be put to an extraordinary meeting on January 9. Dealings
in the new shares and warrants are due to start on January 10.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Chrysalis considers options on distribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chrysalis, the music and media group, is considering the possibility of
joining a consortium bidding for the Channel 5 franchise or launching a
channel for cable or satellite television.
'Channel 5 is not the only method of distribution,' said Mr Chris Wright,
chairman of Chrysalis, which will make 3,000 hours of television this year.
The company, which yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.39m for
the year to August 31 on turnover from continuing operations up from Pounds
59m to Pounds 68.9m, has not yet decided which option to choose. However, it
is keen to keep its status as an independent producer.
The pre-tax loss of Pounds 14.6m the previous year included a provision of
Pounds 11.1m against losses on the closure of discontinued businesses such
as the MAM Leisure amusement machine operation. The 1994 results reflect a
credit of Pounds 1.5m released from the provision.
Losses per share were 11.06p (34.44p).
Mr Wright, a significant shareholder in Chrysalis, said that 'excellent
progress' had been made in refocusing the company on the multi-media
entertainment industry.
'As anticipated, the extensive investment that this has necessitated has
impacted on short-term profitability but I am confident that our long-term
goal of a substantial enhancement of shareholder value will be achieved.'
Chrysalis has decided not to pay a dividend for the year and it is clear
that the start-up costs of Crystal FM, the new commercial radio licence for
London won against intense competition, is likely to be enough to keep the
company in loss in the current financial year.
Chrysalis, and probably its shareholders, will expect the company to move
into profit in 1995-96. At present shareholders' funds stand at Pounds 45m.
The shares closed unchanged at 245p.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Sweb dismisses merger speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Western Electricity dismissed speculation that it could become
involved in a merger or takeover as it reported a 35 per cent increase in
interim pre-tax profits and a 24 per cent dividend rise.
Mr John Seed, chief executive, said there had been no noticeable changes in
its shareholders' register. 'We are not in discussions with anyone and it is
our intention to remain independent,' he said.
As one of the smaller regional electricity companies, Sweb has been
identified by investors as one of the most likely bid targets after Northern
Electric. Trafalgar House announced this week that it was considering a bid
for Northern.
In the six months to September 30, Sweb made pre-tax profits of Pounds 41.4m
(Pounds 30.6m) on turnover of Pounds 374.1m (Pounds 385.8m). The interim
dividend of 8.7p (7p) is being paid from earnings of 25.6p (19.9p).
Sweb said the underlying increase in the dividend was 18.6 per cent but the
amount per share had increased further by the buy-back of 5.1 per cent of
its shares.
Sweb has authority to buy back up to 10 per cent and Mr Seed said the
company would choose an appropriate moment to complete the programme.
If it did so, gearing by the year-end would be about 20 per cent, assuming
no other significant changes.
Distribution unit sales increased by 2.6 per cent on a weather-adjusted
basis, helping to increase profits from Pounds 26.6m to Pounds 36.7m. The
supply business incurred a loss of Pounds 2.5m against a profit of Pounds
3.2m in the comparable period.
Mr Seed said Sweb aimed to cut Pounds 27m from the cost basis over the next
five years, with most of the reductions in the first two. About Pounds 18m
of this would come from improving operation efficiency. Electricity business
staff is scheduled to fall from 2,900 to 2,400 by the end of the century.
Retailing halved its loss to Pounds 500,000. Mr Seed said that if the
company could 'find an opportunity to make an elegant exit from retailing we
would take it'.
Sweb intends to demerge its full holding in the National Grid if flotation
goes ahead.
COMMENT
There were two schools of thought on Sweb in the City yesterday. Some
analysts argue that it is a good bet because it enjoyed a favourable
regulatory review; others see it as being in danger of being penalised by
investors for moving too slowly on cost-cutting, particularly jobs. But in
these heady days evaluation of electricity companies has as much to do with
the likelihood of them becoming bid targets as with their underlying
performance. That is why Sweb's rating is higher than most. Its shares are
trading on a yield of 4.2 per cent, assuming a 29p full-year dividend.

<TEXT>
Kunick, the leisure group which floated its UK nursing homes business
earlier this year, is to pay its first dividend for three years after
announcing an 86 per cent increase in annual profits.
The proposed dividend is 0.5p. Turnover for the 53 weeks to September 30 was
flat at Pounds 95.2m (Pounds 94.1m) but pre-tax profits jumped to Pounds
8.98m (Pounds 4.84m). Earnings per share, after exceptional items, were
0.82p (0.13p).
Operating profit on continuing operations was up 28 per cent at Pounds 7.66m
(Pounds 6m).
The leisure division increased operating profit by 27 per cent to Pounds
5.65m (Pounds 4.43m) after an efficiency programme at Bell Fruit Services
and the successful introduction of AWP machines, which issue prizes such as
watches. Four new entertainment centres for the 18-30 age group will be
opened in 1995.

FT  16 DEC 94 / SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley: Warburg is left in the lurch
 -The problems that dogged the proposed merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse of the merger talks between Morgan Stanley and SG Warburg is an
unfortunate Christmas present for both sides. It questions not only whether
they should have foreseen the obstacles, but whether Warburg can recover its
poise as an independent investment bank.
In the aftermath of yesterday's statements, some Warburg employees
questioned whether senior executives, including Lord Cairns, its chief
executive, should resign. Yet whether they stay or go, Warburg will find it
harder than before to maintain the argument for its independence.
The collapse of the talks was sudden, and happened after Mercury Asset
Management's board and some of its senior fund managers started to digest
the implications of the deal. Fund managers were concerned to protect their
independence, while directors wanted to ensure shareholders were not
disadvantaged.
MAM's board, led by Mr Hugh Stevenson, its chairman, brought in Lazard
Brothers, the merchant bank, to advise on the deal after it was made public.
The most obvious question was how MAM's minority shareholders - who own the
25 per cent of its equity not held by Warburg - would be treated.
The problem was that the merger offer appeared to value Warburg's equity
below its market price, implying that MAM was not being fairly valued. Mr
Philip Gibbs, analyst at BZW, estimates that at Dollars 60 per Morgan
Stanley share, the implied valuation of Warburg was Pounds 1.53bn, or 695p
per share.
This was well below yesterday's opening price of 798p. Mr Gibbs says that
applying a price earnings ratio to MAM similar to other US fund management
acquisitions, and giving a premium for Warburg's investment banking
business, a takeover bid ought to value the group at 950p per share.
Such calculations made MAM call for what it yesterday termed 'an appropriate
offer' for minority shareholders, so giving them a chance to exit at what
seemed a fairer price.
Although Morgan Stanley did not want to pay too much, its executives were
prepared to accept some premium.
One senior Morgan Stanley executive says that gaining control of MAM was
'the principal attraction' of the merger because the US firm wanted to gain
a stabilising influence on its earnings. The merger gave it a chance to
acquire MAM at a lower price than it would pay for a US fund management
business.
Morgan Stanley executives believe the gap between the premium MAM wanted to
pay to minority shareholders, and its own suggestion, was bridgeable. 'We
were perfectly prepared to recognise that retiring it (the minority stake)
would have resulted in a premium,' says one.
But another problem was dogging the proposed merger of MAM and Morgan
Stanley's fund management arm. MAM fund managers who were told of the merger
last week wanted to keep independence from Morgan Stanley's operations. This
became the main point at issue at a meeting in London on Tuesday.
'It turned out we had a different view. We believed that the businesses
could be brought together over time - it wasn't a case of jamming them
together next week,' says one senior Morgan Stanley executive. The US firm
thought that unless the operations were brought together - for example in
technology and marketing - the point of the merger was lost.
The negotiations ran into other problems, and while Warburg executives do
not believe these were likely to be insuperable, they could have been big
enough to block a deal - even without the asset management complications.
One difficulty was that the two investment banks were having problems
deciding how businesses would be run. Although senior executives had an
outline view before the deal was made public, there was still some tough
bargaining to be done among more junior managers over who would have
control.
Both banks are adamant that there were no 'black holes' discovered in the
due diligence process that made either bank nervous about linking with the
other. Indeed, some Warburg executives claim they were reassured by the view
Morgan Stanley took of the strengths of their business.
The collapse of the deal leaves questions facing both banks, given their
rhetoric about the reason for linking together. If they will no longer be
able to combine to form the strongest global investment bank, how seriously
can they claim to be global players if they now remain independent?
The questions are loudest for Warburg, whose shareholders would have taken a
third of the equity in the new holding company. The bank was seen to have
tacitly admitted that it could not achieve global scale by itself, and had
failed to penetrate the US securities market seriously.
Warburg's executives were yesterday arguing that this was a logical fallacy.
They believed that they would have achieved a leap of five years in their
strategy through the merger. They now think that they can simply resume
their previous strategy of independent growth, accepting slower expansion.
Yet this reasoning did not cut much ice yesterday within Warburg's London
offices yesterday, where the collapse led to an angry inquest. 'I think the
merger was driven by two things: panic by people on the board who don't
understand this business, and greed,' said one Warburg employee.
Some Warburg employees said the handling of the deal had exposed weaknesses
in the bank's management. 'There's a lack of confidence in the people in top
management,' said the same executive. One problem is seen as the detachment
of Sir David Scholey, chairman, from day-to-day management.
Whether or not it can pacify its employees, the bank may have difficultly
persuading its shareholders and analysts to accept a resumption of the old
strategy. This appears to be what they will attempt, with executives arguing
that only Morgan Stanley was an appropriate merger opportunity.
The most obvious alternative would be a merger with another 'bulge bracket'
firm from New York such as Goldman Sachs or Merrill Lynch. Yet Warburg
executives believe that Goldman's more hard-driving and aggressive culture
would not match its own, and neither's businesses would fit its own.
But bids from other banks remain possible, especially given the attention
Warburg has drawn to its own valuation. Some potential acquirers yesterday
played down the chance of an immediate bid, although they said it might
become more attractive if Warburg was further weakened.
One rival said delay might be the best strategy. 'If I wait a week or two it
might get worse,' he said. He also argued that it would become easier to
take business from Warburg on the argument that 'a bank that handles its own
business so badly should not be advising anyone else'.
A further difficulty for Warburg is that the circumstances under which the
merger collapsed draws attention to divisions between it and MAM.
The fund management firm drew attention to its independence this year when
it penalised Warburg over its parent's handling of Enterprise Oil's bid for
Lasmo. The obstacles thrown by MAM in the way of the merger can hardly
improve relations between the two companies, although Warburg executives
insist that MAM's independence is vital to its success, and the value of its
75 per cent stake. Yet the embarrassment could provoke it to try to take MAM
back into full ownership. For Morgan Stanley, questions over the future
appear less pressing.
The firm's executives implied that buying MAM at a discount to the price
seen in US acquisitions was the main attraction of the merger. Morgan
Stanley has already built a larger European operation than Warburg's US arm.
Even so, the merger's collapse brings back questions for Morgan Stanley.
With strong capital and ambitions, it has built up a reasonable presence in
Europe, but it still has a long way to go, and it will now have to grow
organically. Its failure to gain control of MAM may also prompt it to search
for another fund management acquisition.
Probably the most bewildered participants in the entire week-long drama will
be the other investment banks and brokers of the City of London. After
Warburg's announcement last week, many reflected on how long they could last
under independent ownership, and without integrating.
The Warburg-Morgan Stanley incident has demonstrated once again that mergers
in the volatile and often temperamental world of investment banking are
easier dreamed up than achieved. If the fundamentals of the market have not
changed, rivals may at least resolve to take their time.
In the wider world of global investment banking, rivals may be relieved that
a strong global force is not created at a single stroke. Yet the fact that
two firms were prepared even to consider such a bold move shows how high the
stakes are becoming in the battle to build truly global firms.

FT  16 DEC 94 / SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley: The old guard marches on -
The mood at Warburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse of talks came just as Warburg employees were beginning to come
to terms with the merger and even, some of them, relish the broader horizons
it would open up.
'Personally I am disappointed. What was being offered here was a brave new
world,' said one employee. He said that the chance of a more dynamic future
outweighed the threat of job cuts, at least for younger staff. But staff say
the company is 'split down the middle'. One spoke of the existence of an old
guard who 'do not have much to gain from this and have much to lose. They
will be able to prolong the status quo,' he said.
Some New York staff and Eurobond traders, the Warburg employees most exposed
to rationalisation, have been given a stay of execution and will also be
relieved.
There is a general recognition nevertheless that the collapse of merger
talks is not the end of the story. Either another buyer, or Warburg itself,
will force job cuts.
When or how has become even more uncertain than it was a week ago,
contributing to the sense of insecurity at Warburg.
'We now have to go through a period where we worry about whether there will
be another bid. We are in limbo,' said one bond specialist.
Bewilderment has sometimes turned to anger. 'We have been led up the garden
path and then shoved back out again,' said one employee.
Faith in management has been seriously shaken. Cynics at Warburg are
betting, not on markets, but on the future of Lord Cairns, the chief
executive, after what one described as 'the bizarre course' of the abortive
merger talks.

FT  16 DEC 94 / SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley: Back to the drawing board -
What now for Morgan Stanley?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An opportunistic move to pick up a leading UK fund management company on the
cheap? Or part of a broader strategic move to outflank other US investment
banks on the international stage?
Whatever the real motivation behind Morgan Stanley's interest in SG Warburg,
the collapse of the proposed deal raises questions about its international
aspirations.
Morgan Stanley remains a relative minnow in asset management, though bigger
than Wall Street rivals such as Goldman Sachs or Salomon.
The bank has set a high priority on building this business further: in the
increasingly capital-intensive and volatile investment banking business it
remains a relatively stable source of fee income, says Mr Richard Fisher,
chairman.
Morgan Stanley executives yesterday ruled out buying another UK merchant
bank - but, notably, did not rule out buying another asset management firm
outside the US.
Meanwhile, in the broader business of investment banking - raising capital
for companies and others, distributing and trading securities and advising
on mergers and acquisitions - Morgan already has highly developed
international operations. Two out of five employees are based overseas, with
700 in Tokyo, 400 in Hong Kong and nearly 2,000 in London.
Gaps remain: in equities research in Asia, for instance, or in its
relationships with UK companies and equities distribution in Europe. Morgan
executives say these weaknesses can be met by growing its existing business,
rather than buying a competitor.
Revenues from outside the US, largely from trading and corporate advisory
work, are already stronger than most other US investment banks.
In 1993, thanks to a good year in Europe's bond markets, Morgan Stanley made
pre-tax income of Dollars 720m (Pounds 439m) in the region - 60 per cent of
its worldwide income, and far more than the Pounds 179m reported by Warburg.
'The profitability of our operations outside the US, as measured either by
return on capital, or profit per professional, has been at least as big as
in the US,' says Mr Phil Duff, Morgan's chief financial officer.
The US and European bond markets have been volatile this year. But Mr Fisher
says: 'We have made the decision to fund the growth through this difficult
period.' Staff growth outside the US bears this out this year: numbers have
grown by 15 per cent, at a time when US investment banks generally have been
shrinking.
If, however, financial markets remain weak for long, then those investments
seem certain to be scaled back.

FT  16 DEC 94 / SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley: Subtle shift in the
relationship - Warburg and MAM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When SG Warburg sold off a quarter of its holding in Mercury Asset
Management in 1986, it was trying to make a point.
Not only did it want to reap some of the value of its fast-growing fund
management arm, it wished to underscore the independence of MAM. At a time
when too many questions were being asked about dealings between the fund
management and stock brokerage arms of merchant banks, independence seemed
like a good message to send to the public.
Warburg has underlined the message by siting its headquarters in Finsbury
Avenue in the City of London and those of MAM just on the edge near London
Bridge.
Now, officials at Warburg may well be wondering whether MAM has become a
little too independent. With a potentially valuable merger between Warburg
and US investment bank Morgan Stanley thwarted by the independence of MAM
directors, the relationship between the two firms may be permanently
altered.
'MAM have always seen themselves as very independent of Warburg. Not only
for regulatory reasons but because their business in character is very
different from that of Warburg,' said a fund manager at a rival firm. 'At
the level of the MAM board, they will not welcome losing their
independence.'
Neither Warburg nor MAM would comment on suggestions that the Morgan Stanley
deal has badly strained relations between the two. 'There are relationships
here which go back 20 years,' one MAM insider said.
But the head of a rival fund management firm argues that 'there must be some
bad blood between those two buildings'.
'There are bound to be a few recriminations,' adds Mr Philip Gibbs,
securities industry analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
And, industry experts say, MAM may well emerge with the upper hand. Over the
past seven years, MAM has consistently accounted for the lion's share of
Warburg's earnings, Mr Gibbs notes. Any effort by Warburg to force MAM
directors to toe the line could encourage the departure of some of its
leading lights - thus undermining MAM's value. Within Warburg, MAM has its
own board and executive committee, and considerable autonomy in setting its
own strategy and expansion. Its executive committee reports to the Warburg
board, of which its chairman, Mr Hugh Stevenson, is a member.
MAM has periodically asserted its independence in ways that have proven
embarrassing to Warburg. For instance, MAM directors were so irritated at
the way Warburg handled the purchase of shares in oil company Lasmo, for
which the bank's client, Enterprise, was making a hostile bid, that it cut
its dealing with Warburg's brokerage arm for several weeks.
MAM and Warburg are now both expected to mull the contentious issue of
whether the minority stake in the fund management company ought to be
purchased by Warburg. One objective would be to ensure that MAM cannot
thwart a marriage should another suitor emerge.
Alternatively, some analysts suggest that Warburg may wish to sell its MAM
holding and re-invest the capital in its investment banking business.

industry's price review, writes Roland Adburgham. The move is likely to
result in redundancies of about 10 per cent among its workforce of 600. The
industry regulator has set the company's K factor, which determines by how
much prices can rise above inflation, at 1 per cent for each of the next
five years. 'To ensure at least the matching of the efficiency criteria
underlying the determination, it will be necessary to take a number of
actions including a major internal restructuring programme,' said Sir John
Wills, chairman. The company reported a 15 per cent rise in pre-tax profits
to Pounds 4.73m (Pounds 4.12m) for the six months to September 30, helped by
a Pounds 700,000 profit from the sale of non-operational properties. The
interim dividend is 12p (11.1p); earnings per share were 49.2p (44.5p) basic
and 45.3p (39.9p) fully diluted. Turnover rose 4 per cent to Pounds 31.3m.
Operating profits were Pounds 6.55m (Pounds 6.4m), after a Pounds 1.1m
provision for costs of reorganising and reducing staff levels.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Asda claims victory in superstore price wars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asda yesterday claimed success for its strategy of returning to its roots as
a low-priced superstore, as it outstripped profit forecasts and reported
underlying sales increases well ahead of its rivals.
However, Mr Archie Norman, chief executive, warned that the 'watershed era'
of intense competition and falling margins in grocery retailing was likely
to continue for another two years.
The UK's fourth largest grocery retailer announced a 47 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits for the 28 weeks to November 12 from Pounds 74m to Pounds
108.7m - against City forecasts of Pounds 97m-Pounds 106m.
Profits last year were depressed by Pounds 14.4m losses at Allied Maples,
the furniture and carpet subsidiary sold to Carpetland last December,
flattering the latest results. Core Asda chain's operating profits, however,
increased 17 per cent from Pounds 95.1m to Pounds 111.5m.
Asda also announced plans to open its first 24-hour superstore increasing
the stakes in the battle for Christmas trade. The store in Clapham, London,
will be open all hours on December 22 and 23.
Mr Norman, who was the first industry figure to warn that the 'halcyon days'
of food retailing were over, disputed claims by rivals J. Sainsbury, Tesco
and Argyll that the fall in industry gross margins in the past year was a
one-off 'step change'.
'I don't know how they can say that with a straight face,' he said. 'This
(step change) was supposed to have happened a year ago, but gross margins
have continued to decline in the last four months.'
He said pressure on margins would persist as long as growth in industry
selling space outstripped demand growth.
Tougher government planning restrictions, were likely to reduce the number
of new superstores opened in 1996-97, so the level of excess capacity would
fall.
'The tightening of planning is the best thing that has happened to the
industry,' Mr Norman said.
Yesterday's figures demonstrated a further strong recovery in the fortunes
of Asda, whose future looked in doubt in 1991 when it had debts of Pounds
1bn. The group has paid off borrowings which stood at Pounds 82.7m last
April, and has net cash of Pounds 19.8m.
Asda is nearing the end of a three-year recovery programme designed to
transform it from a clone of Sainsbury or Safeway into a store catering for
'ordinary working people and their families, who demand value'.
But Mr Norman countered analysts' fears that growth would now slow, saying
there was still scope for raising the performance of Asda's stores.
The store refurbishment programme would continue and new information
technology would be introduced. Asda planned to increase the turnover of its
clothing range and develop its leisure range.
Total sales increased 8.4 per cent to Pounds 2.66bn. Like-for-like sales,
which exclude new stores, increased 7.1 per cent - well ahead of Asda's
bigger rivals.
Asda attributed the sales increase to improved customer service product
quality, and lower prices - resulting in a fall in gross margins of half a
percentage point. The operating margin increased from 3.9 per cent to 4.2
per cent.
The interim dividend increased from 0.55p to 0.61p, with earnings per share
up from 1.79p to 2.62p.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Government plays for time on rec bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government said yesterday it would retain its 'golden' shares in the
regional electricity companies until March 31 1995, making impossible the
completion of a potential takeover by Trafalgar House, the conglomerate, of
Northern Electric before then.
The statement was viewed in the City as a stalling tactic while ministers
considered the political implications of a bid. It strengthened the view of
some analysts that a bid might be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission. 'The government may be unwilling to make the final decision on
such a politically sensitive takeover itself,' said one.
Trafalgar House said yesterday that any offer would not be financed by
another rights issue. It is thought that Northern shareholders would be
offered high-yielding convertible shares with a cash alternative
underwritten by Hongkong Land, Trafalgar's 25 per cent shareholder.
Trafalgar shares added 1 1/2 p to 73 1/2 p yesterday after it announced
better-than-expected full-year figures. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 45.6m
compared with a loss of Pounds 347m in 1992-93.
Northern Electric is thought to have turned down a request to meet Trafalgar
board members because the potential predator has made no formal proposals.
Trafalgar announced on Wednesday it was considering a bid. Northern
yesterday requested an inquiry into the recent sharp rises in its shares.
The Stock Exchange said it was already 'carrying out inquiries into the
circumstances surrounding trading in the shares'.
Shares in Northern fell 26p yesterday to 980p yesterday, but most of the
other 11 regional electricity companies (recs) rose further. The highest
rises were at Midlands Electricity, up 32p to 834p, and East Midland
Electricity, 29p higher at 795p.
The political sensitivity of the possible bid was underlined when Mr Martin
O'Neill, Labour energy spokesman, said Trafalgar was attracted to Northern
because of a slack regulatory regime enjoyed by recs. He called for any bid
to be referred. 'The MMC should be laying down ground rules for the future
ownership of the recs once the government's special share has expired.'
Trafalgar House is still thought likely to go ahead with a bid. Although it
has not ruled out launching an offer this year, the likelihood is that it
will wait until January.
Mr John Deane, finance director of Southern Electric, who suggested earlier
this week that his company would consider mergers with other recs, yesterday
ruled out bidding for Northern. 'We would not want to get into a competitive
bid,' he said.
Speaking about Trafalgar's results, Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said: 'Much
progress has been made and the company is well on the way to achieving a
framework of strong central financial discipline combined with delegated
operational authority.' He said that Trafalgar was committed to developing
'a portfolio of investments in infrastructure projects'.
It is thought Trafalgar will argue that a takeover of Northern would provide
it with the cashflow and additional skills to take advantage of the growth
of design, build and operate schemes in Asia.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Swiss Re and CS Holding strengthen business links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Swiss Reinsurance, the world's second largest reinsurance group, is to take
a 20 per cent stake in the derivatives arm of CS Holding, the financial
services group built around Credit Suisse.
Swiss Re will buy the holding in Credit Suisse Financial Products, the CS
subsidiary that is a world leader in financial derivative products, in a
cash and shares deal.
The companies did not disclose details of the CSFP transaction, but as part
of the consideration, CS Holding will raise its stake in Swiss Re from 5 per
cent to 9 per cent.
At yesterday's SFr794 closing price of a Swiss Re registered share, a 4 per
cent stake was worth SFr1.3bn (Pounds 630m).
Credit Suisse and CS First Boston, which each own 50 per cent of CSFP, will
see their capital stakes reduced to 40 per cent each.
Credit Suisse, however, will retain a 56 per cent voting stake, thereby
ensuring that its balance sheet backs up CSFP activities.
CSFP has capital and retained earnings of slightly less than Dollars 1bn.
Last year, its net income totalled SFr444m, and CS has said it has continued
to perform very strongly this year.
Swiss Re and CS also announced a strategic alliance in financial and
reinsurance products.
The two are launching a Dollars 200m (Pounds 122m) insurance investment fund
aimed at fledgling reinsurance companies, mainly in Asia and eastern Europe,
and two other joint ventures.
A second joint venture will be formed between Swiss Re and Credit Suisse, to
develop products for their common clients.
A third, between Swiss Re and CSFP, would develop and market derivatives on
reinsurance products.
This is the second major strategic move at Swiss Re in the past few months.
In September, it sold off its direct insurance interests for some SFr5.3bn.
Mr Lukas Muhlemann, a management consultant who joined the group as chief
executive in August, said the group had decided to concentrate on its core
reinsurance business.
Swiss Re said it felt that the application of financial derivatives to risk
management in reinsurance was a strategic area of the future.
'We feel we have to be in it,' the company said.
CS said it was finding that reinsurance was becoming an element in more and
more of its business deals and saw the alliance with Swiss Re as an
opportunity to develop new products.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Swissair in Belgian talks to gain stake in Sabena
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A radical change in the ownership of Sabena, the Belgian national carrier,
was on the cards last night as Swissair, Switzerland's national airline,
confirmed it was in discussions with the Belgian government.
In a move that would provide Swissair with a secure foothold in the European
Union's single aviation market, the airline's board of directors said it had
asked the executive management to take steps towards closer ties with
Sabena.
The board also stipulated the terms and conditions on which such a
relationship would depend, but would not confirm reports that it was aiming
for a 49 per cent stake in the Belgian carrier. 'These matters are currently
the subject of promising discussions between the two companies,' Swissair
said yesterday.
It now looks likely that Air France's 25 per cent interest in the Belgian
airline will be bought, either by the Belgian government or Swissair,
clearing the way for a deal to go ahead. Air France owns two-thirds of
Finacta, a Belgian holding company which has a 37.5 per cent stake in
Sabena. The Belgian state owns 51 per cent of Sabena.
Although the French carrier is thought to be reluctant to end its links with
Sabena, it has come under heavy pressure from the Belgian government to do
so, and is understood to be ready to discuss terms under which it would sell
its stake.
Mr Elio di Rupo, the Belgian communications minister, said negotiations
would start 'very soon'. The Sabena board meets today, and an announcement
could follow as early as next week.
In a letter to personnel, Mr Pierre Godfroid, the Sabena chairman said:
'Swissair wishes to acquire a significant shareholding in Sabena's capital
with a view to strengthening our shareholders' equity.'
Switzerland's main airline is desperate to find a base inside the EU so it
can take advantage of the deregulated single aviation market. It is also
worried that Switzerland's continued determination to remain outside the
Union has resulted in unfavourable treatment at key European hubs.
'Swissair feels a bit out in the cold,' said Mr Quentin Quarterman, an
analyst at Smith New Court. 'It finds it difficult to get new European
destination slots, especially in Italy.'
Pressure to find an entry into the EU increased after the collapse last year
of the so-called Alcazar plan to merge Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,
Scandinavian Airlines System and Austrian Airlines.
Sabena, which last year made losses of BFr4.5bn (Pounds 89m), has meanwhile

FT  16 DEC 94 / Counties reprieved in Banham reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most English counties will survive under reforms announced yesterday by Sir
John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission, reversing plans to
abolish them.
Sir John described the reorganisation of local government as a 'gamble', and
said there was no evidence that authorities created by the restructuring
would improve services.
The changes he announced would cost up to Pounds 90m to implement and
additional administrative costs of up to Pounds 35m.
Only Berkshire and Dorset, of the 18 counties for which he announced
proposals yesterday, will be abolished. That brings the total of counties to
be replaced with unitary councils - which combine the powers of district and
county councils - to eight.
Sir John has already announced that a further 26 county councils will
continue in their present two-tier form, and is expected to confirm next
month that the remaining five will also maintain the two-tier system.
In September last year, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, said he
wanted two tiers to continue only in 'exceptional' circumstances.
However, Rutland and Herefordshire have regained their independence as
unitary authorities, having lost it in the last review in 1974. In total,
yesterday's proposals call for 20 unitary authorities to be created, with a
combined annual revenue expenditure of about Pounds 10bn and a total
workforce of about 250,000.
Sir John predicted that Rutland residents would face extra annual
administrative costs of Pounds 100 a head, but he described public support
as 'overwhelming'. Mr Alan Duncan, Rutland's Conservative MP, said local
people were 'jubilant'.
Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow environment secretary, claimed the review was
'becoming more and more chaotic and inconsistent'.

FT  16 DEC 94 / British Gas drops high street advice and payment services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas is to withdraw all consumer advice and complaints services from
its high street showrooms next month as part of the transformation of its
network into a purely retail operation.
The company has agreed to trade union requests to station security guards at
some shops because of fears that the withdrawal of services might anger some
customers.
A trial of the new-style showrooms in nine cities has resulted in threats by
some customers to employees, according to British Gas officials.
At present, consumers can use gas showrooms to pay bills, inquire about
services, make complaints or receive energy efficiency advice.
But from January 3 the shops will be converted to wholly retail appliance
outlets. The advice and complaint services will be available by telephone
for the price of a local call.
Customers who want to pay their bills in person will be directed to post
offices or encouraged to pay by bank transfer.
Ofgas, the industry regulator, said it was satisfied with the alternative
arrangements. It regards the post office scheme, introduced this year, as
particularly effective, as gas bills can be paid at any of 19,000 post
offices, compared with only 266 gas showrooms.
Meanwhile, the series of public-relations pitfalls that has beset British
Gas in recent weeks continued when MPs and consumer groups criticised the
company for trying to impose deep pay cuts on showroom workers only weeks
after Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive, was awarded a 75 per
cent pay rise.
The House of Commons employment committee said it wants Mr Brown to testify
at a hearing into the issue of executive pay next month.
Yesterday's furore concerned the retail division, which this year was made a
separate business unit as part of British Gas's restructuring. The number of
showroom workers is to fall from 3,300 to 1,300 by 1996.
The division's managers say they have inherited pay scales and working terms
and conditions that are inappropriate to the retail sector.
Mr Bill Adamson, sales director, said showroom staff were paid about 15 per
cent more than their counterparts in similar shops, and terms and working
conditions were more generous.
Pay talks were continuing, he said, and no action would be taken until the
middle of next year.

FT  16 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Siemens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is encouraging that Siemens is predicting a 20 per cent increase in net
profits in the current year, but this does not mean a revolution in the
group's poor competitive position. The expected turnaround at the ailing
Siemens Nixdorf information technology subsidiary is one factor: recovery
here is welcome, but long overdue and Siemens should have bitten the bullet
and pulled out of this business years ago. Another factor is likely to be
reduced spending on rationalisation, which absorbed DM2.7bn (Pounds 1.1bn)
in the last financial year. This was far more than its net profits of
DM1.65bn, and yet the headcount has dropped by a modest 21,000 out of a
total workforce of 382,000 people.
This year Siemens is likely to cut 12,000 jobs, but it should be doing more
to cut costs. The message is underscored by the publication yesterday of the
first segmental breakdown of operating profits. The table showed that
telecommunications accounted for more than half the group's non-financial
profits. That is more than expected and reveals heavy dependence on a market
vulnerable to price pressures in the run-up to Deutsche Telekom's
privatisation. Analysts meeting the company in Munich today should press
hard on how it intends to deal with the challenge, if not through further
cost-cutting.

FT  16 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Asda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Asda's shares have outperformed the market by 34 per cent so far this year,
the best performance of any FTSE 100 stock after British Steel and GKN, and
better than all the food retailers except Morrison. Yesterday's sparkling
figures show why.
Asda is enjoying a renaissance which has brought it back from the brink.
Like-for-like sales growth rose 7.1 per cent in the first half, far better
than other superstores and a considerable achievement in a competitive
market. The performance reflects a full-scale revamp of the stores'
offering, as well as price cutting. The latter led to a 0.5 per cent fall in
gross margins, significantly worse than at competitors such as J. Sainsbury
or Tesco. However this was more than offset by a combination of greater
productivity and increased sales volumes. The result is that operating
profits at the Asda stores rose at more than twice the rate of sales growth.
The muted market reaction to yesterday's numbers reflects some disquiet
about Asda's falling depreciation charge. But the real issue is whether Asda
is becoming just another well-run food retailer, rather than a recovery
story. Its three year restructuring programme comes to an ends next summer.
Thereafter earnings growth will slow. In the meantime, investors'
preferences are likely to shift to the dull performers in the sector, for
example J. Sainsbury.

FT  16 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar House
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar House got off to a good start in the inevitable battle with
Northern Electric over which boasts the better management. Admittedly, it
was never going to be difficult to improve on Trafalgar's Pounds 427m losses
achieved in the previous two years. Performance for 1994 also benefited from
last year's Pounds 195m of property write-downs. That boosted profits from
housing and property sales, and also enabled Pounds 20m of write-backs.
Nevertheless, the new management from Hongkong Land deserves credit for
improving efficiency within the core businesses. The engineering division
was always a world leader with stable revenues throughout the recession, but
management controls had vanished. Under the new regime, engineering costs
fell by Pounds 30m last year, following 2,000 redundancies. Performance may
have been hit by a Pounds 22m restructuring charge and tight margins as
Trafalgar works through an order book built during the recession. But the
engineering division is now highly geared towards recovery.
This year, group profits will rise rapidly as exceptional losses fall. But
there is a danger that this could be eclipsed by its interest in Northern.
Steady but boring utility earnings would dilute the impact of an
engineering-led recovery. Moreover, even if a bid for Northern does not
proceed, Hongkong Land has signalled it wants to put more money into an
enlarged Trafalgar. That may reduce the opportunity for earnings growth.
Investors should be wary.

FT  16 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Warburg wounded
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The failure of SG Warburg's merger talks with Morgan Stanley leaves the
former wounded. Warburg has signalled its need for a partner with strong US
securities distribution to achieve its ambition of becoming a global
investment bank. It may put on a brave face and say it can still pursue this
goal using its own resources. But it will be hard to convince shareholders,
customers and employees that it is possible or sensible to do so -
particularly with Morgan Stanley indicating that it considered Mercury Asset
Management rather than Warburg the crown jewel in any merger.
The snag is that Warburg has come so far down this road that it will be hard
to turn back. The concept of a global investment bank may be valid, given
the internationalisation of capital markets. But Warburg has invested much
money pursuing this goal without generating appropriate dividends. It has
accumulated a cost base attuned to its global ambitions but not the revenues
to match.
One alternative would be to abandon its global ambitions and retrench as a
niche operator. But this would require big restructuring charges, as well as
the management eating a large humble pie. Another alternative would be for
Warburg to sell itself to a larger commercial or investment bank. There
would be no shortage of suitors. The opportunity to buy a merchant bank with
Warburg's franchise rarely occurs. But a cash sale would not appeal to the
management and a hostile bid is unlikely.
Morgan Stanley comes out of the saga looking greedy. It hoped to acquire MAM
without paying its minority shareholders an appropriate premium. Warburg
looks naive in allowing Morgan Stanley to hold the belief that it could get
away with this.
Warburg's board is now under pressure to prove itself. It must restore
morale among its workforce while controlling its costs. It will also need to
demonstrate to shareholders that pouring more money into the global strategy
is a wise use of their funds.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Curtain rises on the final act: The Italian prime minister's
position is becoming more perilous, as financial and political pressures
grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like the flow of lava spilling from a volcano, the accumulated errors of
eight months' government are overwhelming Silvio Berlusconi and his
rightwing coalition.
Following Mr Berlusconi's interrogation on Tuesday by Milan anti-corruption
magistrates, the government headed by Europe's first media
magnate-turned-politician could fall before Christmas. The exact timing will
be determined by the final passage of next year's budget through parliament.
But while the government looks certain to resign, no clear alternative has
yet emerged.
'We are in fact one step away from a 'general crisis': that breaking point
where the confused state of Italian democracy could precipitate a collapse
of the entire system,' warned Mr Ezio Mauro, the editor of La Stampa
newspaper, owned by the Agnelli family.
Tempers are running high in parliament, where verbal abuse has become more
aggressive as the world has been divided into friends and foes of the
government. Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League, has
turned from coalition partner into the prime minister's greatest adversary.
Mr Berlusconi is lashing out ever more desperately at his perceived enemies
 -Mr Bossi, the Milan magistrates, the communist-dominated left and even his
former fellow businessmen. Increasingly, 57-year-old Mr Berlusconi presents
himself as the victim, behaving like a latter-day King Lear cast loose in a
storm; a man 'more sinned against than sinning'.
'We are building up to a storm of unheard-of violence: one of those epic,
homeric storms,' observed Mr Giuliano Ferrara, minister for parliamentary
affairs and the government's spokesman.
The elements of the storm can be divided into the external and internal
pressures.
The principal external pressure comes from the financial markets. With
Italy's debt now more than 125 per cent of gross domestic product, the
country is enormously vulnerable to speculation against the lira.
The lira is already at an historic low, close to L1,050 to the D-Mark. Since
Mr Berlusconi took office in May, it has depreciated more than 8 per cent
against the D-Mark. The Italian risk factor is also reflected in the 4
percentage point differential between Italy's and Germany's interest rates.
The authorities might be forced to raise interest rates to defend the
currency; that would further increase the public sector deficit, which is
already 10 per cent of GDP. As a rule of thumb, each percentage point rise
in interest rates adds an extra L15,000bn in a full year to the Treasury's
budget.
Italy's political uncertainty has added to the doubts in the markets, with
fears that the government's programme for reducing the deficit in the 1995
budget will fail.
The budget was never more than the minimum necessary - it would have held
the deficit to L138,000bn, equivalent to 8 per cent of GDP. Now that aim has
been seriously weakened by the decision to remove pension reform from the
package of measures to head off a general strike planned for December 2.
Pensions are the single largest current spending item in the budget, and the
postponement of reform until next June will create a further six months of
uncertainty.
Even without the removal of the measures to cut the cost of pensions, the
budget targets would have been missed. The deficit reduction has been
undermined by a combination of higher than expected payments on Italy's huge
stock of debt, lower Treasury receipts this year, the cost of paying for
damage caused by November's disastrous floods in the north and the need to
provide funds for pension arrears after an expensive constitutional court
decision on the subject.
Mr Lamberto Dini, the Treasury minister, admitted this week that the budget
is effectively out of date and additional measures would be needed early
next year. Experts believe that a gap of at least L25,000bn will have to be
bridged, almost certainly by raising taxes, which Mr Berlusconi pledged not
to do in his election campaign.
The continued weakness of Italy's public finances at a time of political
turmoil means a rise in interest rates cannot be excluded. The prospect of
the damaging consequences of a fresh rate rise could determine the nature
and length of the impending political show-down.
All parties are agreed the budget must be approved rapidly, no matter how
imperfect its measures. Otherwise the lira, already under pressure in the
financial markets, could come under renewed attack.
'Once the budget is approved, Berlusconi should resign,' observed Mr Massimo
D'Alema, opposition leader and head of the former communist Party of the
Democratic Left. 'I have to accept that the government no longer exists.'
If the external pressures are financial, the internal ones are political.
First there is the increasingly anomalous position of Mr Berlusconi, who is
under investigation for corruption while running Fininvest, his business
group which is Italy's second biggest private company. He is alleged to have
known about the payment of bribes to members of the Guardia di Finanza, the
financial police, to ensure favourable inspections of the group's books.
Mr Berlusconi has rebutted the charges with vigour: 'Everything is based on
the presumption of knowledge of operational arrangements (in Fininvest
companies) which I never dealt with and could never have done, given the
well-known size of the group,' he commented combatively after his
interrogation by the magistrates.
He has also made clear his determination not to resign. 'It is my firm
intention not to back away from the task confided on me by the majority of
Italians in the mandate from the March 27 elections.'
This sense of a popular mandate is deeply imbued in Mr Berlusconi and feeds
his conviction that he can appeal directly to the electorate through
television, over the head of parliament. His ability to drum up support in
this way should not be underestimated since RAI, the state broadcasting
organisation, is now run by his supporters, and his three commercial
channels account for more than 85 per cent of the private television market.
But resorting to the media to survive merely focuses the spotlight on
another of the anomalies surrounding Mr Berlusconi, the conflict of interest
between his role as prime minister and his ownership of Fininvest. He has
been unable - or unwilling - to distance himself from Fininvest since he
took office.
Rather than improving, the situation becomes more entangled the longer he
governs. For instance, it is impossible to see how his government could
reform Italy's broadcasting system, where his dominant position has become a
matter of political controversy, without being considered partisan.
And although he is trying to use his position as prime minister to defend
himself against the scrutiny of the magistrates, their investigation relates
to Mr Berlusconi's time as a businessman, not as premier. He has failed to
explain why, as the founder and chief executive of Fininvest, he did not
interest himself in the visits of the Guardia di Finanza, especially in a
group that is structured in a cascade of tax-efficient companies.
Moreover, the case against him remains open for a full six months, dating
from the first warning on November 21 that he was under investigation. The
cloud of suspicion cannot be dispelled quickly.
Meanwhile there is now open war between Mr Berlusconi and the Milan
magistrates. Since October, inspectors of the justice ministry have been
checking on the behaviour of the Milan magistrates.
Mr Berlusconi and Mr Alfredo Biondi, the justice minister, insist they are
trying to ensure that proper judicial practices are being observed. The
magistrates have clearly abused the rights of citizens in interrogations and
in leaking documents to discredit individuals - not least Mr Berlusconi. But
these events are portrayed by the government's opponents as a determined,
self-interested attempt by the government to undermine anti-corruption
investigations.
In the past 10 days the confrontation has forced the resignations of Mr
Antonio Di Pietro, Italy's best-known anti-corruption magistrate, of an
appeals court judge and all 21 inspectors at the justice ministry. The
wounds are now being felt within the judiciary itself as people take sides.
The situation is such that there can be no peace between the Milan
magistrates and the present government. And it is a battle in which each is
seeking to disable the other.
Another equally damaging institutional conflict has raged between the prime
minister and President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro since Mr Berlusconi took office
in May.
The mutual mistrust is every day more apparent. Mr Berlusconi does not
prevent his ministers from raining insults on the president. Nor does he
dissuade them from making dark threats to raise embarrassing questions about
his Christian Democrat past as interior minister.
By failing to reach a modus vivendi with President Scalfaro, Mr Berlusconi
has alienated the figure whose constitutional position allows him to play
the central role in the next stages of the crisis - the formation of a new
government or the dissolution of parliament. The hostility between the prime
minister's office and the presidential palace has passed a point of no
return.
A similar point has been reached in Mr Berlusconi's relations with Mr Bossi.
The League leader has long been playing the opposition within the rightwing
coalition. This week he voted against the government for the first time and
has effectively changed sides. Mr Bossi has never felt comfortable in the
same alliance as the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco
Fini.
But there has been a far greater contradiction at the heart of the
coalition. Mr Bossi has never had an interest in anything but the short-term
success of the Berlusconi government. The League is a lesser partner in the
coalition, and Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement was instrumental in
providing backing to elect the bulk of Mr Bossi's deputies. A durable
government could submerge the identity of the League in that of its larger
partner.
By threatening to break the alliance, Mr Bossi has retained the League's
identity. But this tactic cannot be maintained throughout the life of a
legislature, and Mr Bossi's threats to leave the government once the budget
is approved look likely to come to pass.
The present government can be brought down only in parliament, but the
League's defection to the opposition would provide the necessary numbers to
bring this about. Until now the League has hesitated because Mr Bossi fears
early elections and has failed to secure an alternative alliance. But Mr
Bossi has now pushed himself into a position where he cannot draw back.
Mr Berlusconi is the only political leader to favour early elections, with
the reluctant endorsement of his chief ally, Mr Fini. However, President
Scalfaro is likely to explore other options first, if only because the
electoral laws need to be changed to remedy the faults of the reformed
system first used this year.
There is also a strong practical objection to early elections, since this
would entail at least three months of uncertainty during the preparation and
campaign - the most alarming scenario for the financial markets.
One alternative would be a restyled version of the present government. It
would be headed by Mr Berlusconi but be less reliant on the MSI/National
Alliance and would have links to the centre parties that are guardians of
the Christian Democrat heritage. The League might accept this formula; and
significantly Mr Berlusconi's Channel 5 ran a telephone vote on Wednesday
that showed 50 per cent in favour.
But the idea suffers from being linked to the figure of Mr Berlusconi, whose
position is clouded by the judicial investigation into his affairs. No other
leader could easily hold this type of coalition together, not least because
Forza Italia remains little more than a Berlusconi supporters' club.
This leaves various forms of a broad-based government of national unity as
the most stable option. Such a government would have the limited and clearly
defined task of tackling Italy's public finances and preparing a new
electoral law - not unlike the 1993-94 administration of Mr Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi.
As the showdown approaches, the most optimistic tone has been sounded by Mr
Ferrara, the government's spokesman: 'When venom thickens the air forcing
great storms to break, this cleans the atmosphere.'
Instability may lead to political regeneration. But the Italian political
system, caught between the need for change and the instinct for
self-preservation, is unlikely to produce a clear-cut solution.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Bonn's balance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last spring France and Germany announced with some fanfare plans to
co-ordinate their consecutive presidencies of the European Union - joined, a
few months later, by Spain. Their ideas included turning the main pillars of
the Maastricht treaty into reality - including fleshing out a common foreign
and defence policy and founding Europol, a police force to co-ordinate the
cross-border fight against crime.
They wanted to lay the foundations for enlargement of the EU to the east,
balanced by a Mediterranean policy to stabilise the union's southern flank,
a vital French concern. And they wanted to provide a launch-pad for a big
new step towards integration at the inter-governmental conference in 1996.
In the event, progress during the first six months, the German presidency,
has been painfully slow on all fronts. No fewer than 28 meetings held on
Europol - a plan which would be popular with a European electorate worried
about drug-trafficking and organised crime - have produced no decisions at
all.
Common foreign policy is bedevilled by Bosnia. As for eastern enlargement,
the summit in Essen produced a few sign-posts, but little substance.
In the first place, Germany was hopelessly distracted by its own general
election. And once that was over, the looming date of the French
presidential election next spring seems to have paralysed progress. Given
those circumstances, it is scarcely surprising that Germany's handling of
its presidency came in for stiff criticism from the European parliament on
Wednesday.
Bonn was taken to task for a range of problems from vacillation over EU
enlargement to its failure to stem refugee flows from ex-Yugoslavia.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl responded robustly, telling MEPs to do more to
persuade their governments to support German-backed projects like Europol.
Clearly, some hopes for the EU presidency were pitched too high. This may
partly have reflected Mr Kohl's own optimistic forecasts in advance of
Germany's October election. Differences of opinion with France and the EU's
southern members about the pace of eastern enlargement have become
increasingly evident in recent months.
Mr Kohl may have sound domestic reasons for caution about setting firm
timetables for accession by the countries of central and eastern Europe  -
not least the financial sacrifices that early eastern membership would
demand from German taxpayers and farmers.
The EU, too, needs to take seriously the fears of southern states of
negative repercussions from the tilt to the east.
But all 12 current members have explicitly committed themselves to accepting
a further enlargement after Austria, Finland and Sweden join next month. It
is high time that the Union started to focus on the measures it needs to
adopt before such an enlargement can take place, and not simply on the
adjustments required of would-be new members.
Given Germany's concern with eastern Europe, the German presidency should
have been a high point for enlargement hopes to the east. The next three EU
presidencies - of France, Spain and Italy - will inevitably be more
preoccupied with the south, and none has much incentive to press the case of
the easterners. France will also be totally absorbed in its own presidential
elections. The 1996 IGC looks less likely to produce a grand, concerted push
for deeper integration than a continuing muddle.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Avoiding a poll tax on wheels
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Critics of UK rail privatisation characterise it as a 'poll tax on wheels',
a project so unpopular it will have to be abandoned. Recent events give
credence to that verdict. But this need not be the outcome, provided there
is both more experimentation and more careful thought.
This privatisation is running into political buffers. First, a report by
railway experts to the transport select committee warned that inadequate
subsidies could lead to the closure of half the rail network. Second, the
franchising director unveiled his passenger service requirements, which
confirmed fears that services could be cut. Finally, a leaked Department of
Transport memo has revealed Whitehall concerns that the process is advancing
too fast.
These developments have increased the pressure on the government to back
down. This is hardly surprising since public support for rail privatisation
has never been more than lukewarm. One possible response is that no
privatisation was popular initially, but most seem justified in retrospect.
Yet this government is hardly in a good position to persist with an
unpopular policy. Furthermore, there are good reasons even for supporters of
the privatisation to be concerned.
This does not mean that the privatisation is a bad idea. The rail system
does urgently need an injection of private sector management, since British
Rail's performance was notoriously unsatisfactory. It could do with private
sector capital as well, since sufficient public funds will not be
forthcoming. Separating train operations from ownership of the track and
stations appears complicated. But it has parallels in the airline and
shipping industries and is being applied with success abroad. That the idea
is new is hardly a cogent objection.
Closer examination of what is happening shows that many fears are misplaced.
The minimum service requirements will allow train operators to cut services,
but there never was any guarantee of service levels under British Rail. In
any case, it cannot make sense to insist that the present network and
service be maintained in full. The new system will also provide commercial
incentives for operators to run more trains if they are profitable. In
addition, tight controls are proposed on commuter fares, which should
assuage the concerns of these politically influential, captive passengers.
Nevertheless, there is a strong case for proceeding with caution. There are
legitimate worries, for example, about the extent to which tickets will be
available for journeys across the rail system. The prospect that
long-distance tickets will be available only from a 'core' group of main
stations is also a concern.
Yet the really big mistake is to proceed with franchising most of the
inter-city network, and a large part of London's commuter services, in one
go. The first franchises ought to serve as an opportunity for learning, with
the inevitable mistakes avoided in future contracts. Among other things, the
level of subsidies - the indefinite continuation of which is justified by
the failure to charge the social costs of competitive modes of transport -
must be adjusted in the light of experience with the franchises. In
addition, the privatisation of Railtrack, which owns the stations and track,
is being pushed too fast.
If ever there was a case for trial and error, this privatisation is it. The
government must be more cautious. Otherwise, the great train privatisation
will go the way of the poll tax.

Forget Trafalgar House's Nigel Rich or his big boss, Simon Keswick. The man
to watch in the coming battle for Newcastle's Northern Electric is Ian
Robinson, a 52-year-old Geordie who has been running Trafalgar House's
biggest business, its engineering division.
A fortnight ago, he handed in his notice to take up a new job as chief
executive of ScottishPower - which also happens to be very interested in
what happens to Northern Electric. Not only does Robinson know where the
weak spots are in Trafalgar House's brand new top management team - and
there are still a few - but he should also have a pretty good idea of Traf's
game plan for Northern Electric. Hard to imagine an old pro like Lord Hanson
letting such a key player slip away at such a crucial time.

Perfectly understandable if Warburg's Sir David Scholey does not feel like
exchanging Christmas cards with Lazards' vice-chairman John Nelson. Nelson,
one of the City's shrewder merchant bankers, has been making life miserable
for SG Warburg of late. First, he was one of the main reasons why GEC chose
Lazards rather than Warburg in its bid for VSEL, despite the fact that
Scholey is a GEC director.
When there are so few big bids around, it might have helped Warburg impress
Morgan Stanley a bit more if GEC's Lord Weinstock had given it the nod. Now
Warburg's planned get-together with Morgan Stanley has collapsed because
Warburg's Mercury Asset Management subsidiary dug its heels in over the
price. Guess who was advising MAM? Much more of this and Warburg will have
to make a takeover bid for Mr Nelson. Better to have him on the inside etc,
etc.

In the good old days, of course, spooks had no names at all. Even allowing

For Azais, who works at the General Directorate for External Security, has

Joseph Gerard Azais de la Garde de Chambonas.
The genuine aristocracy, needless to say, has no truck with such behaviour.
But commoners may legally adopt aristocratic handles that would otherwise

lolly is going to the greedy operators, and that more of the profits should
be distributed to the arts.
So Vaughan has just submitted to the Treasury a modest invoice for his

not a racing certainty, it has to be said - the monies will be put to good
use in the guise of the Denis Vaughan Orchestral Trust Fund.

Will UN Security Council meetings ever be the same again, now that Sir David
Hannay, the UK's representative, is to step down next July?
Always ready with a crisp warning for Saddam Hussein or (rather less
credibly) to the Bosnian Serbs, the Humphrey Appleby look-alike has rather
become the dominant figure in the council since 1992, when his US colleague
Tom Pickering was exiled to India.
Pickering was replaced by the black but otherwise colourless Ed Perkins,
followed by Clinton confidante Madeleine Albright, for whose inexperience
Hannay felt the need to cover, sometimes in an offensively obvious manner.
But then, subtlety was never Sir David's strong suit.
The typical self-confident Wykehamist, his abrasive bonhomie was given
particularly free rein when he represented Margaret Thatcher's government at
the EC between 1985 and 1990.
Hannay hands over to Sir John Weston, currently Britain's man at Nato.
Briefly political director of the Foreign Office during the Gulf war, Sir
John is credited with having persuaded John Major to intervene on behalf of
the Kurds. Lady Weston had watched what was happening on television, and
gave him no peace until he did something about it. Presumably she will not
be underemployed during her husband's next posting.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Gas cloud
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At the very least, British Gas's plans to cut the wages and holidays of some
of its least-well paid staff is a public relations disaster. The move, just
weeks after the group awarded its chief executive, Mr Cedric Brown, a pay
rise of 75 per cent, also suggests a degree of misjudgement and naivety
within the company's top management that does little to justify exceptional
salaries.
The timing could hardly be more controversial. Gas prices will rise above
inflation next year, and public resentment is running high, as shown by the
government's failure to raise value added tax on heating fuel.
British Gas explains the cuts in wages of its showroom staff - and the
closure this year of 157 of its 423 showrooms - by the need to drag its
retail arm into profit. As part of its modernisation, the cuts may make
sense. The domestic market has matured, and gas is no longer battling
fiercely to win market share. Wages and staffing levels in the showrooms
need to be aligned to the high street, not to British Gas's internal scales.
But the group has been extraordinarily insensitive to public and political
opinion. Even after a decade, the case for privatisation of utilities is
hardly won in the public mind. The popular image of the legacy of
privatisation is not of improved services but of rising water bills - and
now of Mr Brown's Pounds 475,000 pay packet. Yet British Gas cannot afford
to waste goodwill; it wants the Gas Bill now before parliament to spread the
costs of providing universal access across all suppliers.
The group's latest advertising trumpets the flexibility of gas, with the
slogan 'don't you just love being in control?' But its executives may now
find, having turned up the political heat, that they cannot turn it down.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Personal View: Taming the wild beast of derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALFRED STEINHERR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The explosive growth in financial derivatives since the early 1980s has been
one of the most profound structural de-velopments in financial markets since
the organisation of limited-liability equity markets early last century.
Derivatives - financial instruments that derive their value from that of an
underlying asset or index - have added another dimension to business
decision-making. Derivative finance has commoditised the risk of price
changes in many common financial assets, such as equity, fixed income and
foreign exchange.
For example, the risk of losses through exchange rate movements can be
separated from the risk of price movements in foreign assets. A stream of
variable interest rate payments can be converted into fixed rate payments.
The risk of an interest rate rising or falling by more than a set amount can
be bought or sold.
A fundamental economic benefit of this development is that it makes it
easier to quantify the financial risk in any venture and thereby produces
better allocation of resources. However, this happy picture has been marred
by the growing realisation that the new industry has burst upon a
regulatory, supervisory, accounting and legal stage that is not suited to
deal with it.
In particular, the traditional supervisory and regulatory structure for
large banks - the key players in derivative finance - is ill-equipped to
deal with the problem. The existing focus on periodic examinations of
on-balance sheet transactions is inadequate to deal with an environment
where the on- and off-balance sheet positions change so fast that even
end-of-day positions are no longer sufficient measures of an institution's
risk profile.
There is also a fear that markets have become less transparent and more
interconnected, that derivative business is unduly concentrated in a small
group of dealers (some of the big investment banks and securities firms) and
that derivative markets are critically dependent on uninterrupted liquidity
in the markets for the underlying assets. These have given rise to concerns
that problems in the derivatives markets could deal serious shocks to the
financial system.
The regulatory and supervisory response has so far focused on refining
capital requirements, improving supervisory oversight and increasing
disclosure. Although this approach is a step in the right direction, it does
not deal with the basic issue, namely that derivative finance has
fundamentally changed the balance between regulators and financial
institutions in favour of the latter. Instead, emphasis needs to be put on
fostering the growth of a framework for derivative markets that shifts
responsibility for the control and management of risk back into the private
sector.
One of the most notable institutional features of derivative finance is that
it is currently provided by two types of market organisations: the organised
futures exchanges and the providers of over-the-counter derivatives such as
banks. The OTC operators account for about two-thirds of notional values in
outstanding obligations.
What makes this surprising is the similarity between a large proportion of
the contracts sold by each type of organisation. The logical step in
developing a reliable market framework would be to persuade a large part of
the OTC derivative activity to shift into self-regulatory clearing houses or
exchanges - as has happened in other financial markets.
The major advantage of OTC operations is customisation - the products are
tailored for the customer. However, most of the forward exchange and swap
contracts involve little such tailoring. It is estimated that 60-70 per cent
of outstanding OTC contracts could be handled by standardised contracts on
the exchanges.
Many of the leading OTC dealers have taken steps to improve their risk
management. However, risk to the financial system is generated by the weaker
traders and not the best-managed ones. It would be preferable to reduce the
risk through the self-regulation imposed by exchanges, which maximise
liquidity by standardisation.
The importance of derivative markets to the stability of the financial
system suggests that there is a public interest in increasing their
transparency, integrity and liquidity. The playing field should therefore be
tilted away from the OTC markets, which escape relatively lightly under the
present regulatory structure, to induce migration to organised exchanges.
This could be done by increasing capital requirements for banks that take
derivative positions, so that they are as costly as positions taken through
derivative exchanges.
Finally, the increase in transparency would reduce systemic risk. The high
credit ratings of exchanges, their lower transaction costs and higher
liquidity would provide additional impetus to sustained growth in demand of
derivative products by end-users.
The OTC market would retain its important innovatory function, and offer
contracts for which demand is not large enough for exchange trading. But
lower trading costs, economies of scale from liquidity and the low systemic
risk pushed trading in equities - originally also an OTC operation - on to
exchanges. This will also happen for derivatives, and the sooner the better.

FT  16 DEC 94 / When the charm wears thin: Why Maurice Saatchi has angered
some shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cabinet ministers in Her Majesty's government receive flowers from Maurice
Saatchi, paid for by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, every time they change jobs.
The chairman and founder of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi has made a career - and a
personal fortune - out of charming the rich and powerful. Institutions as
diverse as the Conservative party, Mars and British Airways place their
advertising business with the firm, in part because of the personal
relationship between their top people and Mr Saatchi.
However, Mr Saatchi will today have to use all his persuasive powers to
prevent the Saatchi board - which contains such corporate notables as Sir
Peter Walters, former BP chairman, and Sir Paul Girolami, former Glaxo
chairman - from succumbing to shareholder pressure to have him removed.
The company's biggest shareholders, led by Mr David Herro, a 33-year-old
fund manager at the Chicago-based Harris Associates, have warned directors
that, if Mr Saatchi does not stand down at a board meeting today, they will
call an extraordinary meeting to force him out.
Some directors argue that Mr Herro represents only a minority of the group's
owners. But it is a substantial minority. Mr Herro's own fund controls 9.8
per cent of Saatchi's equity. His previous employer, the State of Wisconsin
Investment Board, controls 8.5 per cent and is backing his stand.
Other US funds with him are General Electric Pension Trust, with 6.5 per
cent, Tiger Fund Management, with 2 per cent, and Grantham Mayo, with 3 per
cent.
From the UK, unit trust group M&amp;G - owner of 5.25 per cent - last week
joined Mr Herro in expressing considerable dissatisfaction with Mr Saatchi.
Mr Herro says that a further substantial shareholder has said it can be
counted alongside the dissidents. He believes that more than 40 per cent of
the group's investors are committed to ousting Mr Saatchi, and that a formal
poll would see the odds heavily stacked against his survival.
Carrying out such a poll, during the seven weeks before an extraordinary
meeting could be held, would do great damage to the company - and to morale
 -in a people business. For this reason, Mr Herro is convinced that the
board will 'do the right thing'.
Shareholders' ire has been aroused by several factors. For 10 years after
the company came to the stock market in 1975, investors who backed Mr
Saatchi and his brother made a lot of money. However, the shares have fallen
98 per cent against the market in the nine years since he stepped up from
chief executive to chairman.
His huge ambition - whose extreme manifestation was his never-consummated
plan in 1987 to buy Midland Bank and Hill Samuel merchant bank - was mostly
to blame.
Mr Saatchi was not content with being just an advertiser, albeit the world's
biggest one for a brief period after the 1986 acquisition of the US Ted
Bates agency. In a shopaholic's spending spree, Saatchi bought management
consultancy groups, public relations firms and a range of marketing
businesses, on the bogus theory that companies would want to purchase all
their media and consultancy requirements from a single purveyor.
To finance this expansion, he used the latest financial devices, including
issuing bonds committing the company to a substantial deferred cash payment.
The consequence was a near-disastrous postponement of the true cash cost of
these acquisitions to the turn of the decade - or the middle of possibly the
worst ever advertising recession.
The company escaped collapse only after a painful and complicated financial
reconstruction, which involved raising new money and reorganising the
balance sheet, in 1991.
The group also gained a down-to-earth chief executive, Mr Charles Scott, who
could control costs while Mr Saatchi concentrated on playing the elder
statesman, exploiting his legendary corporate contacts to win new business.
That was the theory until the end of last year, when the Saatchi board took
two actions that infuriated Mr Saatchi, according to his colleagues. On Mr
Scott's advice, the board agreed that the chairman and holding company staff
should vacate their stylish but expensive Mayfair head office - saving more
than Pounds 1m a year - to move in with the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising
subsidiary in London's Fitzrovia.
It was also decided that Mr Saatchi's enigmatic brother Charles - the much
vaunted 'creative' talent of the siblings - should leave the board.
Soon after that, a series of stories began appearing in newspapers about an
alleged feud between Mr Saatchi and Mr Scott, with Mr Saatchi reported to
believe that the 'bean counter' Scott had 'not delivered'.
It later emerged that Mr Saatchi had hired a personal public relations
adviser, Mr David Burnside, the pugnacious former public relations head of
British Airways.
Mr Herro, a supporter of Mr Scott, was outraged. 'My concern about Maurice
started with this extraordinary press campaign,' Mr Herro says. He became
even more furious when he learnt that Mr Saatchi had submitted Mr Burnside's
bill to the company. 'The company has told me it did not pay,' Mr Herro
says.
Meanwhile a debate was raging in the press about why Saatchi was doing worse
than rivals such as WPP. Was it poor operations management (Scott's
responsibility) or failure to win new clients (Maurice's role)?
Peace broke out between Scott and Saatchi in the spring, when the company
said both would stay on. As part of the settlement, Mr Saatchi appeared to
respond to the widespread investor campaign against long contracts for
public company directors. He dropped his five-year rolling contract worth
Pounds 625,000 a year for a three-year fixed-term arrangement, paying Pounds
200,000 annually. The company had become '100 per cent politically correct',
Mr Saatchi said at the time.
But Mr Saatchi's new package did not appear so PC to Mr Herro and other
shareholders when they learnt that a new 'super-option' package was being
negotiated for him, which breached guidelines laid down by the Association
of British Insurers, the fund management lobby group.
The company's remuneration committee, chaired by Sir Peter Walters, offered
Mr Saatchi options worth eight times his old salary of Pounds 625,000, which
would have given him a Pounds 5m profit in three years if the Saatchi share
price reached 300p (compared with 153 1/2 p yesterday).
The views of the company's biggest shareholders were solicited privately.
The unambiguous response from those controlling more than 40 per cent of the
shares was hostile.
Meanwhile, Mr Saatchi found himself isolated from shareholders, company
executives and directors on a different issue, that of whether his surname
should be dropped from the masthead of the holding company.
Many of them feel that like 'Thatcherism' - a brand that Mr Saatchi helped
to create - the 'Saatchi' name has passed its sell-by date for the holding
company, if not for the advertising subsidiary, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Advertising Worldwide.
They feel that the development of subsidiaries such as Bates, which do not
have 'Saatchi' in their brand names, is stifled: when they win a client, the
success is usually described as a 'Saatchi' achievement.
Mr Saatchi, however, has told colleagues that removal of his name from the
holding company masthead would force his resignation.
Whether he has the luxury of choosing to go - rather than being forced out -
he will learn today. A colleague summed up the dilemma facing the board:
'Like Thatcher's colleagues, directors have to decide whether to put their
personal loyalty to him ahead of the good of the company.'

FT  16 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Shareholders must exercise pay power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr EDWARD LEIGH MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The problems surrounding shareholder control of executive salaries were
accurately and extensively reflected in your leader ('Can pay, will pay',
December 6).
I am glad to hear that the government intends to act, as this was an issue
which I addressed in a policy pamphlet which I published on November 28. I
said there that the way forward was to empower shareholders. Two days later
the prime minister told the House of Commons that he was prepared to
consider a similar solution.
In my pamphlet, Responsible Individualism, I wrote that the public is
justifiably suspicious when executives raise each other's salaries in a
round of mutual pocket-lining. Especially since many of them perform roles
more akin to ministers presiding over large bureaucracies than to genuine
entrepreneurs who innovate and create wealth and jobs.
It is indisputable that capitalism and the market are the most effective
systems to generate wealth and improve the material well-being of the
nation. But man cannot live by those alone; a sense of right and justice
must also be part of the equation. Politicians should give a lead.
The issue cannot be dismissed by the simple argument that British companies
must be free to offer world-class salaries. There has been a real public
outrage and that is something companies and government ignore at their
peril. There is an important moral dimension and it is this which has been
missing on recent economic policy. A sense of duty and service on the part
of executives and a sensitivity to the feelings of those on low wages would
not go amiss.
I do not advocate the Labour remedies of intervention and state regulation.
We should empower shareholders - who, after all, own the companies and
employ the managers - to enable checks to be placed on what the public
suspects are unnecessarily large pay packages.
This can be achieved, first, by fiscal measures to encourage direct share
ownership - something lacking at present; and, second, by legislation to
ensure that City institutions take due note of the views of the beneficial
owners of the shares they nominally hold.
I recognise there are difficulties in devising a mechanism by which the
latter could be achieved, but it should be possible to introduce a legal
system, however rough and ready, which would make fund managers respond to
the opinions of the millions of investors whom they represent.
We should trust the people in this respect. The public is bright enough to
know when they need adequately to reward an entrepreneur who boosts their
dividends, asset values and pensions, but jaundiced enough to recognise
blind greed.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: New jobs orthodoxy not reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN SHELDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It was a refreshing change to see a combination of common sense and
healthy scepticism in Richard Donkin's piece on the 'end of jobs for life'
debate ('Don't throw away those gold watches', December 14).
The zealots of the New Right have, until now, managed to create a new
orthodoxy in the reporting of the world of work by mixing in a teaspoonful
of truth with a barrel load of half-baked, politically driven science
fiction.
In this brave new world, everybody is (or will soon be) a tele-worker on
short-term contracts, paid entirely on the basis of some form or other of
performance remuneration with an individualised relationship with the
employer, moving rapidly between different employers and types of jobs, all
requiring different skill mixes. Not only is this paraded as fact, but as
desirable from the point of view of both individual employee and employer.
Away from Star Trek, this is far from the reality, but there is a danger
that it will become reality by default. I have lost count of the number of
times that senior civil servants and ministers have repeated with tedious
regularity that 'the old days with jobs for life have gone for ever' and
then make some reference to the latest headline-grabbing burial of lifetime
employment as though it was justification for this or that cutback or
privatisation.
This represents the real use of the set of anecdotes and impressionistic
observations that masquerades as a theory of trends in working patterns. It
serves as an academic cover for the conscious political decision to attack
conditions of service, particularly in the public sector - and to increase
insecurity at work.
As Richard Donkin's article suggested, as a personnel strategy it is as
damaging to employers as employees. Nothing is inevitable here and one of
our objectives as a trade union is the preservation and further creation of
real, secure employment options.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Imperative to modify ro-ro ships
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir WILLIAM BARLOW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the past few weeks two disasters at sea have warranted front-page
headlines in the press. In the sinking of the ferry Estonia, more than 900
lives were lost; following the fire on the Achille Lauro cruise ship, almost
all of the 1,000 passengers were saved.
The reasons? The roll-on, roll-off (ro-ro) design of the Estonia caused it
to capsize completely in a few minutes with no time for evacuation; the
Achille Lauro remained upright and afloat for many hours, with ample time
for evacuation.
There must be an overriding objective to design new ships or modify existing
ro-ro ships such that, following a significant ingress of water, an
essentially upright position is maintained for at least 30 minutes to make
evacuation practicable. Passengers on ro-ro ships are entitled to expect the
same standards to ensure survival as those which apply to conventional
passenger vessels.
Engineering solutions are available and cost or operational disadvantages
must not be allowed to stand in the way of this entirely logical objective.
The Royal Academy of Engineering is examining the matter and will be
consulting shipowners among others.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to reassure Mr Greg Perry (Letters, December 10/11) that
the European Commission does respect the payment delays suggested for member
states and business in its November 30 recommendation. The average delay for
all payments made by the Commission during the first 11 months of 1994 was
40.5 days, well below the 60 days recommended. Only a few of the
Commission's payments (less than 10 per cent) took longer than 60 days, and
in most cases these delays were the result of irregularities with the
invoices.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Arts: The Little Match Girl - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANA SOUTHWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After his radical adaptation of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray,
the thought of gay provocateur Neil Bartlett interfering with Hans Christian
Andersen's The Little Match Girl at the Lyric Hammersmith might send shivers
down most censorious spines. It is like Fagin leading one of our seasonal
institutions down a dark alley for some forbidden pleasure.
But in Leah Hausman's frothy production, fears of something untoward are
completely unfounded. This is undiluted child's play, aided and abetted by
the show's main attraction: the Britton brothers, Tim and Chris,
collectively known as Forkbeard Fantasy, doubling up as assorted snowmen,
nuns, cops and angels when they descend from heaven in their underwear on a
snow cloud. Their mission? To protect the Little Match Girl from the
yuletide afflictions of poverty and homelessness.
So far so kosher. All Bartlett can really be accused of is shoehorning
Andersen's slight, melancholic and sentimental story of the street urchin
who dies from exposure on New Year's Eve into a contemporary Christmas
musical. Unfortunately his ambition never quite catches fire. What we get is
an evening of sugary anachronisms cheerfully presided over by Terry Neason's
dear, dead old Grandma: an ample-bosomed Scottish matron who has been yanked
from the steps of Mary Poppins' St Paul's, airbrushed and relocated to West
London.
Against the backdrop of Penny Saunders' lurid cartoonscapes, Hammersmith is
turned into a Dickensian theme park. The council house penury of Sian
Reeves' Little Match Girl failing to contend with her grumpy, Sun-reading,
sofa-bound Dad (Steve Fortune) rapidly gives way to joyous cod-Victorian
street bustle when Grandma persuades Miss Match to go out and sell some Swan
Vestas.
Suspiciously mature and vocally shrill, Reeves' raven-haired, emaciated
heroine is a striking street ingenue. But there is too much of the artful
about her to take her plight seriously. 'First The Big Issue, now matches .
. . whatever will they think of next?' snarls Tim Britton's bemused Harrods'
grotesque, Griselda, exiting stage left pursued by a tottering skyscraper of
Christmas presents. Quite. It seems much more likely that Reeves has time
shares in her pocket rather than a handful of lucifers.
The uncomfortable parable, that not everybody is happy at Christmas, is
conveniently lost in the warm flush of Nicolas Bloomfield's tripping
Sondheim and Lionel Bart-sounding arrangements. Each song, like a struck
match, becomes a cue for one of the Match Girl's customised visions. This is
where sentiment and the Britton brothers' diverting pantomime are most
successfully spliced.
The first startling vision is an enormous, cuddly Pooh Bear; but the third
vision is the showstealer: an inspired piece of Alice in Wonderland with the
Brittons as two pieces of giant cutlery - (a sort of Basil Fawlty
knife-and-fork duet).
In this they champion the hurt feelings of an all-singing, all-dancing
Christmas dinner dominated by Steve Fortune's lugubrious giant Turkey,
supported by a three-part harmony of Mashed Potatoes (Liza Sadovy, Lindsey
Dawson and Simon Penman), and finally swamped by a children's chorus of
Brussels Sprouts (pupils from Brackenbury School).
The short second half fails to match this shameless ebullience. The final
fantasy scene, where the Little Match Girl is finally taken into heaven, is
a resistible piece of Bartlett campery with the entire cast conjugating in
Restoration wigs around a haystack posing as a Christmas tree. An 18 carat
piece of cutesiness; but a 22 carat piece of kitsch.
The Little Match Girl is at the Lyric, Hammersmith until January 21.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Let's keep Ashton's flame burning: Clement Crisp argues that
more of the great choreographer's work should be in the repertoire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Remembering Frederick Ashton's ballets - and Covent Garden's second
programme in tribute to him is called Ashton Remembered - is too nostalgic
for my taste. What we must see is Ashton, the man we know from his
choreographies, alive on stage through scrupulous performance. When his
works are well performed, audiences understand the essential Ashton, what he
gave the Royal Ballet, what he wanted classical dancing to look like. Not
memories, but deeds.
The matter of preserving his work and his style (which was the man), seems
to me urgent. The Royal Ballet does not maintain a corpus of Ashton pieces
in repertory - a fault owed to an inadequate allocation of performances -
and I sense that schooling in Ashtonian nuance, vital matters of posture,
precision and clarity of execution, is not always careful. The Royal Ballet
no longer speaks Ashton's poetry as well as it does Forsythe's rap.
There sometimes seems a prettiness, an almost fatal charm, in Ashton
ballets, as with the fairies in The Dream or Cinderella, or the skaters in
Les Patineurs. But the prettiness is not over-sweet, and sustaining every
charming moment is a master's craft. (The scherzo in The Dream is a miracle
of composition matching Mendelssohn's airy genius). Ashton should be second
nature to our dancers, though recent disastrous casting in Symphonic
Variations, with performers so physically unsympathetic to its style that
they dismantled the piece, show how easy it is to destroy his work.
The good things about the Ashton Remembered bill, as I saw it at the week's
end, is that The Dream has been well revived, and Facade has, at last, a
Dago worth watching. The Dream was at its gossamer best. Bruce Sansom is a
commanding Oberon, classically sure. Peter Abbeglen is a delightful, because
innocent, Bottom. The fairy legions are quick-footed, deliciously melting in
pose. The lovers are freshly funny, and touching. Viviana Durante can spin
through Titania's steps with the best, but the role lacks radiance and that
wilful sensuality to illuminate the last duet. Tetsuya Kumakawa is a
technically astonishing Puck - the role has never been more ebulliently
danced - but his interpretation is a Kumakawa flag day. His bravura is
destructive because too emphatic.
Ashtonian fragments make up the centre of the programme. Two pieces have
been rescued from oblivion: the 'Air' pas de deux from Homage to the Queen,
which was the ballet's tribute in Coronation year; and the Raymonda duet
made in 1962 for Beriosova and Donald MacLeary. 'Air' is a lovely thing,
despite its clattering Malcolm Arnold score. After all the years, memories
came back of Fonteyn and Somes effortless and serene in it. It looked less
than serene with the first appearance of Deborah Bull and William Trevitt,
but it will handsomely repay their further study.
Raymonda brought Darcey Bussell to the stage after a long period of injury.
She has the expansive grace and grandeur that the dance needs - if not yet
all the stamina - and it was a delight to see her again, though if the piece
is to persist in repertory the ballerina's pink costume had better be sent
to the nearest Oxfam shop, and something less cute be confected. Zoltan
Solymosi was Bussell's cavalier - and rather cavalier in manner.
The luscious Thais duet - Massenet's swooning violin; an extremely high
sugar-content; the veiled vision of an Alexandrian courtesan; one lingering
kiss: can life offer more? - was done to a turn by Viviana Durante and
Stuart Cassidy. Divinest patchouli-scented hokum. And, unnecessarily, a tiny
Ashtonian sneeze - La chatte metamorphosee en femme - was also remembered.
It does nothing for Ashton's reputation, and not enough for its interpreter,
Maria Galeazzi.
The closing Facade was memorably led by Stephen Jefferies as the Dago. It
was a role made wildly funny by Robert Helpmann, compounded of sinuous wit,
brilliantine, diamond rings and devastated glances. No one, until Jefferies,
has come anywhere near Helpmann's satiric skill. Jefferies plays it deadpan,
and wonderfully so, and misses not one comic trick. He is so good that the
Noche Espanol, in which Helpmann used to saunter about in a maddened
pin-stripe suit, should be restored to the ballet for him. The revival was,
otherwise, decent - though the Popular Song could be more bored and
oh-so-slightly more relaxed. Ashton was properly remembered. Long may the
company remember its duty to him.
Ashton Remembered: Covent Garden on December 17 (mat &amp; eve).

FT  16 DEC 94 / Arts: Delicious French bonbons at the Wigmore Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Nash Ensemble has a well-established association with French music of
the 19th and 20th centuries. The group is celebrating its 30th anniversary
with six concerts of French music from Saint-Saens to Poulenc. Saturday
night's programme was a delicious selection of chocolates.
The choice for gourmands would probably have been Quatre poemes Hindous by
Maurice Delage, one of a small number of Parisian composers you could call
exquisite. Delage's settings are exotic, sharply imagined evocations of
India, scored for voice with a lovingly chosen ensemble of pairs of flutes,
clarinets, an oboe, harp and string quartet. The ample, weighty vocal
quality of the soprano Francoise Pollet seemed well-suited to these
languorous yet colourful pieces.
It was less so in Faure's song cycle La Bonne Chanson, in which a lighter
touch was needed. The version was Faure's own amplified one which adds a
string quintet to the piano - a patchy affair: Faure leaves out the piano
for long periods, then suddenly brings it in only to make the strings seem
superfluous. Faure himself preferred the songs without the strings.
An arrangement of Ravel's Sonatine seemed a second-best substitute for the
piano original, too. The Nash's harpist, Skaila Kanga, had adapted Carlos
Salzedo's arrangement for flute, cello and harp by replacing the cello with
a viola, spreading the interest more evenly. It fell short of redeeming a
lost cause, for all the artistry of Skaila Kanga, flautist Philip Davies and
viola-player Roger Chase.
After two slightly sullied masterpieces, the evening ended with one in its
pristine form. Faure's second Piano Quintet, completed in 1921, is
characteristic of the austerely searching quality of his later years. In
each movement the streamlined consistency of texture is a cover for
provocative, unexpected turns of melody and harmony. The first movement and
slow third movement somehow convey serenity and anguish at the same time.
The scherzo slithers by. The finale is surprisingly brief, as if impatient
for its radiant conclusion. A fascinating work, beautifully played.
On Tuesday evening Francoise Pollet returned to the Wigmore Hall in a
recital of French songs with the baritone Francois Le Roux and pianist Roger
Vignoles. Le Roux was warm but rather tremulous - fine in an untypically
fluttering song by Chausson (Les Papillons) but inclined to chop up Faure's
Le chanson du Pecheur and Chanson's baleful La caravane.
Pollet's voice production was blustery, too, though she sang Falla's
Seguidille with great gusto. The singers joined in Duparc's passionate duet
La fuite, adding Bizet's breezier setting of the same words as an encore.
Oddly they were most impressive when really stretched by the grand, arched
phrases of Berlioz's Les nuits d'ete. Pollet found her best form in the
tragic, statuesque appeals of Absence. The role allotted Vignoles was to
suggest the shimmer of the orchestral version with alarmingly few notes: it
was remarkable how evocative his contribution seemed.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Arts: The Immortal Hour - Music in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's future may lie in Europe, but its cultural heritage still means
far more to Americans than to anyone on the other side of the English
Channel. How else do you explain the enthusiasm with which English music is
championed in the US?
Frank Corsaro and Leonard Slatkin have both gone out of their way to
introduce unusual repertoire to New York. Corsaro, known this side of the
Atlantic for his stagings at Glyndebourne, has a penchant for neglected
British operas. Vaughan Williams's Hugh the Drover and Delius's Fennimore
and Gerda are among his recent credits in the US. He has now produced
Rutland Boughton's The Immortal Hour at the Juilliard Opera Center, of which
he is artistic director.
It would be wrong to suggest the production was a revelation, but it made
the best possible case for an opera which - despite the praise once heaped
on it by Elgar and Bax - today seems irredeemably dated in language and
musical idiom.
Boughton (1878-1960) and his Glastonbury Festival, where The Immortal Hour
was premiered in 1914, are among the more eccentric footnotes to English
musical history. Boughton propagated Celtic mythology, socialism and
communal art. The Immortal Hour was never intended for mass consumption -
and yet a cult of popularity developed around it in the 1920s, when it had
more than 500 performances in London. The last major revival, at Sadler's
Wells in 1953, was a flop.
With its simple, folk-song style, The Immortal Hour taps the mystery and
romance of Celtic legend. That is its appeal. The music amounts to little
more than a handful of undemanding, poorly integrated themes, one of which -
the a capella chorus 'How beautiful they are' - is sometimes heard
independently.
The story, set in a forest, concerns a king who falls in love with the fairy
princess Etain. He dies after she abandons him for Midir, Prince of the
Immortals. There are echoes of Rusalka, Lohengrin, Pelleas. New Grove
describes it as a 'poignant depiction of love's inevitable ending in loss'.
Edward Dent said it was 'one of those rare operas to which an inward
surrender has to be made'.
I failed to make that crucial step, but I could not resist the mesmeric
beauty of the Juilliard production, which tapped the otherworldly,
dream-like quality of the work. Corsaro focused on essentials - poised
acting, visual atmosphere - and paced the drama with unerring skill, using
the auditorium for theatrical processions and for those distant choruses
that are so peculiar to this piece. Stephan Olson's decor consisted of
little more than a raked platform. John Gleason's lighting was exquisite,
exploiting the shady depths of the stage and throwing into relief the soft
colours of Constance Hoffman's medieval costumes.
The cast included one outstanding talent - Jon Villars as Midir. His tenor
has a big, heroic quality which projects effortlessly, while retaining a
lyrical core. The technique is good. With his giant frame, Villars seems
destined for a major career. Peggy Kriha's Etain was properly ethereal, and
there were effective contributions from Brian Nickel as Eochaidh, the tragic
king, and Jamie Offenbach as Dalua, the sinister spirit who manipulates the
drama. Randall Behr conducted the student orchestra with clear commitment.
Slatkin's anglophile sympathies need no introduction here, but it is
reassuring to note that he does not reserve them for British audiences. US
radio stations regularly play his Vaughan Williams recordings, and his Saint
Louis orchestra is a fearless interpreter of contemporary scores, including
Peter Maxwell Davies's Worldes Blis and Nicholas Maw's Odyssey.
Due to an unfortunate programme clash I was forced to choose between Graham
Vick's new Shostakovich production at the Met and Slatkin's performance of
Odyssey at Carnegie Hall. I chose the Met and was amply rewarded - but it is
worth recording the reaction to Maw's orchestral epic, which was receiving
its New York premiere. The hall was well-filled, but there was a steady
exodus throughout the two-hour performance. The New York Times critic said
he was jealous of those who left, and characterised the score as 'a mighty
parliament with no majority'. Newsday described it as an ungainly beast
which 'only a mother could love'.
That probably says more about American conservatism than the inherent merits
of Maw's music, which is scarcely calculated to appeal to minimalists. But
there was unanimous praise for Slatkin and his orchestra, whom I heard the
following evening in Mahler's Third Symphony. Carnegie Hall is halfway
through a two-year Mahler cycle. Slatkin's clean, efficient performance may
have gone down well in Saint Louis, but it did not have the personality
which the occasion demanded in New York. The drama of the first movement was
matter-of-fact; the finale lacked depth and expression. Only the mezzo
soloist, Nancy Maultsby, seemed truly inspired.

There's something tawdry about Friday night's programming, as if those telly
execs had written off most of their viewers to post-work drinks or office
outings. Commuters who make it home by sixish in the misguided hope of
something good on the box can choose between a repeated American sitcom
(C4), a repeated Australian soap (ITV), puppets on BBC2 followed by a
repeated tec series a quarter-century old with the 'cult' label (that is, it
never achieved mass popularity) slapped on it. The news on BBC1 reassures us
that 'The Best Television in the World' still caters for adults at twilight.
So does Sounds of the Sixties (7.15pm BBC2). Try to work out why the Bee
Gees made it big and Procul Harum disappeared. Deploy the video to
circumvent the overlapping Harry Enfield and Chums (9.30pm BBC1) and The
Trial (9pm BBC2). The latter is too slick to contribute to the argument over
televising live court proceedings. Enjoy it, like any other soapish
entertainment set in the city that inspired the story of Jekyll and Hyde.

FT  16 DEC 94 / People: Aitken-Davies signals Railtrack's route
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has picked Richard Aitken-Davies to be director of
Railtrack's privatisation unit. It hopes to float the company, which has
taken over British Rail's tracks, signalling and stations, in the first
three months of 1996 but many questions remain to be answered before the
market can hazard its value.
Crucially, the level of charges it can levy on the train operating companies
has to obtain the Rail Regulator's approval early next year.
Aitken-Davies, 45, the man who will be most closely responsible for steering
Railtrack to a successful flotation, was formerly director of corporate
finance at PowerGen. He was financial controller at the state-owned CEGB
before it was broken up into PowerGen and three other companies in 1989. He
helped create PowerGen's capital structure and orchestrate its flotation. He
believes his experience with PowerGen will stand him in good stead at
Railtrack. 'They are both new companies formed from much larger
organisations with no track record of their own,' he says. 'We will have to
go out and persuade the City to invest.'
Aitken-Davies can claim practical, daily experience of the railway,
commuting from Raynes Park in south west London to Waterloo. He is also a
regular user of BR's InterCity services.
He stepped down from PowerGen in October intending to take a break from
business but the government's decision to bring forward Railtrack's
privatisation required a quick decision. He will join the company full-time
in January.
Aitken-Davies, a former councillor in the London Borough of Merton, devotes
some of his free time to acting as an external examiner in business studies
at Luton University.

British Biotech has replaced Brian Richards as non-executive chairman with
John Raisman, former chairman and chief executive of Shell UK.
The change came about at Richards' suggestion, says Keith McCullagh, chief
executive of British Biotech.
'Brian is an R&amp;D oriented man. Board discussions are increasingly financial
and commercial. As we move towards commercialisation, it is a fitting
change,' he says.
Raisman, 65, retired from Shell in 1985 after 30 years with the company; he
is a non-executive director of Lloyds Bank, and formerly on the board of
Glaxo.
Richards, 62, a co-founder of the company in 1986, remains on the board.

Yorkshire Water yesterday appointed two non-executive directors less than
three months after rejecting smaller shareholders' attempts to elect a
similar candidate to the board.
Yorkshire has appointed Patricia Marsh, 48, (above) and Colin Cooke, 54, to
replace retiring directors, Tom Jackson and David Cramb.
Marsh, former managing director of Ace Coin Equipment, one of the UK's
largest distributors and manufacturers of electronic interactive machines
for the leisure industry, is a former member of the customer services
committee for the water industry regulator's Central region. Her appointment
follows the resistance of Yorkshire management and institutional
shareholders to the nomination of Diana Scott, former chairman of the Ofwat
Yorkshire customer services committee.
At the time, Yorkshire's board argued that Scott, who had the support of a
substantial number of smaller shareholders, did not have the relevant
business experience.
Yorkshire yesterday sought to stress Marsh's business qualifications, citing
her positions as non-executive director at Yorkshire-based Rosebys, the
households and soft furnishings retailer, and chairman of the Birmingham
Children's Hospital.
Cooke, who will join the board in the spring, is chairman of industrial
groups Triplex Lloyd and Fenner, and a non-executive of Ash &amp; Lacy and
British Dredging.

John Toyne, a transport consultant, has been appointed group managing
director of United Carriers which has upset investors by making two profits
warnings in the nine months since it was floated on the stock market.
Toyne, 51, replaces Michael Howe who was sacked last month following the
second profit warning. The first setback was blamed on too few parcels; the
second on too many. The shares - floated at 153p - were unchanged at 83p
yesterday. Alan Binks, who lost his job as chairman but retained the title
of chief executive, admitted at the time that the return to the market had
been 'a right mess'.
Toyne joined Imperial Group in 1965 and has spent over 20 years in
production and personnel management. As chief executive of Lowfield, a
grocery distribution business, he led the management buy-out from Hanson in
1988. Lowfield was acquired by Tibbett &amp; Britten in 1989 and Toyne sat on
the Tibbett board until last year. Most recently he has been operating as a
consultant in the transport sector and advising on a number of management
buy-outs.

John Walmsley, the former finance director at Enterprise Oil, the UK's
largest independent oil explorer, has been appointed chief executive of
Hardy Oil and Gas as from January 1.
He will succeed Peter Elwes, who will become deputy chairman with a
full-time executive role. Elwes, who was Enterprise Oil's first chief
executive, interviewed Walmsley for his first job at Enterprise in 1984. The
two men say their long relationship should ensure a smooth transition.
Elwes has been head of Hardy since 1989, when the company was demerged from
Trafalgar House. He is due to retire in 1996. Walmsley was a director of
Enterprise Oil from 1984 to 1993 and departed several months before
Enterprise made its abortive bid for fellow explorer Lasmo.
His appointment at Hardy ends almost a year of industry speculation about
his future.
Walmsley says there is unlikely to be any big shift in strategy at Hardy; he
intends to follow the philosophy he developed at Enterprise of focusing on
core areas. In recent years the company has used the considerable cash
generated by its extensive North American operations to fund longer-term
projects in the UK sector of the North Sea.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Property: Docklands dreams again - The revival of optimism
in east London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Docklands is a barometer of the wider mood of the property market.
Grand plans for the regeneration of the area to the east of the City of
London - including the massive Canary Wharf development - were the products
of economic over-optimism.
The sudden downturn in the property market left docklands stranded, with its
unsettling mix of very old buildings, very new buildings and derelict sites.
Now the mood is one of cautious optimism. Attention is slowly turning from
damage limitation to future expansion.
This is most apparent in residential housing. The stock of empty homes in
docklands has been sold and a minor development boom is under way.
In business space, the over-building of the late 1980s will take longer to
sort out. Out of a total 13m sq ft of office space in docklands, about 4.5m
sq ft is still vacant - an occupancy rate of just 65 per cent.
Yet the overhang of space is steadily being eroded. More than 1m sq ft of
offices has been let this year, up from 800,000 sq ft in 1993, 332,000 sq ft
in 1992 and 192,000 sq ft in 1991.
Even Canary Wharf, the grandiose monument to the last development boom, is
on the way to being fully let. If negotiations with investment bank Barclays
de Zoete Wedd over 500,000 sq ft are successfully concluded, less than 1m sq
ft of the 4.5m sq ft development will remain unoccupied.
Mr Mike Bignell, head of property development for the London Docklands
Development Corporation, said that there was potential for another 10m sq ft
of office space in docklands, including further phases of Canary Wharf.
While the immediate priority must be to fill vacant space, the next phases
of development are already on the horizon as distant possibilities.
Survey evidence is certainly encouraging for docklands. A poll of central
London office occupiers by Jones Lang Wootton, the surveyors, found that
many companies were again thinking about moving out of the City and West
End, after a lull during the depths of recession.
The motivation was not outright cost, but the desire to rationalise sites
and bring operations under one roof. Favoured destinations were areas within
the immediate orbit of central London - including docklands - which could
offer modern space at prices a shade cheaper than the City or West End.
Against this background, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that
Canary Wharf and the LDDC will be dusting off development plans within a
couple of years.
Sir Peter Levene, chairman and chief executive of Canary Wharf for the past
18 months, recognises that the nature of his task is turning from crisis
management to long-term development.
With piecemeal lettings taking place all the time - this week the Personal
Investment Authority confirmed that it is sub-letting one floor of the
Canada Square tower - the existing buildings are achieving critical mass in
terms of tenants.
'The Jubilee Line extension will be with us by 1998, cutting journey times
into the West End to 15 minutes and linking us with Waterloo and London
Bridge stations. That will fundamentally change perceptions of Canary Wharf
and, in planning terms, is not far away,' commented Sir Peter.
The original design for Canary Wharf envisaged 12m sq ft of office space.
The foundations have already been dug for two further buildings - numbers 17
and 20 Columbus Courtyard - amounting to 340,000 sq ft.
Canary Wharf is also in negotiations which could lead to the development of
its remaining river frontage. The area is currently a temporary car park,
but permission has been granted for 1m sq ft of mixed use residential and
office buildings.
With so much empty space to let, at present the LDDC is confining its
development activity to non-office schemes. But that does not imply any lack
of activity.
In the mainly derelict Royal Docks area at the eastern extremity of
docklands, there are plans for an exhibition centre the size of Earls Court
and Olympia combined, an urban village, a university, science park, commerce
park and retail development.
Plans for the exhibition centre are the most advanced, with the LDDC set to
announce its favoured development partner within the next few weeks. Work is
scheduled to start on the 85-acre site before the end of next year.
Just over the water at West Silvertown, an urban village of up to 1,500
homes will be built by Wimpey, the housebuilder. Work should begin as soon
as the planning process - controlled by the LDDC rather than the local
authority - has been completed.
While the Royal Docks development programme will not add directly to the
stock of office space, it could give docklands critical mass in other
respects which would add to its attractions as a business location.
So what will be the effect on the City and West End if Canary Wharf and the
Isle of Dogs do - finally - establish themselves as London's third business
district?
Sir Peter Levene recognises that rents at Canary Wharf will have to remain
below those charged by the best buildings in core City locations. While the
differential will narrow as Canary Wharf gains credibility and improved
infrastructure, the availability of cheaper space to the east of the City
and West End will present real competition, especially for pre-let
developments.
'It is not safe to assume that docklands is not real competition and that
there will be no further development,' said Mr David Price, head of central
London agency for Hillier Parker, the surveyors. 'Paddington, King's Cross
or Spitafields would be preferred locations for some occupiers but not for
all. And they cannot turn the key on new development as fast as Canary
Wharf.'

FT  16 DEC 94 / Technology: The perfect pair of jeans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The search for the perfect-fitting pair of jeans can turn into a lifetime
crusade for some women, but a new software program is aiming to change that.
A Boston-based company called Custom Clothing Technology has developed a way
of making custom-fitting jeans by computer. The technology is being used in
US stores this month to measure customers for Levi Strauss jeans.
Sales assistants measure women's waist, hips, rise - the distance from the
front waistband, between the legs and up to the back waistband - and inside
leg. The measurements are entered into a computer which identifies a
prototype jean providing the closest match. Each participating store will be
stocked with hundreds of prototypes.
The customer tries on the prototype and after final adjustments the sales
person sends the information by modem to the company's Tennessee factory. A
computerised cutter puts out the pieces, which are then sewn together. Three
weeks later, the customer can pick up the jeans at the store, or have them
mailed. The jeans cost about Dollars 10 (Pounds 6) above the normal price
and will initially be available only at four stores.
But, by the end of January, Levi Strauss plans to offer the product in seven
other stores. Because sales people have to be trained in how to use the
program, however, it may take some time before the product is widely
available.
Sung Park, an ex-IBM software programmer and president of Custom Clothing
Technology, says he developed the program after spending time in Hong Kong,
where he could get a suit tailored in a day.
'I thought, wouldn't it be great if this were available to the mass market
in the US?,' says Park. 'And then I started wondering what the best
applications would be.' Park says he asked his female flatmates which piece
of clothing it was most difficult to find a good fit in, and the answer was
unanimous: jeans.
Park has an exclusive contract with Levi Strauss for tailored jeans, but he
is talking to other companies about custom-made bathing suits and men's
suits.
Levi Strauss says it will expand the product to men's jeans and other styles
for women if the tailoring proves popular.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Technology: Hot synthetics - Clothes manufacturers are
warming to man-made fibres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last decade has seen a revolution in cold-weather apparel, and winter
sports enthusiasts face an enticing but confusing array of synthetic
fabrics.
Choosing a wardrobe for cold-weather sports used to be straightforward.
Skiers, skaters, ice fishermen and ice climbers would pack silk or cotton
long-johns, wool sweaters and down jackets. The main concern was choice of
colour.
These days stores stock clothes made of materials with enigmatic names such
as Thermax, Polartec, Thinsulate and Akwatek. Most of the high-technology
fabrics are derived from polyester, a material formerly associated mainly
with cheap suits. Many consumers have a hard time believing in the new
high-performance polyesters.
'If you had told me five years ago that polyester would be the
state-of-the-art fabric for cold-weather clothes, I would have laughed,'
says James Riley, vice-president of design for Reebok, the sportswear
company, which has recently branched out into cold-weather apparel. 'But the
yarn has become so fine and the level of knitting so advanced that it has
become an incredibly flexible material.'
Polyester is manipulated in various ways to improve insulation. 'A main
focus in the industry has been keeping moisture away from the skin,' says
Catherine Salfino, market editor for DNR, a leading publication of the US
textile sector.
Long underwear is probably the weakest element in the traditional
cold-weather ensemble. Silk and cotton both absorb moisture easily and
although silk retains some of its insulating power when wet, damp cotton
loses nearly all its warming capability.
Early experiments with synthetic long-johns in the 1970s, however, were not
successful. Cold-weather retailers such as Patagonia used the plastic
polymer polypropylene in early high-technology models. The new material's
hydrophobic property kept users dry, but customers complained that their
plastic-derived long-johns melted in the clothes dryer. The fabric also had
an uncanny ability to retain odours.
Synthetic long-johns have come a long way since then. Patagonia now offers a
chemically-altered polyester called Capilene, which has gone through
anti-microbial treatment to help the fabric reject odour.
DuPont has also come up with some important new materials. ThermaStat and
Thermax are light-weight polyester materials that aim to trap air next to
the body while funnelling moisture to the outer layer, where it evaporates.
'These fabrics have a hollow chamber which helps them trap the warm air
close to the body,' says Arun Aneja, research associate with DuPont, 'and
air is a good insulator.'
Aneja says scientists got the idea for the material by studying polar bear
fur. 'Each strand of polar bear fur is hollow, and that gives the bear
incredible insulation.'
Reebok challenges the idea that moisture should be drawn away from the skin
in cold weather. The company is negotiating to make use of a new fabric,
Akwatek, developed by Comfort Technology. Akwatek is a polyester that has
undergone a chemical bath, and Reebok claims the material is equally
effective in cold weather or warm.
'In warm weather, Akwatek draws moisture away from the skin to the outer
layer, where it evaporates,' says Riley. 'But in cold weather, the warm
moisture stays next to the skin.'
Long-john technology may be impressive, but the textile industry hit the
jackpot with polar fleece. Malden Mills was one of the early innovators of
this material, which is now as ubiquitous on US streets as wool sweaters.
Polar fleece is popular because it is lightweight, rejects moisture and
dries quickly. Fleece, which entwines thousands of strands of microfiber
polyester, also feels soft and furry.
In outerwear, scientists still face a formidable competitor in down. 'It is
hard to beat down in terms of warmth-to-weight ratios,' admits Elizabeth
Volkers, brand-manager for the insulation material Thinsulate at 3M. But
once down is wet it offers almost no protection. It is also expensive and
bulky. 'Down jackets give people that Michelin man look,' Volkers says.
Insulating material for outerwear uses the hollow chamber concept.
High-technology fillers are honeycombs of fabric that trap warm air near the
body - one of the main challenges for scientists is to fit the highest
number of chambers in the smallest space. Thinsulate by 3M has emerged as
one of the most popular insulating materials, particularly for cold-weather
gloves and ski pants. Sports enthusiasts are still drawn to down jackets for
their lightweight comfort.
In terms of pure insulation power, fur is also difficult to beat. However,
the material's disadvantages are numerous: it is expensive, heavy and
controversial.
Over the next few years, several new technologies are expected in the
cold-weather apparel market. One of the latest is recycled fibres, which
manufacturers hope will prove popular with environment-conscious consumers.
3M plans to introduce recycled Thinsulate next year and recycled fleece is
already available.
Scientists have set their sights on developing bizarre-sounding miracle
fabrics. 'Technology today is based on passive fabrics, which work by
trapping heat generated by the body,' says Aneja. 'We are working on fabrics
that would harness energy from outside the body, such as visible light and
wind. We are trying to modify the polymer from which the yarn is made so
that it absorbs this energy.'
Aneja is also researching materials that adjust to temperature needs. 'We
would like to have a material that warms you when you are cold, cools you
when you are hot.' The most promising polymers in this area are elastic,
engineered proteins, which adjust to temperatures by creating a
temperature-sensitive biosystem.
Cold-weather clothing has already undergone a significant overhaul in recent
years and more technological change is on the way. The day may soon arrive
when ski holiday suitcases contain wind energy-harnessing jackets and
protein long-johns.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Measuring the speed of traffic flows in towns can be difficult because
vehicles are constantly stopping and starting.
Trafficmaster, a company that provides live traffic information to
motorists, believes it has overcome this problem by devising a system that
uses video cameras and number plate recognition software to track the speed
at which traffic moves through two points on the road.
A video camera photographs the number plates of a batch of cars, which are
digitised and transmitted by radio signal to a site further down the road,
where another camera photographs the targeted number plates.
Trafficmaster plans to install the equipment early next year on two London
routes. The company will destroy the sightings data after its use to protect
drivers' privacy.

An oversized, remodelled golf club could be the answer for golf enthusiasts
who yearn for greater accuracy and distance.
Spalding, a US equipment manufacturer, has designed a driver in which 20 per
cent of the weight of the head has been redistributed to its perimeter and
sole. The head's higher moment of inertia and lower centre of gravity gives
the ball less spin, allowing it to go further. The weight shift also makes
the driver more stable, helping the golfer attain greater accuracy.
The Top-Flite Magna Heat Driver, which is designed for mid-to-high handicap
golfers, will go on sale at the beginning of next year at around Pounds 99.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Toshiba, the Japanese electronics company, has developed an imaging
technique which could make it easier for doctors to examine brain function
abnormalities, such as epilepsy.
The technique is a form of magnetic resonance imaging, which monitors the
electromagnetic radiation given off by excited nuclei in a magnetic field.
The 'double echo' MRI method produces separate images of the neurons and
adjacent blood flows by relying on differences in the fall-off
characteristics of their wave signals. Toshiba believes the accuracy and
speed of the technique will assist doctors with diagnosis, presurgical
mapping and the exploration of complex brain functions.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Management: Keeping afloat - Anglian Water is undergoing a
radical overhaul in its drive for efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE BIRD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Smith, group managing director of Anglian Water (AW), works a 60-hour
week, including most Sundays and some Saturdays. Although he admits he's a
workaholic, he discourages his staff from over-working. 'It's a sign of
inefficiency,' he says.
Eliminating inefficiency has been the prime objective of an especially
controversial management change programme at AW during the past year. It has
involved 10,000 staff interviews, 900 redundancies and the elimination of
multiple layers of management. Some Pounds 60m of last year's Pounds 192.2m
pre-tax profits were set aside to pay for the exercise.
The scale of his task was illustrated this week when Ofwat, the UK water
industry regulator, singled out Anglian in its Levels of Service 1993-94
report as one of four companies 'where performance against one or more
measure falls short of what customers can reasonably expect' (on two of the
four criteria it scored well below average).
Nevertheless, Ofwat's observation that Anglian has 'reported significant
improvements already' will be an encouragement to Smith, who took over the
helm in 1990, the year after flotation. Drastic action has been necessary,
says Smith, because, despite its profitability, the company was still living
with big problems inherited from its public-sector days.
Smith was initially anxious to avoid upheaval but in 1992 he attended the
10-week Advanced Management Programme at the Harvard Business School. One of
the lessons he says he learned was the importance of radical change. 'You
don't create a winning business by nibbling away at the sides,' he says.
'That just leaves you with frayed edges.'
In 1993, he commissioned a study focused on the 2,700 white-collar staff. It
recommended that about one-third of them should go, and that the
hierarchical command-and-control style management should be eradicated in
favour of a flat structure based on coaching and empowerment.
Smith also canvassed his staff for their views on the company's management
style in an employee opinion survey.
The survey results were pretty bruising, he recalls. 'What came across was
an organisation based on bureaucracy, poor internal communications and too
much fear.'
Smith, who had long campaigned for a more open style of management, held a
series of employee presentations on the results of the opinion survey. It
was an embarrassing experience being openly criticised on subjects such as
his Pounds 163,000 salary, but he believes that attending the presentations
was a turning point for many employees. 'Until that moment many of them did
not believe the changes we had been talking about would happen.'
In getting rid of the 900 staff, Smith's main problem was to ensure that the
right people stayed. So instead of keeping only those staff whose jobs
remained, he decided all employees would have to re-apply for positions
under the new order. Part of their appraisal would be an occupational
personality questionnaire, designed to look for abilities that would be
needed by the new AW: conceptual thinking; innovation; team-working;
initiative; people-orientation; and flexibility.
The questionnaire became a focus of resentment among some staff who felt
they had been unfairly deprived of jobs. Some psychologists have also shed
doubts on the validity of the technique, arguing that what people say in
questionnaires may not bear much relationship to how they do their jobs. But
Smith, who also filled in a questionnaire, insists they are valuable as an
indicator of how somebody might be able to adapt to a new culture,
especially managers.
'If you want a brave new world, spending half an hour discussing what
someone has done for the past 10 years doesn't get you far ahead.' In any
case, the questionnaires were only part of the appraisal process, he says.
Another lesson he learned at Harvard was the role of Total Quality
Management. 'I knew it was important before I went, but I came away
understanding that it meant far more than I had realised.' One way that
Smith put this theory into practice was by upgrading the status of staff
working on water mains and sewers.
'They're our front-line people and if they were not properly
customer-focused all our efforts behind the scenes would fall apart.' Hence
his decision to bring all these staff into a customer services unit. By
October, all the appointments had been made, while at the same time the
number of management tiers between any individual and the top had been
reduced to three. Smith expects the changes to yield annual savings of
Pounds 20m within the next two years.
One of the main outstanding tasks is to select a computer system capable of
handling the streamlined flow of data across and up the organisation, in
addition to the downwards route.
'You don't do anything big without computers,' says Smith. 'That was the
third lesson I learnt at Harvard.' Part of the Pounds 60m provision will
help pay for new information technology systems.
Although most consumers feel they do not have a choice of water supplier
Smith says competition is real. He is keenly aware of Severn Trent Water and
Yorkshire Water pressing on his borders and of the possibility of smaller
independent operators moving in to siphon off the most lucrative parts of
the business.
Meanwhile, staff will have to be constantly vigilant to ensure they do not
slip back into their bad habits, he warns.
Cultural changes do not happen overnight, and many companies that embark on
ambitious programmes abandon them half-way through. 'But I'm conscious of
the long, hard road we've embarked on and am absolutely determined not to
give up.'
An article on psychometric tests will appear on Monday's management page.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Management: Ford's global matrix gamble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In just over a fortnight's time, on New Year's Day, one of the boldest
organisational experiments of the decade will kick into action. After a
remarkably - some would say dangerously - short preparation period of only
10 months, the Ford Motor Company will merge its North American and European
operations into a single 'global' structure.
In place of its long-standing twin organisations on each side of the
Atlantic, which suffered from overlap, waste, poor communication and
inadequate exchange of know-how, it is creating five transatlantic 'vehicle
centres', each with responsibility for particular sizes and types of
vehicle. Four of them will be located in the US, but the one with the
greatest growth potential, for small- and medium-sized cars, will be based
jointly in Britain and Germany.
The centres will have responsibility not only for designing, developing and
launching their respective lines of vehicles for North America and Europe,
but also for the profitability and cash flow of each product throughout its
life. Their development responsibilities will also cover Asia, although
Ford's Asia Pacific and Latin American operations will remain officially
separate from the new structure for now.
The group's transformation, christened 'Ford 2000', has rightly attracted
widespread attention on a series of counts:
For its speed: most multinationals in other industries have taken a decade
to shift their organisations gradually from national or regional structures
to near-global ones.
For the degree of 'process re-engineering' involved: a key part of Ford's
transformation is the introduction of a single set of worldwide processes
and systems in product development, production, supply and sales.
For the sharp 'delayering' which is occurring in several parts of the
organisation, halving Ford's average number of levels from 14 to seven.
And for the degree of behavioural and cultural change involved in what is,
in effect, an overdue bid by Ford's new chairman, Alex Trotman, to drag the
company into the late 20th century by removing its outdated military
mentality.
More than most other multinationals outside the Germanic world, Ford has
suffered for too long from a 'command and control' culture which has
fostered the power of departmental barons at the expense of innovation,
speedy decision-making and cross-functional teamwork.
But one key facet of the transformation has received surprisingly little
comment, given its inherently controversial and risky nature: that the new
structure consists of a matrix in which most managers - an estimated 10,000
of them - will find their lives complicated in the new year by having more
than one boss.
Most will report to a manager from one of the new vehicle centres. But they
will also report to an executive from one of the 'functional' departments
(manufacturing, marketing/sales, purchasing etc.)
In many ways, the introduction of this matrix is Ford's most fundamental
change. It is certainly the one being trumpeted most noisily within the
company as vital to global teamwork and organisational effectiveness.
Ford's internal videos and other forms of employee communications have waxed
lyrical over the past few months about the virtues of matrix management.
They claim it provides 'a flexible environment where all avenues are open,
there are no one-way streets and no dead ends'.
In similarly colourful vein, Trotman has declared repeatedly that, compared
with Ford's established, pyramid-like organisation, matrix management will
be 'more like jazz than a structured orchestra'. It will, he promises, allow
considerable informality, and improvisation as situations change.
Trotman's metaphor is striking. But it ignores the fact that, while some
jazz combos do achieve the 'perfect harmony' which Ford says it wants to
create, others produce only cacophony and chaos.
This was certainly the painful outcome of most of the matrix management
practised widely in the 1960s and 1970s, especially by American
multinationals.
With a few notable exceptions, their matrices were plagued by internal
conflict, inefficiency, expense and delay, as divisional, geographic and
functional managers debated and fought with each other. In many cases
disputes were only resolved laboriously by powerful co-ordinators acting as
matrix 'police'.
Ford hopes to rehabilitate matrix management by several means, both 'hard'
and 'soft'. They include: making doubly sure that objectives are agreed
precisely between the vehicle centres and the functional side of the
organisation; specifying clearly the respective roles and responsibilities
of individuals towards each side of the matrix; changing appraisal and
reward systems accordingly; only appointing senior executives who have shown
they can work collaboratively; training everyone involved in the art of
developing a co-operative matrix 'mindset' which largely replaces the need
for policing; and introducing much more intensive and open communication
than the organisation is used to.
Enthusiasm for the new way of working is palpable within the company, not
merely at the top. There is particular excitement about the visibility of
the new vehicle centres, and the global future which they promise.
Yet to an outsider, the organisation has too much of the shape and feel of
what business school academics call a 'balanced matrix', in which the power
of its two sides are too even for them to operate smoothly together. If this
proves to be the case, Trotman will have to do some tricky retuning. That
could prove almost as controversial as the current upheaval.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Councils Shake-up: Target date for most now 1997 - Timing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most of the new councils in England will now start in April 1997, as the
parliamentary timetable looks too tight for all the necessary orders to be
passed in time for the original target of April 1996.
Orders for Cleveland and the Isle of Wight will be debated in parliament
next month. Officials hope that orders for reorganising Avon and Humberside
can also be introduced.
For councils reorganising in 1996, 'shadow councils' must be elected in May
next year to oversee the establishment of the new authority. The shadow
councillors will decide on staffing and accommodation before taking over as
the first elected council.
However, preparations for shadow elections cannot start until orders making
the reorganisation law have been passed by both houses of parliament. In the
case of yesterday's recommendations, Mr Gummer must wait for six weeks after
he has received a proposal from the commission before laying a parliamentary
order, to allow for further consultations.
The shadow authorities will need to take important decisions, and there is
fierce political opposition to any attempt at establishing a new authority
without a formally elected group of councillors.
Personnel decisions will cause the greatest problems. There is contrasting
legal advice over whether all employees of out-going authorities are
guaranteed new jobs with their successors under the Transfer of Undertakings
(Protection of Employment) regulations of 1981, known as Tupe. Unions are
sure to back any redundant employees who claim that Tupe does apply, which
could create years of legal wrangling.
Personnel, plus investment in new information technology systems and, in
some cases, new town halls, will make transition very expensive. Costs could
be greatest in counties where new unitaries and two-tier authorities will
exist side by side. In these cases the commission estimates that there is no
potential for annual savings. Such arrangements will not lead to any cuts in
staff numbers and cannot make any long-term savings, but they will still
cost money to establish.
The Audit Commission predicts that these arrangements will create the
greatest management problems. The counties will have little incentive to
help the unitary city appearing in their midst, and there could be
competition for staff. Government funding, based on needs and current
spending, will also present problems because counties will have an incentive
to understate the amount spent on the new cities.
As cities tend to be more needy than the rural areas around them, the 'rump'
counties will probably have to budget for substantially less government
grant per head of population than they have now. In areas with a solely
unitary structure the costs will still be high. Replacing the relatively
small county of Buckinghamshire with four unitaries, for example, would cost
between Pounds 10m and Pounds 13m.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Councils Shake-up: Mixed views on single-tier structure -
Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Scotland, a uniform single-tier local government structure comes into
effect on April 1 1996, following the passage last month of the Scottish
Local Government Reform Act. Elections for the shadow authorities take place
this April.
There will be 28 single-tier councils in mainland Scotland, replacing the
nine regional and 53 district councils. The three single-tier island
councils will be unchanged.
There was no equivalent in Scotland of Sir John Banham's Local Government
Commission to test local opinion. Instead people were asked about government
white paper proposals for the new councils and the water industry.
Opposition parties had envisaged local government being reorganised only
after the establishment of a Scottish parliament or independent state. But
the government could claim that it has simply implemented commitments
contained in the 1992 general election manifestos of the Labour, Liberal
Democrat and Scottish National parties - as well as its own.
Although all Scottish local authorities are now co-operating with the
Scottish Office over reform, there are widespread misgivings about the loss
of the strategic role played by the nine regional councils. For instance,
Strathclyde Regional Council - centred on Glasgow - is being broken into 12
authorities. Yet where an existing district council will become a unitary
authority, local government staff are showing enthusiasm for the extended
powers.
The government is taking water and sewerage out of local authority control
to set up three state-owned water authorities, involving the private sector
in upgrading facilities.
The Scottish Office intends to hand management of motorways and main dual
carriageways to private companies, which may be asked to co-ordinate the
management of other trunk roads.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Councils Shake-up: Doubt over cost of reorganisation
'gamble' - The new structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's new local government structure was yesterday described by Sir John
Banham, its architect, as a 'gamble' which is also 'a very attractive
investment in anyone's language'.
If this sounds incoherent, it at least reflects the new local government map
which has emerged from two years of consultations by the Local Government
Commission. Plans for 18 counties were announced yesterday, involving total
abolition for only two - Berkshire and Dorset. Sir John estimated the total
cost of implementing yesterday's plans at about Pounds 75m, while plans now
abandoned for creating unitaries would have cost five times that figure.
The commission is unsure whether the 20 proposed new authorities will save
money or create extra costs. It estimated that annual costs could rise by as
much as Pounds 35m or fall by as much as Pounds 10m.
Sir John said the moves were a gamble because there was no evidence that
unitary authorities could improve provision for services such as community
care or education. However, he thought it was an excellent investment
because 'if the new authorities manage to improve their efficiency by only 1
per cent they will pay for the transition costs within nine months'.
Plans for the remaining five English counties - Cornwall, Derbyshire,
Gloucestershire, Hertfordshire and Shropshire - will be announced next
month, but they have already been widely leaked, and the expected
conclusions are shown in the map.
In spite of the government's original intention to create a new single tier
of local authorities - to combine the powers of district and county councils
and improve accountability - only eight counties will be completely replaced
by all-purpose unitary authorities. A total of 45 unitaries will be created,
while 230 districts will remain as part of a two-tier structure, and 31
upper-tier county councils will survive in some form.
Common themes include the unpicking of the work of the last reorganisation
in 1974. Avon, Cleveland and Humberside, all created 20 years ago, are to be
abolished and replaced by smaller unitaries, while Herefordshire and
Rutland, both abandoned in 1974, are to be reinstated.
But this pattern is not universal. Cumbria, a creation of 1974, remains
intact, while Huntingdonshire, subsumed into Cambridgeshire at the same
time, has failed to regain its independent status.
Eight urban areas were yesterday recommended for self-governing unitary
status they lost in 1974 - Brighton and Hove, Leicester, Nottingham,
Plymouth, Southend, Stoke-on-Trent, Swindon, and Torbay - while the counties
surrounding them kept the two-tier structure.
Sir John quoted from the report made by the Redcliffe-Maud commission, whose
advice was overturned in the 1974 reorganisation. This had said that unitary
county boroughs represented local government at its best and 'most
accountable'.
In spite of this praise the Former County Boroughs Group, a council lobbying
body, attacked Sir John on an 'arbitrary U-turn' on unitary status for
several other former county boroughs and said the government should reject
the proposals outright.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Councils Shake-up: Public 'juries' overturned verdict - The
move to let local people decide their own future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Local Government Commission was the child of the poll tax. But unlike
its parent, the commission will not lead to universal upheaval in England's
local government system following yesterday's announcement.
For most of the past three years such upheaval has been on the cards. When
in March 1991 Mr Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary, announced
the abolition of the poll tax and the establishment of a commission to
review England's local authority structure, there was an air of
inevitability about a wholesale move towards single-tier authorities in
place of the two-tier structure of county and district councils prevalent in
most of non-metropolitan Britain.
On the same day it was announced that unitary authorities would almost
certainly replace the two-tier structure in Scotland and Wales - without
recourse to an interim commission.
Senior ministers were known to favour the same outcome for England. It had
already been imposed on London, with the abolition of the Greater London
Council. Broad support for a single-tier structure was also forthcoming from
the opposition Labour and Liberal Democrat parties, and from district
councils, which outnumbered their county cousins - in lobbying power as well
as numbers - by seven to one.
Until this autumn, the commission appeared to be following this pre-ordained
route. Its draft recommendations, most of them published last June, were
largely for unitary authorities as a 'preferred option', heralding the
elimination of county councils.
The explanation for why the apparently inevitable did not happen lies in an
unexpected decision taken by Sir John Banham, the commission's chairman,
early this year.
Sir John took a step quite alien to policy formulation in Britain: he
decided to undertake formal public consultation, holding a postal referendum
in counties where his proposals were most contentious. All households in 33
counties were mailed, with voters invited to give their views to the
commission on the proposed structural changes and alternatives to them.
Had such a step been taken with the poll tax, it would certainly have
failed; so too, in all likelihood, would the move to unitary authorities in
Scotland, which is now an accomplished fact.
The biggest winner in the public consultation was apathy. In only one county
was the response rate higher than 10 per cent of the adult population, a
fair indication that radical change did not enjoy popular support.
However, of the minority who took part in the referenda, in all but a
handful of counties most favoured a continuation of a two-tier structure
although in some cases - such as Devon, Essex, Northamptonshire and
Wiltshire - unitary statusfor a part of the county was supported.
In the last recommendations, the counties recommended for abolition are
those - Dorset, Berks, Beds and Bucks - where the status quo was
emphatically defeated in the referendums.
The decision to consult the people appears to have been taken by Sir John
personally. He received no encouragement from ministers or officials, few of
whom relished the unpredictability of the exercise. But, as Sir John put it
to one audience, the voters were to be the 'jury'.
The fact that the voters largely repudiated his initial recommendations to
abolish 27 county councils left Sir John unfazed. After withdrawing plans to
abolish six counties last month, he said: 'If we had pressed ahead with our
recommendations without listening to local people we would be recommending
transitional costs of the order of Pounds 135m.'
Last month he told the Association of County Councils that unitary
authorities were a 'gamble'. He added: 'People are not willing to support an
expensive gamble on the say-so of local politicians with a vested interest,
and they have not been impressed by many campaigns - at public expense -
designed to persuade them otherwise.' Once controversy over the changes - or
lack of them - has died down, the Local Government Commission's most
enduring legacy may be its novel experiment with postal referenda. The
outcome showed policymakers to be fundamentally out of touch with the people
 -but did so in a way that allowed the policy to be changed before damage
was done.
If so, it will be a final throw-back to the poll tax. Before resorting to
that measure, Mrs Thatcher and Mr Heseltine - then in his first stint as
environment secretary - toyed seriously with the idea of forcing councils to
hold local referenda if they wanted to exceed government spending targets.
They dropped the idea because of opposition from Conservative MPs and
councillors.

In Dorset, the decision to replace the county council with four unitary
authorities has been made in the teeth of opposition from the local business
community, Roland Adburgham writes.
The commission acknowledged that the 'overwhelming preference' of business
people was to have one authority for the Bournemouth conurbation - which
includes Poole and Christchurch - and another for rural Dorset. Instead, it
proposes the conurbation be split into three councils.
The commission did not put forward the two-council option for public
consultation. It argued that a single authority for the urban area would not
take sufficient account of community identities and interests.
Mr Stephen Hall, president of Dorset Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, said
yesterday: 'We are deeply disappointed and will make what representations we
can to the secretary of state. The local political issues have been decisive
and the voice of industry has been ignored.'
The commission said 37 per cent of the 42,000 people who made
representations favoured four councils.

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
In Wales, where the principle of unitary authorities is broadly supported,
reorganisation of local government has been less contentious than in
England.
The Local Government (Wales) Bill to create 22 single-tier councils became
law in July. Shadow elections will be held next May to the new authorities,
which replace eight county and 37 district councils.
The new councils will take over in April 1996. Cardiff, which is at present
run by the city council and South Glamorgan County Council, will gain
unitary status.
Transition committees have been set up for each of the 22 councils to
facilitate the mergers. Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, announced on
Thursday that to meet the reorganisation costs, councils will receive Pounds
43m. Few redundancies are envisaged among the 150,000 full and part-time
workers employed by local government in Wales.
Labour and Plaid Cymru, the nationalist party, unsuccessfully pressed the
case for an elected Welsh assembly as a strategic overlord for the new
structure and a counterweight to the powers of the Welsh secretary and
quangos. But detailed opposition to the bill mostly concerned boundaries and
the proposal by Mr Redwood to allow area committees, with some delegated
powers, in geographically large areas such as Powys. Opponents regard these
as likely to create confusion.
The shadow authorities have to produce service delivery plans by next autumn
and Mr Redwood retains powers to order joint arrangements between
neighbouring councils if he believes that necessary.
Unlike in England, no commission set out to canvass local views. Instead,
there was a white paper which originally proposed 21 councils.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Councils Shake-up: A knight who routs ministers - Profile,
Sir John Banham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir John Banham, who headed the local government review for England, proudly
describes himself as a 'difficult man to direct'.
Successive environment ministers seem to agree with him. Mr Robert Jones,
the local government minister and former chairman of the Commons environment
committee, described Sir John's performance as 'an extraordinary mixture of
self-contradiction, confusion and flippancy'.
He added that many people hoped 'the next tumbril rolling down Whitehall'
would have Sir John inside it.
There has indeed been much self-contradiction and flippancy in Sir John's
language during the past two years as he has guided the Local Government
Commission around England. But they have masked the workings of a canny
political operator who appears to have forced ministers to accept a local
government structure very different from the one they envisaged.
The principles Sir John has applied can be seen in his earlier career. As
first chairman of the Audit Commission, the watchdog body for local
government finance set up by Mr Michael Heseltine in his first spell as
environment secretary, he showed a rigid determination to limit costs.
Then he was director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, with
members that strongly opposed small, fragmented authorities. Large companies
wanted to deal with as few regulation and enforcement officials as possible
and did not want to pay for an expensive reorganisation. That led them to
call either for large unitary authorities, or for the status quo - the
predominant pattern of Sir John's first recommendations last year.
After opposition from district councils forced Mr John Gummer, the
environment secretary, to change his guidance to the commission in September
last year, Sir John's comments were trenchant. He said Mr Gummer's ruling
that the new government structures could be more expensive than those they
replaced was 'absolutely astonishing', and estimated the total cost at
Pounds 1bn.
He followed that with a letter to Mr Gummer saying that backbench
Conservative MPs wanted no change to the system, and a complaint to Mr
Jones's committee that the commission could not finish its work 'unless we
get Whitehall off our backs'.
When it came to reversing the commission's original proposals, Sir John
insisted that they had merely been 'options', and then held expensive
consultations which were not required by legislation. Sir John referred to
these as advisory 'referenda', even after commission staff had objected
strongly to the use of the word.
Once he had obtained the results he expected from the referenda, he knew the
government would find it difficult or impossible to overturn his final
recommendations.
And the man appointed to engineer a radical reform of local government added
a dose of cynicism. 'Any reorganisation costs more and delivers less than
its proponents suggest,' he said. Not an easy man to manage.

FT  16 DEC 94 / When the party is often reluctant to come to aid: The tough
role of being responsible for assistance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Being responsible for aid has long been a task that would daunt many a
British politician.
Aid spending comes low down on voters' priorities, so there is always a
battle to prise money out of the Treasury.
Then there is the need to keep all the various lobbies happy. Business wants
aid to be used to support trade. Many development experts want it to be
focused directly on alleviating poverty.
The Pergau dam case brought these tensions to a head. In its wake Lady
Chalker, now easily Britain's longest-serving aid minister, is left
struggling even more valiantly than before with the need to satisfy everyone
all at once.
Although she acknowledges that the Pergau case will 'undoubtedly have an
effect' on public support for the aid programme in general, she believes
that the ODA is increasingly providing value for money by every yard-stick.
Take the case of the aid and trade provision, which was at the root of the
Pergau case. The rules under which such projects are supported were
tightened last year so that the money goes only to the poorest countries
with a per capita income of less than Dollars 760 (Pounds 463.40).
'A lot of the fury has been as if it was just good for the Malaysian
government or for the Indonesian government or some other government. It
isn't that at all. What I've tried to do is devise a system - which I
believe we've now got - that's on a better basis than it was before.'
One example was the greater Dhaka power project in Bangladesh which is
providing electricity to an area where there was none before and helping
create 250,000 jobs in the recipient country.
It was not the case, as British companies had complained, that German
companies had won the contract to build the Shanghai metro because more aid
was available from their government.
'I don't think that has anything to do with the aid and trade system in
Germany. It has a lot to do with Chancellor Kohl and the sort of dealing
that people are so critical of Lady Thatcher for. Kohl was going to Beijing
and he had his people working on it. It met the (international) rules.'
Some developmentalists suggest Lady Chalker is trying to drum up support for
the aid programme by increasing the role of emergency relief. This raises
the ODA's profile and is the kind of service with which the public readily
identifies.
But the minister denied that this had been at the expense of longer term
development assistance. There had been a number of extraordinary calls for
energy relief such as Bosnia, Rwanda and maybe soon another drought in
southern Africa.
The aid budget has steadily increased in recent years, with a 7 per cent
increase in the overall total announced in last month's Budget. But a sense
of squeeze remains, not least because a greater proportion of the money - 45
per cent at last count - is earmarked for the growing demands of
multilateral agencies such as the European Union and World Bank.
The relative shrinkage of the bilateral aid budget is not necessarily a
matter for regret, she said, because Britain could wield more influence as
part of a group.
'People are actually working more in regional blocs so we have to make that
work better, and I think we can do it. We're getting some very good people
into the EU. The influence of Sweden and Finland on the aid side of the EU
will be extremely bene-ficial to the overall EU programme.'
'We have to get as good quality out of multilateral aid programmes as we can
get out of bilateral aid. Therefore I have turned my attention as to how we
improve the quality of multilateral aid.'
As for the battle with the Treasury to claw back the Pergau money: 'I have a
struggle every single year. If we get that money back it will to me be a
very good thing because I know we can use it. If I don't get it back I shall
regard it as sad but not a catastrophe.'

FT  16 DEC 94 / MoD is urged to sell much of its land
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence should sell large areas of its land, the Commons
defence committee said yesterday.
The MoD owns 561,000 acres of land across Britain and leases a further
39,500 acres. This total is 1 per cent of the area of the UK.
The committee said sites known to be surplus to requirements should be
disposed of. Some sites could be reduced in size and some freehold land
could be sold and leased back.
The committee recommended that the MoD should explore the possibility of
setting up an agency to hold and dispose of surplus land.
The committee's report said: 'We are confident that it should be reduced in
scale, driven not by targets for one-off capital gain, but by military
requirements and assessments of particular sites.'
It added: 'There is scope for greater use of training rights over private
land, including agricultural set-aside land, and of other MoD land, such as
test and evaluation facilities.'
But the committee saw no prospect of military training in the national parks
ending, unless the land concerned was taken out of the parks.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Major in row over early Christmas recess
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An intended goodwill gesture turned sour on Mr John Major yesterday when he
was accused of bringing forward the Christmas parliamentary recess to dodge
a political roasting in the Commons.
In a rare display of public anger, the prime minister vigorously denied that
the earlier break was caused by a desire to avoid a testing question time.
MPs will start their Christmas break on Tuesday instead of Wednesday.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow leader of the Commons, said the scrapping of the
business originally planned for Tuesday would enable the prime minister to
escape a question time session. Mr Major was further angered by her
suggestion that he was resigned to the loss of the Dudley West by-election
and wanted to deprive Mr Ian Pearson, the Labour candidate, of a
high-profile introduction to the Commons on Tuesday.
After an animated conversation with the prime minister, Mr Tony Newton,
leader of the Commons, said MPs ought to know that the recess had been
brought forward a day in response to a request from the office of Mr Tony
Blair, the Labour leader.
After hurried consultations with other members of the Labour front bench Mrs
Taylor insisted that Mr Blair had not requested an earlier start for the
Christmas recess.
She pressed for the reinstatement of prime minister's questions and the
other business planned for Tuesday.
Mr Newton admitted in conciliatory tones that there could have been a
misunderstanding. 'Manifestly the impression had been created in Mr Major's
office that something approaching a request had been made,' he said.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Sleepy MPs plan early nights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bleary-eyed MPs endured a marathon series of debates last night - on the day
that moves were announced to do away with such late-night sittings.
These tests of stamina should become much rarer sights in the Commons once
proposals drawn up by the main parties come into effect.
Amid recent controversy about the long hours which MPs are forced to spend
at the Commons, senior politicians have drawn up a list of changes to the
parliamentary timetable which should be introduced early next year.
They include a pledge by the government to give MPs more time in their
constituencies at weekends and another to avoid late sittings of the Commons
as much as possible.
The proposals, which were announced yesterday by Mr Tony Newton, leader of
the Commons, will reduce the amount of parliamentary business on Fridays.
Instead, private member's motions, which are regularly held at the end of
the week, will take place on Wednesday mornings.
In a parliamentary written answer, Mr Newton said that the Speaker, Miss
Betty Boothroyd, would also have wider discretion to limit speeches by
backbenchers to 10 minutes and by ministers and opposition spokesmen and
women to 20 minutes.
The call for improved parliamentary hours comes amid signs that the current
timetable has badly affected the health of some MPs. Debate on the proposals
is to take place in the Commons on Monday.
Last night's debates, which lasted well past daybreak, gave an opportunity
for backbenchers to raise topics of their choice for a response by
ministers.
The series of short debates was set to be opened after 10pm by Labour's Dr
Jeremy Bray on the issue of 'employment rights after manic depression'.
Other topics expected to be raised were Cyprus, the case for an
international station at Stratford, east London, and the pig industry. The
'night' was expected to end at about 8.30 this morning.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Cabinet quarrel grows over Hercules order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, MICHAEL SKAPINKER and BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A decision by the British government to purchase more than a handful of new
Hercules transport aircraft would severely damage UK participation in the
development of the European Future Large Aircraft, British Aerospace warned
yesterday.
The warning came as a cabinet-level row over how the RAF should set about
replacing its ageing Hercules fleet appeared to gather momentum at
Westminster.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, is understood to be pushing for up to
half the current 60-strong Lockheed Hercules fleet to be replaced with the
same company's C-130J aircraft.
But Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is believed to
favour refurbishment of the current fleet, which the RAF says will need
replacement from 1996. This would enable a decision on a long-term
replacement to be delayed until 2002, when the FLA - for which BAe will
build the wings - becomes available.
If the C-130J is chosen, Mr Heseltine is understood to feel that a maximum
of 15 aircraft - equivalent to an operational RAF squadron - should be
ordered. This would minimise the risk of undermining the FLA's chances of
competing with Lockheed for future orders.
The controversy over the aircraft order came amid signs of a fresh split in
the cabinet over whether the government should offer a referendum on the
next stage of European integration.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has won Mr Heseltine's backing for an
intense behind-the-scenes effort to persuade Mr John Major not to appease
the Tory right by committing the government now to a referendum. Mr Clarke
has told colleagues it would be 'idiotic' to promise a plebiscite without
knowing what, if any, proposals there will be for significant changes to the
structure of the EU.
If Mr Rifkind and Mr Heseltine can reach agreement over the Hercules
replacement, their decision could be rubber stamped by the cabinet, possibly
as soon as next week. But they are said to be far apart at the moment. One
former minister spoke of 'irreconcilable differences' and said he understood
the position was 'deadlocked'.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Rover lifts production by 16.2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rover, the leading UK carmaker, increased its total vehicle production by
16.2 per cent year-on-year in the first nine months, according to figures
released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
Overall car output rose by 3.0 per cent in the first nine months to 1.075m
from 1.044m in the same period a year ago, and the society forecasts
continuing steady growth in production during the mid-1990s.
Higher car output by Rover - a subsidiary of BMW, the German carmaker -
together with the build-up of production by Toyota and Honda at their UK
assembly plants, helped to offset stagnant output at Ford, Vauxhall and
Peugeot and a sharp fall at Nissan.
The rise in Rover car and commercial vehicle output - to 355,419 from
305,831 a year ago - has been driven most importantly by the introduction of
its Rover 600 executive car range, launched in spring last year, as well as
by increasing sales of the Land Rover Discovery.
Rover is currently adding 1,450 jobs at its British plants in response to
strongly rising sales, in particular in export markets.
Mr John Towers, Rover group chief executive, said recently that output for
the full year was expected to rise to about 492,000 from 430,200 in 1993 and
404,900 in 1992. Production is expected to rise significantly above 500,000
in 1995.
Production at Nissan's Pounds 1bn Sunderland car plant fell by 28.2 per cent
during the first nine months to 143,000 from 199,000 in the same period a
year ago.
The company was forced to halve production for nearly four months until
early March with the elimination of its second shift in order to cut stocks
and to bring output into line with sharply lower demand in continental
Europe.
Production at Toyota's Pounds 700m assembly plant at Burnaston near Derby,
which began at the end of 1992, rose to 63,000 in the first nine months from
25,000 a year ago.
Commercial vehicle output has begun to recover strongly from recession this
year, albeit from a low level. Output in the first nine months at 165,161
was 16.7 per cent higher than a year ago. Commercial vehicle production has
been in a state of almost continuous decline since the end of the 1960s,
when it peaked at 466,000 in 1969. Production fell by 22.2 per cent last
year to 193,414, the lowest level of output since 1948.
Truck makers are raising production in response to strongly rising demand in
the domestic market with ERF increasing output by 26 per cent in the first
nine months and the Iveco group raising production by 20 per cent.
Output by Leyland Trucks was 60 per cent higher than a year ago, when the
former Daf group, which included the Leyland plant, went into receivership.
The operation was rescued by a management buy-out in the summer of 1993.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Chalker warns on recouping Pergau expense
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lady Chalker, the minister for overseas development, has warned that her
ministry might not be able to claw back all the money due to be spent in
support of Malaysia's Pergau dam, even though the use of the aid budget for
this purpose has been declared illegal.
The government has said that the Overseas Development Administration's
overall budget will not be affected for the next two years by a recent High
Court ruling that has forced the Treasury to provide Pounds 48m in planned
support for Pergau from its own reserves.
But on Tuesday, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, left open the question
of what would happen in later years when the British government is required
to pay Pounds 122m to the Malaysian authorities.
Lady Chalker said yesterday she expected there would be some 'very tough
talking' with the Treasury over whether the ODA budget should take cuts
commensurate with the amount being paid for Pergau from Treasury reserves.
'It would be nice to have all the addition, but I don't expect we shall get
it all,' she said in an interview with the Financial Times.
Her remarks are bound to concern aid lobbies which had hoped the court
judgment on Pergau would raise the amount of money spent on projects
designed to alleviate poverty.
Under a High Court ruling last month, the ODA cannot make payments for
Pergau because it is deemed 'economically unsound'.
But in a statement to the Commons earlier this week Mr Hurd said the exact
size of the ODA budget from the financial year 1996-97 would have to be
determined in future public expenditure rounds.
Labour MPs and aid groups fear the ODA will end up indirectly financing the
project because the aid budget will suffer cuts to compensate for the
Treasury payments for Pergau.
Labour MPs reacted angrily in the Commons when the government said it would
not restore the Pounds 24m already spent on Pergau to the ODA budget.
But Lady Chalker said that the government had been through the judgment very
carefully. 'I believe we have complied with what the divisional court said
absolutely to the letter.'
The ODA had not decided how to spend the Pounds 48m that would be returned
to its budget this year and next, she said, but it was likely to go on
emergency relief in countries such as Bosnia and Rwanda.
The aid and trade provision had already been set for this year and the money
would not be used for extra projects in this area, she said, although she
defended the use of aid to help UK trade.
'We have an aid and trade system that is strict and gives British companies
the chance to compete on equal terms with other aid donors who are also
interested in trade,' she said.

FT  16 DEC 94 / 17 firms named to handle power sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seventeen investment firms were named yesterday by the government to handle
the sale of its remaining 40 per cent stake in the power generators National
Power and PowerGen.
Although the 17 have been divided into geographical areas, they will all
have equal status as distributors.
The joint co-ordinators are Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Kleinwort Benson
Securities. Other international managers are Cazenove, Paribas, UBS and SG
Warburg.
North American managers are Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan, NatWest
Markets and RBC Dominion. Managers for the rest of the world are Argentaria,
Flemings, Lehman Brothers, Mediobanca, Nikko Securities and WestLB.
Pre-selling of the shares will begin next month, with the sale itself in
February. The value of the shares is about Pounds 4bn, although this will be
reduced after National Power concludes its recent deal to buy back 10 per
cent of its own shares directly from the government.
The government yesterday appointed Morgan Stanley to advise it on the Pounds
4bn flotation of the National Grid Company. Although the company is owned by
regional electricity companies, the government holds a golden share.

FT  16 DEC 94 / EU ban on milk hormone extended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Union agriculture ministers yesterday agreed to extend a ban on the
controversial milk-boosting hormone bovine somatotrophin (BST) for cows
until the end of the decade following widespread resistance to the product.
Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, was alone in voting in favour
of the synthetic hormone, despite strong consumer opposition to its use in
Britain.
BST, which is produced by Monsanto and Eli Lilley, the US biotechnology
companies, is an artificial version of a naturally occurring hormone in cows
which enhances milk output.
Mr Waldegrave said scientific evidence supported the use of BST. Consumers
and animal welfare activists are concerned about its effects, including an
increase in the incidence of mastitis in cows.
There was some confusion over the wording of the Council of Agriculture
Ministers' final decision on BST. Monsanto said the council had agreed that
some farmers could make limited commercial use of the hormone in order to
gain practical experience of its effects. UK government officials said this
would be restricted to field trials.
The product received approval in the US six months ago and since then it has
been used by 10,000 dairy farmers on more than 800,000 cows, Monsanto said.
The European Commission was concerned about the economic damage that could
be done by increasing milk output at a time when quotas are in place to
limit production. The ban on its use will now last until the milk quota
restriction runs out at the end of 1999.
The commission has agreed to prepare a report on further scientific trials
by 1998. Consumer groups have called on the commission to prevent any milk
produced as part of the trials from entering the food chain.
Monsanto said there was no reason why milk produced using BST should not be
sold to consumers. The company produces BST near Vienna and Eli Lilley has a
production site outside Manchester.

FT  16 DEC 94 / MPs criticise coastguard savings target
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Government cost-cutting plans could affect the Coastguard Service's ability
to respond to emergencies, the Commons transport committee said yesterday.
The service was 'thinly stretched' with fewer staff having to deal with an
ever-growing number of incidents, it said in a report.
Pressures on the service, which is responsible for co-ordinating search and
rescue operations, may have led it to rely too heavily on overtime and
part-time auxiliary coastguards.
The MPs added: 'Given financial pressures under which the agency is
presently operating, we are concerned that its present financial target of
achieving a 6.4 per cent saving in the next 18 months might adversely affect
the provision of coastguard services.'
The savings target followed the abandonment of the government's plan to cut
costs by 20 per cent, after the establishment of the service as an executive
agency of the Department of Transport last April.
MPs were concerned the new target, agreed by the service and the transport
department, may have been set too hastily.
They were 'heartened' by assurances from the chief executive that savings
were agreed on the understanding they would not involve closing rescue
centres or detract from operational effectiveness.
Since 1986, the report said, the number of search and rescue incidents dealt
with by the service rose 81 per cent, from 5,300 to 9,610 in 1993. The
number of people rescued increased 91 per cent, from 8,960 to 17,110 last
year.
Over the same period the number of staff fell 7 per cent to its present 480
full-time officers and some 4,000 auxiliaries.
The MPs heard evidence from unions that staff morale was at 'an all-time
low'.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Scots travel group makes foray south
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent

<TEXT>
Direct Holidays, the Glasgow-based direct-marketing holiday group backed by
the Royal Bank of Scotland, yesterday announced its first foray into English
markets with a Pounds 1m investment in running cut-price flights and
holidays from Liverpool Airport.
The company is guaranteeing to undercut the brochure prices of any similar
holiday from Manchester Airport by 21 per cent.
It is tilting at big holiday companies such as Airtours and Thomson, which
run their own aircraft fleets from Manchester and have substantial
investment there in dedicated check-in facilities and aircraft maintenance.
Direct Holidays, founded in 1991 by three former directors of Owners Abroad,
works on the same principle as direct-marketing insurance companies -
cutting out agents, brokers and commission in a mainly telephone sales
operation. It claims to be Scotland's largest direct-sales holidays
business, with a 12 per cent share of the Scottish charter holidays market.
This year it has carried 70,000 passengers using Glasgow and Prestwick
airports, turning over about Pounds 15m. Mr John Boyle, one of the founders,
said current pre-tax profits were about Pounds 450,000 a year.
Liverpool Airport's struggle for growth in Manchester's shadow has provided
the company's first opportunity in England. Mr Boyle's research showed other
regional airports, such as Newcastle, well served by local operators, but
Liverpool had less holiday charter traffic than Exeter.
Two tour operators ceased trading yesterday.
The Civil Aviation Authority said Ultimate Holidays and Transamerica
Holidays were both covered by air travel organiser's licence bonds.
Ultimate Holidays took over Transamerica in July.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Pounds 10bn spent on treating water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 30 regional water companies in England and Wales have spent more than
Pounds 10bn to improve supplies and raise quality since the 1990-91
financial year, according to Ofwat, the regulatory body.
The figure, published in a report on the companies' financial performance
and investment, will stoke criticisms which arose earlier this year over
whether the industry is placing too much of its investment burden on
customers.
Some consumer groups and Labour politicians have claimed that charges have
been raised unnecessarily to fund ambitious investment programmes to improve
supplies and raise water quality to European Union standards.
According to the critics, the companies have financed much of their
investment through excessive charges so they could maintain high profits and
dividends after privatisation in 1989.
But Ofwat argues that the industry has borrowed heavily to finance long-term
spending. The industry's net debt amounted to Pounds 3.3bn at the end of
March - roughly equivalent to the companies' cash requirements since
1990-91. Moreover, almost Pounds 2bn more has been ploughed back through
retained profits.
The surge in borrowing has been reflected in rising interest charges.
Interest payments climbed from virtually nil in 1990-91 to about Pounds 200m
in the last financial year.
The Water Services Association, which groups the 10 biggest companies
handling both fresh and waste water, said about half the industry's
financial needs were now coming from external sources.
In a separate report, Ofwat revealed sharp differences in companies' charges
for delivering water. Costs varied from 41p per cu m at Hartlepools Water to
103p per cu m at Tendring Hundred Water, against an industry average of 58p
per cu m.
Welsh Water was fined Pounds 20,000 yesterday after the Saundersfoot, west
Wales, holiday resort was seriously affected by pollution.
Tenby magistrates heard that large quantities of sewage were discharged into
a stream then on to the beach where people were bathing.
Welsh Water admitted two charges under the Water Resources Act. It was also
ordered to pay Pounds 2,264 costs.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Retail sales stagnate as recovery gains strength:
Manufacturers tell CBI demand is buoyant - Stores say customers are cautious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain continues to experience a joyless economic recovery.
Manufacturers have recorded their strongest improvement in overall demand
for nearly six years this month, the Confederation of British Industry says.
But this buoyancy has not been felt in the high street. Official figures
yesterday showed that retail sales stagnated in November and October.
The CBI's latest survey of manufacturing, published today, suggests output
will grow at an accelerating rate in the next four months. By contrast, the
Central Statistical Office yesterday reported that seasonally adjusted
retail sales rose 2.5 per cent in the year to November, the lowest annual
rise since April 1993.
Together, these latest indicators show how higher taxes and a competitive
exchange rate are rebalancing Britain's economic recovery from the
consumer-led growth of a year ago to an export and manufacturing-led upturn.
The data also reinforced a picture of growth with low inflation. The CBI
survey found no net increase in the number of companies planning to raise
prices in the next four months. The British Retail Consortium, representing
90 per cent of the industry, said cautious consumers were keeping 'retail
inflation at a very low level and margins under pressure'.
Warm weather in November also proved bad for retailers. The consortium said
sales of outerwear, warm clothing and accessories such as hats and gloves
were sharply down. 'The mild weather and absence of epidemics again marred
the sales of over-the-counter medicines,' it added.
The National Lottery was a mixed blessing for retailers. Newsagents said
lottery tickets generated significant extra sales but queues curbed sales of
other goods. Lottery ticket purchases are likely to depress the official
retail statistics since they are not included in the CSO's retail sales
total.
Ticket sales in the four weeks to last Saturday were Pounds 205.1m. If that
pace continues, the lottery will scoop up nearly Pounds 2.7bn in a year,
equivalent to 1.8 per cent of UK retail sales.
The details of the sales figures show that retailers are finding it
difficult to attract shoppers without cutting prices. The consortium says
that department stores reported fragrance sales well ahead, but only with
the help of price promotion that had damaged margins.
Seasonal adjustment is an important part of the statistical process at this
time of year; November is normally the second busiest shopping month. While
the seasonally adjusted figures show no change in sales between October and
November, in unadjusted terms sales actually rose by 7.5 per cent.
The CSO's preferred measure is to use a three-monthly average. On that
basis, sales volumes in the three months to November were 3 per cent higher
than in the same period of 1993. Yet the rise compared with the previous
three months (to August) was just 0.5 per cent. In value terms, unadjusted
retail sales in November were 3.4 per cent higher than in November 1993.
Comparing the three months to November with the previous quarter, the
strongest sector was household goods, which recorded a rise of 1.9 per cent;
the weakest was other non-food, which includes stores such as off-licences,
florists and tobacconists, which reported a fall of 0.9 per cent.
However, food retailers reported sales volumes in the three months to
November which were 0.6 per cent higher than in the previous quarter, and
4.8 per cent higher than in the same period a year ago. The consortium said
fresh produce and poultry sold well, and Christmas foods were in demand.
Significant falls in sales of camcorders, video games and home computers
were reported. Yet sales of white goods, televisions and hi-fis were up on a
year ago.
The CBI survey, which covered 1,207 manufacturers between November 25 and
December 14, found that 27 per cent thought their present order book was
above normal, 19 per cent below normal, and 54 per cent normal.
The resultant plus 8 per cent - which the CBI considers indicative of the
trend - was the highest since January 1989. It compared with a balance of
plus 5 per cent in November and minus 19 per cent in December last year.
Export order books were also above normal, although the balance of plus 7
per cent in December was below November's 10 per cent positive balance.
The CBI indicator of companies planning to raise domestic prices was
unchanged: a positive balance of 22 per cent for both months.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Anglian drops universal metering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglian Water, the water and sewerage company, has dropped its controversial
requirement for customers to have their water consumption metered.
Anglian has been alone among the water groups in pressing for universal
metering, in spite of the additional costs involved.
Metering, which is strongly supported by Ofwat, the industry regulator, is
seen by some observers to be a more equitable form of charging for water
consumption than the present system based on the old rateable values of
properties.
The water companies are all considering alternative methods of charging
before a deadline to revise tariff structures by the year 2000.
Anglian, which has 1.6m customers, will continue to install water meters but
will leave the choice of connection to householders.
Most water companies have come out strongly against metering on cost
grounds. But Anglian, which charges about 12.5 per cent of the households it
supplies based on metered water usage, says the extra costs must be balanced
against savings in capital expenditure which come through reduced
consumption.
The company said greater cost-consciousness among metered consumers could
bring savings of up to 15 per cent. Company policy is also affected by the
local climate: the Anglian region has one of the lowest rainfall rates in
the UK, making water conservation more important.
The group's compulsory metering policy has been widely criticised by
consumers' groups, which have argued that it penalises low income households
with large families.

FT  16 DEC 94 / ITC fines Granada Pounds 500,000 for rule breach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission yesterday issued a clear warning to
the ITV companies that programmes should not be vehicles for selling
products when it imposed a Pounds 500,000 fine on Granada Television.
The fine, the first to be imposed by the ITC under powers provided by the
1990 Broadcasting Act, was for repeated violations of the rules on 'undue
prominence' of products by This Morning, the daily magazine programme
presented by Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan.
There were also breaches of rules over the sponsorship of viewer
competitions. Viewers were invited on the October 12 edition of This Morning
to enter a cookery competition, application forms for which could be
obtained only from branches of the Safeway supermarket chain or by buying
She magazine.
The ITC said yesterday that the rules on sponsorship and undue prominence
were designed to ensure a clear distinction between the editorial content of
programmes and paid advertising or sponsor messages.
'The effect of failure to observe these rules seriously damages the
editorial integrity of programmes,' said the ITC. It could have fined
Granada up to Pounds 4.69m.
Granada last night expressed surprise and disappointment that the ITC had
imposed a sanction 'which seems out of proportion to the nature of the
original offence'.
The company, which this week advertised for a compliance adviser to ensure
ITC rules were observed in all its programmes, said it would need to
consider the implications of the ITC decision carefully. Mr Graham Allen,
Labour broadcasting spokesman, last night congratulated the ITC for taking a
tough line against Granada. He said: 'Finally the ITC has bared its teeth
and sent a signal to the ITV companies that it is not prepared to tolerate
blatant breaches of its codes.'
The ITC identified eight code breaches by This Morning since the new
broadcasting licences began last year.
Granada was given a formal warning for an item transmitted on September 21
which featured Mr Victor Kiam discussing his Lady Remington range of
jewellery. Viewers were then invited to win pieces by devising an
advertising slogan for the range. Granada referred last night to isolated
lapses of editorial judgment which generated no viewer complaints and from
which Granada derived no commercial benefit.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, National Heritage secretary, yesterday prepared the way
for the BBC to launch two planned commercial services in continental Europe.
He laid an order exempting the BBC from getting broadcasting licences from
the Independent Television Commission.
The two satellite services - one dedicated to entertainment and the other
news - must not be directed at UK audiences and must operate as if they were
regulated by the ITC.
There must also be transparent accounts between the BBC's commercial
television services - which are operated in a joint venture with Pearson,
owner of the Financial Times - and their publicly funded services.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Work scheme 'misses short-term jobless'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A government pilot scheme aimed at helping find jobs for those out of work
for more than two years is at the expense of the short-term unemployed, a
report by the Institute for Employment Studies has found.
The report found just under half of the employers who participated in the
scheme - which has been on trial since last year in Tyneside, Devon and
Cornwall, east Kent and south-west London - hired a long-term unemployed
person when previously they would have recruited someone out of work for
less than two years.
The Workstart scheme, which is run by the Employment Service and training
and enterprise councils, provides a subsidy of Pounds 60 a week for 26 weeks
and Pounds 30 a week for a further 26 weeks for each candidate hired.
Before participating in the programme, 77 per cent of the 399 Workstart
employers surveyed said they had not recruited anyone who had been
unemployed for more than two years.
Without the scheme, 45 per cent of those polled said they would not hire a
long-term unemployed candidate.
The report found that 17 per cent of the jobs filled by Workstart recruits
were created as a result of the subsidy. In a further 27 per cent of the
jobs, the scheme had a positive influence on the positions offered, by
increasing the working time or the duration of the job, or by leading to the
creation of a larger number of vacancies.
However, in London only 7 per cent of the jobs given to Workstart candidates
were created because of the scheme. The report said this could be due to the
restriction of eligibility in the London trial to those unemployed for more
than four years. It said London employers were more likely to use the
subsidy for existing and hard-to-fill vacancies.
The trial was most successful among smaller, private companies in the
service sector. Two-thirds of those polled had fewer than 10 full-time
employees.
Employers were satisfied with their new recruits, with 80 per cent saying
that the employees met their expectations. Almost all of the employers said
they expected to keep on the recruit after the subsidy expired and
two-thirds said they would be more likely to recruit long-term unemployed
people in the future.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced in the Budget that Workstart
would receive Pounds 7.5m funding for a further 5,000 job opportunities in
new trials around the country.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Main plank of job tribunal plans attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial tribunal users yesterday rejected a central plank of the
government's proposals to reduce tribunal delays and raise standards.
Employers, lawyers and trade unions criticised the government's green paper
for placing too much power in the hands of tribunal chairmen and failing to
address the issue of additional funding.
Chairmen, who are legally trained, sit alongside two lay members
representing the interests of employers and employees. The green paper
suggests chairmen should sit alone in 'relatively straightforward or
technical types of proceedings', which do not include claims of unfair
dismissal and discrimination.
Mrs Janina Schiebler, a lay tribunal member who represents employers'
interests in the Norwich area, said: 'I think you get a more balanced
viewpoint when there are three of us. We sit and discuss different points of
view and we all have totally different questions.'
Employment lawyers, who have been criticised for their increasing
involvement in tribunals, also argue against greater powers for tribunal
chairmen.
Mr Stephen Levinson, head of the employment department of City solicitors
Paisner &amp; Co, said: 'Chairmen sitting alone would help if you are concerned
with getting through cases quicker, but that has to be balanced against the
function of the tribunal as an industrial jury. The criticism put forward is
that tribunals are too legalistic, but you make them more legalistic if the
only person running them is a lawyer.'
The green paper follows a 150 per cent increase in tribunals' workload over
the past five years to 73,000 cases last year.
Delays are particularly long in London and the south-east of England. The
tribunals' budget has risen by 75 per cent since 1988 to Pounds 26.6m this
year and the number of administrative staff has increased by 64 per cent
from 290 to 475.
Mr Levinson, who sits on tribunal user groups in the London area, claims the
system's delays are caused by underfunding.
'They ought to be looking at the resources they put into the administration
of the tribunals. One of the biggest problems at the moment is that they do
not have enough people to cope with the volume of cases.'
The tribunal green paper concentrates on streamlining measures which include
imposing time limits on the presentation and cross-examination of evidence.
Other efficiency measures, such as giving tribunals the power to weed out
weak cases at pre-hearings, won broad approval from all parties.
Mr Peter Skyte represents tribunal applicants as a regional officer of the
white collar union MSF.
He said: 'It seems obvious and sensible to weed out the cases which have not
got a hope in hell's chance of success.
'But the danger is that any extension of the pre-hearing review system will
be used to make life difficult for applicants as a way of frightening people
off even in cases which have a reasonable chance of success.'
However, employers' organisations and trade unions agree with green paper
proposals to give the conciliation service Acas a wider role in resolving
cases.
Mr Peter Martin, head of legal services at the Engineering Employers
Federation, said: 'Employers and employees will be interested in ways of
settling cases more quickly.
'But some of the other suggestions may be considerably more contentious.'

FT  16 DEC 94 / Mercury to end Enfield campaign
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury, the telecommunications company, is to end its television
advertising campaign which features comedian Harry Enfield, it said
yesterday.
The comic has played the part of stuffy Mr Grayson, alongside his friend Mr
Cholmondley-Warner, for 2 1/2 years in the parody of old black and white
newsreel films. During this time the company has gained more than 1m
customers.
The change follows the shake-up announced 10 days ago in which 2,500 staff
will lose their jobs - more than a quarter of the workforce. Mercury plans
to concentrate on business users and is to abandon its public payphone
operation.
The award-winning campaign broke new ground in advertising techniques. The
company said: 'It's been a really brilliant campaign for us but it's no
longer really relevant.'
Last year the company spent Pounds 12m on advertising.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Peugeot workers reject pay offer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 2,500 car workers at Peugeot Talbot's Coventry plant will be
balloted in the new year on industrial action after rejecting a two-year pay
deal by almost four to one.
The staff, members of the TGWU, were offered 3.5 per cent in the first year
of the deal and 4 per cent - or the rate of inflation, if higher - in 1996.
One area of disagreement is over compensation for loss of premium payments
after the Ryton plant's recent move to a double day-shift pattern, with work
starting at 6am and 2pm.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Lloyd's plans rise in motor insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Motor underwriters at Lloyd's of London are investigating the feasibility of
a joint body to increase the number of policies sold by the insurance market
to drivers, Ralph Atkins writes.
Lloyd's syndicates account for about 15 per cent of the private car
insurance market but trade as individual organisations under different
names. This means potential customers contacting Lloyd's central
organisation cannot be passed direct to underwriters, said Mr Peter
Routledge, chairman of a Lloyd's Motor Underwriters' Association working
party.
Competition is also intensifying in the private motor insurance market with
companies such as the Royal Bank of Scotland's Direct Line increasing their
market share by selling over the telephone.
Any joint Lloyd's scheme would have to overcome the problem of deciding how
potential customers should be allocated to different syndicates.

FT  16 DEC 94 / November retail figures confirm sluggish demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Official figures on November retail sales confirmed the impression left by
the Confederation of British Industry survey this week - that consumer
demand was sluggish in the run-up to the vital Christmas period.
Retailers are finding it difficult to attract shoppers without cutting
prices. For example, according to the British Retail Consortium, department
stores reported that fragrance sales were well ahead, but only with the help
of price promotion that had damaged margins.
Mr Hugh Clark, the consortium's trading policy director, said: 'Whilst
spending slightly more overall, consumers have adopted a more cautious and
demanding approach, researching carefully and seeking out the best value,
keeping retail inflation at a very low level and margins under pressure.'
November's 2.5 per cent annual rise in retail sales volumes, seasonally
adjusted, is the lowest increase since April last year. In October the
annual rise was a revised 3 per cent.
Seasonal adjustment is an important part of the statistical process at this
time of year; November is normally the second busiest shopping month. While
the seasonally adjusted figures show no change in sales between October and
November, in unadjusted terms sales actually rose by 7.5 per cent.
The Central Statistical Office's preferred measure is to use a three-monthly
average. On that basis, sales volumes in the three months to November were 3
per cent higher than in the same period of 1993. However, the rise compared
with the previous three months (to August) was just 0.5 per cent.
In value terms, unadjusted retail sales in November were 3.4 per cent higher
than in November last year.
Comparing the three months to November with the previous quarter, the
strongest sector was household goods, which recorded a rise of 1.9 per cent;
the weakest was other non-food, which includes stores such as off-licences,
florists and tobacconists, which reported a fall of 0.9 per cent.
Clothing and footwear sales also fell, both between October and November,
and on a three month on three month basis. The mild weather affected sales
of coats, hats and gloves.
However, food retailers reported sales volumes in the three months to
November which were 0.6 per cent higher than in the previous quarter, and
4.8 per cent higher than in the same period a year ago. The British Retail
Consortium said fresh produce and poultry sold well, and Christmas foods
were in demand.
Significant falls in sales of camcorders, video games and home computers
were reported. Yet sales of white goods, televisions and hi-fis were up on a
year ago.

FT  16 DEC 94 / MPs urge sale of surplus MoD land
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence should sell large areas of its land, the Commons
defence committee said yesterday.
The MoD owns 561,000 acres of land across Britain and leases a further
39,500 acres. This total is 1 per cent of the area of the UK - only the
Forestry Commission controls more land.
The committee said sites known to be surplus to requirements should be
disposed of. Some sites could be reduced in size and some freehold land
could be sold and leased back.
The committee recommended that the MoD should explore the possibility of
setting up an agency to hold and dispose of surplus land.
The committee's report said: 'We are confident that it should be reduced in
scale, driven not by targets for one-off capital gain, but by military
requirements and assessments of particular sites.'
It added: 'There is scope for greater use of training rights over private
land, including agricultural set-aside land, and of other MoD land, such as
test and evaluation facilities.'
But the committee saw no prospect of military training in the national parks
ending, unless the land concerned was taken out of the parks.
It highlighted increasing concern over public access to training and other
MoD land.
'While defence interests must remain paramount, the fact of public ownership
should be the starting point for policies on access to it,' it said.
The committee warned the military authorities that 'legitimate access
carelessly denied diminishes public support for legitimate military
activities'.
It called on the government to provide funds from outside the defence budget
to help maintain the MoD's 700 historic buildings and ancient monuments.
They range from prehistoric earthworks and listed dovecotes to pig sties and
public houses.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Manufacturing demand 'buoyant'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Demand for British manufactured goods is more buoyant than at any time since
January 1989 and more companies are forecasting higher output in the next
four months, the Confederation of British Industry reported today.
In its monthly trends survey for December, the CBI pointed to continuing
upward pressure on output prices, although the number of companies expecting
to increase prices in the next four months is unchanged.
Mr Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate director responsible for economic
analysis, said the latest survey showed that 'the manufacturing recovery is
likely to continue at a smart pace into the new year, with overall demand
improving to its best level for nearly six years'.
The survey, which covered 1,207 manufacturers between November 25 and
December 14, found that 27 per cent thought their present order book was
above normal, 19 per cent below normal, and 54 per cent normal. The
resultant plus 8 per cent - which the CBI considers indicative of the trend
 -was the highest since January 1989. It compared with a balance of plus 5
per cent in November and minus 19 per cent in December last year.
Export order books were also above normal, although the balance of plus 7
per cent in December was below November's 10 per cent positive balance.
The CBI indicator of companies planning to raise domestic prices was
unchanged: a positive balance of 22 per cent for both months. Some 54 per
cent of companies expected prices to stay unchanged in the next four months.
Mr Junankar said that a fuller assessment of inflation prospects would have
to wait for next month's more comprehensive quarterly CBI survey of
industrial trends.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Scots holiday group to start flights from Liverpool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Direct Holidays, the Glasgow-based direct-marketing holiday group backed by
the Royal Bank of Scotland, yesterday announced its first foray into English
markets with a Pounds 1m investment in running cut-price flights and
holidays from Liverpool Airport.
The company is guaranteeing to undercut the brochure prices of any similar
holiday from Manchester Airport by 21 per cent.
It is tilting at big holiday companies such as Airtours and Thomson, which
run their own aircraft fleets from Manchester and have substantial
investment there in dedicated check-in facilities and aircraft maintenance.
Direct Holidays, founded in 1991 by three former directors of Owners Abroad,
operates on the same principle as direct-marketing insurance companies by
cutting out agents, brokers and commission in a mainly telephone sales
operation.
It claims to be Scotland's largest direct-sales holidays business, with a 12
per cent share of the Scottish charter holidays market.
This year it has carried 70,000 passengers using Glasgow and Prestwick
airports, turning over about Pounds 15m.
Mr John Boyle, one of the founders, said current pre-tax profits were about
Pounds 450,000 a year.
The Royal Bank of Scotland recently bought a 22 per cent stake to enable the
latest expansion, which will add flights from Aberdeen and Edinburgh in
1995.
Liverpool Airport's struggle for growth in Manchester's shadow has provided
the company's first opportunity in England. Mr Boyle's research showed other
regional airports, such as Newcastle, well served by local operators, but
Liverpool had less holiday charter traffic than Exeter.
The gap between the two north-western airports was illustrated this week
when Manchester released its November passenger figures - 794,000  -
bringing the total for the first 11 months of the year to more than 14m
people. Liverpool airport handles only 500,000 passengers a year.
Mr Boyle said Direct Holidays was aiming at the 1.4m-population Merseyside
conurbation. It would operate from May until October, offering 35,000 seats
to nine destinations in the Balearics, Canaries, Spanish mainland, Portugal
and Turkey. Aircraft will be chartered from Air Europe, Futura, Caledonian
and Pegasus.
The company is to set up a secure car park for customers, close to the
terminal, charging Pounds 5 a week - half the price of a taxi ride from
Liverpool city centre and less than a fifth of the cost of a week's parking
at Manchester's long-stay car parks, which are remote from the terminals.
Liverpool is opposing Manchester's plans at a public inquiry for a second
runway, arguing its airport should be encouraged to grow to 12m passengers a
year by 2030.
Manchester's second runway is supported by a large majority of north-western
business leaders. Outside Merseyside, most support complementary development
of Liverpool in holiday charter, freight or niche markets, of which the
Direct Holidays expansion will be seen as typical.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Gas chief faces grilling over salary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Cedric Brown, the British Gas chief executive, is to be forced to deliver
a detailed public justification of the company's decision to give him a 75
per cent pay rise while cutting staff numbers and wages.
Mr Brown and two other executives of privatised utilities were yesterday
called to give evidence to an inquiry into executive salaries launched by
the Commons employment committee.
Mr Brown will appear at a public hearing in January, together with Mr James
Smith, chairman of Eastern Electric, and Sir Desmond Pitcher, chairman of
North West Water.
Mr Greville Janner, the committee's Labour chairman, said there was
'absolutely no doubt that the committee will want to ask Mr Brown about what
I regard as a very insensitive decision'.
The inquiry reflects growing concern among MPs of all parties about big
increases in executive salaries, especially those awarded to managers of the
privatised utility companies.
In a sign of the government's embarrassment on the issue, Mr John Major
condemned 'unjustified' executive pay rises in the Commons last month,
shortly after it was announced that Mr Brown's salary had been increased to
Pounds 475,000.
The cabinet's industry sub-committee yesterday discussed proposals drafted
with the support of Mr Major and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that
would make executive salary packages subject to affirmative resolutions by
shareholders. Yet there were indications that Mr Major's support for a
change in the law was cooling in the face of difficulties identified by Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
Mr Heseltine told the committee that tougher shareholder powers would hinder
companies' ability to hire the best staff, and warned that changes to
company law might be difficult to draft and might trigger opposition from
Tory MPs.
In the Commons Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, demanded regulation of
'excesses that are offensive to the British sense of justice'.
Mr Major accused him of seeking either rigid government controls on pay or
renationalisation. 'In one sense you oppose monopoly, in another sense you
oppose competition. The reality is that you just oppose the private sector,'
he said.
Later Mr Blair said the salaries of most privatised utility chairmen had
risen three times faster than average earnings since privatisation. In a
letter to the prime minister, Mr Blair said that top salaries had risen by
311 per cent in the gas industry, 497 per cent in telecommunications, 116
per cent in the water industry, and 25 per cent in the electricity industry.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Showroom staff face bleak new year: The reasons for cuts in
pay and conditions planned by British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas's remaining showroom staff face an uncertain future as the
company pursues its aim of turning a loss-making retail business into a
'lean and mean' organisation capable of survival in the increasingly
competitive high street market.
Its business plan has involved the closure of 160 showrooms this year with
26 of the remaining 266 'under review'. Staffing is being cut from 4,000 at
the beginning of this year to a target of 1,300. About 1,000 have already
gone without the need for compulsory redundancies.
But this will not be enough for British Gas to make a profit on its showroom
activities within five years. The showrooms are believed to be losing about
Pounds 100m a year at present, hence the reason for trying to cut labour
costs.
From January 1 the showrooms will be turned into a separate retail business
unit which will be expected to become viable on its own. British Gas has
told trade unions that this will mean a drastic upheaval for staff if the
showrooms hope to survive.
Company negotiators have told the unions that they want to maintain British
Gas's reputation as a 'good employer'. In its proposals set out in October
the company sought to reassure showroom staff it would not impose immediate
radical cuts in their living standards as part of the business plan.
There is no intention to make any changes in pay levels or employment terms
of the existing 3,000 staff until at least June 30, the unions have been
told.
What happens after that will depend on the business performance of the
remaining showrooms during the first six months of next year, although
British Gas has already told unions no pay rise can be expected for staff
next year.
The company plans to introduce new terms and conditions of employment for
new staff. This will mean market-related pay with no automatic salary
progression, and performance-based incentives covering all grades. New
entrants will be paid between Pounds 9,000 and Pounds 9,700 a year.
There is also to be increased flexibility in working hours with reduced
overtime payments, provisions for Sunday working and an end to premiums for
working on a Saturday. Holidays will be cut from a maximum of 33 days a year
to 27 days and there will be bank holiday working.
Sick pay will be reduced for short-service employees and a longer qualifying
period imposed for others.
All staff will be affected by the company's proposal to achieve what it
calls a new balance between basic salaries paid to showroom staff and their
commission. The new system will come into force on January 1, replacing the
current regionally based commission pay schemes.
British Gas wants to make up to 30 per cent of staff earnings dependent on
commission. At present commission accounts for about 15 per cent and is not
linked to business performance.
Under the new scheme every sales worker will be given a weekly net sales
target which will be calculated from how much income each has to generate to
cover their own costs as well as their share of their shop's fixed costs. No
commission will be paid until a minimum group performance level has been
achieved which equates to the particular gas showroom breaking even.
Unions have been told the principle behind the new commission scheme is to
reward real achievement and not mere attendance. Commission payments will be
triggered at various levels of sale above a management-set performance
target. There is to be no ceiling on potential commission earnings.
British Gas says the changes will bring pay rates into line with its main
competitors, where staff earn between Pounds 7,000 and Pounds 9,000 a year
compared with British Gas levels of between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 13,000.
The company can also point out that it is behaving in the same way as the
privatised electricity companies which have over the past two years
recruited new showroom staff at lower wage rates and on inferior terms.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Cancer drug test results raise hopes on treatment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A maverick drugs industry entrepreneur may be about to prove his detractors
wrong with a cancer drug that appears to be as good as existing treatments,
but without severe side-effects.
The drug will be submitted for regulatory approval in the first quarter of
1995 and could be on sale in Europe by 1996.
Dr David Horrobin's company, Scotia Pharmaceuticals, yesterday published
final-stage clinical trial results on EF13, a pancreatic cancer drug, which
show that the life expectancy of cancer sufferers increased by up to
two-thirds compared with patients on chemotherapy.
Shares in Scotia Pharmaceuticals rose 21p to 274p after the company
presented its results to City analysts. With the price rise, Scotia has
become the UK's second biggest biotechnology company by market
capitalisation.
Cancer experts gave the results a cautious welcome. Professor Gordon McVie,
scientific director at the Cancer Research Campaign, a London-based charity,
said the results were encouraging. But he pointed out that the trials, which
compared EF13 with historic data on mortality, would have been more
convincing if the drug had been compared with a placebo in which neither
doctor nor patient knew what was being administered.
Scotia said the promising preliminary trial data meant there were ethical
problems in knowingly withholding the drug from sufferers.
Professor Karol Sikora, cancer consultant at Hammersmith Hospital, London,
said the results were 'interesting' but that 'much more evaluation' was
needed.
Cancer of the pancreas is one of the deadliest forms of the disease, with
about 60,000 deaths a year in Europe and North America. The historic data
suggest that, with the normal treatment regime in the UK, average life
expectancy is just over three months. With the intensive chemotherapy
sometimes used in the US, the figure is seven months. With high doses of
EF13 patients survived for a year on average.
As the trial was not placebo-controlled it is possible that patients on EF13
survived longer because they had been selected for being stronger or because
doctors gave them extra attention.
Success for the drug would vindicate Dr Horrobin's championing of an obscure
corner of chemistry dealing with fatty acids. Normally, drug research is
based on protein chemistry.
The former professor of medicine at Montreal University began by selling
evening primrose oil, a natural source of fatty acids, in health food shops

FT  16 DEC 94 / 'Homes for votes' inquiry adjourned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROB EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The public inquiry into alleged gerrymandering at Westminster City Council
has been adjourned, delaying its completion until the new year.
The inquiry was due to end in the middle of next week, but was adjourned so
that questions could be answered in writing by an important witness - Mr
Jeremy Sullivan QC, the barrister who advised councillors on the legality of
their actions.
Many of those accused of gerrymandering through the sale of council homes
have said that they received advice from Mr Sullivan approving the sales.
They have argued that such legal advice should protect them from being
surcharged Pounds 21.25m - the money allegedly wasted through the sales.
However, there is a dispute over what was actually said at a meeting on May
5, 1987 between Mr Sullivan and three council officials.
Last week district auditor Mr John Magill put a series of written questions
to Mr Sullivan to clarify the advice he gave at the meeting.
Yesterday Mr Magill approved an application to put further questions to Mr
Sullivan. This was made by Mr Christopher Clarke QC, representing one of the
accused, Mr Robert Lewis, former deputy chief solicitor at the council who
was at the meeting.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Academics claim audit body is undemocratic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of accounting academics has launched an attack on the authority of
the audit profession's main regulator, the Auditing Practices Board,
claiming that it is undemocratic.
The 36 academics have called, in a written submission to the board, for the
creation of an independent body accountable to parliament.
Mr Prem Sikka, reader in accounting at the University of East London, said:
'To the best of my knowledge this is the largest number of academics ever to
sign a submission and publicly express a vote of no confidence in a standard
setting body.'
The group was responding to a consultation paper on the regulator's future
programme of work. Last week the board published its long-awaited paper on
audit reform - The Audit Agenda.
The academics have attacked the regulator's right to determine policy.
'The APB is a division of a limited company, CCAB Ltd. In our view it has no
democratic mandate to formulate audit policy for the UK, ' says the
submission.
'The APB is owned by six major UK accountancy bodies who continue to control
the agenda and parameters of discussion. It is not independent of the
profession.'
The academics, who have all put their names to the submission, claim that
the board is 'unduly influenced' by members of the big accountancy firms.
'There is no moral or ethical reason for allowing partners from such firms
to make UK audit policy,' says the submission.
The academics also argue that because the standard-setting process in audit
relies on volunteers it will never reflect the views of small practitioners
or interested parties such as pensioners or employees.
'Major firms and their corporate patrons are able to buy influence by
seconding individuals to the APB and its committees.'
Finally the academics say that the board has been diverted from considering
how to prevent further audit failures leading to corporate collapses.
'We urge the APB and its sponsors to join us in calling on the government to
appoint an independent body to regulate all aspects of auditing,' they say.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Housing groups to issue Eurobond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of medium-sized housing associations have reduced the cost of
raising funds by forming a company into which they will pledge future rental
income.
UK Rents (No1) will issue a Pounds 36.6m Eurobond with both interest and
principal repaid from the rents. The company will be a 'special purpose
vehicle' - an arms-length company for the housing associations. Because the
bond is expected to be assigned the highest possible rating from two
credit-rating agencies, funding costs are nearly 1 per cent lower than those
typically obtained by housing associations in recent issues.
The deal, developed by Nomura International, the Japanese securities house,
is the first in the UK but resembles other 'securitised' transactions in
which companies sell pools of mortgage obligations or other 'receivables' to
raise money.
Ms Barbara Ainger, chief executive of The Housing Finance Corporation, said
the deal would enable the associations 'to make full use of the strengths of
their rental income flows'. She added: 'This will enable them to benefit
from a very attractive funding cost for long-term finance and opens up new
international markets for investment in UK social housing.' The corporation
funds and monitors the work of housing associations, which provide low-cost
rented accommodation or home-ownership schemes and control about 4 per cent
of housing stock.
Six associations - Cheviot of Newcastle upon Tyne, Beaver of London, Kelsey
of Orpington, Portico of Manchester, the Portsmouth Housing Association and
Mercian of Birmingham - are involved.
The issue, which has a maturity of 30 years, has been launched at a spread
of 75 basis points (a basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point)
over the UK government bond which matures in 2017. Other issues by housing
associations have been at a spread of between 150 and 165 basis points over
the government bond.
The AAA rating expected from Duff and Phelps Credit Rating and Moody's
Investors Services meant the issue could be placed with a number of new
investors who previously have been unable to buy unrated housing association
issues.

Senior civil servants are following a secret political agenda to destroy the

Macara, chairman of the British Medical Association, said yesterday.
Dr Macara said a 'politically inspired mission' was behind moves to
introduce local pay for health workers. He made the claims as he outlined

FT  16 DEC 94 / RPI advisers back loan interest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Advisers to the Central Statistical Office yesterday issued a report to the
Treasury recommending that mortgage interest payments should continue to be
included in the official measurement of the retail prices index, with some
small statistical modifications.
The recommendation is likely to irritate some economists, who argue that the
system of measuring housing costs should be changed. Sir Samuel Brittan, the
Financial Times' chief economic commentator and a member of the RPI advisory
committee, argued that the inclusion of mortgage interest payments distorts
the inflation data, since it means that the official RPI is boosted by
interest rate rises - even though interest rate rises are intended to curb
inflation.
The majority of the committee pointed out that the index is not only
intended to provide an indicator of inflation, but also to be a
cost-of-living indicator and is used to upgrade pensions and benefits.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Local authorities have been given the go-ahead to spend more on public
transport projects such as bus priority routes, cycle lanes and pedestrian
safety schemes under funding plans announced by the government yesterday.
The number of local authority schemes has trebled to 37 while the funds
available have increased from Pounds 13m to Pounds 64m.
Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, unveiled a total local authority
spending programme of Pounds 960m in 1995-96 compared with just over Pounds
1bn planned for this year. However, only Pounds 298m of this total is grant,
compared with Pounds 342m this year. The rest comprises approvals for loans.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Hurdles to open access attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lack of publicity and a series of bureaucratic obstacles are to blame for
the lack of interest being shown in the government's openness code, says the
parliamentary ombudsman, William Lewis writes.
Mr William Reid, reporting on the first eight months of the code of practice
for access to government information, highlighted the steps individuals have
to go through. 'The sequence is sufficiently daunting to deter all but the
most determined seekers after information from going through to the end with
it,' he said.
Individuals must make a written request for information, another request for
a departmental review if the information is not supplied, and then approach
an MP before the complaint can be dealt with by him.
The code came into operation in April amid claims that it would open up
previously secret documents and research held by government departments and
quangos.
However MPs have referred only 24 complaints to Mr Reid, of which he has
investigated nine. Based on the experience of other countries, Mr Reid said
he expected to have received approximately 200 complaints by now.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Customers unaware of new gas measures
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Down at the Peckham gas showroom in south London yesterday customers were
unaware of the impending changes. Detailed leaflets explaining what will
happen were piled on the bill payment counter and there were posters around
the walls to do the same.
But the customers were already finding it hard to cope. Two telephone lines
to connect them with the accounts office to discuss problems over bills
seemed permanently engaged. 'We are using contract staff - and not many of
them. Such a large number in accounts have already taken voluntary
redundancy,' explained one showroom assistant.
British Gas argues customers will be able to pay their bills through any
post office and will be encouraged to arrange payment through banks. In
future, customers will have to ring different phone numbers from outside the
showrooms to deal with gas bill and service inquiries, the reporting of gas
leaks and to receive free advice on saving energy.
The leaflet at Peckham, which is standard through all showrooms, says: 'At
British Gas we're always keen to improve our service. So to give you more
choice and more specialised attention we're making important changes to all
our gas shops.' As it explains, the aim is to 'make sure more staff are free
to help you choose the appliance that's right for you'.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Nescafe price rise ignores the trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nestle, the multinational food company which produces the Nescafe brand of
coffee, said yesterday it will go ahead with a 7 per cent increase in
wholesale prices from December 20 in spite of a sharp drop in world prices
over the past week.
Since the company announced the planned price rise on December 7,
international coffee prices have dropped by 13 per cent. The world market
has fallen by 40 per cent since September as assessments for world supply
have become more optimistic.
Nestle's forthcoming price increase will be the third rise this year in the
wholesale market, and will inevitably push up consumer prices. The company
said yesterday that it does not respond to short-term changes in coffee bean
prices.
Kraft Jacobs Suchard, part of the Philip Morris group and one of Nestle's
competitors, announced yesterday it was cancelling a planned increase in
French retail coffee prices over the next three months. The company said
this was in response to lower world prices.
World prices tripled this year after frosts damaged coffee trees in Brazil
during the main growing season. The market peaked at over Dollars 4,000
(Pounds 2,440) a tonne in September, but by yesterday had slipped to Dollars
2,510 a tonne. Trading at the London Commodity Exchange showed some
consolidation yesterday after a Dollars 200 drop in the market on Wednesday,
but prices remain weak.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Government pledge satisfies unionists: Loyalists say
constitutional guarantee is main concern - Ancram says surrender of arms is
vital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Loyalist leaders yesterday emerged from an historic first round of talks
with British government officials and said they were satisfied that
guarantees that the province would remain part of the UK would be honoured.
Mr Billy Hutchinson, leader of the delegation from the Progressive Unionist
party, which has close links with the Ulster Volunteer Force, said after
three hours of talks: 'We are confident the constitutional guarantee is
safe.'
Mr Gary McMichael, leader of the delegation from the Ulster Democratic party
 -which has insights into the thinking of the Ulster Defence Association,
the other main unionist paramilitary group - also said he was satisfied
there would be no change in the constitutional guarantee that Ulster would
remain part of the UK while that was the majority wish.
'We have seen the British government discussion document and we are
satisfied the constitution is safe,' he said.
Mr Hutchinson, who has served a prison sentence for terrorist crimes, said
the questions of arms surrender and prisoners were discussed, but were
secondary to the constitutional question.
He said: 'The surrender of arms is some way down the road. Guns and
prisoners come second after our constitutional concerns.'
The talks came on the anniversary of the Downing Street declaration, nine
weeks after the loyalists announced their ceasefire and six days after the
first exploratory talks between Sinn Fe'in, the political wing of the IRA,
and British government officials.
Like those with Sinn Fein, yesterday's talks dealt with how representatives
of the paramilitary groups might enter the peace process.
Mr McMichael said his delegation also discussed the arms and prisoners
issues. 'The question of arms is something which will have to be dealt with.
But talks are at a very early stage.' Prisoners were high on the UDP's
agenda, he said.
Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland political development minister who
is in overall charge of discussions with the loyalists and Sinn Fein, said
that arms decommissioning was central to the exploratory talks as far as the
British government was concerned. Speaking after the meetings with the
loyalists, he said: 'The surrender of arms is central to the talks. You
cannot have any groups threatening to go back to violence if things do not
go their way.'
Both Mr McMichael and Mr Hutchinson were unhappy with the government's
suggestion in a discussion document that their parties did not enjoy
sufficient electoral support to warrant participation in wider all-party
talks on the future of the province.
Mr Hutchinson said: 'Our mandate is the guns have fallen silent.'
The 10 loyalists involved in yesterday's talks brokered the loyalist
paramilitary ceasefire. The talks are scheduled to resume next Friday.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Delegates with a history of violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 10 loyalists who met senior British government officials yesterday were
in two five-man delegations - one from the Progressive Unionist party and
one from the Ulster Democratic party.
The Progressive Unionists have insights into the Ulster Volunteer Force and
the Ulster Democratic party is familiar with the thinking of the Ulster
Defence Association, the other main unionist paramilitary group.
The PUP and UDP have only two elected councillors between them and won only
0.5 per cent of the vote in the last local elections. Two councillors from
the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist party have recently said they will
defect to the UDP.
By contrast Sinn Fe'in, the political wing of the IRA won 10 per cent of the
vote in the last elections and has almost 50 representatives on the
province's 26 district councils.
Five of the 10 loyalists at the talks in Stormont, the former parliament
outside Belfast, have served prison sentences for terrorist crimes. A sixth
was interned in the early 1970s.
The PUP's Mr David Ervine, who once served a prison sentence for possession
of explosives, has been the most visible loyalist leader since the Loyalist
United Military Command announced a ceasefire on October 13.
He has pioneered the idea that the loyalists must talk to Sinn Fein at some
stage and has tried to distance the PUP from the constitutional unionist
parties.
There was surprise that he did not lead the PUP delegation yesterday. This
task fell to Mr Billy Hutchinson, who served 15 years of a life sentence for
the murder of two Roman Catholics in Belfast's Falls Road in 1974. Having
renounced violence, he is now a community worker in the Shankill Road.
The other PUP delegates were Mr William Smith, Mr Jackie Mahood and Mr
Lyndsay Robb. Mr Smith, a 40-year-old former union representative at the
Harland and Wolff shipyard, was jailed for 10 years in 1972 for the
attempted murder of a Catholic in Belfast. He is now a community activist in
the Shankill area.
Mr Mahood served a prison sentence in the 1970s for attempted murder. Mr
Robb is the only member not have served a prison sentence.
The UDP delegation was led by Mr Gary McMichael, the only member of the
loyalist talks team who is an elected representative. The 25-year-old
councillor from Lisburn is the son of Mr John McMichael, a UDA leader who
was murdered by the IRA at Christmas 1987.
Mr John White was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of a
nationalist senator at Stormont in 1973. He is prisons spokesman for the
UDP.
Mr Tommy Kirkham, a former Democratic Unionist party councillor for
Newtonabbey, recently switched to the UDP because of his dissatisfaction
with the DUP leadership.
Little is known of the other two UDP delegates. Mr David Adams, a
42-year-old father of three from Lisburn, has twice stood in council
elections. Mr Joe English was interned in the early 1970s and was part of a
six-man delegation which visited the US in October on behalf of the
loyalists.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Dudley defeat worst since war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dudley West by-election will go down as the worst Conservative defeat
since the second world war.
The 29 per cent swing against the Conservatives cut their share of the vote
to just 19 per cent from 48.8 per cent in the 1992 general election.
Labour's vote, by contrast, increased to 69 per cent from 40.7 per cent in
the general election, and from its 59.5 per cent share of the vote in the
constituency at the local elections in May.
The defeat reduces the government's notional majority in the Commons to 13,
including the nine Tories who lost or resigned the whip two weeks ago after
a parliamentary rebellion on UK contributions to the European Union.
However, the willingness of the rebels to continue to vote against the
government means that Mr John Major now leads an administration with an
effective overall minority of five votes.
Even more worrying for Mr Major, if this result was repeated in a general
election it would result in the loss of most Conservative seats in the
Commons - raising the prospect of a Canadian-style Tory wipe-out.
Mr David Butler, the leading psephologist, calculates that every
Conservative MP would be defeated on a uniform national swing of 25 per
cent. Even a 20 per cent swing would defeat all but 12 Tories.
The swing last night will be a severe blow to ministers, whose authority has
been battered by recent revolts on value added tax and fishing policy, and
by the struggle to cope with a deep split on Europe.
Although lower than the record anti-Conservative swing of 35 per cent at
Christchurch, won by the Liberal Democrats in July 1983, it equalled
Labour's second-highest ever swing.
The victory was in the same league as the famous inter-war Labour victories
at Liverpool Wavertree in 1935 and Fulham East in 1933, when the party
achieved swings of 30 per cent and 29 per cent respectively.
It significantly bettered the 21.5 per cent swing at Mid-Staffs in March
1990 - the biggest shift in support from the government to Labour in a
Tory-held seat since the Conservatives returned to power in 1979.
There were a few crumbs of comfort for the government. The scale of the
defeat was undoubtedly reduced by the low turnout, which fell to 47 per cent
from 82.1 per cent in the 1992 general election - probably with
disillusioned Tories staying at home.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Insurers, advisers warned on pensions advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life companies and independent advisers will face disciplinary action if
they fail to carry out the regulators' plans for identifying and
compensating victims of poor advice on buying personal pensions, if
proposals put forward yesterday go ahead, Alison Smith writes.
The Personal Investment Authority, the watchdog to protect the private
investor, intends to change its rules so that anyone it regulates who does
not follow the procedures on time will be in breach of its requirements.
A consultation paper from the regulator also suggests relaxing the rules
imposing strict limits on the benefits life offices can give independent
advisers. In October a blueprint for reviewing the hundreds of thousands of
personal pensions sold since 1988 was set out by the Securities and
Investments Board, the City's chief regulator.
Its plan was drawn up after a detailed study found that poor advice had been
given during the selling of personal pensions on a far greater scale than
had previously been thought.
The PIA has set up a pensions unit which will handle cases where the adviser

through fees paid by all PIA member companies, with the rest falling on
companies which sold personal pensions through independent advisers.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Government may face rebellion over pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's government could face another rebellion from its
backbenchers early in the new year amid signs that Conservative MPs are
demanding better treatment for more than 400,000 British pensioners who live
overseas.
Little more than a week after a Commons rebellion forced the government to
abandon an increase in value added tax on domestic fuel, ministers are
coming under pressure to grant substantial improvements in payments to
pensioners living outside the European Union.
The pressure on the government is being orchestrated by Mr Winston
Churchill, the conservative MP for Davyhulme, who yesterday tabled an early
day motion demanding that the pensions of overseas residents should be
raised in line with those of domestic recipients.
About 150 MPs from all parties have put their names to the motion, which
calls for an 'end to discrimination against the hero generation who saved
the world from Hitler'. More than half of the signatories are Tory MPs.
Last night one of the Conservatives sponsoring the motion said MPs were
ready to introduce an amendment on the issue in the debate on the
government's pension bill, which is due to be published today. The MP said
there was 'some talk' about the government making concessions to the MPs to
ensure that a rebellion did not take place.
However, the Department of Social Security made clear last night that an
upgrading could cost the state an additional Pounds 230m a year in social
security spending.
The department said: 'The idea that we will make concessions is pure
speculation and we have made no announcement.'
Sir Andrew Bowden, the Conservative MP for Brighton Kemptown who is one of
the signatories, said yesterday that it was 'a gross injustice' that
pensioners had no increase in benefits while they were living abroad.
'I don't think it is reasonable to expect the government to make the
concessions all at once, but they should acknowledge the principle that it
was wrong not to upgrade.'

FT  16 DEC 94 / Life insurer to pay record penalty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK life insurance subsidiary of Irish Life will have to pay a record
amount in fines and costs totalling Pounds 385,000 for widespread failures
in training, recruitment and monitoring of staff.
The Pounds 300,000 fine equals the record penalty imposed by Lautro, the
self-regulating body for life insurers which has been superseded by the
Personal Investment Authority. Norwich Union and Premium Life were fined the
same amount in April.
Lautro also told Irish Life Assurance to pay its costs of Pounds 85,000. The
company has paid more than Pounds 135,000 compensation to 86 investors.
The first set of charges relates to inadequate monitoring and compliance of
the sales force and 'tied' agents authorised to sell ILA products only from
March 1991 to the end of last year. The second charge relates to failures
involving the company's training and competence scheme.
The regulator said that although it had approved the scheme early in 1992,
assessment visits to the company in spring this year revealed that it had
not been fully put into practice.
Irish Life says it is committed to the UK market. Last month, a
re-organisation of the group brought the Irish and UK retail businesses into
a single unit instead of the UK business being run as part of its European
operations.
Mr David Kingston, managing director, said the move would 'underpin our
strategic repositioning in the UK market'.
The UK life sector as a whole is facing increasing costs in order to meet
rising regulatory standards.
At the same time, levels of new business have been hit by public concern
about standards of selling in the industry.
For the six months to the end of June, Irish Life's total new business in
the UK fell by 37 per cent to IPounds 13.2m (Pounds 13m).

FT  16 DEC 94 / Peace seen to boost property market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Northern Ireland peace process has already brought heightened interest
in retail property in the province, with Belfast and the border towns
expected to gain most, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said
yesterday.
Research by the University of Ulster found property and construction
companies were also expecting housebuilding and sales to benefit. The peace
process was expected to bring greater mobility and more religious mixing in
private housing areas.
A rise in cross-border economic activity is also predicted, with the
Belfast-Dublin corridor likely to be the focus of development.
However, local companies anticipate intense competition as companies from
the rest of the UK move into the province.
Mr Denis Rooney, head of the institution working party, said: 'Our report
identifies tourism in particular as offering enormous potential for economic
growth provided the right infrastructure is developed. That means new hotels
and other facilities as well as communications services.'

FT  16 DEC 94 / Major in row over early recess
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An intended goodwill gesture turned sour on Mr John Major, the prime
minister, yesterday when he was accused of bringing forward the Christmas
parliamentary recess to dodge a political roasting in the Commons.
In a rare display of public anger, the prime minister vigorously denied that
his decision to engage in a tactical retreat was responsible for MPs
starting their Christmas break on Tuesday instead of Wednesday.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow leader of the Commons, said the scrapping of the
business originally planned for Tuesday would enable the prime minister to
escape a testing question time session.
Mr Major was further angered by her suggestion that he was resigned to the
loss of the Dudley West by-election and wanted to deprive Mr Ian Pearson,
the Labour candidate, of a high-profile introduction to the Commons on
Tuesday.
After an animated conversation with the prime minister, Mr Tony Newton,
leader of the Commons, said MPs ought to know that the recess had been
brought forward a day in response to a request from the office of Mr Tony
Blair, the Labour leader.
To Tory cheers, Mr Newton called on Mrs Taylor to apologise to the prime
minister 'for the comments you made'.
Mr Tony Banks, Labour MP for Newham north west, scornfully called for a
debate on the health of the prime minister. Backed by Labour cheers and
laughter, Mr Banks said: 'If he is going to get out of his pram like he did
just now in response to Mrs Taylor's question he is going to do himself a
mischief.'
Mr Newton replied that the prime minister showed 'every sign of being and
continuing in vigorous health'.
He said it was not surprising, in the circumstances, that Mr Major had been
'cross' about Mrs Taylor's suggestions.
After hurried consultations with other members of the Labour front bench Mrs
Taylor insisted that Mr Blair had not requested an earlier start for the
Christmas recess.
She pressed for the reinstatement of prime minister's questions and the
other business planned for Tuesday.
Mr Newton admitted in conciliatory tones that there could have been a
misunderstanding.
'Manifestly the impression had been created in Mr Major's office that
something approaching a request had been made,' he said.

FT  16 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Sutherland warns over growing recourse to
anti-dumping actions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, yesterday warned that the
achievements of the Uruguay Round global trade accords could unravel if
governments abused fair trade rules to protect special interests.
In a review of developments in the trading system since spring 1993, Mr
Sutherland said confidence in the new system depended on a willingness to
abide 'by the letter and spirit' of the World Trade Organisation, which
succeeds the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next month.
Nearly 60 of Gatt's 125 members have now ratified the WTO accords and Mr
Sutherland is predicting that up to 100 nations will be WTO members from
January 1.
Presenting the review to Gatt's governing council yesterday, Mr Sutherland
urged 'judicious use' of countries' room for manoeuvre in implementing the
Uruguay Round accords in order not to erode the benefits for world trade.
His anxieties, and those of many Gatt members, centre on the growing use of
anti-dumping actions to keep out cheap imports, and the proliferation of
regional trade groupings. Though both are permissible in principle under
international trade rules, they are increasingly seen as stretching those
rules to the limit and beyond.
Of 91 requests for consultations between 1989 and 1994, the first step in
Gatt's disputes settlement procedure, a quarter related to anti-dumping
actions, the report notes. This partly reflects the rising numbers of such
actions and partly 'an increasingly wide gap in perceptions of the
acceptable limits of actions'.
After a peak of 251 cases in 1992-93, the number of anti-dumping
investigations launched by the 25 members of Gatt's anti-dumping code
dropped back to 226 in 1993-94. However, this drop mainly reflected the
earlier surge in suits brought by US and Canadian steel producers.
Investigations initiated by the European Union and Brazil have risen
sharply, leaving the EU and the US joint 'leaders' in 1993-94 with 47 cases
each, followed by Australia and Brazil. The US had by far the largest number
of anti-dumping measures in force - 306 in June 1994, up from 279 a year
earlier - while the EU came second with 157, down from 185 the previous
year.
However, the report points out that the most frequent users of anti-dumping
actions are also frequent targets. EU companies head the list (89 cases in
the two years to mid-1994), with almost half the cases concerning Germany
and France. China was the biggest single country subject to investigation
(58 cases), followed by the US (45). The last couple of years have also seen
more anti-dumping suits against imports from eastern Europe, notably Russia
and Ukraine.
The Gatt report says 11 new regional trading arrangements - all in Europe -
were notified to Gatt between April 1993 and November 1994, bringing to 40
the total notified over the past five years.
It is generally admitted that Gatt's procedures for examining the
consistency of free trade pacts with fair trade rules are inadequate.
Virtually none of the working parties set up to examine regional trade
arrangements has been able to agree on their Gatt conformity.

FT  16 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Four nations sign up to Mercosur customs
union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OURO PRETO, SOUTHERN BRAZIL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The four member countries in the Mercosur customs union, launched in 1991,
yesterday began a final meeting setting the seal on the formal establishment
of the trade area on January 1.
Foreign ministers from Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay met in the
southern Brazilian town of Ouro Preto, a colonial gold mining centre, to
agree final details about the customs union. The four presidents are due
tomorrow to sign the Protocol of Ouro Preto, which will put the union into
effect and spell out the workings of Mercosur institutions including
procedures such as appeals.
Ministers are also negotiating final lists of products to be exempted from
the free trade area within the four countries, and also from the common
external tariffs (CET) of 0-20 per cent on imports from outside the union.
Mr Jose Artur Denot Medeiros, Brazil's main Mercosur negotiator, said
between 5 and 10 per cent of total trade would retain domestic tariffs for a
further four years to give uncompetitive industries more time to prepare for
customs union. Tariffs would be retained to protect such items as Argentine
paper and Brazilian processed fruit, but will be phased out according to
pre-arranged timetables.
A further 10 per cent of items, mainly sensitive products such as high
technology and capital goods, will not adopt the CET until early next
century. This is designed to help Brazilian companies which are currently
protected by tariffs of 20-35 per cent. Brazil's tariffs will fall, again by
a pre-arranged timetable, to meet the CET of 14-16 per cent for these
sectors.
Brazil and Argentina, which account for more than 95 per cent of Mercosur's
GDP, are also expected to announce details of a package of compromises to
help Argentine wheat compete in Brazil against subsidised exports from North
America. The two countries are also due to approve closer integration
between their two car industries.
Mercosur has led to a rapid increase in trade between the four countries as
tariff and other barriers have been progressively removed. Trade within the
four partners increased from Dollars 3.6bn in 1990 to Dollars 8.7bn last
year. Despite the success of the venture, Brazil and Argentina now want to
consolidate recent gains rather than push for a full common market.
Decisions will continue to be taken by the four countries' governments and
there are no plans to set up a European-style Commission. Brazilian and
Argentine fears about diminished sovereignty snuffed out a Uruguayan
proposal for a supranational court to rule on trade disputes. Instead, the
four countries are expected to announce a complaints process with final
appeal to a previously established, but so far untested, arbitration
tribunal.
Leaders are expected to discuss in detail Mercosur's role within the Free
Trade Area of the Americas, which all American leaders except Cuba last
weekend agreed to set up by 2005 at last week's Summit of the Americas in
Miami. Mercosur has already invited Chile and Bolivia to join as free trade
rather than customs unions members, and both countries will attend the Ouro
Preto summit as observers.

<TEXT>
Non-Japanese semiconductor manufacturers gained a record 23.2 per cent of
the Japanese chip market in the third quarter, up from 18.1 per cent in the
same period last year, US and Japanese government officials reported
yesterday. The rise should help defuse tensions between Washington and Tokyo
over the long-running chip trade battle. In previous trade agreements, the
US and Japan agreed to a target 20 per cent foreign share of Japan's market
for semiconductor products. Before the first agreement in 1986, the foreign
share stood at 8.5 per cent.
Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, welcomed the increase in foreign
market share calling it a 'a very positive development' that showed the
success of a results-oriented agreement but he warned against 'backsliding'.
The Japanese market, which accounts for about one third of world chip sales,
is expected to be worth almost Dollars 30bn this year, according to industry
statistics. 'There is no doubt that the trade agreements have produced
results,' said Mr Andrew Procassini, president of the Semiconductor Industry
Association, a US industry trade group.

FT  16 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Dollars 15bn Russian oil project in danger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Dollars 15bn project to develop the Timan Pechora oil basin in Russia's
Arctic circle is in jeopardy following last-minute demands by the Russian
partner for a 50 per cent equity stake.
The western consortium, consisting of Texaco, Exxon, Amoco and Norsk Hydro,
overcame a series of legal and fiscal obstacles and had intended to sign a
protocol agreement this week in the presence of Mr Al Gore, US
vice-president, who is in Moscow to promote trade links between the two
countries. 'This is now the only stumbling block to the deal,' said Mr
Thomas Hazen, president of the Timan Pechora company, who has been
negotiating the project for the past four years.
The consortium would have signed a production-sharing agreement to act as
contractors to the Russian government. Moscow would have retained all
ownership rights to the reserves and received about half of the project's
cash flow in taxes, royalties and profit-sharing. The consortium expected to
spend about Dollars 15bn over the next 12-15 years developing the region.
Archangelskgeologia, the local geological company which discovered the
reserves, estimates there may be as much as 5bn barrels of oil in Timan
Pechora.
But Archangelskgeologia, a government-owned company, has now demanded a 50
per cent equity stake in the project. A company spokesman was quoted in a
local newspaper as saying: 'We are not some kind of Indonesia or Angola - we
do not need to give such a project entirely to foreigners.'
Under the original proposal it would have served as a non-equity contractor
to the western consortium. Part of the appeal of Timan Pechora for western
companies had been the absence of a powerful local oil industry, such as
that found in western Siberia, Russia's main oil region.
Mr Hazen said Archangelskgeologia was not 'financially qualified' to assume
a prominent role - given it did not even have enough money to pay its
workers - and even if it were 'it would take away half of our interest'.
Under the original proposals, Texaco and Exxon would each have had a 30 per
cent stake in the project with Amoco and Norsk Hydro each owning a 20 per
cent share. The partners would have invested funds in proportion to their
equity interest.
Mr Hazen said the project had firm support from the upper reaches of the
Russian government. 'I am confident that this problem can be resolved but
this is a Russian problem which needs a Russian solution,' he said.
Disputes between regions and the central authorities in Moscow over
ownership of oil reserves have been one of the main impediments to new oil
developments in Russia.
The Timan Pechora region is seen as one of the most promising oil fields in
Russia. Nine western companies and four Russian companies are currently
discussing a feasibility study to build an offshore terminal to provide a
direct link to export markets. This would involve another Dollars 2bn of
investment.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Republicans damn Clinton tax cut plans: Right wingers defy
him to outbid them as defenders of middle class
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Republican leaders yesterday took pre-emptive aim at President Bill
Clinton's proposals for a middle class tax cut, dismissing them as
inadequate even before they had been made. Mr Clinton last night sought to
revive his political popularity in a televised speech which included
proposals for tax cuts of about Dollars 60bn (Pounds 38.4bn) over five
years.
Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican who has already announced his
intention to challenge Mr Clinton for the presidency in 1996, said yesterday
that the president was 'more than a day late and more than a dollar short'.
Mr Gramm said that the lower limit for a tax cut was the figure of Dollars
107bn promised in the contract with America manifesto, on which most
Republicans in the House of Representatives campaigned in the November
elections.
'I am not going to support a tax cut for families that short-changes them,
and the president's proposal is going to be a non-starter unless it at least
meets the level that has been set by the House of Representatives,' Mr Gramm
said. Mr Haley Barbour, Republican National Committee chairman, said Mr
Clinton was trying to jump on the tax cut train after it had left the
station.
Mr Clinton's package would allow income tax credits for families with
children, but with a lower income ceiling than the Dollars 200,000 proposed
by some Republicans. One of the tax credits would be to help offset college
tuition fees.
In his search for ways to pay for tax cuts, Mr Clinton has lately examined a
range of options, some as radical as abolishing entire government
departments, such as Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or Transportation.
Republicans warned Mr Clinton, however, that in a poker game over who could
propose the biggest tax cut and the largest reduction in government, they
would outbid him.
'We will see him a tax cut and HUD, and raise him Education and Energy,'
said Mr Edwin Feulner, president of the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing
Washington think-tank.
But fiscal conservatives are alarmed at the tax cut bidding war now in
progress.
'Don't buy this pig in a poke. It may feel good in the short term, but it's
not going to feel good in the long term,' said Senator Bob Kerrey, a
Nebraska Democrat who chaired a bipartisan commission appointed to consider
long-term reforms to bring the government's finances into balance.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Cardoso on his mark for a reforming sprint: The Brazilian
president-elect is clear about his policy priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's Senate gave an effusive farewell on Wednesday to Mr Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, who is to become the country's next president on January
1. If he pursues the policies needed to modernise the Brazilian state, and
which are sure to be unpopular, it may be some time before he is invited
back.
Mr Cardoso used the occasion to make a wide-ranging speech listing the
priorities for his four-year term in office. Rather than grandiose visions,
he concentrated on reforms he needs to tackle during the first few months.
'Brazil is in a hurry. We have only a limited period to take the measures to
guarantee stability and prepare for a new cycle of development,' he said.
Mr Cardoso's haste is prompted by time bombs within the government budget
and social security system. Both threaten the success of the Real currency
which Mr Cardoso planned when he was finance minister. The currency reduced
monthly inflation from about 50 per cent before its July launch to 2-3 per
cent today and its success ensured Mr Cardoso's election victory.
The Real worked partly because the government has this year balanced its
budget, mainly by severe spending cuts. Next year, however, the government
is forecasting a deficit of Dollars 5bn-Dollars 10bn (Pounds 3.2bn-Pounds
6.4bn), equal to 1-2 per cent of GDP and enough to prompt worries about
inflation. Meanwhile, Brazil's badly designed social security system, which
will soon have more beneficiaries than contributors, is set to cost Dollars
28bn in 1995, against just Dollars 14.2bn three years ago.
In his speech Mr Cardoso highlighted three areas for reform, all requiring
constitutional changes. He said the central government's responsibilities,
and spending obligations, needed to be devolved to local government and the
private sector; government revenues needed to be raised by an overhaul of
the tax system; and the social security system had to be reformed to remove
anomalies and lax rules.
None of these ideas is new, and there is widespread agreement in Congress
and the business sector that reform, in general terms, is needed. The
problem, however, and the reason why change has not yet happened, is that
specific proposals proved unpopular and often threatened big losses for
powerful interest groups.
Mr Cardoso, a cautious man who likes to build consensus before acting, took
care in his Senate speech not to mention any unpopular measures. Talking
about tax reform, he stressed the need to cut taxes on exports and basic
goods for poorer families. He did not dwell on his probable need to lift the
overall tax burden from 25 per cent of GDP, which is low by international
standards.
He said he would send specific ideas on constitutional reform to Congress in
February. Any changes would need three fifths approval; Mr Cardoso so far
looks capable of mustering the support.
His Social Democracy party (PSDB) and its allies have just under half the
seats in Congress, and earlier this week he won the backing of the
Democratic Movement (PMDB), Brazil's biggest political party. But until Mr
Cardoso takes office and spells out his plans, it is difficult to assess the
loyalty of his allies.
'He will have two to three months' honeymoon, then it will get difficult,'
Mr Luiz Pedone of the University of Braslia predicts. 'There will be strong
opposition, including from some of the government's backers, on
controversial reforms like reducing the central government's spending
obligations and the size of the public sector.'
The reforms Mr Cardoso is seeking will take time to affect significantly the
government's budget and will not start reducing its spending obligations
until 1996 at the earliest. Next year's deficit will probably have to be
covered by privatisation receipts.
Mr Cardoso said Brazil's privatisation programme, which has lagged behind
those of neighbours such as Argentina, needed to be 'accelerated and
extended' to energy, transport, telecoms and mining.
Departing from his prepared text, he spoke of how impressed he was by US
telecommunications technology on a recent visit to Miami. Brazil's telecoms'
monopoly - which has suffered from a lack of competition and government
under-investment - needed to be made more 'flexible' or be left behind, he
said.
These signals, which will be welcomed by foreign companies eyeing Brazil's
telecoms market, suggest Mr Cardoso's cautious conversion to privatisation
is continuing. However, he stressed the state need not lose control of its
monopoly, and he did not mention the state-owned oil monopoly Petrobras.
Persuading Congress to back speedier privatisation will also be difficult.
State-owned companies are still seen by many politicians as sources of
patronage.
A member of the outgoing government said Mr Cardoso's popularity when he
took office would give him clout to make many of the changes he needed, but
only if inflation stayed below 2-3 per cent a month and people continued to
feel better off.
'The first half of next year will be crucial for approving these reforms.
The danger is the new government will spend too long trying to reach
compromise solutions with interest groups which stand to lose out, and the
door will close.'

FT  16 DEC 94 / Strike impasse dashes hopes for a new start to baseball
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Negotiations to resolve the baseball players' strike that cut last season
short have broken down, greatly reducing the chances that the sport will
start again next spring in anything approximating its current major league
form.
Owners of the 28 teams, meeting in Chicago late yesterday, were expected to
declare an impasse in the talks, a legal device under labour relations law
that would enable them unilaterally to impose a cap on player salaries.
The players' union is likely to counter with a lawsuit accusing management
of failing to bargain in good faith. This would lead to an investigation by
the National Labour Relations Board, the independent federal agency, which
could last two months.
The NLRB has already sided with the players on a related issue by announcing
that it has filed a complaint that the owners improperly withheld Dollars
7.8m (Pounds 5m) in contributions to the players' pension fund due on August
1, less than two weeks before the strike started.
Last week the department of Labour certified the dispute as official, thus
clearing the way for the union to petition the government not to grant visas
to non-American players, mostly from Latin America, whom the owners have
threatened to import as substitutes, along with minor league players, in an
attempt to get some kind of season under way next year.
There had been some hope earlier this week that the latest round of
negotiations was making progress on alternatives to a pure salary cap as the
best means of sharing revenues more equitably between rich and poor clubs.
Modified proposals by the owners on taxing team payrolls had not been
dismissed out of hand by the players, but no agreement proved possible.
With spring training due to start in 10 weeks, there has been no break in
player solidarity, though public opinion now tends to blame them more than
the owners for the problems of the country's national sport. Some owners
have expressed misgivings about sacrificing another season, but the majority
seem determined to let the confrontation run its course.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Mexico raises privatisation revenue targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico is to embark on an ambitious new privatisation and foreign borrowing
programme designed to raise Dollars 5.5bn (3.5bn) in 1995, according to Mr
Jaime Serra Puche, the new finance minister.
The funds will be used to stimulate infrastructure investment and help
finance the country's large current account deficit.
Mr Serra said in an interview this week immediate candidates for
privatisation are the high-volume Mexico City-Queretaro and Mexico
City-Puebla toll roads and the country's ports. Significant revenues will
also come from the fees charged to new entrants in the long-distance
telephone service market when the former state-owned telephone company
Telmex is stripped of its monopoly status in January of 1997.
Although Mr Serra stopped short of designating the country's rail system and
secondary petrochemical plants among other state-owned industries to be sold
off, these sectors are expected to be included in the new privatisation
list. This would allow the Mexican government to reach its stated revenue
target without being forced to achieve the Dollars 5bn foreign borrowing
limit it has set for itself in 1995.
Privatisation of the railways would almost certainly require a
constitutional amendment, while the regulatory framework for petrochemical
privatisation already exists.
Funds raised from privatisation and other one-time revenues, together with
foreign borrowing by government entities, will be used to provide financing
guarantees and/or risk capital for private infrastructure projects. Export
promotion programs would also be targeted with these new revenues in an
attempt to reduce Mexico's trade deficit, which in the first nine months of
1994 grew by 31.9 per cent over the same period last year.
Mr Serra also acknowledged that privatisation and other structural reforms
had additional motives. He said the moves willsignal that Mexico was going
forward with the sort of reforms that would strengthen the confidence of
foreign investors in the country and lead to more capital inflows.
Most analysts consider securing sufficient foreign capital to be Mexico's
biggest macroeconomic challenge in the coming year. The government is
forecasting a current account deficit of 7.8 per cent of GDP, or
approximately Dollars 30.5bn, a slight increase over 1994's estimate of 7.6
per cent and Dollars 29bn respectively. This year capital inflows fell short
by some Dollars 7bn, causing a corresponding drop in international reserves,
which now stand in the neighbourhood of Dollars 17bn.
Mr Serra rejected a similar fall in reserves during 1995, arguing that if
capital inflows were to slow down so would the economy and imports. At the
same time, however, he did acknowledge that this was a long-run relationship
and there could be a short-term gap between the supply of foreign capital
and demand for foreign goods, as happened in 1994.
'The reserves exist to cover this gap,' said Mr Serra, rejecting time and
time again in the interview that the way to soften a possible shortfall in
the capital account was via a devaluation in the peso.
Were such a gap to repeat itself in 1995, Mr Serra said that although 'we're
not going to mess with the markets,' he would rather see interest rates
raised before he would agree to a one-off devaluation of the peso or an
increase in the daily depreciation of the exchange rate band.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Turbo-prop safety fears put off the passengers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Short-hop flights on small commuter aircraft are big business in the US:
there are more than 12,500 a day. But many passengers dislike the
propellor-powered aircraft typically used on these flights - and may be even
less keen to use them after this week's fatal accident in North Carolina.
On Tuesday evening a turbo-prop BAe Jetstream Super 31 on an American Eagle
commuter flight crashed into a wood on its final approach into
Raleigh-Durham International Airport, killing 15 of the 20 passengers. The
cause is not yet known.
The accident came less than two months after another American Eagle
turbo-prop, an ATR-72, went down while waiting to land at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport, killing all 68 on board. Ice on the wings is the
suspected cause.
The accidents themselves would have been enough to make some passengers
jittery about flying by turbo-prop aircraft. But last month, they were given
another reason to feel nervous when the International Airline Passengers
Association, a Washington-based consumer organisation, said people should
fly by propellor-driven aircraft only in good weather during daylight hours
to minimise the chance of accidents.
Further anxiety was caused last weekend when the Federal Aviation
Administration banned the ATR-72 and ATR-42 turbo-prop aircraft from flying
in icy conditions, causing widespread flight cancellations in the
north-eastern US.
Turbo-prop aircraft are disliked by many passengers because they tend to be
slower, noisier and more cramped than jets. But their use is growing in the
US because they provide the most economical means of picking up small
numbers of passengers from local communities and feeding them into
longer-distance flights at regional hubs.
As big airlines face increasing competition from low-cost carriers, they are
replacing jets with turbo-props on some routes. Earlier this year, for
example, American Airlines replaced all its jet services in Cincinnati with
turbo-prop flights.
To some extent, the safety fears associated with turbo-prop aircraft are
justified. Statistics show that, on US domestic flights, regional airlines
suffered 0.11 fatal accidents per 100,000 flights last year - more than
three times the rate of 0.029 suffered by the big carriers.
Some of the reasons cited for the difference include less rigorous training
standards for pilots of small aircraft, less sophisticated avionics gear,
less effective de-icing gear, and vulnerability to bad weather because small
aircraft tend to fly at lower altitudes.
However, the Regional Airline Association, a US industry body, says the
safety fears are overdone. Excluding Alaska, where operating conditions are
particularly difficult, it says that the accident rate for regional airlines
falls to 0.037 fatal accidents per 100,000 flights - not that much higher
than the figure for big carriers.
Still, Ms Deborah McElroy, the association's vice president, says it would
be naive to believe that the safety concerns are not having some effect on
passenger numbers. 'You read in the papers that some people are driving
rather than taking a turbo-prop aircraft, which is ironic since it's nearly
100 times safer to use a regional airline than it is to make the same trip
by car.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela's banking crisis this week claimed another victim, as the
government took over the Grupo Latinoamericano, a conglomerate of 43
financial and other companies, because of troubles at the two banks it
owned.
The two banks in the group controlled by Mr Orlando Castro - Republica and
Progreso - will continue operating. They were taken over following the
failure to service loans made earlier this year by government agencies in an
attempt to prop up the bank and, more recently, settlement difficulties. The
group 'had a liquidity problem and a solvency problem,' according to Finance
Minister Julio Sosa.
The takeover means the state now owns about 70 per cent of the banking
system, following a crisis which erupted at the start of the year.
Ironically, the first bank to go under - Banco Latino - reopened its doors
this week, as did its Edge Act subsidiary in Miami.
Mr Sosa said in an interview that he believed the crisis was drawing to a
close. 'I think we are more or less getting to the end of it. People now
realise that their deposits are OK.' Government policy now is to keep the
banks operating.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Nigeria under pressure to scrap economic controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS and MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A team from the International Monetary Fund has completed talks this week in
Abuja with Nigeria's finance ministry less than three weeks before the
military regime is due to review economic policy in the 1995 budget.
General Sani Abacha, head of state, is under pressure from investors and
official creditors to scrap the economic controls imposed in January and
deal with the Dollars 8bn arrears in debt service to the Paris Club.
Since early 1992 Nigeria has not serviced its debt to the Paris Club, which
accounts for more than half its Dollars 28bn external debt. Nigeria needs
some form of agreement with the IMF and a few months' good track record to
gain external debt relief and unlock international finance for planned gas
export projects.
The fund is looking for significant steps to deregulate foreign exchange and
interest rate policy, cut the budget deficit and account for all oil
revenue. There is also continued concern about the estimated 150,000 barrels
a day of oil revenue that goes into offshore dedication accounts under the
supervision of the presidency and which never enters the government's books.
The Nigerian government is being urged to curb uneconomic capital projects
and recurrent spending and to find more revenue.
Although the government forecast a balanced budget in 1994, economists
believe the budget deficit this year will be more than Dollars 4bn, which is
nearly 100 per cent of forecast expenditure and about 14 per cent of gross
domestic product, despite the failure to meet commitments to supply foreign
exchange to industry and the underfunding of joint ventures in oil
production.
There have been conflicting signals about the government's intentions,
particularly over the most contentious issue - foreign exchange policy. Some
finance ministry officials and the Central Bank of Nigeria argue for
deregulation. But Mr Aminu Saleh, a leading figure in the government,
recently ruled out deregulation.
Michael Holman, Africa Editor, adds: In an unprecedented attempt to crack
down on the country's black market in foreign currency and reinforce its
controversial exchange rate policy, Nigeria's military government has made
it an offence to disclose the street value of the naira.
In a decree issued last week, the authorities warned that to 'publish or
cause to be published exchange rates and interest rates other than that
approved by the Central Bank' would be an offence.
The penalty for individuals breaching the decree is a fine of N100,000
(Pounds 2,900 or Dollars 4,500) or two years' imprisonment, or both.
In January the government pegged the foreign exchange rate at N22 to the
dollar and closed the secondary or parallel market which allowed investors
to bring in and change dollars at the open market rate, which was between
N45 and N50 earlier this year.
The government also capped bank lending rates at 21 per cent. Privately the
government admits the measures have failed, with inflation rising to over
100 per cent on an annual basis, and the market rate of the Naira plunging
from N50 to N100 between June and November this year as receipts from the
country's exports failed to keep up with the demand for foreign currency.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Shift from protest to power tests ANC: Party confronts
challenges its founders would have been pleased to face
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the official launch of his autobiography in Johannesburg last week, South
African President Nelson Mandela joked that such were the rigours of his
office that he sometimes longed for the relative calm of prison.
As his African National Congress gathers tomorrow in the Afrikaner city of
Bloemfontein for its first national conference since winning the April
election, it is a sentiment that will be appreciated by the 3,000 delegates
 -the transformation from liberation movement to government is proving much
more demanding, and the social and economic fruits of political victory far
more elusive, than expected.
Nevertheless, it is a task which Mr Mandela and his party are undertaking
with vigour as they celebrate the fulfilment a dream first articulated in
1912, in the same conservative town, when a small group of black men
gathered to form an organisation that would fight their disenfranchisement
in the newly established country of South Africa.
Eighty-three years after its foundation, having weathered decades of the
imprisonment, torture, exile and murder of its members at the hands of the
white government, the ANC will be hoping to emerge from its first
post-apartheid conference with a united front and shared vision for the new
era.
Although Mr Mandela's popularity among blacks remains at levels other heads
of government can only dream of, and is growing steadily among other race
groups, the ANC as a party is losing ground.
Paid-up membership has fallen off sharply since April, contributing to a
budget crunch that has forced the retrenchment of a large number of party
officers.
More seriously, while black expectations were never as unrealistic as whites
feared, the government's failure to begin implementing its much-vaunted jobs
and housing programmes has led to an upsurge in grassroots dissatisfaction -
with the result that opinion polls show the ANC's national support has
dropped from 60.6 per cent in April to 53.6 per cent in September.
Part of the problem is that members of the new national and regional
parliaments are finding that their experiences in the protest movement are
of limited use when trying to draft and implement legislation. As Mr Tokyo
Sexwale, premier of the Gauteng region, the country's most powerful
province, asked rhetorically last month: 'Are we in power or just in
office?'
The primary theme of the conference - 'From Resistance to Reconstruction and
Nation Building' - reflects this concern. It is a theme which acknowledges
the ANC's inability as yet to manage the transition to efficient
administration. It is also, however, a theme designed to appeal to the
party's core black constituency to try to offset disillusionment with what
some ANC members describe as the government's overly reconciliatory attitude
to whites.
In an official position paper for the conference, drafted last month, Mr
Thabo Mbeki, deputy president, called on the ANC to refocus its attention on
its mass base - 'the black working class, black rural poor and the
significant section of the black middle strata'. The government will be
hoping this Africanist rhetoric will be enough to defuse the radical
elements at the conference.
But there are other problems to be overcome, particularly concerning the
party's relationship with its traditional allies. Although the ANC remains
in formal alliance with the country's largest labour federation,
Cosatu, as the government it is now reluctant to condone strikes and
inflationary wage demands that a year ago it would have supported.
Similarly, while the civic associations which sprang up in the 1980s as
opposition movements to imposed local government structures are still
formally aligned to the ANC, the two groupings have clashed publicly (and
sometimes violently) on the issue of continued rent and service boycotts in
the black townships.
The government, desperately wanting extra revenue to fund development
projects, is insisting that residents resume payments or face eviction, a
stand the associations are unwilling to endorse.
Politicking within the ANC over who should hold senior party posts is
complicating the situation. Mr Mbeki remains the front runner to be elected
deputy president of the party in place of the ailing Mr Walter Sisulu, but
the occasion will also be an important gauge of support for his chief rival,
Mr Cyril Ramaphosa.
After his defeat in the fight for the deputy presidency of South Africa, Mr
Ramaphosa, who is the party's incumbent secretary-general, has kept a low
profile.
In recent months there has been speculation he may withdraw from politics,
perhaps accepting a job in the private sector. However, in the past few
weeks most of the ANC's regional groupings have voiced support for Mr
Ramaphosa, who now seems likely to retain his position.
But whatever tribulations the ANC-led government is forced to address, one
thought will be uppermost in the mind of every one of the delegates gathered
in Bloemfontein - they are challenges that the party's founders would have
been only too pleased, and proud, to face.

Zimbabwe will move to full current account convertibility from January 1
with the liberalisation of dividend remittances and regulations covering
domestic borrowing by foreign - owned companies. The changes, announced by
Mr John Nkomo, acting finance minister, mean that foreign companies, which
invested in Zimbabwe before May 1, 1993, will be permitted to remit 100 per
cent of after-tax profits instead of 50 per cent as at present.
The relaxation applies only to dividends declared after January 1 and puts
all foreign-owned companies on the same footing. In the past, only companies
that invested since May 1993 were entitled to full dividend remittability.
Latest figures show Zimbabwe's net foreign asset position has improved from
minus Dollars 470m a year ago to a positive Dollars 3m. The country now has
foreign exchange reserves covering eight months imports.

Philippine debt negotiators yesterday haggled with a visiting International

'tacit' agreement on increased monetary expansion ceilings in the country's
economic programme. The Philippine government wants to aim for a higher
overall economic growth target without being hemmed in by tight liquidity
and inflation ceilings. Mr Gabriel Singson, governor of the Bangko Sentral
ng Pilipinas, the country's central monetary authority, said the visiting
IMF team had agreed there will be some relaxation on monetary aggregates for
1995. However, Philippine panel member Mr Roberto de Ocampo, finance
secretary, earlier told journalists the IMF had asked for 'more evidence'
from government negotiators to support the request for new ceilings.

Big improvements in health, education and welfare mean that child mortality
in the developing world should fall by about 2.5m next year compared with
1990. The findings, in the latest review by the United Nations World
Children's Fund*, show that more than half the world's developing nations
are set to meet the ambitious targets put forward at the World Summit for
Children in 1990. The biggest advance has come in disorders involving iodine
deficiency, the world's single biggest cause of preventable mental
retardation. Almost 60 of the 94 affected countries are meeting the targets
to tackle iodine deficiency set in 1990, while a further 32 nations could do
so over the next 12 months. Substantial progress has been made in
eradicating polio, while deaths from measles, diarrhoea and pneumonia have
fallen abruptly.

A former senior civil servant in Kenya has been charged with conspiring to
steal Ks5.76bn (Pounds 82m) from the central bank in a move timed to
reassure a donors' meeting in Paris of the government's commitment to stamp
out corruption. Mr Wilfred Koinange, the powerful permanent secretary at the
treasury until his retirement in May, is the most senior government official
to be charged in connection with a series of financial scandals which robbed
the Exchequer of over Ks30bn last year - the biggest embezzlement of public
funds in Kenya's history. Mr Koinange denied the prosecution charges and has
been remanded in custody until his bail application is heard next week.
The International Monetary Fund is understood to have warned President
Daniel arap Moi that it would not sign a new loan agreement unless his
government took firm steps to bring wrongdoers to justice. Without the IMF's
seal of approval, neither the World Bank nor bilateral donors would be
likely to pledge more aid at the Consultative Group meeting in Paris today.
Kenya is seeking up to Dollars 800m (Pounds 512m) in aid for 1995.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Row over rescues may dog Japan bank chief: Matsushita takes
over as governor of central bank tomorrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tomorrow Mr Yasuo Matsushita will take office as the new governor of the
Bank of Japan. He moves in to the central bank at a delicate time in
Japanese financial history.
Money market interest rates are rising, despite an anaemic economic recovery
and chronically weak demand for money. But his immediate concern will be the
fragility of the nation's banking system, and especially a growing political
furore over the bank's handling of it.
The problems began last week with an announcement by the outgoing governor,
Mr Yasushi Mieno, of a rescue package for two of the country's smaller
credit associations.
The scheme - a lifeboat to be launched in February for the two institutions
 -looked innocuous enough. Tokyo Kyowa and Anzen, like many of their larger
peers, waded far too deep into the waters of the bubble economy of the late
1980s.
They now have bad debts of more than Y100bn (Pounds 638m) and are virtually
insolvent. So the bank announced a rescue operation, funded partly by itself
 -with capital of Y20bn - and partly by private sector institutions, to take
over the troubled companies and dispose of the bad debts.
But this week the decision was publicly denounced by one cabinet minister,
and two others appear to have expressed concerns about it. Mr Ryutaro
Hashimoto, the minister for international trade and industry, said the move
was a dangerous precedent.
What has upset ministers is that the rescue breaks with past practice. Two
years ago the ministry of finance, principally responsible for banking
supervision, floated the idea of a publicly funded body to take over the bad
debts of the banking system, along the lines of the Resolution Trust
Corporation in the US savings and loans collapse. But there was immediate
hostility from the public, and the plan was quietly shelved. There is still
fierce opposition among the Japanese public to the idea that bankers should
be rescued from their own folly by the use of public funds.
When institutions have been in danger of collapse in the past , the bank and
the MoF have twisted the arms of larger companies and persuaded them to put
up the necessary funding for the rescue.
In Japan's intertwined financial world, most of the smaller institutions
have close links with larger, better-capitalised companies. Only two months
ago, Mitsubishi Bank was persuaded to take control of the ailing Nippon
Trust Bank, which had been brought near to collapse by the same bad lending
problems.
But in recent months, the larger banks have been telling the MoF they can no
longer justify the burden of rescuing ailing affiliates, without some
assistance from the authorities. Hence, analysts believe, last week's
unprecedented measure.
But this leaves a further puzzle. Just six weeks ago Mr Mieno, in what was
widely billed as one of the most significant speeches of his governorship,
signalled what many saw as a shift in Japanese financial policy. He stated
in unequivocal terms for the first time that banks and financial
institutions that got into trouble could not expect to be rescued.
'It is not the business of the central bank to save all financial
institutions from failure,' he said. Only where there was clear evidence of
'systemic risk' arising from the failure of an institution should the
authorities feel the need to act. 'Should a failure have the potential to
undermine stability as a whole, then that potential must be removed.'
These sentiments would not be unusual from the mouths of other central bank
governors who have tried to parry criticism that they are too soft on banks.
But in Japan, where the it represented a significant departure, and was
widely flagged as such by BoJ officials.
Yet it is difficult to argue that the failure of Tokyo Kyowa and Anzen, with
their combined deposit base of a mere Y243bn, represents any kind of
systemic risk to Japan's admittedly fragile banking system.
So why has the Bank, at the first opportunity to demonstrate its new,
tougher policy, retreated from it so spectacularly?
Some suspect that the plan represents the triumph of old MoF philosophy. The
MoF is much more instinctively sympathetic to the proposition that bank
collapses threaten financial stability.
The financial crises of the 1920s and 1930s were more severe in Japan than
elsewhere and there are many in the MoF who believe that any threat of a
repeat, however small, should be avoided.
Those suspicions are enhanced by the arrival of Mr Matsushita. Unlike his
predecessor, the new man is a former MoF official and is thought likely to
take a less independent line than Mr Mieno.
But this theory ignores the fact that the rescue was announced by Mr Mieno
before the end of his term.
A more likely explanation is that both Bank and the MoF are mindful of the
continuing difficulties faced not by the likes of Kyowa and Anzen, but by
the larger banks.
One senior banker suggested yesterday that the surprising move is intended
to test the waters of public opinion for a support operation that really
will be needed to ensure systemic stability if, as is possible, a leading
bank comes close to failing in the next year or so.
Although the total level of bad loans has probably peaked, banks' prospects
of eliminating the problem quickly are not assisted by declining
profitability and weak lending demand. The risk of a serious setback remains
strong.
In the meantime the political row will intensify in the period before the
lifeboat is formally launched - not the ideal start for Mr Matsushita's
tenure. But if the larger banks' health does deteriorate in the next year,
the new governor's position will get a lot more uncomfortable.

Preliminary money supply figures published by the Bank of Japan yesterday
gave mixed signals about the state of liquidity in the Japanese economy,
writes Gerard Baker in Tokyo. The basic measure of the broad money stock
accelerated in November by 2.6 per cent on a year earlier, compared with an
annual growth rate of 2.4 per cent in October. On a monthly basis, the broad
money figure - M2 (cash in circulation plus sight and demand deposits) and
certificates of deposit - rose 0.2 per cent from October. But the rate of
growth of the broadest measure of liquidity slowed slightly. M2 plus CDs
plus postal savings deposits, government bonds and investment trusts grew by
3.5 per cent in November from a year earlier, compared with a preliminary
3.6 per cent rise a year ago.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Quitting lifts lid on Indian sugar industry: Probe fall-out
draws attention to highly regulated and corruption-prone sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Cabinet minister's resignation has cast an unwanted light into the murky
world of the highly regulated and corruption-prone Indian sugar industry.
The causes of the departure of Mr A K Antony, the civil supplies minister,
lie in the government's mishandling of a sugar shortage earlier this year
which forced the country to pay tens of millions of dollars more for
imported sugar than it might otherwise have done. Sugar producers and
traders, in India and abroad, made bumper profits at the expense of the
Indian government and of sugar consumers.
In June, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, ordered an inquiry into
the affair by Mr Gian Prakash, a retired civil servant, who presented his
findings in September. The prime minister at first refused to publish the
report. But this week, after the ruling Congress (I) party's defeats in the
recent state elections in which corruption was an important issue, Mr
Narasimha Rao responded to opposition party pressure and allowed a junior
minister to present a short written summary to parliament. This vaguely
apportioned blame to almost everyone involved in control of the sugar
industry.
The low-key note, which the prime minister presumably hoped would offend
no-one, outraged Mr Antony, a minister with a reputation for honesty, who
was furious at being bracketed with those he believes responsible for the
debacle.
Mr Antony's resignation has intensified the pressure on those who played a
bigger role in the scandal.
India is both the world's largest producer and consumer of sugar. To ensure
that even the poor can buy sugar, about half the output is sold through
government ration shops at artificially low prices. The rest is sold on a
so-called free market, although even here prices are influenced by the
government which regulates the volume of sugar reaching the stores. Entry
into the industry is controlled by the government which grants production
licences - a lucrative source of bribes.
All this intervention fails to eliminate periodic swings between gluts and
shortages. The first inkling of a shortage this year emerged last winter
when Mr Antony, whose ministry is in charge of food distribution, and Mr A C
Sen, the chief civil servant in the food ministry, warned Mr Kalpnath Rai,
the food minister, that imports were needed. Mr Rai rejected the advice at a
meeting in December of the Cabinet Committee on Prices, which controls
administered prices.
Because of other official business, the committee did not meet again until
March, when rising sugar prices in the domestic market had set alarm bells
ringing. Mr Rai finally conceded that the crop would be smaller than
expected. According to documents leaked to Indian newspapers, Mr Manmohan
Singh, the finance minister who chairs the committee, remarked drily that
sugar production estimates should be assessed independently since 'certain
parties had a vested interest in giving credence to unreliable estimates'.
The committee agreed to allow private imports of sugar and authorised the
state-owned trading corporations, STC and MMTC which are run by the commerce
ministry, to import 1m tonnes to top up the domestic output of 9.6m tonnes.
The first privately imported sugar arrived in mid-April but it was not until
the end of May before the government agencies made their purchases.
The purchases were delayed by arguments between the food, commerce and
finance ministries over who should pay for any losses suffered from buying
sugar at world prices and selling them at (lower) Indian prices. The delays
were compounded by an abortive attempt by the Food Corporation of India, a
third government agency, to make its own sugar imports - a move authorised
by Mr Sen, the food secretary, and blocked by Mr Rai.
As word of India's purchasing plans leaked into the international market, so
prices soared from about Dollars 290 a tonne in January to Dollars 360 by
June. The Indian government eventually imported 1m tonnes - if it could have
paid Dollars 50 a tonne less through more adept trading, it would have saved
Dollars 50m. Private traders imported a further 1m: some of them made a
killing by securing early contracts. Those who bought late actually lost
money since by the end of the summer prices were falling once more.
Once the panic to secure supplies had passed, the attention shifted to
apportioning blame. Under pressure from the opposition parties, the prime
minister ordered Mr Prakash's inquiry. Although it has not been published,
it seems to have exonerated the prime minister personally and spread blame
among other ministers and officials.
All those allegedly involved have denied they were at fault.
If Mr Narasimha Rao hoped that the sugar affair would gradually fade away
amid concern over more immediate issues such as last week's state election
results, Mr Antony's resignation will have soured his plans.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Nigeria's government attempt to thwart illegal currency
dealings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an unprecedented attempt to crack down on the country's black market in
foreign currency and reinforce its controversial exchange rate policy,
Nigeria's military government has made it an offence to disclose the street
value of the naira, Michael Holman, Africa Editor, writes.
In a decree issued last week, the authorities warned that to 'publish or
cause to be published exchange rates and interest rates other than that
approved by the Central Bank' would be an offence.
The penalty for individuals breaching the decree is a fine of N100,000
(Pounds 2,900 or Dollars 4,500) or two year imprisonment, or both.
In January the government pegged the foreign exchange rate at N22 to the
dollar and closed the secondary or parallel market which allowed investors
to bring in and change dollars at the open market rate, which was between
N45 and N50 earlier this year.
The government also capped bank lending rates at 21 per cent. Privately the
government admits the measures have failed, with inflation rising to more
than 100 per cent on an annual basis, and the market rate of the Naira
plunging from N50 to N100 between June and November this year as receipts
from the country's exports failed to keep up with the demand for foreign
currency.

<TEXT>
Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, last night seemed to be
preparing a cabinet reshuffle in an effort to win back public confidence
following the ruling Congress (I) party's defeat in state elections last
week.
Large numbers of ministers offered to resign yesterday in order to give Mr
Narasimha Rao a free hand in rebuilding his government.
The offers came amid persistent opposition attacks on alleged corruption and
incompetence in the government, especially in its handling of the 1992
Bombay stock market scandal and of a sugar shortage earlier this year.
The turmoil was compounded by arguments over the resignation on Wednesday
night of Mr A K Antony, the civil supplies minister, who quit unexpectedly
after he was named in a government note on the sugar affair presented to
parliament earlier in the day.
The note, deliberately written in a low-key way to avoid giving offence,
levelled vague criticisms at several officials and ministers. Mr Antony, who
is known for his honesty, reacted strongly at being tarred with the same
brush as others he believes guilty of incompetence in the affair.
While his resignation is unconnected with yesterday's offers, it increases
the pressure on ministers tainted by corruption allegations.
These include Mr Romeshwar Thakur, the minister of state for finance, and Mr
B Shankaranand, the health minister, who were both named in a parliamentary
inquiry into the Rs40bn (Pounds 820m) securities scandal, in which money was
illegally siphoned out of banks. Mr Thakur was accused in the report of
delaying an official probe into the affair.
Mr Shankaranand was accused of having authorised illegal money transfers
when oil minister and head of the state-owned Oil Industry Development
Board. Separately, Mr Kalpnath Rai, the food minister, has been criticised
in parliament for allegedly mismanaging emergency imports of sugar.
Mr Narasimha Rao has become concerned about allegations of incompetence and
corruption because these issues figured prominently in the recent state
elections in which Congress was defeated. Although voters were more
concerned with their local state administrations than the government in
Delhi, Mr Narasimha Rao seems to believe that the party needs to project a
cleaner image nationally.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Spain to revive Gibraltar leaseback idea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Spain is planning to resurrect suggestions for a leaseback of Gibraltar, or
a sharing of sovereignty, that were raised 10 years ago at the first annual
bilateral meeting to discuss the future of the British colony.
Mr Javier Solana, the Spanish foreign minister, will tell British
negotiators on Tuesday in London 'imaginative steps' are needed to end a
diplomatic deadlock and avert a 'mafia-type' takeover of the colony.
One Spanish proposal is that Gibraltar should be leased to Britain for an
unspecified number of years. Another is that London and Madrid would, for a
period, share sovereignty. Under either formula, territorial sovereignty
over Gibraltar would eventually be restored to Spain, though its
institutions and identity would be safeguarded by self-rule powers
negotiated between London and Madrid.
The UK has difficulties with the leaseback suggestion because the British
government is committed to Gibraltar's 1969 constitution. This guarantees
that the UK will not cede the colony to Spain against the wishes of the
majority of its population.
Spain is concerned that Gibraltar's economy, which was once dependent on the
UK's Ministry of Defence, relies increasingly on money laundering and
cigarette and drug smuggling.
Mr Solana will seek firm assurances from Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign
secretary, that illicit activities on the Rock will cease.
Spanish diplomatic protests about Gibraltar's alleged illegal economic
activity have increased in recent months, and Madrid has stepped up border
controls between Spain and the colony.
Madrid officials say the border controls are helping them build up a data
base on money laundering and smuggling.
Spanish police patrols on beaches close to Gibraltar seized three hauls of
hashish weighing a total of 350 kilos last week.

President Leonid Kuchma yesterday abandoned Ukraine's Dollars 10bn (Pounds
6bn) bond issue. The scheme, launched this spring by former President Leonid
Kravchuk, had been criticised over the legality of selling bonds backed by
Ukraine's industrial and natural resources. One MP also alleged the bonds
were sold in the UK and Switzerland, with the revenue diverted to secret
bank accounts. Mr Kuchma's decree dissolves the Ukrainian Credit Fund, which
oversaw the sale of 400 bonds worth Dollars 25m each, and orders prosecutors
to look into the corruption allegations. He also promised that 'all
obligations' to holders would be met. The episode casts yet another shadow
over Mr Kravchuk's last year in office. His prime minister during the last
nine months, Mr Yefim Zvyahilsky, was indicted in November on embezzlement
charges.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union farm ministers agreed yesterday to abolish the 'switchover'
mechanism, which has cushioned farm prices over the past decade at a cost of
Ecu6bn (Pounds 4.7bn). The switchover is part of the EU's system for
converting farm payments into national currencies. It operated to boost
agricultural prices by 21 per cent over the last 10 years as it revalues
farm payments to follow the upward movements of the strongest EU currency,
which was usually the D-Mark.
The German government, which was in favour of retaining the switchover,
managed to pass a compromise package which offers some compensation to
farmers for currency movements. The new rules compensate farmers if real
exchange rates move three percentage points below or five percentage points
above the green currency rate which is used for converting farm prices. The
compromise was passed against the view of the Commission and the UK
government, which, with Denmark, voted against the package.

Mr Vassilis Sevdalis, the head of Greece's privatisation agency, has been
suspended following allegations of a conflict of interest in the sale of
Piraiki-Patraiki, once Greece's biggest textile company, to a group of Greek
and Saudi investors. A judicial inquiry into the disposal is under way. Mr
Sevdalis, chairman of the Organisation for Industrial Reconstruction (OAE),
an umbrella organisation for disposing of debt-burdened state enterprises,
denied any wrongdoing. But according to industry ministry officials he
admitted being a shareholder in a computer company controlled by the
Vernikos group, one of the investors in Piraiki-Patraiki.
OAE agreed last month to sell the textile concern to Evritania, a company
backed by Vernikos, Olayan of Saudi Arabia and the Katsambas-Stratos group,
its former owner. Evritania agreed to pay Dr6.8bn (Pounds 17.9m) over six
years and re-hire 1,200 workers to start up the company's biggest plant, at
Patras in western Greece. Piraiki-Patraiki shut down three years ago, with
debt totalling almost Dr70bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French Defence Ministry yesterday awarded Matra a FFr2bn (Pounds 230m)
contract to develop a long-range cruise missile, eventually giving France
the equivalent of the Tomahawk, which the US used against Baghdad in the
1991 Gulf war. Matra Defense-Espace, part of the Lagardere group, plans to
develop the subsonic 'stealth' cruise missile, with a range of 400-600km,
using some of the technology from its shorter-range Apache missile already
being producing with Deutsche Aerospace of Germany.
Matra, which is negotiating to merge its missile business with that of
British Aerospace, also hopes to interest the UK Ministry of Defence in a
derivative of the cruise missile. The UK has invited offers for its
programme for the Conventional Armament Stand Off Missile, an air-to-surface
missile with a range of nearly 400km, and Mr Noel Forgeard, head of Matra
Defense, said yesterday that his company would propose a scaled-down version
of the French cruise missile to the UK. The French cruise missile, which
could cost a total of FFr5bn-FFr10bn, was the only big new programme written
into the 1995-2000 military spending framework programme approved earlier
this year.
Matra beat Aerospatiale for the development, but the latter company will be
a subcontractor on the cruise missile's development and was yesterday
awarded another FFr2bn contract to develop a supersonic anti-ship missile.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Dispute over UK colony as hard as the Rock: Spain and
Britain seem unable to control developments in Gibraltar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British officials have long compared annual meetings with their Spanish
counterparts to discuss Spain's claims to the UK colony of Gibraltar to
'visits to the dentist'.
Stepped-up border controls by Spain, which claims that the Rock has become a
drug smuggling and money laundering centre, are likely to make the next
round of talks between British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd and his
Spanish counterpart Javier Solana, scheduled for next Tuesday in London,
more painful than ever.
The 2 1/4 -sq mile Crown colony that nestles under a towering limestone rock
near the southern tip of Spain remains an intractable problem on the
diplomatic agenda of both the British and Spanish governments. The
increasing assertiveness of Mr Joe Bossano, Gibraltar's chief minister since
1988, has served to drive the bilateral talks even further down a dead-end.
The embarrassing truth about the talks is that neither side has anything of
substance to say to the other for both appear impotent to control
developments on the Rock.
In fact, each of the parties involved with Gibraltar has a separate agenda:
Spain wants territorial sovereignty over the Rock which the Gibraltarians
refuse to accept; the UK is committed to respecting the wishes of the
Gibraltarians but it wants to monitor closely what goes on in its colony;
and Gibraltar wants freedom from Spanish claims and from British
interference.
What makes it all the more difficult is that the border controls, ostensibly
to build up a data base on the Rock's drugs business, often result in
six-hour queues stretching deep into the colony's overcrowded urban centre.
Gibraltarians resent it as much as they did the blockade imposed by General
Franco in 1969 and lifted only after 16 years.
Accusations of bad faith, real or imagined whispering campaigns and sheer
ill-temper fostered by past fears and present frustrations have replaced the
optimism that marked the re-opening of Gibraltar's land frontier with Spain
in 1985 and the start of the so-called Brussels negotiations process between
London and Madrid to discuss 'all aspects' of the future of the colony.
Meanwhile Gibraltar, described by Spain's prime minister Mr Felipe Gonzalez
as a 'stone in the shoe' of Madrid's relations with London, has been pushed,
and has pushed itself, into an isolation that is wholly at odds with an open
European economy.
Effective lobbying in Brussels by the Spanish, who claim sovereignty over
Gibraltar, has, among other things, prevented the airstrip, which divides
the Rock from mainland Spain, from gaining the benefits of air traffic
deregulation within the EU.
But the tough tactics employed by Spain as it pursues its 281-year old claim
over Gibraltar are increasingly overshadowed by Britain's efforts to reclaim
a measure of control over a colony that it fears may have cut loose from
Whitehall's moorings.
Mr Bossano believes a return to a virtual frontier blockade is bad enough.
But worse is the squeeze he suspects is being engineered by London to
undermine the colony's attempt to make itself economically self-sufficient
as a step towards self-determination.
The view from London is that Mr Bossano has overstepped his brief by
seeking, though without much success, to set up Gibraltar as an off-shore
financial centre selling banking services to the European Union as a de
facto member but with looser regulations than in the UK. Britain is
responsible for the Rock's external affairs under the terms of the colony's
1969 constitution and Whitehall is firm about its supervisory powers, in
particular those covered by EU directives concerning the financial sector.
The festering relationship between Whitehall and the colony's local
government came into the open this summer when Gibraltar's London-appointed
attorney general, Mr John Blackburn Gittings, resigned nearly a year before
his three-year posting ended.
He had concluded that conflicts of interest in an increasingly politically
charged environment had left him with no option but to stand down. As
attorney-general, Mr Blackburn Gittings had to pursue the dual role of legal
adviser to the Gibraltarian government and legal representative of the
British government at a time of growing tension between Mr Bossano and
London.
At the centre of that tension is Mr Bossano's accusation that Whitehall's
regulatory supervision prevents Gibraltar from developing tax-efficient
financial services similar to those in Luxembourg. 'I think (the UK) is
hampering us,' he says. 'It could be a long-term strategy to make Gibraltar
look to Spain for its future.'
Mr Bossano says the EU allows discretion in the implementation of its
directives and that Whitehall should allow more leeway over those that
directly affect Gibraltar's interests. This makes Whitehall nervous.
'We are making absolutely sure that we have control over financial
regulations in Gibraltar,' says a senior UK Treasury official. 'In the past
the Gibraltarian government has had a very large say and this is no longer
the case.'
Seen from Madrid, the core of the Gibraltar problem is that London has been
too lenient with Mr Bossano. 'We are coming round to thinking that London
cannot deliver anything on Gibraltar,' says a Spanish diplomat who will be
attending the London talks.
At the same time, as the recent border controls demonstrate, Spain is making
no attempt to 'win the hearts and minds of the Gibraltarians', say British
officials. They point out that the Spanish government was angered when Mr
Bossano attended the IMF-World Bank meeting in Madrid in October as part of
the UK delegation and it ignored the chief minister when he said he was
prepared to negotiate directly with Spain.
Madrid was not in the mood for such peace overtures after a 'Gibraltar
national day' that had been held on the Rock the previous month. Mr Bossano
had invited Basque and Catalan separatists to celebrate the colony's
self-determination ambitions.
Then there is the growing evidence that Gibraltar's economy, as it fails to
make headway in its off-shore banking ambitions, is becoming increasingly
dependent not just on cigarette smuggling into Spain, a traditional
money-maker on the Rock, but also on narcotics.
Madrid claims that in the first 10 months of this year 42 tons of hashish
have been seized by its police, as well as 2.3m cartons of cigarettes.
Hashish seized from Gibraltar-based boats last year totalled 38 tons, up
from 10 tons in 1992.
Spanish officials say the Rock is coming close to a Mafia-type takeover:
'Gibraltar's narcotics business is industrially organised,' says one
official.
There are few satisfactory explanations for the presence of 200-odd fast
launches - painted black to help avoid detection at night - moored in
Gibraltar's marina.
The stock response on the Rock is that the launches leave the marina empty
of goods and return empty; whatever might occur in the 9-mile wide Straits
of Gibraltar that separate Morocco from Spain is not the concern of the
colony's government. Spanish police say drugs are loaded in the straits and
off-loaded on Spanish beaches.
Smuggling has increased in importance as Mr Bossano's financial centre
ambitions have foundered - partly because of Spanish opposition and partly
because of timing, given the recent global recession. The financial services
industry's prestige headquarters was to have been a multi-million
development called Europort, work on which began in 1989 on land reclaimed
from Gibraltar's harbour by Baltica group of Denmark. The office towers are
completed but virtually empty.
After dragging Baltica Finans, the Danish group's investment unit, to the
brink of bankruptcy, Europort has continued to haunt Mr Bossano's government
because of a row over fraud and corruption.
British police have been asked by Gibraltar's governor to co-operate with
Danish police following up allegations of fraud linked to the development.
Unofficially, they are looking into whether there is evidence of corruption
by members of Mr Bossano's government.
A former Baltica employee has testified at a Danish court hearing into
Baltica's near collapse that a payment of Pounds 250,000 was made to a
Gibraltar minister in connection with Europort.
Mr Bossano denies any impropriety by members of his government. 'There are
allegations of fraud by Danes against Danes involving Danish money. There is
no Gibraltarian money involved,' he says.
The UK and Spain, as allies in the EU and Nato, cannot allow the Gibraltar
problem to degenerate further. North Africa, clearly visible from the Rock,
is enough of a security flashpoint for Europe as it is.
In the circumstances, the best outcome for the talks next week would be a
realisation by both sides that the Brussels negotiating process has run its
course and that a radically different approach is required.
One way forward, favoured by some Spanish foreign ministry officials, could
be for Madrid to take up Mr Bossano's olive branch and begin discreet
contacts with the chief minister to find out what is on his 'shopping list'.
Should Madrid take such a plunge it might well find to its surprise that Mr
Bossano, who is a tough bargainer but is ultimately a realist, will be
willing to settle for some form of dual sovereignty or leaseback arrangement
that will respect the Rock's identity and institutions. This was suggested
by Spain ten years ago, and Madrid says London has never properly responded.
Mr Bossano needs a deal because he cannot afford to have Europort, the
duty-free shops on Main Street and the hotels losing increasing amounts of
money (the Holiday Inn hotel, the second-biggest, has applied for
receivership). And certainly he cannot afford to have the blackened hulls of
the stripped-down speedboats in the marina as virtually the only sign of
financial success.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden and Finland yesterday announced a slight fall in inflation in
November only days after the central banks of both countries raised interest
rates because of fears of an upward swing in inflation next year. The
consumer price index in Sweden rose 2.4 per cent in the year to November,
compared with 2.5 per cent in the year to October. However, the Riksbank
believes tax rises and capacity shortages will lead to a breach of its
target of 3 per cent inflation in 1995. Also yesterday new orders to
industries rose 1.0 per cent in October from September and jumped 17 per
cent compared with October 1993. In Finland, year-on-year core inflation
stood at just 1.1 per cent in November, compared with 1.3 per cent the month
before. This was well within the central bank's target of 2 per cent in
1995.
A 0.2 per cent rise in prices during November kept Spain's year-on-year
headline inflation unchanged at 4.4 per cent. The failure to reduce price
increases will now make it difficult for the government to achieve its
revised year-end headline inflation target of 4.1 per cent.
Registered unemployment in the Netherlands rose to 490,000 in the three
months ended November 30, from 448,000 in the similar period a year earlier.

FT  16 DEC 94 / France and US raise the stakes in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France and the US, the leading western players in the Bosnian poker game,
have both raised the stakes by promising to get more deeply involved, at
least in the short term.
That was the conclusion to emerge yesterday from a two-day meeting of Nato
defence ministers where ambitious plans for new multinational operations in
Bosnia topped the agenda.
Paris and Washington have both made it plain that deeper involvement for a
short time could be a prelude to abandoning the scene in Bosnia - something
neither wants to do, although it could become inevitable. And, according to
diplomats at Nato headquarters, each country has a hidden as well as an
overt agenda.
France is promoting a plan to regroup and reinforce the UN mission in
Bosnia, which would have the happy side-effect of making it much easier to
withdraw if that becomes unavoidable.
The US has thrown its weight behind the idea of a massive Nato operation to
provide 'cover' for an eventual UN pull-out from Bosnia. If it ever goes
ahead, this operation would also have a side-effect: it would satisfy the
long-standing US demand for effective intervention against the Serbs.
The French plan for upgrading the UN operation in Bosnia will be discussed
next week in The Hague at a meeting of military chiefs from the 11 Nato
countries which are directly or indirectly involved in Bosnia.
Britain, second biggest troop contributor after France, has serious
reservations about the French plans. One reason, say diplomats, is that
London fears a watering down of the authority of General Sir Michael Rose,
the British officer who is UN commander in Bosnia.
The French ideas include the securing of Sarajevo airport; the creation of a
safe corridor between Sarajevo and Split; and the regrouping of UN forces
near the corridor. Whatever their other merits, all these ideas would make
for an easier withdrawal.
As for the US-sponsored plan for a massive withdrawal operation, one effect
would be a transfer of operational control from the UN - whose caution in
Bosnia has infuriated Washington - to the Atlantic alliance. That could mean
that even as they withdrew, western forces in Bosnia would finally take the
action against the Serbs which US politicians have long been advocating.
The scale of the proposed operation, which would be by far the biggest
mission Nato has ever sent into a war zone, seems to grow with every news
report. Under one scenario circulating among Nato diplomats, the exercise
would require 29,600 ground troops and 4,000 airmen for combat roles alone,
plus many thousands more in communications and logistics roles.
Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, disclosed yesterday that the Nato
operation would also envisage removing or destroying the Serbs'
anti-aircraft batteries,something the US is already impatient to do.
However, the Nato withdrawal plan would present all countries with some hard
financial choices. On one hand, it has been estimated that getting the
necessary equipment into position would cost about Dollars 800m - roughly
the equivalent of Nato's entire military budget for the year - while every
month the operation lasted would cost about Dollars 270m.
These are big sums, and, spending them could leave Nato without funds to
finance military co-operation with countries in central Europe. On the other
hand, Canada and Nordic states deployed the best of their armour and
communications equipment in Bosnia, and the thought of abandoning or
destroying them in an over-hasty or poorly supported withdrawal would be
nightmarish.
The six-point ceasefire plan advanced by Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb
leader, has clouded the outlook for any of the plans discussed in Brussels
ever coming to fruition. As one Nato diplomat saw it, Mr Karadzic is clearly
hoping that his new show of reasonableness will divide the international
community by satisfying some countries while leaving others sceptical.
Mr Perry, and Mr Willy Claes, Nato secretary-general, both stressed
yesterday the ceasefire proposals were no substitute for a full-blown peace
plan. Mr Claes expressed doubt as to whether it was necessary for
ex-president Jimmy Carter, or any other high-level intermediary, to talk
ceasefire terms with Mr Karadzic. But Mr Perry was slightly more positive,
saying the Bosnian Serb initiative could help the humanitarian situation.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Prospect of new talks over Chechnya
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GROZNY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A full-scale war in the rebel Russian republic of Chechnya remained in
abeyance last night as the possibility emerged of a new round of
negotiations and rumours spread of the unwillingness of Russian troops to
encircle the capital, Grozny.
General Dzhokar Dudayev, the Chechen president, said he was willing for
negotiations, broken off on Wednesday, to restart - 'at the highest
political level'.
He was speaking after a cabinet meeting at which Mr Paimaz Abubakarov, the
finance minister and head of the Chechen negotiating team, presented a new
position for discussion with the Russians.
Earlier, Mr Abubakarov had told the Financial Times that the new position
depended on the Russians halting hostilities, on the agenda being broadened
and on the level of the negotiating team being raised.
'I believe that to continue to negotiate is the only way to stop massive
bloodshed', he said, a line evidently supported by Gen Dudayev and the
cabinet.
The situation around Grozny remained very tense last night as the first
shell fell within the city itself - on its northern suburbs - and as the
northern division of the Russian forces moved to within 7km of the city's
edge. At intervals, the Russians bombarded Chechen positions on the
perimeter of Grozny, although the firing was lighter than in the past two
days.
In Moscow, President Boris Yeltzin appeared to support the more conciliatory
line emerging from the Chechen leadership. He reportedly extended the
deadline for surrendering weapons for a further 48 hours and agreed to talk
at a higher level.
There are signs that disagreements about the war within the Russian
leadership have afflicted the troops in the field.
The column coming in from the west, commanded by General Ivan Babichev has
been halted for two days at the village of Davidenko, where the road to
Grozny is blocked by women dancing and praying.
Within the capital, the population continues to prepare for war. On its
northern side, emplacements are being thrown up, trenches dug and elite
volunteer regiments, some of them claiming to be ready to fight to the
death, are taking positions in front of the Russian tank column.
The stakes were raised by a Chechen claim that they had nuclear artillery
shells - and the cannon to fire them - but that they would not use them.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Stern warning for Balladur on public deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of France yesterday warned the Balladur government that it must
stop slipping behind its plan to reduce the public deficit, even if it means
raising taxes, to meet the Maastricht criteria for monetary union by 1996.
This sharp warning came as the newly independent French central bank set
monetary goals for 1995. It renewed its pledge to keep annual inflation
below 2 per cent and the franc stable, and to allow M3 - the broad measure
of money - to grow by 5 per cent a year over the medium term, permitting
non-inflationary growth of 2.5-3 per cent in the economy.
Reacting to the slight weakening of the franc in recent days, Mr Jean-Claude
Trichet, the Bank of France governor, said 'speculators (against the franc)
will lose, as before'. He claimed 'in my eyes there is the potential of the
franc appreciating, rather than depreciating'.
France's inflation rate, now running at an annual 1.6 per cent, had been
better than that of Germany and the Netherlands for the past three and a
half years, and, with the exception of one half year, better than that of
the US since 1987.
Exploiting his central bank's one-year-old statutory independence, Mr
Trichet urged the government of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and its
successor after next May's presidential election to 'undertake a decisive
reduction of public deficits'.
In November 1993, France joined Germany in announcing a joint convergence
programme which, in the case of France, was supposed to bring down total
public deficits to 5.1 per cent of gross domestic product this year and 4.2
per cent next year to meet the Maastricht guideline of 3 per cent in 1996.
The outturn of this year's public deficits is 5.3 per cent, and the
government's prediction for 1995 is deficit spending equivalent to 4.6 per
cent of GDP.
Mr Trichet, who negotiated Maastricht for France when he headed the
Treasury, said 'the target of 3 per cent in 1996 will have to be met'.
'It would be unimaginable for France, representing what it does in Europe,
not be within the Maastricht criteria in 1996,' he said. Monetary union in
1997, while difficult, was possible through 'will and continued effort'.
He urged that extra tax revenue from economic growth - which Insee, the
statistics agency, yesterday predicted would be at an annual pace of more
than 3 per cent in the first half of 1995 - 'be devoted to cutting the
deficit'. Non-productive public spending had to be squeezed further, too.
If these two measures were not enough, 'then extra revenues will have to be
raised', though privately the central bank acknowledges that is only likely
after a new president has installed a new government in May.
While vaunting its success in reducing the central government deficit, the
Balladur government has used recent windfall gains in tax receipts to meet
new spending commitments. Under Maastricht accounting rules, the government
cannot use privatisation receipts to plug the deficit gap because the sales
of public companies are subtracted from the state's assets.
Mr Trichet also warned unions to keep their wage demands low and urged
companies to invest and to build new industrial capacity so that, allowing
for a catch-up from the 1993 recession, the economy could grow by 3 per cent
or more without inflation increasing at the same time.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Berlusconi prepares showdown with Bossi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the embattled Italian prime minister, was yesterday
preparing for a showdown early next week in parliament with his troublesome
ally, Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League.
Mr Berlusconi indicated he would be the one to impose a vote of confidence,
rather than leave the initiative to the opposition. His aim is to force Mr
Bossi and his 105 deputies to decide finally whether they back the
eight-month-old, right-wing coalition.
The issue was raised at a meeting yesterday between President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro and Mr Berlusconi. The debate could be staged on Tuesday or
Wednesday, depending on when the 1995 budget clears its last parliamentary
hurdles.
The president has indicated he has few illusions about the durability of the
government. Last month he voiced open disagreement with Mr Berlusconi over
the advisability of calling early elections. However, Mr Berlusconi regards
the threat one of his main cards, believing Mr Bossi risks being one of the
main casualties.
Mr Bossi, for his part, declined to say if he was willing to formalise a new
alliance with the centre-left that would place the League with the former
communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) and the Popular party (PPI) of
Mr Rocco Buttiglione.
Suggestions that almost half the League's 105 deputies were not willing to
follow Mr Bossi in a break with the government were denied yesterday.
Italian ministers should decide today whether to relax the terms of Telecom
Italia's monopoly over certain telephone services, in order to offset the
impact of increased competition in the lucrative mobile telephone sector,
Andrew Hill writes from Milan.
In an indication that a compromise may be found to satisfy the
state-controlled company, the Telecoms Ministry said yesterday that, after
the ministerial discussion, Telecom Italia was likely to sign the joint
convention governing digital mobile phone services.
Telecom Italia has withheld its signature pending a satisfactory reply to
its demands for full liberalisation of mobile phone tariffs and a cut in the
fee it pays the government for its monopoly over other services.
The final ministerial decision could be complicated by the obvious
ill-feeling stirred up this week between Mr Berlusconi and his old business
rival, Mr Carlo De Benedetti.
Olivetti, the computer group chaired by Mr De Benedetti, is one of the
leading partners in the consortium which will operate Italy's new digital
mobile phone network.
The consortium, Omnitel-Pronto Italia, won the licence in competition with
a consortium including Fiat, the automotive and industrial group, and
Fininvest, Mr Berlusconi's media group.
Mr De Benedetti angered Mr Berlusconi by indicating in an interview that his
administration should be replaced by an institutional government.
On Tuesday, Mr Cesare Previti, defence minister and former Fininvest lawyer,
said that the licence had been granted 'unjustly' to Omnitel-Pronto Italia.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Bulgaria backs ex-communists and king: The political revival
of two rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By THEODOR TROEV and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SOFIA, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bulgarian Socialist party (BSP), successor to what was once the eastern
European communist party most loyal to Moscow, is expected to return to
power after general elections this weekend. If so, it will join similar
parties in Lithuania, Poland and Hungary which revived like Lazarus from
what was widely assumed to be death after the collapse of the Berlin Wall.
But an equally miraculous revival has been taking place at the opposite end
of the political spectrum - a surge in popular enthusiasm for the idea of
monarchy in general and for the exiled monarch, ex-King Simeon the Second,
in particular.
The popularity of the king has been rising since the downfall of Todor
Zhivkov, the old communist dictator, in 1989. Even President Zhelyu Zhelev,
a former dissident, who used to be the most popular politician in Bulgaria,
recently came behind King Simeon in public opinion polls.
The 57-year-old king, who lives in Madrid, is widely considered to be closer
to restoration as a modern constitutional monarch than any other exiled
royal claimant in the former communist world. Many of the 49 political
organisations contesting the election have sought to capitalise on the
popular longing for 'a good and just king'.
The socialists have not been able to ride the monarchist chariot for
ideological reasons. But political rivals claim the BSP has secretly
inspired monarchist organisations to register for the election to prevent
them joining the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), the main anti-communist
coalition. Every vote diverted from the UDF serves the BSP cause.
In 1991, most royalists voted for the UDF after King Simeon appealed to
Bulgarians to vote for the 'democratic forces'. This was interpreted as
support for the UDF, although the king refused to urge anyone to vote for a
particular party. Dispersion of pro-monarchist votes, meanwhile, meant that
none of the divided monarchist groups managed to clear the 4 per cent hurdle
needed to enter parliament.
This weekend's early elections result from the refusal of both the BSP and
the UDF to replace the outgoing non-party government of technocrats. This
was led by an academic, Mr Lyuben Berov, but supported by the BSP. It
resigned last September after successfully renegotiating Bulgaria's Dollars
9.3bn (Pounds 5.7bn) foreign debt.
This time around the UDF has failed to attract more than a few of the
smaller pro-monarchist clubs to join its election campaign and has found it
hard to attract pro-monarchist and pro-republican voters. The UDF has
pledged to contest the 1946 referendum which abolished the monarchy, but has
not come out in favour of a restoration.
King Simeon has urged the monarchist groups to unite. But political
infighting and personal power struggles have left voters to decide between
seven big monarchist groups and many smaller monarchist clubs.
All that unites the groups is a desire for restoration of the old Turnovo
constitution. The king's supporters say he is still the monarch as there was
no formal abdication. The royal family was forced to leave Bulgaria when
Simeon was just nine years old after a rigged plebiscite under the new
communist rulers.
This abolished the monarchy in 1946, although the Turnovo constitution, with
the monarchy as head of state, was not changed at the time. On reaching his
18th birthday, Simeon of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha was proclaimed King of the
Bulgarians under the Turnovo constitution.
Opinion polls suggest that more and more Bulgarians see restoration of the
monarchy as a guarantee of stability. Royalists also argue that monarchy
could help build a barrier against further ethnic tensions in the Balkans.
Politicians, eager to seize more power in elections, are more prone to
manipulating ethnic minorities than a monarch capable of rising above such
calculations, they say.
In an interview, King Simeon said that he could provide the country with
'unity, national reconciliation and a sense of recovered dignity'.
The ex-king does not rule out the possibility of co-existence of
constitutional monarchy with a socialist government. But analysts in Sofia
doubt that the monarch could be brought closer to the throne if the polls
are accurate and the politically disciplined BSP defeats the divided
monarchist and anti-communist forces.
The latter outnumber the socialists by a big majority, but have proved
unable as yet to forge the alliances needed to keep the socialists out of
power or put the king back on his throne.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Calm hand at helm of uneasy coalition: The challenges facing
John Bruton as Ireland's new premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   by JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Bruton was once described as 'John Unionist' by Mr Albert Reynolds,
the man he succeeded yesterday as Ireland's new prime minister.
It was an unfortunate slip of the tongue. Nonetheless, the inadvertent
allusion to Mr Bruton's views on Northern Ireland highlights one of the key
differences in government policy likely to emerge with his accession
yesterday as head of a three-party coalition between his Fine Gael party,
Labour and the small Democratic Left.
The feeling in Dublin last night was one of relief after a month of
deliberations and allegations, which had left Ireland in the hands of a
caretaker administration since the collapse of the Fianna Fail-Labour
coalition after a judicial appointment row.
The delay had cast an ill-timed shadow over the Northern Ireland peace
process, straining relations between Dublin and Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing, and halting negotiations on the joint framework document
which Ireland and the UK hope will form the basis for all-party talks on
Ulster's constitutional future.
Ireland still faces a hectic diplomatic agenda, with Dublin due to host the
European Union's 1996 intergovernmental conference. Some analysts yesterday
predicted the coalition might not survive that long.
The potential for discord within such a wide-ranging coalition is clear.
Fianna Fail, licking its wounds on the opposition benches, is in no mood to
be forgiving.
Mr Bruton's Fine Gael is a rural-based conservative party with largely
middle class support which has lost votes to Mr Dick Spring's more urban
Labour party. Meanwhile, Mr Proinsias De Rossa's Democratic Left is an
old-fashioned socialist party and the successor of the Official IRA, when
the Provisional IRA broke away to pursue the armed struggle in 1970.
Even at the last minute yesterday, Democratic Left looked set to pull out of
negotiations once it became clear the party, which has just six seats in the
Dail, was being offered a single cabinet portfolio. Last night the single
overriding preoccupation of all the parties seemed to be a determination to
see Fianna Fail consigned to the opposition.
In Mr Bruton, the government will have calm if uncharismatic leadership. A
former finance minister, he is a plain speaking barrister with 20 years in
the Dail and a wealth of ministerial experience. Politically he is said to
be close to the rural wing of the party, identified with Mr Liam Cosgrave, a
former prime minister.
In February Mr Bruton rode out a leadership challenge, and still could be
vulnerable to attack from the liberal wing of the party associated with
another former premier, Dr Garret Fitzgerald.
Mr Bruton likes to dub Fine Gael as 'part of the great European Christian
Democrat movement'. He campaigned in favour of divorce reform, where there
will be a meeting of minds with Labour and Democratic Left.
On the North, the strains may be difficult to hide. Fine Gael is
historically identified as the party which voted for the Anglo-Irish Treaty
of 1921, which created partition. As a believer in a more accommodating
stance towards the Unionists, Mr Bruton is likely to push for reform of
Articles 2 and 3 of the constitution, which enshrine Ireland's territorial
claim to Northern Ireland.
London in particular is keen to see that Fianna Fail, which has played a key
role in the peace process so far, should not now be isolated. The party, as
the voice of constitutional republicanism (Fianna Fail voted against the
Treaty) enjoys better relations with Sinn Fein than the other parties.
As a result, Fianna Fail's support could be critical if the coalition is to
steer through constitutional reform, which would have to be put to a
referendum.
On the economy, the coalition's problems are perhaps more acute. Mr Bruton
is sometimes described as Thatcherite on economic policy and he certainly
won a reputation for tight spending policies when in charge of finance in
1982 after the profligate years of Mr Charles Haughey's Fianna Fail
government.
Any attempt by Fine Gael to cut taxes and reduce public spending is likely
to be resisted by Labour and Democratic Left.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Carter awaits evidence of ceasefire to take up Bosnian Serb
invitation to mediate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Former US president Jimmy Carter was yesterday waiting for evidence of a
cessation of hostilities in Sarajevo before deciding whether to leave on a
private mediation mission at the invitation of the Bosnian Serbs, writes Our
Foreign Staff.
A White House spokesman said Mr Carter could be 'on his way in 24 hours' if
the lull continued. In an interview with Cable News Network television on
Wednesday night, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic asked Mr Carter to
mediate and proposed a six-point plan to give up some territory, agree an
immediate ceasefire around Sarajevo and the re-opening of the city airport,
release detained UN officers and Moslem prisoners of war younger than 19
years old, and allow free passage of relief convoys.
There was general US scepticism, voiced strongly in Brussels by Mr William
Perry, US defence secretary, and by others, that Mr Karadzic was engaged in
more than a public relations ploy designed to secure some form of
recognition for his regime.
Mr Perry said Mr Carter had promised not to deviate from the existing
international peace plan as the basis for a long-term settlement.
In London, senior government officials said they welcomed any attempt by Mr
Carter to broker peace in the region but admitted they were 'sceptical
rather than cynical' about what such an intervention could achieve.

The final ministerial decision could be complicated by the obvious
ill-feeling stirred up this week between Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime

Olivetti, the computer group chaired by Mr De Benedetti, is one of the
leading partners in the consortium which will operate Italy's new digital
mobile phone network.
The consortium, Omnitel-Pronto Italia, won the licence to compete with
Telecom Italia on the eve of the March general election which brought Mr
Berlusconi to power.
The defeated consortium included Fiat, the automotive and industrial group,
and Fininvest, Mr Berlusconi's media group.
Mr De Benedetti angered Mr Berlusconi by indicating, in an interview
published last weekend, that his administration should be replaced by an
institutional government.
On Tuesday, Mr Cesare Previti, defence minister and former Fininvest lawyer,
told another newspaper that the mobile phone contract had been granted
'unjustly' to the Omnitel-Pronto Italia consortium. Mr Previti said he would
go into more detail 'when the moment comes to explain this abomination'.
Mr Berlusconi himself also launched a thinly veiled attack on Olivetti and
Mr De Benedetti in a letter to Il Sole 24 Ore, Italy's business newspaper,
published ahead of his questioning by Milan anti-corruption magistrates on
Tuesday.
Telecom Italia has demanded the right to set its own prices for mobile
telephone services on the existing analogue network.
The company has built a digital network, with which Omnitel-Pronto Italia
will compete. But the state company argues that if the price of its analogue
services continue to be regulated it will lose subscribers to the new
consortium.
Omnitel-Pronto Italia - which includes US, German and Scandinavian partners
 -claims any concession to Telecom Italia would put it at a further
disadvantage as the new entrant in the market.
Analogue customers can use their phones only in Italy, whereas the digital
subscribers can make calls from other European countries which have adopted
the common 'GSM' standard.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Grozny defiant under Russian shells
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GROZNY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The first Russian shells fell yesterday on Grozny, the capital of the
separatist region of Chechnya, and local defenders began erecting earthworks
to try to sustain an expected full-scale assault. The shells fell on a block
of flats, as a Russian assault meant to crush the defiant Chechen leadership
neared the northern edge of Grozny. The concussion shattered all the windows
on the side of one building.
There was only sporadic bombardment of Chechnya yesterday, but the shelling
of Grozny is the latest in a series of tough Russian manoeuvres, despite
reports that Moscow extended its deadline for the surrender of Chechen
forces from yesterday by 48 hours, that appear to have alienated much of the
population.
The Chechens are too lightly armed to block a Russian assault effectively,
but their defence preparations made it appear that fighting would be bloody
on both sides.
Large numbers of Chechen defenders in crisp battle fatigues patrolled the
road equipped with Kalashnikov automatic rifles, armour-piercing grenade
launchers and shoulder-fired rockets. 'A tank is a rolling coffin,' declared
Mr Ruslan Gulaev, the commander of several dozen Chechens guarding the
highway.
Mixed in with the men were a group of commandos calling themselves the
Ghazivat, fighters who have sworn on the Koran to fight to the death. These
units are identifiable by their green headbands, and call President Dzhokar
Dudayev Imam of the Caucasus. 'When Russia started its aggression, we
regarded it as holy war,' said one. 'Our Imam appealed to the people to
defend their land and their faith. If we win, we become wealthy in the
future. If we die, we'll join Allah and be happy.'
Meanwhile, a brisk trade was going on at Grozny's weapons bazaar. One man
wanted to trade a radio for a box of grenades. Another picked up five
weapons jackets for his fighters. A third wanted to trade his Makharov
pistol for a Kalashnikov. 'I want to kill more Ivans,' he said.
At Pervomayskoi, a village just north of Grozny that has sustained the worst
of the Russian bombardment, many residents have taken to living underground.
There was no talk of surrendering arms, which Moscow has demanded. Instead,
the assault seems to have hardened the resolve to fight. 'If we surrender,
they'll start searching our houses and arresting our young people,' said one
housewife. 'They should have given us a chance to make it on our own.'

FT  16 DEC 94 / Labour inflicts crushing poll defeat on Tories: Heavy blow
to Major as Dudley voters deliver postwar record swing in by-election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party crashed to a record-breaking defeat against Labour in
the Dudley West by-election in the early hours of this morning.
In a disastrous blow for Mr John Major's government, Labour won the West
Midlands constituency with a 29.12 per cent swing - the largest from the
Conservatives to Labour at a by-election since the second world war.
The surge of support which has given Labour an unprecedented lead in recent
opinion polls helped Mr Tony Blair's party to convert a Tory majority of
5,789 at the last election into victory by 20,694 votes.
The Tory vote plummeted from 34,729 in April 1992 to just 7,706.
The swing was the second largest from the Conservatives to Labour in a
by-election this century.
It broke through the 21 per cent swing from the Tories to Labour in the
Mid-Staffordshire by-election in March 1990, which took place at the height
of the poll tax rebellion.
If this morning's result were repeated across the country at a general
election, it would leave the Conservatives with almost no seats in the House
of Commons.
The victory of Mr Ian Pearson, the Labour candidate, was instantly hailed by
the party's senior figures as evidence that it can win a constituency with a
broadly middle-class electorate which has been staunchly Conservative for
more than 15 years.
Mr Blair said the voters of Dudley had 'shown that the Tory agenda of the
eighties has run its course. People are tired of second best for Britain and
are looking to Labour to get Britain going again,' he said. 'We must not let
them down.'
Mr John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, said: 'This is a remarkable
victory for us and a remarkable swing.'
The extent of the defeat stunned senior government figures. Mr Stephen
Dorrell, the heritage secretary, admitted the result was a very grim one for
the Conservatives. 'It's obviously a bad result for us,' he said, 'I don't
disguise that at all.'
The result is unlikely to put immediate pressure on Mr Major's position at
the head of the Conservative party because a leadership contest cannot take
place for another 12 months.
But it will compound the growing disarray among Tory backbenchers who are
already divided over the party's approach to Europe and tax cuts.
The defeat reduces the government's notional majority in the House of
Commons to 13, including the nine Tories who lost or resigned the whip after
a parliamentary rebellion on UK contributions to the European Union two
weeks ago.
However, the willingness of the rebels to continue to vote against the
government means that Mr Major now leads an administration with an effective
overall minority of five votes.
Government ministers found a few crumbs of comfort in the very low turnout
of around 47 per cent in the Dudley West poll. This was well below the 82.1
per cent turnout in the constituency at the last election, but broadly
similar to the figure for previous by-elections in December.
Senior Tory officials said the low turnout suggested that disillusioned
Conservatives had stayed at home rather than vote Labour.
They also pointed out that the total Labour vote had actually fallen from
the 28,940 polled at the 1992 election.
Labour's leaders argued that their campaign tactics, which stressed the
Tories' recent tax increases, had played an important part in the victory.
By contrast, the government's defeat in the Commons over the implementation
of VAT on fuel contributed to the problems faced by Mr Graham Postles, the
Tory candidate.
The swing to Labour yesterday was not as great as the 35 per cent switch
from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats at Christchurch last year.
But it was less than 1 percentage point below the largest swing this century
from the Conservatives to Labour, which took place at the Liverpool
Wavertree by-election in 1935.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Warburg merger negotiations called off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, RICHARD WATERS and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Stanley and SG Warburg yesterday called off talks aimed at creating a
dominant global investment bank because of resistance from Warburg's fund
management arm, Mercury Asset Management, to the merger proposals.
The merger talks broke down after the board of MAM, which is 75 per cent
owned by Warburg, demanded a premium offer for its minority shareholders, as
well as operational independence from Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley's executives indicated publicly for the first time that their
primary motive had been to gain control of MAM. 'MAM was the reason for us
to do this deal,' said Mr Stephen Waters, co-managing director of Morgan
Stanley Europe.
Although Warburg intends to resume its former strategy of building a global
business independently, the breakdown may increase the chance of a takeover
bid as well as merger offers by other investment banks.
It may also renew tensions between Warburg and MAM, which believes that its
institutional investor customers prefer it to be independent.
This year, MAM limited business it gave Warburg in protest at the handling
of a takeover bid.
MAM's board, advised independently by Lazard Brothers, the merchant bank, is
thought to have asked for a premium of up to 30 per cent for minority
shareholders, which would have meant offering them about Pounds 400m for
their equity.
Senior executives of Morgan Stanley said last night they would have been
prepared to pay some premium to the MAM shareholders. However, they were not
willing to accept the demands of MAM for continuing full independence.
Warburg's shares fell to close 99p down at 699p after the announcement,
while MAM's shares fell 67p to close at 678p. MAM shares rose after last
week's disclosure of merger talks on expectations of a premium offer.
In New York, Morgan Stanley's shares closed down  3/8 at Dollars 61.
MAM issued a statement saying its objective had been 'to maintain the
operating independence of its business for the benefit of its clients'. The
company has defended its independence from Warburg in the past.
Lord Cairns, Warburg's chief executive, said the merger had been 'a bold
initiative, but by no means essential for further progress'. He said Warburg
was 'as strongly placed as ever' to become a leading global investment bank.
Mr Richard Fisher, Morgan Stanley chairman, said Warburg would have been 'a
good fit' and the collapse was unfortunate.
Talks broke down yesterday after a meeting in London on Tuesday attended by
Mr Fisher and Mr John Mack, Morgan Stanley's president. The US firm
contacted Warburg to tell it that MAM's terms were unacceptable.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Saatchi executives press chairman to resign his post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Maurice Saatchi's tenure as chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the
advertising company he founded, looked increasingly uncertain last night
after the company's top executives said he should stand down.
Mr Saatchi's position was further undermined when the group's financial
advisers, SG Warburg and UBS, told the company they felt Mr Saatchi could
not survive a shareholders' vote.
However Mr Charles Scott, the group's chief executive, and Mr Jeremy
Sinclair, executive deputy chairman, said in a memo they would not support a
call for Mr Saatchi's resignation.
'If a resolution is put to the board demanding the chairman's dismissal we
could not in the best interests of the shareholders support it,' they said.
The memo, also signed by Mr Saatchi, was intended for the six non-executives
attending a board meeting today.
A friend of Mr Scott said last night that the chief executive had signed the
memo in the interests of maintaining peace in the boardroom, but it 'does
not mean he is standing shoulder to shoulder with Mr Saatchi'.
Commenting on the battle by a powerful group of shareholders to unseat Mr
Saatchi, a senior official of the company said: 'I have been authorised to
say the following: 'Most people in the company would accept that Maurice has
a value but not as chairman and not on the board''.
Dissident shareholders say they will call an extraordinary meeting to force
Mr Saatchi out, if the board does not ask him to stand down.
'Morale here would be devastated if we go through eight weeks of a public
campaign to unseat Maurice, ahead of the meeting,' a director said.
Meanwhile, one of the company's leading customers, Sir Colin Marshall,
chairman of British Airways, has intervened in support of Mr Saatchi. He has
written to Mr David Herro, of Harris Associates, the fund manager leading
the shareholders' revolt, saying that 'in the event that Maurice Saatchi was
no longer in a position to direct BA's advertising strategy we would
consider our position'.
Mr David Herro said more than 40 per cent of shareholders had contacted him
to back him.
Friends of Mr Saatchi said they feared shareholders were unaware of the
potential damage if Mr Saatchi were ousted. 'There is a serious risk that
Saatchi would lose the Mars and British Airways accounts,' one said. Those
represent about Pounds 50m or more than 5 per cent of Saatchi's annual
revenue.
Mr Saatchi has made clear to colleagues that he will quit the group rather
than accept a compromise proposal that he stand down to become chairman of
the advertising subsidiary, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising Worldwide.
He has also said he would resign rather than see the holding company change
its name, another demand being made by the dissident shareholders.
A change of holding company name, so that the 'Saatchi' brand is used only
by the advertising subsidiary, is also favoured by a growing number of
Saatchi executives.
Mr Saatchi would, however, agree to an official study into possible benefits
of a change in corporate identity.
The shareholders' campaign to oust Mr Saatchi was provoked by a proposal
that he receive a Pounds 5m option package. However, colleagues of Mr
Saatchi say Mr Herro gave approval in principle to such a package last May.

FT  16 DEC 94 / New Irish PM pledges to continue work for Ulster peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ireland agreed a new coalition government led by the conservative Fine Gael
party yesterday, ending a month of political uncertainty after a scandal
dragged down its Fianna Fail-Labour predecessor.
Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, supported by 85 votes to 74, becomes
Ireland's 10th prime minister, leading a coalition with Mr Dick Spring's
Labour party and the Democratic Left of Mr Proinsias De Rossa.
Mr Bruton, who succeeds Fianna Fail's Mr Albert Reynolds, said the
government's first national aim would be to sustain the Northern Ireland
peace process. In London, Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, said he had
sought an early meeting with the new Irish premier.
Mr Bruton is expected to have his first meeting with Mr Gerry Adams, the
leader of Sinn Fein, at today's session of the Dublin government's National
Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.
Mr Bruton told the Dail (parliament), his government would 'work ceaselessly
and sensitively to make peace a permanent part of our future'.
His election was welcomed by unionists in Northern Ireland. Mr Peter
Robinson, Democratic Unionist MP for East Belfast, said Mr Bruton had a
greater understanding of the Ulster Unionist position than most members of
the Irish parliament.
His desire to change articles two and three of the republic's constitution -
claiming territorial jurisdiction over Northern Ireland  - was a 'promising
backcloth' to his term in office, Mr Robinson said.
Mr Bruton conceded that the government was made up of parties whose 'origins
and policies' were very different. But he insisted that 'differences don't
have to pose a threat'. Fine Gael, a rurally based party with largely
middle-class support, will have eight ministers. Labour, which has projected
itself as a European-style secular party, will have six ministers - the same
number it had in the outgoing administration. However, Labour's Mr Ruairi
Quinn will take over the finance portfolio, the first time it has not been
held by the largest party.
Democratic Left, the successor of the Official IRA when the Provisional IRA
split to pursue the armed struggle in 1970, dropped its earlier insistence
on two cabinet positions.
The main points of the new government's agreed programme include moves to
keep public borrowing below 3 per cent of gross national product; tax cuts
for the low paid; a freeze on privatisation; a referendum on divorce; and a
commitment to the Northern Ireland peace process.
The breakthrough coincides with talks yesterday in Belfast between the
British officials and loyalist paramilitaries.
David Owen adds: In London, Mr Major said he was confident the new Dublin
government would wish to 'sustain together the work we have done over
Northern Ireland'.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Rover lifts production by 16.2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rover, the leading UK carmaker, increased its total vehicle production by
16.2 per cent year-on-year in the first nine months, according to figures
released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
Overall car output rose by 3.0 per cent in the first nine months to 1.075m
from 1.044m in the same period a year ago, and the society forecasts
continuing steady growth in production during the mid-1990s.
Higher car output by Rover - a subsidiary of BMW, the German carmaker -
together with the build-up of production by Toyota and Honda at their UK
assembly plants, helped to offset stagnant output at Ford, Vauxhall and
Peugeot and a sharp fall at Nissan.
The rise in Rover car and commercial vehicle output - to 355,419 from
305,831 a year ago - has been driven most importantly by the introduction of
its Rover 600 executive car range, launched in spring last year, as well as
by increasing sales of the Land Rover Discovery.
Rover is currently adding 1,450 jobs at its British plants in response to
strongly rising sales, in particular in export markets.
Mr John Towers, Rover group chief executive, said recently that output for
the full year was expected to rise to about 492,000 from 430,200 in 1993 and
404,900 in 1992. Production is expected to rise significantly above 500,000
in 1995.
Production at Nissan's Pounds 1bn Sunderland car plant fell by 28.2 per cent
during the first nine months to 143,000 from 199,000 in the same period a
year ago.
The company was forced to halve production for nearly four months until
early March with the elimination of its second shift in order to cut stocks
and to bring output into line with sharply lower demand in continental
Europe.
Production at Toyota's Pounds 700m assembly plant at Burnaston near Derby,
which began at the end of 1992, rose to 63,000 in the first nine months from
25,000 a year ago.
Commercial vehicle output has begun to recover strongly from recession this
year, albeit from a low level. Output in the first nine months at 165,161
was 16.7 per cent higher than a year ago. Commercial vehicle production has
been in a state of almost continuous decline since the end of the 1960s,
when it peaked at 466,000 in 1969. Production fell by 22.2 per cent last
year to 193,414, the lowest level of output since 1948.
Truck makers are raising production in response to strongly rising demand in
the domestic market with ERF increasing output by 26 per cent in the first
nine months and the Iveco group raising production by 20 per cent.
Output by Leyland Trucks was 60 per cent higher than a year ago, when the
former Daf group, which included the Leyland plant, went into receivership.
The operation was rescued by a management buy-out in the summer of 1993.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Pounds 10bn spent on treating water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 30 regional water companies in England and Wales have spent more than
Pounds 10bn to improve supplies and raise quality since the 1990-91
financial year, according to Ofwat, the regulatory body.
The figure, published in a report on the companies' financial performance
and investment, will stoke criticisms which arose earlier this year over
whether the industry is placing too much of its investment burden on
customers.
Some consumer groups and Labour politicians have claimed that charges have
been raised unnecessarily to fund ambitious investment programmes to improve
supplies and raise water quality to European Union standards.
According to the critics, the companies have financed much of their
investment through excessive charges so they could maintain high profits and
dividends after privatisation in 1989.
But Ofwat argues that the industry has borrowed heavily to finance long-term
spending. The industry's net debt amounted to Pounds 3.3bn at the end of
March - roughly equivalent to the companies' cash requirements since
1990-91. Moreover, almost Pounds 2bn more has been ploughed back through
retained profits.
The surge in borrowing has been reflected in rising interest charges.
Interest payments climbed from virtually nil in 1990-91 to about Pounds 200m
in the last financial year.
The Water Services Association, which groups the 10 biggest companies
handling both fresh and waste water, said about half the industry's
financial needs were now coming from external sources.
In a separate report, Ofwat revealed sharp differences in companies' charges
for delivering water. Costs varied from 41p per cu m at Hartlepools Water to
103p per cu m at Tendring Hundred Water, against an industry average of 58p
per cu m.
Welsh Water was fined Pounds 20,000 yesterday after the Saundersfoot, west
Wales, holiday resort was seriously affected by pollution.
Tenby magistrates heard that large quantities of sewage were discharged into
a stream then on to the beach where people were bathing.
Welsh Water admitted two charges under the Water Resources Act. It was also
ordered to pay Pounds 2,264 costs.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Curtain rises on the final act: The Italian prime minister's
position is becoming more perilous, as financial and political pressures
grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like the flow of lava spilling from a volcano, the accumulated errors of
eight months' government are overwhelming Silvio Berlusconi and his
rightwing coalition.
Following Mr Berlusconi's interrogation on Tuesday by Milan anti-corruption
magistrates, the government headed by Europe's first media
magnate-turned-politician could fall before Christmas. The exact timing will
be determined by the final passage of next year's budget through parliament.
But while the government looks certain to resign, no clear alternative has
yet emerged.
'We are in fact one step away from a 'general crisis': that breaking point
where the confused state of Italian democracy could precipitate a collapse
of the entire system,' warned Mr Ezio Mauro, the editor of La Stampa
newspaper, owned by the Agnelli family.
Tempers are running high in parliament, where verbal abuse has become more
aggressive as the world has been divided into friends and foes of the
government. Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League, has
turned from coalition partner into the prime minister's greatest adversary.
Mr Berlusconi is lashing out ever more desperately at his perceived enemies
 -Mr Bossi, the Milan magistrates, the communist-dominated left and even his
former fellow businessmen. Increasingly, 57-year-old Mr Berlusconi presents
himself as the victim, behaving like a latter-day King Lear cast loose in a
storm; a man 'more sinned against than sinning'.
'We are building up to a storm of unheard-of violence: one of those epic,
homeric storms,' observed Mr Giuliano Ferrara, minister for parliamentary
affairs and the government's spokesman.
The elements of the storm can be divided into the external and internal
pressures.
The principal external pressure comes from the financial markets. With
Italy's debt now more than 125 per cent of gross domestic product, the
country is enormously vulnerable to speculation against the lira.
The lira is already at an historic low, close to L1,050 to the D-Mark. Since
Mr Berlusconi took office in May, it has depreciated more than 8 per cent
against the D-Mark. The Italian risk factor is also reflected in the 4
percentage point differential between Italy's and Germany's interest rates.
The authorities might be forced to raise interest rates to defend the
currency; that would further increase the public sector deficit, which is
already 10 per cent of GDP. As a rule of thumb, each percentage point rise
in interest rates adds an extra L15,000bn in a full year to the Treasury's
budget.
Italy's political uncertainty has added to the doubts in the markets, with
fears that the government's programme for reducing the deficit in the 1995
budget will fail.
The budget was never more than the minimum necessary - it would have held
the deficit to L138,000bn, equivalent to 8 per cent of GDP. Now that aim has
been seriously weakened by the decision to remove pension reform from the
package of measures to head off a general strike planned for December 2.
Pensions are the single largest current spending item in the budget, and the
postponement of reform until next June will create a further six months of
uncertainty.
Even without the removal of the measures to cut the cost of pensions, the
budget targets would have been missed. The deficit reduction has been
undermined by a combination of higher than expected payments on Italy's huge
stock of debt, lower Treasury receipts this year, the cost of paying for
damage caused by November's disastrous floods in the north and the need to
provide funds for pension arrears after an expensive constitutional court
decision on the subject.
Mr Lamberto Dini, the Treasury minister, admitted this week that the budget
is effectively out of date and additional measures would be needed early
next year. Experts believe that a gap of at least L25,000bn will have to be
bridged, almost certainly by raising taxes, which Mr Berlusconi pledged not
to do in his election campaign.
The continued weakness of Italy's public finances at a time of political
turmoil means a rise in interest rates cannot be excluded. The prospect of
the damaging consequences of a fresh rate rise could determine the nature
and length of the impending political show-down.
All parties are agreed the budget must be approved rapidly, no matter how
imperfect its measures. Otherwise the lira, already under pressure in the
financial markets, could come under renewed attack.
'Once the budget is approved, Berlusconi should resign,' observed Mr Massimo
D'Alema, opposition leader and head of the former communist Party of the
Democratic Left. 'I have to accept that the government no longer exists.'
If the external pressures are financial, the internal ones are political.
First there is the increasingly anomalous position of Mr Berlusconi, who is
under investigation for corruption while running Fininvest, his business
group which is Italy's second biggest private company. He is alleged to have
known about the payment of bribes to members of the Guardia di Finanza, the
financial police, to ensure favourable inspections of the group's books.
Mr Berlusconi has rebutted the charges with vigour: 'Everything is based on
the presumption of knowledge of operational arrangements (in Fininvest
companies) which I never dealt with and could never have done, given the
well-known size of the group,' he commented combatively after his
interrogation by the magistrates.
He has also made clear his determination not to resign. 'It is my firm
intention not to back away from the task confided on me by the majority of
Italians in the mandate from the March 27 elections.'
This sense of a popular mandate is deeply imbued in Mr Berlusconi and feeds
his conviction that he can appeal directly to the electorate through
television, over the head of parliament. His ability to drum up support in
this way should not be underestimated since RAI, the state broadcasting
organisation, is now run by his supporters, and his three commercial
channels account for more than 85 per cent of the private television market.
But resorting to the media to survive merely focuses the spotlight on
another of the anomalies surrounding Mr Berlusconi, the conflict of interest
between his role as prime minister and his ownership of Fininvest. He has
been unable - or unwilling - to distance himself from Fininvest since he
took office.
Rather than improving, the situation becomes more entangled the longer he
governs. For instance, it is impossible to see how his government could
reform Italy's broadcasting system, where his dominant position has become a
matter of political controversy, without being considered partisan.
And although he is trying to use his position as prime minister to defend
himself against the scrutiny of the magistrates, their investigation relates
to Mr Berlusconi's time as a businessman, not as premier. He has failed to
explain why, as the founder and chief executive of Fininvest, he did not
interest himself in the visits of the Guardia di Finanza, especially in a
group that is structured in a cascade of tax-efficient companies.
Moreover, the case against him remains open for a full six months, dating
from the first warning on November 21 that he was under investigation. The
cloud of suspicion cannot be dispelled quickly.
Meanwhile there is now open war between Mr Berlusconi and the Milan
magistrates. Since October, inspectors of the justice ministry have been
checking on the behaviour of the Milan magistrates.
Mr Berlusconi and Mr Alfredo Biondi, the justice minister, insist they are
trying to ensure that proper judicial practices are being observed. The
magistrates have clearly abused the rights of citizens in interrogations and
in leaking documents to discredit individuals - not least Mr Berlusconi. But
these events are portrayed by the government's opponents as a determined,
self-interested attempt by the government to undermine anti-corruption
investigations.
In the past 10 days the confrontation has forced the resignations of Mr
Antonio Di Pietro, Italy's best-known anti-corruption magistrate, of an
appeals court judge and all 21 inspectors at the justice ministry. The
wounds are now being felt within the judiciary itself as people take sides.
The situation is such that there can be no peace between the Milan
magistrates and the present government. And it is a battle in which each is
seeking to disable the other.
Another equally damaging institutional conflict has raged between the prime
minister and President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro since Mr Berlusconi took office
in May.
The mutual mistrust is every day more apparent. Mr Berlusconi does not
prevent his ministers from raining insults on the president. Nor does he
dissuade them from making dark threats to raise embarrassing questions about
his Christian Democrat past as interior minister.
By failing to reach a modus vivendi with President Scalfaro, Mr Berlusconi
has alienated the figure whose constitutional position allows him to play
the central role in the next stages of the crisis - the formation of a new
government or the dissolution of parliament. The hostility between the prime
minister's office and the presidential palace has passed a point of no
return.
A similar point has been reached in Mr Berlusconi's relations with Mr Bossi.
The League leader has long been playing the opposition within the rightwing
coalition. This week he voted against the government for the first time and
has effectively changed sides. Mr Bossi has never felt comfortable in the
same alliance as the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco
Fini.
But there has been a far greater contradiction at the heart of the
coalition. Mr Bossi has never had an interest in anything but the short-term
success of the Berlusconi government. The League is a lesser partner in the
coalition, and Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement was instrumental in
providing backing to elect the bulk of Mr Bossi's deputies. A durable
government could submerge the identity of the League in that of its larger
partner.
By threatening to break the alliance, Mr Bossi has retained the League's
identity. But this tactic cannot be maintained throughout the life of a
legislature, and Mr Bossi's threats to leave the government once the budget
is approved look likely to come to pass.
The present government can be brought down only in parliament, but the
League's defection to the opposition would provide the necessary numbers to
bring this about. Until now the League has hesitated because Mr Bossi fears
early elections and has failed to secure an alternative alliance. But Mr
Bossi has now pushed himself into a position where he cannot draw back.
Mr Berlusconi is the only political leader to favour early elections, with
the reluctant endorsement of his chief ally, Mr Fini. However, President
Scalfaro is likely to explore other options first, if only because the
electoral laws need to be changed to remedy the faults of the reformed
system first used this year.
There is also a strong practical objection to early elections, since this
would entail at least three months of uncertainty during the preparation and
campaign - the most alarming scenario for the financial markets.
One alternative would be a restyled version of the present government. It
would be headed by Mr Berlusconi but be less reliant on the MSI/National
Alliance and would have links to the centre parties that are guardians of
the Christian Democrat heritage. The League might accept this formula; and
significantly Mr Berlusconi's Channel 5 ran a telephone vote on Wednesday
that showed 50 per cent in favour.
But the idea suffers from being linked to the figure of Mr Berlusconi, whose
position is clouded by the judicial investigation into his affairs. No other
leader could easily hold this type of coalition together, not least because
Forza Italia remains little more than a Berlusconi supporters' club.
This leaves various forms of a broad-based government of national unity as
the most stable option. Such a government would have the limited and clearly
defined task of tackling Italy's public finances and preparing a new
electoral law - not unlike the 1993-94 administration of Mr Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi.
As the showdown approaches, the most optimistic tone has been sounded by Mr
Ferrara, the government's spokesman: 'When venom thickens the air forcing
great storms to break, this cleans the atmosphere.'
Instability may lead to political regeneration. But the Italian political
system, caught between the need for change and the instinct for
self-preservation, is unlikely to produce a clear-cut solution.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Bonn's balance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last spring France and Germany announced with some fanfare plans to
co-ordinate their consecutive presidencies of the European Union - joined, a
few months later, by Spain. Their ideas included turning the main pillars of
the Maastricht treaty into reality - including fleshing out a common foreign
and defence policy and founding Europol, a police force to co-ordinate the
cross-border fight against crime.
They wanted to lay the foundations for enlargement of the EU to the east,
balanced by a Mediterranean policy to stabilise the union's southern flank,
a vital French concern. And they wanted to provide a launch-pad for a big
new step towards integration at the inter-governmental conference in 1996.
In the event, progress during the first six months, the German presidency,
has been painfully slow on all fronts. No fewer than 28 meetings held on
Europol - a plan which would be popular with a European electorate worried
about drug-trafficking and organised crime - have produced no decisions at
all.
Common foreign policy is bedevilled by Bosnia. As for eastern enlargement,
the summit in Essen produced a few sign-posts, but little substance.
In the first place, Germany was hopelessly distracted by its own general
election. And once that was over, the looming date of the French
presidential election next spring seems to have paralysed progress. Given
those circumstances, it is scarcely surprising that Germany's handling of
its presidency came in for stiff criticism from the European parliament on
Wednesday.
Bonn was taken to task for a range of problems from vacillation over EU
enlargement to its failure to stem refugee flows from ex-Yugoslavia.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl responded robustly, telling MEPs to do more to
persuade their governments to support German-backed projects like Europol.
Clearly, some hopes for the EU presidency were pitched too high. This may
partly have reflected Mr Kohl's own optimistic forecasts in advance of
Germany's October election. Differences of opinion with France and the EU's
southern members about the pace of eastern enlargement have become
increasingly evident in recent months.
Mr Kohl may have sound domestic reasons for caution about setting firm
timetables for accession by the countries of central and eastern Europe  -
not least the financial sacrifices that early eastern membership would
demand from German taxpayers and farmers.
The EU, too, needs to take seriously the fears of southern states of
negative repercussions from the tilt to the east.
But all 12 current members have explicitly committed themselves to accepting
a further enlargement after Austria, Finland and Sweden join next month. It
is high time that the Union started to focus on the measures it needs to
adopt before such an enlargement can take place, and not simply on the
adjustments required of would-be new members.
Given Germany's concern with eastern Europe, the German presidency should
have been a high point for enlargement hopes to the east. The next three EU
presidencies - of France, Spain and Italy - will inevitably be more
preoccupied with the south, and none has much incentive to press the case of
the easterners. France will also be totally absorbed in its own presidential
elections. The 1996 IGC looks less likely to produce a grand, concerted push
for deeper integration than a continuing muddle.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Avoiding a poll tax on wheels
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Critics of UK rail privatisation characterise it as a 'poll tax on wheels',
a project so unpopular it will have to be abandoned. Recent events give
credence to that verdict. But this need not be the outcome, provided there
is both more experimentation and more careful thought.
This privatisation is running into political buffers. First, a report by
railway experts to the transport select committee warned that inadequate
subsidies could lead to the closure of half the rail network. Second, the
franchising director unveiled his passenger service requirements, which
confirmed fears that services could be cut. Finally, a leaked Department of
Transport memo has revealed Whitehall concerns that the process is advancing
too fast.
These developments have increased the pressure on the government to back
down. This is hardly surprising since public support for rail privatisation
has never been more than lukewarm. One possible response is that no
privatisation was popular initially, but most seem justified in retrospect.
Yet this government is hardly in a good position to persist with an
unpopular policy. Furthermore, there are good reasons even for supporters of
the privatisation to be concerned.
This does not mean that the privatisation is a bad idea. The rail system
does urgently need an injection of private sector management, since British
Rail's performance was notoriously unsatisfactory. It could do with private
sector capital as well, since sufficient public funds will not be
forthcoming. Separating train operations from ownership of the track and
stations appears complicated. But it has parallels in the airline and
shipping industries and is being applied with success abroad. That the idea
is new is hardly a cogent objection.
Closer examination of what is happening shows that many fears are misplaced.
The minimum service requirements will allow train operators to cut services,
but there never was any guarantee of service levels under British Rail. In
any case, it cannot make sense to insist that the present network and
service be maintained in full. The new system will also provide commercial
incentives for operators to run more trains if they are profitable. In
addition, tight controls are proposed on commuter fares, which should
assuage the concerns of these politically influential, captive passengers.
Nevertheless, there is a strong case for proceeding with caution. There are
legitimate worries, for example, about the extent to which tickets will be
available for journeys across the rail system. The prospect that
long-distance tickets will be available only from a 'core' group of main
stations is also a concern.
Yet the really big mistake is to proceed with franchising most of the
inter-city network, and a large part of London's commuter services, in one
go. The first franchises ought to serve as an opportunity for learning, with
the inevitable mistakes avoided in future contracts. Among other things, the
level of subsidies - the indefinite continuation of which is justified by
the failure to charge the social costs of competitive modes of transport -
must be adjusted in the light of experience with the franchises. In
addition, the privatisation of Railtrack, which owns the stations and track,
is being pushed too fast.
If ever there was a case for trial and error, this privatisation is it. The
government must be more cautious. Otherwise, the great train privatisation
will go the way of the poll tax.

Forget Trafalgar House's Nigel Rich or his big boss, Simon Keswick. The man

biggest business, its engineering division.
A fortnight ago, he handed in his notice to take up a new job as chief
executive of ScottishPower - which also happens to be very interested in
what happens to Northern Electric. Not only does Robinson know where the
weak spots are in Trafalgar House's brand new top management team - and
there are still a few - but he should also have a pretty good idea of Traf's
game plan for Northern Electric. Hard to imagine an old pro like Lord Hanson
letting such a key player slip away at such a crucial time.

Perfectly understandable if Warburg's Sir David Scholey does not feel like
exchanging Christmas cards with Lazards' vice-chairman John Nelson. Nelson,
one of the City's shrewder merchant bankers, has been making life miserable
for SG Warburg of late. First, he was one of the main reasons why GEC chose
Lazards rather than Warburg in its bid for VSEL, despite the fact that
Scholey is a GEC director.
When there are so few big bids around, it might have helped Warburg impress
Morgan Stanley a bit more if GEC's Lord Weinstock had given it the nod. Now
Warburg's planned get-together with Morgan Stanley has collapsed because
Warburg's Mercury Asset Management subsidiary dug its heels in over the
price. Guess who was advising MAM? Much more of this and Warburg will have
to make a takeover bid for Mr Nelson. Better to have him on the inside etc,
etc.

Will UN Security Council meetings ever be the same again, now that Sir David

Always ready with a crisp warning for Saddam Hussein or (rather less
credibly) to the Bosnian Serbs, the Humphrey Appleby look-alike has rather
become the dominant figure in the council since 1992, when his US colleague
Tom Pickering was exiled to India.
Pickering was replaced by the black but otherwise colourless Ed Perkins,
followed by Clinton confidante Madeleine Albright, for whose inexperience
Hannay felt the need to cover, sometimes in an offensively obvious manner.
But then, subtlety was never Sir David's strong suit.
The typical self-confident Wykehamist, his abrasive bonhomie was given
particularly free rein when he represented Margaret Thatcher's government at
the EC between 1985 and 1990.
Hannay hands over to Sir John Weston, currently Britain's man at Nato.
Briefly political director of the Foreign Office during the Gulf war, Sir
John is credited with having persuaded John Major to intervene on behalf of
the Kurds. Lady Weston had watched what was happening on television, and
gave him no peace until he did something about it. Presumably she will not
be underemployed during her husband's next posting.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Gas cloud
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At the very least, British Gas's plans to cut the wages and holidays of some
of its least-well paid staff is a public relations disaster. The move, just
weeks after the group awarded its chief executive, Mr Cedric Brown, a pay
rise of 75 per cent, also suggests a degree of misjudgement and naivety
within the company's top management that does little to justify exceptional
salaries.
The timing could hardly be more controversial. Gas prices will rise above
inflation next year, and public resentment is running high, as shown by the
government's failure to raise value added tax on heating fuel.
British Gas explains the cuts in wages of its showroom staff - and the
closure this year of 157 of its 423 showrooms - by the need to drag its
retail arm into profit. As part of its modernisation, the cuts may make
sense. The domestic market has matured, and gas is no longer battling
fiercely to win market share. Wages and staffing levels in the showrooms
need to be aligned to the high street, not to British Gas's internal scales.
But the group has been extraordinarily insensitive to public and political
opinion. Even after a decade, the case for privatisation of utilities is
hardly won in the public mind. The popular image of the legacy of
privatisation is not of improved services but of rising water bills - and
now of Mr Brown's Pounds 475,000 pay packet. Yet British Gas cannot afford
to waste goodwill; it wants the Gas Bill now before parliament to spread the
costs of providing universal access across all suppliers.
The group's latest advertising trumpets the flexibility of gas, with the
slogan 'don't you just love being in control?' But its executives may now
find, having turned up the political heat, that they cannot turn it down.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Personal View: Taming the wild beast of derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALFRED STEINHERR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The explosive growth in financial derivatives since the early 1980s has been
one of the most profound structural de-velopments in financial markets since
the organisation of limited-liability equity markets early last century.
Derivatives - financial instruments that derive their value from that of an
underlying asset or index - have added another dimension to business
decision-making. Derivative finance has commoditised the risk of price
changes in many common financial assets, such as equity, fixed income and
foreign exchange.
For example, the risk of losses through exchange rate movements can be
separated from the risk of price movements in foreign assets. A stream of
variable interest rate payments can be converted into fixed rate payments.
The risk of an interest rate rising or falling by more than a set amount can
be bought or sold.
A fundamental economic benefit of this development is that it makes it
easier to quantify the financial risk in any venture and thereby produces
better allocation of resources. However, this happy picture has been marred
by the growing realisation that the new industry has burst upon a
regulatory, supervisory, accounting and legal stage that is not suited to
deal with it.
In particular, the traditional supervisory and regulatory structure for
large banks - the key players in derivative finance - is ill-equipped to
deal with the problem. The existing focus on periodic examinations of
on-balance sheet transactions is inadequate to deal with an environment
where the on- and off-balance sheet positions change so fast that even
end-of-day positions are no longer sufficient measures of an institution's
risk profile.
There is also a fear that markets have become less transparent and more
interconnected, that derivative business is unduly concentrated in a small
group of dealers (some of the big investment banks and securities firms) and
that derivative markets are critically dependent on uninterrupted liquidity
in the markets for the underlying assets. These have given rise to concerns
that problems in the derivatives markets could deal serious shocks to the
financial system.
The regulatory and supervisory response has so far focused on refining
capital requirements, improving supervisory oversight and increasing
disclosure. Although this approach is a step in the right direction, it does
not deal with the basic issue, namely that derivative finance has
fundamentally changed the balance between regulators and financial
institutions in favour of the latter. Instead, emphasis needs to be put on
fostering the growth of a framework for derivative markets that shifts
responsibility for the control and management of risk back into the private
sector.
One of the most notable institutional features of derivative finance is that
it is currently provided by two types of market organisations: the organised
futures exchanges and the providers of over-the-counter derivatives such as
banks. The OTC operators account for about two-thirds of notional values in
outstanding obligations.
What makes this surprising is the similarity between a large proportion of
the contracts sold by each type of organisation. The logical step in
developing a reliable market framework would be to persuade a large part of
the OTC derivative activity to shift into self-regulatory clearing houses or
exchanges - as has happened in other financial markets.
The major advantage of OTC operations is customisation - the products are
tailored for the customer. However, most of the forward exchange and swap
contracts involve little such tailoring. It is estimated that 60-70 per cent
of outstanding OTC contracts could be handled by standardised contracts on
the exchanges.
Many of the leading OTC dealers have taken steps to improve their risk
management. However, risk to the financial system is generated by the weaker
traders and not the best-managed ones. It would be preferable to reduce the
risk through the self-regulation imposed by exchanges, which maximise
liquidity by standardisation.
The importance of derivative markets to the stability of the financial
system suggests that there is a public interest in increasing their
transparency, integrity and liquidity. The playing field should therefore be
tilted away from the OTC markets, which escape relatively lightly under the
present regulatory structure, to induce migration to organised exchanges.
This could be done by increasing capital requirements for banks that take
derivative positions, so that they are as costly as positions taken through
derivative exchanges.
Finally, the increase in transparency would reduce systemic risk. The high
credit ratings of exchanges, their lower transaction costs and higher
liquidity would provide additional impetus to sustained growth in demand of
derivative products by end-users.
The OTC market would retain its important innovatory function, and offer
contracts for which demand is not large enough for exchange trading. But
lower trading costs, economies of scale from liquidity and the low systemic
risk pushed trading in equities - originally also an OTC operation - on to
exchanges. This will also happen for derivatives, and the sooner the better.

FT  16 DEC 94 / When the charm wears thin: Why Maurice Saatchi has angered
some shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cabinet ministers in Her Majesty's government receive flowers from Maurice
Saatchi, paid for by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, every time they change jobs.
The chairman and founder of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi has made a career - and a
personal fortune - out of charming the rich and powerful. Institutions as
diverse as the Conservative party, Mars and British Airways place their
advertising business with the firm, in part because of the personal
relationship between their top people and Mr Saatchi.
However, Mr Saatchi will today have to use all his persuasive powers to
prevent the Saatchi board - which contains such corporate notables as Sir
Peter Walters, former BP chairman, and Sir Paul Girolami, former Glaxo
chairman - from succumbing to shareholder pressure to have him removed.
The company's biggest shareholders, led by Mr David Herro, a 33-year-old
fund manager at the Chicago-based Harris Associates, have warned directors
that, if Mr Saatchi does not stand down at a board meeting today, they will
call an extraordinary meeting to force him out.
Some directors argue that Mr Herro represents only a minority of the group's
owners. But it is a substantial minority. Mr Herro's own fund controls 9.8
per cent of Saatchi's equity. His previous employer, the State of Wisconsin
Investment Board, controls 8.5 per cent and is backing his stand.
Other US funds with him are General Electric Pension Trust, with 6.5 per
cent, Tiger Fund Management, with 2 per cent, and Grantham Mayo, with 3 per
cent.
From the UK, unit trust group M&amp;G - owner of 5.25 per cent - last week
joined Mr Herro in expressing considerable dissatisfaction with Mr Saatchi.
Mr Herro says that a further substantial shareholder has said it can be
counted alongside the dissidents. He believes that more than 40 per cent of
the group's investors are committed to ousting Mr Saatchi, and that a formal
poll would see the odds heavily stacked against his survival.
Carrying out such a poll, during the seven weeks before an extraordinary
meeting could be held, would do great damage to the company - and to morale
 -in a people business. For this reason, Mr Herro is convinced that the
board will 'do the right thing'.
Shareholders' ire has been aroused by several factors. For 10 years after
the company came to the stock market in 1975, investors who backed Mr
Saatchi and his brother made a lot of money. However, the shares have fallen
98 per cent against the market in the nine years since he stepped up from
chief executive to chairman.
His huge ambition - whose extreme manifestation was his never-consummated
plan in 1987 to buy Midland Bank and Hill Samuel merchant bank - was mostly
to blame.
Mr Saatchi was not content with being just an advertiser, albeit the world's
biggest one for a brief period after the 1986 acquisition of the US Ted
Bates agency. In a shopaholic's spending spree, Saatchi bought management
consultancy groups, public relations firms and a range of marketing
businesses, on the bogus theory that companies would want to purchase all
their media and consultancy requirements from a single purveyor.
To finance this expansion, he used the latest financial devices, including
issuing bonds committing the company to a substantial deferred cash payment.
The consequence was a near-disastrous postponement of the true cash cost of
these acquisitions to the turn of the decade - or the middle of possibly the
worst ever advertising recession.
The company escaped collapse only after a painful and complicated financial
reconstruction, which involved raising new money and reorganising the
balance sheet, in 1991.
The group also gained a down-to-earth chief executive, Mr Charles Scott, who
could control costs while Mr Saatchi concentrated on playing the elder
statesman, exploiting his legendary corporate contacts to win new business.
That was the theory until the end of last year, when the Saatchi board took
two actions that infuriated Mr Saatchi, according to his colleagues. On Mr
Scott's advice, the board agreed that the chairman and holding company staff
should vacate their stylish but expensive Mayfair head office - saving more
than Pounds 1m a year - to move in with the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising
subsidiary in London's Fitzrovia.
It was also decided that Mr Saatchi's enigmatic brother Charles - the much
vaunted 'creative' talent of the siblings - should leave the board.
Soon after that, a series of stories began appearing in newspapers about an
alleged feud between Mr Saatchi and Mr Scott, with Mr Saatchi reported to
believe that the 'bean counter' Scott had 'not delivered'.
It later emerged that Mr Saatchi had hired a personal public relations
adviser, Mr David Burnside, the pugnacious former public relations head of
British Airways.
Mr Herro, a supporter of Mr Scott, was outraged. 'My concern about Maurice
started with this extraordinary press campaign,' Mr Herro says. He became
even more furious when he learnt that Mr Saatchi had submitted Mr Burnside's
bill to the company. 'The company has told me it did not pay,' Mr Herro
says.
Meanwhile a debate was raging in the press about why Saatchi was doing worse
than rivals such as WPP. Was it poor operations management (Scott's
responsibility) or failure to win new clients (Maurice's role)?
Peace broke out between Scott and Saatchi in the spring, when the company
said both would stay on. As part of the settlement, Mr Saatchi appeared to
respond to the widespread investor campaign against long contracts for
public company directors. He dropped his five-year rolling contract worth
Pounds 625,000 a year for a three-year fixed-term arrangement, paying Pounds
200,000 annually. The company had become '100 per cent politically correct',
Mr Saatchi said at the time.
But Mr Saatchi's new package did not appear so PC to Mr Herro and other
shareholders when they learnt that a new 'super-option' package was being
negotiated for him, which breached guidelines laid down by the Association
of British Insurers, the fund management lobby group.
The company's remuneration committee, chaired by Sir Peter Walters, offered
Mr Saatchi options worth eight times his old salary of Pounds 625,000, which
would have given him a Pounds 5m profit in three years if the Saatchi share
price reached 300p (compared with 153 1/2 p yesterday).
The views of the company's biggest shareholders were solicited privately.
The unambiguous response from those controlling more than 40 per cent of the
shares was hostile.
Meanwhile, Mr Saatchi found himself isolated from shareholders, company
executives and directors on a different issue, that of whether his surname
should be dropped from the masthead of the holding company.
Many of them feel that like 'Thatcherism' - a brand that Mr Saatchi helped
to create - the 'Saatchi' name has passed its sell-by date for the holding
company, if not for the advertising subsidiary, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Advertising Worldwide.
They feel that the development of subsidiaries such as Bates, which do not
have 'Saatchi' in their brand names, is stifled: when they win a client, the
success is usually described as a 'Saatchi' achievement.
Mr Saatchi, however, has told colleagues that removal of his name from the
holding company masthead would force his resignation.
Whether he has the luxury of choosing to go - rather than being forced out -
he will learn today. A colleague summed up the dilemma facing the board:
'Like Thatcher's colleagues, directors have to decide whether to put their
personal loyalty to him ahead of the good of the company.'

FT  16 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Shareholders must exercise pay power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr EDWARD LEIGH MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The problems surrounding shareholder control of executive salaries were
accurately and extensively reflected in your leader ('Can pay, will pay',
December 6).
I am glad to hear that the government intends to act, as this was an issue
which I addressed in a policy pamphlet which I published on November 28. I
said there that the way forward was to empower shareholders. Two days later
the prime minister told the House of Commons that he was prepared to
consider a similar solution.
In my pamphlet, Responsible Individualism, I wrote that the public is
justifiably suspicious when executives raise each other's salaries in a
round of mutual pocket-lining. Especially since many of them perform roles
more akin to ministers presiding over large bureaucracies than to genuine
entrepreneurs who innovate and create wealth and jobs.
It is indisputable that capitalism and the market are the most effective
systems to generate wealth and improve the material well-being of the
nation. But man cannot live by those alone; a sense of right and justice
must also be part of the equation. Politicians should give a lead.
The issue cannot be dismissed by the simple argument that British companies
must be free to offer world-class salaries. There has been a real public
outrage and that is something companies and government ignore at their
peril. There is an important moral dimension and it is this which has been
missing on recent economic policy. A sense of duty and service on the part
of executives and a sensitivity to the feelings of those on low wages would
not go amiss.
I do not advocate the Labour remedies of intervention and state regulation.
We should empower shareholders - who, after all, own the companies and
employ the managers - to enable checks to be placed on what the public
suspects are unnecessarily large pay packages.
This can be achieved, first, by fiscal measures to encourage direct share
ownership - something lacking at present; and, second, by legislation to
ensure that City institutions take due note of the views of the beneficial
owners of the shares they nominally hold.
I recognise there are difficulties in devising a mechanism by which the
latter could be achieved, but it should be possible to introduce a legal
system, however rough and ready, which would make fund managers respond to
the opinions of the millions of investors whom they represent.
We should trust the people in this respect. The public is bright enough to
know when they need adequately to reward an entrepreneur who boosts their
dividends, asset values and pensions, but jaundiced enough to recognise

FT  16 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: New jobs orthodoxy not reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN SHELDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It was a refreshing change to see a combination of common sense and
healthy scepticism in Richard Donkin's piece on the 'end of jobs for life'
debate ('Don't throw away those gold watches', December 14).
The zealots of the New Right have, until now, managed to create a new
orthodoxy in the reporting of the world of work by mixing in a teaspoonful
of truth with a barrel load of half-baked, politically driven science
fiction.
In this brave new world, everybody is (or will soon be) a tele-worker on
short-term contracts, paid entirely on the basis of some form or other of
performance remuneration with an individualised relationship with the
employer, moving rapidly between different employers and types of jobs, all
requiring different skill mixes. Not only is this paraded as fact, but as
desirable from the point of view of both individual employee and employer.
Away from Star Trek, this is far from the reality, but there is a danger
that it will become reality by default. I have lost count of the number of
times that senior civil servants and ministers have repeated with tedious
regularity that 'the old days with jobs for life have gone for ever' and
then make some reference to the latest headline-grabbing burial of lifetime
employment as though it was justification for this or that cutback or
privatisation.
This represents the real use of the set of anecdotes and impressionistic
observations that masquerades as a theory of trends in working patterns. It
serves as an academic cover for the conscious political decision to attack
conditions of service, particularly in the public sector - and to increase
insecurity at work.
As Richard Donkin's article suggested, as a personnel strategy it is as
damaging to employers as employees. Nothing is inevitable here and one of
our objectives as a trade union is the preservation and further creation of
real, secure employment options.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Imperative to modify ro-ro ships
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir WILLIAM BARLOW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the past few weeks two disasters at sea have warranted front-page
headlines in the press. In the sinking of the ferry Estonia, more than 900
lives were lost; following the fire on the Achille Lauro cruise ship, almost
all of the 1,000 passengers were saved.
The reasons? The roll-on, roll-off (ro-ro) design of the Estonia caused it
to capsize completely in a few minutes with no time for evacuation; the
Achille Lauro remained upright and afloat for many hours, with ample time
for evacuation.
There must be an overriding objective to design new ships or modify existing
ro-ro ships such that, following a significant ingress of water, an
essentially upright position is maintained for at least 30 minutes to make
evacuation practicable. Passengers on ro-ro ships are entitled to expect the
same standards to ensure survival as those which apply to conventional
passenger vessels.
Engineering solutions are available and cost or operational disadvantages
must not be allowed to stand in the way of this entirely logical objective.
The Royal Academy of Engineering is examining the matter and will be
consulting shipowners among others.

Sir, I would like to reassure Mr Greg Perry (Letters, December 10/11) that
the European Commission does respect the payment delays suggested for member
states and business in its November 30 recommendation. The average delay for
all payments made by the Commission during the first 11 months of 1994 was
40.5 days, well below the 60 days recommended. Only a few of the
Commission's payments (less than 10 per cent) took longer than 60 days, and
in most cases these delays were the result of irregularities with the
invoices.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Arts: The Little Match Girl - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANA SOUTHWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After his radical adaptation of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray,
the thought of gay provocateur Neil Bartlett interfering with Hans Christian
Andersen's The Little Match Girl at the Lyric Hammersmith might send shivers
down most censorious spines. It is like Fagin leading one of our seasonal
institutions down a dark alley for some forbidden pleasure.
But in Leah Hausman's frothy production, fears of something untoward are
completely unfounded. This is undiluted child's play, aided and abetted by
the show's main attraction: the Britton brothers, Tim and Chris,
collectively known as Forkbeard Fantasy, doubling up as assorted snowmen,
nuns, cops and angels when they descend from heaven in their underwear on a
snow cloud. Their mission? To protect the Little Match Girl from the
yuletide afflictions of poverty and homelessness.
So far so kosher. All Bartlett can really be accused of is shoehorning
Andersen's slight, melancholic and sentimental story of the street urchin
who dies from exposure on New Year's Eve into a contemporary Christmas
musical. Unfortunately his ambition never quite catches fire. What we get is
an evening of sugary anachronisms cheerfully presided over by Terry Neason's
dear, dead old Grandma: an ample-bosomed Scottish matron who has been yanked
from the steps of Mary Poppins' St Paul's, airbrushed and relocated to West
London.
Against the backdrop of Penny Saunders' lurid cartoonscapes, Hammersmith is
turned into a Dickensian theme park. The council house penury of Sian
Reeves' Little Match Girl failing to contend with her grumpy, Sun-reading,
sofa-bound Dad (Steve Fortune) rapidly gives way to joyous cod-Victorian
street bustle when Grandma persuades Miss Match to go out and sell some Swan
Vestas.
Suspiciously mature and vocally shrill, Reeves' raven-haired, emaciated
heroine is a striking street ingenue. But there is too much of the artful
about her to take her plight seriously. 'First The Big Issue, now matches .
. . whatever will they think of next?' snarls Tim Britton's bemused Harrods'
grotesque, Griselda, exiting stage left pursued by a tottering skyscraper of
Christmas presents. Quite. It seems much more likely that Reeves has time
shares in her pocket rather than a handful of lucifers.
The uncomfortable parable, that not everybody is happy at Christmas, is
conveniently lost in the warm flush of Nicolas Bloomfield's tripping
Sondheim and Lionel Bart-sounding arrangements. Each song, like a struck
match, becomes a cue for one of the Match Girl's customised visions. This is
where sentiment and the Britton brothers' diverting pantomime are most
successfully spliced.
The first startling vision is an enormous, cuddly Pooh Bear; but the third
vision is the showstealer: an inspired piece of Alice in Wonderland with the
Brittons as two pieces of giant cutlery - (a sort of Basil Fawlty
knife-and-fork duet).
In this they champion the hurt feelings of an all-singing, all-dancing
Christmas dinner dominated by Steve Fortune's lugubrious giant Turkey,
supported by a three-part harmony of Mashed Potatoes (Liza Sadovy, Lindsey
Dawson and Simon Penman), and finally swamped by a children's chorus of
Brussels Sprouts (pupils from Brackenbury School).
The short second half fails to match this shameless ebullience. The final
fantasy scene, where the Little Match Girl is finally taken into heaven, is
a resistible piece of Bartlett campery with the entire cast conjugating in
Restoration wigs around a haystack posing as a Christmas tree. An 18 carat
piece of cutesiness; but a 22 carat piece of kitsch.
The Little Match Girl is at the Lyric, Hammersmith until January 21.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Let's keep Ashton's flame burning: Clement Crisp argues that
more of the great choreographer's work should be in the repertoire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Remembering Frederick Ashton's ballets - and Covent Garden's second
programme in tribute to him is called Ashton Remembered - is too nostalgic
for my taste. What we must see is Ashton, the man we know from his
choreographies, alive on stage through scrupulous performance. When his
works are well performed, audiences understand the essential Ashton, what he
gave the Royal Ballet, what he wanted classical dancing to look like. Not
memories, but deeds.
The matter of preserving his work and his style (which was the man), seems
to me urgent. The Royal Ballet does not maintain a corpus of Ashton pieces
in repertory - a fault owed to an inadequate allocation of performances -
and I sense that schooling in Ashtonian nuance, vital matters of posture,
precision and clarity of execution, is not always careful. The Royal Ballet
no longer speaks Ashton's poetry as well as it does Forsythe's rap.
There sometimes seems a prettiness, an almost fatal charm, in Ashton
ballets, as with the fairies in The Dream or Cinderella, or the skaters in
Les Patineurs. But the prettiness is not over-sweet, and sustaining every
charming moment is a master's craft. (The scherzo in The Dream is a miracle
of composition matching Mendelssohn's airy genius). Ashton should be second
nature to our dancers, though recent disastrous casting in Symphonic
Variations, with performers so physically unsympathetic to its style that
they dismantled the piece, show how easy it is to destroy his work.
The good things about the Ashton Remembered bill, as I saw it at the week's
end, is that The Dream has been well revived, and Facade has, at last, a
Dago worth watching. The Dream was at its gossamer best. Bruce Sansom is a
commanding Oberon, classically sure. Peter Abbeglen is a delightful, because
innocent, Bottom. The fairy legions are quick-footed, deliciously melting in
pose. The lovers are freshly funny, and touching. Viviana Durante can spin
through Titania's steps with the best, but the role lacks radiance and that
wilful sensuality to illuminate the last duet. Tetsuya Kumakawa is a
technically astonishing Puck - the role has never been more ebulliently
danced - but his interpretation is a Kumakawa flag day. His bravura is
destructive because too emphatic.
Ashtonian fragments make up the centre of the programme. Two pieces have
been rescued from oblivion: the 'Air' pas de deux from Homage to the Queen,
which was the ballet's tribute in Coronation year; and the Raymonda duet
made in 1962 for Beriosova and Donald MacLeary. 'Air' is a lovely thing,
despite its clattering Malcolm Arnold score. After all the years, memories
came back of Fonteyn and Somes effortless and serene in it. It looked less
than serene with the first appearance of Deborah Bull and William Trevitt,
but it will handsomely repay their further study.
Raymonda brought Darcey Bussell to the stage after a long period of injury.
She has the expansive grace and grandeur that the dance needs - if not yet
all the stamina - and it was a delight to see her again, though if the piece
is to persist in repertory the ballerina's pink costume had better be sent
to the nearest Oxfam shop, and something less cute be confected. Zoltan
Solymosi was Bussell's cavalier - and rather cavalier in manner.
The luscious Thais duet - Massenet's swooning violin; an extremely high
sugar-content; the veiled vision of an Alexandrian courtesan; one lingering
kiss: can life offer more? - was done to a turn by Viviana Durante and
Stuart Cassidy. Divinest patchouli-scented hokum. And, unnecessarily, a tiny
Ashtonian sneeze - La chatte metamorphosee en femme - was also remembered.
It does nothing for Ashton's reputation, and not enough for its interpreter,
Maria Galeazzi.
The closing Facade was memorably led by Stephen Jefferies as the Dago. It
was a role made wildly funny by Robert Helpmann, compounded of sinuous wit,
brilliantine, diamond rings and devastated glances. No one, until Jefferies,
has come anywhere near Helpmann's satiric skill. Jefferies plays it deadpan,
and wonderfully so, and misses not one comic trick. He is so good that the
Noche Espanol, in which Helpmann used to saunter about in a maddened
pin-stripe suit, should be restored to the ballet for him. The revival was,
otherwise, decent - though the Popular Song could be more bored and
oh-so-slightly more relaxed. Ashton was properly remembered. Long may the
company remember its duty to him.
Ashton Remembered: Covent Garden on December 17 (mat &amp; eve).

FT  16 DEC 94 / Arts: Delicious French bonbons at the Wigmore Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Nash Ensemble has a well-established association with French music of
the 19th and 20th centuries. The group is celebrating its 30th anniversary
with six concerts of French music from Saint-Saens to Poulenc. Saturday
night's programme was a delicious selection of chocolates.
The choice for gourmands would probably have been Quatre poemes Hindous by
Maurice Delage, one of a small number of Parisian composers you could call
exquisite. Delage's settings are exotic, sharply imagined evocations of
India, scored for voice with a lovingly chosen ensemble of pairs of flutes,
clarinets, an oboe, harp and string quartet. The ample, weighty vocal
quality of the soprano Francoise Pollet seemed well-suited to these
languorous yet colourful pieces.
It was less so in Faure's song cycle La Bonne Chanson, in which a lighter
touch was needed. The version was Faure's own amplified one which adds a
string quintet to the piano - a patchy affair: Faure leaves out the piano
for long periods, then suddenly brings it in only to make the strings seem
superfluous. Faure himself preferred the songs without the strings.
An arrangement of Ravel's Sonatine seemed a second-best substitute for the
piano original, too. The Nash's harpist, Skaila Kanga, had adapted Carlos
Salzedo's arrangement for flute, cello and harp by replacing the cello with
a viola, spreading the interest more evenly. It fell short of redeeming a
lost cause, for all the artistry of Skaila Kanga, flautist Philip Davies and
viola-player Roger Chase.
After two slightly sullied masterpieces, the evening ended with one in its
pristine form. Faure's second Piano Quintet, completed in 1921, is
characteristic of the austerely searching quality of his later years. In
each movement the streamlined consistency of texture is a cover for
provocative, unexpected turns of melody and harmony. The first movement and
slow third movement somehow convey serenity and anguish at the same time.
The scherzo slithers by. The finale is surprisingly brief, as if impatient
for its radiant conclusion. A fascinating work, beautifully played.
On Tuesday evening Francoise Pollet returned to the Wigmore Hall in a
recital of French songs with the baritone Francois Le Roux and pianist Roger
Vignoles. Le Roux was warm but rather tremulous - fine in an untypically
fluttering song by Chausson (Les Papillons) but inclined to chop up Faure's
Le chanson du Pecheur and Chanson's baleful La caravane.
Pollet's voice production was blustery, too, though she sang Falla's
Seguidille with great gusto. The singers joined in Duparc's passionate duet
La fuite, adding Bizet's breezier setting of the same words as an encore.
Oddly they were most impressive when really stretched by the grand, arched
phrases of Berlioz's Les nuits d'ete. Pollet found her best form in the
tragic, statuesque appeals of Absence. The role allotted Vignoles was to
suggest the shimmer of the orchestral version with alarmingly few notes: it
was remarkable how evocative his contribution seemed.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Arts: The Immortal Hour - Music in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's future may lie in Europe, but its cultural heritage still means
far more to Americans than to anyone on the other side of the English
Channel. How else do you explain the enthusiasm with which English music is
championed in the US?
Frank Corsaro and Leonard Slatkin have both gone out of their way to
introduce unusual repertoire to New York. Corsaro, known this side of the
Atlantic for his stagings at Glyndebourne, has a penchant for neglected
British operas. Vaughan Williams's Hugh the Drover and Delius's Fennimore
and Gerda are among his recent credits in the US. He has now produced
Rutland Boughton's The Immortal Hour at the Juilliard Opera Center, of which
he is artistic director.
It would be wrong to suggest the production was a revelation, but it made
the best possible case for an opera which - despite the praise once heaped
on it by Elgar and Bax - today seems irredeemably dated in language and
musical idiom.
Boughton (1878-1960) and his Glastonbury Festival, where The Immortal Hour
was premiered in 1914, are among the more eccentric footnotes to English
musical history. Boughton propagated Celtic mythology, socialism and
communal art. The Immortal Hour was never intended for mass consumption -
and yet a cult of popularity developed around it in the 1920s, when it had
more than 500 performances in London. The last major revival, at Sadler's
Wells in 1953, was a flop.
With its simple, folk-song style, The Immortal Hour taps the mystery and
romance of Celtic legend. That is its appeal. The music amounts to little
more than a handful of undemanding, poorly integrated themes, one of which -
the a capella chorus 'How beautiful they are' - is sometimes heard
independently.
The story, set in a forest, concerns a king who falls in love with the fairy
princess Etain. He dies after she abandons him for Midir, Prince of the
Immortals. There are echoes of Rusalka, Lohengrin, Pelleas. New Grove
describes it as a 'poignant depiction of love's inevitable ending in loss'.
Edward Dent said it was 'one of those rare operas to which an inward
surrender has to be made'.
I failed to make that crucial step, but I could not resist the mesmeric
beauty of the Juilliard production, which tapped the otherworldly,
dream-like quality of the work. Corsaro focused on essentials - poised
acting, visual atmosphere - and paced the drama with unerring skill, using
the auditorium for theatrical processions and for those distant choruses
that are so peculiar to this piece. Stephan Olson's decor consisted of
little more than a raked platform. John Gleason's lighting was exquisite,
exploiting the shady depths of the stage and throwing into relief the soft
colours of Constance Hoffman's medieval costumes.
The cast included one outstanding talent - Jon Villars as Midir. His tenor
has a big, heroic quality which projects effortlessly, while retaining a
lyrical core. The technique is good. With his giant frame, Villars seems
destined for a major career. Peggy Kriha's Etain was properly ethereal, and
there were effective contributions from Brian Nickel as Eochaidh, the tragic
king, and Jamie Offenbach as Dalua, the sinister spirit who manipulates the
drama. Randall Behr conducted the student orchestra with clear commitment.
Slatkin's anglophile sympathies need no introduction here, but it is
reassuring to note that he does not reserve them for British audiences. US
radio stations regularly play his Vaughan Williams recordings, and his Saint
Louis orchestra is a fearless interpreter of contemporary scores, including
Peter Maxwell Davies's Worldes Blis and Nicholas Maw's Odyssey.
Due to an unfortunate programme clash I was forced to choose between Graham
Vick's new Shostakovich production at the Met and Slatkin's performance of
Odyssey at Carnegie Hall. I chose the Met and was amply rewarded - but it is
worth recording the reaction to Maw's orchestral epic, which was receiving
its New York premiere. The hall was well-filled, but there was a steady
exodus throughout the two-hour performance. The New York Times critic said
he was jealous of those who left, and characterised the score as 'a mighty
parliament with no majority'. Newsday described it as an ungainly beast
which 'only a mother could love'.
That probably says more about American conservatism than the inherent merits
of Maw's music, which is scarcely calculated to appeal to minimalists. But
there was unanimous praise for Slatkin and his orchestra, whom I heard the
following evening in Mahler's Third Symphony. Carnegie Hall is halfway
through a two-year Mahler cycle. Slatkin's clean, efficient performance may
have gone down well in Saint Louis, but it did not have the personality
which the occasion demanded in New York. The drama of the first movement was
matter-of-fact; the finale lacked depth and expression. Only the mezzo
soloist, Nancy Maultsby, seemed truly inspired.

There's something tawdry about Friday night's programming, as if those telly
execs had written off most of their viewers to post-work drinks or office
outings. Commuters who make it home by sixish in the misguided hope of
something good on the box can choose between a repeated American sitcom
(C4), a repeated Australian soap (ITV), puppets on BBC2 followed by a
repeated tec series a quarter-century old with the 'cult' label (that is, it
never achieved mass popularity) slapped on it. The news on BBC1 reassures us
that 'The Best Television in the World' still caters for adults at twilight.
So does Sounds of the Sixties (7.15pm BBC2). Try to work out why the Bee
Gees made it big and Procul Harum disappeared. Deploy the video to
circumvent the overlapping Harry Enfield and Chums (9.30pm BBC1) and The
Trial (9pm BBC2). The latter is too slick to contribute to the argument over
televising live court proceedings. Enjoy it, like any other soapish
entertainment set in the city that inspired the story of Jekyll and Hyde.

FT  16 DEC 94 / People: Aitken-Davies signals Railtrack's route
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has picked Richard Aitken-Davies to be director of
Railtrack's privatisation unit. It hopes to float the company, which has
taken over British Rail's tracks, signalling and stations, in the first
three months of 1996 but many questions remain to be answered before the
market can hazard its value.
Crucially, the level of charges it can levy on the train operating companies
has to obtain the Rail Regulator's approval early next year.
Aitken-Davies, 45, the man who will be most closely responsible for steering
Railtrack to a successful flotation, was formerly director of corporate
finance at PowerGen. He was financial controller at the state-owned CEGB
before it was broken up into PowerGen and three other companies in 1989. He
helped create PowerGen's capital structure and orchestrate its flotation. He
believes his experience with PowerGen will stand him in good stead at
Railtrack. 'They are both new companies formed from much larger
organisations with no track record of their own,' he says. 'We will have to
go out and persuade the City to invest.'
Aitken-Davies can claim practical, daily experience of the railway,
commuting from Raynes Park in south west London to Waterloo. He is also a
regular user of BR's InterCity services.
He stepped down from PowerGen in October intending to take a break from
business but the government's decision to bring forward Railtrack's
privatisation required a quick decision. He will join the company full-time
in January.
Aitken-Davies, a former councillor in the London Borough of Merton, devotes
some of his free time to acting as an external examiner in business studies
at Luton University.

Yorkshire Water yesterday appointed two non-executive directors less than
three months after rejecting smaller shareholders' attempts to elect a
similar candidate to the board.
Yorkshire has appointed Patricia Marsh, 48, (above) and Colin Cooke, 54, to
replace retiring directors, Tom Jackson and David Cramb.
Marsh, former managing director of Ace Coin Equipment, one of the UK's
largest distributors and manufacturers of electronic interactive machines
for the leisure industry, is a former member of the customer services
committee for the water industry regulator's Central region. Her appointment
follows the resistance of Yorkshire management and institutional
shareholders to the nomination of Diana Scott, former chairman of the Ofwat
Yorkshire customer services committee.
At the time, Yorkshire's board argued that Scott, who had the support of a
substantial number of smaller shareholders, did not have the relevant
business experience.
Yorkshire yesterday sought to stress Marsh's business qualifications, citing
her positions as non-executive director at Yorkshire-based Rosebys, the
households and soft furnishings retailer, and chairman of the Birmingham
Children's Hospital.
Cooke, who will join the board in the spring, is chairman of industrial
groups Triplex Lloyd and Fenner, and a non-executive of Ash &amp; Lacy and
British Dredging.

John Toyne, a transport consultant, has been appointed group managing
director of United Carriers which has upset investors by making two profits
warnings in the nine months since it was floated on the stock market.
Toyne, 51, replaces Michael Howe who was sacked last month following the
second profit warning. The first setback was blamed on too few parcels; the
second on too many. The shares - floated at 153p - were unchanged at 83p
yesterday. Alan Binks, who lost his job as chairman but retained the title
of chief executive, admitted at the time that the return to the market had
been 'a right mess'.
Toyne joined Imperial Group in 1965 and has spent over 20 years in
production and personnel management. As chief executive of Lowfield, a
grocery distribution business, he led the management buy-out from Hanson in
1988. Lowfield was acquired by Tibbett &amp; Britten in 1989 and Toyne sat on
the Tibbett board until last year. Most recently he has been operating as a
consultant in the transport sector and advising on a number of management
buy-outs.

<TEXT>
John Walmsley, the former finance director at Enterprise Oil, the UK's
largest independent oil explorer, has been appointed chief executive of
Hardy Oil and Gas as from January 1.
He will succeed Peter Elwes, who will become deputy chairman with a
full-time executive role. Elwes, who was Enterprise Oil's first chief
executive, interviewed Walmsley for his first job at Enterprise in 1984. The
two men say their long relationship should ensure a smooth transition.
Elwes has been head of Hardy since 1989, when the company was demerged from
Trafalgar House. He is due to retire in 1996. Walmsley was a director of
Enterprise Oil from 1984 to 1993 and departed several months before
Enterprise made its abortive bid for fellow explorer Lasmo.
His appointment at Hardy ends almost a year of industry speculation about
his future.
Walmsley says there is unlikely to be any big shift in strategy at Hardy; he
intends to follow the philosophy he developed at Enterprise of focusing on
core areas. In recent years the company has used the considerable cash
generated by its extensive North American operations to fund longer-term
projects in the UK sector of the North Sea.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Property: Docklands dreams again - The revival of optimism
in east London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Docklands is a barometer of the wider mood of the property market.
Grand plans for the regeneration of the area to the east of the City of
London - including the massive Canary Wharf development - were the products
of economic over-optimism.
The sudden downturn in the property market left docklands stranded, with its
unsettling mix of very old buildings, very new buildings and derelict sites.
Now the mood is one of cautious optimism. Attention is slowly turning from
damage limitation to future expansion.
This is most apparent in residential housing. The stock of empty homes in
docklands has been sold and a minor development boom is under way.
In business space, the over-building of the late 1980s will take longer to
sort out. Out of a total 13m sq ft of office space in docklands, about 4.5m
sq ft is still vacant - an occupancy rate of just 65 per cent.
Yet the overhang of space is steadily being eroded. More than 1m sq ft of
offices has been let this year, up from 800,000 sq ft in 1993, 332,000 sq ft
in 1992 and 192,000 sq ft in 1991.
Even Canary Wharf, the grandiose monument to the last development boom, is
on the way to being fully let. If negotiations with investment bank Barclays
de Zoete Wedd over 500,000 sq ft are successfully concluded, less than 1m sq
ft of the 4.5m sq ft development will remain unoccupied.
Mr Mike Bignell, head of property development for the London Docklands
Development Corporation, said that there was potential for another 10m sq ft
of office space in docklands, including further phases of Canary Wharf.
While the immediate priority must be to fill vacant space, the next phases
of development are already on the horizon as distant possibilities.
Survey evidence is certainly encouraging for docklands. A poll of central
London office occupiers by Jones Lang Wootton, the surveyors, found that
many companies were again thinking about moving out of the City and West
End, after a lull during the depths of recession.
The motivation was not outright cost, but the desire to rationalise sites
and bring operations under one roof. Favoured destinations were areas within
the immediate orbit of central London - including docklands - which could
offer modern space at prices a shade cheaper than the City or West End.
Against this background, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that
Canary Wharf and the LDDC will be dusting off development plans within a
couple of years.
Sir Peter Levene, chairman and chief executive of Canary Wharf for the past
18 months, recognises that the nature of his task is turning from crisis
management to long-term development.
With piecemeal lettings taking place all the time - this week the Personal
Investment Authority confirmed that it is sub-letting one floor of the
Canada Square tower - the existing buildings are achieving critical mass in
terms of tenants.
'The Jubilee Line extension will be with us by 1998, cutting journey times
into the West End to 15 minutes and linking us with Waterloo and London
Bridge stations. That will fundamentally change perceptions of Canary Wharf
and, in planning terms, is not far away,' commented Sir Peter.
The original design for Canary Wharf envisaged 12m sq ft of office space.
The foundations have already been dug for two further buildings - numbers 17
and 20 Columbus Courtyard - amounting to 340,000 sq ft.
Canary Wharf is also in negotiations which could lead to the development of
its remaining river frontage. The area is currently a temporary car park,
but permission has been granted for 1m sq ft of mixed use residential and
office buildings.
With so much empty space to let, at present the LDDC is confining its
development activity to non-office schemes. But that does not imply any lack
of activity.
In the mainly derelict Royal Docks area at the eastern extremity of
docklands, there are plans for an exhibition centre the size of Earls Court
and Olympia combined, an urban village, a university, science park, commerce
park and retail development.
Plans for the exhibition centre are the most advanced, with the LDDC set to
announce its favoured development partner within the next few weeks. Work is
scheduled to start on the 85-acre site before the end of next year.
Just over the water at West Silvertown, an urban village of up to 1,500
homes will be built by Wimpey, the housebuilder. Work should begin as soon
as the planning process - controlled by the LDDC rather than the local
authority - has been completed.
While the Royal Docks development programme will not add directly to the
stock of office space, it could give docklands critical mass in other
respects which would add to its attractions as a business location.
So what will be the effect on the City and West End if Canary Wharf and the
Isle of Dogs do - finally - establish themselves as London's third business
district?
Sir Peter Levene recognises that rents at Canary Wharf will have to remain
below those charged by the best buildings in core City locations. While the
differential will narrow as Canary Wharf gains credibility and improved
infrastructure, the availability of cheaper space to the east of the City
and West End will present real competition, especially for pre-let
developments.
'It is not safe to assume that docklands is not real competition and that
there will be no further development,' said Mr David Price, head of central
London agency for Hillier Parker, the surveyors. 'Paddington, King's Cross
or Spitafields would be preferred locations for some occupiers but not for
all. And they cannot turn the key on new development as fast as Canary
Wharf.'

FT  16 DEC 94 / Technology: The perfect pair of jeans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The search for the perfect-fitting pair of jeans can turn into a lifetime
crusade for some women, but a new software program is aiming to change that.
A Boston-based company called Custom Clothing Technology has developed a way
of making custom-fitting jeans by computer. The technology is being used in
US stores this month to measure customers for Levi Strauss jeans.
Sales assistants measure women's waist, hips, rise - the distance from the
front waistband, between the legs and up to the back waistband - and inside
leg. The measurements are entered into a computer which identifies a
prototype jean providing the closest match. Each participating store will be
stocked with hundreds of prototypes.
The customer tries on the prototype and after final adjustments the sales
person sends the information by modem to the company's Tennessee factory. A
computerised cutter puts out the pieces, which are then sewn together. Three
weeks later, the customer can pick up the jeans at the store, or have them
mailed. The jeans cost about Dollars 10 (Pounds 6) above the normal price
and will initially be available only at four stores.
But, by the end of January, Levi Strauss plans to offer the product in seven
other stores. Because sales people have to be trained in how to use the
program, however, it may take some time before the product is widely
available.
Sung Park, an ex-IBM software programmer and president of Custom Clothing
Technology, says he developed the program after spending time in Hong Kong,
where he could get a suit tailored in a day.
'I thought, wouldn't it be great if this were available to the mass market
in the US?,' says Park. 'And then I started wondering what the best
applications would be.' Park says he asked his female flatmates which piece
of clothing it was most difficult to find a good fit in, and the answer was
unanimous: jeans.
Park has an exclusive contract with Levi Strauss for tailored jeans, but he
is talking to other companies about custom-made bathing suits and men's
suits.
Levi Strauss says it will expand the product to men's jeans and other styles
for women if the tailoring proves popular.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Technology: Hot synthetics - Clothes manufacturers are
warming to man-made fibres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last decade has seen a revolution in cold-weather apparel, and winter
sports enthusiasts face an enticing but confusing array of synthetic
fabrics.
Choosing a wardrobe for cold-weather sports used to be straightforward.
Skiers, skaters, ice fishermen and ice climbers would pack silk or cotton
long-johns, wool sweaters and down jackets. The main concern was choice of
colour.
These days stores stock clothes made of materials with enigmatic names such
as Thermax, Polartec, Thinsulate and Akwatek. Most of the high-technology
fabrics are derived from polyester, a material formerly associated mainly
with cheap suits. Many consumers have a hard time believing in the new
high-performance polyesters.
'If you had told me five years ago that polyester would be the
state-of-the-art fabric for cold-weather clothes, I would have laughed,'
says James Riley, vice-president of design for Reebok, the sportswear
company, which has recently branched out into cold-weather apparel. 'But the
yarn has become so fine and the level of knitting so advanced that it has
become an incredibly flexible material.'
Polyester is manipulated in various ways to improve insulation. 'A main
focus in the industry has been keeping moisture away from the skin,' says
Catherine Salfino, market editor for DNR, a leading publication of the US
textile sector.
Long underwear is probably the weakest element in the traditional
cold-weather ensemble. Silk and cotton both absorb moisture easily and
although silk retains some of its insulating power when wet, damp cotton
loses nearly all its warming capability.
Early experiments with synthetic long-johns in the 1970s, however, were not
successful. Cold-weather retailers such as Patagonia used the plastic
polymer polypropylene in early high-technology models. The new material's
hydrophobic property kept users dry, but customers complained that their
plastic-derived long-johns melted in the clothes dryer. The fabric also had
an uncanny ability to retain odours.
Synthetic long-johns have come a long way since then. Patagonia now offers a
chemically-altered polyester called Capilene, which has gone through
anti-microbial treatment to help the fabric reject odour.
DuPont has also come up with some important new materials. ThermaStat and
Thermax are light-weight polyester materials that aim to trap air next to
the body while funnelling moisture to the outer layer, where it evaporates.
'These fabrics have a hollow chamber which helps them trap the warm air
close to the body,' says Arun Aneja, research associate with DuPont, 'and
air is a good insulator.'
Aneja says scientists got the idea for the material by studying polar bear
fur. 'Each strand of polar bear fur is hollow, and that gives the bear
incredible insulation.'
Reebok challenges the idea that moisture should be drawn away from the skin
in cold weather. The company is negotiating to make use of a new fabric,
Akwatek, developed by Comfort Technology. Akwatek is a polyester that has
undergone a chemical bath, and Reebok claims the material is equally
effective in cold weather or warm.
'In warm weather, Akwatek draws moisture away from the skin to the outer
layer, where it evaporates,' says Riley. 'But in cold weather, the warm
moisture stays next to the skin.'
Long-john technology may be impressive, but the textile industry hit the
jackpot with polar fleece. Malden Mills was one of the early innovators of
this material, which is now as ubiquitous on US streets as wool sweaters.
Polar fleece is popular because it is lightweight, rejects moisture and
dries quickly. Fleece, which entwines thousands of strands of microfiber
polyester, also feels soft and furry.
In outerwear, scientists still face a formidable competitor in down. 'It is
hard to beat down in terms of warmth-to-weight ratios,' admits Elizabeth
Volkers, brand-manager for the insulation material Thinsulate at 3M. But
once down is wet it offers almost no protection. It is also expensive and
bulky. 'Down jackets give people that Michelin man look,' Volkers says.
Insulating material for outerwear uses the hollow chamber concept.
High-technology fillers are honeycombs of fabric that trap warm air near the
body - one of the main challenges for scientists is to fit the highest
number of chambers in the smallest space. Thinsulate by 3M has emerged as
one of the most popular insulating materials, particularly for cold-weather
gloves and ski pants. Sports enthusiasts are still drawn to down jackets for
their lightweight comfort.
In terms of pure insulation power, fur is also difficult to beat. However,
the material's disadvantages are numerous: it is expensive, heavy and
controversial.
Over the next few years, several new technologies are expected in the
cold-weather apparel market. One of the latest is recycled fibres, which
manufacturers hope will prove popular with environment-conscious consumers.
3M plans to introduce recycled Thinsulate next year and recycled fleece is
already available.
Scientists have set their sights on developing bizarre-sounding miracle
fabrics. 'Technology today is based on passive fabrics, which work by
trapping heat generated by the body,' says Aneja. 'We are working on fabrics
that would harness energy from outside the body, such as visible light and
wind. We are trying to modify the polymer from which the yarn is made so
that it absorbs this energy.'
Aneja is also researching materials that adjust to temperature needs. 'We
would like to have a material that warms you when you are cold, cools you
when you are hot.' The most promising polymers in this area are elastic,
engineered proteins, which adjust to temperatures by creating a
temperature-sensitive biosystem.
Cold-weather clothing has already undergone a significant overhaul in recent
years and more technological change is on the way. The day may soon arrive
when ski holiday suitcases contain wind energy-harnessing jackets and
protein long-johns.

Measuring the speed of traffic flows in towns can be difficult because
vehicles are constantly stopping and starting.
Trafficmaster, a company that provides live traffic information to
motorists, believes it has overcome this problem by devising a system that
uses video cameras and number plate recognition software to track the speed
at which traffic moves through two points on the road.
A video camera photographs the number plates of a batch of cars, which are
digitised and transmitted by radio signal to a site further down the road,
where another camera photographs the targeted number plates.
Trafficmaster plans to install the equipment early next year on two London
routes. The company will destroy the sightings data after its use to protect
drivers' privacy.

An oversized, remodelled golf club could be the answer for golf enthusiasts
who yearn for greater accuracy and distance.
Spalding, a US equipment manufacturer, has designed a driver in which 20 per
cent of the weight of the head has been redistributed to its perimeter and
sole. The head's higher moment of inertia and lower centre of gravity gives
the ball less spin, allowing it to go further. The weight shift also makes
the driver more stable, helping the golfer attain greater accuracy.
The Top-Flite Magna Heat Driver, which is designed for mid-to-high handicap
golfers, will go on sale at the beginning of next year at around Pounds 99.

Toshiba, the Japanese electronics company, has developed an imaging
technique which could make it easier for doctors to examine brain function
abnormalities, such as epilepsy.
The technique is a form of magnetic resonance imaging, which monitors the
electromagnetic radiation given off by excited nuclei in a magnetic field.
The 'double echo' MRI method produces separate images of the neurons and
adjacent blood flows by relying on differences in the fall-off
characteristics of their wave signals. Toshiba believes the accuracy and
speed of the technique will assist doctors with diagnosis, presurgical
mapping and the exploration of complex brain functions.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Management: Keeping afloat - Anglian Water is undergoing a
radical overhaul in its drive for efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE BIRD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Smith, group managing director of Anglian Water (AW), works a 60-hour
week, including most Sundays and some Saturdays. Although he admits he's a
workaholic, he discourages his staff from over-working. 'It's a sign of
inefficiency,' he says.
Eliminating inefficiency has been the prime objective of an especially
controversial management change programme at AW during the past year. It has
involved 10,000 staff interviews, 900 redundancies and the elimination of
multiple layers of management. Some Pounds 60m of last year's Pounds 192.2m
pre-tax profits were set aside to pay for the exercise.
The scale of his task was illustrated this week when Ofwat, the UK water
industry regulator, singled out Anglian in its Levels of Service 1993-94
report as one of four companies 'where performance against one or more
measure falls short of what customers can reasonably expect' (on two of the
four criteria it scored well below average).
Nevertheless, Ofwat's observation that Anglian has 'reported significant
improvements already' will be an encouragement to Smith, who took over the
helm in 1990, the year after flotation. Drastic action has been necessary,
says Smith, because, despite its profitability, the company was still living
with big problems inherited from its public-sector days.
Smith was initially anxious to avoid upheaval but in 1992 he attended the
10-week Advanced Management Programme at the Harvard Business School. One of
the lessons he says he learned was the importance of radical change. 'You
don't create a winning business by nibbling away at the sides,' he says.
'That just leaves you with frayed edges.'
In 1993, he commissioned a study focused on the 2,700 white-collar staff. It
recommended that about one-third of them should go, and that the
hierarchical command-and-control style management should be eradicated in
favour of a flat structure based on coaching and empowerment.
Smith also canvassed his staff for their views on the company's management
style in an employee opinion survey.
The survey results were pretty bruising, he recalls. 'What came across was
an organisation based on bureaucracy, poor internal communications and too
much fear.'
Smith, who had long campaigned for a more open style of management, held a
series of employee presentations on the results of the opinion survey. It
was an embarrassing experience being openly criticised on subjects such as
his Pounds 163,000 salary, but he believes that attending the presentations
was a turning point for many employees. 'Until that moment many of them did
not believe the changes we had been talking about would happen.'
In getting rid of the 900 staff, Smith's main problem was to ensure that the
right people stayed. So instead of keeping only those staff whose jobs
remained, he decided all employees would have to re-apply for positions
under the new order. Part of their appraisal would be an occupational
personality questionnaire, designed to look for abilities that would be
needed by the new AW: conceptual thinking; innovation; team-working;
initiative; people-orientation; and flexibility.
The questionnaire became a focus of resentment among some staff who felt
they had been unfairly deprived of jobs. Some psychologists have also shed
doubts on the validity of the technique, arguing that what people say in
questionnaires may not bear much relationship to how they do their jobs. But
Smith, who also filled in a questionnaire, insists they are valuable as an
indicator of how somebody might be able to adapt to a new culture,
especially managers.
'If you want a brave new world, spending half an hour discussing what
someone has done for the past 10 years doesn't get you far ahead.' In any
case, the questionnaires were only part of the appraisal process, he says.
Another lesson he learned at Harvard was the role of Total Quality
Management. 'I knew it was important before I went, but I came away
understanding that it meant far more than I had realised.' One way that
Smith put this theory into practice was by upgrading the status of staff
working on water mains and sewers.
'They're our front-line people and if they were not properly
customer-focused all our efforts behind the scenes would fall apart.' Hence
his decision to bring all these staff into a customer services unit. By
October, all the appointments had been made, while at the same time the
number of management tiers between any individual and the top had been
reduced to three. Smith expects the changes to yield annual savings of
Pounds 20m within the next two years.
One of the main outstanding tasks is to select a computer system capable of
handling the streamlined flow of data across and up the organisation, in
addition to the downwards route.
'You don't do anything big without computers,' says Smith. 'That was the
third lesson I learnt at Harvard.' Part of the Pounds 60m provision will
help pay for new information technology systems.
Although most consumers feel they do not have a choice of water supplier
Smith says competition is real. He is keenly aware of Severn Trent Water and
Yorkshire Water pressing on his borders and of the possibility of smaller
independent operators moving in to siphon off the most lucrative parts of
the business.
Meanwhile, staff will have to be constantly vigilant to ensure they do not
slip back into their bad habits, he warns.
Cultural changes do not happen overnight, and many companies that embark on
ambitious programmes abandon them half-way through. 'But I'm conscious of
the long, hard road we've embarked on and am absolutely determined not to
give up.'
An article on psychometric tests will appear on Monday's management page.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Management: Ford's global matrix gamble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In just over a fortnight's time, on New Year's Day, one of the boldest
organisational experiments of the decade will kick into action. After a
remarkably - some would say dangerously - short preparation period of only
10 months, the Ford Motor Company will merge its North American and European
operations into a single 'global' structure.
In place of its long-standing twin organisations on each side of the
Atlantic, which suffered from overlap, waste, poor communication and
inadequate exchange of know-how, it is creating five transatlantic 'vehicle
centres', each with responsibility for particular sizes and types of
vehicle. Four of them will be located in the US, but the one with the
greatest growth potential, for small- and medium-sized cars, will be based
jointly in Britain and Germany.
The centres will have responsibility not only for designing, developing and
launching their respective lines of vehicles for North America and Europe,
but also for the profitability and cash flow of each product throughout its
life. Their development responsibilities will also cover Asia, although
Ford's Asia Pacific and Latin American operations will remain officially
separate from the new structure for now.
The group's transformation, christened 'Ford 2000', has rightly attracted
widespread attention on a series of counts:
For its speed: most multinationals in other industries have taken a decade
to shift their organisations gradually from national or regional structures
to near-global ones.
For the degree of 'process re-engineering' involved: a key part of Ford's
transformation is the introduction of a single set of worldwide processes
and systems in product development, production, supply and sales.
For the sharp 'delayering' which is occurring in several parts of the
organisation, halving Ford's average number of levels from 14 to seven.
And for the degree of behavioural and cultural change involved in what is,
in effect, an overdue bid by Ford's new chairman, Alex Trotman, to drag the
company into the late 20th century by removing its outdated military
mentality.
More than most other multinationals outside the Germanic world, Ford has
suffered for too long from a 'command and control' culture which has
fostered the power of departmental barons at the expense of innovation,
speedy decision-making and cross-functional teamwork.
But one key facet of the transformation has received surprisingly little
comment, given its inherently controversial and risky nature: that the new
structure consists of a matrix in which most managers - an estimated 10,000
of them - will find their lives complicated in the new year by having more
than one boss.
Most will report to a manager from one of the new vehicle centres. But they
will also report to an executive from one of the 'functional' departments
(manufacturing, marketing/sales, purchasing etc.)
In many ways, the introduction of this matrix is Ford's most fundamental
change. It is certainly the one being trumpeted most noisily within the
company as vital to global teamwork and organisational effectiveness.
Ford's internal videos and other forms of employee communications have waxed
lyrical over the past few months about the virtues of matrix management.
They claim it provides 'a flexible environment where all avenues are open,
there are no one-way streets and no dead ends'.
In similarly colourful vein, Trotman has declared repeatedly that, compared
with Ford's established, pyramid-like organisation, matrix management will
be 'more like jazz than a structured orchestra'. It will, he promises, allow
considerable informality, and improvisation as situations change.
Trotman's metaphor is striking. But it ignores the fact that, while some
jazz combos do achieve the 'perfect harmony' which Ford says it wants to
create, others produce only cacophony and chaos.
This was certainly the painful outcome of most of the matrix management
practised widely in the 1960s and 1970s, especially by American
multinationals.
With a few notable exceptions, their matrices were plagued by internal
conflict, inefficiency, expense and delay, as divisional, geographic and
functional managers debated and fought with each other. In many cases
disputes were only resolved laboriously by powerful co-ordinators acting as
matrix 'police'.
Ford hopes to rehabilitate matrix management by several means, both 'hard'
and 'soft'. They include: making doubly sure that objectives are agreed
precisely between the vehicle centres and the functional side of the
organisation; specifying clearly the respective roles and responsibilities
of individuals towards each side of the matrix; changing appraisal and
reward systems accordingly; only appointing senior executives who have shown
they can work collaboratively; training everyone involved in the art of
developing a co-operative matrix 'mindset' which largely replaces the need
for policing; and introducing much more intensive and open communication
than the organisation is used to.
Enthusiasm for the new way of working is palpable within the company, not
merely at the top. There is particular excitement about the visibility of
the new vehicle centres, and the global future which they promise.
Yet to an outsider, the organisation has too much of the shape and feel of
what business school academics call a 'balanced matrix', in which the power
of its two sides are too even for them to operate smoothly together. If this
proves to be the case, Trotman will have to do some tricky retuning. That
could prove almost as controversial as the current upheaval.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Councils Shake-up: Target date for most now 1997 - Timing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most of the new councils in England will now start in April 1997, as the
parliamentary timetable looks too tight for all the necessary orders to be
passed in time for the original target of April 1996.
Orders for Cleveland and the Isle of Wight will be debated in parliament
next month. Officials hope that orders for reorganising Avon and Humberside
can also be introduced.
For councils reorganising in 1996, 'shadow councils' must be elected in May
next year to oversee the establishment of the new authority. The shadow
councillors will decide on staffing and accommodation before taking over as
the first elected council.
However, preparations for shadow elections cannot start until orders making
the reorganisation law have been passed by both houses of parliament. In the
case of yesterday's recommendations, Mr Gummer must wait for six weeks after
he has received a proposal from the commission before laying a parliamentary
order, to allow for further consultations.
The shadow authorities will need to take important decisions, and there is
fierce political opposition to any attempt at establishing a new authority
without a formally elected group of councillors.
Personnel decisions will cause the greatest problems. There is contrasting
legal advice over whether all employees of out-going authorities are
guaranteed new jobs with their successors under the Transfer of Undertakings
(Protection of Employment) regulations of 1981, known as Tupe. Unions are
sure to back any redundant employees who claim that Tupe does apply, which
could create years of legal wrangling.
Personnel, plus investment in new information technology systems and, in
some cases, new town halls, will make transition very expensive. Costs could
be greatest in counties where new unitaries and two-tier authorities will
exist side by side. In these cases the commission estimates that there is no
potential for annual savings. Such arrangements will not lead to any cuts in
staff numbers and cannot make any long-term savings, but they will still
cost money to establish.
The Audit Commission predicts that these arrangements will create the
greatest management problems. The counties will have little incentive to
help the unitary city appearing in their midst, and there could be
competition for staff. Government funding, based on needs and current
spending, will also present problems because counties will have an incentive
to understate the amount spent on the new cities.
As cities tend to be more needy than the rural areas around them, the 'rump'
counties will probably have to budget for substantially less government
grant per head of population than they have now. In areas with a solely
unitary structure the costs will still be high. Replacing the relatively
small county of Buckinghamshire with four unitaries, for example, would cost
between Pounds 10m and Pounds 13m.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Councils Shake-up: Mixed views on single-tier structure -
Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Scotland, a uniform single-tier local government structure comes into
effect on April 1 1996, following the passage last month of the Scottish
Local Government Reform Act. Elections for the shadow authorities take place
this April.
There will be 28 single-tier councils in mainland Scotland, replacing the
nine regional and 53 district councils. The three single-tier island
councils will be unchanged.
There was no equivalent in Scotland of Sir John Banham's Local Government
Commission to test local opinion. Instead people were asked about government
white paper proposals for the new councils and the water industry.
Opposition parties had envisaged local government being reorganised only
after the establishment of a Scottish parliament or independent state. But
the government could claim that it has simply implemented commitments
contained in the 1992 general election manifestos of the Labour, Liberal
Democrat and Scottish National parties - as well as its own.
Although all Scottish local authorities are now co-operating with the
Scottish Office over reform, there are widespread misgivings about the loss
of the strategic role played by the nine regional councils. For instance,
Strathclyde Regional Council - centred on Glasgow - is being broken into 12
authorities. Yet where an existing district council will become a unitary
authority, local government staff are showing enthusiasm for the extended
powers.
The government is taking water and sewerage out of local authority control
to set up three state-owned water authorities, involving the private sector
in upgrading facilities.
The Scottish Office intends to hand management of motorways and main dual
carriageways to private companies, which may be asked to co-ordinate the
management of other trunk roads.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Councils Shake-up: Doubt over cost of reorganisation
'gamble' - The new structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's new local government structure was yesterday described by Sir John
Banham, its architect, as a 'gamble' which is also 'a very attractive
investment in anyone's language'.
If this sounds incoherent, it at least reflects the new local government map
which has emerged from two years of consultations by the Local Government
Commission. Plans for 18 counties were announced yesterday, involving total
abolition for only two - Berkshire and Dorset. Sir John estimated the total
cost of implementing yesterday's plans at about Pounds 75m, while plans now
abandoned for creating unitaries would have cost five times that figure.
The commission is unsure whether the 20 proposed new authorities will save
money or create extra costs. It estimated that annual costs could rise by as
much as Pounds 35m or fall by as much as Pounds 10m.
Sir John said the moves were a gamble because there was no evidence that
unitary authorities could improve provision for services such as community
care or education. However, he thought it was an excellent investment
because 'if the new authorities manage to improve their efficiency by only 1
per cent they will pay for the transition costs within nine months'.
Plans for the remaining five English counties - Cornwall, Derbyshire,
Gloucestershire, Hertfordshire and Shropshire - will be announced next
month, but they have already been widely leaked, and the expected
conclusions are shown in the map.
In spite of the government's original intention to create a new single tier
of local authorities - to combine the powers of district and county councils
and improve accountability - only eight counties will be completely replaced
by all-purpose unitary authorities. A total of 45 unitaries will be created,
while 230 districts will remain as part of a two-tier structure, and 31
upper-tier county councils will survive in some form.
Common themes include the unpicking of the work of the last reorganisation
in 1974. Avon, Cleveland and Humberside, all created 20 years ago, are to be
abolished and replaced by smaller unitaries, while Herefordshire and
Rutland, both abandoned in 1974, are to be reinstated.
But this pattern is not universal. Cumbria, a creation of 1974, remains
intact, while Huntingdonshire, subsumed into Cambridgeshire at the same
time, has failed to regain its independent status.
Eight urban areas were yesterday recommended for self-governing unitary
status they lost in 1974 - Brighton and Hove, Leicester, Nottingham,
Plymouth, Southend, Stoke-on-Trent, Swindon, and Torbay - while the counties
surrounding them kept the two-tier structure.
Sir John quoted from the report made by the Redcliffe-Maud commission, whose
advice was overturned in the 1974 reorganisation. This had said that unitary
county boroughs represented local government at its best and 'most
accountable'.
In spite of this praise the Former County Boroughs Group, a council lobbying
body, attacked Sir John on an 'arbitrary U-turn' on unitary status for
several other former county boroughs and said the government should reject
the proposals outright.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Councils Shake-up: Public 'juries' overturned verdict - The
move to let local people decide their own future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Local Government Commission was the child of the poll tax. But unlike
its parent, the commission will not lead to universal upheaval in England's
local government system following yesterday's announcement.
For most of the past three years such upheaval has been on the cards. When
in March 1991 Mr Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary, announced
the abolition of the poll tax and the establishment of a commission to
review England's local authority structure, there was an air of
inevitability about a wholesale move towards single-tier authorities in
place of the two-tier structure of county and district councils prevalent in
most of non-metropolitan Britain.
On the same day it was announced that unitary authorities would almost
certainly replace the two-tier structure in Scotland and Wales - without
recourse to an interim commission.
Senior ministers were known to favour the same outcome for England. It had
already been imposed on London, with the abolition of the Greater London
Council. Broad support for a single-tier structure was also forthcoming from
the opposition Labour and Liberal Democrat parties, and from district
councils, which outnumbered their county cousins - in lobbying power as well
as numbers - by seven to one.
Until this autumn, the commission appeared to be following this pre-ordained
route. Its draft recommendations, most of them published last June, were
largely for unitary authorities as a 'preferred option', heralding the
elimination of county councils.
The explanation for why the apparently inevitable did not happen lies in an
unexpected decision taken by Sir John Banham, the commission's chairman,
early this year.
Sir John took a step quite alien to policy formulation in Britain: he
decided to undertake formal public consultation, holding a postal referendum
in counties where his proposals were most contentious. All households in 33
counties were mailed, with voters invited to give their views to the
commission on the proposed structural changes and alternatives to them.
Had such a step been taken with the poll tax, it would certainly have
failed; so too, in all likelihood, would the move to unitary authorities in
Scotland, which is now an accomplished fact.
The biggest winner in the public consultation was apathy. In only one county
was the response rate higher than 10 per cent of the adult population, a
fair indication that radical change did not enjoy popular support.
However, of the minority who took part in the referenda, in all but a
handful of counties most favoured a continuation of a two-tier structure
although in some cases - such as Devon, Essex, Northamptonshire and
Wiltshire - unitary statusfor a part of the county was supported.
In the last recommendations, the counties recommended for abolition are
those - Dorset, Berks, Beds and Bucks - where the status quo was
emphatically defeated in the referendums.
The decision to consult the people appears to have been taken by Sir John
personally. He received no encouragement from ministers or officials, few of
whom relished the unpredictability of the exercise. But, as Sir John put it
to one audience, the voters were to be the 'jury'.
The fact that the voters largely repudiated his initial recommendations to
abolish 27 county councils left Sir John unfazed. After withdrawing plans to
abolish six counties last month, he said: 'If we had pressed ahead with our
recommendations without listening to local people we would be recommending
transitional costs of the order of Pounds 135m.'
Last month he told the Association of County Councils that unitary
authorities were a 'gamble'. He added: 'People are not willing to support an
expensive gamble on the say-so of local politicians with a vested interest,
and they have not been impressed by many campaigns - at public expense -
designed to persuade them otherwise.' Once controversy over the changes - or
lack of them - has died down, the Local Government Commission's most
enduring legacy may be its novel experiment with postal referenda. The
outcome showed policymakers to be fundamentally out of touch with the people
 -but did so in a way that allowed the policy to be changed before damage
was done.
If so, it will be a final throw-back to the poll tax. Before resorting to
that measure, Mrs Thatcher and Mr Heseltine - then in his first stint as
environment secretary - toyed seriously with the idea of forcing councils to
hold local referenda if they wanted to exceed government spending targets.
They dropped the idea because of opposition from Conservative MPs and
councillors.

In Dorset, the decision to replace the county council with four unitary
authorities has been made in the teeth of opposition from the local business
community, Roland Adburgham writes.
The commission acknowledged that the 'overwhelming preference' of business
people was to have one authority for the Bournemouth conurbation - which
includes Poole and Christchurch - and another for rural Dorset. Instead, it
proposes the conurbation be split into three councils.
The commission did not put forward the two-council option for public
consultation. It argued that a single authority for the urban area would not
take sufficient account of community identities and interests.
Mr Stephen Hall, president of Dorset Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, said
yesterday: 'We are deeply disappointed and will make what representations we
can to the secretary of state. The local political issues have been decisive
and the voice of industry has been ignored.'
The commission said 37 per cent of the 42,000 people who made
representations favoured four councils.

<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Wales, where the principle of unitary authorities is broadly supported,
reorganisation of local government has been less contentious than in
England.
The Local Government (Wales) Bill to create 22 single-tier councils became
law in July. Shadow elections will be held next May to the new authorities,
which replace eight county and 37 district councils.
The new councils will take over in April 1996. Cardiff, which is at present
run by the city council and South Glamorgan County Council, will gain
unitary status.
Transition committees have been set up for each of the 22 councils to
facilitate the mergers. Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, announced on
Thursday that to meet the reorganisation costs, councils will receive Pounds
43m. Few redundancies are envisaged among the 150,000 full and part-time
workers employed by local government in Wales.
Labour and Plaid Cymru, the nationalist party, unsuccessfully pressed the
case for an elected Welsh assembly as a strategic overlord for the new
structure and a counterweight to the powers of the Welsh secretary and
quangos. But detailed opposition to the bill mostly concerned boundaries and
the proposal by Mr Redwood to allow area committees, with some delegated
powers, in geographically large areas such as Powys. Opponents regard these
as likely to create confusion.
The shadow authorities have to produce service delivery plans by next autumn
and Mr Redwood retains powers to order joint arrangements between
neighbouring councils if he believes that necessary.
Unlike in England, no commission set out to canvass local views. Instead,
there was a white paper which originally proposed 21 councils.

Sir John Banham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir John Banham, who headed the local government review for England, proudly
describes himself as a 'difficult man to direct'.
Successive environment ministers seem to agree with him. Mr Robert Jones,
the local government minister and former chairman of the Commons environment
committee, described Sir John's performance as 'an extraordinary mixture of
self-contradiction, confusion and flippancy'.
He added that many people hoped 'the next tumbril rolling down Whitehall'
would have Sir John inside it.
There has indeed been much self-contradiction and flippancy in Sir John's
language during the past two years as he has guided the Local Government
Commission around England. But they have masked the workings of a canny
political operator who appears to have forced ministers to accept a local
government structure very different from the one they envisaged.
The principles Sir John has applied can be seen in his earlier career. As
first chairman of the Audit Commission, the watchdog body for local
government finance set up by Mr Michael Heseltine in his first spell as
environment secretary, he showed a rigid determination to limit costs.
Then he was director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, with
members that strongly opposed small, fragmented authorities. Large companies
wanted to deal with as few regulation and enforcement officials as possible
and did not want to pay for an expensive reorganisation. That led them to
call either for large unitary authorities, or for the status quo - the
predominant pattern of Sir John's first recommendations last year.
After opposition from district councils forced Mr John Gummer, the
environment secretary, to change his guidance to the commission in September
last year, Sir John's comments were trenchant. He said Mr Gummer's ruling
that the new government structures could be more expensive than those they
replaced was 'absolutely astonishing', and estimated the total cost at
Pounds 1bn.
He followed that with a letter to Mr Gummer saying that backbench
Conservative MPs wanted no change to the system, and a complaint to Mr
Jones's committee that the commission could not finish its work 'unless we
get Whitehall off our backs'.
When it came to reversing the commission's original proposals, Sir John
insisted that they had merely been 'options', and then held expensive
consultations which were not required by legislation. Sir John referred to
these as advisory 'referenda', even after commission staff had objected
strongly to the use of the word.
Once he had obtained the results he expected from the referenda, he knew the
government would find it difficult or impossible to overturn his final
recommendations.
And the man appointed to engineer a radical reform of local government added
a dose of cynicism. 'Any reorganisation costs more and delivers less than
its proponents suggest,' he said. Not an easy man to manage.

Republican leaders yesterday took pre-emptive aim at President Bill
Clinton's proposals for a middle class tax cut, dismissing them as
inadequate even before they had been made. Mr Clinton last night sought to
revive his political popularity in a televised speech which included
proposals for tax cuts of about Dollars 60bn (Pounds 38.4bn) over five
years.
Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican who has already announced his
intention to challenge Mr Clinton for the presidency in 1996, said yesterday
that the president was 'more than a day late and more than a dollar short'.
Mr Gramm said that the lower limit for a tax cut was the figure of Dollars
107bn promised in the contract with America manifesto, on which most
Republicans in the House of Representatives campaigned in the November
elections.
'I am not going to support a tax cut for families that short-changes them,
and the president's proposal is going to be a non-starter unless it at least
meets the level that has been set by the House of Representatives,' Mr Gramm
said. Mr Haley Barbour, Republican National Committee chairman, said Mr
Clinton was trying to jump on the tax cut train after it had left the
station.
Mr Clinton's package would allow income tax credits for families with
children, but with a lower income ceiling than the Dollars 200,000 proposed
by some Republicans. One of the tax credits would be to help offset college
tuition fees.
In his search for ways to pay for tax cuts, Mr Clinton has lately examined a
range of options, some as radical as abolishing entire government
departments, such as Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or Transportation.
Republicans warned Mr Clinton, however, that in a poker game over who could
propose the biggest tax cut and the largest reduction in government, they
would outbid him.
'We will see him a tax cut and HUD, and raise him Education and Energy,'
said Mr Edwin Feulner, president of the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing
Washington think-tank.
But fiscal conservatives are alarmed at the tax cut bidding war now in
progress.
'Don't buy this pig in a poke. It may feel good in the short term, but it's
not going to feel good in the long term,' said Senator Bob Kerrey, a
Nebraska Democrat who chaired a bipartisan commission appointed to consider
long-term reforms to bring the government's finances into balance.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Cardoso on his mark for a reforming sprint: The Brazilian
president-elect is clear about his policy priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's Senate gave an effusive farewell on Wednesday to Mr Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, who is to become the country's next president on January
1. If he pursues the policies needed to modernise the Brazilian state, and
which are sure to be unpopular, it may be some time before he is invited
back.
Mr Cardoso used the occasion to make a wide-ranging speech listing the
priorities for his four-year term in office. Rather than grandiose visions,
he concentrated on reforms he needs to tackle during the first few months.
'Brazil is in a hurry. We have only a limited period to take the measures to
guarantee stability and prepare for a new cycle of development,' he said.
Mr Cardoso's haste is prompted by time bombs within the government budget
and social security system. Both threaten the success of the Real currency
which Mr Cardoso planned when he was finance minister. The currency reduced
monthly inflation from about 50 per cent before its July launch to 2-3 per
cent today and its success ensured Mr Cardoso's election victory.
The Real worked partly because the government has this year balanced its
budget, mainly by severe spending cuts. Next year, however, the government
is forecasting a deficit of Dollars 5bn-Dollars 10bn (Pounds 3.2bn-Pounds
6.4bn), equal to 1-2 per cent of GDP and enough to prompt worries about
inflation. Meanwhile, Brazil's badly designed social security system, which
will soon have more beneficiaries than contributors, is set to cost Dollars
28bn in 1995, against just Dollars 14.2bn three years ago.
In his speech Mr Cardoso highlighted three areas for reform, all requiring
constitutional changes. He said the central government's responsibilities,
and spending obligations, needed to be devolved to local government and the
private sector; government revenues needed to be raised by an overhaul of
the tax system; and the social security system had to be reformed to remove
anomalies and lax rules.
None of these ideas is new, and there is widespread agreement in Congress
and the business sector that reform, in general terms, is needed. The
problem, however, and the reason why change has not yet happened, is that
specific proposals proved unpopular and often threatened big losses for
powerful interest groups.
Mr Cardoso, a cautious man who likes to build consensus before acting, took
care in his Senate speech not to mention any unpopular measures. Talking
about tax reform, he stressed the need to cut taxes on exports and basic
goods for poorer families. He did not dwell on his probable need to lift the
overall tax burden from 25 per cent of GDP, which is low by international
standards.
He said he would send specific ideas on constitutional reform to Congress in
February. Any changes would need three fifths approval; Mr Cardoso so far
looks capable of mustering the support.
His Social Democracy party (PSDB) and its allies have just under half the
seats in Congress, and earlier this week he won the backing of the
Democratic Movement (PMDB), Brazil's biggest political party. But until Mr
Cardoso takes office and spells out his plans, it is difficult to assess the
loyalty of his allies.
'He will have two to three months' honeymoon, then it will get difficult,'
Mr Luiz Pedone of the University of Braslia predicts. 'There will be strong
opposition, including from some of the government's backers, on
controversial reforms like reducing the central government's spending
obligations and the size of the public sector.'
The reforms Mr Cardoso is seeking will take time to affect significantly the
government's budget and will not start reducing its spending obligations
until 1996 at the earliest. Next year's deficit will probably have to be
covered by privatisation receipts.
Mr Cardoso said Brazil's privatisation programme, which has lagged behind
those of neighbours such as Argentina, needed to be 'accelerated and
extended' to energy, transport, telecoms and mining.
Departing from his prepared text, he spoke of how impressed he was by US
telecommunications technology on a recent visit to Miami. Brazil's telecoms'
monopoly - which has suffered from a lack of competition and government
under-investment - needed to be made more 'flexible' or be left behind, he
said.
These signals, which will be welcomed by foreign companies eyeing Brazil's
telecoms market, suggest Mr Cardoso's cautious conversion to privatisation
is continuing. However, he stressed the state need not lose control of its
monopoly, and he did not mention the state-owned oil monopoly Petrobras.
Persuading Congress to back speedier privatisation will also be difficult.
State-owned companies are still seen by many politicians as sources of
patronage.
A member of the outgoing government said Mr Cardoso's popularity when he
took office would give him clout to make many of the changes he needed, but
only if inflation stayed below 2-3 per cent a month and people continued to
feel better off.
'The first half of next year will be crucial for approving these reforms.
The danger is the new government will spend too long trying to reach
compromise solutions with interest groups which stand to lose out, and the
door will close.'

FT  16 DEC 94 / Strike impasse dashes hopes for a new start to baseball
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Negotiations to resolve the baseball players' strike that cut last season
short have broken down, greatly reducing the chances that the sport will
start again next spring in anything approximating its current major league
form.
Owners of the 28 teams, meeting in Chicago late yesterday, were expected to
declare an impasse in the talks, a legal device under labour relations law
that would enable them unilaterally to impose a cap on player salaries.
The players' union is likely to counter with a lawsuit accusing management
of failing to bargain in good faith. This would lead to an investigation by
the National Labour Relations Board, the independent federal agency, which
could last two months.
The NLRB has already sided with the players on a related issue by announcing
that it has filed a complaint that the owners improperly withheld Dollars
7.8m (Pounds 5m) in contributions to the players' pension fund due on August
1, less than two weeks before the strike started.
Last week the department of Labour certified the dispute as official, thus
clearing the way for the union to petition the government not to grant visas
to non-American players, mostly from Latin America, whom the owners have
threatened to import as substitutes, along with minor league players, in an
attempt to get some kind of season under way next year.
There had been some hope earlier this week that the latest round of
negotiations was making progress on alternatives to a pure salary cap as the
best means of sharing revenues more equitably between rich and poor clubs.
Modified proposals by the owners on taxing team payrolls had not been
dismissed out of hand by the players, but no agreement proved possible.
With spring training due to start in 10 weeks, there has been no break in
player solidarity, though public opinion now tends to blame them more than
the owners for the problems of the country's national sport. Some owners
have expressed misgivings about sacrificing another season, but the majority
seem determined to let the confrontation run its course.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Mexico raises privatisation revenue targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico is to embark on an ambitious new privatisation and foreign borrowing
programme designed to raise Dollars 5.5bn (3.5bn) in 1995, according to Mr
Jaime Serra Puche, the new finance minister.
The funds will be used to stimulate infrastructure investment and help
finance the country's large current account deficit.
Mr Serra said in an interview this week immediate candidates for
privatisation are the high-volume Mexico City-Queretaro and Mexico
City-Puebla toll roads and the country's ports. Significant revenues will
also come from the fees charged to new entrants in the long-distance
telephone service market when the former state-owned telephone company
Telmex is stripped of its monopoly status in January of 1997.
Although Mr Serra stopped short of designating the country's rail system and
secondary petrochemical plants among other state-owned industries to be sold
off, these sectors are expected to be included in the new privatisation
list. This would allow the Mexican government to reach its stated revenue
target without being forced to achieve the Dollars 5bn foreign borrowing
limit it has set for itself in 1995.
Privatisation of the railways would almost certainly require a
constitutional amendment, while the regulatory framework for petrochemical
privatisation already exists.
Funds raised from privatisation and other one-time revenues, together with
foreign borrowing by government entities, will be used to provide financing
guarantees and/or risk capital for private infrastructure projects. Export
promotion programs would also be targeted with these new revenues in an
attempt to reduce Mexico's trade deficit, which in the first nine months of
1994 grew by 31.9 per cent over the same period last year.
Mr Serra also acknowledged that privatisation and other structural reforms
had additional motives. He said the moves willsignal that Mexico was going
forward with the sort of reforms that would strengthen the confidence of
foreign investors in the country and lead to more capital inflows.
Most analysts consider securing sufficient foreign capital to be Mexico's
biggest macroeconomic challenge in the coming year. The government is
forecasting a current account deficit of 7.8 per cent of GDP, or
approximately Dollars 30.5bn, a slight increase over 1994's estimate of 7.6
per cent and Dollars 29bn respectively. This year capital inflows fell short
by some Dollars 7bn, causing a corresponding drop in international reserves,
which now stand in the neighbourhood of Dollars 17bn.
Mr Serra rejected a similar fall in reserves during 1995, arguing that if
capital inflows were to slow down so would the economy and imports. At the
same time, however, he did acknowledge that this was a long-run relationship
and there could be a short-term gap between the supply of foreign capital
and demand for foreign goods, as happened in 1994.
'The reserves exist to cover this gap,' said Mr Serra, rejecting time and
time again in the interview that the way to soften a possible shortfall in
the capital account was via a devaluation in the peso.
Were such a gap to repeat itself in 1995, Mr Serra said that although 'we're
not going to mess with the markets,' he would rather see interest rates
raised before he would agree to a one-off devaluation of the peso or an
increase in the daily depreciation of the exchange rate band.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Turbo-prop safety fears put off the passengers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Short-hop flights on small commuter aircraft are big business in the US:
there are more than 12,500 a day. But many passengers dislike the
propellor-powered aircraft typically used on these flights - and may be even
less keen to use them after this week's fatal accident in North Carolina.
On Tuesday evening a turbo-prop BAe Jetstream Super 31 on an American Eagle
commuter flight crashed into a wood on its final approach into
Raleigh-Durham International Airport, killing 15 of the 20 passengers. The
cause is not yet known.
The accident came less than two months after another American Eagle
turbo-prop, an ATR-72, went down while waiting to land at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport, killing all 68 on board. Ice on the wings is the
suspected cause.
The accidents themselves would have been enough to make some passengers
jittery about flying by turbo-prop aircraft. But last month, they were given
another reason to feel nervous when the International Airline Passengers
Association, a Washington-based consumer organisation, said people should
fly by propellor-driven aircraft only in good weather during daylight hours
to minimise the chance of accidents.
Further anxiety was caused last weekend when the Federal Aviation
Administration banned the ATR-72 and ATR-42 turbo-prop aircraft from flying
in icy conditions, causing widespread flight cancellations in the
north-eastern US.
Turbo-prop aircraft are disliked by many passengers because they tend to be
slower, noisier and more cramped than jets. But their use is growing in the
US because they provide the most economical means of picking up small
numbers of passengers from local communities and feeding them into
longer-distance flights at regional hubs.
As big airlines face increasing competition from low-cost carriers, they are
replacing jets with turbo-props on some routes. Earlier this year, for
example, American Airlines replaced all its jet services in Cincinnati with
turbo-prop flights.
To some extent, the safety fears associated with turbo-prop aircraft are
justified. Statistics show that, on US domestic flights, regional airlines
suffered 0.11 fatal accidents per 100,000 flights last year - more than
three times the rate of 0.029 suffered by the big carriers.
Some of the reasons cited for the difference include less rigorous training
standards for pilots of small aircraft, less sophisticated avionics gear,
less effective de-icing gear, and vulnerability to bad weather because small
aircraft tend to fly at lower altitudes.
However, the Regional Airline Association, a US industry body, says the
safety fears are overdone. Excluding Alaska, where operating conditions are
particularly difficult, it says that the accident rate for regional airlines
falls to 0.037 fatal accidents per 100,000 flights - not that much higher
than the figure for big carriers.
Still, Ms Deborah McElroy, the association's vice president, says it would
be naive to believe that the safety concerns are not having some effect on
passenger numbers. 'You read in the papers that some people are driving
rather than taking a turbo-prop aircraft, which is ironic since it's nearly
100 times safer to use a regional airline than it is to make the same trip
by car.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela's banking crisis this week claimed another victim, as the
government took over the Grupo Latinoamericano, a conglomerate of 43
financial and other companies, because of troubles at the two banks it
owned.
The two banks in the group controlled by Mr Orlando Castro - Republica and
Progreso - will continue operating. They were taken over following the
failure to service loans made earlier this year by government agencies in an
attempt to prop up the bank and, more recently, settlement difficulties. The
group 'had a liquidity problem and a solvency problem,' according to Finance
Minister Julio Sosa.
The takeover means the state now owns about 70 per cent of the banking
system, following a crisis which erupted at the start of the year.
Ironically, the first bank to go under - Banco Latino - reopened its doors
this week, as did its Edge Act subsidiary in Miami.
Mr Sosa said in an interview that he believed the crisis was drawing to a
close. 'I think we are more or less getting to the end of it. People now
realise that their deposits are OK.' Government policy now is to keep the
banks operating.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Nigeria under pressure to scrap economic controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS and MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A team from the International Monetary Fund has completed talks this week in
Abuja with Nigeria's finance ministry less than three weeks before the
military regime is due to review economic policy in the 1995 budget.
General Sani Abacha, head of state, is under pressure from investors and
official creditors to scrap the economic controls imposed in January and
deal with the Dollars 8bn arrears in debt service to the Paris Club.
Since early 1992 Nigeria has not serviced its debt to the Paris Club, which
accounts for more than half its Dollars 28bn external debt. Nigeria needs
some form of agreement with the IMF and a few months' good track record to
gain external debt relief and unlock international finance for planned gas
export projects.
The fund is looking for significant steps to deregulate foreign exchange and
interest rate policy, cut the budget deficit and account for all oil
revenue. There is also continued concern about the estimated 150,000 barrels
a day of oil revenue that goes into offshore dedication accounts under the
supervision of the presidency and which never enters the government's books.
The Nigerian government is being urged to curb uneconomic capital projects
and recurrent spending and to find more revenue.
Although the government forecast a balanced budget in 1994, economists
believe the budget deficit this year will be more than Dollars 4bn, which is
nearly 100 per cent of forecast expenditure and about 14 per cent of gross
domestic product, despite the failure to meet commitments to supply foreign
exchange to industry and the underfunding of joint ventures in oil
production.
There have been conflicting signals about the government's intentions,
particularly over the most contentious issue - foreign exchange policy. Some
finance ministry officials and the Central Bank of Nigeria argue for
deregulation. But Mr Aminu Saleh, a leading figure in the government,
recently ruled out deregulation.
Michael Holman, Africa Editor, adds: In an unprecedented attempt to crack
down on the country's black market in foreign currency and reinforce its
controversial exchange rate policy, Nigeria's military government has made
it an offence to disclose the street value of the naira.
In a decree issued last week, the authorities warned that to 'publish or
cause to be published exchange rates and interest rates other than that
approved by the Central Bank' would be an offence.
The penalty for individuals breaching the decree is a fine of N100,000
(Pounds 2,900 or Dollars 4,500) or two years' imprisonment, or both.
In January the government pegged the foreign exchange rate at N22 to the
dollar and closed the secondary or parallel market which allowed investors
to bring in and change dollars at the open market rate, which was between
N45 and N50 earlier this year.
The government also capped bank lending rates at 21 per cent. Privately the
government admits the measures have failed, with inflation rising to over
100 per cent on an annual basis, and the market rate of the Naira plunging
from N50 to N100 between June and November this year as receipts from the
country's exports failed to keep up with the demand for foreign currency.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Shift from protest to power tests ANC: Party confronts
challenges its founders would have been pleased to face
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the official launch of his autobiography in Johannesburg last week, South
African President Nelson Mandela joked that such were the rigours of his
office that he sometimes longed for the relative calm of prison.
As his African National Congress gathers tomorrow in the Afrikaner city of
Bloemfontein for its first national conference since winning the April
election, it is a sentiment that will be appreciated by the 3,000 delegates
 -the transformation from liberation movement to government is proving much
more demanding, and the social and economic fruits of political victory far
more elusive, than expected.
Nevertheless, it is a task which Mr Mandela and his party are undertaking
with vigour as they celebrate the fulfilment a dream first articulated in
1912, in the same conservative town, when a small group of black men
gathered to form an organisation that would fight their disenfranchisement
in the newly established country of South Africa.
Eighty-three years after its foundation, having weathered decades of the
imprisonment, torture, exile and murder of its members at the hands of the
white government, the ANC will be hoping to emerge from its first
post-apartheid conference with a united front and shared vision for the new
era.
Although Mr Mandela's popularity among blacks remains at levels other heads
of government can only dream of, and is growing steadily among other race
groups, the ANC as a party is losing ground.
Paid-up membership has fallen off sharply since April, contributing to a
budget crunch that has forced the retrenchment of a large number of party
officers.
More seriously, while black expectations were never as unrealistic as whites
feared, the government's failure to begin implementing its much-vaunted jobs
and housing programmes has led to an upsurge in grassroots dissatisfaction -
with the result that opinion polls show the ANC's national support has
dropped from 60.6 per cent in April to 53.6 per cent in September.
Part of the problem is that members of the new national and regional
parliaments are finding that their experiences in the protest movement are
of limited use when trying to draft and implement legislation. As Mr Tokyo
Sexwale, premier of the Gauteng region, the country's most powerful
province, asked rhetorically last month: 'Are we in power or just in
office?'
The primary theme of the conference - 'From Resistance to Reconstruction and
Nation Building' - reflects this concern. It is a theme which acknowledges
the ANC's inability as yet to manage the transition to efficient
administration. It is also, however, a theme designed to appeal to the
party's core black constituency to try to offset disillusionment with what
some ANC members describe as the government's overly reconciliatory attitude
to whites.
In an official position paper for the conference, drafted last month, Mr
Thabo Mbeki, deputy president, called on the ANC to refocus its attention on
its mass base - 'the black working class, black rural poor and the
significant section of the black middle strata'. The government will be
hoping this Africanist rhetoric will be enough to defuse the radical
elements at the conference.
But there are other problems to be overcome, particularly concerning the
party's relationship with its traditional allies. Although the ANC remains
in formal alliance with the country's largest labour federation,
Cosatu, as the government it is now reluctant to condone strikes and
inflationary wage demands that a year ago it would have supported.
Similarly, while the civic associations which sprang up in the 1980s as
opposition movements to imposed local government structures are still
formally aligned to the ANC, the two groupings have clashed publicly (and
sometimes violently) on the issue of continued rent and service boycotts in
the black townships.
The government, desperately wanting extra revenue to fund development
projects, is insisting that residents resume payments or face eviction, a
stand the associations are unwilling to endorse.
Politicking within the ANC over who should hold senior party posts is
complicating the situation. Mr Mbeki remains the front runner to be elected
deputy president of the party in place of the ailing Mr Walter Sisulu, but
the occasion will also be an important gauge of support for his chief rival,
Mr Cyril Ramaphosa.
After his defeat in the fight for the deputy presidency of South Africa, Mr
Ramaphosa, who is the party's incumbent secretary-general, has kept a low
profile.
In recent months there has been speculation he may withdraw from politics,
perhaps accepting a job in the private sector. However, in the past few
weeks most of the ANC's regional groupings have voiced support for Mr
Ramaphosa, who now seems likely to retain his position.
But whatever tribulations the ANC-led government is forced to address, one
thought will be uppermost in the mind of every one of the delegates gathered
in Bloemfontein - they are challenges that the party's founders would have
been only too pleased, and proud, to face.

Zimbabwe will move to full current account convertibility from January 1
with the liberalisation of dividend remittances and regulations covering
domestic borrowing by foreign - owned companies. The changes, announced by
Mr John Nkomo, acting finance minister, mean that foreign companies, which
invested in Zimbabwe before May 1, 1993, will be permitted to remit 100 per
cent of after-tax profits instead of 50 per cent as at present.
The relaxation applies only to dividends declared after January 1 and puts
all foreign-owned companies on the same footing. In the past, only companies
that invested since May 1993 were entitled to full dividend remittability.
Latest figures show Zimbabwe's net foreign asset position has improved from
minus Dollars 470m a year ago to a positive Dollars 3m. The country now has
foreign exchange reserves covering eight months imports.

in the developing world should fall by about 2.5m next year compared with
1990. The findings, in the latest review by the United Nations World
Children's Fund*, show that more than half the world's developing nations
are set to meet the ambitious targets put forward at the World Summit for
Children in 1990. The biggest advance has come in disorders involving iodine
deficiency, the world's single biggest cause of preventable mental
retardation. Almost 60 of the 94 affected countries are meeting the targets
to tackle iodine deficiency set in 1990, while a further 32 nations could do
so over the next 12 months. Substantial progress has been made in
eradicating polio, while deaths from measles, diarrhoea and pneumonia have
fallen abruptly.

The Japanese prime minister, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, will visit Washington
early next month for talks with President Bill Clinton, the government
announced yesterday. The visit will be Mr Murayama's first to the US since
he became prime minister last June. Bilateral trade relations, including the
unresolved issue of trade in cars and car components, are expected , once
again, to be the principal focus of the discussions. Mr Kozo Igarashi, chief
cabinet secretary, hinted that the timing of the trip, in the year that
marks the 50th anniversary of the end of the second world war, was as
important as its substance. Mr Murayama will be accompanied by the foreign
minister Mr Yohei Kono and the deputy chief cabinet secretary, Mr Hiroyuki

A former senior civil servant in Kenya has been charged with conspiring to
steal Ks5.76bn (Pounds 82m) from the central bank in a move timed to
reassure a donors' meeting in Paris of the government's commitment to stamp
out corruption. Mr Wilfred Koinange, the powerful permanent secretary at the
treasury until his retirement in May, is the most senior government official
to be charged in connection with a series of financial scandals which robbed
the Exchequer of over Ks30bn last year - the biggest embezzlement of public
funds in Kenya's history. Mr Koinange denied the prosecution charges and has
been remanded in custody until his bail application is heard next week.
The International Monetary Fund is understood to have warned President
Daniel arap Moi that it would not sign a new loan agreement unless his
government took firm steps to bring wrongdoers to justice. Without the IMF's
seal of approval, neither the World Bank nor bilateral donors would be
likely to pledge more aid at the Consultative Group meeting in Paris today.
Kenya is seeking up to Dollars 800m (Pounds 512m) in aid for 1995.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Row over rescues may dog Japan bank chief: Matsushita takes
over as governor of central bank tomorrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tomorrow Mr Yasuo Matsushita will take office as the new governor of the
Bank of Japan. He moves in to the central bank at a delicate time in
Japanese financial history.
Money market interest rates are rising, despite an anaemic economic recovery
and chronically weak demand for money. But his immediate concern will be the
fragility of the nation's banking system, and especially a growing political
furore over the bank's handling of it.
The problems began last week with an announcement by the outgoing governor,
Mr Yasushi Mieno, of a rescue package for two of the country's smaller
credit associations.
The scheme - a lifeboat to be launched in February for the two institutions
 -looked innocuous enough. Tokyo Kyowa and Anzen, like many of their larger
peers, waded far too deep into the waters of the bubble economy of the late
1980s.
They now have bad debts of more than Y100bn (Pounds 638m) and are virtually
insolvent. So the bank announced a rescue operation, funded partly by itself
 -with capital of Y20bn - and partly by private sector institutions, to take
over the troubled companies and dispose of the bad debts.
But this week the decision was publicly denounced by one cabinet minister,
and two others appear to have expressed concerns about it. Mr Ryutaro
Hashimoto, the minister for international trade and industry, said the move
was a dangerous precedent.
What has upset ministers is that the rescue breaks with past practice. Two
years ago the ministry of finance, principally responsible for banking
supervision, floated the idea of a publicly funded body to take over the bad
debts of the banking system, along the lines of the Resolution Trust
Corporation in the US savings and loans collapse. But there was immediate
hostility from the public, and the plan was quietly shelved. There is still
fierce opposition among the Japanese public to the idea that bankers should
be rescued from their own folly by the use of public funds.
When institutions have been in danger of collapse in the past , the bank and
the MoF have twisted the arms of larger companies and persuaded them to put
up the necessary funding for the rescue.
In Japan's intertwined financial world, most of the smaller institutions
have close links with larger, better-capitalised companies. Only two months
ago, Mitsubishi Bank was persuaded to take control of the ailing Nippon
Trust Bank, which had been brought near to collapse by the same bad lending
problems.
But in recent months, the larger banks have been telling the MoF they can no
longer justify the burden of rescuing ailing affiliates, without some
assistance from the authorities. Hence, analysts believe, last week's
unprecedented measure.
But this leaves a further puzzle. Just six weeks ago Mr Mieno, in what was
widely billed as one of the most significant speeches of his governorship,
signalled what many saw as a shift in Japanese financial policy. He stated
in unequivocal terms for the first time that banks and financial
institutions that got into trouble could not expect to be rescued.
'It is not the business of the central bank to save all financial
institutions from failure,' he said. Only where there was clear evidence of
'systemic risk' arising from the failure of an institution should the
authorities feel the need to act. 'Should a failure have the potential to
undermine stability as a whole, then that potential must be removed.'
These sentiments would not be unusual from the mouths of other central bank
governors who have tried to parry criticism that they are too soft on banks.
But in Japan, where the it represented a significant departure, and was
widely flagged as such by BoJ officials.
Yet it is difficult to argue that the failure of Tokyo Kyowa and Anzen, with
their combined deposit base of a mere Y243bn, represents any kind of
systemic risk to Japan's admittedly fragile banking system.
So why has the Bank, at the first opportunity to demonstrate its new,
tougher policy, retreated from it so spectacularly?
Some suspect that the plan represents the triumph of old MoF philosophy. The
MoF is much more instinctively sympathetic to the proposition that bank
collapses threaten financial stability.
The financial crises of the 1920s and 1930s were more severe in Japan than
elsewhere and there are many in the MoF who believe that any threat of a
repeat, however small, should be avoided.
Those suspicions are enhanced by the arrival of Mr Matsushita. Unlike his
predecessor, the new man is a former MoF official and is thought likely to
take a less independent line than Mr Mieno.
But this theory ignores the fact that the rescue was announced by Mr Mieno
before the end of his term.
A more likely explanation is that both Bank and the MoF are mindful of the
continuing difficulties faced not by the likes of Kyowa and Anzen, but by
the larger banks.
One senior banker suggested yesterday that the surprising move is intended
to test the waters of public opinion for a support operation that really
will be needed to ensure systemic stability if, as is possible, a leading
bank comes close to failing in the next year or so.
Although the total level of bad loans has probably peaked, banks' prospects
of eliminating the problem quickly are not assisted by declining
profitability and weak lending demand. The risk of a serious setback remains
strong.
In the meantime the political row will intensify in the period before the
lifeboat is formally launched - not the ideal start for Mr Matsushita's
tenure. But if the larger banks' health does deteriorate in the next year,
the new governor's position will get a lot more uncomfortable.

Preliminary money supply figures published by the Bank of Japan yesterday

writes Gerard Baker in Tokyo. The basic measure of the broad money stock
accelerated in November by 2.6 per cent on a year earlier, compared with an
annual growth rate of 2.4 per cent in October. On a monthly basis, the broad
money figure - M2 (cash in circulation plus sight and demand deposits) and
certificates of deposit - rose 0.2 per cent from October. But the rate of
growth of the broadest measure of liquidity slowed slightly. M2 plus CDs
plus postal savings deposits, government bonds and investment trusts grew by
3.5 per cent in November from a year earlier, compared with a preliminary
3.6 per cent rise a year ago.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Quitting lifts lid on Indian sugar industry: Probe fall-out
draws attention to highly regulated and corruption-prone sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Cabinet minister's resignation has cast an unwanted light into the murky
world of the highly regulated and corruption-prone Indian sugar industry.
The causes of the departure of Mr A K Antony, the civil supplies minister,
lie in the government's mishandling of a sugar shortage earlier this year
which forced the country to pay tens of millions of dollars more for
imported sugar than it might otherwise have done. Sugar producers and
traders, in India and abroad, made bumper profits at the expense of the
Indian government and of sugar consumers.
In June, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, ordered an inquiry into
the affair by Mr Gian Prakash, a retired civil servant, who presented his
findings in September. The prime minister at first refused to publish the
report. But this week, after the ruling Congress (I) party's defeats in the
recent state elections in which corruption was an important issue, Mr
Narasimha Rao responded to opposition party pressure and allowed a junior
minister to present a short written summary to parliament. This vaguely
apportioned blame to almost everyone involved in control of the sugar
industry.
The low-key note, which the prime minister presumably hoped would offend
no-one, outraged Mr Antony, a minister with a reputation for honesty, who
was furious at being bracketed with those he believes responsible for the
debacle.
Mr Antony's resignation has intensified the pressure on those who played a
bigger role in the scandal.
India is both the world's largest producer and consumer of sugar. To ensure
that even the poor can buy sugar, about half the output is sold through
government ration shops at artificially low prices. The rest is sold on a
so-called free market, although even here prices are influenced by the
government which regulates the volume of sugar reaching the stores. Entry
into the industry is controlled by the government which grants production
licences - a lucrative source of bribes.
All this intervention fails to eliminate periodic swings between gluts and
shortages. The first inkling of a shortage this year emerged last winter
when Mr Antony, whose ministry is in charge of food distribution, and Mr A C
Sen, the chief civil servant in the food ministry, warned Mr Kalpnath Rai,
the food minister, that imports were needed. Mr Rai rejected the advice at a
meeting in December of the Cabinet Committee on Prices, which controls
administered prices.
Because of other official business, the committee did not meet again until
March, when rising sugar prices in the domestic market had set alarm bells
ringing. Mr Rai finally conceded that the crop would be smaller than
expected. According to documents leaked to Indian newspapers, Mr Manmohan
Singh, the finance minister who chairs the committee, remarked drily that
sugar production estimates should be assessed independently since 'certain
parties had a vested interest in giving credence to unreliable estimates'.
The committee agreed to allow private imports of sugar and authorised the
state-owned trading corporations, STC and MMTC which are run by the commerce
ministry, to import 1m tonnes to top up the domestic output of 9.6m tonnes.
The first privately imported sugar arrived in mid-April but it was not until
the end of May before the government agencies made their purchases.
The purchases were delayed by arguments between the food, commerce and
finance ministries over who should pay for any losses suffered from buying
sugar at world prices and selling them at (lower) Indian prices. The delays
were compounded by an abortive attempt by the Food Corporation of India, a
third government agency, to make its own sugar imports - a move authorised
by Mr Sen, the food secretary, and blocked by Mr Rai.
As word of India's purchasing plans leaked into the international market, so
prices soared from about Dollars 290 a tonne in January to Dollars 360 by
June. The Indian government eventually imported 1m tonnes - if it could have
paid Dollars 50 a tonne less through more adept trading, it would have saved
Dollars 50m. Private traders imported a further 1m: some of them made a
killing by securing early contracts. Those who bought late actually lost
money since by the end of the summer prices were falling once more.
Once the panic to secure supplies had passed, the attention shifted to
apportioning blame. Under pressure from the opposition parties, the prime
minister ordered Mr Prakash's inquiry. Although it has not been published,
it seems to have exonerated the prime minister personally and spread blame
among other ministers and officials.
All those allegedly involved have denied they were at fault.
If Mr Narasimha Rao hoped that the sugar affair would gradually fade away
amid concern over more immediate issues such as last week's state election
results, Mr Antony's resignation will have soured his plans.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Nigeria's government attempt to thwart illegal currency
dealings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an unprecedented attempt to crack down on the country's black market in
foreign currency and reinforce its controversial exchange rate policy,
Nigeria's military government has made it an offence to disclose the street
value of the naira, Michael Holman, Africa Editor, writes.
In a decree issued last week, the authorities warned that to 'publish or
cause to be published exchange rates and interest rates other than that
approved by the Central Bank' would be an offence.
The penalty for individuals breaching the decree is a fine of N100,000
(Pounds 2,900 or Dollars 4,500) or two year imprisonment, or both.
In January the government pegged the foreign exchange rate at N22 to the
dollar and closed the secondary or parallel market which allowed investors
to bring in and change dollars at the open market rate, which was between
N45 and N50 earlier this year.
The government also capped bank lending rates at 21 per cent. Privately the
government admits the measures have failed, with inflation rising to more
than 100 per cent on an annual basis, and the market rate of the Naira
plunging from N50 to N100 between June and November this year as receipts
from the country's exports failed to keep up with the demand for foreign
currency.

<TEXT>
Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, last night seemed to be
preparing a cabinet reshuffle in an effort to win back public confidence
following the ruling Congress (I) party's defeat in state elections last
week.
Large numbers of ministers offered to resign yesterday in order to give Mr
Narasimha Rao a free hand in rebuilding his government.
The offers came amid persistent opposition attacks on alleged corruption and
incompetence in the government, especially in its handling of the 1992
Bombay stock market scandal and of a sugar shortage earlier this year.
The turmoil was compounded by arguments over the resignation on Wednesday
night of Mr A K Antony, the civil supplies minister, who quit unexpectedly
after he was named in a government note on the sugar affair presented to
parliament earlier in the day.
The note, deliberately written in a low-key way to avoid giving offence,
levelled vague criticisms at several officials and ministers. Mr Antony, who
is known for his honesty, reacted strongly at being tarred with the same
brush as others he believes guilty of incompetence in the affair.
While his resignation is unconnected with yesterday's offers, it increases
the pressure on ministers tainted by corruption allegations.
These include Mr Romeshwar Thakur, the minister of state for finance, and Mr
B Shankaranand, the health minister, who were both named in a parliamentary
inquiry into the Rs40bn (Pounds 820m) securities scandal, in which money was
illegally siphoned out of banks. Mr Thakur was accused in the report of
delaying an official probe into the affair.
Mr Shankaranand was accused of having authorised illegal money transfers
when oil minister and head of the state-owned Oil Industry Development
Board. Separately, Mr Kalpnath Rai, the food minister, has been criticised
in parliament for allegedly mismanaging emergency imports of sugar.
Mr Narasimha Rao has become concerned about allegations of incompetence and
corruption because these issues figured prominently in the recent state
elections in which Congress was defeated. Although voters were more
concerned with their local state administrations than the government in
Delhi, Mr Narasimha Rao seems to believe that the party needs to project a
cleaner image nationally.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Spain to revive Gibraltar leaseback idea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spain is planning to resurrect suggestions for a leaseback of Gibraltar, or
a sharing of sovereignty, that were raised 10 years ago at the first annual
bilateral meeting to discuss the future of the British colony.
Mr Javier Solana, the Spanish foreign minister, will tell British
negotiators on Tuesday in London 'imaginative steps' are needed to end a
diplomatic deadlock and avert a 'mafia-type' takeover of the colony.
One Spanish proposal is that Gibraltar should be leased to Britain for an
unspecified number of years. Another is that London and Madrid would, for a
period, share sovereignty. Under either formula, territorial sovereignty
over Gibraltar would eventually be restored to Spain, though its
institutions and identity would be safeguarded by self-rule powers
negotiated between London and Madrid.
The UK has difficulties with the leaseback suggestion because the British
government is committed to Gibraltar's 1969 constitution. This guarantees
that the UK will not cede the colony to Spain against the wishes of the
majority of its population.
Spain is concerned that Gibraltar's economy, which was once dependent on the
UK's Ministry of Defence, relies increasingly on money laundering and
cigarette and drug smuggling.
Mr Solana will seek firm assurances from Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign
secretary, that illicit activities on the Rock will cease.
Spanish diplomatic protests about Gibraltar's alleged illegal economic
activity have increased in recent months, and Madrid has stepped up border
controls between Spain and the colony.
Madrid officials say the border controls are helping them build up a data
base on money laundering and smuggling.
Spanish police patrols on beaches close to Gibraltar seized three hauls of
hashish weighing a total of 350 kilos last week.

President Leonid Kuchma yesterday abandoned Ukraine's Dollars 10bn (Pounds

Kravchuk, had been criticised over the legality of selling bonds backed by
Ukraine's industrial and natural resources. One MP also alleged the bonds
were sold in the UK and Switzerland, with the revenue diverted to secret
bank accounts. Mr Kuchma's decree dissolves the Ukrainian Credit Fund, which
oversaw the sale of 400 bonds worth Dollars 25m each, and orders prosecutors
to look into the corruption allegations. He also promised that 'all
obligations' to holders would be met. The episode casts yet another shadow

<TEXT>
European Union farm ministers agreed yesterday to abolish the 'switchover'
mechanism, which has cushioned farm prices over the past decade at a cost of
Ecu6bn (Pounds 4.7bn). The switchover is part of the EU's system for
converting farm payments into national currencies. It operated to boost
agricultural prices by 21 per cent over the last 10 years as it revalues
farm payments to follow the upward movements of the strongest EU currency,
which was usually the D-Mark.
The German government, which was in favour of retaining the switchover,
managed to pass a compromise package which offers some compensation to
farmers for currency movements. The new rules compensate farmers if real
exchange rates move three percentage points below or five percentage points
above the green currency rate which is used for converting farm prices. The
compromise was passed against the view of the Commission and the UK
government, which, with Denmark, voted against the package.

Mr Vassilis Sevdalis, the head of Greece's privatisation agency, has been
suspended following allegations of a conflict of interest in the sale of
Piraiki-Patraiki, once Greece's biggest textile company, to a group of Greek
and Saudi investors. A judicial inquiry into the disposal is under way. Mr
Sevdalis, chairman of the Organisation for Industrial Reconstruction (OAE),
an umbrella organisation for disposing of debt-burdened state enterprises,
denied any wrongdoing. But according to industry ministry officials he
admitted being a shareholder in a computer company controlled by the
Vernikos group, one of the investors in Piraiki-Patraiki.
OAE agreed last month to sell the textile concern to Evritania, a company
backed by Vernikos, Olayan of Saudi Arabia and the Katsambas-Stratos group,
its former owner. Evritania agreed to pay Dr6.8bn (Pounds 17.9m) over six
years and re-hire 1,200 workers to start up the company's biggest plant, at
Patras in western Greece. Piraiki-Patraiki shut down three years ago, with

The French Defence Ministry yesterday awarded Matra a FFr2bn (Pounds 230m)
contract to develop a long-range cruise missile, eventually giving France
the equivalent of the Tomahawk, which the US used against Baghdad in the
1991 Gulf war. Matra Defense-Espace, part of the Lagardere group, plans to
develop the subsonic 'stealth' cruise missile, with a range of 400-600km,
using some of the technology from its shorter-range Apache missile already
being producing with Deutsche Aerospace of Germany.
Matra, which is negotiating to merge its missile business with that of
British Aerospace, also hopes to interest the UK Ministry of Defence in a
derivative of the cruise missile. The UK has invited offers for its
programme for the Conventional Armament Stand Off Missile, an air-to-surface
missile with a range of nearly 400km, and Mr Noel Forgeard, head of Matra
Defense, said yesterday that his company would propose a scaled-down version
of the French cruise missile to the UK. The French cruise missile, which
could cost a total of FFr5bn-FFr10bn, was the only big new programme written
into the 1995-2000 military spending framework programme approved earlier
this year.
Matra beat Aerospatiale for the development, but the latter company will be
a subcontractor on the cruise missile's development and was yesterday
awarded another FFr2bn contract to develop a supersonic anti-ship missile.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Dispute over UK colony as hard as the Rock: Spain and
Britain seem unable to control developments in Gibraltar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British officials have long compared annual meetings with their Spanish
counterparts to discuss Spain's claims to the UK colony of Gibraltar to
'visits to the dentist'.
Stepped-up border controls by Spain, which claims that the Rock has become a
drug smuggling and money laundering centre, are likely to make the next
round of talks between British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd and his
Spanish counterpart Javier Solana, scheduled for next Tuesday in London,
more painful than ever.
The 2 1/4 -sq mile Crown colony that nestles under a towering limestone rock
near the southern tip of Spain remains an intractable problem on the
diplomatic agenda of both the British and Spanish governments. The
increasing assertiveness of Mr Joe Bossano, Gibraltar's chief minister since
1988, has served to drive the bilateral talks even further down a dead-end.
The embarrassing truth about the talks is that neither side has anything of
substance to say to the other for both appear impotent to control
developments on the Rock.
In fact, each of the parties involved with Gibraltar has a separate agenda:
Spain wants territorial sovereignty over the Rock which the Gibraltarians
refuse to accept; the UK is committed to respecting the wishes of the
Gibraltarians but it wants to monitor closely what goes on in its colony;
and Gibraltar wants freedom from Spanish claims and from British
interference.
What makes it all the more difficult is that the border controls, ostensibly
to build up a data base on the Rock's drugs business, often result in
six-hour queues stretching deep into the colony's overcrowded urban centre.
Gibraltarians resent it as much as they did the blockade imposed by General
Franco in 1969 and lifted only after 16 years.
Accusations of bad faith, real or imagined whispering campaigns and sheer
ill-temper fostered by past fears and present frustrations have replaced the
optimism that marked the re-opening of Gibraltar's land frontier with Spain
in 1985 and the start of the so-called Brussels negotiations process between
London and Madrid to discuss 'all aspects' of the future of the colony.
Meanwhile Gibraltar, described by Spain's prime minister Mr Felipe Gonzalez
as a 'stone in the shoe' of Madrid's relations with London, has been pushed,
and has pushed itself, into an isolation that is wholly at odds with an open
European economy.
Effective lobbying in Brussels by the Spanish, who claim sovereignty over
Gibraltar, has, among other things, prevented the airstrip, which divides
the Rock from mainland Spain, from gaining the benefits of air traffic
deregulation within the EU.
But the tough tactics employed by Spain as it pursues its 281-year old claim
over Gibraltar are increasingly overshadowed by Britain's efforts to reclaim
a measure of control over a colony that it fears may have cut loose from
Whitehall's moorings.
Mr Bossano believes a return to a virtual frontier blockade is bad enough.
But worse is the squeeze he suspects is being engineered by London to
undermine the colony's attempt to make itself economically self-sufficient
as a step towards self-determination.
The view from London is that Mr Bossano has overstepped his brief by
seeking, though without much success, to set up Gibraltar as an off-shore
financial centre selling banking services to the European Union as a de
facto member but with looser regulations than in the UK. Britain is
responsible for the Rock's external affairs under the terms of the colony's
1969 constitution and Whitehall is firm about its supervisory powers, in
particular those covered by EU directives concerning the financial sector.
The festering relationship between Whitehall and the colony's local
government came into the open this summer when Gibraltar's London-appointed
attorney general, Mr John Blackburn Gittings, resigned nearly a year before
his three-year posting ended.
He had concluded that conflicts of interest in an increasingly politically
charged environment had left him with no option but to stand down. As
attorney-general, Mr Blackburn Gittings had to pursue the dual role of legal
adviser to the Gibraltarian government and legal representative of the
British government at a time of growing tension between Mr Bossano and
London.
At the centre of that tension is Mr Bossano's accusation that Whitehall's
regulatory supervision prevents Gibraltar from developing tax-efficient
financial services similar to those in Luxembourg. 'I think (the UK) is
hampering us,' he says. 'It could be a long-term strategy to make Gibraltar
look to Spain for its future.'
Mr Bossano says the EU allows discretion in the implementation of its
directives and that Whitehall should allow more leeway over those that
directly affect Gibraltar's interests. This makes Whitehall nervous.
'We are making absolutely sure that we have control over financial
regulations in Gibraltar,' says a senior UK Treasury official. 'In the past
the Gibraltarian government has had a very large say and this is no longer
the case.'
Seen from Madrid, the core of the Gibraltar problem is that London has been
too lenient with Mr Bossano. 'We are coming round to thinking that London
cannot deliver anything on Gibraltar,' says a Spanish diplomat who will be
attending the London talks.
At the same time, as the recent border controls demonstrate, Spain is making
no attempt to 'win the hearts and minds of the Gibraltarians', say British
officials. They point out that the Spanish government was angered when Mr
Bossano attended the IMF-World Bank meeting in Madrid in October as part of
the UK delegation and it ignored the chief minister when he said he was
prepared to negotiate directly with Spain.
Madrid was not in the mood for such peace overtures after a 'Gibraltar
national day' that had been held on the Rock the previous month. Mr Bossano
had invited Basque and Catalan separatists to celebrate the colony's
self-determination ambitions.
Then there is the growing evidence that Gibraltar's economy, as it fails to
make headway in its off-shore banking ambitions, is becoming increasingly
dependent not just on cigarette smuggling into Spain, a traditional
money-maker on the Rock, but also on narcotics.
Madrid claims that in the first 10 months of this year 42 tons of hashish
have been seized by its police, as well as 2.3m cartons of cigarettes.
Hashish seized from Gibraltar-based boats last year totalled 38 tons, up
from 10 tons in 1992.
Spanish officials say the Rock is coming close to a Mafia-type takeover:
'Gibraltar's narcotics business is industrially organised,' says one
official.
There are few satisfactory explanations for the presence of 200-odd fast
launches - painted black to help avoid detection at night - moored in
Gibraltar's marina.
The stock response on the Rock is that the launches leave the marina empty
of goods and return empty; whatever might occur in the 9-mile wide Straits
of Gibraltar that separate Morocco from Spain is not the concern of the
colony's government. Spanish police say drugs are loaded in the straits and
off-loaded on Spanish beaches.
Smuggling has increased in importance as Mr Bossano's financial centre
ambitions have foundered - partly because of Spanish opposition and partly
because of timing, given the recent global recession. The financial services
industry's prestige headquarters was to have been a multi-million
development called Europort, work on which began in 1989 on land reclaimed
from Gibraltar's harbour by Baltica group of Denmark. The office towers are
completed but virtually empty.
After dragging Baltica Finans, the Danish group's investment unit, to the
brink of bankruptcy, Europort has continued to haunt Mr Bossano's government
because of a row over fraud and corruption.
British police have been asked by Gibraltar's governor to co-operate with
Danish police following up allegations of fraud linked to the development.
Unofficially, they are looking into whether there is evidence of corruption
by members of Mr Bossano's government.
A former Baltica employee has testified at a Danish court hearing into
Baltica's near collapse that a payment of Pounds 250,000 was made to a
Gibraltar minister in connection with Europort.
Mr Bossano denies any impropriety by members of his government. 'There are
allegations of fraud by Danes against Danes involving Danish money. There is
no Gibraltarian money involved,' he says.
The UK and Spain, as allies in the EU and Nato, cannot allow the Gibraltar
problem to degenerate further. North Africa, clearly visible from the Rock,
is enough of a security flashpoint for Europe as it is.
In the circumstances, the best outcome for the talks next week would be a
realisation by both sides that the Brussels negotiating process has run its
course and that a radically different approach is required.
One way forward, favoured by some Spanish foreign ministry officials, could
be for Madrid to take up Mr Bossano's olive branch and begin discreet
contacts with the chief minister to find out what is on his 'shopping list'.
Should Madrid take such a plunge it might well find to its surprise that Mr
Bossano, who is a tough bargainer but is ultimately a realist, will be
willing to settle for some form of dual sovereignty or leaseback arrangement
that will respect the Rock's identity and institutions. This was suggested
by Spain ten years ago, and Madrid says London has never properly responded.
Mr Bossano needs a deal because he cannot afford to have Europort, the
duty-free shops on Main Street and the hotels losing increasing amounts of
money (the Holiday Inn hotel, the second-biggest, has applied for
receivership). And certainly he cannot afford to have the blackened hulls of
the stripped-down speedboats in the marina as virtually the only sign of
financial success.

</HEADLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden and Finland yesterday announced a slight fall in inflation in
November only days after the central banks of both countries raised interest
rates because of fears of an upward swing in inflation next year. The
consumer price index in Sweden rose 2.4 per cent in the year to November,
compared with 2.5 per cent in the year to October. However, the Riksbank
believes tax rises and capacity shortages will lead to a breach of its
target of 3 per cent inflation in 1995. Also yesterday new orders to
industries rose 1.0 per cent in October from September and jumped 17 per
cent compared with October 1993. In Finland, year-on-year core inflation
stood at just 1.1 per cent in November, compared with 1.3 per cent the month
before. This was well within the central bank's target of 2 per cent in
1995.
A 0.2 per cent rise in prices during November kept Spain's year-on-year
headline inflation unchanged at 4.4 per cent. The failure to reduce price
increases will now make it difficult for the government to achieve its
revised year-end headline inflation target of 4.1 per cent.
Registered unemployment in the Netherlands rose to 490,000 in the three
months ended November 30, from 448,000 in the similar period a year earlier.

FT  16 DEC 94 / France and US raise the stakes in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France and the US, the leading western players in the Bosnian poker game,
have both raised the stakes by promising to get more deeply involved, at
least in the short term.
That was the conclusion to emerge yesterday from a two-day meeting of Nato
defence ministers where ambitious plans for new multinational operations in
Bosnia topped the agenda.
Paris and Washington have both made it plain that deeper involvement for a
short time could be a prelude to abandoning the scene in Bosnia - something
neither wants to do, although it could become inevitable. And, according to
diplomats at Nato headquarters, each country has a hidden as well as an
overt agenda.
France is promoting a plan to regroup and reinforce the UN mission in
Bosnia, which would have the happy side-effect of making it much easier to
withdraw if that becomes unavoidable.
The US has thrown its weight behind the idea of a massive Nato operation to
provide 'cover' for an eventual UN pull-out from Bosnia. If it ever goes
ahead, this operation would also have a side-effect: it would satisfy the
long-standing US demand for effective intervention against the Serbs.
The French plan for upgrading the UN operation in Bosnia will be discussed
next week in The Hague at a meeting of military chiefs from the 11 Nato
countries which are directly or indirectly involved in Bosnia.
Britain, second biggest troop contributor after France, has serious
reservations about the French plans. One reason, say diplomats, is that
London fears a watering down of the authority of General Sir Michael Rose,
the British officer who is UN commander in Bosnia.
The French ideas include the securing of Sarajevo airport; the creation of a
safe corridor between Sarajevo and Split; and the regrouping of UN forces
near the corridor. Whatever their other merits, all these ideas would make
for an easier withdrawal.
As for the US-sponsored plan for a massive withdrawal operation, one effect
would be a transfer of operational control from the UN - whose caution in
Bosnia has infuriated Washington - to the Atlantic alliance. That could mean
that even as they withdrew, western forces in Bosnia would finally take the
action against the Serbs which US politicians have long been advocating.
The scale of the proposed operation, which would be by far the biggest
mission Nato has ever sent into a war zone, seems to grow with every news
report. Under one scenario circulating among Nato diplomats, the exercise
would require 29,600 ground troops and 4,000 airmen for combat roles alone,
plus many thousands more in communications and logistics roles.
Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, disclosed yesterday that the Nato
operation would also envisage removing or destroying the Serbs'
anti-aircraft batteries,something the US is already impatient to do.
However, the Nato withdrawal plan would present all countries with some hard
financial choices. On one hand, it has been estimated that getting the
necessary equipment into position would cost about Dollars 800m - roughly
the equivalent of Nato's entire military budget for the year - while every
month the operation lasted would cost about Dollars 270m.
These are big sums, and, spending them could leave Nato without funds to
finance military co-operation with countries in central Europe. On the other
hand, Canada and Nordic states deployed the best of their armour and
communications equipment in Bosnia, and the thought of abandoning or
destroying them in an over-hasty or poorly supported withdrawal would be
nightmarish.
The six-point ceasefire plan advanced by Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb
leader, has clouded the outlook for any of the plans discussed in Brussels
ever coming to fruition. As one Nato diplomat saw it, Mr Karadzic is clearly
hoping that his new show of reasonableness will divide the international
community by satisfying some countries while leaving others sceptical.
Mr Perry, and Mr Willy Claes, Nato secretary-general, both stressed
yesterday the ceasefire proposals were no substitute for a full-blown peace
plan. Mr Claes expressed doubt as to whether it was necessary for
ex-president Jimmy Carter, or any other high-level intermediary, to talk
ceasefire terms with Mr Karadzic. But Mr Perry was slightly more positive,
saying the Bosnian Serb initiative could help the humanitarian situation.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Prospect of new talks over Chechnya
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GROZNY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A full-scale war in the rebel Russian republic of Chechnya remained in
abeyance last night as the possibility emerged of a new round of
negotiations and rumours spread of the unwillingness of Russian troops to
encircle the capital, Grozny.
General Dzhokar Dudayev, the Chechen president, said he was willing for
negotiations, broken off on Wednesday, to restart - 'at the highest
political level'.
He was speaking after a cabinet meeting at which Mr Paimaz Abubakarov, the
finance minister and head of the Chechen negotiating team, presented a new
position for discussion with the Russians.
Earlier, Mr Abubakarov had told the Financial Times that the new position
depended on the Russians halting hostilities, on the agenda being broadened
and on the level of the negotiating team being raised.
'I believe that to continue to negotiate is the only way to stop massive
bloodshed', he said, a line evidently supported by Gen Dudayev and the
cabinet.
The situation around Grozny remained very tense last night as the first
shell fell within the city itself - on its northern suburbs - and as the
northern division of the Russian forces moved to within 7km of the city's
edge. At intervals, the Russians bombarded Chechen positions on the
perimeter of Grozny, although the firing was lighter than in the past two
days.
In Moscow, President Boris Yeltzin appeared to support the more conciliatory
line emerging from the Chechen leadership. He reportedly extended the
deadline for surrendering weapons for a further 48 hours and agreed to talk
at a higher level.
There are signs that disagreements about the war within the Russian
leadership have afflicted the troops in the field.
The column coming in from the west, commanded by General Ivan Babichev has
been halted for two days at the village of Davidenko, where the road to
Grozny is blocked by women dancing and praying.
Within the capital, the population continues to prepare for war. On its
northern side, emplacements are being thrown up, trenches dug and elite
volunteer regiments, some of them claiming to be ready to fight to the
death, are taking positions in front of the Russian tank column.
The stakes were raised by a Chechen claim that they had nuclear artillery
shells - and the cannon to fire them - but that they would not use them.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Stern warning for Balladur on public deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of France yesterday warned the Balladur government that it must
stop slipping behind its plan to reduce the public deficit, even if it means
raising taxes, to meet the Maastricht criteria for monetary union by 1996.
This sharp warning came as the newly independent French central bank set
monetary goals for 1995. It renewed its pledge to keep annual inflation
below 2 per cent and the franc stable, and to allow M3 - the broad measure
of money - to grow by 5 per cent a year over the medium term, permitting
non-inflationary growth of 2.5-3 per cent in the economy.
Reacting to the slight weakening of the franc in recent days, Mr Jean-Claude
Trichet, the Bank of France governor, said 'speculators (against the franc)
will lose, as before'. He claimed 'in my eyes there is the potential of the
franc appreciating, rather than depreciating'.
France's inflation rate, now running at an annual 1.6 per cent, had been
better than that of Germany and the Netherlands for the past three and a
half years, and, with the exception of one half year, better than that of
the US since 1987.
Exploiting his central bank's one-year-old statutory independence, Mr
Trichet urged the government of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and its
successor after next May's presidential election to 'undertake a decisive
reduction of public deficits'.
In November 1993, France joined Germany in announcing a joint convergence
programme which, in the case of France, was supposed to bring down total
public deficits to 5.1 per cent of gross domestic product this year and 4.2
per cent next year to meet the Maastricht guideline of 3 per cent in 1996.
The outturn of this year's public deficits is 5.3 per cent, and the
government's prediction for 1995 is deficit spending equivalent to 4.6 per
cent of GDP.
Mr Trichet, who negotiated Maastricht for France when he headed the
Treasury, said 'the target of 3 per cent in 1996 will have to be met'.
'It would be unimaginable for France, representing what it does in Europe,
not be within the Maastricht criteria in 1996,' he said. Monetary union in
1997, while difficult, was possible through 'will and continued effort'.
He urged that extra tax revenue from economic growth - which Insee, the
statistics agency, yesterday predicted would be at an annual pace of more
than 3 per cent in the first half of 1995 - 'be devoted to cutting the
deficit'. Non-productive public spending had to be squeezed further, too.
If these two measures were not enough, 'then extra revenues will have to be
raised', though privately the central bank acknowledges that is only likely
after a new president has installed a new government in May.
While vaunting its success in reducing the central government deficit, the
Balladur government has used recent windfall gains in tax receipts to meet
new spending commitments. Under Maastricht accounting rules, the government
cannot use privatisation receipts to plug the deficit gap because the sales
of public companies are subtracted from the state's assets.
Mr Trichet also warned unions to keep their wage demands low and urged
companies to invest and to build new industrial capacity so that, allowing
for a catch-up from the 1993 recession, the economy could grow by 3 per cent
or more without inflation increasing at the same time.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Berlusconi prepares showdown with Bossi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the embattled Italian prime minister, was yesterday
preparing for a showdown early next week in parliament with his troublesome
ally, Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League.
Mr Berlusconi indicated he would be the one to impose a vote of confidence,
rather than leave the initiative to the opposition. His aim is to force Mr
Bossi and his 105 deputies to decide finally whether they back the
eight-month-old, right-wing coalition.
The issue was raised at a meeting yesterday between President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro and Mr Berlusconi. The debate could be staged on Tuesday or
Wednesday, depending on when the 1995 budget clears its last parliamentary
hurdles.
The president has indicated he has few illusions about the durability of the
government. Last month he voiced open disagreement with Mr Berlusconi over
the advisability of calling early elections. However, Mr Berlusconi regards
the threat one of his main cards, believing Mr Bossi risks being one of the
main casualties.
Mr Bossi, for his part, declined to say if he was willing to formalise a new
alliance with the centre-left that would place the League with the former
communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) and the Popular party (PPI) of
Mr Rocco Buttiglione.
Suggestions that almost half the League's 105 deputies were not willing to
follow Mr Bossi in a break with the government were denied yesterday.
Italian ministers should decide today whether to relax the terms of Telecom
Italia's monopoly over certain telephone services, in order to offset the
impact of increased competition in the lucrative mobile telephone sector,
Andrew Hill writes from Milan.
In an indication that a compromise may be found to satisfy the
state-controlled company, the Telecoms Ministry said yesterday that, after
the ministerial discussion, Telecom Italia was likely to sign the joint
convention governing digital mobile phone services.
Telecom Italia has withheld its signature pending a satisfactory reply to
its demands for full liberalisation of mobile phone tariffs and a cut in the
fee it pays the government for its monopoly over other services.
The final ministerial decision could be complicated by the obvious
ill-feeling stirred up this week between Mr Berlusconi and his old business
rival, Mr Carlo De Benedetti.
Olivetti, the computer group chaired by Mr De Benedetti, is one of the
leading partners in the consortium which will operate Italy's new digital
mobile phone network.
The consortium, Omnitel-Pronto Italia, won the licence in competition with
a consortium including Fiat, the automotive and industrial group, and
Fininvest, Mr Berlusconi's media group.
Mr De Benedetti angered Mr Berlusconi by indicating in an interview that his
administration should be replaced by an institutional government.
On Tuesday, Mr Cesare Previti, defence minister and former Fininvest lawyer,
said that the licence had been granted 'unjustly' to Omnitel-Pronto Italia.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Bulgaria backs ex-communists and king: The political revival
of two rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By THEODOR TROEV and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SOFIA, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bulgarian Socialist party (BSP), successor to what was once the eastern
European communist party most loyal to Moscow, is expected to return to
power after general elections this weekend. If so, it will join similar
parties in Lithuania, Poland and Hungary which revived like Lazarus from
what was widely assumed to be death after the collapse of the Berlin Wall.
But an equally miraculous revival has been taking place at the opposite end
of the political spectrum - a surge in popular enthusiasm for the idea of
monarchy in general and for the exiled monarch, ex-King Simeon the Second,
in particular.
The popularity of the king has been rising since the downfall of Todor
Zhivkov, the old communist dictator, in 1989. Even President Zhelyu Zhelev,
a former dissident, who used to be the most popular politician in Bulgaria,
recently came behind King Simeon in public opinion polls.
The 57-year-old king, who lives in Madrid, is widely considered to be closer
to restoration as a modern constitutional monarch than any other exiled
royal claimant in the former communist world. Many of the 49 political
organisations contesting the election have sought to capitalise on the
popular longing for 'a good and just king'.
The socialists have not been able to ride the monarchist chariot for
ideological reasons. But political rivals claim the BSP has secretly
inspired monarchist organisations to register for the election to prevent
them joining the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), the main anti-communist
coalition. Every vote diverted from the UDF serves the BSP cause.
In 1991, most royalists voted for the UDF after King Simeon appealed to
Bulgarians to vote for the 'democratic forces'. This was interpreted as
support for the UDF, although the king refused to urge anyone to vote for a
particular party. Dispersion of pro-monarchist votes, meanwhile, meant that
none of the divided monarchist groups managed to clear the 4 per cent hurdle
needed to enter parliament.
This weekend's early elections result from the refusal of both the BSP and
the UDF to replace the outgoing non-party government of technocrats. This
was led by an academic, Mr Lyuben Berov, but supported by the BSP. It
resigned last September after successfully renegotiating Bulgaria's Dollars
9.3bn (Pounds 5.7bn) foreign debt.
This time around the UDF has failed to attract more than a few of the
smaller pro-monarchist clubs to join its election campaign and has found it
hard to attract pro-monarchist and pro-republican voters. The UDF has
pledged to contest the 1946 referendum which abolished the monarchy, but has
not come out in favour of a restoration.
King Simeon has urged the monarchist groups to unite. But political
infighting and personal power struggles have left voters to decide between
seven big monarchist groups and many smaller monarchist clubs.
All that unites the groups is a desire for restoration of the old Turnovo
constitution. The king's supporters say he is still the monarch as there was
no formal abdication. The royal family was forced to leave Bulgaria when
Simeon was just nine years old after a rigged plebiscite under the new
communist rulers.
This abolished the monarchy in 1946, although the Turnovo constitution, with
the monarchy as head of state, was not changed at the time. On reaching his
18th birthday, Simeon of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha was proclaimed King of the
Bulgarians under the Turnovo constitution.
Opinion polls suggest that more and more Bulgarians see restoration of the
monarchy as a guarantee of stability. Royalists also argue that monarchy
could help build a barrier against further ethnic tensions in the Balkans.
Politicians, eager to seize more power in elections, are more prone to
manipulating ethnic minorities than a monarch capable of rising above such
calculations, they say.
In an interview, King Simeon said that he could provide the country with
'unity, national reconciliation and a sense of recovered dignity'.
The ex-king does not rule out the possibility of co-existence of
constitutional monarchy with a socialist government. But analysts in Sofia
doubt that the monarch could be brought closer to the throne if the polls
are accurate and the politically disciplined BSP defeats the divided
monarchist and anti-communist forces.
The latter outnumber the socialists by a big majority, but have proved
unable as yet to forge the alliances needed to keep the socialists out of
power or put the king back on his throne.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Calm hand at helm of uneasy coalition: The challenges facing
John Bruton as Ireland's new premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   by JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Bruton was once described as 'John Unionist' by Mr Albert Reynolds,
the man he succeeded yesterday as Ireland's new prime minister.
It was an unfortunate slip of the tongue. Nonetheless, the inadvertent
allusion to Mr Bruton's views on Northern Ireland highlights one of the key
differences in government policy likely to emerge with his accession
yesterday as head of a three-party coalition between his Fine Gael party,
Labour and the small Democratic Left.
The feeling in Dublin last night was one of relief after a month of
deliberations and allegations, which had left Ireland in the hands of a
caretaker administration since the collapse of the Fianna Fail-Labour
coalition after a judicial appointment row.
The delay had cast an ill-timed shadow over the Northern Ireland peace
process, straining relations between Dublin and Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing, and halting negotiations on the joint framework document
which Ireland and the UK hope will form the basis for all-party talks on
Ulster's constitutional future.
Ireland still faces a hectic diplomatic agenda, with Dublin due to host the
European Union's 1996 intergovernmental conference. Some analysts yesterday
predicted the coalition might not survive that long.
The potential for discord within such a wide-ranging coalition is clear.
Fianna Fail, licking its wounds on the opposition benches, is in no mood to
be forgiving.
Mr Bruton's Fine Gael is a rural-based conservative party with largely
middle class support which has lost votes to Mr Dick Spring's more urban
Labour party. Meanwhile, Mr Proinsias De Rossa's Democratic Left is an
old-fashioned socialist party and the successor of the Official IRA, when
the Provisional IRA broke away to pursue the armed struggle in 1970.
Even at the last minute yesterday, Democratic Left looked set to pull out of
negotiations once it became clear the party, which has just six seats in the
Dail, was being offered a single cabinet portfolio. Last night the single
overriding preoccupation of all the parties seemed to be a determination to
see Fianna Fail consigned to the opposition.
In Mr Bruton, the government will have calm if uncharismatic leadership. A
former finance minister, he is a plain speaking barrister with 20 years in
the Dail and a wealth of ministerial experience. Politically he is said to
be close to the rural wing of the party, identified with Mr Liam Cosgrave, a
former prime minister.
In February Mr Bruton rode out a leadership challenge, and still could be
vulnerable to attack from the liberal wing of the party associated with
another former premier, Dr Garret Fitzgerald.
Mr Bruton likes to dub Fine Gael as 'part of the great European Christian
Democrat movement'. He campaigned in favour of divorce reform, where there
will be a meeting of minds with Labour and Democratic Left.
On the North, the strains may be difficult to hide. Fine Gael is
historically identified as the party which voted for the Anglo-Irish Treaty
of 1921, which created partition. As a believer in a more accommodating
stance towards the Unionists, Mr Bruton is likely to push for reform of
Articles 2 and 3 of the constitution, which enshrine Ireland's territorial
claim to Northern Ireland.
London in particular is keen to see that Fianna Fail, which has played a key
role in the peace process so far, should not now be isolated. The party, as
the voice of constitutional republicanism (Fianna Fail voted against the
Treaty) enjoys better relations with Sinn Fein than the other parties.
As a result, Fianna Fail's support could be critical if the coalition is to
steer through constitutional reform, which would have to be put to a
referendum.
On the economy, the coalition's problems are perhaps more acute. Mr Bruton
is sometimes described as Thatcherite on economic policy and he certainly
won a reputation for tight spending policies when in charge of finance in
1982 after the profligate years of Mr Charles Haughey's Fianna Fail
government.
Any attempt by Fine Gael to cut taxes and reduce public spending is likely
to be resisted by Labour and Democratic Left.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Carter awaits evidence of ceasefire to take up Bosnian Serb
invitation to mediate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Former US president Jimmy Carter was yesterday waiting for evidence of a
cessation of hostilities in Sarajevo before deciding whether to leave on a
private mediation mission at the invitation of the Bosnian Serbs, writes Our
Foreign Staff.
A White House spokesman said Mr Carter could be 'on his way in 24 hours' if
the lull continued. In an interview with Cable News Network television on
Wednesday night, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic asked Mr Carter to
mediate and proposed a six-point plan to give up some territory, agree an
immediate ceasefire around Sarajevo and the re-opening of the city airport,
release detained UN officers and Moslem prisoners of war younger than 19
years old, and allow free passage of relief convoys.
There was general US scepticism, voiced strongly in Brussels by Mr William
Perry, US defence secretary, and by others, that Mr Karadzic was engaged in
more than a public relations ploy designed to secure some form of
recognition for his regime.
Mr Perry said Mr Carter had promised not to deviate from the existing
international peace plan as the basis for a long-term settlement.
In London, senior government officials said they welcomed any attempt by Mr
Carter to broker peace in the region but admitted they were 'sceptical
rather than cynical' about what such an intervention could achieve.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Telecom Italia set to sign mobile phone pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italian ministers should decide today whether to relax the terms of Telecom
Italia's monopoly over certain telephone services, in order to offset the
impact of increased competition in the lucrative mobile telephone sector.
In an indication that a compromise may be found to satisfy the
state-controlled company, the Telecoms Ministry said yesterday that, after
the ministerial discussion, Telecom Italia was likely to sign the joint
convention governing digital mobile phone services.
Telecom Italia has withheld its signature pending a satisfactory reply to
its demands for full liberalisation of mobile phone tariffs and a cut in the
fee it pays the government for its monopoly over other services.
The final ministerial decision could be complicated by the obvious
ill-feeling stirred up this week between Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime
minister, and his old business rival Mr Carlo De Benedetti.
Olivetti, the computer group chaired by Mr De Benedetti, is one of the
leading partners in the consortium which will operate Italy's new digital
mobile phone network.
The consortium, Omnitel-Pronto Italia, won the licence to compete with
Telecom Italia on the eve of the March general election which brought Mr
Berlusconi to power.
The defeated consortium included Fiat, the automotive and industrial group,
and Fininvest, Mr Berlusconi's media group.
Mr De Benedetti angered Mr Berlusconi by indicating, in an interview
published last weekend, that his administration should be replaced by an
institutional government.
On Tuesday, Mr Cesare Previti, defence minister and former Fininvest lawyer,
told another newspaper that the mobile phone contract had been granted
'unjustly' to the Omnitel-Pronto Italia consortium. Mr Previti said he would
go into more detail 'when the moment comes to explain this abomination'.
Mr Berlusconi himself also launched a thinly veiled attack on Olivetti and
Mr De Benedetti in a letter to Il Sole 24 Ore, Italy's business newspaper,
published ahead of his questioning by Milan anti-corruption magistrates on
Tuesday.
Telecom Italia has demanded the right to set its own prices for mobile
telephone services on the existing analogue network.
The company has built a digital network, with which Omnitel-Pronto Italia
will compete. But the state company argues that if the price of its analogue
services continue to be regulated it will lose subscribers to the new
consortium.
Omnitel-Pronto Italia - which includes US, German and Scandinavian partners
 -claims any concession to Telecom Italia would put it at a further
disadvantage as the new entrant in the market.
Analogue customers can use their phones only in Italy, whereas the digital
subscribers can make calls from other European countries which have adopted
the common 'GSM' standard.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Grozny defiant under Russian shells
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GROZNY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The first Russian shells fell yesterday on Grozny, the capital of the
separatist region of Chechnya, and local defenders began erecting earthworks
to try to sustain an expected full-scale assault. The shells fell on a block
of flats, as a Russian assault meant to crush the defiant Chechen leadership
neared the northern edge of Grozny. The concussion shattered all the windows
on the side of one building.
There was only sporadic bombardment of Chechnya yesterday, but the shelling
of Grozny is the latest in a series of tough Russian manoeuvres, despite
reports that Moscow extended its deadline for the surrender of Chechen
forces from yesterday by 48 hours, that appear to have alienated much of the
population.
The Chechens are too lightly armed to block a Russian assault effectively,
but their defence preparations made it appear that fighting would be bloody
on both sides.
Large numbers of Chechen defenders in crisp battle fatigues patrolled the
road equipped with Kalashnikov automatic rifles, armour-piercing grenade
launchers and shoulder-fired rockets. 'A tank is a rolling coffin,' declared
Mr Ruslan Gulaev, the commander of several dozen Chechens guarding the
highway.
Mixed in with the men were a group of commandos calling themselves the
Ghazivat, fighters who have sworn on the Koran to fight to the death. These
units are identifiable by their green headbands, and call President Dzhokar
Dudayev Imam of the Caucasus. 'When Russia started its aggression, we
regarded it as holy war,' said one. 'Our Imam appealed to the people to
defend their land and their faith. If we win, we become wealthy in the
future. If we die, we'll join Allah and be happy.'
Meanwhile, a brisk trade was going on at Grozny's weapons bazaar. One man
wanted to trade a radio for a box of grenades. Another picked up five
weapons jackets for his fighters. A third wanted to trade his Makharov
pistol for a Kalashnikov. 'I want to kill more Ivans,' he said.
At Pervomayskoi, a village just north of Grozny that has sustained the worst
of the Russian bombardment, many residents have taken to living underground.
There was no talk of surrendering arms, which Moscow has demanded. Instead,
the assault seems to have hardened the resolve to fight. 'If we surrender,
they'll start searching our houses and arresting our young people,' said one
housewife. 'They should have given us a chance to make it on our own.'

FT  16 DEC 94 / Labour inflicts crushing poll defeat on Tories: Heavy blow
to Major as Dudley voters deliver postwar record swing in by-election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party crashed to a record-breaking defeat against Labour in
the Dudley West by-election in the early hours of this morning.
In a disastrous blow for Mr John Major's government, Labour won the West
Midlands constituency with a 29.12 per cent swing - the largest from the
Conservatives to Labour at a by-election since the second world war.
The surge of support which has given Labour an unprecedented lead in recent
opinion polls helped Mr Tony Blair's party to convert a Tory majority of
5,789 at the last election into victory by 20,694 votes.
The Tory vote plummeted from 34,729 in April 1992 to just 7,706.
The swing was the second largest from the Conservatives to Labour in a
by-election this century.
It broke through the 21 per cent swing from the Tories to Labour in the
Mid-Staffordshire by-election in March 1990, which took place at the height
of the poll tax rebellion.
If this morning's result were repeated across the country at a general
election, it would leave the Conservatives with almost no seats in the House
of Commons.
The victory of Mr Ian Pearson, the Labour candidate, was instantly hailed by
the party's senior figures as evidence that it can win a constituency with a
broadly middle-class electorate which has been staunchly Conservative for
more than 15 years.
Mr Blair said the voters of Dudley had 'shown that the Tory agenda of the
eighties has run its course. People are tired of second best for Britain and
are looking to Labour to get Britain going again,' he said. 'We must not let
them down.'
Mr John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, said: 'This is a remarkable
victory for us and a remarkable swing.'
The extent of the defeat stunned senior government figures. Mr Stephen
Dorrell, the heritage secretary, admitted the result was a very grim one for
the Conservatives. 'It's obviously a bad result for us,' he said, 'I don't
disguise that at all.'
The result is unlikely to put immediate pressure on Mr Major's position at
the head of the Conservative party because a leadership contest cannot take
place for another 12 months.
But it will compound the growing disarray among Tory backbenchers who are
already divided over the party's approach to Europe and tax cuts.
The defeat reduces the government's notional majority in the House of
Commons to 13, including the nine Tories who lost or resigned the whip after
a parliamentary rebellion on UK contributions to the European Union two
weeks ago.
However, the willingness of the rebels to continue to vote against the
government means that Mr Major now leads an administration with an effective
overall minority of five votes.
Government ministers found a few crumbs of comfort in the very low turnout
of around 47 per cent in the Dudley West poll. This was well below the 82.1
per cent turnout in the constituency at the last election, but broadly
similar to the figure for previous by-elections in December.
Senior Tory officials said the low turnout suggested that disillusioned
Conservatives had stayed at home rather than vote Labour.
They also pointed out that the total Labour vote had actually fallen from
the 28,940 polled at the 1992 election.
Labour's leaders argued that their campaign tactics, which stressed the
Tories' recent tax increases, had played an important part in the victory.
By contrast, the government's defeat in the Commons over the implementation
of VAT on fuel contributed to the problems faced by Mr Graham Postles, the
Tory candidate.
The swing to Labour yesterday was not as great as the 35 per cent switch
from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats at Christchurch last year.
But it was less than 1 percentage point below the largest swing this century
from the Conservatives to Labour, which took place at the Liverpool
Wavertree by-election in 1935.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Warburg merger negotiations called off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, RICHARD WATERS and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Stanley and SG Warburg yesterday called off talks aimed at creating a
dominant global investment bank because of resistance from Warburg's fund
management arm, Mercury Asset Management, to the merger proposals.
The merger talks broke down after the board of MAM, which is 75 per cent
owned by Warburg, demanded a premium offer for its minority shareholders, as
well as operational independence from Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley's executives indicated publicly for the first time that their
primary motive had been to gain control of MAM. 'MAM was the reason for us
to do this deal,' said Mr Stephen Waters, co-managing director of Morgan
Stanley Europe.
Although Warburg intends to resume its former strategy of building a global
business independently, the breakdown may increase the chance of a takeover
bid as well as merger offers by other investment banks.
It may also renew tensions between Warburg and MAM, which believes that its
institutional investor customers prefer it to be independent.
This year, MAM limited business it gave Warburg in protest at the handling
of a takeover bid.
MAM's board, advised independently by Lazard Brothers, the merchant bank, is
thought to have asked for a premium of up to 30 per cent for minority
shareholders, which would have meant offering them about Pounds 400m for
their equity.
Senior executives of Morgan Stanley said last night they would have been
prepared to pay some premium to the MAM shareholders. However, they were not
willing to accept the demands of MAM for continuing full independence.
Warburg's shares fell to close 99p down at 699p after the announcement,
while MAM's shares fell 67p to close at 678p. MAM shares rose after last
week's disclosure of merger talks on expectations of a premium offer.
In New York, Morgan Stanley's shares closed down  3/8 at Dollars 61.
MAM issued a statement saying its objective had been 'to maintain the
operating independence of its business for the benefit of its clients'. The
company has defended its independence from Warburg in the past.
Lord Cairns, Warburg's chief executive, said the merger had been 'a bold
initiative, but by no means essential for further progress'. He said Warburg
was 'as strongly placed as ever' to become a leading global investment bank.
Mr Richard Fisher, Morgan Stanley chairman, said Warburg would have been 'a
good fit' and the collapse was unfortunate.
Talks broke down yesterday after a meeting in London on Tuesday attended by
Mr Fisher and Mr John Mack, Morgan Stanley's president. The US firm
contacted Warburg to tell it that MAM's terms were unacceptable.
