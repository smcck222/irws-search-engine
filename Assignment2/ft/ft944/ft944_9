FT  16 DEC 94 / Saatchi executives press chairman to resign his post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Maurice Saatchi's tenure as chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the
advertising company he founded, looked increasingly uncertain last night
after the company's top executives said he should stand down.
Mr Saatchi's position was further undermined when the group's financial
advisers, SG Warburg and UBS, told the company they felt Mr Saatchi could
not survive a shareholders' vote.
However Mr Charles Scott, the group's chief executive, and Mr Jeremy
Sinclair, executive deputy chairman, said in a memo they would not support a
call for Mr Saatchi's resignation.
'If a resolution is put to the board demanding the chairman's dismissal we
could not in the best interests of the shareholders support it,' they said.
The memo, also signed by Mr Saatchi, was intended for the six non-executives
attending a board meeting today.
A friend of Mr Scott said last night that the chief executive had signed the
memo in the interests of maintaining peace in the boardroom, but it 'does
not mean he is standing shoulder to shoulder with Mr Saatchi'.
Commenting on the battle by a powerful group of shareholders to unseat Mr
Saatchi, a senior official of the company said: 'I have been authorised to
say the following: 'Most people in the company would accept that Maurice has
a value but not as chairman and not on the board''.
Dissident shareholders say they will call an extraordinary meeting to force
Mr Saatchi out, if the board does not ask him to stand down.
'Morale here would be devastated if we go through eight weeks of a public
campaign to unseat Maurice, ahead of the meeting,' a director said.
Meanwhile, one of the company's leading customers, Sir Colin Marshall,
chairman of British Airways, has intervened in support of Mr Saatchi. He has
written to Mr David Herro, of Harris Associates, the fund manager leading
the shareholders' revolt, saying that 'in the event that Maurice Saatchi was
no longer in a position to direct BA's advertising strategy we would
consider our position'.
Mr David Herro said more than 40 per cent of shareholders had contacted him
to back him.
Friends of Mr Saatchi said they feared shareholders were unaware of the
potential damage if Mr Saatchi were ousted. 'There is a serious risk that
Saatchi would lose the Mars and British Airways accounts,' one said. Those
represent about Pounds 50m or more than 5 per cent of Saatchi's annual
revenue.
Mr Saatchi has made clear to colleagues that he will quit the group rather
than accept a compromise proposal that he stand down to become chairman of
the advertising subsidiary, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising Worldwide.
He has also said he would resign rather than see the holding company change
its name, another demand being made by the dissident shareholders.
A change of holding company name, so that the 'Saatchi' brand is used only
by the advertising subsidiary, is also favoured by a growing number of
Saatchi executives.
Mr Saatchi would, however, agree to an official study into possible benefits
of a change in corporate identity.
The shareholders' campaign to oust Mr Saatchi was provoked by a proposal
that he receive a Pounds 5m option package. However, colleagues of Mr
Saatchi say Mr Herro gave approval in principle to such a package last May.

FT  16 DEC 94 / New Irish PM pledges to continue work for Ulster peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ireland agreed a new coalition government led by the conservative Fine Gael
party yesterday, ending a month of political uncertainty after a scandal
dragged down its Fianna Fail-Labour predecessor.
Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, supported by 85 votes to 74, becomes
Ireland's 10th prime minister, leading a coalition with Mr Dick Spring's
Labour party and the Democratic Left of Mr Proinsias De Rossa.
Mr Bruton, who succeeds Fianna Fail's Mr Albert Reynolds, said the
government's first national aim would be to sustain the Northern Ireland
peace process. In London, Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, said he had
sought an early meeting with the new Irish premier.
Mr Bruton is expected to have his first meeting with Mr Gerry Adams, the
leader of Sinn Fein, at today's session of the Dublin government's National
Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.
Mr Bruton told the Dail (parliament), his government would 'work ceaselessly
and sensitively to make peace a permanent part of our future'.
His election was welcomed by unionists in Northern Ireland. Mr Peter
Robinson, Democratic Unionist MP for East Belfast, said Mr Bruton had a
greater understanding of the Ulster Unionist position than most members of
the Irish parliament.
His desire to change articles two and three of the republic's constitution -
claiming territorial jurisdiction over Northern Ireland  - was a 'promising
backcloth' to his term in office, Mr Robinson said.
Mr Bruton conceded that the government was made up of parties whose 'origins
and policies' were very different. But he insisted that 'differences don't
have to pose a threat'. Fine Gael, a rurally based party with largely
middle-class support, will have eight ministers. Labour, which has projected
itself as a European-style secular party, will have six ministers - the same
number it had in the outgoing administration. However, Labour's Mr Ruairi
Quinn will take over the finance portfolio, the first time it has not been
held by the largest party.
Democratic Left, the successor of the Official IRA when the Provisional IRA
split to pursue the armed struggle in 1970, dropped its earlier insistence
on two cabinet positions.
The main points of the new government's agreed programme include moves to
keep public borrowing below 3 per cent of gross national product; tax cuts
for the low paid; a freeze on privatisation; a referendum on divorce; and a
commitment to the Northern Ireland peace process.
The breakthrough coincides with talks yesterday in Belfast between the
British officials and loyalist paramilitaries.
David Owen adds: In London, Mr Major said he was confident the new Dublin
government would wish to 'sustain together the work we have done over
Northern Ireland'.

FT  16 DEC 94 / When the party is often reluctant to come to aid: The tough
role of being responsible for assistance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Being responsible for aid has long been a task that would daunt many a
British politician.
Aid spending comes low down on voters' priorities, so there is always a
battle to prise money out of the Treasury.
Then there is the need to keep all the various lobbies happy. Business wants
aid to be used to support trade. Many development experts want it to be
focused directly on alleviating poverty.
The Pergau dam case brought these tensions to a head. In its wake Lady
Chalker, now easily Britain's longest-serving aid minister, is left
struggling even more valiantly than before with the need to satisfy everyone
all at once.
Although she acknowledges that the Pergau case will 'undoubtedly have an
effect' on public support for the aid programme in general, she believes
that the ODA is increasingly providing value for money by every yard-stick.
Take the case of the aid and trade provision, which was at the root of the
Pergau case. The rules under which such projects are supported were
tightened last year so that the money goes only to the poorest countries
with a per capita income of less than Dollars 760 (Pounds 463.40).
'A lot of the fury has been as if it was just good for the Malaysian
government or for the Indonesian government or some other government. It
isn't that at all. What I've tried to do is devise a system - which I
believe we've now got - that's on a better basis than it was before.'
One example was the greater Dhaka power project in Bangladesh which is
providing electricity to an area where there was none before and helping
create 250,000 jobs in the recipient country.
It was not the case, as British companies had complained, that German
companies had won the contract to build the Shanghai metro because more aid
was available from their government.
'I don't think that has anything to do with the aid and trade system in
Germany. It has a lot to do with Chancellor Kohl and the sort of dealing
that people are so critical of Lady Thatcher for. Kohl was going to Beijing
and he had his people working on it. It met the (international) rules.'
Some developmentalists suggest Lady Chalker is trying to drum up support for
the aid programme by increasing the role of emergency relief. This raises
the ODA's profile and is the kind of service with which the public readily
identifies.
But the minister denied that this had been at the expense of longer term
development assistance. There had been a number of extraordinary calls for
energy relief such as Bosnia, Rwanda and maybe soon another drought in
southern Africa.
The aid budget has steadily increased in recent years, with a 7 per cent
increase in the overall total announced in last month's Budget. But a sense
of squeeze remains, not least because a greater proportion of the money - 45
per cent at last count - is earmarked for the growing demands of
multilateral agencies such as the European Union and World Bank.
The relative shrinkage of the bilateral aid budget is not necessarily a
matter for regret, she said, because Britain could wield more influence as
part of a group.
'People are actually working more in regional blocs so we have to make that
work better, and I think we can do it. We're getting some very good people
into the EU. The influence of Sweden and Finland on the aid side of the EU
will be extremely bene-ficial to the overall EU programme.'
'We have to get as good quality out of multilateral aid programmes as we can
get out of bilateral aid. Therefore I have turned my attention as to how we
improve the quality of multilateral aid.'
As for the battle with the Treasury to claw back the Pergau money: 'I have a
struggle every single year. If we get that money back it will to me be a
very good thing because I know we can use it. If I don't get it back I shall
regard it as sad but not a catastrophe.'

FT  16 DEC 94 / MoD is urged to sell much of its land
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence should sell large areas of its land, the Commons
defence committee said yesterday.
The MoD owns 561,000 acres of land across Britain and leases a further
39,500 acres. This total is 1 per cent of the area of the UK.
The committee said sites known to be surplus to requirements should be
disposed of. Some sites could be reduced in size and some freehold land
could be sold and leased back.
The committee recommended that the MoD should explore the possibility of
setting up an agency to hold and dispose of surplus land.
The committee's report said: 'We are confident that it should be reduced in
scale, driven not by targets for one-off capital gain, but by military
requirements and assessments of particular sites.'
It added: 'There is scope for greater use of training rights over private
land, including agricultural set-aside land, and of other MoD land, such as
test and evaluation facilities.'
But the committee saw no prospect of military training in the national parks
ending, unless the land concerned was taken out of the parks.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Major in row over early Christmas recess
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An intended goodwill gesture turned sour on Mr John Major yesterday when he
was accused of bringing forward the Christmas parliamentary recess to dodge
a political roasting in the Commons.
In a rare display of public anger, the prime minister vigorously denied that
the earlier break was caused by a desire to avoid a testing question time.
MPs will start their Christmas break on Tuesday instead of Wednesday.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow leader of the Commons, said the scrapping of the
business originally planned for Tuesday would enable the prime minister to
escape a question time session. Mr Major was further angered by her
suggestion that he was resigned to the loss of the Dudley West by-election
and wanted to deprive Mr Ian Pearson, the Labour candidate, of a
high-profile introduction to the Commons on Tuesday.
After an animated conversation with the prime minister, Mr Tony Newton,
leader of the Commons, said MPs ought to know that the recess had been
brought forward a day in response to a request from the office of Mr Tony
Blair, the Labour leader.
After hurried consultations with other members of the Labour front bench Mrs
Taylor insisted that Mr Blair had not requested an earlier start for the
Christmas recess.
She pressed for the reinstatement of prime minister's questions and the
other business planned for Tuesday.
Mr Newton admitted in conciliatory tones that there could have been a
misunderstanding. 'Manifestly the impression had been created in Mr Major's
office that something approaching a request had been made,' he said.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Sleepy MPs plan early nights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bleary-eyed MPs endured a marathon series of debates last night - on the day
that moves were announced to do away with such late-night sittings.
These tests of stamina should become much rarer sights in the Commons once
proposals drawn up by the main parties come into effect.
Amid recent controversy about the long hours which MPs are forced to spend
at the Commons, senior politicians have drawn up a list of changes to the
parliamentary timetable which should be introduced early next year.
They include a pledge by the government to give MPs more time in their
constituencies at weekends and another to avoid late sittings of the Commons
as much as possible.
The proposals, which were announced yesterday by Mr Tony Newton, leader of
the Commons, will reduce the amount of parliamentary business on Fridays.
Instead, private member's motions, which are regularly held at the end of
the week, will take place on Wednesday mornings.
In a parliamentary written answer, Mr Newton said that the Speaker, Miss
Betty Boothroyd, would also have wider discretion to limit speeches by
backbenchers to 10 minutes and by ministers and opposition spokesmen and
women to 20 minutes.
The call for improved parliamentary hours comes amid signs that the current
timetable has badly affected the health of some MPs. Debate on the proposals
is to take place in the Commons on Monday.
Last night's debates, which lasted well past daybreak, gave an opportunity
for backbenchers to raise topics of their choice for a response by
ministers.
The series of short debates was set to be opened after 10pm by Labour's Dr
Jeremy Bray on the issue of 'employment rights after manic depression'.
Other topics expected to be raised were Cyprus, the case for an
international station at Stratford, east London, and the pig industry. The
'night' was expected to end at about 8.30 this morning.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Cabinet quarrel grows over Hercules order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, MICHAEL SKAPINKER and BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A decision by the British government to purchase more than a handful of new
Hercules transport aircraft would severely damage UK participation in the
development of the European Future Large Aircraft, British Aerospace warned
yesterday.
The warning came as a cabinet-level row over how the RAF should set about
replacing its ageing Hercules fleet appeared to gather momentum at
Westminster.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, is understood to be pushing for up to
half the current 60-strong Lockheed Hercules fleet to be replaced with the
same company's C-130J aircraft.
But Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is believed to
favour refurbishment of the current fleet, which the RAF says will need
replacement from 1996. This would enable a decision on a long-term
replacement to be delayed until 2002, when the FLA - for which BAe will
build the wings - becomes available.
If the C-130J is chosen, Mr Heseltine is understood to feel that a maximum
of 15 aircraft - equivalent to an operational RAF squadron - should be
ordered. This would minimise the risk of undermining the FLA's chances of
competing with Lockheed for future orders.
The controversy over the aircraft order came amid signs of a fresh split in
the cabinet over whether the government should offer a referendum on the
next stage of European integration.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has won Mr Heseltine's backing for an
intense behind-the-scenes effort to persuade Mr John Major not to appease
the Tory right by committing the government now to a referendum. Mr Clarke
has told colleagues it would be 'idiotic' to promise a plebiscite without
knowing what, if any, proposals there will be for significant changes to the
structure of the EU.
If Mr Rifkind and Mr Heseltine can reach agreement over the Hercules
replacement, their decision could be rubber stamped by the cabinet, possibly
as soon as next week. But they are said to be far apart at the moment. One
former minister spoke of 'irreconcilable differences' and said he understood
the position was 'deadlocked'.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Chalker warns on recouping Pergau expense
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lady Chalker, the minister for overseas development, has warned that her
ministry might not be able to claw back all the money due to be spent in
support of Malaysia's Pergau dam, even though the use of the aid budget for
this purpose has been declared illegal.
The government has said that the Overseas Development Administration's
overall budget will not be affected for the next two years by a recent High
Court ruling that has forced the Treasury to provide Pounds 48m in planned
support for Pergau from its own reserves.
But on Tuesday, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, left open the question
of what would happen in later years when the British government is required
to pay Pounds 122m to the Malaysian authorities.
Lady Chalker said yesterday she expected there would be some 'very tough
talking' with the Treasury over whether the ODA budget should take cuts
commensurate with the amount being paid for Pergau from Treasury reserves.
'It would be nice to have all the addition, but I don't expect we shall get
it all,' she said in an interview with the Financial Times.
Her remarks are bound to concern aid lobbies which had hoped the court
judgment on Pergau would raise the amount of money spent on projects
designed to alleviate poverty.
Under a High Court ruling last month, the ODA cannot make payments for
Pergau because it is deemed 'economically unsound'.
But in a statement to the Commons earlier this week Mr Hurd said the exact
size of the ODA budget from the financial year 1996-97 would have to be
determined in future public expenditure rounds.
Labour MPs and aid groups fear the ODA will end up indirectly financing the
project because the aid budget will suffer cuts to compensate for the
Treasury payments for Pergau.
Labour MPs reacted angrily in the Commons when the government said it would
not restore the Pounds 24m already spent on Pergau to the ODA budget.
But Lady Chalker said that the government had been through the judgment very
carefully. 'I believe we have complied with what the divisional court said
absolutely to the letter.'
The ODA had not decided how to spend the Pounds 48m that would be returned
to its budget this year and next, she said, but it was likely to go on
emergency relief in countries such as Bosnia and Rwanda.
The aid and trade provision had already been set for this year and the money
would not be used for extra projects in this area, she said, although she
defended the use of aid to help UK trade.
'We have an aid and trade system that is strict and gives British companies
the chance to compete on equal terms with other aid donors who are also
interested in trade,' she said.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seventeen investment firms were named yesterday by the government to handle
the sale of its remaining 40 per cent stake in the power generators National
Power and PowerGen.
Although the 17 have been divided into geographical areas, they will all
have equal status as distributors.
The joint co-ordinators are Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Kleinwort Benson
Securities. Other international managers are Cazenove, Paribas, UBS and SG
Warburg.
North American managers are Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan, NatWest
Markets and RBC Dominion. Managers for the rest of the world are Argentaria,
Flemings, Lehman Brothers, Mediobanca, Nikko Securities and WestLB.
Pre-selling of the shares will begin next month, with the sale itself in
February. The value of the shares is about Pounds 4bn, although this will be
reduced after National Power concludes its recent deal to buy back 10 per
cent of its own shares directly from the government.
The government yesterday appointed Morgan Stanley to advise it on the Pounds
4bn flotation of the National Grid Company. Although the company is owned by
regional electricity companies, the government holds a golden share.

FT  16 DEC 94 / EU ban on milk hormone extended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Union agriculture ministers yesterday agreed to extend a ban on the
controversial milk-boosting hormone bovine somatotrophin (BST) for cows
until the end of the decade following widespread resistance to the product.
Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, was alone in voting in favour
of the synthetic hormone, despite strong consumer opposition to its use in
Britain.
BST, which is produced by Monsanto and Eli Lilley, the US biotechnology
companies, is an artificial version of a naturally occurring hormone in cows
which enhances milk output.
Mr Waldegrave said scientific evidence supported the use of BST. Consumers
and animal welfare activists are concerned about its effects, including an
increase in the incidence of mastitis in cows.
There was some confusion over the wording of the Council of Agriculture
Ministers' final decision on BST. Monsanto said the council had agreed that
some farmers could make limited commercial use of the hormone in order to
gain practical experience of its effects. UK government officials said this
would be restricted to field trials.
The product received approval in the US six months ago and since then it has
been used by 10,000 dairy farmers on more than 800,000 cows, Monsanto said.
The European Commission was concerned about the economic damage that could
be done by increasing milk output at a time when quotas are in place to
limit production. The ban on its use will now last until the milk quota
restriction runs out at the end of 1999.
The commission has agreed to prepare a report on further scientific trials
by 1998. Consumer groups have called on the commission to prevent any milk
produced as part of the trials from entering the food chain.
Monsanto said there was no reason why milk produced using BST should not be
sold to consumers. The company produces BST near Vienna and Eli Lilley has a
production site outside Manchester.

FT  16 DEC 94 / MPs criticise coastguard savings target
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Government cost-cutting plans could affect the Coastguard Service's ability
to respond to emergencies, the Commons transport committee said yesterday.
The service was 'thinly stretched' with fewer staff having to deal with an
ever-growing number of incidents, it said in a report.
Pressures on the service, which is responsible for co-ordinating search and
rescue operations, may have led it to rely too heavily on overtime and
part-time auxiliary coastguards.
The MPs added: 'Given financial pressures under which the agency is
presently operating, we are concerned that its present financial target of
achieving a 6.4 per cent saving in the next 18 months might adversely affect
the provision of coastguard services.'
The savings target followed the abandonment of the government's plan to cut
costs by 20 per cent, after the establishment of the service as an executive
agency of the Department of Transport last April.
MPs were concerned the new target, agreed by the service and the transport
department, may have been set too hastily.
They were 'heartened' by assurances from the chief executive that savings
were agreed on the understanding they would not involve closing rescue
centres or detract from operational effectiveness.
Since 1986, the report said, the number of search and rescue incidents dealt
with by the service rose 81 per cent, from 5,300 to 9,610 in 1993. The
number of people rescued increased 91 per cent, from 8,960 to 17,110 last
year.
Over the same period the number of staff fell 7 per cent to its present 480
full-time officers and some 4,000 auxiliaries.
The MPs heard evidence from unions that staff morale was at 'an all-time
low'.

Direct Holidays, the Glasgow-based direct-marketing holiday group backed by
the Royal Bank of Scotland, yesterday announced its first foray into English
markets with a Pounds 1m investment in running cut-price flights and
holidays from Liverpool Airport.
The company is guaranteeing to undercut the brochure prices of any similar
holiday from Manchester Airport by 21 per cent.
It is tilting at big holiday companies such as Airtours and Thomson, which
run their own aircraft fleets from Manchester and have substantial
investment there in dedicated check-in facilities and aircraft maintenance.
Direct Holidays, founded in 1991 by three former directors of Owners Abroad,
works on the same principle as direct-marketing insurance companies -
cutting out agents, brokers and commission in a mainly telephone sales
operation. It claims to be Scotland's largest direct-sales holidays
business, with a 12 per cent share of the Scottish charter holidays market.
This year it has carried 70,000 passengers using Glasgow and Prestwick
airports, turning over about Pounds 15m. Mr John Boyle, one of the founders,
said current pre-tax profits were about Pounds 450,000 a year.
Liverpool Airport's struggle for growth in Manchester's shadow has provided
the company's first opportunity in England. Mr Boyle's research showed other
regional airports, such as Newcastle, well served by local operators, but
Liverpool had less holiday charter traffic than Exeter.
Two tour operators ceased trading yesterday.
The Civil Aviation Authority said Ultimate Holidays and Transamerica
Holidays were both covered by air travel organiser's licence bonds.
Ultimate Holidays took over Transamerica in July.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Retail sales stagnate as recovery gains strength:
Manufacturers tell CBI demand is buoyant - Stores say customers are cautious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain continues to experience a joyless economic recovery.
Manufacturers have recorded their strongest improvement in overall demand
for nearly six years this month, the Confederation of British Industry says.
But this buoyancy has not been felt in the high street. Official figures
yesterday showed that retail sales stagnated in November and October.
The CBI's latest survey of manufacturing, published today, suggests output
will grow at an accelerating rate in the next four months. By contrast, the
Central Statistical Office yesterday reported that seasonally adjusted
retail sales rose 2.5 per cent in the year to November, the lowest annual
rise since April 1993.
Together, these latest indicators show how higher taxes and a competitive
exchange rate are rebalancing Britain's economic recovery from the
consumer-led growth of a year ago to an export and manufacturing-led upturn.
The data also reinforced a picture of growth with low inflation. The CBI
survey found no net increase in the number of companies planning to raise
prices in the next four months. The British Retail Consortium, representing
90 per cent of the industry, said cautious consumers were keeping 'retail
inflation at a very low level and margins under pressure'.
Warm weather in November also proved bad for retailers. The consortium said
sales of outerwear, warm clothing and accessories such as hats and gloves
were sharply down. 'The mild weather and absence of epidemics again marred
the sales of over-the-counter medicines,' it added.
The National Lottery was a mixed blessing for retailers. Newsagents said
lottery tickets generated significant extra sales but queues curbed sales of
other goods. Lottery ticket purchases are likely to depress the official
retail statistics since they are not included in the CSO's retail sales
total.
Ticket sales in the four weeks to last Saturday were Pounds 205.1m. If that
pace continues, the lottery will scoop up nearly Pounds 2.7bn in a year,
equivalent to 1.8 per cent of UK retail sales.
The details of the sales figures show that retailers are finding it
difficult to attract shoppers without cutting prices. The consortium says
that department stores reported fragrance sales well ahead, but only with
the help of price promotion that had damaged margins.
Seasonal adjustment is an important part of the statistical process at this
time of year; November is normally the second busiest shopping month. While
the seasonally adjusted figures show no change in sales between October and
November, in unadjusted terms sales actually rose by 7.5 per cent.
The CSO's preferred measure is to use a three-monthly average. On that
basis, sales volumes in the three months to November were 3 per cent higher
than in the same period of 1993. Yet the rise compared with the previous
three months (to August) was just 0.5 per cent. In value terms, unadjusted
retail sales in November were 3.4 per cent higher than in November 1993.
Comparing the three months to November with the previous quarter, the
strongest sector was household goods, which recorded a rise of 1.9 per cent;
the weakest was other non-food, which includes stores such as off-licences,
florists and tobacconists, which reported a fall of 0.9 per cent.
However, food retailers reported sales volumes in the three months to
November which were 0.6 per cent higher than in the previous quarter, and
4.8 per cent higher than in the same period a year ago. The consortium said
fresh produce and poultry sold well, and Christmas foods were in demand.
Significant falls in sales of camcorders, video games and home computers
were reported. Yet sales of white goods, televisions and hi-fis were up on a
year ago.
The CBI survey, which covered 1,207 manufacturers between November 25 and
December 14, found that 27 per cent thought their present order book was
above normal, 19 per cent below normal, and 54 per cent normal.
The resultant plus 8 per cent - which the CBI considers indicative of the
trend - was the highest since January 1989. It compared with a balance of
plus 5 per cent in November and minus 19 per cent in December last year.
Export order books were also above normal, although the balance of plus 7
per cent in December was below November's 10 per cent positive balance.
The CBI indicator of companies planning to raise domestic prices was
unchanged: a positive balance of 22 per cent for both months.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Anglian drops universal metering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglian Water, the water and sewerage company, has dropped its controversial
requirement for customers to have their water consumption metered.
Anglian has been alone among the water groups in pressing for universal
metering, in spite of the additional costs involved.
Metering, which is strongly supported by Ofwat, the industry regulator, is
seen by some observers to be a more equitable form of charging for water
consumption than the present system based on the old rateable values of
properties.
The water companies are all considering alternative methods of charging
before a deadline to revise tariff structures by the year 2000.
Anglian, which has 1.6m customers, will continue to install water meters but
will leave the choice of connection to householders.
Most water companies have come out strongly against metering on cost
grounds. But Anglian, which charges about 12.5 per cent of the households it
supplies based on metered water usage, says the extra costs must be balanced
against savings in capital expenditure which come through reduced
consumption.
The company said greater cost-consciousness among metered consumers could
bring savings of up to 15 per cent. Company policy is also affected by the
local climate: the Anglian region has one of the lowest rainfall rates in
the UK, making water conservation more important.
The group's compulsory metering policy has been widely criticised by
consumers' groups, which have argued that it penalises low income households
with large families.

FT  16 DEC 94 / ITC fines Granada Pounds 500,000 for rule breach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission yesterday issued a clear warning to
the ITV companies that programmes should not be vehicles for selling
products when it imposed a Pounds 500,000 fine on Granada Television.
The fine, the first to be imposed by the ITC under powers provided by the
1990 Broadcasting Act, was for repeated violations of the rules on 'undue
prominence' of products by This Morning, the daily magazine programme
presented by Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan.
There were also breaches of rules over the sponsorship of viewer
competitions. Viewers were invited on the October 12 edition of This Morning
to enter a cookery competition, application forms for which could be
obtained only from branches of the Safeway supermarket chain or by buying
She magazine.
The ITC said yesterday that the rules on sponsorship and undue prominence
were designed to ensure a clear distinction between the editorial content of
programmes and paid advertising or sponsor messages.
'The effect of failure to observe these rules seriously damages the
editorial integrity of programmes,' said the ITC. It could have fined
Granada up to Pounds 4.69m.
Granada last night expressed surprise and disappointment that the ITC had
imposed a sanction 'which seems out of proportion to the nature of the
original offence'.
The company, which this week advertised for a compliance adviser to ensure
ITC rules were observed in all its programmes, said it would need to
consider the implications of the ITC decision carefully. Mr Graham Allen,
Labour broadcasting spokesman, last night congratulated the ITC for taking a
tough line against Granada. He said: 'Finally the ITC has bared its teeth
and sent a signal to the ITV companies that it is not prepared to tolerate
blatant breaches of its codes.'
The ITC identified eight code breaches by This Morning since the new
broadcasting licences began last year.
Granada was given a formal warning for an item transmitted on September 21
which featured Mr Victor Kiam discussing his Lady Remington range of
jewellery. Viewers were then invited to win pieces by devising an
advertising slogan for the range. Granada referred last night to isolated
lapses of editorial judgment which generated no viewer complaints and from
which Granada derived no commercial benefit.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, National Heritage secretary, yesterday prepared the way
for the BBC to launch two planned commercial services in continental Europe.
He laid an order exempting the BBC from getting broadcasting licences from
the Independent Television Commission.
The two satellite services - one dedicated to entertainment and the other
news - must not be directed at UK audiences and must operate as if they were
regulated by the ITC.
There must also be transparent accounts between the BBC's commercial
television services - which are operated in a joint venture with Pearson,
owner of the Financial Times - and their publicly funded services.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Work scheme 'misses short-term jobless'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A government pilot scheme aimed at helping find jobs for those out of work
for more than two years is at the expense of the short-term unemployed, a
report by the Institute for Employment Studies has found.
The report found just under half of the employers who participated in the
scheme - which has been on trial since last year in Tyneside, Devon and
Cornwall, east Kent and south-west London - hired a long-term unemployed
person when previously they would have recruited someone out of work for
less than two years.
The Workstart scheme, which is run by the Employment Service and training
and enterprise councils, provides a subsidy of Pounds 60 a week for 26 weeks
and Pounds 30 a week for a further 26 weeks for each candidate hired.
Before participating in the programme, 77 per cent of the 399 Workstart
employers surveyed said they had not recruited anyone who had been
unemployed for more than two years.
Without the scheme, 45 per cent of those polled said they would not hire a
long-term unemployed candidate.
The report found that 17 per cent of the jobs filled by Workstart recruits
were created as a result of the subsidy. In a further 27 per cent of the
jobs, the scheme had a positive influence on the positions offered, by
increasing the working time or the duration of the job, or by leading to the
creation of a larger number of vacancies.
However, in London only 7 per cent of the jobs given to Workstart candidates
were created because of the scheme. The report said this could be due to the
restriction of eligibility in the London trial to those unemployed for more
than four years. It said London employers were more likely to use the
subsidy for existing and hard-to-fill vacancies.
The trial was most successful among smaller, private companies in the
service sector. Two-thirds of those polled had fewer than 10 full-time
employees.
Employers were satisfied with their new recruits, with 80 per cent saying
that the employees met their expectations. Almost all of the employers said
they expected to keep on the recruit after the subsidy expired and
two-thirds said they would be more likely to recruit long-term unemployed
people in the future.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced in the Budget that Workstart
would receive Pounds 7.5m funding for a further 5,000 job opportunities in
new trials around the country.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Main plank of job tribunal plans attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial tribunal users yesterday rejected a central plank of the
government's proposals to reduce tribunal delays and raise standards.
Employers, lawyers and trade unions criticised the government's green paper
for placing too much power in the hands of tribunal chairmen and failing to
address the issue of additional funding.
Chairmen, who are legally trained, sit alongside two lay members
representing the interests of employers and employees. The green paper
suggests chairmen should sit alone in 'relatively straightforward or
technical types of proceedings', which do not include claims of unfair
dismissal and discrimination.
Mrs Janina Schiebler, a lay tribunal member who represents employers'
interests in the Norwich area, said: 'I think you get a more balanced
viewpoint when there are three of us. We sit and discuss different points of
view and we all have totally different questions.'
Employment lawyers, who have been criticised for their increasing
involvement in tribunals, also argue against greater powers for tribunal
chairmen.
Mr Stephen Levinson, head of the employment department of City solicitors
Paisner &amp; Co, said: 'Chairmen sitting alone would help if you are concerned
with getting through cases quicker, but that has to be balanced against the
function of the tribunal as an industrial jury. The criticism put forward is
that tribunals are too legalistic, but you make them more legalistic if the
only person running them is a lawyer.'
The green paper follows a 150 per cent increase in tribunals' workload over
the past five years to 73,000 cases last year.
Delays are particularly long in London and the south-east of England. The
tribunals' budget has risen by 75 per cent since 1988 to Pounds 26.6m this
year and the number of administrative staff has increased by 64 per cent
from 290 to 475.
Mr Levinson, who sits on tribunal user groups in the London area, claims the
system's delays are caused by underfunding.
'They ought to be looking at the resources they put into the administration
of the tribunals. One of the biggest problems at the moment is that they do
not have enough people to cope with the volume of cases.'
The tribunal green paper concentrates on streamlining measures which include
imposing time limits on the presentation and cross-examination of evidence.
Other efficiency measures, such as giving tribunals the power to weed out
weak cases at pre-hearings, won broad approval from all parties.
Mr Peter Skyte represents tribunal applicants as a regional officer of the
white collar union MSF.
He said: 'It seems obvious and sensible to weed out the cases which have not
got a hope in hell's chance of success.
'But the danger is that any extension of the pre-hearing review system will
be used to make life difficult for applicants as a way of frightening people
off even in cases which have a reasonable chance of success.'
However, employers' organisations and trade unions agree with green paper
proposals to give the conciliation service Acas a wider role in resolving
cases.
Mr Peter Martin, head of legal services at the Engineering Employers
Federation, said: 'Employers and employees will be interested in ways of
settling cases more quickly.
'But some of the other suggestions may be considerably more contentious.'

FT  16 DEC 94 / Mercury to end Enfield campaign
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury, the telecommunications company, is to end its television
advertising campaign which features comedian Harry Enfield, it said
yesterday.
The comic has played the part of stuffy Mr Grayson, alongside his friend Mr
Cholmondley-Warner, for 2 1/2 years in the parody of old black and white
newsreel films. During this time the company has gained more than 1m
customers.
The change follows the shake-up announced 10 days ago in which 2,500 staff
will lose their jobs - more than a quarter of the workforce. Mercury plans
to concentrate on business users and is to abandon its public payphone
operation.
The award-winning campaign broke new ground in advertising techniques. The
company said: 'It's been a really brilliant campaign for us but it's no
longer really relevant.'
Last year the company spent Pounds 12m on advertising.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Lloyd's plans rise in motor insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Motor underwriters at Lloyd's of London are investigating the feasibility of
a joint body to increase the number of policies sold by the insurance market
to drivers, Ralph Atkins writes.
Lloyd's syndicates account for about 15 per cent of the private car
insurance market but trade as individual organisations under different
names. This means potential customers contacting Lloyd's central
organisation cannot be passed direct to underwriters, said Mr Peter
Routledge, chairman of a Lloyd's Motor Underwriters' Association working
party.
Competition is also intensifying in the private motor insurance market with
companies such as the Royal Bank of Scotland's Direct Line increasing their
market share by selling over the telephone.
Any joint Lloyd's scheme would have to overcome the problem of deciding how
potential customers should be allocated to different syndicates.

FT  16 DEC 94 / November retail figures confirm sluggish demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Official figures on November retail sales confirmed the impression left by
the Confederation of British Industry survey this week - that consumer
demand was sluggish in the run-up to the vital Christmas period.
Retailers are finding it difficult to attract shoppers without cutting
prices. For example, according to the British Retail Consortium, department
stores reported that fragrance sales were well ahead, but only with the help
of price promotion that had damaged margins.
Mr Hugh Clark, the consortium's trading policy director, said: 'Whilst
spending slightly more overall, consumers have adopted a more cautious and
demanding approach, researching carefully and seeking out the best value,
keeping retail inflation at a very low level and margins under pressure.'
November's 2.5 per cent annual rise in retail sales volumes, seasonally
adjusted, is the lowest increase since April last year. In October the
annual rise was a revised 3 per cent.
Seasonal adjustment is an important part of the statistical process at this
time of year; November is normally the second busiest shopping month. While
the seasonally adjusted figures show no change in sales between October and
November, in unadjusted terms sales actually rose by 7.5 per cent.
The Central Statistical Office's preferred measure is to use a three-monthly
average. On that basis, sales volumes in the three months to November were 3
per cent higher than in the same period of 1993. However, the rise compared
with the previous three months (to August) was just 0.5 per cent.
In value terms, unadjusted retail sales in November were 3.4 per cent higher
than in November last year.
Comparing the three months to November with the previous quarter, the
strongest sector was household goods, which recorded a rise of 1.9 per cent;
the weakest was other non-food, which includes stores such as off-licences,
florists and tobacconists, which reported a fall of 0.9 per cent.
Clothing and footwear sales also fell, both between October and November,
and on a three month on three month basis. The mild weather affected sales
of coats, hats and gloves.
However, food retailers reported sales volumes in the three months to
November which were 0.6 per cent higher than in the previous quarter, and
4.8 per cent higher than in the same period a year ago. The British Retail
Consortium said fresh produce and poultry sold well, and Christmas foods
were in demand.
Significant falls in sales of camcorders, video games and home computers
were reported. Yet sales of white goods, televisions and hi-fis were up on a
year ago.

FT  16 DEC 94 / MPs urge sale of surplus MoD land
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence should sell large areas of its land, the Commons
defence committee said yesterday.
The MoD owns 561,000 acres of land across Britain and leases a further
39,500 acres. This total is 1 per cent of the area of the UK - only the
Forestry Commission controls more land.
The committee said sites known to be surplus to requirements should be
disposed of. Some sites could be reduced in size and some freehold land
could be sold and leased back.
The committee recommended that the MoD should explore the possibility of
setting up an agency to hold and dispose of surplus land.
The committee's report said: 'We are confident that it should be reduced in
scale, driven not by targets for one-off capital gain, but by military
requirements and assessments of particular sites.'
It added: 'There is scope for greater use of training rights over private
land, including agricultural set-aside land, and of other MoD land, such as
test and evaluation facilities.'
But the committee saw no prospect of military training in the national parks
ending, unless the land concerned was taken out of the parks.
It highlighted increasing concern over public access to training and other
MoD land.
'While defence interests must remain paramount, the fact of public ownership
should be the starting point for policies on access to it,' it said.
The committee warned the military authorities that 'legitimate access
carelessly denied diminishes public support for legitimate military
activities'.
It called on the government to provide funds from outside the defence budget
to help maintain the MoD's 700 historic buildings and ancient monuments.
They range from prehistoric earthworks and listed dovecotes to pig sties and
public houses.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Manufacturing demand 'buoyant'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Demand for British manufactured goods is more buoyant than at any time since
January 1989 and more companies are forecasting higher output in the next
four months, the Confederation of British Industry reported today.
In its monthly trends survey for December, the CBI pointed to continuing
upward pressure on output prices, although the number of companies expecting
to increase prices in the next four months is unchanged.
Mr Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate director responsible for economic
analysis, said the latest survey showed that 'the manufacturing recovery is
likely to continue at a smart pace into the new year, with overall demand
improving to its best level for nearly six years'.
The survey, which covered 1,207 manufacturers between November 25 and
December 14, found that 27 per cent thought their present order book was
above normal, 19 per cent below normal, and 54 per cent normal. The
resultant plus 8 per cent - which the CBI considers indicative of the trend
 -was the highest since January 1989. It compared with a balance of plus 5
per cent in November and minus 19 per cent in December last year.
Export order books were also above normal, although the balance of plus 7
per cent in December was below November's 10 per cent positive balance.
The CBI indicator of companies planning to raise domestic prices was
unchanged: a positive balance of 22 per cent for both months. Some 54 per
cent of companies expected prices to stay unchanged in the next four months.
Mr Junankar said that a fuller assessment of inflation prospects would have
to wait for next month's more comprehensive quarterly CBI survey of
industrial trends.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Scots holiday group to start flights from Liverpool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Direct Holidays, the Glasgow-based direct-marketing holiday group backed by
the Royal Bank of Scotland, yesterday announced its first foray into English
markets with a Pounds 1m investment in running cut-price flights and
holidays from Liverpool Airport.
The company is guaranteeing to undercut the brochure prices of any similar
holiday from Manchester Airport by 21 per cent.
It is tilting at big holiday companies such as Airtours and Thomson, which
run their own aircraft fleets from Manchester and have substantial
investment there in dedicated check-in facilities and aircraft maintenance.
Direct Holidays, founded in 1991 by three former directors of Owners Abroad,
operates on the same principle as direct-marketing insurance companies by
cutting out agents, brokers and commission in a mainly telephone sales
operation.
It claims to be Scotland's largest direct-sales holidays business, with a 12
per cent share of the Scottish charter holidays market.
This year it has carried 70,000 passengers using Glasgow and Prestwick
airports, turning over about Pounds 15m.
Mr John Boyle, one of the founders, said current pre-tax profits were about
Pounds 450,000 a year.
The Royal Bank of Scotland recently bought a 22 per cent stake to enable the
latest expansion, which will add flights from Aberdeen and Edinburgh in
1995.
Liverpool Airport's struggle for growth in Manchester's shadow has provided
the company's first opportunity in England. Mr Boyle's research showed other
regional airports, such as Newcastle, well served by local operators, but
Liverpool had less holiday charter traffic than Exeter.
The gap between the two north-western airports was illustrated this week
when Manchester released its November passenger figures - 794,000  -
bringing the total for the first 11 months of the year to more than 14m
people. Liverpool airport handles only 500,000 passengers a year.
Mr Boyle said Direct Holidays was aiming at the 1.4m-population Merseyside
conurbation. It would operate from May until October, offering 35,000 seats
to nine destinations in the Balearics, Canaries, Spanish mainland, Portugal
and Turkey. Aircraft will be chartered from Air Europe, Futura, Caledonian
and Pegasus.
The company is to set up a secure car park for customers, close to the
terminal, charging Pounds 5 a week - half the price of a taxi ride from
Liverpool city centre and less than a fifth of the cost of a week's parking
at Manchester's long-stay car parks, which are remote from the terminals.
Liverpool is opposing Manchester's plans at a public inquiry for a second
runway, arguing its airport should be encouraged to grow to 12m passengers a
year by 2030.
Manchester's second runway is supported by a large majority of north-western
business leaders. Outside Merseyside, most support complementary development
of Liverpool in holiday charter, freight or niche markets, of which the
Direct Holidays expansion will be seen as typical.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Rosyth dockyard in Fife has won a Pounds 100m contract to refit the
Royal Navy nuclear submarine HMS Superb, it announced yesterday.
The 2 1/2 -year contract follows on from a similar contract for a sister
submarine of the Swiftsure class, Sovereign, which is nearing completion.
Babcock Rosyth Defence, managers of the yard, which employs about 3,500,
said work would start immediately and last until mid-1997, providing work

Passenger shuttle services through the Channel tunnel will start next
Thursday after the award yesterday of a safety certificate to Eurotunnel,
the tunnel operator.
The level of fares to be charged will be announced today. They are expected
to be roughly comparable with those charged by the ferries, with which the
shuttles will compete.
The start-up of passenger shuttles is 18 months later than originally
planned. It will complete the range of services offered by the tunnel after
earlier launches of freight shuttles, through freight trains and Eurostar
through services between London, Paris and Brussels.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Gas chief faces grilling over salary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Cedric Brown, the British Gas chief executive, is to be forced to deliver
a detailed public justification of the company's decision to give him a 75
per cent pay rise while cutting staff numbers and wages.
Mr Brown and two other executives of privatised utilities were yesterday
called to give evidence to an inquiry into executive salaries launched by
the Commons employment committee.
Mr Brown will appear at a public hearing in January, together with Mr James
Smith, chairman of Eastern Electric, and Sir Desmond Pitcher, chairman of
North West Water.
Mr Greville Janner, the committee's Labour chairman, said there was
'absolutely no doubt that the committee will want to ask Mr Brown about what
I regard as a very insensitive decision'.
The inquiry reflects growing concern among MPs of all parties about big
increases in executive salaries, especially those awarded to managers of the
privatised utility companies.
In a sign of the government's embarrassment on the issue, Mr John Major
condemned 'unjustified' executive pay rises in the Commons last month,
shortly after it was announced that Mr Brown's salary had been increased to
Pounds 475,000.
The cabinet's industry sub-committee yesterday discussed proposals drafted
with the support of Mr Major and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that
would make executive salary packages subject to affirmative resolutions by
shareholders. Yet there were indications that Mr Major's support for a
change in the law was cooling in the face of difficulties identified by Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
Mr Heseltine told the committee that tougher shareholder powers would hinder
companies' ability to hire the best staff, and warned that changes to
company law might be difficult to draft and might trigger opposition from
Tory MPs.
In the Commons Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, demanded regulation of
'excesses that are offensive to the British sense of justice'.
Mr Major accused him of seeking either rigid government controls on pay or
renationalisation. 'In one sense you oppose monopoly, in another sense you
oppose competition. The reality is that you just oppose the private sector,'
he said.
Later Mr Blair said the salaries of most privatised utility chairmen had
risen three times faster than average earnings since privatisation. In a
letter to the prime minister, Mr Blair said that top salaries had risen by
311 per cent in the gas industry, 497 per cent in telecommunications, 116
per cent in the water industry, and 25 per cent in the electricity industry.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Showroom staff face bleak new year: The reasons for cuts in
pay and conditions planned by British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas's remaining showroom staff face an uncertain future as the
company pursues its aim of turning a loss-making retail business into a
'lean and mean' organisation capable of survival in the increasingly
competitive high street market.
Its business plan has involved the closure of 160 showrooms this year with
26 of the remaining 266 'under review'. Staffing is being cut from 4,000 at
the beginning of this year to a target of 1,300. About 1,000 have already
gone without the need for compulsory redundancies.
But this will not be enough for British Gas to make a profit on its showroom
activities within five years. The showrooms are believed to be losing about
Pounds 100m a year at present, hence the reason for trying to cut labour
costs.
From January 1 the showrooms will be turned into a separate retail business
unit which will be expected to become viable on its own. British Gas has
told trade unions that this will mean a drastic upheaval for staff if the
showrooms hope to survive.
Company negotiators have told the unions that they want to maintain British
Gas's reputation as a 'good employer'. In its proposals set out in October
the company sought to reassure showroom staff it would not impose immediate
radical cuts in their living standards as part of the business plan.
There is no intention to make any changes in pay levels or employment terms
of the existing 3,000 staff until at least June 30, the unions have been
told.
What happens after that will depend on the business performance of the
remaining showrooms during the first six months of next year, although
British Gas has already told unions no pay rise can be expected for staff
next year.
The company plans to introduce new terms and conditions of employment for
new staff. This will mean market-related pay with no automatic salary
progression, and performance-based incentives covering all grades. New
entrants will be paid between Pounds 9,000 and Pounds 9,700 a year.
There is also to be increased flexibility in working hours with reduced
overtime payments, provisions for Sunday working and an end to premiums for
working on a Saturday. Holidays will be cut from a maximum of 33 days a year
to 27 days and there will be bank holiday working.
Sick pay will be reduced for short-service employees and a longer qualifying
period imposed for others.
All staff will be affected by the company's proposal to achieve what it
calls a new balance between basic salaries paid to showroom staff and their
commission. The new system will come into force on January 1, replacing the
current regionally based commission pay schemes.
British Gas wants to make up to 30 per cent of staff earnings dependent on
commission. At present commission accounts for about 15 per cent and is not
linked to business performance.
Under the new scheme every sales worker will be given a weekly net sales
target which will be calculated from how much income each has to generate to
cover their own costs as well as their share of their shop's fixed costs. No
commission will be paid until a minimum group performance level has been
achieved which equates to the particular gas showroom breaking even.
Unions have been told the principle behind the new commission scheme is to
reward real achievement and not mere attendance. Commission payments will be
triggered at various levels of sale above a management-set performance
target. There is to be no ceiling on potential commission earnings.
British Gas says the changes will bring pay rates into line with its main
competitors, where staff earn between Pounds 7,000 and Pounds 9,000 a year
compared with British Gas levels of between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 13,000.
The company can also point out that it is behaving in the same way as the
privatised electricity companies which have over the past two years
recruited new showroom staff at lower wage rates and on inferior terms.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Cancer drug test results raise hopes on treatment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A maverick drugs industry entrepreneur may be about to prove his detractors
wrong with a cancer drug that appears to be as good as existing treatments,
but without severe side-effects.
The drug will be submitted for regulatory approval in the first quarter of
1995 and could be on sale in Europe by 1996.
Dr David Horrobin's company, Scotia Pharmaceuticals, yesterday published
final-stage clinical trial results on EF13, a pancreatic cancer drug, which
show that the life expectancy of cancer sufferers increased by up to
two-thirds compared with patients on chemotherapy.
Shares in Scotia Pharmaceuticals rose 21p to 274p after the company
presented its results to City analysts. With the price rise, Scotia has
become the UK's second biggest biotechnology company by market
capitalisation.
Cancer experts gave the results a cautious welcome. Professor Gordon McVie,
scientific director at the Cancer Research Campaign, a London-based charity,
said the results were encouraging. But he pointed out that the trials, which
compared EF13 with historic data on mortality, would have been more
convincing if the drug had been compared with a placebo in which neither
doctor nor patient knew what was being administered.
Scotia said the promising preliminary trial data meant there were ethical
problems in knowingly withholding the drug from sufferers.
Professor Karol Sikora, cancer consultant at Hammersmith Hospital, London,
said the results were 'interesting' but that 'much more evaluation' was
needed.
Cancer of the pancreas is one of the deadliest forms of the disease, with
about 60,000 deaths a year in Europe and North America. The historic data
suggest that, with the normal treatment regime in the UK, average life
expectancy is just over three months. With the intensive chemotherapy
sometimes used in the US, the figure is seven months. With high doses of
EF13 patients survived for a year on average.
As the trial was not placebo-controlled it is possible that patients on EF13
survived longer because they had been selected for being stronger or because
doctors gave them extra attention.
Success for the drug would vindicate Dr Horrobin's championing of an obscure
corner of chemistry dealing with fatty acids. Normally, drug research is
based on protein chemistry.
The former professor of medicine at Montreal University began by selling
evening primrose oil, a natural source of fatty acids, in health food shops
and used the profits to establish research centres and manufacturing plants
in Nova Scotia, Canada, and the western isles of Scotland. He developed
three drugs for treating skin conditions.

FT  16 DEC 94 / 'Homes for votes' inquiry adjourned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROB EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The public inquiry into alleged gerrymandering at Westminster City Council
has been adjourned, delaying its completion until the new year.
The inquiry was due to end in the middle of next week, but was adjourned so
that questions could be answered in writing by an important witness - Mr
Jeremy Sullivan QC, the barrister who advised councillors on the legality of
their actions.
Many of those accused of gerrymandering through the sale of council homes
have said that they received advice from Mr Sullivan approving the sales.
They have argued that such legal advice should protect them from being
surcharged Pounds 21.25m - the money allegedly wasted through the sales.
However, there is a dispute over what was actually said at a meeting on May
5, 1987 between Mr Sullivan and three council officials.
Last week district auditor Mr John Magill put a series of written questions
to Mr Sullivan to clarify the advice he gave at the meeting.
Yesterday Mr Magill approved an application to put further questions to Mr
Sullivan. This was made by Mr Christopher Clarke QC, representing one of the
accused, Mr Robert Lewis, former deputy chief solicitor at the council who
was at the meeting.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Academics claim audit body is undemocratic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of accounting academics has launched an attack on the authority of
the audit profession's main regulator, the Auditing Practices Board,
claiming that it is undemocratic.
The 36 academics have called, in a written submission to the board, for the
creation of an independent body accountable to parliament.
Mr Prem Sikka, reader in accounting at the University of East London, said:
'To the best of my knowledge this is the largest number of academics ever to
sign a submission and publicly express a vote of no confidence in a standard
setting body.'
The group was responding to a consultation paper on the regulator's future
programme of work. Last week the board published its long-awaited paper on
audit reform - The Audit Agenda.
The academics have attacked the regulator's right to determine policy.
'The APB is a division of a limited company, CCAB Ltd. In our view it has no
democratic mandate to formulate audit policy for the UK, ' says the
submission.
'The APB is owned by six major UK accountancy bodies who continue to control
the agenda and parameters of discussion. It is not independent of the
profession.'
The academics, who have all put their names to the submission, claim that
the board is 'unduly influenced' by members of the big accountancy firms.
'There is no moral or ethical reason for allowing partners from such firms
to make UK audit policy,' says the submission.
The academics also argue that because the standard-setting process in audit
relies on volunteers it will never reflect the views of small practitioners
or interested parties such as pensioners or employees.
'Major firms and their corporate patrons are able to buy influence by
seconding individuals to the APB and its committees.'
Finally the academics say that the board has been diverted from considering
how to prevent further audit failures leading to corporate collapses.
'We urge the APB and its sponsors to join us in calling on the government to
appoint an independent body to regulate all aspects of auditing,' they say.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Housing groups to issue Eurobond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of medium-sized housing associations have reduced the cost of
raising funds by forming a company into which they will pledge future rental
income.
UK Rents (No1) will issue a Pounds 36.6m Eurobond with both interest and
principal repaid from the rents. The company will be a 'special purpose
vehicle' - an arms-length company for the housing associations. Because the
bond is expected to be assigned the highest possible rating from two
credit-rating agencies, funding costs are nearly 1 per cent lower than those
typically obtained by housing associations in recent issues.
The deal, developed by Nomura International, the Japanese securities house,
is the first in the UK but resembles other 'securitised' transactions in
which companies sell pools of mortgage obligations or other 'receivables' to
raise money.
Ms Barbara Ainger, chief executive of The Housing Finance Corporation, said
the deal would enable the associations 'to make full use of the strengths of
their rental income flows'. She added: 'This will enable them to benefit
from a very attractive funding cost for long-term finance and opens up new
international markets for investment in UK social housing.' The corporation
funds and monitors the work of housing associations, which provide low-cost
rented accommodation or home-ownership schemes and control about 4 per cent
of housing stock.
Six associations - Cheviot of Newcastle upon Tyne, Beaver of London, Kelsey
of Orpington, Portico of Manchester, the Portsmouth Housing Association and
Mercian of Birmingham - are involved.
The issue, which has a maturity of 30 years, has been launched at a spread
of 75 basis points (a basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point)
over the UK government bond which matures in 2017. Other issues by housing
associations have been at a spread of between 150 and 165 basis points over
the government bond.
The AAA rating expected from Duff and Phelps Credit Rating and Moody's
Investors Services meant the issue could be placed with a number of new
investors who previously have been unable to buy unrated housing association
issues.

FT  16 DEC 94 / RPI advisers back loan interest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Advisers to the Central Statistical Office yesterday issued a report to the
Treasury recommending that mortgage interest payments should continue to be
included in the official measurement of the retail prices index, with some
small statistical modifications.
The recommendation is likely to irritate some economists, who argue that the
system of measuring housing costs should be changed. Sir Samuel Brittan, the
Financial Times' chief economic commentator and a member of the RPI advisory
committee, argued that the inclusion of mortgage interest payments distorts
the inflation data, since it means that the official RPI is boosted by
interest rate rises - even though interest rate rises are intended to curb
inflation.
The majority of the committee pointed out that the index is not only
intended to provide an indicator of inflation, but also to be a
cost-of-living indicator and is used to upgrade pensions and benefits.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lack of publicity and a series of bureaucratic obstacles are to blame for
the lack of interest being shown in the government's openness code, says the
parliamentary ombudsman, William Lewis writes.
Mr William Reid, reporting on the first eight months of the code of practice
for access to government information, highlighted the steps individuals have
to go through. 'The sequence is sufficiently daunting to deter all but the
most determined seekers after information from going through to the end with
it,' he said.
Individuals must make a written request for information, another request for
a departmental review if the information is not supplied, and then approach
an MP before the complaint can be dealt with by him.
The code came into operation in April amid claims that it would open up
previously secret documents and research held by government departments and
quangos.
However MPs have referred only 24 complaints to Mr Reid, of which he has
investigated nine. Based on the experience of other countries, Mr Reid said
he expected to have received approximately 200 complaints by now.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Customers unaware of new gas measures
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Down at the Peckham gas showroom in south London yesterday customers were
unaware of the impending changes. Detailed leaflets explaining what will
happen were piled on the bill payment counter and there were posters around
the walls to do the same.
But the customers were already finding it hard to cope. Two telephone lines
to connect them with the accounts office to discuss problems over bills
seemed permanently engaged. 'We are using contract staff - and not many of
them. Such a large number in accounts have already taken voluntary
redundancy,' explained one showroom assistant.
British Gas argues customers will be able to pay their bills through any
post office and will be encouraged to arrange payment through banks. In
future, customers will have to ring different phone numbers from outside the
showrooms to deal with gas bill and service inquiries, the reporting of gas
leaks and to receive free advice on saving energy.
The leaflet at Peckham, which is standard through all showrooms, says: 'At
British Gas we're always keen to improve our service. So to give you more
choice and more specialised attention we're making important changes to all
our gas shops.' As it explains, the aim is to 'make sure more staff are free
to help you choose the appliance that's right for you'.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Nescafe price rise ignores the trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nestle, the multinational food company which produces the Nescafe brand of
coffee, said yesterday it will go ahead with a 7 per cent increase in
wholesale prices from December 20 in spite of a sharp drop in world prices
over the past week.
Since the company announced the planned price rise on December 7,
international coffee prices have dropped by 13 per cent. The world market
has fallen by 40 per cent since September as assessments for world supply
have become more optimistic.
Nestle's forthcoming price increase will be the third rise this year in the
wholesale market, and will inevitably push up consumer prices. The company
said yesterday that it does not respond to short-term changes in coffee bean
prices.
Kraft Jacobs Suchard, part of the Philip Morris group and one of Nestle's
competitors, announced yesterday it was cancelling a planned increase in
French retail coffee prices over the next three months. The company said
this was in response to lower world prices.
World prices tripled this year after frosts damaged coffee trees in Brazil
during the main growing season. The market peaked at over Dollars 4,000
(Pounds 2,440) a tonne in September, but by yesterday had slipped to Dollars
2,510 a tonne. Trading at the London Commodity Exchange showed some
consolidation yesterday after a Dollars 200 drop in the market on Wednesday,
but prices remain weak.

Loyalist leaders yesterday emerged from an historic first round of talks
with British government officials and said they were satisfied that
guarantees that the province would remain part of the UK would be honoured.
Mr Billy Hutchinson, leader of the delegation from the Progressive Unionist
party, which has close links with the Ulster Volunteer Force, said after
three hours of talks: 'We are confident the constitutional guarantee is
safe.'
Mr Gary McMichael, leader of the delegation from the Ulster Democratic party
 -which has insights into the thinking of the Ulster Defence Association,
the other main unionist paramilitary group - also said he was satisfied
there would be no change in the constitutional guarantee that Ulster would
remain part of the UK while that was the majority wish.
'We have seen the British government discussion document and we are
satisfied the constitution is safe,' he said.
Mr Hutchinson, who has served a prison sentence for terrorist crimes, said
the questions of arms surrender and prisoners were discussed, but were
secondary to the constitutional question.
He said: 'The surrender of arms is some way down the road. Guns and
prisoners come second after our constitutional concerns.'
The talks came on the anniversary of the Downing Street declaration, nine
weeks after the loyalists announced their ceasefire and six days after the
first exploratory talks between Sinn Fe'in, the political wing of the IRA,
and British government officials.
Like those with Sinn Fein, yesterday's talks dealt with how representatives
of the paramilitary groups might enter the peace process.
Mr McMichael said his delegation also discussed the arms and prisoners
issues. 'The question of arms is something which will have to be dealt with.
But talks are at a very early stage.' Prisoners were high on the UDP's
agenda, he said.
Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland political development minister who
is in overall charge of discussions with the loyalists and Sinn Fein, said
that arms decommissioning was central to the exploratory talks as far as the
British government was concerned. Speaking after the meetings with the
loyalists, he said: 'The surrender of arms is central to the talks. You
cannot have any groups threatening to go back to violence if things do not
go their way.'
Both Mr McMichael and Mr Hutchinson were unhappy with the government's
suggestion in a discussion document that their parties did not enjoy
sufficient electoral support to warrant participation in wider all-party
talks on the future of the province.
Mr Hutchinson said: 'Our mandate is the guns have fallen silent.'
The 10 loyalists involved in yesterday's talks brokered the loyalist
paramilitary ceasefire. The talks are scheduled to resume next Friday.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Delegates with a history of violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 10 loyalists who met senior British government officials yesterday were
in two five-man delegations - one from the Progressive Unionist party and
one from the Ulster Democratic party.
The Progressive Unionists have insights into the Ulster Volunteer Force and
the Ulster Democratic party is familiar with the thinking of the Ulster
Defence Association, the other main unionist paramilitary group.
The PUP and UDP have only two elected councillors between them and won only
0.5 per cent of the vote in the last local elections. Two councillors from
the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist party have recently said they will
defect to the UDP.
By contrast Sinn Fe'in, the political wing of the IRA won 10 per cent of the
vote in the last elections and has almost 50 representatives on the
province's 26 district councils.
Five of the 10 loyalists at the talks in Stormont, the former parliament
outside Belfast, have served prison sentences for terrorist crimes. A sixth
was interned in the early 1970s.
The PUP's Mr David Ervine, who once served a prison sentence for possession
of explosives, has been the most visible loyalist leader since the Loyalist
United Military Command announced a ceasefire on October 13.
He has pioneered the idea that the loyalists must talk to Sinn Fein at some
stage and has tried to distance the PUP from the constitutional unionist
parties.
There was surprise that he did not lead the PUP delegation yesterday. This
task fell to Mr Billy Hutchinson, who served 15 years of a life sentence for
the murder of two Roman Catholics in Belfast's Falls Road in 1974. Having
renounced violence, he is now a community worker in the Shankill Road.
The other PUP delegates were Mr William Smith, Mr Jackie Mahood and Mr
Lyndsay Robb. Mr Smith, a 40-year-old former union representative at the
Harland and Wolff shipyard, was jailed for 10 years in 1972 for the
attempted murder of a Catholic in Belfast. He is now a community activist in
the Shankill area.
Mr Mahood served a prison sentence in the 1970s for attempted murder. Mr
Robb is the only member not have served a prison sentence.
The UDP delegation was led by Mr Gary McMichael, the only member of the
loyalist talks team who is an elected representative. The 25-year-old
councillor from Lisburn is the son of Mr John McMichael, a UDA leader who
was murdered by the IRA at Christmas 1987.
Mr John White was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of a
nationalist senator at Stormont in 1973. He is prisons spokesman for the
UDP.
Mr Tommy Kirkham, a former Democratic Unionist party councillor for
Newtonabbey, recently switched to the UDP because of his dissatisfaction
with the DUP leadership.
Little is known of the other two UDP delegates. Mr David Adams, a
42-year-old father of three from Lisburn, has twice stood in council
elections. Mr Joe English was interned in the early 1970s and was part of a
six-man delegation which visited the US in October on behalf of the
loyalists.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Dudley defeat worst since war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dudley West by-election will go down as the worst Conservative defeat
since the second world war.
The 29 per cent swing against the Conservatives cut their share of the vote
to just 19 per cent from 48.8 per cent in the 1992 general election.
Labour's vote, by contrast, increased to 69 per cent from 40.7 per cent in
the general election, and from its 59.5 per cent share of the vote in the
constituency at the local elections in May.
The defeat reduces the government's notional majority in the Commons to 13,
including the nine Tories who lost or resigned the whip two weeks ago after
a parliamentary rebellion on UK contributions to the European Union.
However, the willingness of the rebels to continue to vote against the
government means that Mr John Major now leads an administration with an
effective overall minority of five votes.
Even more worrying for Mr Major, if this result was repeated in a general
election it would result in the loss of most Conservative seats in the
Commons - raising the prospect of a Canadian-style Tory wipe-out.
Mr David Butler, the leading psephologist, calculates that every
Conservative MP would be defeated on a uniform national swing of 25 per
cent. Even a 20 per cent swing would defeat all but 12 Tories.
The swing last night will be a severe blow to ministers, whose authority has
been battered by recent revolts on value added tax and fishing policy, and
by the struggle to cope with a deep split on Europe.
Although lower than the record anti-Conservative swing of 35 per cent at
Christchurch, won by the Liberal Democrats in July 1983, it equalled
Labour's second-highest ever swing.
The victory was in the same league as the famous inter-war Labour victories
at Liverpool Wavertree in 1935 and Fulham East in 1933, when the party
achieved swings of 30 per cent and 29 per cent respectively.
It significantly bettered the 21.5 per cent swing at Mid-Staffs in March
1990 - the biggest shift in support from the government to Labour in a
Tory-held seat since the Conservatives returned to power in 1979.
There were a few crumbs of comfort for the government. The scale of the
defeat was undoubtedly reduced by the low turnout, which fell to 47 per cent
from 82.1 per cent in the 1992 general election - probably with
disillusioned Tories staying at home.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Insurers, advisers warned on pensions advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life companies and independent advisers will face disciplinary action if
they fail to carry out the regulators' plans for identifying and
compensating victims of poor advice on buying personal pensions, if
proposals put forward yesterday go ahead, Alison Smith writes.
The Personal Investment Authority, the watchdog to protect the private
investor, intends to change its rules so that anyone it regulates who does
not follow the procedures on time will be in breach of its requirements.
A consultation paper from the regulator also suggests relaxing the rules
imposing strict limits on the benefits life offices can give independent
advisers. In October a blueprint for reviewing the hundreds of thousands of
personal pensions sold since 1988 was set out by the Securities and
Investments Board, the City's chief regulator.
Its plan was drawn up after a detailed study found that poor advice had been
given during the selling of personal pensions on a far greater scale than
had previously been thought.
The PIA has set up a pensions unit which will handle cases where the adviser
has gone out of business. Half the estimated Pounds 3m cost will be met
through fees paid by all PIA member companies, with the rest falling on
companies which sold personal pensions through independent advisers.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Government may face rebellion over pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's government could face another rebellion from its
backbenchers early in the new year amid signs that Conservative MPs are
demanding better treatment for more than 400,000 British pensioners who live
overseas.
Little more than a week after a Commons rebellion forced the government to
abandon an increase in value added tax on domestic fuel, ministers are
coming under pressure to grant substantial improvements in payments to
pensioners living outside the European Union.
The pressure on the government is being orchestrated by Mr Winston
Churchill, the conservative MP for Davyhulme, who yesterday tabled an early
day motion demanding that the pensions of overseas residents should be
raised in line with those of domestic recipients.
About 150 MPs from all parties have put their names to the motion, which
calls for an 'end to discrimination against the hero generation who saved
the world from Hitler'. More than half of the signatories are Tory MPs.
Last night one of the Conservatives sponsoring the motion said MPs were
ready to introduce an amendment on the issue in the debate on the
government's pension bill, which is due to be published today. The MP said
there was 'some talk' about the government making concessions to the MPs to
ensure that a rebellion did not take place.
However, the Department of Social Security made clear last night that an
upgrading could cost the state an additional Pounds 230m a year in social
security spending.
The department said: 'The idea that we will make concessions is pure
speculation and we have made no announcement.'
Sir Andrew Bowden, the Conservative MP for Brighton Kemptown who is one of
the signatories, said yesterday that it was 'a gross injustice' that
pensioners had no increase in benefits while they were living abroad.
'I don't think it is reasonable to expect the government to make the
concessions all at once, but they should acknowledge the principle that it
was wrong not to upgrade.'

FT  16 DEC 94 / Life insurer to pay record penalty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK life insurance subsidiary of Irish Life will have to pay a record
amount in fines and costs totalling Pounds 385,000 for widespread failures
in training, recruitment and monitoring of staff.
The Pounds 300,000 fine equals the record penalty imposed by Lautro, the
self-regulating body for life insurers which has been superseded by the
Personal Investment Authority. Norwich Union and Premium Life were fined the
same amount in April.
Lautro also told Irish Life Assurance to pay its costs of Pounds 85,000. The
company has paid more than Pounds 135,000 compensation to 86 investors.
The first set of charges relates to inadequate monitoring and compliance of
the sales force and 'tied' agents authorised to sell ILA products only from
March 1991 to the end of last year. The second charge relates to failures
involving the company's training and competence scheme.
The regulator said that although it had approved the scheme early in 1992,
assessment visits to the company in spring this year revealed that it had
not been fully put into practice.
Irish Life says it is committed to the UK market. Last month, a
re-organisation of the group brought the Irish and UK retail businesses into
a single unit instead of the UK business being run as part of its European
operations.
Mr David Kingston, managing director, said the move would 'underpin our
strategic repositioning in the UK market'.
The UK life sector as a whole is facing increasing costs in order to meet
rising regulatory standards.
At the same time, levels of new business have been hit by public concern
about standards of selling in the industry.
For the six months to the end of June, Irish Life's total new business in
the UK fell by 37 per cent to IPounds 13.2m (Pounds 13m).

<TEXT>
The Northern Ireland peace process has already brought heightened interest
in retail property in the province, with Belfast and the border towns
expected to gain most, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said
yesterday.
Research by the University of Ulster found property and construction
companies were also expecting housebuilding and sales to benefit. The peace
process was expected to bring greater mobility and more religious mixing in
private housing areas.
A rise in cross-border economic activity is also predicted, with the
Belfast-Dublin corridor likely to be the focus of development.
However, local companies anticipate intense competition as companies from
the rest of the UK move into the province.
Mr Denis Rooney, head of the institution working party, said: 'Our report
identifies tourism in particular as offering enormous potential for economic
growth provided the right infrastructure is developed. That means new hotels
and other facilities as well as communications services.'

FT  16 DEC 94 / Major in row over early recess
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An intended goodwill gesture turned sour on Mr John Major, the prime
minister, yesterday when he was accused of bringing forward the Christmas
parliamentary recess to dodge a political roasting in the Commons.
In a rare display of public anger, the prime minister vigorously denied that
his decision to engage in a tactical retreat was responsible for MPs
starting their Christmas break on Tuesday instead of Wednesday.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow leader of the Commons, said the scrapping of the
business originally planned for Tuesday would enable the prime minister to
escape a testing question time session.
Mr Major was further angered by her suggestion that he was resigned to the
loss of the Dudley West by-election and wanted to deprive Mr Ian Pearson,
the Labour candidate, of a high-profile introduction to the Commons on
Tuesday.
After an animated conversation with the prime minister, Mr Tony Newton,
leader of the Commons, said MPs ought to know that the recess had been
brought forward a day in response to a request from the office of Mr Tony
Blair, the Labour leader.
To Tory cheers, Mr Newton called on Mrs Taylor to apologise to the prime
minister 'for the comments you made'.
Mr Tony Banks, Labour MP for Newham north west, scornfully called for a
debate on the health of the prime minister. Backed by Labour cheers and
laughter, Mr Banks said: 'If he is going to get out of his pram like he did
just now in response to Mrs Taylor's question he is going to do himself a
mischief.'
Mr Newton replied that the prime minister showed 'every sign of being and
continuing in vigorous health'.
He said it was not surprising, in the circumstances, that Mr Major had been
'cross' about Mrs Taylor's suggestions.
After hurried consultations with other members of the Labour front bench Mrs
Taylor insisted that Mr Blair had not requested an earlier start for the
Christmas recess.
She pressed for the reinstatement of prime minister's questions and the
other business planned for Tuesday.
Mr Newton admitted in conciliatory tones that there could have been a
misunderstanding.
'Manifestly the impression had been created in Mr Major's office that
something approaching a request had been made,' he said.

FT  16 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Sutherland warns over growing recourse to
anti-dumping actions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, yesterday warned that the
achievements of the Uruguay Round global trade accords could unravel if
governments abused fair trade rules to protect special interests.
In a review of developments in the trading system since spring 1993, Mr
Sutherland said confidence in the new system depended on a willingness to
abide 'by the letter and spirit' of the World Trade Organisation, which
succeeds the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next month.
Nearly 60 of Gatt's 125 members have now ratified the WTO accords and Mr
Sutherland is predicting that up to 100 nations will be WTO members from
January 1.
Presenting the review to Gatt's governing council yesterday, Mr Sutherland
urged 'judicious use' of countries' room for manoeuvre in implementing the
Uruguay Round accords in order not to erode the benefits for world trade.
His anxieties, and those of many Gatt members, centre on the growing use of
anti-dumping actions to keep out cheap imports, and the proliferation of
regional trade groupings. Though both are permissible in principle under
international trade rules, they are increasingly seen as stretching those
rules to the limit and beyond.
Of 91 requests for consultations between 1989 and 1994, the first step in
Gatt's disputes settlement procedure, a quarter related to anti-dumping
actions, the report notes. This partly reflects the rising numbers of such
actions and partly 'an increasingly wide gap in perceptions of the
acceptable limits of actions'.
After a peak of 251 cases in 1992-93, the number of anti-dumping
investigations launched by the 25 members of Gatt's anti-dumping code
dropped back to 226 in 1993-94. However, this drop mainly reflected the
earlier surge in suits brought by US and Canadian steel producers.
Investigations initiated by the European Union and Brazil have risen
sharply, leaving the EU and the US joint 'leaders' in 1993-94 with 47 cases
each, followed by Australia and Brazil. The US had by far the largest number
of anti-dumping measures in force - 306 in June 1994, up from 279 a year
earlier - while the EU came second with 157, down from 185 the previous
year.
However, the report points out that the most frequent users of anti-dumping
actions are also frequent targets. EU companies head the list (89 cases in
the two years to mid-1994), with almost half the cases concerning Germany
and France. China was the biggest single country subject to investigation
(58 cases), followed by the US (45). The last couple of years have also seen
more anti-dumping suits against imports from eastern Europe, notably Russia
and Ukraine.
The Gatt report says 11 new regional trading arrangements - all in Europe -
were notified to Gatt between April 1993 and November 1994, bringing to 40
the total notified over the past five years.
It is generally admitted that Gatt's procedures for examining the
consistency of free trade pacts with fair trade rules are inadequate.
Virtually none of the working parties set up to examine regional trade
arrangements has been able to agree on their Gatt conformity.

union
</HEADLINE>

   OURO PRETO, SOUTHERN BRAZIL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The four member countries in the Mercosur customs union, launched in 1991,
yesterday began a final meeting setting the seal on the formal establishment
of the trade area on January 1.
Foreign ministers from Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay met in the
southern Brazilian town of Ouro Preto, a colonial gold mining centre, to
agree final details about the customs union. The four presidents are due
tomorrow to sign the Protocol of Ouro Preto, which will put the union into
effect and spell out the workings of Mercosur institutions including
procedures such as appeals.
Ministers are also negotiating final lists of products to be exempted from
the free trade area within the four countries, and also from the common
external tariffs (CET) of 0-20 per cent on imports from outside the union.
Mr Jose Artur Denot Medeiros, Brazil's main Mercosur negotiator, said
between 5 and 10 per cent of total trade would retain domestic tariffs for a
further four years to give uncompetitive industries more time to prepare for
customs union. Tariffs would be retained to protect such items as Argentine
paper and Brazilian processed fruit, but will be phased out according to
pre-arranged timetables.
A further 10 per cent of items, mainly sensitive products such as high
technology and capital goods, will not adopt the CET until early next
century. This is designed to help Brazilian companies which are currently
protected by tariffs of 20-35 per cent. Brazil's tariffs will fall, again by
a pre-arranged timetable, to meet the CET of 14-16 per cent for these
sectors.
Brazil and Argentina, which account for more than 95 per cent of Mercosur's
GDP, are also expected to announce details of a package of compromises to
help Argentine wheat compete in Brazil against subsidised exports from North
America. The two countries are also due to approve closer integration
between their two car industries.
Mercosur has led to a rapid increase in trade between the four countries as
tariff and other barriers have been progressively removed. Trade within the
four partners increased from Dollars 3.6bn in 1990 to Dollars 8.7bn last
year. Despite the success of the venture, Brazil and Argentina now want to
consolidate recent gains rather than push for a full common market.
Decisions will continue to be taken by the four countries' governments and
there are no plans to set up a European-style Commission. Brazilian and
Argentine fears about diminished sovereignty snuffed out a Uruguayan
proposal for a supranational court to rule on trade disputes. Instead, the
four countries are expected to announce a complaints process with final
appeal to a previously established, but so far untested, arbitration
tribunal.
Leaders are expected to discuss in detail Mercosur's role within the Free
Trade Area of the Americas, which all American leaders except Cuba last
weekend agreed to set up by 2005 at last week's Summit of the Americas in
Miami. Mercosur has already invited Chile and Bolivia to join as free trade
rather than customs unions members, and both countries will attend the Ouro
Preto summit as observers.

<TEXT>
Non-Japanese semiconductor manufacturers gained a record 23.2 per cent of
the Japanese chip market in the third quarter, up from 18.1 per cent in the
same period last year, US and Japanese government officials reported
yesterday. The rise should help defuse tensions between Washington and Tokyo
over the long-running chip trade battle. In previous trade agreements, the
US and Japan agreed to a target 20 per cent foreign share of Japan's market
for semiconductor products. Before the first agreement in 1986, the foreign
share stood at 8.5 per cent.
Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, welcomed the increase in foreign
market share calling it a 'a very positive development' that showed the
success of a results-oriented agreement but he warned against 'backsliding'.
The Japanese market, which accounts for about one third of world chip sales,
is expected to be worth almost Dollars 30bn this year, according to industry
statistics. 'There is no doubt that the trade agreements have produced
results,' said Mr Andrew Procassini, president of the Semiconductor Industry
Association, a US industry trade group.

<TEXT>
A Dollars 15bn project to develop the Timan Pechora oil basin in Russia's
Arctic circle is in jeopardy following last-minute demands by the Russian
partner for a 50 per cent equity stake.
The western consortium, consisting of Texaco, Exxon, Amoco and Norsk Hydro,
overcame a series of legal and fiscal obstacles and had intended to sign a
protocol agreement this week in the presence of Mr Al Gore, US
vice-president, who is in Moscow to promote trade links between the two
countries. 'This is now the only stumbling block to the deal,' said Mr
Thomas Hazen, president of the Timan Pechora company, who has been
negotiating the project for the past four years.
The consortium would have signed a production-sharing agreement to act as
contractors to the Russian government. Moscow would have retained all
ownership rights to the reserves and received about half of the project's
cash flow in taxes, royalties and profit-sharing. The consortium expected to
spend about Dollars 15bn over the next 12-15 years developing the region.
Archangelskgeologia, the local geological company which discovered the
reserves, estimates there may be as much as 5bn barrels of oil in Timan
Pechora.
But Archangelskgeologia, a government-owned company, has now demanded a 50
per cent equity stake in the project. A company spokesman was quoted in a
local newspaper as saying: 'We are not some kind of Indonesia or Angola - we
do not need to give such a project entirely to foreigners.'
Under the original proposal it would have served as a non-equity contractor
to the western consortium. Part of the appeal of Timan Pechora for western
companies had been the absence of a powerful local oil industry, such as
that found in western Siberia, Russia's main oil region.
Mr Hazen said Archangelskgeologia was not 'financially qualified' to assume
a prominent role - given it did not even have enough money to pay its
workers - and even if it were 'it would take away half of our interest'.
Under the original proposals, Texaco and Exxon would each have had a 30 per
cent stake in the project with Amoco and Norsk Hydro each owning a 20 per
cent share. The partners would have invested funds in proportion to their
equity interest.
Mr Hazen said the project had firm support from the upper reaches of the
Russian government. 'I am confident that this problem can be resolved but
this is a Russian problem which needs a Russian solution,' he said.
Disputes between regions and the central authorities in Moscow over
ownership of oil reserves have been one of the main impediments to new oil
developments in Russia.
The Timan Pechora region is seen as one of the most promising oil fields in
Russia. Nine western companies and four Russian companies are currently
discussing a feasibility study to build an offshore terminal to provide a
direct link to export markets. This would involve another Dollars 2bn of
investment.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (12): Potential for
growth is huge - South America / Future prospects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sharp growth in Brazil's commercial vehicle market is fuelling higher
production while locally-based manufacturers are increasingly looking to the
Mercosur free-trade area (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) for
economies of scale.
But manufacturers are worried about growing imports, particularly in light
commercial vehicles, and despite impressive productivity gains in recent
years local producers still lag behind foreign competitors.
Production of light commercial vehicles is expected to reach 253,000 units
this year, up 13 per cent on 1993. Heavy vehicle production is likely to
increase by 31 per cent to 62,000 units.
And the potential for future growth in the market is huge, say vehicle
makers, pointing to Brazil's 157m population, its important farming and
industrial sector and a land area roughly the same size as the United States
excluding Alaska.
Rolf Eckrodt, president of Mercedes-Benz do Brasil, is optimistic about the
long-term potential: 'The lorry fleet is old, about 12 years on average, and
needs replacing. At the same time there is enormous scope for economic
development spurring demand. For instance, only 9 per cent of roads are
asphalted so far.'
Much of the short-term potential, however, will probably depend on whether
Brazil's economic stabilisation can be maintained. A new real currency,
introduced in July and linked to the country's international reserves, has
brought down monthly inflation from 50 per cent in June to about 3 per cent
in November.
But to consolidate the new currency's future, President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso will have to negotiate tough economic reforms with Congress soon
after taking office on January 1.
The growth in Brazil's commercial vehicle market is part of a booming
domestic vehicle market. Last year production was 1.39m units, up 29 per
cent on the year before. This year production is expected to approach 1.6m.
The increase has been sparked by agreements between the government,
companies and unions which have reduced taxes, increased productivity and
limited wage demands. The agreements were aimed at making Brazil's motor
industry more competitive after former president Fernando Collor began to
open the economy to imports in 1990.
As well as these agreements, the commercial vehicle market has been helped
this year by increasing business confidence following the new currency
launch and by the development of leasing financing for companies. The
proportion of heavy commercial vehicles bought through leasing contracts has
increased to about 40 per cent this year from 9 per cent in 1991.
'Today inflation is under control, there is a strong currency and there is
much more confidence among companies,' says Udo Kruse, president of Ford's
Brazilian subsidiary.
He says a 'snowball effect' is emerging among companies seeking to renew
their often aged transport fleets. 'In April, we sold 660 lorries to Pepsi
and soon after that Coca-Cola and Brahma, a local soft drinks manufacturer,
began to make inquiries.'
The beneficiaries of this growing demand have been the main locally-based
manufacturers - Volkswagen, Fiat, General Motors, Ford and Mercedes-Benz -
which have been improving productivity and quality to respond to growing
competition from imports.
Since 1990, productivity gains have averaged 17 per cent a year, half the
gains has been due to higher volumes and the rest to restructuring,
according to a report by consultants Booz-Allen earlier this year. Vehicle
defects have fallen by 50 per cent during the same period.
Productivity measures have led to job cuts in some companies. Mercedes-Benz
has reduced its workforce from 20,000 to 16,000 in the past two years, while
increasing production to 40,000 from 34,000 vehicles, says Mr Eckrodt.
He adds that the company is attempting to increase radically the contracting
out of work. Today, the company is highly vertically integrated and is
making 58 per cent of the value of the vehicle in house. In future, it plans
to purchase much more from outside suppliers reducing the level of in-house
work to 35 per cent.
Manufacturers know they must continue to increase efficiency if they are to
compete with imports, which have been increasing since import duties were
lowered under Collor and speeded up following the 15-18 per cent
appreciation of the real this year. The government recently cut tariffs
again, from 35 to 20 per cent, after frustrations at local manufacturers'
inability to supply domestic demand, which the government feared would
pressure inflation.
According to Volkswagen spokesman Alberto Boaschi imports of light vehicles
will jump to 60,000, 25 per cent of the market, next year compared to 32,000
vehicles, 16 per cent of the market, this year and 11,000 vehicles in 1993.
While Brazilian productivity is on a par with Mexico's, at 48 hours per
vehicle, it is well behind Europe, at 36 hours, and Japan, 16 hours, says
Ford's Mr Kruse. Even after taking into account Brazil's lower labour costs,
productivity is still 10 per cent below Europe's, according to the
Booz-Allen study.
Manufacturers complain that even after tax reductions conceded by the
government in the motor industry agreements, taxes and non-salary costs are
still much higher than international levels.
Companies say the transition from a closed protectionist market to a highly
competitive one has been too rapid. 'We need a reasonable time to become
world class on quality and productivity,' says Mr Kruse.
Part of the manufacturers' productivity strategy is based around the
Mercosur free-trade area, which companies agree will be a crucial motor for
growth. The Mercosur, composed of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay
and with 192m people and a combined output of Dollars 642bn, starts up on
January 1, 1995. The member governments are still negotiating an agreement
for the motor industry but the process of standardisation and integration of
production between multinationals' plants on both sides of the border has
already begun.
Mercedes' plants in Sao Paulo, the company's biggest commercial vehicle
producers outside Germany, exported Dollars 260m in vehicles and parts to
Mercosur, mainly Argentina, last year, nearly half its total exports.
Imports from Mercosur totalled around Dollars 100m.
The company is planning a transporter vehicles plant for Argentina, making
commercial vehicles below six tonnes, and production of transmission systems
was moved to Argentina several years ago. The future strategy will be for
Brazil to focus on trucks and Argentina on transporter vehicles.
'The most important thing will be the weight that Mercosur carries with
other trading blocs,' says Mercedes' Mr Eckrodt, who believes integration
with other countries such as Chile, and with other blocs such as the North
American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), is inevitable: 'The long-term outcome
will be a Panamerican market including the US and the whole of Latin
America.'

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (14): On the road to
profits - Japan, market is recovering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DENNIS NORMILE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After four years of falling sales, Japan's commercial vehicle market is
enjoying improved sales as Japan's economy recovers. In addition, stiffer
emissions requirements are forcing the retirement of older trucks, and new
draconian penalties for overloading are forcing transport firms to trade up
to larger trucks.
Coupled with the benefits of streamlining efforts by producers, Japan's
commercial vehicle industry is poised to see its most profitable year since
1990.
The Japan Automobile Dealers Association recently reported that unit sales
of trucks in October were up 8 per cent over the same month a year ago, and
unit sales of profitable large trucks jumped 31.4 per cent to 11,178
vehicles.
It was the sixth consecutive month of double-digit percentage increases in
sales of large trucks, those with a gross vehicle weight of 4 tonnes or
more.
This sales trend has led Hino Motors, Japan's largest medium and heavy-duty
truck maker, to forecast a doubling of last year's pre-tax profit. Isuzu
Motors now expects to show a full-year profit for the first time in four
years. Nissan Deisel is also expected to return to the black after a loss
last year.
Hino is so confident of the increased level of demand it has just announced
a 13 per cent price increases for new truck models.
This confidence is partly based on brightening prospects for Japan's
economy. Capital spending is starting to recover and the truck manufacturers
expect some pent-up replacement demand. New truck sales are also getting a
boost from tougher emissions requirements. Air pollution levels in the main
metropolitan areas, especially for oxides of nitrogen, have not fallen to
targeted levels. Diesel-burning engines are thought to be the main culprits
for oxides of nitrogen, so authorities are tightening emissions requirements
for trucks.
New vehicles have had to meet the tightened requirements since December last
year. Older vehicles will have to clear the hurdle as part of their periodic
safety inspections, but depending on a truck owner's circumstances, grace
periods can stretch for up to 12 years.
Older trucks will have to be modernised or retired and the industry expects
that many owners will opt to replace vehicles that do not meet the new
standards.
Those two factors, however, are seen to be having a relatively small impact
compared to new penalties for exceeding rated loadings. Previously,
overloading had been more or less winked at with a fine that amounted to
little more than a slap on the wrist. Overloading came to be a standard
practice, however, and authorities, citing safety and highway maintenance
concerns, stiffened penalties this past May. Load limit violators now face
fines of Y100,000 (USDollars 1,000) and the possibility of six-month jail
terms and the suspension of permits and licenses. Not surprisingly, police
have reported a dramatic decline in the number of load limit violations.
Sales of large trucks have been running at levels of 10 per cent or more
year-on-year every month since May as transport firms buy larger capacity
trucks to stay within rated load limits.
The recovery in demand does not mean that truck makers can ease up on their
streamlining efforts. For one thing, the move to larger trucks caused by the
toughened loading restrictions is seen as a temporary boost, although it
will increase replacement demand in the future. Earlier this year, Hino
president Tomio Futami predicted that the domestic truck market would
stabilise at around 150,000 vehicles a year in the near term. While this is
a vast improvement over 1992, when sales were barely over 115,000 vehicles,
it is still off the levels of the boom years 1988 through 1991, when sales
topped 170,000 every year. What is more, the strong yen has dampened exports
and is encouraging imports.
In the first 10 months of this year, commercial vehicle imports totalled
22,070 vehicles, an increase of 357.4 per cent over the same period last
year, according to the Japan Automobile Importers' Association. Nearly 60
per cent of those vehicles were light trucks built by a Nissan venture in
Mexico. But America's General Motors, in particular, has been dramatically
expanding its sales of commercial vehicles, thanks to the use of Isuzu's
sales network. GM is Isuzu's largest shareholder. And, finally, while Hino
and Mitsubishi Motors are profitable, Nissan Diesel and Isuzu are likely to
be barely so.
The makers recognise that this year's upturn gives them a little more
breathing space but that they will still have to carry through with the
restructuring and diversification plans put into effect over the last
several years.
The most dramatic aspect of that restructuring has been paring the
workforce. Hino says it has managed to cut the number of seasonal contract
workers it needs by half, from 26,000 to 13,000. All the makers have been
cutting overtime hours and reducing new hires. They have also been
restructuring sales outlets and subsidiaries. Isuzu merged an auto-body
subsidiary into the parent earlier this year to reduce management overhead.
The drive to concentrate resources is also seen on the production end. Hino
has ceased production of small passenger cars on consignment for affiliate
Toyota Motor Corp. While this probably reflects the need for Toyota to put
its own production facilities to full use, it will allow Hino to concentrate
on its more profitable truck business. There has also been an industry-wide
drive to co-operate to pare development and procurement costs and realise
economies of scale by swapping vehicles. The four leading truck
manufacturers jointly agreed on specifications for brakes for heavy-duty
trucks. Akebono Brake Industrial will supply identical brake systems to all
four. Co-operative arrangements are particularly thick in the small
commercial vehicle segment, which has not been profitable.
Hino will supply a 5,000 cc diesel engine to affiliate Toyota Motor Corp.
which will use the engine in a delivery vehicle which will be supplied to
Daihatsu Motor, another Toyota group company, on an OEM basis.
A more extensive swap has been worked out by Isuzu, Nissan Diesel and Nissan
Motor. The two Nissan companies will produce 1 tonne trucks and minivans for
sale under the Isuzu badge. In return, Isuzu will supply the Nissan
companies with 2 to 3 tonne trucks. Starting next year, the arrangement is
expected to involve 23,000 vehicles a year. Competition in the light truck
market is only expected to toughen as imports gain a greater toehold.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (13): Eyes turn westward
 -China and the Pacific Rim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAT KENNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A number of countries in Asia and the Pacific Rim are seeking to develop
motor industries, and commercial vehicles feature high on their priorities.
Many nations have turned to the west - especially Europe - to find partners
to help them develop their industrial programmes.
China, the world's largest potential market for industrial products,
including commercial vehicles, is leaning heavily on Europe to develop
transport-related industries. In 1964, Berliet signed an agreement to build
heavy trucks in China, on a progressive technology-transfer basis. That
design remains in production as the Yanan heavy six-wheel truck.
In 1984, the Austrian company, Steyr, now part of the MAN group, negotiated
an agreement to build heavy trucks and diesel engines, initially CKD, but
with increasing local content. Today, local content is just over 80 per
cent, and the agreement has so far produced almost 10,000 trucks over 16
tonnes gvw, and more than 5,000 engines for other purposes. Its success
means that further development beyond 1998 is under review in the eighth
five-year plan.
A similar agreement by Iveco in 1988 to build a modified version of the
'Daily', a vehicle family in the 3.5 to six-tonne class, is in full
production. By late 1994, 65 per cent local content was achieved.
Numerous components companies are manufacturing in China on a joint-venture,
technology-transfer basis, including ZF and Eaton, Bosch, Cummins, Lucas and
Rockwell. It is accepted that negotiations with the Chinese industry
agencies cannot be hurried. Steyr's agreement required six years of
negotiations. That does not dissuade others from trying and the Chinese
agencies remain keen to develop their heavy vehicle industry.
In October 1994, Volvo signed a letter of intent with China National Heavy
truck Corporation (CNHTC) to establish a joint venture company to
manufacture heavy trucks. So far, no dates or investment levels have been
defined, but Volvo Truck's president, Karl-Erling Trogen, has declared that
the Chinese project is 'an integral part of an aggressive expansion
programme in Asia'.
For many years Mercedes-Benz has operated a modest joint venture in Mongolia
called Norinco producing chassis and axles for incorporation into other
vehicles, but is now negotiating with CNHTC to upgrade this to full
technology-transfer heavy vehicle manufacturing. Construction of new
manufacturing facilities was completed during 1994, and a new heavy truck is
expected to roll off the production soon. A letter of intent aimed at a
joint venture with Yangzhou Motor Coach Manufacturing aims at building up to
6,000 complete units a year plus a similar number of chassis for local
body-builders to complete.
While the spotlight tends to fall on China, a great deal of activity is
evident in countries throughout the region.
One of the catalysts for this upsurge in business is the development of oil
and natural gas resources, in China, Indonesia and Malaysia in particular.
For the first time, economical operation of large fleets has become
feasible. Some estimates put China's bus requirement at 30,000 units a year
early in the next century. Rapid industrial expansion in Korea, Malaysia,
Taiwan, Vietnam and Indonesia demands high levels of technology input, and
here, too, European companies are leading the way.
Iveco established a joint venture in Vietnam to build medium-weight trucks
and buses, early this year, and that project is now nearly ready to produce
the first vehicles. . MAN is exploiting considerable expertise in the use of
CNG (compressed natural gas) to power buses, and city trucks. It is
providing substantial numbers of buses to Malaysia and Indonesia, and is
negotiating an agreement for a joint venture, to supply several countries in
the region.
Recognising the difficulties of China, Scania is developing a multi-location
strategy, and in 1993 sold more than 1,300 heavy-duty trucks in the region
with 1,600 expected this year. Scania has bases in South Korea, Hong Kong,
and Thailand, with independent importers in more than a dozen territories.
The principal products are heavy tractive units to haul containers and bulk
tanks. Bus business began in 1993, and more than 50 units were sold in
Malaysia in 1994.
Mercedes-Benz has become very active in the region, following the success of
its deal with Ssangyong Motor in South Korea, which provides engines and
technology for cars and light commercial vehicles. A new agreement suggests
50,000 units a year being produced by 1996.
In mid-1994, Mercedes' Indonesian partner, German Motor Manufacturing (GMM),
began producing a truck range in the 6 to 8-tonne gvw class, and a bus
version will follow in 1995. This range, called MB700, is intended to supply
neighbouring territories as well as Indonesia, and represents a joint
investment of USDollars 42m. Mercedes has joint or independent partners in
15 territories in the Asian region and opened a central parts store in
Singapore in 1994 to support them.
India has become an important international element in the past year,
following a decade of quietly developing its internal markets. Following the
acquisition by Iveco of a substantial holding in Ashok Leyland in 1992, and
rapid development of trucks and buses for Asian and African markets,
Mercedes-Benz has renewed its interest in India. The vehicle operation of
the huge Telco conglomerate (Tata Engineering &amp; Locomotive Co) was once a
joint venture with Mercedes, but became wholly independent in the 1970s. Now
Mercedes has established a new agreement with Telco. While this agreement
covers passenger cars principally, it is acknowledged that Mercedes
technology will help to develop Tata commercials, too. In recent years, Tata
trucks and buses have been successful in south-east Asia and Africa, due to
rugged dependability and ease of maintenance.
Much the same can be said of Ashok Leyland which, as well as older
Leyland-based designs, recently added a simplified version of the Ford Cargo
for domestic and export markets. Between them, Ashok and Telco are building
more than 70,000 trucks and buses a year over 5 tonnes gvw, and about twice
that number in the lighter sectors. Telco is already exporting light
commercial vehicles to France and the UK, and has an agreement with Cummins
to manufacture diesel engines.
Why is there so much co-operation between Asia and Europe, rather than
Japan? The main attraction is that European companies are more willing to
engage in full technology-transfer than the Japanese commercial vehicle
makers. Another reason is that Japanese domestic restrictions on heavy
vehicles mean that European makers have more expertise to offer.
Consequently, India, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Taiwan, South Korea and
others see themselves as genuine international vehicle producers in the
future.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (9): High cost of new
standards - Regulation / Implementation of the new rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Little more than a year after the European Commission's Euro I rules curbing
exhaust pollution by heavy goods vehicles, Europe's truck makers are well
down the road to overcoming the greater cost and other problems of a further
phase of legislation - the much stricter standards of Euro II.
The Euro I standards became mandatory on October 1 last year. The Euro II
standards, which require almost a halving of the Euro I emissions, come into
effect on October 1, 1996, for all trucks in production at that time, and a
year earlier for new designs of trucks.
However, already the steady trickle of new truck designs for which
manufacturers have to obtain legislative approval - or homologation - are
virtually all conforming to Euro II. The leading truck engine makers have,
indeed, been increasingly launching Euro II-compliant engines for well over
a year.
The industry has had relatively little technical difficulty meeting the Euro
II standards, although the investment required in manufacturing and design
changes has been substantial.
'The problem has been one not so much of technical difficulty as of time,'
says Ron Armstrong, product marketing manager of Iveco-Ford.
More recent engines have been designed from the start to meet the Euro II
standards, he points out. But other engines, designed earlier but which
require further use to be financially viable, are needing more work to
upgrade them to the standards. Even so, he estimates that his own company's
ranges will be progressively brought up to Euro II levels by next spring.
The cost of compliance for each range can vary considerably, from a few
pounds for modifying injector holes on recent units to up to Pounds 1,000 on
complicated intercooled and turbo-charged engines.
In terms of costs to manufacturers, Mr Armstrong estimates that Iveco-Ford
has spent some Pounds 1bn over its half-a-dozen engine ranges.
The standards, which apply to all engines above 150 kilowatts (brake
horsepower) require a more than halving of carbon monoxide emissions to 4
grammes per kw (from 9 in Euro I), to 1.l grammes/kw of hydrocarbons (from
1.7), 7 grammes of nitrogen oxides (from 11.5) and 0.15 of particulates (the
cause of diesel 'soot'), down from 0.36.
The petroleum industry is also being obliged to play a part in reaching
these levels. Reaching the particulates target requires lower-sulphur fuels.
Thus, under an EU-set timetable, the 0.2-0.3 per cent sulphur content usual
in diesel fuels will have dropped to a maximum of 0.05 per cent by the time
Euro II is fully effective. To cater for the first stage of the Euro II
standards by October 1, 1995, at least 25 per cent of the diesel fuel
available in EU member states must be below the 0.05 per cent ceiling.
Towards the end of the decade, theoretically in 1999, yet another tightening
 -Euro III - will be introduced, although EU member states have not reached
sufficient of a consensus on what they should be for the European Commission
to be able to publish a draft directive.
However, Mr Armstrong says he thinks it likely that they will closely
resemble proposals drawn up by Germany.
These call for carbon monoxide levels to be cut to 2.0-2.8 grammes,
hydrocarbons to 0.6-0.77 grammes, nitrogen oxides to 4.7-5 grammes and
particulates to 0.1 grammes.
If adopted these would represent a much stiffer technological challenge to
the industry, particularly since the test driving cycle - a simulated
'typical' route - is also to be changed to reflect modern traffic
conditions.
The current EU test cycle is a much-criticised slow speed one, still not
reflecting that 80 per cent of the EU's goods are moved by truck across
ever-longer distances along high-speed motorways.
Even so, companies such as Iveco, Volvo and Leyland DAF do not doubt the
industry's ability to meet them - and hope they will be able to do so
without having to resort to some technologies in which they do not wish to
become involved. Notable among these is the particulate trap - to collect
the soot-forming particles in a chamber off a more complex exhaust system,
in order to burn them off when the vehicle is not in use.
They hope, but are by no means certain, that they will be able to meet even
the Euro III standards with further refinement - mainly through increased
electronic control - of high-pressure fuel injection and other engine
management systems. For example, instantaneous adjustments can be made to
fuelling quantity and timing in each injector, under the control of a
central computer taking readings from various sensors around the engine.
Exhaust gas recirculation (EGC), or passing exhaust gas back through the
engine again for more complete combustion, is also likely.
That presumes that the final Euro III standards are not significantly
tighter than the German proposals - 'the German proposals are about the
limit before going down these other routes,' says Mr Armstrong.
Development of Euro III-compliant engines is well under way - not least
because manufacturers think it likely that some countries may bring in
financial incentives for operators to buy these 'cleaner' trucks in 1998 or
earlier.
Thus there is likely to be a repeat of the Euro II scenario, in which
companies such as Iveco-Ford with its Eurostar truck range and Volvo with
its latest FH ranges, launched Euro II-compliant trucks well in advance of
the formal introduction of new emissions standards.
The other main area of legislation, noise, is proving rather more
problematical.
Another EU directive is to go into effect on October 1 next year requiring a
truck to emit a maximum of 80 decibels, measured by roadside microphones,
when travelling at 50 kilometres per hour. The current maximum is 84
decibels, and although the reduction may not appear to be much, this is
around a halving of perceived noise.
To meet the standards manufacturers are seeking a number of remedies, such
as sound-deadening body panels, partial encapsulation of the engine and, as
Mr Armstrong puts it, 'exhaust systems like small dustbins'.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (10): Good times roll on
and on - North America, heavy trucks / Laurie Morse looks at the road ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The North American heavy truck industry is enjoying the biggest boom in its
history, with 1994 production headed toward a record 205,000 units, and new
order backlogs so vast that the good times for truck assemblers should roll
straight into September 1995.
Experts say the industry is enjoying the peak of its cycle, with orders,
tempered by rising interest rates, expected to taper off about 10 per cent
next year, and another 15 to 20 per cent in 1996.
In the meantime, truck makers and their suppliers are struggling to meet
demand. This is the sixth consecutive quarter that North American class 8
truck producers, led by Freightliner and Navistar, have operated at or above
full capacity.
Although the cyclical recovery had been widely predicted, the extent of the
surge caught producers by surprise, resulting in some production bottlenecks
and a scramble by the leading truck makers to reposition production and
labour to make the best possible use of available resources. Navistar, for
example, added more than 600 workers this spring to meet demand, despite a
long-term campaign to trim labour costs.
Most factories are working round the clock, and companies that make a
variety of truck lines are retooling to place heavy truck manufacturing at
their highest-capacity plants. Still, component shortages continue to
restrain output, pushing production schedules to meet order backlogs,
currently above 100,000 units, deep into 1995.
The situation is the first test of the American industry since the rigorous
rationalisation in the mid-1980s. At that time, when demand was in a trough,
North American truck production consolidated, with subsequent capacity
reductions by truckmakers and their suppliers. Freightliner was purchased by
Daimler-Benz during that period, while Mack Trucks became a property of
Renault. International Harvester became Navistar, and sold off more than
half of its businesses.
Since truck makers are essentially 'screwdriver' companies that assemble
components made by outside suppliers, the fates and capacities of truck and
component manufacturers are closely linked. Some of the biggest winners in
the gold rush are engine makers such as Cummins and Caterpillar and other
leading truck compponent makers such as Rockwell and Eaton.
Ironically, even with the industry at an historic peak, investors are not
bidding up truck industry shares. 'Most of these companies are heavily
discounted because of their cyclical nature, whether they deserve it or
not,' one analyst said.
'Many companies, including Cummins Engine, have worked hard to balance their
businesses, with cyclical industries representing less than half of their
sales.'
Stark's Off-Highway Ledger, a Chicago-based newsletter that tracks the truck
industry, reports North American heavy-duty truck makers are operating at
109 per cent of available capacity in the fourth quarter, manufacturing an
average of 842 trucks a day. That compares with 743 trucks a day in the
fourth quarter last year.
Of that total, the newsletter says Freightliner is assembling 214 units a
day and operating at 129 per cent of capacity, and Navistar, under its
International brand, is making 170 trucks a day with capacity at a strained
148 per cent. Mack, the third-largest North American heavy truck maker is
assembling 118 trucks a day and is operating at 107 per cent of capacity.
Seattle-based Paccar, which owns Kenworth and Peterbuilt, is North America's
other big heavy truck producer. Combined, Paccar's companies are assembling
an average of 157 heavy-duty trucks a day this quarter.
Industry leader Freightliner's sales are projected to be up 28 per cent this
year at Dollars 3.9bn.
Navistar's sales are also surging, at Dollars 5.3bn, but high operating
costs limited 1994 net income to just Dollars 82m.
David Healy, an auto and autoparts analyst with SG Warburg in New York, says
the heavy truck boom has hit with such gusto for more reasons than a
prolonged period of low interest rates and pent-up demand. 'Truck traffic is
very strong, and fleets of existing trucks are ageing,' he says, 'but even
newer trucks are being replaced. There has been such engine innovation
recently, in terms of environmental considerations and from the standpoint
of fuel use, that it makes it smart to replace to get lower operating
costs.'
He says that just-in-time inventory procedures adopted by a vast number of
US companies over the past decade have also boosted truck traffic. 'It seems
that what used to be kept in the warehouse is now kept rolling on trucks,'
he says.
In fact, the volume of heavy truck orders serves as a leading economic
indicator for some analysts. 'Truck volumes precede the economy by three to
six months,' says John Stark, editor of the Off-highway Ledger. 'Since heavy
trucks carry volumes of goods from one part of the country to another, they
reflect early changes in the economy.'
Truck company executives fear that if the US tightens interest rates any
further, it will lead to a flood of order cancellations late this year.
However, to date there has been little sign of order slowdowns.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (11): Barely making a go
of it - Profile, Navistar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE

<TEXT>
While most North American heavy truck manufacturers are hauling away big
profits this year, enjoying the biggest production surge in the industry's
history, Chicago-based Navistar is barely making a go of it, with its truck
and engine-making operations still mired under burdensome operating costs.
Once carrying the world-class nameplate of International Harvester, the
company changed its name to Navistar when the Harvester logo and its
agricultural equipment operations were sold to the JI Case division of
Tenneco in 1985 as part of a debt-reducing restructuring.
While still North America's top producer of medium trucks, and the number
two producer of heavy trucks and diesel engines, Navistar, one of the few
independent truck makers left in America, has teetered so long on the brink
of solvency that securities analysts still rate the company as a highly
speculative investment.
With its factories operating at nearly 110 per cent of capacity this year,
the company had net income of Dollars 82m on sales of Dollars 5.3bn. This
puny return on sales is an improvement over 1993's loss of Dollars 501m.
However, it pales next to industry competitors such as Freightliner, which
will earn twice the amount that Navistar will earn this year on a fraction
of the sales.
The sale of the International Harvester agricultural machinery division a
decade ago turned into an expensive long-term disaster for Navistar, which
retained pension and healthcare obligations for those who retired from the
spun-off unit.
At one point Navistar was supporting three retired persons for each one of
its active workers.
James Cotting, Navistar's chief executive, has spent his 15-year tenure at
the company keeping bankruptcy at bay, gradually reducing Dollars 4bn in
debt and last year landing a union agreement that allows the company to swap
some of its pension obligations for equity.
The deal, which was credited with salvaging the company's future, tripled
the number of Navistar shares outstanding, a dilution that dulled any
budding enthusiasm for the company on Wall Street.
With business conditions strong, and the immediate crisis past, Mr Cotting
announced in October that he would be handing the baton over to John Horne,
currently Navistar's president, in March. A life-long Navistar employee, Mr
Horne is an engineer by training and is steeped in Navistar's operating
side, in contrast to Mr Cotting's financial focus and background.
Mr Horne will be charged with managing a high-cost producer in an industry
facing an imminent downturn, says John Stark, the editor of the
Chicago-based Off-Highway Ledger and a veteran observer of the US truck
industry. 'The question of the moment is how he is going to cope with the
drop in demand for Navistar's products that will begin next year.'
The general outlook is for US heavy truck demand to drop off 10 per cent in
1995 from this year's peak, and experience an even bigger decline in 1996.
'He has about one year to plan for the cyclical downturn,' Mr Stark says.
He suggests Mr Horne will search for a 'white knight' to save the company
from another crisis, although, he says, 'they still have such a heavy debt
load that few people will be interested. He may be forced to go it alone.'
Mr Horne declined to talk about his plans for the company.
Although most cyclical businesses bank profits in a highly profitable year
to cushion the lean times, Navistar, unlike its competitors, is not making
extraordinary profits this year, and so has less to take to the bank.
This will hurt doubly next year, as Ford introduces its new line of heavy
trucks, and other competitors launch new products to challenge Navistar's
medium truck line.
Many of Navistar's troubles stem from having to service debt far above
industry averages.
In an effort to cut costs, the company for the past three years has focused
on negotiating lower-cost single-supplier agreements for its heavy truck
components.
In a flat or declining market, being tied to one supplier can be economical.
However, in highly profitable times, having a single supplier for critical
components can lead to shortages and production bottlenecks, both problems
suffered by Navistar this year.
The single-supplier problem is less noticeable at Navistar's diesel engine
production operations, where Mr Horne has moulded the most successful of the
company's divisions.
Lack of capital has also blocked the company's obvious need to diversify to
temper the cyclical effects of its business, and has forced the company to
defer much-needed manufacturing improvements.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of Slovakia (11): Asia fills the sales vacuum - Steel
exporter replaces its old Soviet market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When communist central planners decided to build an integrated steel plant
in eastern Slovakia 30 years ago they chose a site more than 1,000km. from
its future iron supply in the Ukraine and more than 500km. from the Ostrava
coal basin in the Czech republic.
These logistical fundamentals, typical of Soviet-style central planning,
remain in force. But the East Slovakian steel complex, VSZ, no longer sends
a large part of its output to customers in the former Soviet Union.
Instead it sells nearly 30 per cent of its steel coils and sheets to far
eastern markets such as Thailand and China, although the biggest share of
output is still absorbed by the industries of close neighbours in the Czech
Republic, Hungary and Poland.
The company, which employs more than 25,000 people, dominates the economy of
eastern Slovakia and the steel maker, together with a host of privatised
spin-off service and manufacturing companies, is by far the largest employer
and source of finance for Kosice, the regional capital.
Throughout the world-wide recession VSZ managed to trade profitably, aided
by relatively low input and wage costs. Now that the recession has lifted,
however, profits are rising fast while costs remain constrained by low local
wage levels, higher productivity and still relatively cheap raw materials.
Mr Peter Hrinko, who took over as chairman last December after a purge of
the former management headed by Mr Zoltan Berghauer, says that profits this
year are expected to triple to more than SKK1bn in 1995. The 1993 accounts
show net profits of SKK490m, although this falls to SKK190m if calculated by
conventional western accounting methods, according to Mr Hrinko.
Over the last two years, the company has been privatised. However, the
National Property Fund remains the largest single shareholder, with 37.6 per
cent of the 16.4m shares whose total capitalisation, according to
calculations by Daiwa Research, was SKK5.54bn in November 1994. This makes
VSZ the second largest Slovak company, after Slovnaft, the petro-chemical
and refining group, accounting for 10.9 per cent of the total capitalisation
of shares quoted on the Bratislava stock exchange.
The remainder of the shares are distributed among Slovak investment funds
who hold 22.8 per cent, Czech Investment funds, who hold 9.9 per cent, and
more than 600,000 small investors who mainly bought their shares through the
coupon privatisation scheme.
In preparation for privatisation VSZ was re-organised as a holding company
and many operations were hived off to separate companies. As so often in
former communist Europe, the combination of re-organisation and
privatisation was clouded by allegations of profiteering, theft of state
property and political interference.
A supervisory board was set up to oversee the newly privatised entity. It is
headed by Mr Julius Toth, finance minister in the post-independence Meciar
government and a former finance director of the old state-owned company.
Last December top managers who oversaw the hiving off and privatisation of
both suppliers and sales companies were dismissed, following allegations
that companies at both ends of the parent steel company had been making
profits which rightly belonged to the parent company.
A new sales company, VSZ SOZ, was set up to oversee export sales which make
up 80 per cent of the VSZ group revenues. It tightened financial discipline
and payment terms as well as negotiations with potential foreign investors.
The new management team and supervisory board have a substantial financial
stake in the success of VSZ, which partly explains the drive to re-direct
revenue streams back to the core of the group.
Throughout the recession VSZ continued to invest in raising the quality of
its hot and cold rolled coils and sheets and building new export markets.
Major cost savings have come from replacing an energy-intensive slabbing
mill by modern continuous casting equipment. Last year, the company became
the first former Comecon steel producer to become a member of the
International Iron and Steel Institute. It has also won quality awards which
put it on a par with the best of European producers. The combination of
higher prices and strong export-led demand are factors behind Slovakia's
rising foreign currency reserves and the new-found stability of the Slovak
crown.
The decision to diversify export markets, which was partly forced upon the
company by protectionism in west European markets, has helped to strengthen
the company's overall position.
The ability of West European producers to sabotage the European Commission's
plan to cut surplus capacity in the current EU countries does not worry the
managers of VSZ. For although surplus capacity lies behind the quota
restrictions and anti-dumping levies imposed against eastern Europe and
other low-cost producers VSZ only sold 15 per cent of its output, or 503,000
tonnes, to EU markets in 1993.
According to Mr Vladimir Balanik, vice president in charge of sales, sales
into western Europe are more profitable than into more distant and
competitive markets. But the company has no intention of trying to sell more
into western Europe, although it is anxious to ensure that its existing
sales to neighbouring Austria and the other new EU entrant Scandinavian
states are not cut by new quota and other restrictions.
'Even without quotas we would not increase our sales to existing EU markets
in 1995 because we want to preserve a good long term relationship with EU
customers and keep our share of other markets too,' Mr Hrinko adds. But the
desire not to antagonise the EU also reflects the desire to keep good
relations with the leading steel producers in Western Europe. Some, such as
Hoogovens of Holland and British Steel, have already helped provide the
know-how and equipment needed for modernisation and the down stream move
into high value added coated products such as galvanised sheets and coils
and tinned coils for the canning industry.
Meanwhile the acceptance of 'voluntary' restraint in the west European
market has led to determined efforts to retain traditional markets in
central Europe. Sales to the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and former
Yugoslavia last year amounted to 1.27m tonnes, 39 per cent of total exports
of 3.29m tonnes.
The Czech Republic, which counted as part of the domestic market before the
demise of Czechoslovakia, is the biggest single market. But the greatest
success has been been in Asia, especially Thailand and China, which
accounted for 26 per cent of total sales last year. The Middle East absorbed
a further seven per cent while sales to the former Soviet Union accounted
for a mere two per cent, underlining the change in Slovakia's export trade
in the five years since the collapse of the Soviet bloc.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of Slovakia (12): Ukrainian supply line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 90 per cent of the iron ore fed into the blast furnaces of the VSZ
steel works in Kosice is transported nearly 1,100km. along the broad,
Russian-gauge railway which connects the plant with Krivoi Rog in the
eastern Ukraine.
After decades of open-cast mining, the once enormous iron deposit at Krivoi
Rog has been turned into a gigantic pit more than 1km. deep.
Ancient electric locomotives laboriously pull laden wagons up the crumbling
sides of the mine while equally ancient pelletising plants churn out
enriched iron pellets in factories of Dickensian squalor.
The future, if there is one, lies in completion of a new pelletisation
complex at Dolinskaya, 15km. from Krivoi Rog. Planned as a joint
Comecon-wide co-operative venture, Dolinskaya has been on hold since the
east Germans departed two years ago. They left 95 per cent of their
contribution to the venture already completed.
But Bonn refused to throw more D-Marks at a venture whose economic viability
was probably shaky at the outset and became more so as the date for
completion receded into an uncertain distance.
Ukraine badly wants Dolinskaya to be completed. The new plant was planned to
process the millions of tonnes of relatively low grade ore piled up in waste
tips around the city of Krivoi Rog. It would also allow the obsolete and
heavily polluting existing pelletisation plants to be closed down.
But the Slovak and Romanian steel industries also have an interest in
securing future supplies of relatively cheap Ukrainian pellets to keep their
own steel industries fed into the next century.
The alternatives of Brazilian, South African or Swedish pellets are all more
expensive and less reliable than the long term supply contracts promised by
Ukraine if only the project can be completed. Having come to this conclusion
the Slovak government last year signed a new agreement with Ukraine under
which VSZ and other Slovak companies will help to complete Dolinskaya in
return for guaranteed supplies of 17m tonnes of pellets over the first 10
years of the new plant's life and the prospect of more supplies thereafter.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of Slovakia (10): Austerity begins to pay dividends -
Heavy industries enjoy happier days as the tide of recovery starts to flow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Slovakia's smokestack industries were in the doldrums when the country
became independent two years ago. But many are now experiencing a rapid and
profitable revival on the back of rising world demand for steel, chemicals
and other basic industrial products.
As a result this year has seen a remarkable turnaround in the country's
financial health from a state of near crisis during Mr Vladimir Meciar's
first year as prime minister.
The outgoing government led by Mr Jozef Moravcik came to power last March
with a commitment to restart privatisation and cut public expenditure.
The austerity policies were painful but are beginning to pay dividends.
Inflation this year should be well within the target range of 10 to 13 per
cent set by the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS), and is expected to finish
the year at the lower end of the range. This compares with 25.1 per cent
last year when prices were boosted by the introduction of Value Added Tax
and the costs of setting up the new state.
Above all, growth has resumed. Gross domestic product rose by 4.4 per cent
in the first half of 1994 and by 3.7 per cent in the third quarter, from the
deeply depressed levels of a a year ago, and should increase by three per
cent for the year as a whole.
This is the first sign of growth after a 32 per cent decline in GDP over the
previous four years. The decline was exacerbated by the divorce from the
Czechs in January 1993 but was mainly due to the collapse of the Comecon
markets. This exposed the structural weaknesses of an economy orientated
towards steel, chemicals, arms and other heavy engineering products as well
as cheap textiles and shoes for the Soviet market.
The clearest indication of recovering economic health can be seen in
Slovakia's soaring foreign reserves. Official reserves, including gold, have
surged from Dollars 470m at the end of 1993 to Dollars 2bn on November 9.
Total foreign reserves in the banking system on the same date amounted to
Dollars 3.4bn.
The reserves have grown much faster than expected. The IMF set a target of
Dollars 1.3bn for currency reserves, excluding gold, by the end of 1995. In
practice this component has already risen to Dollars 1.65bn, mainly due to
exports which rose 8.5 per cent over the first half of the year. Steel and
chemicals in particular are reaping the benefits of greater efficiency and a
global upturn in those sectors.
The recovery has been underpinned by three main factors: a tight monetary
policy imposed by an increasingly assertive NBS; International Monetary
Fund-inspired fiscal discipline; and recovery in the international economy.
Foreign investors remain cautious.
The new republic has received Dollars 408m in direct investment to date,
according to the Slovak national agency for foreign Investment and
development. Much of it is small scale investment from neighbouring Austria.
The big European multinationals such as Volkswagen, Siemens, Tetrapak and
Rhone-Poulenc are present, as is Whirlpool of the US. But investments are
still small.
Slovakia's overall financial standing was improved in July last year after
pressure on the currency forced a 10 per cent devaluation of the koruna on
July 10. On the next day Nomura Securities announced a Yen254bn (Dollars
250m) five year bond issue. In September this year Nomura reaffirmed its
confidence in the country's economic future when it bought a 29 per cent
stake in VUB Kupon, Slovakia's biggest investment fund.
Export-led growth started in the last quarter of 1993 and Mr Vladimir Masar,
governor of the NBS, believes that healthy economic growth should continue
in 1995. The incoming government is expected to be constrained by central
bank prudence and the conditions attached to IMF loans. Despite the rhetoric
of the general election, the reform process, and the mass privatisation
programme will continue. 'There is no choice,' Mr Masar says.
Much remains to be done by the incoming government, however. In particular,
a radical restructuring of the banking sector has not yet been implemented,
though Ms Brigita Schmognerova, deputy prime minister in charge of the
economy, says a lot of work has been done on it.
The plan aims to tackle the problem of inter-enterprise and
enterprise-to-bank debt. The former is estimated at around SKK90bn, an
enormous burden that mainly afflicts the huge state-owned concerns,
especially arms and machinery producers. But, says Ms Schmognerova, 'even
good enterprises can be in secondary insolvency' as a result of debtors'
inability to pay.
The plan also calls for removing the government from any supervisory role in
the sector, leaving it in the hands of the NBS. The capital market is
largely unregulated at present, with banks, pension funds, investment funds
and stock markets operating in a void.
The government and the NBS are acutely conscious of the danger of bank
failures, and have been warned by this year's collapse of three banks in the
Czech Republic. 'We haven't had any big problems yet, but it is only a
matter of time,' Ms Schmognerova says. 'I hope the new government
understands the necessity of building these institutions.'
The key to more growth next year is whether the new government continues
with the privatisation programme restarted by the outgoing administration.
Next year's budget is dependent on SKK18bn of revenues from the National
Property Fund, the body that administers privatisation. This money has been
earmarked for debt servicing. If it is not forthcoming the budget deficit
will be higher.
Mr Meciar's attitude to the new budget will hold the answers to some of the
questions being asked of his incoming government. Mr Moravcik says the draft
budget assumes GDP growth of 2 per cent 'at least' and inflation below 10
per cent. It also aims for a budget deficit of 2 per cent of GDP, and
unemployment of not more than 15 per cent (it is currently 14.5 per cent).
Those targets, he says, 'cannot be met without privatisation'. Mr Meciar may
be as aware of the need for a tight budget as Mr Moravcik but has so far not
committed his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and its allies in
parliament to supporting the planned budget.
Observers say this could be a ploy. Mr Meciar may well support the budget in
parliament, they say, and if things begin to go wrong during his
administration he can always blame 'somebody else's budget' for his
difficulties. Mr Moravcik says: 'what we have done could be undone, but
there is an element within HZDS that may not allow it.'
The next few weeks will show whether he is right.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (6): Mercedes move spurs
market realignment - Buses / Eric Gibbins looks at the rationalisation
taking place in the sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC GIBBINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fierce competition in European bus manufacture is leading to reorganisation
and rationalisation. As a result, the past 12 months have seen extensive
activity in this sector. The forecast, back in July, by Helmut Werner,
president and chief executive officer of Mercedes-Benz AG that a realignment
in the bus market was in prospect has since been proved correct. In fact,
Mercedes has had a hand in it.
Subject to European Commission approval under its cartel law, January 1,
1995, sees the start-up by Mercedes of a new company to control its bus and
coach operations. This move by the world leader in bus and coach manufacture
is arguably the most significant of the action plans of European bus
manufacturers to get their industry back on track.
In his July comment, Mr Werner said that the market had become so small that
adequate capacity utilisation was no longer ensured for all manufacturers.
Anyone trying to prevent the introduction of measures designed to safeguard
the industry's future refused to acknowledge reality. Mr Werner emphasised
that individual companies had for some time been unable to influence what
was happening in this market. The market's development in the foreseeable
future and the competitive situation could not be ignored.
Mr Werner disclosed that the new company would consist of Mercedes-Benz's
bus and coach activities in Mannheim and its operations in Turkey. It will
also include Kassbohrer, the family-owned bus and coach manufacturer, which
had then just been acquired by Mercedes. The aim, he said, was to form a
medium-sized company 'to improve customer proximity and efficiency in what
is a difficult market'.
The plan is for Kassbohrer (with its production sites in Ulm, Neu-Ulm and
Ligny in France) and the Mannheim plant of Mercedes to constitute the
industrial line of a future European bus company together with Mercedes-Benz
Turk, which also manufactures complete buses.
Once, the new company is in place, buses are to be distributed in a
dual-trademark strategy combining Kassbohrer and Mercedes-Benz, but keeping
the Kassbohrer trademark, Setra.
A fall-out from the Mercedes/Kassbohrer deal was the acquisition by Volvo
Bus of Kassbohrer's Danish body-building subsidiary, Aabenraa
Karosserifabrik, which builds bus bodies in aluminium mainly on Volvo
chassis.
The difficult times experienced by the bus industry in Europe came to a head
towards the end of 1993 when the United Bus Group in Holland filed for
creditor protection. The members of the group - DAF Bus, Den Oudsten and
Bova in Holland, DAB in Denmark, and Optare in the UK - were all affected by
this. However, management teams at Den Oudsten, Bova and DAF Bus quickly
made successful moves to buy out the Dutch companies with similar Danish and
British teams moving in at DAB and Optare.
DAB's stay with the management team was short-lived when Sweden's Scania Bus
Division acquired the Silkeborg-based company. Said Scania: 'DAB will
continue production of its current product range, which includes a low-floor
bus and a flexible, somewhat smaller service bus. Long-term, Scania's and
DAB's product ranges will be co-ordinated and replaced with a
jointly-developed bus range.'
The summer saw takeover fever. Apart from the Kassbohrer and DAB moves,
Sweden's Volvo announced its acquisition of Drogmoller, the German quality
coach bodybuilder, while Berkhof, the Dutch bodybuilder, announced the
purchase of the bus and coach operations of Belgium's Jonckheere Bus and
Coach. Volvo was already using Drogmoller to build bodies on its latest
coach for the German market - the B12/5000. This reflected a co-operative
deal between Volvo and Drogmoller involving product development and the
marketing of complete coaches.
The reason given for the purchase by Berkhof of Jonckheere was that the
Jonckheere family, the existing shareholder, wanted to involve itself more
in other Jonckheere companies. Berkhof pointed out that survival had been
increasingly difficult for small bus construction companies. It predicted
more and more amalgamations. As a result of the acquisition, the new group
has a yearly production capacity of about 1,000 large buses.
The takeovers have meant the loss of some joint ventures. A notable
casualty, for example, has been the deal, struck just 12 months ago, between
Iveco and Kassbohrer to design, produce and sell new 12m and 10m city bus
and articulated bus ranges. These were to be introduced at Iveco's Valley
Ufite plant in Italy and at Kassbohrer's plant at Ligny in France.
One joint development programme that has survived is that between Volvo and
Renault at the Heuliez Bus company in France in which both the Swedish and
French companies each continue to hold a substantial (37.5 per cent)
interest.
There are, too, some companies that are beating the European bus recession.
The most notable concerns a British company, Dennis Specialist Vehicles of
Guildford. This long-established bus builder (1995 is its centenary year) is
recording record sales - more than 1,100 buses will be built this year
(1994) and next year the target is 1,400. This does not include several
hundred bus kits for export.
With traditional western European markets proving weak, the main bus
manufacturers have continued to look east. Scania has just announced that it
has started co-operating with a Russian consortium to build bodies and
market buses in Russia, using chassis from Sweden. RussScan is the name of
the company involved.
This Scania move followed an earlier agreement in Riga, Latvia, for Scania
bus assembly by AutoSkan, Scania's Latvian importer. This development
occurred at the same time as a deal by Volvo Bus with a company called Sokol
in Ekaterinburg (Sverdlovsk) to build some 300 Volvo-based buses a year in
that locality.
Another company to develop in eastern Europe is the German bus builder,
Neoplan. A letter of intent was signed in the summer with Russian interests
for Neoplan 15m buses to be built under licence and operated in Moscow.
This joint venture involves Autobus Zil and the Moscow Committee for the
Management of State Property. Buses will initially be built at Neoplan's
Pilsting plant in Germany by a team from Zil. Manufacture will later be
shifted to Moscow, mainly using components supplied from Germany. The
long-term aim is for Zil to build 1,000 Neoplan buses a year.
Neoplan also started building coaches in Hungary early in the year providing
competition for the main domestic manufacturer, Ikarus, which itself has
been heavily involved with western component manufacturers, including
Detroit Diesel, Perkins, DAF components, and Cummins on the supply of
engines. Renault VI is the latest to become active in this sector with the
supply of power units to the LVOV bus plant in the Ukraine.
Renault VI's biggest involvement in eastern Europe is in the Czech Republic
where this year it has been integrating its product into vehicles of Czech
bus maker, Karosa, which the French company partly owns.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (7): Many barriers swept
away - Transport deregulation in the European Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The liberalisation of the European road haulage industry has made great
strides in recent years. Many of the barriers in what was once one of the
most highly regulated sectors have been swept away.
A progress report to the European Commission on the deregulation programme
published in July concluded that for the most part the liberalisation
process was producing benefits for the continent's economy.
'Given the importance of road haulage to the success of the economy . . .
the sector must continue to operate in as competitive a manner as possible,'
the 10-strong committee of inquiry said.
Where problems had arisen, the committee noted, they were attributable to
adverse economic conditions and the difficulties caused by the transition to
a freer transport climate,
These conclusions came as a relief to organisations such as the UK's Freight
Transport Association (FTA), representing 12,000 companies which make use of
road haulage as well as the hauliers themselves.
'The report tended to confirm that liberalisation was a good thing,' said
Chris Welsh, the FTA's Brussels representative. 'It confounded the critics
who were claiming there was a crisis in road transport.'
But there has been considerable change in the shape of the industry. In
countries where previously highly-controlled markets have been deregulated
the number of hauliers has increased sharply. In France, the number of
companies rose by 28 per cent between deregulation in 1986 and 1990 while in
Ireland the number of operators quadrupled in the seven years to 1993.
In countries with long-established liberal haulage regimes such as Belgium,
the UK and Sweden the number of operators has remained stable, the progress
report said.
In all markets small businesses continue to predominate, though a relatively
small number of the most active operators usually accounts for a
disproportionate market share.
In the UK, for example, 10 per cent of hauliers operate 60 per cent of the
vehicle fleet.
Two areas were highlighted by the committee as being of particular concern,
the need for 'a framework of harmonised standards to ensure fair
competition' and a stricter enforcement of the standards which already
exist. 'Unauthorised and illegal operations are a major distortion for the
market and need to be addressed urgently,' the report said.
The committee saw the greatest need for further harmonisation in the area of
qualifications for entering the transport profession, taxes and other
charges and working conditions.
This struck a chord with the Road Haulage Association, representing 10,000
UK hauliers.
It has long taken the view that 'the single European market in haulage was
failing to adjust quickly enough and uniformly to the liberalisation
enshrined in the Treaty of Rome'.
The inquiry committee called for a study to be made of the training methods
and professional examinations in use throughout the European Union.
It called for the establishment of a union-wide organisation to see that
standards were met. Training should include subjects such as information
technology, financial management and safety, it said.
It also called for a uniform standard to be set for the financial standing
of haulage businesses. Present diverse levels in use throughout the union
should be increased until they reach a uniform standard, the committee said.
This particular proposal was less acceptable to organisations such as the
FTA in a UK climate where government has attempted to reduce the amount of
red tape burdening business.
'We are concerned that people would pick up the negative points of the
report which refer to access to the professions,' said Mr Welsh. 'We argue
that we have adequate standards in Europe.'
But there is strong British support for the idea of greater harmonisation on
the level of charges imposed on transport businesses.
Haulage operators travelling to or through Belgium, Denmark, the
Netherlands, Germany and Luxembourg will have to pay a Pounds 1,000 annual
motorway tax per vehicle from next year.
Although operators based in these countries will also have to pay these
charges they are expected to receive a rebate on their vehicle excise duty
to compensate. Rebates have already been agreed for German and Danish
hauliers and are proposed in the other countries.
There will be no corresponding charge made by other EU member countries
although France, Spain and Italy already charge tolls on their motorways.
The result will be that British hauliers will pay for motorway use in most
EU countries while non-UK operators will have the free use of Britain's
roads.
On the subject of enforcement the committee of inquiry called for urgent
action. 'Lack of enforcement . . . is perhaps the single greatest problem
facing the (transport) sector,' it said.
It called for the application of information technology to produce documents
which are better protected against fraud and abuse; the sharing of
information between different regulatory organisations and countries; and
the more efficient monitoring of vehicle and container movements and
drivers' hours.
On-board computers could be used to maintain both driver and vehicle records
while, in future, roadside controls should be replaced with automatic
roadside reading of on-board records.
The committee also made a controversial appeal for the impounding of
vehicles when there had been a serious infringement of the regulations.
Impounding is standard policy as a means of controlling unauthorised parking
in towns but it would be more problematic, and involve greater costs, if
applied to international commercial vehicle movements.
It also urged that shippers should be made jointly liable with hauliers for
any infringements of EU regulations. At present it is only in Ireland,
Germany and Spain that shippers can be made liable if they employ
unauthorised operators. The committee called for this to be extended
throughout the EU.
Joint liability would also help to overcome the problem of legitimate
hauliers who are picked up for carrying overweight containers or hazardous
goods. The haulier usually does not know precisely what is in a sealed
container and is at the mercy of an unscrupulous or unthinking shipper who
may have loaded unauthorised goods or changed the details of the shipment.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (8): Award marks a
turning point - Profile, Iveco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Fiat Group's Iveco commercial vehicles subsidiary, Maastricht is rather
more than the quiet Dutch city where the European Union treaty was signed 2
1/2 years ago. Although much less attention was paid to the Maastricht Bus
Show at the end of October, it was nevertheless an important event for Iveco
and for Europe's other bus and coachmakers.
At Maastricht, Iveco's EuroClass HD highdecker won the 1995 Coach of the
Year award. Giancarlo Boschetti, Iveco's managing director, said that the
bus sector was a core business of strategic importance to the company.
In spite of difficult market conditions over recent years, Iveco has
continued to invest in the bus sector, developing new vehicles and its plant
at Valle Ufita near Naples. The EuroClass HD, with its emphasis on safety,
use of non-corroding materials, low fuel consumption and conformity to tight
environmental standards, is a result of Iveco's commitment to the bus sector
Winning the award in Maastricht aptly winds up a year which has been a
turning point for the company. After a particularly bleak period, results
are at last improving. Announcing its half-year figures at the end of
September, Turin-based Fiat was able to point to Iveco's sales of 50,700
units, 13.7 per cent up on the figures for January to June 1993. Revenues in
lire were 17.6 per cent higher at L4,198bn.
Managers are confident that the company will break even this year. They
describe this as an enormous turnround. This is an understatement given that
Iveco, a Netherlands-registered company, recorded a loss of FL 592m (Dollars
339m) on sales of FL 8,437m last year. It was the second successive year of
falling revenues and third successive year of losses.
The company expected a difficult year, but it turned out to be worse than
anticipated. Indeed, Iveco was making losses at operating level, before
financial charges, during the first part of 1993. Cash flow for the year was
negative. At the year-end net financial indebtedness increased to FL 1,812m,
approaching the level reached in December 1984 at the end of the previous
recession.
It is a measure of the depths plumbed last year that Iveco's net sales were
only 1.6 per cent higher than those recorded in 1984, while losses were 49.9
per cent higher. 'The industry is feeling the effects of a pan-European
recession which has lasted longer and bitten more deeply than anyone ever
anticipated,' the company commented in its report earlier this year.
In its Italian home market, where more than one in two of new vehicles
exceeding 3.5 tonnes carries the Iveco badge and which absorbs more than one
third of the company's European sales, Iveco's volumes fell by a quarter
last year to 26,300 units. The company suffered steep declines in France
(down 18.5 per cent to 10,600 units), Germany (down 13.8 per cent to 13,200
units) and Spain (down 42.9 per cent to 5,100 units).
Only the UK relieved an otherwise awful European situation. Iveco was able
to benefit from the upturn in UK sales, beating the market's 7.8 per cent
improvement by increasing its volume by 22.4 per cent. Sales of 9,000 units
earned the company a 24.8 per cent share of the UK market for commercial
vehicles exceeding 3.5 tonnes.
Iveco's management notes that the company was particularly affected by the
recession because the market collapsed when its investment programme was
making heaviest demands. In its 1993 report, the company notes that the old
ranges have been phased out leading to 'complete renewal of the product
range'.
The EuroStar vehicles for long distance transport and EuroTrakker trucks for
heavy duty quarry and construction site work were introduced last year.
Earlier this year the EuroCargo range was joined by 4x4 vehicles for
off-road uses. Iveco's EuroCargo range of medium and medium-heavy 6-tonne to
18-tonne vehicles, launched in 1991, won the Truck of the Year award for
1992.
The company stamped its name on the European truck scene the following year
when it won the award again, the first constructor to win in successive
years. On this occasion the award went to its EuroTech 18-tonne to 26-tonne
medium-heavy to heavy range.
Research and development expenses reflect the efforts to renew the model
range. From 1988 to 1992, annual expenditure was between FL 470m and FL
560m. Last year, expenditure dropped to FL 363m, though the fall in sales
meant that research and development's share of revenues continued to be
above 4 per cent.
Investment in plant and equipment has also made significant demands on
Iveco's financial resources. When sales volumes and revenues peaked in 1989,
the company's gross new fixed investment was also peaking, the FL 1,000m
representing 8 per cent of net sales. Investment continued to weigh heavily
in the following three years, but fell to FL 352m (just over 4 per cent of
net sales) last year.
'The years of big spending designed to develop and to protect the business
are behind us. The level of investment in fixed assets has been falling
steadily since 1991 and has now been brought back into line with what was
spent on average in the years between 1983 and 1988,' the company noted
earlier this year.
Acquisitions are also a matter for the record rather than a strategy for the
future. Iveco undertook some important acquisitions between 1986 and 1992,
including Ford of Britain and Seddon Atkinson in the UK, and Enasa Pegaso in
Spain. Company managers say that no acquisitions are in sight, either short
or medium term, though joint ventures are likely to be a pillar for growth
outside Europe.
Parallel to its large investment programme, Iveco has been reorganising its
operations. Production costs have been cut and break-even points lowered.
Payroll has been slashed. Iveco had 41,300 employees on its books at
year-end 1991; the figure was 33,700 at the end of last year and is still
falling. White-collar and managerial staff have been most affected,
reorganisation trimming their numbers from 16,000 in 1989 to 10,000 last
year.
Lean and flexible are the watchwords. Rationalisation of internal procedures
has helped to reduce overheads, as well as pushing responsibility lower down
the hierarchy and encouraging workforce participation. At the same time, the
company has been examining how improvements to structures can help the
customer. A new figure, the field engineer, has been created, giving
customers a direct link to the factory.
Iveco believes that it is well placed to take advantage of the economic
upturn in Europe. The company is confident that its new models satisfy
market demands, while efficient manufacturing systems allow tight control
over production costs. Next year will not be easy, but managers forecast
that it will much better than 1994, and that Iveco will return to good
profitability.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of Slovakia (8): The voice of reassurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sergej Kozlik has the task of putting the best possible face on the HZDS and
its economic policies, writes ANTHONY ROBINSON.
He is anxious to reassure potential foreign investors worried at the
prospect of a HZDS-led coalition government supported by xenophobic
nationalists and a working class movement demanding higher pay and lower
unemployment.
'We simply cannot make concessions to the ZRS workers' association which
would lead to the loss of macro-economic stability and probably bring down
the government yet again,' he says. 'We are looking for compromises from
them which would ensure long term growth. We cannot allow wage increases
without higher productivity but we can and will reform the social security
system to focus benefits on the really needy,' he adds.
According to Mr Kozlik, the HZDS has three economic priorities: higher
public investment in highways; infrastructure and telecommunications;
stabilisation of the agricultural sector and encouragement of exports and
the entrepreneurial sector. For good measure, the HZDS policymaker adds
banking sector reform.
He does not include privatisation but it has been a point of contention
between the HZDS and the Moravcik government which cancelled some of the
sell-offs rushed through in the last days of the Meciar government but whose
own privatisation policies were bitterly criticised by Mr Meciar.
'In substance there are no real differences between the Moravcik government
and the HZDS over privatisation. The differences are in the detail. We do
not think that a majority of shares in companies should be distributed
through the voucher privatisation method, but at least 51 per cent of a
company should be in the hands of a clearly defined owner.'
He is also sceptical about the role of investment funds which now have
shares of 200 of the largest Slovak enterprises in their portfolios. 'Funds
may be good at managing portfolios but what we need are people who know how
to manage the enterprises,' he says. This is why the HZDS tends to favour
management and worker buyouts rather than the dispersion of ownership
through coupon privatisation and corporate governance in the hands of
investment funds, he adds.
He is quick to pledge that coupon privatisation will continue, given the
enthusiastic public response to the Moravcik government's launch of the
second round of mass privatisation through vouchers. But he insists that the
scale and volume of privatisation through the mass privatisation programme
will change with greater emphasis on trade sales and other more conventional
privatisation methods.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of Slovakia (7): Sausages and charisma - Meciar, the
old warhorse, triumphs again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the last weekend of September Slovak voters had the first chance to
register their verdict on the political record since independence.
When the general election votes were counted, Vladimir Meciar, who led
Slovakia into a divorce from the Czech republic in January 1993, re-emerged
as the dominant personality in Slovak politics. Once again Slovak voters
voted in large numbers for a charismatic leader whose style and personality
belongs more to the tub-thumping era of the past than the pragmatic, problem
solving approach of modern political parties.
His Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) won nearly 35 per cent of
votes cast and 61 seats in the 150 seat parliament, more than three times
the share of the vote gained by its nearest rival, the Party of the
Democratic Left (SLD), whose reformed communist leaders had hoped to emerge
as the new hegemonist political force in the country.
The vote was a personal triumph for Mr Meciar, who lost the premiership for
the second time after a parliamentary defeat in March, and a humiliating set
back for all his political enemies and rivals - including the president, Mr
Michal Kovac, and Mr Jozef Moravcik, prime minister of the coalition
government which replaced him in March.
Mr Moravcik, a former communist and academic who acted as the last foreign
minister of Czechoslovakia, earned Mr Meciar's implacable enmity by
defecting from the HZDS in 1993.
Encouraged behind the scenes by President Kovac, he helped to topple his
former leader in March and put together a broad based coalition. It ranged
from the reform communists of the SLD through to the christian democrats of
the KDH led by Mr Jan Carnogursky and included Mr Moravcik's own Democratic
Union, made up of dissident HZDS people and small liberal democratic
groupings.
The Moravcik government, which always saw itself as a stop-gap affair to
hold the reins before new elections, brought a new and more conciliatory
style to Slovak politics, raised the new republic's image abroad and
presided over a substantial recovery in the Slovak economy which began in
the fourth quarter of 1993.
However, the decision of the SLD, led by Mr Petr Weiss, to join forces with
catholics and liberal-democrats and help share the responsibility for
carrying through an IMF-approved economic policy of fiscal and monetary
austerity proved disastrous.
Instead of gaining respectability and votes by its participation in
government the SLD alienated its working class base who saw no reason to
vote for a party which shared responsibility for tight economic policies at
a time of declining real wages and high unemployment. They defected en masse
to the unashamedly 'workerist' Workers Union (ZRS) led by Jan Luptak and
Miroslav Kocnar.
A further 5.4 per cent of the electorate voted for the Slovak National Party
(SNS), the xenophobic, anti-Hungarian party led by Mr Jan Slota, the mayor
of the north Slovakian town of Zilina. Local wags call him 'Mr Zilinovsky',
a double pun on the town and the Russian nationalist firebrand Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky.
Mr Meciar spent six months fighting a no-holds barred electoral campaign
awash with beer and sausages and personal appearances in towns and villages
throughout his central Slovakian stronghold.
But he failed to win an overall majority and needs allies. He found them in
the SNS, which formally agreed to join a coalition, and the ZRS which backed
him in parliament and accepted positions in key parliamentary commissions
but declined formally to join a coalition government. Together the HZDS,
Nationalists and Workers mustered 83 seats, which gave them a working
majority but was still seven votes short of the 90 seats needed to unseat
the president and re-write the constitution.
Mr Meciar speaks of finding 'seven trusty men', like seven samurai, to give
him carte-blanche to forge a presidential system with himself at the head
rather than the parliamentary democracy outlined in the current
constitution. He also makes no secret of his desire to inflict personal
humiliation on President Kovac, another former HZDS supporter who defected
in frustration with Mr Meciar's domineering ways.
Mr Meciar's allies, such as Sergei Kozlik, the party's chief economic
spokesman, paint instead a more reassuring portrait of a rational, middle of
the road party.
He says the HZDS is fully committed to IMF-style macro-economic stability
but responds to the hopes and fears of ordinary Slovaks, especially those in
the bleak industrial towns of central Slovakia where the Soviet-era arms and
engineering plants are near to bankruptcy.
But Mr Meciar revealed a vindictive streak on the night of Thursday,
November 3, when the newly elected parliament reassembled. In a marathon
session lasting 23 hours Mr Meciar sat back and watched while his political
hatchet men and women proceeded with a purge of key office holders in
parliament and quasi-state institutions, including state radio and TV and
the privatisation agency as well as key parliamentary committees.
Mr Meciar also masterminded the setting up of a special committee to
investigate the circumstances which led to his own dismissal as prime
minister last March and passed a vote of no confidence in the privatisation
and interior minister of what at this stage was merely the caretaker
government.
Meciar allies dismiss protests as hypocritical and ask why foreign critics
in particular had not voiced similar outrage when Mr Vaclav Klaus, the
victorious Czech leader in the June 1992 elections, proceded to make a
similar clean sweep of his political opponents.
Diplomats privately reply that the difference is only superficially one of
style. In practice, the replacement of trained lawyers and other educated
office holders by poorly educated and politically untried nationalist or
workerist allies on such a scale and with such contempt shocked many
Slovaks, including opposition parties whose tacit complicity is required for
the political process to work smoothly.
Shortly after the event the German and French ambassadors called on
President Kovac to express the concern of the European Union at what is
locally known as 'bloody Thursday'. They were promptly accused of
impermissible interference in Slovakia's internal affairs by the redoubtable
Mr Slota.
But three weeks after 'bloody Thursday' voters had another opportunity to
register their views, at countrywide local elections. Mr Slota was
re-elected unopposed as mayor of Zilina.
But candidates closely associated with Mr Meciar and the HZDS performed much
worse than at the general elections. Mr Meciar may well form a new
government before Christmas. But his re-election has shocked his opponents,
forcing them to create a more effective and united opposition.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of Slovakia (9): Competition hurts - Miners hit rock
bottom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Anthony Robinson
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In communist times more than 8,000 workers were employed in the geologically
complex polymetallic ore mines around Roznava, a small town some 50km. west
of Kosice and close to the border with Hungary.
But the abolition of producer subsidies and the shift to world pricing
revealed the hopelessly uneconomic nature of most of the mines.
In a saga repeated in dozens of small towns throughout central and eastern
Slovakia thousands of miners have lost their jobs in an area of little
alternative employment as mines have been closed over the last four years or
production curtailed.
A similar fate still hangs over the Roznana mine near the town of Roznava
where the former siderite iron ore workings have already been closed and
uncertainty hangs over the potentially profitable polymetalic ore mine.
Production has already been suspended and its future will remain in doubt
until ways can be found of profitably treating a 50,000 tonne concentrated
ore stockpile and the rich ore body which still lies underground.
Two years ago Samax, the London-based parent of CMX Resources, established a
joint venture with Zelezorudne Bane, the state-owned company which runs the
Roznana mine. CMX, which was introduced to the mine while working with
Czechoslovak mining engineers in Tanzania four years ago, agreed to evaluate
the ores and seeks ways of eliminating the ecological hazards caused by the
stockpiles from which mercury had already been extracted.
But initial hopes that an Australian roasting process would solve the
problems of profitably separating the copper, silver, mercury, antimony,
arsenic and other metals proved vain.
Now CMX is experimenting with a hydro-metallic leaching process invented by
Sunshine Corporation of the US which 'could turn the mine into one of the
world's biggest producers of antimony along with 2m ounces of silver, and
smaller amounts of copper and other metals a year,' according to Mr Michael
Martineau, technical adviser to CMX on the project.
'We are fairly confident that the project will go ahead with an investment
of Dollars 10-Dollars 12m into what would be a long-life mine and treatment
facilities,' he adds. But such a decision hinges on the successful
completion of the leaching trials, and the price of antimony which is
currently at record levels.
Mr Vojtech Kral, managing director of Zelezorudne Bane, says 'we hoped that
events would move much faster, but our ores are very complex. Despite the
problems we have good co-operation with our UK partner,' he adds.
Mr Kral has successfully resisted former government plans to include the
mine in the voucher privatisation programme, arguing that it needs a real
owner who understands mining and is able to put in the capital required. He
and his management team would consider a management buy-out 'but only if the
price is one crown so that we could put new resources into developing the
mine', he says.
With bank interest rates between 18 and 22 per cent it would simply not be
possible to make the mine profitable if money had to be raised to buy
existing assets, he adds.
The only large scale mining still taking place in the Roznava area is at the
nearby Nizna Slana iron ore mine. Here 1,200 miners excavate 1m tonnes of
iron ore annually which is converted into around 450,000 tonnes of pellets
and shipped to the VSZ steel plant 40km. away.
Reserves are adequate for the next 10 to 15 years with sizeable further
deposits still to be confirmed.
The iron content of around 54 per cent is well below the 60-65 per cent
contained in the pellets which VSZ receives from Krivoi Rog in Ukraine and
costs are high because the mines are underground rather than opencast.
What keeps the mine in business is the cost difference between shipping ore
nearly 1,100km. by rail from Krivoi Rog and hauling it less than 50km. to
the steel plant which guarantees the livelihood of thousands of families
throughout eastern Slovakia and the survival of small towns such as Roznava.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (5): Minnow bucks trend
 -Profile, ERF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse of the UK's truck market in 1990 was the worst since the second
world war. Continental European markets suffered a similar collapse in 1992
and throughout last year. In these conditions, industry minnows such as ERF
are not supposed to be able to survive the savage discounting and other
market pressures exerted by the leading manufacturers.
ERF's production peaked at 4,319 in the 1989 surge and subsequently fell to
only half this level, from which it is still recovering.
Yet once again ERF and its chairman, Peter Foden, have come striding
relatively unscathed through the recessionary rubble, whereas the remains of
much larger DAF have had to be resurrected from receivership and another UK
truck-maker, AWD, has fallen subject to a takeover.
ERF, the UK's last publicly-quoted independent heavy truck maker, made a
profit of Pounds 453,000, after interest payments, in the second half of
last year. This was not sufficient to offset a first-half loss and for the
full year to April 2 there were pre-tax losses of Pounds 26,000. However,
this was still a significant improvement on the Pounds 4.12m loss of 1992.
'Margins are still pretty difficult but volumes are now rising and exports
outside Europe, particularly to south and west Africa, are looking up,'
according to Mr Foden. 'We are now making 15-16 trucks a week, compared with
10-ll at the start of the year.'
The claimed break-even level is 10-11 units a week.
'Five or 10 years ago, everyone was saying that by now ERF would have
disappeared or become just part of a big group. It hasn't happened because I
think we have a loyal UK market; the product has been well accepted after
being standardised around the Cummins (engine), Eaton (transmission) and
Rockwell (axle) drivelines; we have spent money on developing new products
and other improvements throughout the recession, and have a strong balance
sheet.'
There is an element, too, of 'keeping your head down and being a bit
stubborn', adds Mr Foden, a stocky figure with that blunt manner of speech
popularly considered archetypical of a northern entrepreneur. The business
has its headquarters in Sandbach, Cheshire.
The production increase has meant that, after a long period of retrenchment
which saw ERF's work force halved to 750, recruitment has begun again. About
150 jobs have been added this year.
With a slow but steady recovery continuing on the continent, Mr Foden
expects production to rise further, to 20-21 a week, over the next year or
so. However, this would still be well below the 30-a-week single-shift
capacity which has been created through a restructuring of operations for
greater efficiency. Cab production, for example, is now carried out at
separate facilities in nearby Middlewich.
During the past two years ERF has made its first substantive efforts to
establish a continental European sales and servicing network, starting with
France and Spain. It now has 18 French and eight Spanish distributors,
although the truck market recession in both countries has meant that sales
have been slow and ERF has yet even to launch on the Continent
left-hand-drive versions of its EC range, the development of which has
accounted for the largest portion of a Pounds 14m investment programme kept
up throughout the recession and during nearly four years of losses.
The EC trucks, covering the 15 tonnes-plus market sectors in which the
company specialises, will be launched in Europe next year, according to Mr
Foden. He maintains that as ERF's distribution network spreads throughout
the region, 'there is no reason why we should not capture around 2 per cent
of our sectors of the European truck market'. That would require extra
production of around 1,500 trucks a year.
The next countries in line are Portugal and the Benelux states.
ERF exports 15-20 per cent of its production by value. It has an assembly
plant in South Africa where the truck market is already benefiting from the
post-apartheid 'peace dividend'.
Despite an active leisure life which includes competing in his Aston Martin
racing car, Mr Foden says he has no intention of stepping back from the
chairman and chief executive's role in the foreseeable future.
'My excitement and satisfaction comes from being in the office and running
the business - it's much more fun than sitting on a bench in the sun all
day.'

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (3): Far-reaching global
expansion plan - Profile, Volvo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo, the Swedish car and truck maker, has faced testing times in the past
12 months since the collapse of its planned merger with Renault of France.
The group, the world's second largest heavy truck maker (above 15 tonnes
gross vehicle weight) behind Mercedes-Benz, has been developing a much more
aggressive strategy to expand its automotive operations and to divest
non-core operations as it prepares for an independent future.
The 45 per cent cross shareholdings with Renault Vehicules Industriels have
been dissolved, and Volvo has been working on plans to increase its share of
the world truck market alone, rather than in an alliance with the French
truck maker. Renault's 45 per cent holding in Volvo Truck was acquired for
FFr4.5bn late last month.
Volvo is now poised to embark on a far-reaching expansion of its truck
operations in Europe and Asia. The ambitious moves include the development
of a new range of trucks to allow it to enter the European light truck
market for the first time.
As a crucial part of this strategy it is planning:
To expand the capacity of its heavy truck operations in Europe by up to 20
per cent by mid-1996, with the investment of more than SKr1bn (Dollars
140m).
To develop a range of light trucks (7.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) to
allow it to challenge for the first time established rivals such as
Mercedes-Benz, Iveco, MAN, Renault and Daf in this segment of the European
market,
To establish a joint venture in China with the aim of adding a production
centre in Asia to its three existing regional truck manufacturing operations
in Europe and North and South America. It has also launched a feasibility
study into establishing production in India.
Volvo is leading the European truck industry's emergence from recession
helped by several factors including the weakness of the Swedish krona, the
successful launch of a new range of heavy trucks and its large share of
those European truck markets with the strongest growth such as the UK and
Scandinavia.
Production of its Volvo brand trucks, chiefly in Europe and in Brazil - it
currently sells under the WhiteGMC brand in North America - is running at an
annualised rate of 45,000 a year, an increase of more than 60 per cent from
fewer than 28,000 a year in the depth of the recession in mid-1993.
Volvo's share of the west European heavy truck market has jumped to 15.5 per
cent this year from 12.1 per cent in the whole of 1993, and the company's
truck operations are operating at the limit of their capacity in Europe.
It increased its deliveries of trucks by 38 per cent in the first nine
months this year to 49,400, and its order book for heavy and medium-heavy
duty trucks at the end of September was nearly double the level of a year
earlier.
The losses of 1992 and early 1993 have been overcome thanks to a combination
of tough restructuring and cost-cutting and a strong recovery in demand. The
truck division has closed one truck plant and one bus plant, has cut the
workforce by 19 per cent with the reduction of 4,700 jobs and has
concentrated its spare parts operations.
Volvo claims that new product development processes that are being put in
place will cut lead times from the 60 months for previous truck programmes
to an estimated 36 months in future.
In the first 9 months this year operating profits for Volvo Truck surged to
SKr2.697bn from only SKr183m in the corresponding period a year earlier.
Volvo is already investing SKr390m to raise truck capacity from 45,000 a
year to 50,000 (excluding North America) by July next year. The Volvo board
is expected to approve soon the investment of more than SKr1bn to raise
capacity further to between 55,000 and 60,000 a year by mid-1996.
Volvo's plan for entry into the European light truck market will also be
completed in coming months. It is expected to adopt a strategy of purchasing
the main components such as engines, gearboxes and axles from outside
suppliers, and negotiations on supply contracts are likely to begin in early
1995. Annual production capacity is expected to total well in excess of
10,000 a year.
According to Karl-Erling Trogen, president of Volvo Truck, Asia is Volvo's
'number one priority' in the geographic expansion of its truck operations.
It has launched a feasibility study with China National Heavy Truck and
Shandong Automotive for the establishment of joint ventures for the
production of trucks and components in Shandong province south-east of
Beijing.
Mr Trogen says that Volvo is waiting for approval from Beijing. Production
could rise to around 20,000 a year over six to seven years and Volvo is
'looking at the investment of billions of kronor'.
The group is also establishing a greater presence in east Europe with the
establishment of a small volume truck assembly plant in Poland. The
facility, which will be located in Wroclaw, will have a capacity to assemble
up to 1,000 heavy and medium-duty trucks a year.
The decision to establish a wholly-owned plant follows the failure of its
collaboration plans with Jelcz, the Polish truck maker, which had begun to
assemble Volvo trucks this year.
The Swedish group is moving equipment, tools and personnel from the Jelcz
facilities to its new plant in Wroclaw, where it is planning to produce more
than 700 trucks in 1995. It is the leading importer of heavy-duty trucks to
Poland and expects to deliver around 550 this year. It has established a new
marketing and finance company during 1994, and has a network of 10 dealers
selling exclusively Volvo vehicles.
Volvo is also seeking to expand its truck activities in North America and is
investing Dollars 200m in the next five years to modernise its US heavy
truck operations. It is building a new cab assembly plant and a high-volume
paint shop close to its existing truck assembly plant at Dublin, Virginia,
with operations due to begin in 1997.
Volvo's US heavy truck operation, Volvo GM Heavy Truck, is owned 87 per cent
by the Swedish group and 13 per cent by General Motors of the US. It has
sold its trucks hitherto under the WhiteGMC brand name, but this is to be
replaced by the Volvo brand name, as new products are introduced.
Production capacity at the Dublin truck assembly plant is to be increased by
20 per cent by the end of 1995 to 72 trucks a day from the present capacity
of 60 a day. The facility is being developed as Volvo GM Heavy Truck's
high-volume production operation in the US.
The cab assembly plant will have an initial capacity to produce 70 cabs a
day, but this will be increased later to 110 a day, and the Dublin facility
will also supply cabs to Volvo GM's other truck assembly plant at Orrville,
Ohio.
The investment in the US production facilities is part of the ambitious
modernisation of Volvo's heavy truck range, which began last year with the
launch of its new FH series of heavy trucks in Europe after a seven-year,
SKr6.5bn development programme.
The group is planning for the first time to integrate its US-built trucks
with its European-built products, and is aiming eventually to achieve as
much as 30-40 per cent commonality of components, excluding the driveline of
engine, gearbox and axles. Mr Trogen says that Volvo also plans to supply
around 25 per cent of its US trucks with its own engines in the next two to
three years compared with a current level of around 15 per cent.
Volvo GM Heavy Truck is in fourth place in the US market with a share of
around 12.3 per cent behind Mercedes-Benz (Freightliner) with 24.2 per cent,
and the US producers Paccar (22.3 per cent) and Navistar (18.9 per cent).

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (2): Industry looks
forward to significant growth - Europe, finally emerging from four years of
recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The west European truck industry is finally emerging from four years of
recession, although the recovery remains hesitant. Demand has picked up
strongly in markets such as those in the UK and Scandinavia, but these
increases have been offset by the continuing weakness of sales in Germany
and Italy.
The pattern of the recovery has led to a wide divergence in the performance
of individual European producers, with some groups such as Mercedes-Benz,
Iveco, and MAN still struggling to emerge from losses in Europe, while
others such as Volvo and Scania, the two Swedish truck makers, are already
experiencing a spectacular jump in profits.
Truck sales in western Europe (above 6 tonnes gross vehicle weight) began to
fall in 1990 from a peak of 296,000 in 1989, and the decline became
precipitous in 1993 with sales falling by 22.8 per cent to only 192,000,
according to the latest report by DRI/McGraw-Hill, the UK-based automotive
analysts.
During 1994, manufacturers have become increasingly confident that the worst
of the recession has been passed, however, and producers are now forecasting
several years of significant growth to the end of the 1990s.
According to the latest DRI World Truck Industry Forecast report truck sales
(above 6 tonnes) are expected to rise by 3.9 per cent this year to 199,000,
and demand is expected to strengthen in 1995 and 1996 with growth of around
10 per cent in both years. 'Most national markets have joined the recovery
process in Europe after the worst downturn on record,' says the DRI report.
Western European truck sales are forecast to rise further in the second half
of the 1990s to reach 272,000 by 1999, although this will still be below the
1989 peak.
The recovery has been led by the UK, which was also one of the first markets
to fall into recession. In 1992, UK truck sales fell to 31,398, the lowest
level since the mid-1950s, from a peak of 69,234 in 1989.
In the first 11 months this year UK truck sales (above 3.5 tonnes) have
jumped by 23 per cent, following an increase of 15.8 per cent in 1993, and
the industry is confident that this improvement will be sustained next year.
The sharpest contrast with the UK is provided by Germany, where sales
accelerated to a peak in 1991 in the wake of reunification - offsetting the
early onset of recession in markets such as the UK and France - only to
decline abruptly in the past three years.
DRI forecasts that the 'turning point could soon be reached' in Germany,
too, however. The decline in truck sales eased further in the third quarter
of 1994 with a year-on-year fall of 6 per cent, leaving sales in the first
nine months 10.1 per cent lower than in the corresponding period a year ago.
By contrast with the hesitant recovery in overall sales across western
Europe, truck production has recovered strongly with DRI forecasting a rise
of 18.1 per cent to 251,000 following the drop of 27.2 per cent last year.
Output was depressed last year by low demand and by excess stocks. By 1994,
the heavy constraint of surplus stocks had been removed, however, and truck
makers have also been gearing up to meet stronger levels of demand not only
in Europe but also in overseas markets, in particular in Latin America and
Asia.
Against this background the two Swedish truck makers, Volvo and Scania, have
benefited most with their competitiveness enhanced by the weakness of the
Swedish currency, as well as by the tough restructuring measures taken
during the recession.
Scania, the specialist heavy truck maker (16 tonnes and above), increased
its truck and bus sales worldwide in the first nine months by 28 per cent to
23,500 from 18,400 in the corresponding period a year earlier. The volume of
its order bookings rose by 61 per cent during the first nine months to
29,100 trucks and buses from 18,100, while operating income recovered to
SKr2.448bn from only SKr311m a year earlier.
A similar transformation has been achieved by Volvo Truck, where operating
profits in the first nine months surged to SKr2.697bn from only SKr183m a
year earlier.
Daf, the Dutch truck maker, which collapsed into receivership in early 1993
as the most notable victim of the recession, is also regaining some lost
ground, after its heavy truck operations in Holland and Belgium were rescued
by the Dutch and Flemish governments. In the first six months of this year
it achieved a net profit of Fl39.2m.
Since the rescue in March 1993 it has been able to increase its workforce
from 3,500 to 4,200 with production at its Eindhoven plant up by more than
half compared with 1993. It has recently taken on about 200 temporary
production staff at sites in the Netherlands and Belgium in response to
rising demand.
With the continuing weakness of the German market, Mercedes-Benz and MAN
Nutzfahrzeuge, the leading German truckmakers, have taken longer to emerge
from recession.
Mercedes-Benz's commercial vehicle operations are expected to suffer an
operating loss for a second year in succession in 1994, according to Bernd
Gottschalk, managing director of the group's commercial vehicle division.
However, he forecasts a return to profit in 1995.
MAN suffered a pre-tax loss of DM80m in its latest financial year to the end
of June, but the company is also forecasting a return to profit in the
current year. Its profitability has declined sharply during the past three
years with the 1993/94 loss following pre-tax profits of DM61m in 1992/93
and DM506m in 1991/92.
The company has restructured under the pressure of recession, and Rudolf
Rupprecht, chief executive, says the group has again been operating
profitably in recent months. It forecasts vehicle deliveries in the current
financial year will rise to 37,000-38,000 from 33,000 last year.
Despite the start of recovery this year Helmut Werner, Mercedes-Benz chief
executive, warned recently that the European truck industry was still facing
'enormous excess production capacity', which was likely to grow further due
to productivity increases. Current output of trucks (above 6 tonnes) was
using less than 60 per cent of the available capacity in the industry, he
said.
'The consequences are highly aggressive competition and a battle over prices
and conditions which continues to cause serious problems,' he said.
Part of Mercedes-Benz's response to this pressure is a plan to reduce
radically the share of in-house production in its commercial vehicle
operations, which is to be cut from 42 to 36 per cent.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (4): Putting on a brave
face - Profile, Renault Vehicules Industriels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jilted at the altar at the end of last year, Renault VI, the trucks and
buses arm of the French state-owned motor group, is putting a brave face on
life after its failed merger with Volvo. 'We lost a big opportunity, but we
remain very confident,' says a spokesman for the company.
Optimism is made easier by the rebound in the European truck market which is
pulling out of the severe recession of 1992 and 1993. But revival in the
market, which still remains well below its peaks of the late 1980s, may
mask, rather than resolve, the longer-term strategic challenges facing the
French group.
In the short term, the target is a return to profitability. After suffering
losses of FFr1.4bn in 1993, the company aims to report an operating profit
for 1994 and to move back into the black at the net level next year. The
revival is based on three factors, stronger sales in Europe, particularly in
France, continued strength in the US market where Renault VI is present
through its Mack subsidiary, and further cost-cutting and productivity
measures.
In France, the company expects sales of about 34,000 vehicles this year,
compared with 28,000 in 1993 and an average of about 40,000 over the past 20
years. For Europe as a whole, sales of trucks above five tonnes are expected
to reach 210,000 this year, compared with 203,000 in 1993. The upturn is
confirmed in the company's order books which saw a rise of more than 30 per
cent for Europe in the first nine months of the year.
Maintaining market share has, however, proved a struggle. In France for
example, Renault VI's share slipped slightly to about 42 per cent for the
January-September period, partly because of the price advantage gained by
its Swedish rivals as a result of devaluation last year.
In the US, Mack has steadily strengthened its performance. Acquired in 1990,
the company returned to profitability in February and is benefiting from a
vibrant market. Total sales in the US of Class 8 trucks, which are more than
15 tonnes and comprise Mack's principal products, should reach a record
level of 220,000 this year.
The turnaround at Mack is not just the result of a buoyant market. It also
reflects the benefits of restructuring measures which have seen the
workforce fall from 26,000 in 1987 to below 6,000 today. Similarly, the
number of employees in the company's European operations has been reduced
from about 35,000 to 20,000.
The cost-cutting and efficiency gains are aimed at enabling the company to
remain in profit through the next industry downturn. It is a tall order,
which requires further progress towards economies of scale in manufacturing
and the reduction of development cost.
Renault VI sees the solution in terms of an expansion of specific alliances,
rather than a grand merger a la Volvo. 'A big marriage would be very
difficult,' says a spokesman for the company, citing the lack of appropriate
partners. Iveco, for example, the trucks division of Fiat, is seen as too
similar. Both companies have a strong presence in southern European markets
and a virtually identical model range.
Some steps towards more modest partnerships have already been taken. In
July, Renault concluded an agreement with Iveco, under which the two
companies will co-operate in the manufacture and development of cabins. For
Renault VI the deal concerns its 3.5-tonne and 6-tonne Messenger vehicles.
With Volvo, a joint project to develop rear axles has survived the divorce.
Renault VI also sees scope for production economies within the group. In
particular, there are plans to develop co-operation with Mack in the
development of motors and, possibly, suspension and brake systems.
Are such measures enough? For Renault VI, the response is positive. 'We have
no handicap linked to our size,' says Shemaya Levy, who took over as
chairman at the beginning of the year.
Officials at the company point to the progress made in improving
profitability and the benefits of having a strong US presence. 'The US
market has now moved largely out of phase with the European market,' says a
company official. 'So there is a compensating, anti-cyclical effect which
smoothes earnings.'
As for the prospect that Renault VI could be spun off from the parent
company or that Mack could be sold, the answer is clearly negative. 'Mr
Schweitzer has emphasised that Renault VI is a core element of the group's
business,' the company says. 'Mack is an important element of our strategy.'
Some industry observers, however, remain guarded about the company's
post-Volvo prospects. 'It is still an open question whether Renault is big
enough to survive long term without some substantial partners,' says a motor
industry analyst at one Paris merchant bank. 'Volvo was the ideal solution,
in terms of product range and geographical spread and Renault will find it
that much harder to find the financial resources to revamp its model range
on its own.'

Nomura Securities, the Japanese investment house, has given a big boost to
foreign investor sentiment towards Slovakia with the purchase of a 29 per
cent stake in VUB Kupon, the country's biggest investment fund. Nomura payed
SKK2.18bn (Dollars 68m) for the stake in September, in one of the biggest
foreign investments in the country so far. The transaction was also the
largest ever recorded on the Bratislava stock exchange.
VUB Kupon is managed by VUB Invest, the fund management subsidiary of
Vseobecna Uverova Banka, Slovakia's largest commercial bank. It owns large
blocks of shares in many of the big companies in Slovakia and the Czech
Republic, and is currently heavily weighted towards the latter, with roughly
75 per cent of its portfolio currently represented by Czech assets, says Mr
Ladislav Vaskovic, managing director of VUB Invest.
Slovak fund managers are currently establishing new investment funds to
attract some of the 3.2m investors who have bought vouchers to participate
in the privatisation programme drafted by the outgoing government of prime
minister Mr Jozef Moravcik. Barring undue political delays, the final size
of the voucher programme is likely to be SKK60bn, and competition for the
investment points attached to vouchers is fierce.
Each voucher booklet, which can be bought for SKK1,000, is worth 1,000
investment points. Shares are allocated on the basis of demand.
Shares in companies considered attractive by investors will cost more points
than those of unattractive companies.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of Slovakia (6): Call of the Tatras - Anthony
Robinson takes the mountain tourist trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Czechoslovakia divorced into its constituent Czech and Slovak parts the
Czechs ended up with two thirds of the population and most of the viable
economic assets. But Slovakia ended up with the most beautiful parts of the
former federal state which in inter-war times extended even further east
into Trans-Carpathian Ruthenia.
Slovakia's jewel, and the focal point of its tourist industry, is the High
Tatra mountains, which separates Slovakia from Poland. Its snow-covered
central massif is less than 50km. long.
Immediately after the 'velvet divorce' the High Tatras lost their habitual
aficionados, mainly Czechs and Germans. But this year tourism in general,
but especially in the High Tatras, is showing a marked recovery.
Last year, (according to official statistics which understate the
contribution from the private sector) tourism earned only Dollars 314m from
16.3m visitors, This year, 14.4m visitors entered the country in the first
nine months alone and earnings for the first six months reached Dollars
268m. In the summer, Bratislava, the capital, received a steady flow of
weekend tourists from Austria and other countries, while hotels and guest
houses in the High Tatras report full bookings for Christmas and the New
Year.
The communist regime constructed a superhighway along the base of the
Tatras, which is fine for tour coaches but bad news for walkers. The old
regime also put up ugly concrete blocks masquerading as hotels. Fortunately,
however, there are also plenty of survivors from a more civilised age, such
as the splendid Grand Hotel at Stary Smokovec, and smaller, cheaper
establishments typified by the chalet-like Hotel Panda, also at Smokovec,
which provides a warm welcome, goose for dinner and simple comfortable rooms
for Dollars 25 a night all found.
Meanwhile, walkers and wanderers can ignore the super highway by opting for
the red trams which wind their way around the contours of the mountain and
through the pine forests.
But there is more to Slovakia than the High Tatras. Bratislava, or rather
its historic centre, is small and provincial compared with the glories of
Prague. It was further spoiled by the communists who demolished a medieval
synagogue and a network of cobbled streets and old town houses to build the
bridge which connects the old town with the high rise 1970s suburb of
prefabricated 'panelak' housing called Petrzalka across the fast-flowing
Danube.
Under the Habsburgs, when it was still called Pressburg, Bratislava was a
favourite place for weekend outings by the people of Vienna upstream. Under
its honest and capable mayor, Mr Peter Kresanek, it is now looking up again.
The mayor, a Christian democrat, was re-elected with a comfortable majority
at last month's local elections.
Privatisation, and the restitution of property to former owners, has led to
a reconstruction and re-furbishing boom which has restored the elegance of
medieval, gothic and baroque churches, public buildings and the cheap and
excellent opera and national theatres. Formerly neglected streets have been
transformed and new private shops, cafes and restaurants have created a new
vitality.
A small private hotel, the Perugia, has opened near the main square and the
post-war Devin Hotel remains friendly, good value and full of central
European atmosphere. The same cannot be said for its brash neighbour on the
river front, the French-owned Danube, which charges high prices for spartan
rooms, shoddy decor and the same terrible telephones as cheaper
establishments. The Forum Intercontinental remains the smartest hotel in
town, but it too is expensive, heavy on the marble and light on charm.
Between Bratislava, at the south western tip of the country, and Kosice,
500km. east of the capital and 100km. from the Ukrainian border, lies a
string of small towns and industrial villages along the Vah valley. An
alternative route takes one through the folds of the low Tatra mountains,
actually a succession of wooded hills and occasional rocky outcrops, often
crowned with spectacular ruined castles.
Before the war the towns and villages must have been harmonious little
jewels. Their centres usually still are. But all too frequently the
communists surrounded the historic centres with uniformly ugly glass and
cement housing estates in defiance of all the rules of aesthetics or the
logic of natural contours.
Visitors to Kosice, the capital of eastern Slovakia, are often depressed by
the endless industrialised suburbs on the outskirts, only to be delighted by
the glorious gothic pile of St Elisabeth's cathedral, the restored 19th
century theatre and the strongly Hungarian-influenced architectural style of
the old city.
Kosice's churches, with services in Slovak and Hungarian, synagogues and
fine houses reflect the past ethnic complexity and cultural vitality of a
city striving to revive its past glories. One of the three synagogues is
still functioning, although plaques on the two largest recall how thousands
of Jews were rounded up and sent to their deaths when Kosice was returned to
Hungary by Hitler and the rest of Slovakia was ruled as a Nazi puppet state
headed by a renegade Catholic priest, Father Jozef Tiso.
Scattered throughout Slovakia are remnants of earlier settlements of
Swabians, Hungarians, Ukrainians, Jews, Ruthenians, Gypsies and others.
Beyond Kosice lies Ruthenia, although most of Trans-Carpathian Ruthenia was
annexed by Stalin after the war and now lies in Ukraine.
In general, the further east one goes the poorer the people, but the more
intact are the old villages and towns, like Bardejov, and many other
reminders of a rural past which was shaken up but not entirely destroyed
during the communist years.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of Slovakia (4): Never mind the politics - A second
round of privatisation is about to start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Differences over the policy and implementation of privatisation have been a
battleground between Mr Vladimir Meciar and his political opponents
throughout the brief life of the Slovak republic.
Whatever their political allegiances, however, more than 3.2m Slovaks,
roughly 60 per cent of the population, have shown their hand by buying the
books of coupons which they can exchange for shares in state companies.
Popular support for private ownership did not translate into political
support for the outgoing government as happened in the Czech republic two
years ago. But the voucher method chosen for Slovakia's second round of mass
privatisation is based on that pioneered by the former Czechoslovakia and
put into operation in both halves of the then federal state.
Though the outgoing government's original plan to privatise up to SKK80bn
worth of state companies through vouchers is likely to be diluted by the new
administration, investment fund managers remain confident that it will give
a substantial boost to the country's capital markets and further increase
the role of the private sector in the Slovak economy.
Ladislav Vaskovic, chairman of VUB Invest which manages Slovakia's biggest
investment fund, VUB Kupon, describes the response to the voucher
privatisation programme as 'the biggest mandate of all'. It is a clear sign
that Slovaks are in favour of voucher privatisation, he says, and should
send a message to the incoming administration of Vladimir Meciar not to
tamper with it, as he has threatened.
If even a watered-down version of voucher privatisation is completed it will
give a substantial boost to Slovakia's capital markets. Investment fund
managers say the final size of the voucher privatisation programme should be
SKK60bn.
This is lower than the Moravcik government's target because the original
proposals included the profitable gas transmission and electricity
generation and transmission companies. Now, Sergei Kozlik, Mr Meciar's chief
economic adviser, says the energy sector has been designated a 'strategic
industry' in which the state will retain a majority shareholding.
There are already more than 500 companies quoted on the Bratislava stock
exchange as a result of the first wave of voucher privatisation which took
place when Slovakia was part of federal Czechoslovakia. Only 13 companies
are fully listed, but they include such key companies as Biotika, a
pharmaceutical group, Slovnaft, the refining and petrochemical giant, Nafta,
a gas supplier, and Vseobecna Uverova Banka (the General Credit Bank),
Slovakia's dominant commercial bank.
Stockbrokers say the bulk of trading activity is concentrated on about 50
stocks, which are liquid enough to allow for a true market in their shares.
Over 90 per cent of all trading is done outside the three official trading
systems, the stock exchange, the options exchange, and the RM-S, a computer
trading system that depends for its viability on dispersed shareholdings
resulting from voucher privatisation.
Trading is dominated by the big investment fund managers, which include
Harvard Capital and Consulting, CassoviaInvest and Creditanstalt as well as
VUB.
Share prices are currently in the doldrums, with the SAX index of
most-traded shares hovering around the 200 points level, compared to its
peak of 401 points last March. That rally was driven mainly by foreign
investment at a time when the Prague stock market was also booming, but a
subsequent pull-out by overseas investors caused both markets to collapse.
The Bratislava market's biggest problem is its chronic lack of liquidity.
Ironically, one of the causes of illiquidity is voucher privatisation, which
leaves investment funds with large portfolios of shares and little or no
cash.
Fund managers lament the lack of fixed interest stocks in the market, with
just four large bond issues quoted so far.
In common with other emerging markets, Slovakia's capital markets are also
beset with problems of transparency and lack of regulation. The outgoing
government has almost completed a major plan to supervise the banking and
financial sector, and there is a proposal to establish a regulatory body
along the lines of the US Securities and Exchange Commission to set rules
and ensure they are implemented.
Brigita Schmognerova, outgoing deputy prime minister in charge of the
economy, says the new body will be charged with supervising the banking,
pension fund and investment fund industries as well as the stock exchange.
The authorities' main aim is to prevent a banking collapse on the scale of
that of Banka Bohemia, a Czech bank that was shut down earlier this year
after it issued Dollars 1bn worth of fake securities abroad.
'We have not had any big problems so far but it is only a matter of time,'
Ms Schmognerova says. 'I hope the new government understands the necessity
of building such an institution.'
The outgoing government's plan also calls for the concentration of share
trading in a single market. Bratislava's three stock markets are an
expensive anachronism in such an underdeveloped market, and a fierce battle
for survival is currently being waged between the stock exchange, which is
owned by Slovakia's major banks, and the options exchange, which functions
as a spot market. Thomas Grey, principal investment officer at Slovak
International, an investment advisory group, says the stock market is 50
years behind the times.
Volume on the official markets rarely exceeds Dollars 150,000 daily, which
is less than 10 per cent of total trading. The rest is done directly among
brokers and market makers who bypass official channels because it is cheaper
and faster. Brokers favour the options exchange, where a one-day forward
contract helps set price levels in the over-the-counter market.
Juraj Siroky, president of Harvard Capital and Consulting (closely related
to the company of the same name in Prague), says the options exchange is
more tuned in to market trends and could already be the main trading
mechanism if it had not been refused a stock market licence by the finance
ministry. But the latter currently favours the existing stock exchange as
the centre of future trading.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (1): Worst is over for
the global truck makers - After four years of recession, demand for
commercial vehicles is beginning to rise in Europe and Japan. Kevin Done
examines prospects for the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE

<TEXT>
The world truck industry is no place for the faint-hearted, as markets
plunge through exaggerated cycles of feast and famine.
Four years of recession in western Europe had pushed most of the region's
truck makers into loss by last year with one leading producer collapsing
into receivership. Now the European industry's fortunes are again on the
mend, but already truck makers at the forefront of the recovery are
straining against the limits of their production capacity, as demand rises
more steeply than expected in markets such as the UK and Scandinavia.
In North America, heavy truck makers lost more than a third of their market
between 1988 and 1991. In the past three years sales have surged back,
however, with demand almost doubling from 108,000 in 1991 to a forecast
level of more than 206,000 this year. Leading US producers such as Paccar
are achieving record profits.
In Japan, truck registrations fell for five years in succession from 1989 to
1993, but here, too, the worst of the recession appears to have passed.
Japanese domestic truck sales, exports and production have all begun to
recover in recent months.
Surviving such sharp fluctuations in demand exerts heavy pressures on the
truck makers, and their ranks have been thinned as each recession takes its
toll. In western Europe there were still 52 truck makers in operation in
1975. By 1984, the total had been reduced to 14 and by this year the number
had fallen to 11.
The outcome of the latest bout of restructuring in Europe remains unclear,
however. Daf, the Dutch commercial vehicle maker which took over Leyland,
the loss-making UK truck producer, in the second half of the 1980s, became
the most notable victim of the latest recession, when it collapsed into
receivership in early 1993.
The former Daf group's Dutch and Belgian heavy truck operations have been
re-established, however, thanks to a state-backed rescue package, and other
parts of the group in the UK have also emerged from receivership as
independent companies, albeit after severe restructuring.
The biggest change to the industry - in Europe and in the US - was heralded
by the planned merger of Volvo, already the world's second largest heavy
truck maker, with Renault, the French state-controlled automotive group.
Together they would have controlled around 26 per cent of the European heavy
truck market and 23 per cent of the US market through their respective
subsidiaries Volvo GM Heavy Truck and Mack.
The merger foundered, however, in the face of a revolt by Volvo shareholders
and senior management, which had fundamental concerns about the valuation of
the Swedish group and the holding of a 'golden share' by the French state.
The two companies have dissolved the 3 1/2 -year-old alliance and last month
completed the break-up of the 45 per cent cross shareholdings in their
respective truck and bus operations.
Both groups have been forced to develop alternative strategies to replace
the alliance, although Karl-Erling Trogen, president of Volvo Truck, insists
that 'the industrial idea behind the merger is still valid. I foresee the
need for different kinds of partnerships in the future to get economies of
scale in industrial production,' he says. 'The business approach has not
changed.'
The leading European truck makers dominate the world heavy truck market.
Mercedes-Benz of Germany, the world's largest truck and bus maker, and Volvo
both have substantial operations and market shares in Europe and in north
and south America, while Scania of Sweden is the market leader in Brazil as
well as the most profitable of the truck makers in Europe.
The European producers are now seeking to broaden their operations by
establishing a stronger presence in Asia, where the industry is still
dominated by the leading Japanese truck makers, Hino, Isuzu, Nissan Diesel
and Mitsubishi Motor.
Volvo is seeking to establish a joint venture in China with the aim of
adding a production centre in Asia to its three existing regional truck
manufacturing operations in Europe and north and south America. It has also
launched a feasibility study into establishing production in India.
According to Mr Trogen, Asia is Volvo's 'number one priority' for the
geographic expansion of its truck operations. It has entered a feasibility
study with China National Heavy Truck and Shandong Automotive for the
establishment of joint ventures for the production of both trucks and
components in Shandong province south-east of Beijing and is now awaiting
official approval for the project from the Chinese authorities.
Mercedes-Benz is negotiating two ambitious joint ventures in China for the
production of heavy trucks, and buses and coaches. It is conducting a
feasibility study with Yangzhou Motor Coach Manufacturing (YMC), the biggest
Chinese bus and coach producer, for the formation of a joint venture with
the target of producing up to 12,000 bus chassis and 6,000 large coaches a
year.
Global expansion is also causing other changes in strategic approach.
This year Mercedes-Benz started production in Indonesia of a new range of
light-duty trucks and buses. The project marks a drastic change in the
German group's approach to developing new vehicles for the global commercial
vehicle market, as it seeks to overcome the disadvantage of its high
domestic cost base.
The MB 700 range of light-duty trucks (7.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) has
been developed to meet Asian cost levels using a system of global sourcing
of components.
Engines for the vehicles will be assembled in Indonesia from components
produced by Mercedes-Benz's commercial vehicle subsidiary in Brazil.
Transmissions and front axles are to be supplied by Tata Engineering and
Locomotive (Telco) in India, while the rear axles will also come from India
from AAL, a licensee of Rockwell, the US automotive components supplier.
Brakes and shock absorbers will be supplied from India, propeller shafts
will be made by Spicer in the US, Mercedes-Benz Argentina will supply the
mechanical steering system, optional power steering will come from Koyo in
Japan, while cab parts will be supplied by Mercedes-Benz's Spanish
subsidiary.
'The supply of major components from a country with high wage levels like
Germany could not satisfy the cost target. New ways had to be found,' says
Klaus-Dieter Vohringer, Mercedes-Benz components production director.
'Commercial vehicle concepts in the Far East and Europe differ considerably,
not only in dimensions but more so in the cost structure. The market
requirements in Europe cause a cost situation that is unacceptable to
customers in south-east Asia.'
Such global initiatives promise gradually to remove the existing marked
regional distinctions in the world truck industry, which have tended
hitherto to limit the amount of global competition between regional product
concepts.
European and Japanese truck makers generally develop and produce their own
principal driveline components - engines, gearboxes and axles. In North
America, by contrast, the truck makers concentrate chiefly on assembly,
while engines, gearboxes and axles are bought in from component makers.
At the same time Japanese and Asian truck development has been influenced by
the geography and infrastructure of Japan. Shorter distances, lower average
speeds and lower gross vehicle weights mean that trucks are generally
smaller in Japan.
Such regional differences have so far prevented Japanese producers from
competing significantly in the European and North American heavy truck and
bus markets, and the US overseas presence is also limited.
The leading European producers have made the strongest efforts at overcoming
such regional hurdles, and Asia is the new target for global expansion.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of Slovakia (1): Lively two year-old at the
crossroads - Industry and the economy are advancing steadily. But Slovak
politics are increasingly polarised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After two years of independence the basic institutions of the new Slovak
state are in place and the economy is responding well to tough, IMF-imposed
monetary and fiscal policies. Rising exports are stimulating a recovery of
industrial growth and boosting reserves.
But this central European country of 5.3m people remains politically
polarised between a coalition of populist and nationalist forces, led by Mr
Vladimir Meciar, and a fragmented opposition of Christian democrats,
socialists and liberals.
Slovakia's aims remain the creation of a prosperous democracy and eventual
membership of an enlarged European Union alongside the other former
communist states of central Europe. But fulfilment of these aims remains
fraught with considerable uncertainty.
General elections over the last weekend of September re-affirmed Mr Meciar
and his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) as the dominant force in
Slovak politics. He won the assent of 35 per cent of voters, more than his
party's three main rivals combined. The result was a personal triumph for
this charismatic but unforgiving man, and a traumatic defeat for both
President Michal Kovac and Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik. Both are former
allies of Mr Meciar who defected from the HZDS and helped to orchestrate the
parliamentary revolt that toppled him and his government in March.
The new government put together by Mr Moravcik in the spring was a
broad-based 'historic compromise' of socialists, Christian democrats and
liberal democrats. It held together well, presented a sober, democratic
image to the outside world and restarted mass privatisation and other
stalled economic reforms. But hopes that the coalition parties would gain
electoral advantage from their good governance were dashed by the
electorate.
The Party of the Democratic Left (SLD), led by an intelligent and articulate
band of young former communists under Mr Peter Weiss, hoped to emerge as the
biggest single party from elections. Instead it suffered a haemorrhage of
support from frustrated workers and the unemployed and won only 10.4 per
cent of the vote.
The Christian democrats (KDH), led by Mr Jan Carnogursky, received 10.2 per
cent while the Democratic Union (DU), a collection of liberal democrats and
former HZDS dissidents led by Mr Moravcik, picked up 8.6 per cent. In total,
the coalition parties received 29.2 per cent of the votes and 50 seats in
the 150 seat parliament against the 35 per cent of votes and 61 seats gained
by the HZDS.
Mr Meciar's victory left him far short of the simple majority needed to
govern, and even further from the qualified majority of 90 seats needed to
satisfy his main ambition of changing the constitution of the state which he
did so much to bring into existence. His long term aim is to transform
Slovakia from a parliamentary into a presidential democracy, with himself as
president. It is a prospect which fills many Slovaks with alarm.
Mr Meciar's appeal, while not inconsiderable, is concentrated geographically
in the economically depressed hinterland of the Vah valley and central
Slovakia. Sociologically he is popular among the weaker, less educated
elements in Bratislava and Kosice, which have a tradition of ethnic
tolerance and intellectual independence. He, and his xenophobic nationalist
allies, the Slovak National Party, (SNS), are implacably opposed by the 10
per cent ethnic Hungarian minority whose votes up to now have been frozen in
the political ghetto of ethnic-Hungarian parties.
In the short term, Mr Meciar faces the task of forming a credible and
efficient government with his nationalist allies from the SNS and his
'workerist' partners from the new Workers Union. The latter won more than 7
per cent of the vote by articulating the demands of the low paid and
unemployed for more money and more jobs. These demands will be difficult to
reconcile with the IMF's prescription of balanced budgets and fiscal
restraint.
Longer term, the task facing the opposition is to forge a more united and
credible centre party out of the social democratic, liberal and Christian
democratic strands of Slovak political life, and to keep Mr Meciar within
the bounds of political behaviour that are required if Slovakia is
eventually to enter the EU alongside the Czech Republic.
Meanwhile, behind the Sturm und Drang of Slovak politics, a substantial
improvement is taking place in the macro-economic performance of the Slovak
economy, with substantial agreement between the main parties on the need to
continue taking the bitter medicine prescribed by the IMF.
The underlying structural weaknesses of the Slovak economy were revealed by
the loss of an estimated Dollars 700m a year subsidy from Prague on
independence in January 1993, and above all by the collapse of Comecon
markets and the end of the Cold War.
Attempts to restructure the big military factories concentrated in the Vah
valley and central Slovakia have had very limited results. New investment
and joint ventures with foreign companies to shift from producing tanks to
tractors, fork-lift trucks and construction machinery were all predicated on
a post-communist reconstruction boom in the former Soviet states which, thus
far, has failed to materialise. Unemployment in these areas remains very
high, between 25-40 per cent in some districts compared with the national
average of 14 per cent.
On the other hand, the private sector now accounts for more than 40 per cent
of GDP and is growing steadily. A revived mass privatisation programme seems
destined to survive the change of government, albeit with relatively minor
modifications.
Several of the biggest former state owned industries such as Slovnaft, the
refining and petrochemical complex, and VSZ, the biggest integrated steel
group, have been partly privatised and re-organised with substantial new
investment. Long-stalled projects, like the Slovalco aluminium smelter in
central Slovakia, are being revived with support from the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
The main need now is for an acceleration of institutional reforms of the
banking and finance sector and better management and new investment in the
enterprise and farming sectors. Meanwhile, strong demand for steel,
petrochemicals and other Slovak products in world markets has contributed to
an export boom which is raising industrial output and pouring hard currency
into the reserves which have more than quadrupled over the last 18 months to
around Dollars 3.4bn.
Tight central bank control of monetary policy and public spending cuts have
brought prices down to within sight of single digit inflation next year.
Lower inflation and rising reserves have reinforced the Slovak koruna, which
was devalued by 10 per cent in July 1993 in agreement with the IMF. Since
then the exchange rate has been stable.
Inflows of foreign investment, however, are just a trickle compared with
levels in the Czech Republic, Hungary or Poland. This is a direct result of
political instability. Slovakia needs to maintain its access to the
international capital markets to get financing for the massive job of
restructuring industry and developing the infrastructure.
The 3.2m people who have invested in the voucher privatisation programme
have effectively passed a vote of confidence in continued economic reform.
Mr Meciar is far too astute to miss that message, and it may yet have a
large bearing on his policies in government.
'Heed what he does, not what he says,' say some observers in Bratislava of
Mr Meciar, arguing that he is a different, more pragmatic animal in
government than his rhetoric at the hustings makes him appear. Many Slovaks
as well as potential foreign investors and political partners will be doing
just that.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of Slovakia (3): Frustration of a nation builder -
Interview, Mr Michal Kovac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When independent Slovakia was born in January last year Mr Michal Kovac
hoped to use the authority of his office as the country's first president to
build a new sense of statehood. But the political instability that gripped
the country almost from the start has left him little time for
nation-building.
'So far I have not succeeded,' he notes with a shrug, sitting on the edge of
a chair in his sparsely furnished office in the baroque former Bishop's
Palace where Napoleon and the Austrian Emperor signed a temporary peace
after the French triumph at the battle of Austerlitz.
The man who has been making life hard for Mr Kovac is his former colleague
and fellow-communist, Vladimir Meciar, who is about to return as prime
minister after being forced from office last March, with the president a key
player in his ousting.
Mr Kovac appears unfazed at the prospect of his arch-enemy returning at the
head of a new government, which is likely to be strongly populist,
nationalist, anti-Hungarian and anti-Michal Kovac in tone. Indeed, the
president is a little richer because of the result of the election at the
end of September.
He was the winner of a presidential office bet on the outcome, winning the
princely sum of SKK1,000 (Dollars 32) by predicting most closely the share
of the vote going to Mr Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) -
it won 35 per cent; Mr Kovac predicted 33 per cent.
Observers in Bratislava say Mr Kovac has learned quickly how to get his
opinion across within the constraints imposed by his position. Every
political party, he says, has the same value for him, and he can express
neither anxiety nor joy at a certain party's success or failure. Election
results, he says, express the democratic wish of the people, and 'I'm
obliged to respect that'.
But the the president now suspects that he and the office he holds are due
for renewed attack. Mr Meciar wants to establish a presidential form of
government in Slovakia, a move Mr Kovac thinks is dangerous. The roots of
democracy are not yet deep enough in Slovakia for such a system, he says,
warning of a subsequent misuse of personal power. 'I'm for a parliamentary
system, not a presidential one.'
In order to establish a presidential system Mr Meciar needs to muster 90
votes in the 150-member parliament to secure a change to the constitution.
As talks on forming a new government drag on without any immediate sign of
success the likelihood that the new prime minister will achieve his goal
recedes, though he has still not committed himself to ceasing his attacks on
Mr Kovac.
The president says that if a presidential system is established its success
will depend entirely on the personality of the holder. Does he think Mr
Meciar is a suitable candidate for such a position? 'I am not able to say,'
he comments diplomatically.
Would he be a candidate himself? 'I haven't decided yet.' Observers in
Bratislava say he almost certainly would run for office in such an event.
He would not object to a presidential system, he says, if the new
constitution that would result allowed for unfettered opposition politics
and independent radio and television and 'if other democratic functions were
allowed to function'.
But even without being president or even prime minister Mr Meciar has
already used the power stemming from a bare coalition majority to wrest
control of the media and other key state bodies such as the National
Property Fund, which prepares companies for privatisation.
Early in November, in a parliamentary session that has become known as
'Bloody Thursday', he organised a parliamentary coup which gives his
incoming government complete control of these bodies and gave an early
warning of the confrontational tone of his administration.
Though he appears remarkably self-confident for a man who has been publicly
vilified by his enemies for his role in removing Mr Meciar in the national
interest earlier this year, Mr Kovac is clearly disappointed that he has
been prevented from developing his original vision of a unifying presidency.
Mr Kovac was not widely known when he assumed office at the beginning of
last year. The man destined to become Slovakia's first president had been
Alexander Dubcek, the communist party leader whose Prague Spring reforms led
to the Warsaw Pact invasion in 1968. But he was killed in a car accident
just weeks before his country became independent on December 31, 1992.
Mr Kovac stepped into his shoes. But, both as a communist party official and
as chairman of the last Czechoslovak federal parliament after the velvet
revolution, he has spent a great deal of time in Prague, a suspicious past
for the more nationalistic of Slovak voters.
Asked whether he thought independence had changed him and his
fellow-Slovaks, Mr Kovac lamented that the old way of thinking, in which the
state promised to take care of everything, still predominated. It even
helped to ensure Mr Meciar's victory in the election. 'People still think
some bright new future will come out of that kind of thinking. But such a
thing does not exist any more,' he says.

FT  16 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Warburg hit as talks fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bull case for SG Warburg sagged yesterday as the merchant bank announced
that its merger talks with Morgan Stanley, of the US, had foundered.
The sticking point in the deal was Mercury Asset Management, Warburg's 75
per cent-owned fund management arm. Morgan Stanley said Mercury shareholders
demanded too high a price and it was not prepared to take Warburg on its
own.
Many analysts were still looking confidently towards the next stage. They
believe Warburg has put up the 'For Sale' sign and expect other potential
buyers to appear. They added that with a hostile bid out of the question,
contenders will have to pay a premium price to buy off the recalcitrant MAM
shareholders, and Pounds 12 a share was still in sight. Others are more
cynical. One leading analyst said: 'I do not see anyone coming to buy
yesterday's merchant bank.'
The news that the deal was off came when many dealers were at lunch and sent
Warburg's share price spiralling downwards. The sudden shift of the price at
which dealers were prepared to offer stock prompted a sharp backwardation -
a situation where bid and offer prices are technically reversed. The shares
tumbled 80, bounced and then dropped back to close 99 off at 699p with 4.9m
traded. Mercury Asset Management retreated 67 to 678p.
The news took the shine off the other perceived bid targets within the
sector. Smith New Court lost 12 at 415p and Kleinwort Benson shed 22 to
519p.
Profit-taking in bid target Northern Electric gathered pace after the
Department of Trade and Industry emphasised that it would hold on to its
golden shares in UK utilities until March 1995.
Trafalgar House confirmed market speculation on Wednesday that it was
considering a bid for Northern. Analysts were not completely surprised by
the DTI announcement, but one said: 'This is just prolonging the
inevitable.'
Shares in Northern reversed Wednesday's strong rise and slipped 26 to 984p
in busy trade of 2.4m. The company also said it had requested a stock
exchange enquiry into the rise in its shares before Trafalgar stated its
intentions.
The view taken by some analysts is that there is better value elsewhere in
the sector. Mr Kevin Lapwood at Smith New Court was among those that back
such a view and he said: 'On a break-up value we would rate Northern at
1160p. But we value Norweb at 1280p, East Midlands at 1100p and South Wales
at 1250p.'
Norweb also suffered from profit-taking and retreated 9 to 791p, but East
Midlands jumped 29 to 798p and South Wales moved forward 7 1/2 to 834 1/2 p.
Other big moves included Manweb, up 24 at 855p, and Midlands, 32 higher at
836p.
Trafalgar, which advanced 1 1/2 to 73 1/2 p, was boosted by the release of
favourable full-year figures which saw the company turn a Pounds 347m loss
last year into a Pounds 45.6m profit this year. The group also ruled out a
rights issue should it decide to go ahead with a bid for Northern Electric.
Pharmaceuticals stocks received support in the US, with some feeling that
the sector will receive a fundamental rerating next year. There was some
technical London selling ahead of futures expiry in the UK but there was
specific interest in SmithKline Beecham, up a penny at 445p following a well
received presentation earlier in the week, and in Zeneca, perceived as a
possible bid candidate and which rose 6 to 858p. Wellcome, a penny off at
671p, has attracted steady takeover speculation but the shares were
restrained yesterday as the market reacted to a story in the US that was
critical of Aids drug combinations. Wellcome manufactures the leading Aids
treatment AZT, or Retrovir.
Positive clinical trial reports from Scotia Holdings on its cancer treatment
saw the shares forge ahead 21 to 274p.
Asda's strong interims helped to push the shares up  1/2 to 64p, but
turnover was relatively modest at 7m and the rest of the sector was mostly
easier. J. Sainsbury dipped 2 to 388p and Tesco shed 3 to 234p.
The results were comfortably ahead of City expectations and most securities
houses upgraded full-year profits forecasts, although reduced depreciation
accounted for most of the unforeseen gains.
BZW's full-year estimate was moved up by Pounds 15m to Pounds 230m, with the
investment bank taking a shine to like-for-like sales growth of 7 per cent
over the first 28 weeks of 1994-95.
Standard Chartered moved ahead 13 to 275p as various houses stressed their
positive views following news that the bank is to reduce costs through staff
cuts.
Abbey National improved a penny to 407p as James Capel published a buy
recommendation arguing that the former building society would benefit from a
lower cost base and increased market share.
Media conglomerate Pearson dropped 12 to 557p on unwinding of technical long
positions.
Yorkshire Television fell 7 to 373p on turnover of 3m, with investment fund
M&amp;G believed to have contributed heavily to the selling.
Food manufacturers were a mixed bag. Unilever rose 13 to 1123p following a
buy recommendation from NatWest Securities, but Cadbury-Schweppes shed a
further 9 to 395p for a two-day decline of 14 as worries built up over the
possibility of soft drink demand looking sick against warm-weather inflated
1994 volumes.
News that AG Barr, number three in the soft drinks league, had gained the
take-home franchise for Orangina International helped to lift Barr 13 to
383p. Edible oils specialist Acatos &amp; Hutcheson jumped 14 to 264p on the
back of strong prelims and an extra penny on the dividend.
A complex deal involving a steel mill disposal, an effective share buy-back,
a rights issue and a French acquisition led to heavy trading in ASW, which
closed 20 higher at 215p after 1.7m turnover.
Motor components group BSG International also met with big turnover.
Following boardroom moves and a meeting with analysts the shares rose 1 1/2
to 55 1/2 p in 7.1m traded.
Housebuilders managed a modest rebound, with Barratt Developments improving
6 to 151p in 1.6m turnover and Bryant adding 3 1/2 at 122p. The improving
sentiment was helped by a return to profit at YJ Lovell, which bounded ahead
by 12 per cent, adding 7 at 60p.
Among building materials issues, Blue Circle dipped 5 to 265p but Rugby
gained 3 1/2 at 106p. RMC slid 23 to 941p, although in each case trading
volume was nominal.

FT  16 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures moved narrowly in low volume, with trading mostly
underpinned by profit-taking on the back of Wednesday's strong gains, writes
Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract, which expires this morning, stood at 2,974
at the close of pit trading, down four points. The March contract was three
points easier at 2,994.
The December contract was right in line with the cash market, while March
closed at a 19-point premium - broadly in the middle of dealers' range of
fair value premiums.
In contrast to Wednesday when the session was marked by steady buying,
activity was flat, with less than 15,000 contracts traded and substantial
spread trading into the March contract.
Where there was business it was mostly generated by profit-taking, although
expiry influences and year-end book adjustments were clearly also factors at
play. The best of the day for the March contract was 3,019.
Option turnover was also dull, tailing away to 30,666 lots from 43,329 on
Wednesday. Put volume had the edge on calls, while FT-SE and Euro FT-SE
trading accounted for just under 22,000 contracts.
Abbey National was the most active stock option, followed by Scottish Power
and Cadbury-Schweppes. Abbey National saw 2,020 lots transacted.

FT  16 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Impending expiry and bid failure
upset equities - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News that merger discussions between SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley had been
terminated hit the UK equity market like a bombshell and eroded much of the
recent takeover enthusiasm in London.
The news, coupled with determined efforts by some marketmakers to drive the
market down ahead of this morning's expiry of the December Footsie future,
saw an early attempt by the FT-SE 100 Index to break through the 3,000
barrier come to nothing.
At the end of a session fraught with anxiety for some of the speculators
that have piled into the merchant banks and utilities areas, the FT-SE 100
Index settled 7.2 down at 2,973.4, only marginally above the day's low of
2,973.2.
The late slide in the FT-SE 100 also impacted on the market's second-liners,
with the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which posted a 16-point gain in mid-morning,
closing only 8.3 ahead on balance at 3,413.9.
Adding to the speculators' worries was a sharp fall in shares of Northern
Electric. However, many of the other regional electricity stocks continued
to make rapid progress amid a general feeling that a spate of takeover bids
in the sector could materialise in coming months. Water stocks, too, were
viewed as takeover targets.
Market observers were surprised at the late sell-off, pointing out that
European markets had been expected to take heart from another impressive
showing from Wall Street, which shrugged off slightly disappointing news of
the Philadelphia index and powered ahead shortly after the opening when it
was trading around 20 points higher.
Brokers were by no means disheartened by the day's news. 'UK plc is at just
the right stage of the cycle to attract a surge of takeover activity; the
stock market is not overbought, inflation is under control and there are
plenty of cash rich companies looking to expand and pick up good quality
assets. January and February will be good months to be in the stock market,'
was the view of one senior broker.
Earlier, the UK market had performed well, coming within two points of the
3,000 mark on the FT-SE 100, after news that retail sales remained sluggish
in November, news that was seen as consistent with trends revealed in the
last Confederation of British Industry survey of distributive trades.
With the market still bubbling from talk of plenty more takeover bids to
come in the near future, the FT-SE 100 was trading around 13 points up when
details of the aborted merger talks between SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley
filtered into the market.
Dealers said many speculators simply panicked and there was talk of severe
losses among private investors.
Towards the close of business, however, there was keen support for Warburg
shares amid stories of other potential bidders already holding talks with
the UK's premier merchant bank.
But with Morgan Stanley seen as keen to take in a top investment management
group, there were good gains in that area of the market, groups such as
Gartmore, Henderson Administration, Johnson Fry, M &amp; G and Perpetual all
attracting support.
As Warburg tumbled, so did the FT-SE 100. It dipped into the red over the
lunchtime period and continued to slip away for the rest of the session.
Although subdued by the day's events, dealers expressed satisfaction at the
upturn in activity in recent sessions. Turnover fell just short of 700m,
with non-FT-SE 100 stocks accounting for 59 per cent of the total. The value
of customer business this week is well up on recent trading sessions, with
Wednesday's figure reaching Pounds 1.58bn, compared with Tuesday's Pounds
1.6bn and the previous week's best of Pounds 1.34bn.

FT  16 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Rates outlook helps Dow to
build on gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US equities added to Wednesday's gains on speculation that the Federal
Reserve would not raise interest rates next week, writes Lisa Bransten in
New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 19.18 higher at 3,765.47.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 put on 0.37 at 455.34, the
American Stock Exchange composite rose 2.95 to 426.02 and the Nasdaq
composite advanced 5.01 to 730.68. Trading volume on the New York SE
totalled 337m shares.
A survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia showed December
business activity declining to 28.9 per cent. It was the second month that
the index, derived from a survey of businesses, showed a drop in business
activity.
That news, combined with low inflation figures released on Wednesday, was
enough to persuade the market that the Fed would not increase interest rates
again at the December 20 meeting of its open market committee.
In addition to the change in sentiment, share prices were pushed up by
technical trading and program buying in advance of tomorrow's expiration of
options and futures on stock indices in the last hour of trading.
Morgan Stanley retreated Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 61 after the investment
bank announced that merger talks with SG Warburg had been terminated.
JP Morgan extended the previous day's fall by Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 57 3/8
. The bank said on Wednesday that fourth-quarter earnings would not be as
high as those of the third quarter because of declining trading revenues,
and yesterday an analyst at Goldman Sachs lowered his rating of the
commercial bank from 'market performer' to 'market underperformer'.
Sprint tumbled Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 26 7/8 after the company announced
that it expected fourth-quarter income to be below that of the third
quarter.
General Mills added to gains made on Wednesday afternoon after the company
said it would spin off its restaurant division. In the wake of that
announcement, analysts at two securities firms raised their ratings on the
stock. The stock climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 57 5/8 yesterday.
Canada
Toronto posted its second straight day of broadly based gains, with only the
gold shares group trailing.
The TSE 300 index ended 32.88 ahead at 4,111.73. Rises outpaced declines by
452 to 293 after volume of 57.7m shares. Golds was the only easier sector,
losing 0.94 per cent in spite of the New York spot bullion price adding
USDollars 1.50 an ounce.
Brazil
The Sao Paulo market fell 2.7 per cent, pulled down by tumbling prices in
the electricity sector as Congress failed to approve a new concessions law.
The Bovespa index finished 1,342 down at 48,426.
Turnover was a robust RDollars 528m, with RDollars 238m seen in options
trading ahead of the expiry day next Monday.

FT  16 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Golds weaken in S Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg was mixed, with gold shares, which had earlier been in positive
territory, turning back later in the day to close with a loss of 60.3 at
1,831.6. Brokers attributed the change in sentiment to technical trading
related to options expiry.
The overall index moved ahead 29.3 to 5,666.6 and industrials 73.6 to
6,827.3.
Dealers said the market did not respond to a stronger financial rand, which
increases the price foreign investors pay for domestic shares. Among golds,
Dries fell R3 or 5.2 per cent to R55 and Kloof R1.25 to R54.75.

FT  16 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Siemens boosts Dax ahead of
triple-witching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some bourses were thankful for the overnight rise in the Dow, writes Our
Markets Staff. But at the end of the European day, they seemed unwilling to
move on the prospect that Wall Street could rise for the second day in
succession.
FRANKFURT waxed on Wall Street's overnight gains and on short-covering ahead
of today's 'triple-witching' expiry of DTB options and futures contracts.
The Dax index rose 27.82 to 2,052.59 on the session, with 16 points of that
due to post-bourse gains on Thursday.
Turnover was flat at DM5bn. After hours, the Ibis-indicated Dax held its
ground, closing at 2,054.23. Mr Jens Wiecking, at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf,
said that 2,050 on the Dax was a crucial level for dealers ahead of the
derivatives expiry; and that they had achieved this by bumping up the price
of a few index heavyweights, particularly that of Siemens which ended the
afternoon with a gain of DM18.50 at DM624.50. The electrical group's results
and prospects, laid out yesterday, were in line with expectations.
Meanwhile, a better than expected report from Degussa last Tuesday earned
more rewards, the shares rising a further DM13.80 to DM447 for a three-day
gain of 5.8 per cent.
PARIS managed a slight rise in a session characterised by mixed trading. The
CAC-40 index added 1.08 to 1,931.10 in turnover of around FFr3bn.
Following strength during the early part of the day, weakness in the bond
market later reversed the trend.
Peugeot lost FFr6 to FFr747 after announcing that second half results would
be more or less in line with earnings during the first six months of the
year. Renault eased 50 centimes to FFr179.80 as it confirmed that it was to
cut 1,735 jobs, while Michelin moved FFr2.40 ahead to FFr194.20.
Euro Disney rose another 15 centimes to FFr9.75, as it built on Wednesday's
gains which came after the theme park operator said that it was to cut
admission prices.
AMSTERDAM took in another steep fall in Fokker, off a further 16 per cent as
the shares slid to a close of Fl 10.30. Not even news that it had secured an
order for the sale of three of its 70 series aircraft to an Austrian
operator could brake the downturn.
Investors have been unnerved by the announcement from the aircraft maker, in
which Dasa of Germany has a majority stake, that it would be unable to make
progress on cutting its losses this year, partly as a result of its exposure
to the weak dollar. While Fokker's costs are incurred in guilders, the
aircraft are sold in dollars.
The AEX index added 0.50 to 407.69, down from a session high of 409.221.
Unilever closed with a strong rise of Fl 2.10 to Fl 199.30, helped by a
broker's buy recommendation, while KPN remained actively traded, putting on
a further Fl 1.10 to Fl 56.70.
ZURICH held on to most of its early gains, as fears of US inflation subsided
after Wednesday's economic data. The SMI index finished 16.6 stronger at
2,598.0.
Further strength in the pharmaceutical sector led the market higher. Roche
certificates added SFr80 to SFr6,080 and Ciba, which reiterated its forecast
of a slight increase in operating profits for 1994, rose SFr6 to SFr772.
CS Holding eased SFr4 to SFr529 on selling sparked by a newspaper report
that Orange County, California planned to file a suit against its CS First
Boston subsidiary.
Swiss Re was SFr10 higher at SFr789 as investors awaited a press conference,
after the market closed, at which the insurer and CS Holding announced a
strategic alliance to develop financial derivatives on reinsurance products.
Landis &amp; Gyr extended Wednesday's advance rising SFr35 to SFr795, in a
further response to the company's higher net profits and dividend. The share
was further supported by a Credit Suisse buy recommendation.
SMH rose SFr20 to SFr618 with the announcement that it expected a lower 1994
profit coming as little surprise.
MILAN moved ahead on bargain hunting fuelled by some foreign demand. The
Comit index rose 8.92 or 1.5 per cent to 591.83, many investors apparently
having now discounted the early departure of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime
minister.
Bargain hunting lifted blue chips, Telecom Italia rising L169 or 4.7 per
cent to L3,762 and Fiat picking up L166 to L5,498, recouping all of
Wednesday's fall.
Credito Romagnolo added L536 to L18,347 as investors awaited news from
Cariplo on whether it would launch a bid to rival Credito Italiano's offer.
Italiano picked up L51 to L1,621.
Cartiere Burgo jumped L275 to L10,118 as it received another recommendation,
this time from Mr Nicholas Potter at Credito Italiano International. With
reduced energy costs, more modern plant and an improving paper price, Mr
Potter expected the company to hit peak margins easily in 1997 and he
forecast significant potential for the share price to rise over the next two
years.
MADRID, down for its sixth trading day in succession, traded in line with a
Kleinwort Benson prediction that short term bond market weakness could push
equities lower. The general index fell another 1.91 to 297.43.
However, Ms Clare Miles of KB was still looking for a medium term recovery,
saying that bond market stability and a recovery in consumer confidence, as
well as stronger economic growth could take the index up to 345 by the end
of next year.
HELSINKI was lifted by the forestry and engineering group, Repola, and the
telecoms-based Nokia. The Hex index closed 13.0 ahead at 1,818.6, Repola
putting on FM2.90 at FM84.90 on its plans to list its engineering
subsidiary, Rauma. Nokia rose FM6 to FM680 following overnight gains on Wall
Street.

The Nikkei 225 average gained 189.63 at 19,121.12, its first close above
19,000 in a week. It ranged from a low of 18,964.19 to a high of 19,177.54,
profit-takers cutting back some of the rise near the close.
Volume increased from 219.4m to an estimated 269m shares. The Topix index of
all first section stocks advanced 10.75 to 1,508.79 and the capital-weighted
Nikkei 300 added 2.29 at 279.08, while rises led falls by 694 to 275, with
198 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 3.45 at
1,261.60.
Futures-linked transactions were once again a factor in early trading, when
overnight gains in Chicago futures prompted arbitrageurs to purchase Tokyo
shares. Heavy buying by domestic financial institutions through Daiwa
Securities and Goldman Sachs also pushed up prices in the morning.
Life insurance companies continued to buy shares through domestic brokerage
houses. Their targets included Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance, up Y15 at
Y742, and trading house Marubeni, ahead Y5 at Y530. Other trading companies
also advanced, Sumitomo adding Y15 at Y1,010 and Mitsubishi Y20 at Y1,300.
Boosted by a business daily report projecting a 32 per cent year-on-year
increase in consolidated pre-tax profits, automotive electronics parts maker
Nippondenso firmed Y10 to Y2,060. It is a major supplier to Toyota, Y10
higher at Y2,070.
Most other auto makers strengthened. Nissan moved up Y5 to Y810 in the day's
sixth highest volume of 3.6m shares. Honda gained Y20 at Y1,710, but Suzuki
Motor was off Y10 at Y2,110.
Privatised stocks were mixed. Japan Tobacco rose for the second straight
day, adding Y7,000 at Y914,000. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained Y7,000
at Y848,000, but East Japan Railway slipped Y2,000 to Y467,000.
Steelmakers advanced on active buying by investment trust fund managers.
Nippon Steel, the day's volume leader, climbed Y6 to Y363, Sumitomo Metal
Industries Y7 to Y315, Kawasaki Steel Y8 to Y405 and NKK Y4 to Y268.
Shipbuilders also firmed. Hitachi Zosen was up Y7 at Y532, Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Y9 at Y723 and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Y5 at Y442.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 112.97 to 20,851.46 in volume of 148.5m
shares.
Roundup
The region was very active yesterday.
HONG KONG was lifted 3.2 per cent as both domestic and foreign investors
made selective purchases of blue chips. The Hang Seng index rose 262.21 to
8,259.56 in turnover of HKDollars 3.6bn, compared with HKDollars 3.8bn on
Wednesday.
Brokers said previously oversold property and banking stocks were the most
sought after. Swire Pacific 'A' led gainers, adding HKDollars 2.60 or 5.8
per cent at HKDollars 47.30.
Wing Lung Bank forged ahead 4.9 per cent to HKDollars 53, China Light 5.9
per cent to HKDollars 33.70 and Wharf 6.6 per cent to HKDollars 24.90.
The H-share index of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong was also pushed up,
jumping 73.32 or 7.3 per cent to 1,077.13. Brokers attributed the gain to a
technical rebound after being heavily oversold in the past few days.
SHANGHAI saw a contrasting performance between the A shares, available to
domestic investors, and the B shares, which are traded by foreign
institutions. While the B index closed 1.6 per cent down at a year's low of
59.998, the A index surged 7 per cent to 689.561.
Brokers put down weakness in the B index to the disappointing performance of
Shanghai New Asia Group, the hotel and restaurant concern which made its
debut this week. It fell 7.42 per cent from an issue price of Dollars 0.350.
Analysts said the New Asia listing had come at a time when some foreign
investors were repatriating funds following the recent round of rises in US
interest rates, and expectations that the US Federal Reserve would lift
rates again in the short term.
Regarding the interest in domestic stocks, Credit Lyonnais remarked that
this was a result of unconfirmed reports that the total share issue quota in
1995 would be reduced from Rmb5.5bn to Rmb2bn.
In Shenzhen, the A index gained 10.8 per cent at 152.49 and the B index fell
3.56 per cent to 89.90.
SYDNEY closed sharply higher, boosted by Wall Street's strong overnight
performance. The All Ordinaries index rose 31.2 or 1.7 per cent to 1,895.0
in turnover of ADollars 472m. Gains were concentrated in industrials.
The futures contract ended at a 14-point premium to the cash market, with a
rally of 2.1 per cent.
SINGAPORE rallied sharply on bargain hunting following recent losses. The
Straits Times Industrial index added 66.23 or 3.13 per cent at 2,180.23.
KUALA LUMPUR built on Wednesday's 4 per cent advance. The composite index
put on 13.62 or 1.45 per cent at 950.77, after hitting a high of 964.82 in
the morning. Profit-taking in the afternoon generally pared rises.
WELLINGTON gained momentum in the afternoon, helped by a rise in forestry
stocks. The NZSE-40 capital index firmed 10.5 to 1,906.22 in turnover of
NZDollars 54.7m.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Italian lira firms in spite of political
uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian lira yesterday finished firmer on the foreign exchanges in spite
of lingering political uncertainty in the country, writes Philip Gawith.
The currency closed in London at L1,039 per D-Mark from L1,042. It was
buoyed by rallies in the futures and equity markets, where foreign buying
was evident. The lira was also helped by some D-Mark selling, as investors
took profits following the recent rally.
Although Italy appears most likely to provide some sort of currency move in
the Christmas period, markets are showing increasing signs of having shut up
shop for the year.
The only scheduled events now likely to shift foreign exchanges from their
torpor are the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting next Tuesday, and
the Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday.
The dollar had a very subdued day, finishing little changed at DM1.5718,
from DM1.5691, and at Y100.31 from Y100.26. It ended in New York at DM1.5710
and Y100.375.
Sterling also traded in a very narrow range, with the trade weighted index
unchanged all day at 80.3. It closed at DM2.4542 and Dollars 1.5615.
In Europe, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, said the
franc had room to appreciate. He added that the Bank was determined to keep
the franc stable during the coming presidential elections. It recently
touched a 12-month low.
Financial markets appear now to be working on the premise that Italian Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi and his government will not survive. Not only is
opposition outside the government intensifying, opposition from within the
coalition has picked up.
Political analysts have also interpreted negatively the length - seven hours
 -of Mr Berlusconi's meeting, earlier this week, with magistrates
investigating corruption.
Mr Giorgio Radaelli, international economist at Lehman Brothers, said he
felt fairly sure that Italy would have a new government by early February.
The implications of this scenario for the lira, however, are uncertain.
Mr Radaelli comments: 'I think the lira has pretty much discounted all bad
news. The foreign component of the market particularly would like to see a
new prime minister. There was a clash between Berlusconi and Bossi (a
coalition partner) which made this government very unproductive over the
past three months. The bond market also did not like Berlusconi's populism.'
On the other hand, markets are worried about a possible government hiatus
lasting a few weeks. Mr Radaelli said these concerns had the potential to
take the lira lower, although this could be offset by the passage of the
budget.
While the dollar is trading steadily, the short-term risks appear to be on
the downside. The price component of the Philadelphia index was weaker than
market expectations. It was the latest of a string of figures suggesting
that the Fed might leave interest rates on hold when it meets next week.
The March Eurodollar contract rose to 92.81, from 92.76, reflecting the
market's increasing conviction that rates may not rise until the new year.
Mr Peter Luxton, analyst at MMS, said: 'The dollar is a bit vulnerable to
that. It has been built up on expectations of a Fed tightening.'
The dollar has rallied since late October. It has risen by around 5.5 per
cent against the D-Mark, and 3.5 per cent against the yen. While many
observers have wondered whether this might mean the dollar has bottomed,
dollar bears remain unrepentant.
A Swiss Bank source said the dollar was more likely to see Y80 before Y120.
Contrary to analysts suggesting that the US's current account deficit had
peaked, he said the 1994 figure could get close to the 1987 record, with
1995 perhaps exceeding it.
Also bearish is SG Warburg, which remains 'fundamentally negative about the
dollar . . . our view is that the late 1994 recovery in the dollar
constitutes little more than a pause in its downtrend and renewed
depreciation to around DM1.40 and Y93 lies ahead over the next several
months'.
On a 12 to 18-month view, however, the investment bank believes a cyclical
recovery will take the dollar back to around DM1.65 and Y112.
In its daily operations, the Bank of England cleared a Pounds 1.35bn
shortage at established rates. Overnight money traded in the 4 to 6 1/2 per
cent range.

FT  16 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
World demand for wool at auctions around the world has been strong enough to
maintain prices in the final week before the Christmas recess in the selling
season. Merinos have tended very slightly dearer from time to time, New
Zealand crossbreds tended to ease again, and some British wools sold at
usefully higher prices at this week's Bradford auction. With British wool
demand stemmed originally from China rather than local processors who
normally dominate this sector. Elsewhere in the raw wool market is not
reflected in current demand from the retail end of the trade. Trading
conditions in the high street are extremely competitive and the
manufacturing industry continues to find it very difficult to pass on cost
increases in wool, with currency rates adding to the rises, as well as rises
in other fibre costs.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU agriculture ministers agree
environmental set-aside plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Union farm ministers agreed yesterday to draw up new rules on
cereal acreage set-aside enabling farmers to plant trees or opt for
environmental improvement schemes on idled land.
Farmers are required to set aside 12 per cent of their arable land this year
in an effort to curb over-production of cereals. Under the current rules,
producers are not allowed to use land planted with trees or turned over to
environmental management schemes to count towards their set-aside
allocation. Environmentalists say this has discouraged many farmers from
taking up some of the schemes that are available.
The UK has been pushing hard for a change in the set-aside rules and
welcomed the council's commitment to link market and environmental
set-aside. The European Commission will now draw up formal proposals.
Mr William Waldegrave, UK agriculture minister, said: 'The Commission's
report endorses our view that we should be allowed to promote more
environmentally sensitive use of set-aside, especially on marginal land'.
Farmers are expected to be able to put their set aside land into a variety
of schemes including: recreating flood meadows, grazing marshes and other
wetlands, re-establishing lowland heath land, creating reed-beds to benefit
wildlife as well as planting trees.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said the decision 'has taken a
very important step towards restoring the UK countryside'.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME copper market touches 5 1/4
 year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Copper prices on the London Metal Exchange yesterday surged to their highest
levels for five and a quarter years. Aggressive buying by traders, producers
and consumers helped the market move upwards, analysts said. That attracted
new money from investment funds, which swamped some profit-taking by other
funds.
Prices suggested that supplies of copper for immediate delivery were tight.
At the close last night the backwardation, or premium for immediate delivery
compared with delivery in three months, widened from Dollars 52.50 a tonne
on Wednesday to Dollars 59.50.
Traders reported there was nervousness in the market about the approaching
'third Wednesday' options activity next week which also focused attention on
copper's supply tightness.
'Copper will remain tight until significant new supply hits the market - and
that's six months away,' said Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain &amp; Co, a
Deutsche Bank subsidiary. He suggested the three-month copper price, which
closed last night at Dollars 2,979.50 a tonne after reaching Dollars 2,990
at one point, was on target for Dollars 1.40 a pound (Dollars 3,085.60 a
tonne). 'I would not be surprised to see copper at Dollars 1.50 to Dollars
1.60 a pound in the first quarter (of 1995),' Mr Bielski added.
Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, said
copper had 'the best fundamentals' of any of the LME-traded metals. In his
monthly metals report he suggested copper could reach Dollars 1.40 to
Dollars 1.50 a pound and that 'the high will probably come during the second
quarter, which traditionally is the strongest quarter for (metals)
consumption'.
He recalled that the highest price paid for LME copper was Dollars 3,707 a
tonne or Dollars 1.68 a pound on December 8, 1988, at which time the
cash-to-three month premium was Dollars 546 a tonne.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Miners find grounds for
optimism in PNG - The resource-rich but notoriously unpredictable Pacific
nation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three months ago, mining companies held their breath as the government
changed in Papua New Guinea, the resource-rich but notoriously unpredictable
Pacific nation.
Out went Mr Paias Wingti, the former prime minister, whose administration
was regarded as maverick and internally divided. In came Sir Julius Chan,
PNG's first finance minister after independence in 1975, who previously held
the prime minister's job between 1980 and 1982.
In its first 100 days, the new Chan government has given the resources
community some grounds for optimism. Negotiations over the potential
structure of the large ADollars 1bn-plus Lihir gold mine project, a joint
venture between Britain's RTZ and Niugini Mining, have resumed. Last week,
in Sydney, Sir Julius said he viewed 'fast-tracking' this development as
second in importance only to resolving the secessionist dispute which has
been raging on the PNG-controlled island of Bougainville.
Even more recently, Mr John Giheno, PNG's mining minister, returned from a
meeting with landowners in Lihir, saying that all parties had agreed to work
towards a February 28 date for the issue of the 'special mining lease',
which would allow the project to proceed. The SML was originally due a year
ago, but differences within the Wingti government ground the approval
process to a halt.
In the course of his Australian visit, Sir Julius also noted that Lihir was
not the only project to be progressing. He pointed to the recent final
go-ahead for an oil refinery to be built at Motukea Island, close to Port
Moresby, the capital. This would be the country's first major refinery and,
assuming finance is organised, could get under way by the middle of next
year. The international consortium behind the project has retained
Prudential-Bache's Australian office to look at local listing possibilities.
The PNG prime minister said that there had been a 16 per cent increase in
'grassroots' exploration expenditure in PNG in 1994 and held out the
prospect of a further rise in 1995. The number of new licences granted in
1994 was twice the 1993 level, he said.
But resources policy and economic development have always been closely bound
together in Papau New Guinea, and while some clouds have been lifting on the
former score, the latter has become increasingly obscured.
By its own admission, the PNG government is facing a serious cash crunch.
Stories have circulated of unpaid bills, including some owed to Australian
exporters. Mr Chris Haiveta, PNG's finance minister, has denied that there
will be any reneging on obligations, but conceded that people will 'have to
wait in line'.
Senator Gareth Evans, Australia's foreign minister, has said that his
country has brought forward remaining 1994 aid payments to PNG - which total
around ADollars 300m - to help alleviate the short-term situation while the
country goes about negotiating longer-term facilities with the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank. Mr Peter Sullivan, vice-president of the
Manila-based Asian Development Bank, recently described PNG's macroeconomic
problems, which are largely blamed on runaway public expenditure, as an
'emergency'.
But aside from promoting PNG's desire to fast-track developments to provide
future income and growth, this economic plight could have direct
repercussions for a number of existing resource projects.
First, there are suggestions that the PNG government may not now complete
the vexed deal that was designed to see it lift its stake in the large
Porgera gold mine from 10 per cent 25 per cent. This was to be achieved by
the purchase of additional 5 per cent interests from the three commercial
partners - Placer, Renison Gold Fields and Highlands Gold.
The companies involved say there has been no formal reopening of
negotiations over Porgera, although the rearrangement of equity stakes
should have been completed many months ago. However, the notion has been
sounded informally in Port Moresby. The additional shares were to be bought
for around K140m (Pounds 77m), money the government certainly lacks at
present.
Secondly, there is the question of whether the government tries to raise
funds from the disposal of other resource interests, such as its 22.5 per
cent share in Kutubu. According to Mr Haiveta, McIntosh, the Australian
broking firm which has an office in Port Moresby, had been asked to do a
full valuation of all assets. Both he and Sir Julius also remain
enthusiastic about the prospect of a local PNG stock exchange, on which some
holdings might eventually be sold.
But whether such moves persuade the international investment community that
PNG has become a significantly better risk, when the economic situation
remains so parlous, has yet to be seen. An abrupt decision to float PNG's
currency, the kina, last October, may not have helped, smacking for some of
the country's familiar unpredictability. 'I think people want to see runs on
the board,' says one mining executive.
Last week, Sir Julius was being realistic. Noting that his own ascent to the
office has already come under legal challenge from political opponents -
precisely the maneouvre that felled Mr Wingti - he said only that he hoped
to see 'a little glow at the end of the tunnel' in six months time.

FT  16 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Cocoa futures firmer - Market
Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COCOA futures closed firmer at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday,
helped by short-covering and technical chart support. A bullish New York,
fuelled by investment fund and speculative buying, was also encouraging,
traders said.
The March contract closed Pounds 42 up at Pounds 973 a tonne, and just off a
high of Pounds 985.
'Short covering has been the main dynamism but there was also a strong
technical motivation,' a trader said.
There was little momentum driving the PRECIOUS METAL markets after a
lack-lustre morning and quiet start to the New York session, dealers said.
GOLD continued to edge higher, closing in London at Dollars 379.85 a troy
ounce, up 75 cents on the day and Dollars 2.25 on the week so far.
At the London Metal Exchange NICKEL's recovery from its early-week shake-out
continued at great pace with speculators falling over themselves to get back
into the volatile market. Short-covering and stop-loss buying fuelled the
rise, which saw three months business up to Dollars 8,890 a tonne before
trade selling and profit-taking reversed the trend.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Old gold mines index to go
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Financial Times will cease calculating and publishing its old gold mines
index after February 28, 1995. The index, which is based on the performance
of South African companies only and was launched in September, 1955, was
replaced by one with a broader scope earlier this year.
Gold mining companies from all over the world are included in the new index
if they:
Have sustainable, attributable gold production of at least 300,000 ounces a
year;
Draw at least 75 per cent of revenue from mined gold sales;
Have at least 10 per cent of their issued capital available to the investing
public.
These conditions mean that there are no set number of constituents and the
eligibility of each company will be reviewed four times a year.
Copies of the list of constituent companies and of the ground rules of the
FT Gold Mines Index are available from The Manager, FT Statistics, One
Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL. A disc with the index's history will be
available from the same address when calculation of the predecessor index
series ceases.
The Mining Journal provides technical and financial information to assist
calculation of the FT Gold Mines Index.
At present in the new index Australasia is represented by Dominion Mining;
Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie; Homestake Gold Australia; Newcrest Mining; Placer
Pacific; Plutonic Resources and Poseidon Gold. Canadian constituents include
American Barrick Resources; Cambior; Echo Bay Mines; Hemlo Gold Mines;
Pegasus Gold; Placer Dome and TVX Gold.
From Ghana there is Ashanti Goldfields and South Africa is represented by
Beatrix; Buffelsfontein; Driefontein; Elandsrand; Freegold; Harmony;
Hartebeestfontein; Kinross; Kloof; Randfontein; Southvaal; Vaal Reefs;
Western Areas; Western Deep Levels and Winkelhaak.
US Mines in the new index include Battle Mountain Gold; Homestake Mining;
Newmont Gold and Santa Fe Pacific Gold.

Sugar prices are likely to stay in their current consolidation phase with
big importers such as China and Russia staying away until well into next
year, according to broker C. Czarnikow.
In its month Sugar Review Czarnikow said: 'Although renewed strength may
well emerge during the course of next year, there is now less certainty
about the direction which the market might take in the short-term and there
is likely to be a period of consolidation'.
The recent rise in sugar prices had taken place earlier than might have been

FT  16 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Short-dated US Treasuries outperform the
long end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The recent trend of yield curve flattening was broken for the second day
yesterday as the short end of the market outperformed the long bond.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1/32 at
95 13/16 yielding 7.859 per cent but the two-year note was  1/8 higher at 99
1/2 , yielding 7.509 per cent.
The market reacted quickly to a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia that showed a decline in the index of December business
activity to 28.9 per cent. It is the second month running that the index has
shown a drop in activity.
That data, combined with low inflation figures released on Wednesday, added
to trader speculation that the Fed would not raise interest rates when its
open market committee meets on December 20. Earlier this week, opinion was
mixed on whether the Fed would boost rates again before the end of the year.
The Philadelphia Fed's survey is especially important because it is an early
indicator of trends for December.
The spread between two-year and 30-year Treasuries widened for the second
consecutive day, reversing a recent trend and causing a steepening of the
yield curve. Economists view flattening of the curve as an indication that
the market expects economic slowing. The curve had flattened steadily since
the Fed raised rates by 75 basis points in November.
UK government bonds were lifted yesterday by a rise in German government
bonds and figures showing a slowdown in UK retail sales growth.
Retail sales volumes were unchanged in November from October and up 2.5 per
cent from November 1993, against a year-on-year rise of 3.0 per cent in
October.
Mr Chris Anthony at Hoare Govett said: 'The sales figures have killed off
any fears of an imminent interest rate rise.' He said investors were likely
to examine closely the CBI survey and PSBR figures due out this morning.
Trading in gilts yesterday was very thin, and dealers pointed to five tap
stocks which were announced on November 28, but have not been sold and still
overhang the market.
Dealers also point to strong resistance to prices rising above a level of
102 3/8 and although yesterday the market touched this ceiling, it bounced
down each time.
The yield spread over German government bonds tightened from 118 to around
115 basis points, and dealers said there may be some switching into bunds at
this level.
The December long gilt future moved up  5/16 to around 102 1/4 in late
trading.
German government bonds edged higher but prices remained within the range of
recent trading levels.
Mr Stefan Schneider at S. G. Warburg in Frankfurt said the movement of bunds
yesterday mimicked US Treasuries. He said: 'I cannot see any major domestic
event shifting sentiment in the bund market.'
Analysts point to next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's
policy-making open markets committee as the next event which may have an
effect on bunds, but say that until then trading is likely to stay within
the 89.50 to 89.87 range.
The spread under Treasuries shifted out from 43 basis points to 45 in slow
trading and the March bund futures contract on Liffe rose by 0.03 on the day
to 89.76.
Italian government bonds rose yesterday, in what some analysts attributed to
investors covering their short positions.
Mr Simon Maggs at IBJ said: 'The government will almost certainly fall apart
at some point. The budget will almost certainly go through and then the
market will focus on what will happen in the political situation.'
He said investors were made nervous by yesterday's announcement that the
government was to provide L11,000bn to help repair flood damage, and its
intention to pay for this increased spending by larger taxes had not allayed

The March bond futures contract on Liffe moved to around 99.49 in late

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cazenove is hoping to raise Dollars 50m from investors in London and the
Gulf for a new closed-end Indian investment fund, to be managed by Chescor.
The Oryx fund will concentrate on medium-sized and smaller companies, with
more than 70 per cent in listed companies and about a quarter in unlisted
investments.
The fund will be based in Guernsey, but listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Investments will be made through Mauritius, to take advantage of its double
taxation treaty with India. The fund aims to be 90 per cent invested within
six months of launch.
Chescor is a small London-based investment house which has already been
involved in setting up an India fund for Martin Currie.

FT  16 DEC 94 / International Bonds: Euroyen deals meet strong Japanese
demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong Japanese investor demand for yen-denominated assets brought a further
flood of issuance to the euroyen sector yesterday as the Republic of Austria
launched two offerings of yen-denominated bonds, totalling Y120bn.
Elsewhere, two borrowers revived the asset-backed sector of the sterling
market, with deals by Bristol &amp; West, the UK building society, and a group
of UK housing associations.
There was also a rush of new issuance by Brazilian borrowers in the dollar
sector to beat the feared imposition of higher capital requirements and
higher taxes on capital coming into the country, which would significantly
increase the cost of raising capital on international markets, dealers said.
Austria launched a Y60bn offering of six-year bonds priced to yield 2 basis
points over Japanese government bonds, and Y60bn of 10-year bonds priced to
yield 11 basis points over Japanese government bonds.
There has been a significant amount of issuance in yen over recent months,
as borrowers have taken advantage of strong demand for yen assets.
Japanese investors have shunned foreign currency assets this year to avoid
foreign exchange loss. Financial liberalisation in Japan has also had an
impact, allowing the primary placement of euroyen paper directly into Japan.
'There is also a feeling among Japanese investors that there is no upward
pressure on interest rates, so they are happy to invest at these levels,'
said one trader.
Austria's two offerings were placed almost entirely with Japanese investors,
joint lead manager Daiwa said.
The offering's two-tranche form was a result of distinct patterns of demand
from different investor sectors, a Daiwa syndicate official said.
The six-year issue was placed with Japanese non-life insurance companies and
regional co-operatives, while the longer-dated offering was sold to
life-insurance companies and public sector funds.
'Some of the big life insurers have significant cash positions and they are
looking very aggressively to invest these funds,' he said. The proceeds from
the offering were not swapped, sources said.
Clips No 1, a special-purpose vehicle set up by Bristol &amp; West, launched a
Pounds 150m offering of bonds of varying maturities backed by a portfolio of
commercial loans originated by the UK building society.
The main tranche was a Dollars 123.75m issue of 15-year bonds offering a
discounted margin of 31 basis points over Libor.
Lead manager Goldman Sachs said the offering was sold to investors in the UK
and France, predominantly banks but also insurance companies and money
funds.
UK Rents No 1, a special-purpose vehicle set up by a group of medium-sized
housing associations, launched Pounds 36.598m of bonds due April 2025,
backed by future rental income.

FT  16 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Bankers Trust faces sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US regulators are within days of issuing civil complaints saying Bankers
Trust violated anti-fraud provisions of securities and commodities laws in
sales of derivatives to Cincinnati-based Gibson Greetings.
The complaints will be significant beyond the Bankers Trust case because the
agencies involved reportedly have determined that the derivatives at issue -
complex forms of interest rate swaps - can be considered both futures and
securities, and are thus within the regulatory purview of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Until now, swaps have been considered neither securities nor futures, and
the swaps industry has grown rapidly in a largely unregulated environment.
Although legislative attempts to tighten the oversight of swaps have died in
the US Congress this year, the two agencies appear to be extending their
reach independently through their enforcement action against Bankers Trust.
In particular, a determination that over-the-counter derivatives are futures
would require swaps dealers to comply with the same tough anti-fraud and
sales practice rules that govern listed futures and options. The CFTC
exempted swaps from much of the US commodities law in 1992, but reserved the
right to enforce its anti-fraud provisions if a swap was determined to be a
future.
The CFTC is also drafting suitability rules for derivatives customers, and
is in the midst of a public comment period on that issue.
A source familiar with the Bankers Trust complaints said the bank is close
to reaching a settlement with the agencies, and is expected to agree to
sanctions and pay fines.
Bankers Trust earlier this month entered into an extensive written agreement
with its primary regulator, the Federal Reserve, that requires remedial
action on the way it markets derivatives to corporations. That agreement did
not specifically mention Gibson Greetings.
Last month, Bankers Trust also settled a lawsuit brought by Gibson Greetings
that complained that the bank failed to disclose essential information about
derivatives sold to the company.

FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Investors welcome spin-off of
General Mills restaurants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Investors have welcomed the decision by General Mills, the US food group, to
spin off its restaurant business and concentrate on breakfast cereals.
Yesterday its shares closed Dollars 1 3/4 higher at Dollars 57 5/8 .
The restaurant business, forecast to have revenues of Dollars 3.2bn in the
current financial year, has nearly 1,200 outlets, including the nationwide
Red Lobster and The Olive Garden chains.
Late on Wednesday, General Mills said it was divesting the company to
shareholders, giving them one share in the new business for each share in
the existing company. The restaurant company, so far unnamed, will be quoted
on the New York Stock Exchange.
General Mills said that after the split, it would become a tightly-focused
consumer food group with expected sales this financial year of about Dollars
5.5bn.
The move completes a long period of reorganisation for General Mills, during
which it has disposed of numerous peripheral business including
Kenner-Parker toys, Eddie Bauer clothing and Monet costume jewellery.
Mr Bruce Atwater, chairman and chief executive, said the latest divestment
would enhance shareholder value because separate organisations with separate
incentives would produce the strongest growth.
The split is due to take place in June next year when Mr Atwater, now 63,
retires. In the meantime, Mr Stephen Sanger, the 48-year-old president of
General Mills, has been appointed president and chief executive officer of
the company. Mr Joe Lee, General Mills's 54-year-old vice-chairman, will be
president and chief executive of the restaurant operation.
The spin-off comes as both parts of the business face tough competitive
pressures. The food side of the business, in particular, has been suffering
from tough competition in the US breakfast cereal market. Earlier this year,
General Mills cut promotional spending and slashed prices in an attempt to
increase market share.
The casual dining sector is also highly competitive in the US. Yesterday
General Mills produced figures for its second quarter to November showing
that restaurant profits had fallen by 3 per cent.

<TEXT>
Shares in Sprint, the third largest telephone company in the US, fell 11 per
cent yesterday following a warning that fourth-quarter income would be hit
by price pressures in the long-distance market.
Mr Arthur Krause, executive vice-president and chief financial officer, said
long-distance income would fall from its third-quarter high of Dollars 165m,
although it would remain above 1993's fourth-quarter figure of Dollars 133m.
The change from the strong growth seen in recent months knocked Dollars 3
7/8 off Sprint shares, which closed at Dollars 26 7/8 .
'Competition for residential customers has intensified during the quarter
and we have seen price pressures in the business market,' Mr Krause said.
AT&amp;T, the biggest long-distance phone company in the US, recently launched a
marketing campaign.
Sprint said it planned to target advertising and marketing spending in
profitable areas, but refused to give further details.
Long-distance phone services account for the bulk of Sprint's income,
amounting to 71 per cent of its Dollars 230m net income in the third
quarter.
However, Mr Krause said Sprint expected growth in volume for the fourth
quarter compared with a year ago, adding that volume in the long-distance
division would increase by between 10 and 11 per cent.
The Kansas City-based group has formed a series of alliances in recent
months to meet the growing competition in the US telecommunications
industry. In October, it formed a partnership with three US cable companies
to provide telephone, entertainment and information services.
On Tuesday, Sprint announced an alliance with Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex)
to provide services throughout North America.
Sprint said at the time its alliance with Telmex would help it create a
seamless North American telecoms network. Sprint is already aligned with
Call-Net, a Canadian long-distance carrier, and operates four cross-border
fibre optic connections with Telmex between the US and Mexico.
Mr Krause said that local and cellular operations were continuing to perform
'in line with expectations'. Cellular operations, which accounted for 14 per
cent of the company's net income in the third quarter, were its fastest
growth area.

National Health Laboratories, the US clinical laboratory company, is to
merge its clinical laboratories with those of Hoffman-La Roche, a division
of Roche Holdings, the Swiss drug and chemical group, to create a Dollars
1.7bn company.
The new company will be 'one of the largest clinical laboratories in the
US', according to NHL.
It will have a total of 40 laboratories, 17 of which are currently owned by
Roche.
Roche will bring its laboratory business, Roche Biomedical Laboratories, and
will invest Dollars 186.7m in cash for its 49.9 per cent share of the new
business.
Under the agreement, NHL shareholders will have a 50.1 per cent stake in the
new company, and will receive Dollars 5.60 cash for each of their shares.
The total payout to NHL is estimated at Dollars 475m.
NHL said the merger could mean cost savings of Dollars 90m in the first two
years.
The healthcare industry has seen severe cost pressure as a result of the
change to managed care.
Mr James Powell, currently president of RBL, will become president and chief
executive officer of the new company; Mr James Maher, CEO of NHL, will
become chairman.
The merger is subject to approval from NHL shareholders. MacAndrews &amp;
Forbes, which owns about 24 per cent of NHL, has agreed to vote for the
merger.
NHL shares closed Dollars  3/8 lower at Dollars 13 1/8.

FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Cariplo group plans counter-bid
for Rolo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A consortium led by Cariplo, the Milan-based savings bank, last night
announced plans to outbid rival Milanese bank Credito Italiano with a
L3,290bn (Dollars 2bn) offer for 70 per cent of Credito Romagnolo (Rolo) of
Bologna.
The planned counter-bid will involve Cariplo, IMI, the banking and financial
services group privatised earlier this year, and Cassa di Risparmio in
Bologna, another local bank. Cariplo could also enlist the support of other
groups, including Reale Mutua, the Italian insurance company which is a Rolo
shareholder.
The consortium plans to pay L21,500 a share, against the Credit offer of
L20,000, and bid for 70 per cent of Rolo rather than the 65 per cent stake
sought by Credit.
The Cariplo announcement was made after the Italian market closed, but
during lively trading earlier in the day, Rolo's shares rose by 3 per cent
to L18,347, and Credit's shares were up 2.5 per cent at L1,640.
Italian agencies reported that Rolo had received the Cariplo approach 'with
interest', and directors would discuss it at a board meeting tomorrow. The
Rolo board said two weeks ago that it would be up to shareholders to decide
on the merits of the Credit bid.
Cariplo and its allies could launch their bid as early as next week if they
receive the approval of the Bank of Italy and Consob, the stock exchange
watchdog. It would overlap with Credit's offer, which opens on Monday and
will run until January 16.
Cariplo - short for Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde - claims to
be the world's biggest savings bank, and the third biggest bank in Italy,
with total assets last year of more than L150,000bn. In the past few years
it has formed alliances with a series of local savings banks, giving itself
access to about 1,400 branches nationally, half of which it controls
directly.
Like many Italian banks, Cariplo is owned by a charitable foundation.
Adverse market conditions forced it to abandon plans for a flotation on the
Milan stock exchange earlier this year.

FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Highs and lows of forex hedging
 -A strong yen worked for some Japanese groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate casualties of the yen's sharp appreciation in the past five years
are a familiar story. Most of them are manufacturers who have been forced to
cut margins as the prices of their exports have risen strongly.
However, the increasing availability of more sophisticated corporate
treasury operations in the same period has meant that some companies have
been able to offset some of those losses by hedging in the forward foreign
exchange market.
At the same time, many businesses have seen their performance deteriorate as
a result of large losses on the same contracts.
Precisely who were the winners and losers and how big were their gains and
losses was unclear until this autumn, when companies were required for the
first time to disclose in detail their profits on currency hedging. A new
collation of company's results published yesterday by Tokyo Shoko Research,
a private financial research institution, shows the extent to which Japanese
businesses have used this particular derivative instrument, and how varied
the performance has been.
Total gains among companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange neatly
balanced losses. Altogether, 211 companies recorded losses of a combined
Y99.6bn (Dollars 992.1m) in the year to the end of September, as a result of
the yen's rise, while 162 reported gains of Y95.4bn.
Transport companies, especially airlines, proved the biggest losers. Between
them, companies in the transport sector lost more than Y56bn. Other losing
sectors were textiles and steel. Net losses for 15 textile manufacturers
were Y3.4bn, while eight steelmakers lost a net Y2.6bn.
As might be expected, securities companies recorded the largest net gains.
Between them, 12 brokers managed gains of more than Y6bn. Other net gainers
were transport and electrical engineering companies.
The country's two leading airlines both lost heavily as a result of
long-standing contracts to purchase US dollars at exchange rates that were
not realised. Japan Airlines (JAL) suffered the largest loss of any company,
at Y43.9bn, four times as large as the next biggest loser, All Nippon
Airlines (ANA) with losses totalling Y10.7bn.
JAL began hedging the dollar-yen rate in 1985, concluding contracts to buy a
total of Dollars 3.6bn at an exchange rate of Y165.97 to the dollar at a
series of stipulated dates. ANA made arrangements to buy Dollars 798m at an
exchange rate of Y111.85. Both companies' moves were intended to insure them
against a sharp depreciation of the yen in advance of contract payment dates
for the purchases of foreign air-craft.
In fact, the yen rose well above the contracted levels and continued to
rise. At the end of September 1994, the exchange rate stood at Y98.45 to the
dollar.
On the plus side, Nomura Securities registered the largest net profit, at
Y22.9bn, followed by Nippon Telephone and Telegraph at Y18.02bn.
The research organisation's study covered only forward exchange contracts.
Companies are not as yet required to give full details of their other
derivatives gains or losses.
Tokyo Shoko points out that the rapid growth in the use of derivatives in
the past few years makes it harder to tell the true state of a company's
financial operations. 'Future contracts disclosed this time are just a very
small part of off-balance-sheet derivatives dealings,' he says. 'Interest
rate swaps are particularly in the dark, but of growing significance.'
So the scale of most companies' dealings can only be guessed at. There is
little doubt that in Japan, as elsewhere, many companies have suffered
heavily in the past year from their derivatives trading.
The problem was glimpsed last month with the publication of results at Tokyo
Securities, a small stockbroker. Its exchange losses alone totalled Y3.1bn,
but in all the company lost Y32bn, almost a third of shareholders' capital.
The company acknowledged then that the bulk of that loss came from
fixed-interest derivatives trading.

Randgold, the smallest and least profitable of South Africa's leading gold
mining groups, plans to ensure the viability of its Durban Deep mine by
merging it with the neighbouring Rand Leases mine.
Durban Deep, which had been scheduled to close earlier this year, will
acquire all the issued shares in Rand Leases in exchange for 2.9m new Durban
Deep shares.
Mr Peter Flack, Randgold chairman, said the transaction would significantly
reduce running costs through the introduction of a single overhead structure
for the two mines, and that he hoped to refinance the enlarged company in
the new year.
Full details will be released in January. The transaction is subject to the
approval of Durban Deep shareholders, who will meet in February to assess
the plan.
Normandy Poseidon, via its industrial minerals division, has acquired a 9.1
per cent interest in Queensland Metals Corporation, writes Nikki Tait in
Sydney. The 10.8m shares comprising the stake were placed with the
Adelaide-based mining and minerals group at ADollars 1.30 each, for a total
consideration of ADollars 14m (USDollars 10.8m).
Shell Australia confirmed yesterday that it had completed the sale of a 30
per cent stake in the Worsley bauxite alumina joint venture in western
Australia to Billiton Australia, part of South Africa's Gencor. The deal is
part of Gencor's purchase of much of the Shell group's international metals
portfolio. Shell Australia said a further 6 per cent interest in Worsley had
been sold to Reynolds Australia Alumina, part of the Reynolds Metals
Company, and that it expected to complete the sale of its remaining 1.5 per
cent stake to Nissho Iwai, a Japanese trading and publishing company, by the
end of December.
MIM, the Queensland-based metals group, said it planned to increase
Australian copper sales by 50 per cent, to 90,000 tonnes next year. It said
it was aiming to fill some of the shortfall which is likely to arise when
CRA's Southern Copper refinery and smelter at Port Kembla close in January.

Tenneco, the US energy and chemicals group, is spending Dollars 120m on two

Reuter reports from Houston.
It said it was making a Dollars 75m acquisition of Pennzoil's offshore

fund.
Tenneco said the two investments supported its strategy of redeploying
capital into 'higher-return growth opportunities in its natural gas,
packaging and automotive parts businesses'.
It said the Pennzoil agreement, involving offshore oil and natural gas
properties in the Gulf of Mexico, would add more than 90bn cubic feet of
natural gas equivalent to Tenneco Ventures' reserve base.
The exact size of the Pennzoil transaction would be determined once other
parties had decided whether to exercise preferential rights to purchase the
reserves.
It said the Dollars 45m earmarked for the energy investment fund would be
invested in a combination of production, development and exploratory
properties in conjunction with independent producers.

7.96bn) and recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax -
declined to Y120.9bn amid a difficult trading environment. Net profits were
4 per cent lower at Y67.9bn.
Trading was slow in all divisions, in spite of the introduction of new
products such as the world's smallest and lightest 8mm video camera.
The company was adversely affected by intense competition both at home and
abroad, as core markets remained stagnant amid sluggish private capital
spending.
Price cuts undermined efforts by the company to reduce costs through
rationalisation measures.
In spite of the moderate recovery in the domestic market, Fuji Photo Film
expects the trading environment to remain difficult.
The company will report results for a shortened financial year as it is
changing its year-end to March 31 from October 20. It is forecasting sales
of Y346bn, recurring profits of Y50bn and net profits of Y27bn for the five
months and 11 days to the end of March.

oil-backed bonds

<TEXT>
The Venezuelan government has been in talks with international investment
banks over the possibility of next year issuing up to Dollars 1bn of bonds
collateralised by oil revenues in the international market.
Mr Julio Sosa, finance minister, said yesterday the idea was to issue the
first of the bonds - some Dollars 250m worth - in the first quarter of next
year.
Six investment banks were 'very interested' in the plans. 'If we are
successful we will place up to Dollars 1bn,' he said.
The government plans to use the funds to repay some of its Dollars 9bn in
non-restructured foreign debt in order to avoid a bunching of debt
repayments in 1996, 1997 and 1998.
The debt to be repaid would be mostly bilateral debt owed to other
governments, some of which has been in arrears and which amounts to some
Dollars 5bn.
The government has separate plans to issue dollar-denominated paper in the
domestic market, also to be collateralised by oil royalties and likely to
carry a seven-year term and 10 per cent coupon.
This week, the government began issuing two-year paper in local currency in
a bid to mop up the liquidity washing around the economy following this
year's banking crisis.
The aim is to issue up to 160bn bolivars (Dollars 940m) of this paper. The
government has temporarily stopped the central bank from issuing 90-day
zero-coupon notes in a bid to encourage banks to buy the two-year notes.

Clark USA, the oil refiner and distributor controlled by Toronto financier
Mr Peter Munk, has withdrawn a USDollars 250m financing because of weakening
capital markets, writes Robert Gibbens.
Clark, wholly-owned by Horsham Corp, Mr Munk's main holding company, had
planned to offer 7.5m shares publicly to raise Dollars 150m, and to issue
Dollars 100m of senior notes.
The shares would have represented one-third of the total outstanding. The
financing was to cover the acquisition of a Chevron refinery in the US.
'We won't sell our shares in a weak market,' said Mr Paul Melnuk, Clark
president. 'Clark is a successful independent refiner and marketer and
financially strong. We believe market conditions will improve later.'
Clark earned Dollars 20.4m in the first nine months, compared with a loss of
Dollars 4.9m last time.

J. P. Morgan, the US bank, warned that its profits for the last quarter of
the year would not match those of the previous three months, due to weaker
trading revenues, writes Richard Waters in New York.
The announcement signalled a weak end to the year generally for banks which
are active in the financial markets.
The consensus among analysts had been for earnings of Dollars 1.69 a share
in the latest period at Morgan, compared with Dollars 1.63 in the previous
quarter.
In the final three months of 1993, a period when bond markets around the
world remained strong, the US bank earned Dollars 1.92 a share.
In spite of the warning, the bank lifted its quarterly dividend by 7 cents,
to 75 cents.

FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: HK regulator cracks down on cash
commissions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), Hong Kong's corporate
regulator, yesterday said it would outlaw the payment of cash commissions to
investment fund managers in cases where trusts and mutual funds are offered
to the public.
In a decision which Jardine Fleming, Hong Kong's biggest retail fund
manager, described as a 'sledge-hammer to crack a nut', the SFC said that
all cash rebates to fund managers would have to be credited to the funds
from July next year.
It said that fund managers could keep cash commissions, or rebates, where
they manage funds on a discretionary basis, such as pension funds.
In this case the client will have to consent to the fund manager retaining
rebates and be given a periodic quantification of the value of rebates
retained.
The SFC said that managers could retain 'soft dollar' commissions. These are
where a stockbroker provides free research, computer software for portfolio
analysis, and hardware such as Reuters services.
The test would be that the benefits received are demonstrably beneficial to
investors.
Mr Stuart Leckie, chairman of Wyatt, the pensions consultant, said: 'I
believe it is an outcome that is very satisfactory under all circumstances.'
Fund managers said they could live with the decision although it meant that
management fees would probably have to rise. Some also said the end to
rebates would put pressure on fixed commission brokerages in Hong Kong.
The SFC foreshadowed its inquiry into commissions and 'soft dollars' this
summer. It raised a storm of controversy in Hong Kong, pitting Jardine
Fleming (a recipient of rebates) against Fidelity which is not allowed to
accept them but which does take 'soft dollars'.
Mr Henry Strutt, Jardine Fleming's managing director, said: 'We'll have to
look at it carefully to see what steps we can take to mitigate the
consequences.'
Of Jardine Fleming's USDollars 23bn under management some USDollars 4bn is
managed in authorised Hong Kong trusts. About USDollars 2bn is subscribed
from abroad so the manager may have to de-authorise some funds, or seek to
place them outside the SFC's jurisdiction to avoid the ruling.
Mr Ian Boyce, managing director of Schroders in Hong Kong, said his firm
will have to look at the fees it charges if rebates are to end.
'It is not going to be the end of the world for us, rebates are not that
important to us. But we will be looking closely at our fee structure,' he
said.

Nike, the US sports footwear and apparel group, is buying Canstar, Montreal,

Nike's price is CDollars 27.50 per Canstar share compared with Canstar's
share price of CDollars 17 in the market at Tuesday's close.
Nike said Canstar's principal brands, Bauer and Cooper, had global

Canstar has a strong position in in-line skating, roller hockey and figure
skating equipment. Nike said Canstar would operate as an autonomous unit

<TEXT>
CAE, the world's leading aircraft flight simulator maker, has sold its Link
military division in the US to Hughes Electronics, a subsidiary of US
carmaker General Motors, for CDollars 213m (USDollars 153m).
The Canadian electronics group has been trying to sell the loss-making Link
division for some time. It represented nearly half CAE's total sales of
CDollars 1.1bn in fiscal 1994.
Link's problems, which are partly due to cuts in US defence spending, have
depressed CAE's stock price and hurt overall performance.
The price compares with CDollars 665m paid by CAE to Singer of the US, then
controlled by American financier Mr Paul Bilzerian, for Link in 1988.
This year CAE took a CDollars 396m charge for Link and announced more
rationalisation. It will take a further CDollars 30m special charge this
year.
CAE retains certain Link products in ship machinery control, oil process
control modelling, bio-medical and entertainment simulation. It has also
retained USDollars 160m of tax losses available against future US
operations.
CAE said it would now be virtually debt-free and would concentrate on
developing its simulator and electronic controls businesses worldwide.
Following the merger of Thomson-CFS and Rediffusion in Europe, only two big
players remain in aircraft simulators.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Proventus, the Swedish investment group, yesterday launched a SKr1bn
(Dollars 132m) bid to buy out the 37 per cent outstanding stake it does not
own in its subsidiary Aritmos, the sporting goods company which includes
Puma, the German sports shoe maker.
Proventus said it had acquired the 15.2 per cent stake previously held by
the Swedish food group Cerealia, which had been Aritmos's second chief
shareholder. It was offering SKr33 per share in cash for the remaining
Aritmos shares, a premium of SKr5 over the last paid price of SKr28 reached
before Proventus and Aritmos shares were suspended on Wednesday.
The total value of the Cerealia and remaining bid was SKr1.06bn, to be
financed by bank borrowing, Proventus said.
Proventus, 70 per cent controlled by Mr Robert Weil, a Swedish private
investor, has holdings in several industrial companies including Van Roll,
the Swiss group. But it has made sporting and leisure goods its main
interest since buying into Aritmos in early 1993.
Since it won control of Aritmos it has restructured the group, spinning off
the Monark Stiga bicycles and Abu Garcia fishing equipment divisions into
separate quoted companies in which Proventus retains majority shareholdings.
Aritmos is focused on Puma, a previously troubled company which returned to
profit in the first six months of the year, Etonic, the second biggest
supplier of golf shoes in the US, and Tretorn, a leading tennis ball maker.
Aritmos reported pre-tax profits of SKr224m in the first six months on sales
of SKr3.5bn, a turnround from a SKr722m loss last year.
The bid was favoured by the Aritmos board, but it declined to take a
definitive position until it had received an independent valuation. The
offer is conditional on acceptances assuring Proventus of 90 per cent
ownership by February 3, but Proventus said it reserved the right to
complete even if the response left it short of 90 per cent.

The board of IRI, the Italian state holding company, yesterday agreed to
examine the bids for Ilva Laminati Piani, the state-owned flat steels
producer, in the hope of reaching a deal on the sale of the company before
the end of the year.
Two consortia are understood to have submitted offers for ILP. One is an
alliance between Lucchini, the private Italian steelmaker, Usinor Sacilor of
France and Bolmat, a company formed by two Italian steel traders.
The other links Riva, another private steel producer, and Tarnofin, a group
of local entrepreneurs.
IRI did not comment on the identity of the bidders or the content of the
offers yesterday, and is set to discuss the sale again at another board
meeting before Christmas. The holding company is under pressure from the
European Commission to complete the sale of ILP before the end of the year,
in line with a deal struck by EU ministers a year ago on state aids for
Ilva. If the offers prove unsatisfactory, IRI could start private
negotiations, or invite improved bids.
Snia BPD, the quoted Italian chemicals and fibres company which is part of
the Fiat group, is to invest about Dollars 50m in the construction of a
nylon wrapping production line in the Basilicata region of southern Italy.
The new line, operated by Snia BPD's Caffaro subsidiary, will have total
capacity of 4,000 to 5,000 tonnes a year and should start production in the
middle of 1996.
The company said the investment would help strengthen its position in food
packaging, while the group is planning to invest a further Dollars 15m over
four years in research and development covering other market sectors as
well.
The industrial and R&amp;D investments are part of a programme of development in
the region by Snia BPD, supported by the Italian state.

<TEXT>
Porsche, the loss-making luxury sports car maker, has set up a five-year
DM300m (Dollars 191m) credit line to fund the launch of what Mr Wendelin
Wiedeking, chairman, described yesterday as the biggest product offensive in
the company's history.
The financing for new models - due in 1996 and 1997 and including the
lower-priced Boxster aimed at younger buyers - was arranged by Dresdner
Bank's Luxembourg subsidiary and J. P. Morgan, the company said.
Confirming a sharp reduction in losses to DM150m from DM239m for the year to
the end of July, Mr Wiedeking said the business was still on course to break
even in the current year. Overall sales were ahead of budget, he claimed.
However, he said car sales in the home market and France were tending to
weaken, and complained that the introduction in Germany of a 7.5 per cent
income tax surcharge next month was unlikely to encourage consumer spending.
Germany accounts for more than a third of Porsche marque sales, and is also
the most important market for the Mercedes-Benz E500, which it builds on
contract, and a souped-up joint-venture estate car, the Audi-Porsche Avant
RS2.
Porsche has close links with the VW group, owner of Audi, through Mr
Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman, who owns 10 per cent of Porsche.
Mr Piech yesterday repeated his appeals for the German government to pay a
scrapping premium for old cars to encourage new sales. He told VW workers
that a lasting revival was not yet in sight in the domestic market.
However, worldwide group deliveries to customers had increased 7.4 per cent
in the first 11 months with most growth in the US and Asia, he said.

<TEXT>
Repola, Finland's largest industrial group, yesterday announced plans to
sell up to 30 per cent of the shares in its wholly-owned Rauma engineering
subsidiary to outside investors.
It plans to list Rauma on the Helsinki stock exchange to create 'a more
independent and high profile position' for the unit. Repola's main operation
is its forestry operation, United Paper Mills, which accounts for nearly 70
per cent of overall annual turnover of about FM27bn (Dollars 5.5bn).
Rauma has four divisions: Timberjack (forest machines), Sunds Defibrator
(fibre technology), Neles-Jamesbury (industrial valves) and Nordberg
(crushers).
The decision to sell part of the unit comes at a time when demand is
improving in all four divisions due to economic recovery and an increase in
machinery orders in the pulp and paper sector.
The group is benefiting from its strong position in the North American and
Asia-Pacific markets.
Exports and overseas activities account for about 90 per cent of Rauma's
annual turnover of about FM8bn.
In the first eight months of 1994, Rauma doubled its operating profit to
FM247m from FM124m as turnover climbed by an underlying 9 per cent to
FM5.18bn.
The unit's order book at the end of August was up 75 per cent at FM4.81bn.
The Rauma shares, which will be sold to domestic and international investors
next year, may be listed on an overseas bourse at a later date. Advisers to
the issue are S. G. Warburg Securities and Prospectus Oy.
Repola's shares ended the day FM3.50 higher at FM85.50.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Slovnaft, the Slovak petrochemical group that was forced to postpone a
planned Dollars 100m international share issue because of domestic political
instability and uncertainty on world stock markets, is to try again early
next year.
The offering, which will be the first such deal by a Slovak company, was
postponed in late November, but a senior official at Kidder Peabody, the US
investment bank leading the offering, said recently that it was scheduled to
be relaunched in the first quarter of 1995. 'We hope there will be a more
receptive market,' he said.
The offering is due to follow a rights issue of up to 3.3m shares to
existing Slovnaft shareholders. The state owns 80 per cent of the oil
refining and chemicals group, and the National Property Fund of Slovakia,
which administers state shareholdings, is believed to have indicated that it
will not take up its allotment.
This will allow those shares to be offered to foreign institutional
investors. The state's shareholding would then fall to about 65 per cent.
Other Slovnaft shareholders include Slovakia's large investment
privatisation funds.
There is still uncertainty as to the future of privatisation in Slovakia.
The new government headed by Mr Vladimir Meciar and appointed this week has
postponed a SKr60bn (Dollars 1.9bn) voucher privatisation programme in order
to remove electricity and gas distribution company shares from the sell-off.
Investment fund managers say this will reduce the size of the voucher
programme and dampen investor enthusiasm. The delay is expected to be for up
to three months. Since Slovnaft's decision to postpone the share issue its
supervisory board has been removed and replaced by allies of Mr Meciar.
Slovnaft's profits are expected to jump to SKr3bn this year compared with
SKr1.6bn in 1993.

FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Confident Siemens sees 20%
advance in profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Heinrich von Pierer, Siemens chairman, yesterday forecast a 20 per cent
surge in profits in the current financial year as Europe's biggest
electrical and electronics group emerged strengthened from a cyclical and
structural crisis.
In spite of further pressure on prices, more costly rationalisation and
unchanged earnings from financial investments, net profits would increase to
about DM2bn (Dollars 1.3bn), he claimed. Sales would rise only about DM1bn
above the DM84.6bn achieved in 1993-94, while order intake would increase by
DM1.5bn to about DM90bn at most.
News of brightening horizons at Siemens gave a lift to the Frankfurt stock
exchange and the group's own shares closed DM20.5 higher at DM623.
Mr von Pierer announced his medium-term target of raising the group's return
on equity to 15 per cent from 9.4 per cent in the year under review and an
expected 10 per cent in the current financial year.
In response to criticism that Siemens was too heavily focused on maturing
markets, he said world markets offered long-term growth of 5-7 per cent a
year. The group had no great strategic needs such as acquisitions to enter
new markets or fill technological gaps, he added, although spending on
stakes in joint ventures in Asia would increase.
Confirming a 17 per cent fall in profits in the year to September 30 -
although extraordinary gains from disposals bolstered the final figure to
DM1.99bn - Mr von Pierer noted higher productivity had cancelled out the
effects of higher costs and lower selling prices.
In an unusually detailed report on the year just ended, Siemens provided for
the first time a breakdown of earnings by division. This showed, as
expected, falling losses in the Siemens-Nixdorf (SNI) information technology
division and a much-reduced financial result.
The mainstay business in telecommunications equipment and services generated
DM1.12bn in pre-tax profits, while SNI lost DM391m. Power generation and
distribution earned DM104m, the industry division DM119m, transport
equipment DM201m, components DM300m, medical technology DM239m, and Osram
lighting - including the US Sylvania acquisition for the first time -
DM291m. Profits from the energy and industrial products divisions fell
because of lower sales, price pressure and heavy restructuring costs.
Telecommunications earnings were hit by falling demand from east Germany and
price cuts. SNI reduced its loss by an estimated DM100m in spite of
continuing price cuts and high restructuring costs. According to Mr von
Pierer, lower prices cost the group DM2.8bn last year, while restructuring
rose DM800m to DM2.7bn.
Further rationalisation, including the loss of at least 12,000 jobs after
21,000 last year, would incur additional expense, although Mr Karl-Hermann
Baumann, finance director, refused to elaborate. SNI would make its first
operating profit in the current year, he added, although restructuring
charges would mean a further net deficit.
Financial earnings would be about the same as in 1993-94, when they fell to
DM1.3bn from DM1.85bn.

dividend

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bankgesellschaft Berlin, Germany's sixth largest bank, intends to raise its
divided for 1994, Mr Hubertus Moser, co-chairman, said yesterday.
The plan to lift the dividend from last year's DM9 by at least DM1 was
announced as the bank gave details of 10-month results.
The bank was formed through the merger last January of the state-owned
Landesbank Berlin, the private Berliner Bank, and the private Berliner
Hypotheken-und Pfandbriefbank mortgage banks.
The bank's consolidated business volume rose to DM234.5bn (Dollars 147bn)
for the first 10 months of the year, compared with DM222bn during the first
six months of its operations. Real comparative figures on a year-on-year
basis will only be available in 1995.
Consolidated operating results rose to DM999m compared with DM734m from
January to June. After taking into account risk provisions amounting to
DM608m, operating results totalled DM669m.
The risk provisions, which amounted to DM326m during the first half of 1994,
had been increased because of Bankgesellschaft's exposure of DM100m to
Balsam, the sports grounds company which earlier this year ran up large
debts. The bank had a further DM70m of exposure from the collapse of the
Jurgen Schneider property company.

<TEXT>
Rising edible oils prices kept margins under pressure at Acatos &amp; Hutcheson,
the manufacturer of edible oils and fats.
Pre-tax profits for the year to October 2 rose from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds
14.2m. However, the group pointed out that the 40 per cent gain was mainly
the effect of exceptional charges in both years relating to disposals and
restructuring.
Operating profits were flat at Pounds 13.7m, despite a 12 per cent increase
in sales to Pounds 249m (Pounds 222m).
The shares closed 14p ahead at 264p.
In addition to raw material price increases, the group faced increased
competition on prices, citing two other refiners seeking to lift volumes
'with little regard to profit'. The group said it had 'responded as required
to maintain our market share'.
The bulk of the group's business lies in supplying own brand oils and fats
to UK supermarkets; it has about 30 per cent of the market.
Mr Ian Hutcheson, chairman, said earlier this year that the insistence of
some customers that prices should be held in the face of unavoidable cost
increases had 'reached a level of unrealism we have not previously
experienced'.
At the end of September, the group said it was forming a strategic
relationship with Archer Daniels Midland, the US agribusiness group which
supplies its biggest refinery in London's Docklands.
It is also forming a 50-50 joint venture with the US group to build and
operate an edible oil refinery and bottling and canning plant beside ADM's
existing oil seed crushing plant at Erith, Kent.
Mr Hutcheson said yesterday that this, together with other joint ventures
and acquisitions, would 'further improve our competitiveness and I am
increasingly optimistic for the medium to long term once the planned
programme of restructuring and capital expenditure is complete'.
Earnings per share were up from 20.9p to 30.3p. A final dividend of 5.5p is
proposed, taking the total to 9p (8p).

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Allied Radio cuts deficit to Pounds 0.68m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied Radio, which operates licences for Radio Mercury and Mercury Extra in
the south-east and Fortune in Greater Manchester, reduced pre-tax losses
from Pounds 1.46m to Pounds 678,000 for the year to September 30.
The outcome, which included a Pounds 203,000 share of the start-up loss on
Mercury, was achieved on turnover down from Pounds 3.75m to Pounds 2.82m.
Allied underwent a capital restructuring in May, the effect of which was the
elimination of interest charges paid on the convertible unsecured loan
stock, which have been converted into ordinary shares.
Pro-forma losses per share based on shares in issue after the reconstruction
were 0.5p (1.1p).
With some Pounds 2m of cash, the board plans to invest in new and existing
licences.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Murray Johnstone to launch venture trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Murray Johnstone has announced plans to launch one of the new breed of
venture capital trusts, details of which were outlined in the last Budget.
Full details will be published in the Finance Bill next month, but the fund
management group is confident that it will be able to work with the
legislation.
Murray Johnstone plans to launch the trust within the first six months of
next year. It will be managed by Mr Iain Tulloch, its Glasgow-based venture
capital fund manager.
The group will be looking to raise between Pounds 15m and Pounds 30m.
Venture capital trusts will be legally restricted to investing mainly in
very small companies with assets of less than Pounds 10m, which increases
management costs.
However, Murray Johnstone aims to mitigate these by co-investing with other
venture capitalists.
Private investors are to be offered substantial tax breaks for investing in
venture capital trusts at launch. These include 20 per cent up-front income
tax relief on investments of up to Pounds 100,000 a year, tax-free income
and capital gains from the trust if the shares are held for at least five
years, and the possibility of deferring capital gains tax liabilities from
other investments if the gains are rolled into the trusts.

interest took Pounds 1.78m (Pounds 1.5m).
Losses per share of 28.1p this time compared with earnings of 10.9p
previously and there is no dividend. Last year 3p was paid, including a
final of 1.75p.

Smiths Industries, the aerospace and healthcare company, has expanded its
industrial group with two acquisitions in continental Europe.
The acquisitions - Sodiamex of France and Interplas, a Switzerland-based
company with operations in Italy, Spain and the UK - will be absorbed into
Smith's Flex-Tek ducting and conduit business.
Consideration for the purchases is Pounds 13.3m cash, with assumed
borrowings of about Pounds 5m.
Interplas, which specialises in suction and discharge hose for a range of
industrial activities as well as electrical conduit, is being acquired from
Walter Meier Holding, a Swiss public company. Sodiamex is a privately-owned
company specialising in ventilation ducting.
The total net assets of the two companies at the date of acquisition amount
to some Pounds 10m and operating profits for 1994 are estimated at Pounds
2.3m.

interest cost
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greencore, the sugar, malting and milling group, reported a 17 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits from IPounds 33.7m to IPounds 39.5m (Pounds
38.9m) for the year to September 30, reflecting a sharp reduction in net
interest costs and further efficiency gains.
Sugar, agribusiness and other food operations all recorded increases in
profits. Only the malting business suffered a fall, reflecting difficult
marketing conditions and high domestic barley prices in 1993.
Group sales increased to IPounds 404.5m (IPounds 393.8m) including IPounds
175,000 (IPounds 1.46m) from discontinued activities giving an underlying
rise of 3 per cent.
This in part reflected a fall in sugar sales, following poor crop yields in
1993. Retail sugar demand, about 25 per cent of total sugar volume, showed a
small decline in a difficult market.
Mr Bernie Cahill, chairman, said agribusiness was responding well to reforms
of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. He welcomed the agreed reduction in
'set aside' - the land farmers are required to take out of production - from
15 per cent to 12 per cent, which would result in increased processing
volumes.
He added that the outlook for the Irish and Belgian malt businesses was
improving on the back of the upturn in the beer and spirits markets. Flour
and consumer food operations increased volumes, particularly exports.
Interest costs were cut by IPounds 5m to IPounds 4.26m, underlining
continued strong cash flow and reduced working capital requirements.
Earnings per share increased 13 per cent to 38.4p (33.9p) and a final
dividend of 6.2p is proposed for a total of 9.9p (8.8p).

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: GWR seeks easing of growth limit as profits
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GWR, the Bristol-based commercial radio group, yesterday renewed its appeal
to the government to relax the restrictions on station ownership.
Mr Ralph Barnard, chief executive, attacked what he called 'the ludicrous
anomaly' preventing GWR from expanding because it had the maximum 20
licences even though together they reach only 8m people. Other radio
companies, with fewer but larger licences, could reach 16m to 17m people.
'We are being forced abroad by this. We would much rather spend our energies
and our money in the UK,' said Mr Barnard, who expressed surprise at how
long it was taking the government to deal with what appeared to be a simple
issue.
He was speaking after the group announced trebled pre-tax profits of Pounds
3.1m (Pounds 900,000) for the year to September 30 on turnover more than
doubled at Pounds 21.7m.
Earnings per share came out at 38.4p (18.4p) and a proposed final dividend
of 7.5p makes a total of 13p (9p).
During the year acquisitions increased GWR's potential audience from 3m to
8m with the addition of stations such as Radio Trent in Nottingham and Derby
and the Mid Anglia group with stations in Peterborough, Cambridge and Kings
Lynn.
The acquisitions accounted for Pounds 1.1m of total operating profit of
Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 1m). The results did not include any contribution from
GWR's 17 per cent stake in Classic FM which is not yet paying a dividend.
Mr Henry Meakin, chairman, said that the present year had begun well 'with
revenues ahead of budget and strongly ahead of last year'.
James Capel, GWR's broker, yesterday raised its forecast for the current
year from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 4.5m.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: LMS gains 30% with aid of property sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Merchant Securities, the property and investment company, reported a
30 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds
13.1m, helped by gains on the disposal of investment properties.
Net rental income improved from Pounds 14.8m to Pounds 15.7m in the six
months to the end of September, partly offset by a 25 per cent rise in
administrative costs to Pounds 2.6m. The company said these expenses
included the cost of its High Court action against shareholders in BSB
Holdings, the old British Satellite Broadcasting holding company which owns
14 per cent of BSkyB.
LMS claims the terms under which it was offered shares during BSB's 1991
rights issue were unfair. The case should come to trial in January.
The company's 5 per cent holding in BSB Holdings remains valued at nil in
the balance sheet despite the recent flotation of BSkyB.
Dividends received from First Leisure Corporation, the leisure company in
which LMS has a 14.6 per cent stake, contributed other income of Pounds
632,000 (Pounds 596,000).
Profits from the sale of investment properties were Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 2m)
and included proceeds from the disposal of assets held jointly with General
Accident, the insurance company. LMS said GA remained a large shareholder
and that opportunities for collaboration in new ventures were being
explored.
Earnings per share, including capital items, rose from 2.31p to 4.27p, but
fell from 1.97p to 1.48p on revenue profit alone. The interim dividend is
unchanged at 0.8p.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: A change of focus for ASW - Package marks
further rationalisation of European steel industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASW Holdings yesterday announced a clean break with its past by swapping its
Scunthorpe rod mill business for British Steel's 35.2 per cent stake in ASW,
the Cardiff-based steel and construction products group.
The transaction is part of a complex package of deals which mark a further
rationalisation of ownership in the European steel industry and give ASW its
first steel plants in continental Europe.
They include a 7-for-20 rights issue at ASW, to raise about Pounds 29m after
expenses, priced at 160p and payable in two instalments. It has been fully
underwritten by SG Warburg.
Other details of the package are:
The disposal by ASW of the Scunthorpe mill to British Steel in effective
exchange for the repurchase of 13.4m ordinary shares (20 per cent of ASW's
ordinary shares) and 30.8m Pounds 1 cumulative convertible preference
shares.
The stake held by British Steel dates back to the flotation of ASW in 1988.
British Steel said the consideration for the rod mill of Pounds 50m broadly
equates to the book value of its shareholding in ASW.
ASW will acquire for about Pounds 51m an 80 per cent stake in Societe Des
Aciers D'Armature Pour Le Beton (SAM), the steel mesh and reinforcement coil
(recoil) unit of Usinor Sacilor.
ASW will pay Pounds 32m cash and issue 10m new shares to Usinor, giving the
French group a stake of about 12 per cent in ASW. The Cardiff-based company
will, in certain circumstances, buy the rest of SAM for up to Pounds 19m
cash.
ASW will invest Pounds 17m in its Cardiff rod mill, to produce all its
present reinforcement bar (rebar) - now produced at Tremorfa bar mill - and
recoil in one operation. A related Pounds 2.1m restructuring charge is
expected for next year.
Sir Alan Cox, ASW's chief executive, said that, in looking for a better
ownership structure in the industry, it was inevitable to question whether
wire rod was a strategic business for ASW. It retains a small wire rod
operation in Cardiff.
British Steel already supplies steel billet to the Scunthorpe mill, which is
on the same site as its main Scunthorpe works and employs about 320 people.
It will be run as one business with British Steel's Templeborough rolling
mill in Rotherham.
Sir Alan said the SAM acquisition would turn ASW into 'a genuine company in
the European sense'. SAM had group sales of FFr2.32bn (Pounds 270m) last
year, and is forecasting sharply higher profits this year. It has already
been extensively restructured, but Sir Alan said there was considerable
scope for improving its operational cash flow.
ASW shares rose 20p to 215p yesterday. Because the shares held by British
Steel will be cancelled, The number of ASW shares outstanding will be
reduced from 83m to 82.6m even after the rights issue.
The directors said the transactions would enhance earnings per share in 1995
and forecast an unchanged 3p final for 1994, making 6p for the year.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Rejuvenated balance sheet behind recovery
at YJ Lovell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in YJ Lovell (Holdings) gained 7p to 60p yesterday after news that
its financial restructuring had returned the builder and property developer
to the black.
The turnround from losses of Pounds 59.6m to a pre-tax profit of Pounds
4.16m for the year to September was achieved on the back of a rejuvenated
balance sheet, which strengthened from a net liability position of Pounds
13.3m to show net assets of Pounds 62.2m.
The first dividend for three years is declared at 1p, on earnings per share
rose of 9.4p (712.3p restated loss).
Growth in all of the core businesses of construction, residential housing
and plant hire helped lift sales to Pounds 251m (Pounds 224m).
The restructuring package, agreed with a syndicate of banks last December,
injected Pounds 75.5m into the balance sheet through a Pounds 45.8m
debt-to-equity swap and a Pounds 29.7m rights issue.
The money was used in a substantial write-down of property and land in the
US and the UK's commercial property divisions and residential housing in
Spain. There was also fresh capital investment in the Plant Hire company -
which enjoyed windfall profits of Pounds 800,000 against a Pounds 1.7m loss
 -and in the residential business in the US and UK.
Group net debt was reduced from Pounds 94.2m to Pounds 25.5m, resulting in
on balance sheet gearing of 41 per cent.
Mr Bob Sellier, chief executive, said: 'Our order books are looking healthy
and we will continue to consolidate or discontinue our weaker businesses.'
The only area where profits fell was the Partnership division, which
provides social housing in conjunction with the UK's Housing Association.
Pre-tax profits fell 17 per cent to Pounds 2.9m, due to reduced sales and
government funding for social housing, said Mr Sellier.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Apollo back in the black with Pounds
291,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apollo Metals swung back into profit during its second half to finish the
year to September 30 with pre-tax profits of Pounds 291,000, against Pounds
1.02m last time, writes Paul Cheeseright.
The company incurred a first-half loss of Pounds 219,000.
The outcome was slightly higher than the forecast made in October when the
aluminium and specialist steel distributor and processor launched a Pounds
7.79m rights issue to finance the acquisition of Aviation Metals.
Turnover rose from Pounds 28.2m to Pounds 33.7m, but after meeting
reorganisation costs in Germany, operating profits fell from Pounds 1.42m to
Pounds 564,000.
Although earnings per share were nil, against 5p, the group is confident
enough of trading prospects to hold the final dividend at 2.4p, maintaining
the total at 3.6p.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: CTR cuts loss to Pounds 7.2m as
exceptionals plummet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses at Central Transport Rental Group, formerly Tiphook, fell sharply in
the six months to October 31, declining from Pounds 179.7m to Pounds 7.2m,
as the company reported lower exceptional charges and an improvement in
trading.
The interest charge was halved at Pounds 20.6m (Pounds 40.6m) and the
results were additionally flattered by a Pounds 19.3m foreign currency gain
on its US bonds.
Mr Ian Clubb, the non-executive chairman who joined the board three months
ago, said the results marked a turning point in the group's fortunes.
In the past year, CTR has parted with several directors, run up hefty
losses, been forced to sell its container leasing division and had the
ignominy of its chief executive, Mr Robert Montague, facing bankruptcy
charges.
Turnover fell to Pounds 73.4m (Pounds 155.7m) for operating losses of Pounds
2.2m (Pounds 139.1m). However, the company said continuing operations showed
turnover ahead 8.5 per cent for operating profits of Pounds 9m, compared
with losses Pounds 2.4m.
Losses per share fell from 163.4p to 6.5p.
Sales in the trailer rental division improved by 9 per cent to Pounds 67.1m
as it pushed through rental rises of 3.4 per cent. Utilisation rates also
improved. In the rail wagon rental business, turnover rose Pounds 200,000 to
Pounds 6m.
Exceptional charges fell from Pounds 154.6m to Pounds 14.9m. This included
Pounds 2.2m in redundancy and reorganisation costs. CTR relocates this
weekend from its prestigious central London address to smaller premises in
High Wycombe with a central office staff of 30, a tenth of the figure
employed at its peak. Administrative expenses over the half declined from
Pounds 49.4m to Pounds 22.9m.
Mr Clubb said that with a four-year agreement with its bankers only recently
begun, the group had enough working capital to continue its operations and
maintain capital investment. A financial reconstruction was planned at some
stage, probably during 1995.
However, a contract with Schmitz, a German manufacturer of trailers with
which CTR has a long-term supply contract, was not provided for. The
contract would cost the group Pounds 161m over the next five years, with the
next payment of Pounds 18m due in April 1997.
'With our improving cash flow and market position, I don't see this being a
problem at all,' said Mr Clubb.
He reiterated the board's view that the personal finances of Mr Montague,
who has two bankruptcy writs outstanding and reputed debts of some Pounds
40m, were his affair. 'But he would not be working for us if he did not add
value,' he added.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Dobson Park raises Pounds 18m and buys rest
of Longwall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dobson Park Industries is making a recommended offer for the outstanding
41.1 per cent holding in Longwall International, it mining equipment
associate. It proposes to part fund the deal with a 1-for-4 rights issue at
62p to raise Pounds 17.7m net.
The shares eased 3p to 75p.
At the same time, the mining equipment, industrial electronics and toys
group revealed pre-tax profits more than doubled for the year to October 1.
Profits leapt to Pounds 10.5m pre-tax, at the top end of expectations. The
comparable Pounds 4.16m was struck after a Pounds 4.59m loss from the
disposal of the Power Tools and Revere Aerospace. Adjusted for the effect of
the disposals profits rose 20 per cent.
Turnover fell to Pounds 100m, including Pounds 4.47m from acquisitions,
against Pounds 123.4m, including Pounds 28.9m from discontinued activities.
Underlying turnover showed an increase of 6 per cent.
Earnings rose from 1.42p, or 4.65p adjusted, to 5.45p and the final dividend
is held at 2.55p for an unchanged total 3.75p.
Mr Alan Kaye, chairman, said the dividend could not be raised because of
bank covenants connected with the Longwall joint venture.
In January 1993 Dobson merged its mining equipment interests with Meco
International, a 1989 buy-out from Dowty, into Longwall. Dobson held 50 per
cent of the shares and 35 per cent of the votes. In September 1993, it
bought Westpac's 8.9 per cent stake for Pounds 2m, though the 12 per cent of
the votes could not be utilised until either Dobson made a general offer or
Longwall was floated.
Dobson reduced its dividend payments when Longwall was set up as the joint
venture had no cash flow, being laden with borrowings dating from the mbo.
Dobson is assuming the borrowings, which, at November 18, stood at Pounds
23.5m. Indeed Mr Kaye said Dobson wanted Longwall 'to score' by refinancing
it 'in a plc-type way'.
Dobson is offering Pounds 18.4m in cash with an alternative comprising an
initial cash payment of Pounds 16.4m and a performance-related payment of up
to Pounds 11.6m, linked to profit and cash generated over three years.
Mr Kaye said that Longwall's management, holding 25.8 per cent of the shares
and 41.6 per cent of the voting rights had accepted and opted for the
performance related alternative. That enables Dobson to speak for 84.7 per
cent of the shares and 88.5 per cent of the voting rights.
Group operating profits fell to Pounds 5.78m (Pounds 6.58m), though the
associates - Longwall and Instem - contributed a further Pounds 4.79m
(Pounds 2.95m).
The industrial electronics side lifted pre-interest profits to Pounds 4.72m
(Pounds 3.95m); mining equipment rose to Pounds 5.01m (Pounds 4.48m); toys
and plastics advanced to Pounds 1.63m (Pounds 1.38m); and a property sale
brought in Pounds 448,000 (Pounds 39,000).

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Record revenues behind 43% leap at Daily
Mail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail and the Evening
Standard, produced record revenues and trading profits despite the newspaper
price cutting wars.
The performance of its newspapers, with both Daily Mail and Evening Standard
classified advertising particularly strong, helped the Daily Mail and
General Trust to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 92.1m in the year to October 2 -
a 43 per cent rise on the previous Pounds 64.4m.
Trading profit increased 18 per cent to Pounds 97.6m. The pre-tax result was
after exceptional losses of Pounds 16.1m for provisions set against
investments in the Whittle partnerships in the US, but included a Pounds
15.9m surplus from Euromoney's Pounds 23.1m placing of shares to
institutions in May. Although DMGT sold no shares, its Euromoney stake fell
from 74.7 per cent to 70.3 per cent.
Earnings per share were 58.9p (46.8p). The company recommended a final
dividend of 12.5p (adjusted 11.2p) making a total of 16.5p (adjusted 14.8p).
Mr Peter Williams, finance director, said yesterday that DMGT was delighted
by the performance of the main group newspapers. 'It's almost a surprise to
ourselves.'
Advertising revenue rose by 14 per cent and there was also a 'sharp increase
in profit' at Northcliffe Newspapers, the regional group.
The board, led by Lord Rothermere, did, however, warn that while the group's
UK businesses continued to experience improving advertising markets, the
national newspaper sales market continued to be very competitive and a sharp
increase in newsprint prices was expected.
Mr David Forster, media analyst at Smith New Court, the stockbrokers, said
DMGT had produced 'a really rather good set of results'. Smith New Court was
now looking for profits of Pounds 103m and 62.3p earnings in the current
year and Pounds 124m profits and 75.8p earnings in 1995-96.
Other ventures such as Channel One, the London News Channel and Collegeview,
a US-based information service for college leavers, remained in loss because
of start-up costs.
Associates such as Teletext, Westcountry, the ITV company, the GWR
commercial radio group and the Bristol Evening Post all had improved
results.
The purchase of the Nottingham Evening Post is due to be completed in
January.
DMGT A shares slipped 2p to 978p.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: ICI sells Teesside plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imperial Chemical Industries confirmed yesterday that it is to sell its
ethylene oxide derivatives businesses to Union Carbide, the US chemicals
group.
Under the Pounds 40m deal, Union Carbide will acquire and operate ICI's
ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol production plant at Wilton, on Teesside.
The 90 employees will transfer to Union Carbide.
The deal, signed early yesterday, is subject to review by the Office of Fair
Trading, but is expected to be completed within three months.
ICI was keen to stress the differences between this latest divestment and
its 1993 swap deal with Du Pont. Du Pont has since angered the Teesside
community, and embarrassed ICI, by announcing heavy job losses at the nylon
plants which it acquired there.
Mr Arthur Dicken, ICI's Teesside operations manager, said: 'There are two
big differences, the mutual dependence to supply each other and the very
firm plans to invest.'
Under the agreement ICI will supply Union Carbide with ethylene for the
Wilton site, and buy 45 per cent of its output of ethylene oxide, a key raw
material for a number of its businesses.
The two companies have agreed to fund jointly the expansion of the ethylene
oxide unit at Wilton from 240,000 tonnes a year capacity to 300,000 tonnes.
Union Carbide also intends to increase Wilton's ethylene glycol capacity
from 85,000 to 200,000 tonnes a year and may expand other facilities.
Mr Mike Brider, Teesside district secretary of the Transport and General
Workers' Union, said the unions would seek assurances that Union Carbide
would maintain union recognition and ICI employment terms and conditions.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals propel Alvis ahead to Pounds
5.83m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exceptional profits of Pounds 2.52m helped Alvis, the defence contractor,
lift pre-tax profits by 15 per cent in the year to September 30.
The upturn from Pounds 5.07m to Pounds 5.83m was achieved despite an 18 per
cent fall in turnover to Pounds 80m (Pounds 97.3m), resulting from weak
order books in several subsidiaries.
The sale of Alvis's 11.2 per cent stake in Avimo Singapore, coupled with the
disposal of Alvis UAV Engines, resulted in exceptional gains of Pounds
4.23m. However, the group also took a charge of Pounds 1.7m for redundancy
and restructuring costs.
Operating profit from continuing operations dropped from Pounds 5m to Pounds
43,000 on sales 31 per cent lower at Pounds 67.1m.
Profits at Alvis Industries fell from Pounds 1.89m to Pounds 1.28m, after
losses at Alvis Vehicles and Alvis Aerospace and Transmissions.
Mr Nick Prest, chief executive, said: 'We are reasonably confident that
Alvis Vehicles will get some substantial orders this year, which is very
important for the profitability of the group.'
Unipower, the manufacturer of specialist military vehicles acquired in
February, did not make a substantial contribution to profitability, but is
expected to next year. The goodwill write-off from the acquisition is Pounds
3m higher than was then expected at Pounds 9.42m.
Avimo Singapore's contribution to profits fell from Pounds 6.57m to Pounds
3.26m because of poor results at its Asian operations. Avimo Alvis
Aerospace, which makes castings and mechanical components, incurred a
substantial loss.
Helio, the maker of periscopes and equipment for fighting vehicles, and Arab
International Optronics both performed well.
Earnings per share emerged at 2.5p (2.4p) and an unchanged final dividend of
0.5p is proposed maintaining the total for the year at 1p.
The shares closed down 1p at 41p.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: M&amp;G rises 20% despite difficult markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
M&amp;G Group, the independent unit trust company that stresses the importance
of high dividends, yesterday lifted its total pay-out for the year by 20 per
cent to 30p, matching the rise in earnings.
The board is recommending a final dividend of 17p (15p), to be paid from
earnings of 57.5p (47.8p) per share.
Pre-tax profits for the year ended September rose by 20 per cent from Pounds
50.9m to Pounds 61m. Funds under management grew by nearly 12 per cent to
Pounds 11.8bn (Pounds 10.6bn) - a record net inflow.
'We are extremely pleased with 20 per cent growth,' said Mr David Watson,
finance director, given that the markets had been difficult. The FT-SE-A
All-Share Index at the end of September was at an almost identical level to
the previous year.
Over five to 10 years 94 per cent of the group's unit trusts were in the
first and second quartile. 'We continue to offer above average investment
performance,' said Mr Watson. 'We treasure this highly.'
Unit trust sales more than doubled to Pounds 899m (Pounds 414m) and net of
redemptions jumped from Pounds 27m to Pounds 527m. The group's share of the
market for unit trust Pep sales grew from 9.1 per cent to 10.2 per cent,
helped by the removal of the initial charge on the Managed Income Fund Pep
in January.
Single premium life sales were 81 per cent higher at Pounds 237m (Pounds
131m). From January sellers of life insurance will have to disclose the cost
of management fees, and overall sales are expected to dip. But Mr Watson
said M&amp;G was well placed to win extra business as it was among the lowest
charging companies.
Net asset value per share rose from 196.5p to 216.3p. The shares rose by 3p
yesterday, closing at 940p.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Trafalgar House cuts charges - Lower
provision of Pounds 24m for further rationalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar House, the engineering and property conglomerate, has returned to
profit after three years of losses, helped by a sharp fall in provisions and
the cost cutting carried out since Hongkong Land took effective control last
year.
About 2,000 jobs have been cut from the engineering division in the past
year, reducing costs by about Pounds 30m.
Yesterday the group announced a further Pounds 24m of provisions for
additional rationalisation and redundancies. These will fall mainly in the
engineering division in the UK and Europe.
Engineering profits fell to Pounds 43.7m (Pounds 77.2m) on turnover of
Pounds 2.23bn (Pounds 2.25bn) in the year to September 30. Group operating
profits before exceptionals rose to Pounds 93.6m (Pounds 91.1m).
Mr Nigel Rich, chief executive, said engineering margins had continued to
fall as the division worked through contracts won during the recession. He
warned engineering profits could fall further this year before margins
recovered. The order book had remained fairly constant at about Pounds 2bn.
'There has been a pick up in the steel industry and petrochemicals and we
are getting a lot more work coming out of Asia.'
After total exceptional debits of Pounds 24.1m, Trafalgar recorded a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 45.6m. A debit of Pounds 396.7m in the previous year
resulted in a loss of Pounds 347m.
Mr Gavin Launder, conglomerates analyst at Goldman Sachs, described the
results as 'quite encouraging' but left his current year forecast unchanged
at Pounds 99m. He reduced his earnings per share forecast from 4.5p to 4p.
A sharply reduced interest bill of Pounds 23.9m (Pounds 41.4m) followed the
Pounds 400m convertible share issue a year ago, which left Trafalgar with
gearing of just 3 per cent at its year end on shareholders' funds of Pounds
708.6m.
Operating profits from construction were little changed at Pounds 13.1m
(Pounds 12.5m) and there was a strong recovery in housebuilding, where
profits jumped to Pounds 19m (Pounds 6.1m).
Analysts were encouraged by the Pounds 500,000 underlying profit from
commercial property - compared with a Pounds 15.4m loss - but the company
said the flat contribution of Pounds 7.8m from shipping was disappointing.
The mass of exceptional items included property write-backs of Pounds 5.8m -
after write-downs of Pounds 178m the previous year - and a Pounds 15m
provision for environmental risks related to a site in the US.
Earnings per share were 1.1p (47.6p loss) and Trafalgar is paying a final
dividend of 1p, after passing the interim, as predicted a year ago.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Turnround takes ERF to Pounds 0.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recovery in the UK truck market and some non-European export markets helped
produce a pre-tax profit of Pounds 801,000 at ERF (Holdings) in the six
months to October 1, against a Pounds 613,000 loss in the comparable period.
The turnround follows accumulated losses of more than Pounds 9m in the
previous four years, when ERF and all other truck makers suffered from the
most severe European market slump on record.
In the second half of last year ERF made Pounds 453,000 - not enough to
prevent a loss of Pounds 26,000 for the year as a whole.
In the current half-year gearing fell to 41.9 per cent, against 63.5 per
cent at the end of the previous year.
Turnover rose 37 per cent to Pounds 91.8m (Pounds 66.9m).
An interim dividend of 2p (nil) is payable from earnings per share of 4.6p
(7.53p loss).
UK sales were 25 per cent higher, but those to export markets, particularly
South Africa, jumped by 95 per cent. ERF's 43.9 per cent stake in ERF South
Africa earned it Pounds 109,000 (Pounds 78,000).
Mr Peter Foden, chairman, said he regarded South Africa as a major potential
growth area.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Plysu declines to Pounds 2.85m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plysu, the plastic container manufacturer, expects to pay at least an
unchanged dividend this year, despite the adverse effect which sharply
higher raw material prices will have on profits.
Mr David O'Shaughnessy, chairman, who was announcing a 16 per cent fall in
interim profits, said progress in cutting costs and increasing volumes had
been overshadowed by rises in polymer prices of more than 75 per cent. This
represented cost increases of Pounds 1.5m a month across all of Plysu's
businesses.
The full effect of the increases would be felt in the second half. However,
Mr O'Shaughnessy said Plysu would be able to pass through all the price
increases, although that would take time.
The drop in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 3.41m to Pounds 2.85m, for the six
months to September 30 was on sales 2 per cent higher at Pounds 44.7m.
Mr O'Shaughnessy said profits were lower because of both the impact of
higher raw material prices and the negotiation of longer-term contracts with
the dairy companies.
However, with the restructuring announced last year about Pounds 1m in
annualised costs had been cut out of the UK containers business, and Pounds
750,000 from the continental European operation. The underlying trading
position was also improving, he said, with volumes in the juice and dairy
containers business at record levels.
Plysu maintained the interim dividend at 2p. Earnings per share fell from
4.8p to 4p.

2.66m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold Greenlees Trott, the advertising and marketing services group, reported
pre-tax profits up 19 per cent from Pounds 2.24m to Pounds 2.66m in the six
months to October 31.
Turnover increased 13 per cent from Pounds 127.8m to Pounds 143.8m and group
revenue grew 9 per cent from Pounds 25.8m to Pounds 28m. Operating profits
rose by 11 per cent to Pounds 3.16m.
Earnings per share were up from 6.2p to 7.16p. The interim dividend is 2p
(3.3p) with the balance of interim and final adjusted to reflect the group's
previous practice.
Net interest costs fell by 18 per cent to Pounds 507,000, reflecting reduced
long-term borrowings.
The results represented the best overall performance for some time, said Mr
Michael Greenlees, chairman. This was largely achieved as a result of
improvements in UK oper-ations, in particular of GGT Direct and GGT
Advertising.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Improved beer sales volumes help Greene
King to Pounds 10.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greene King yesterday announced its first improvement in beer sales volume
in three years as it reported a 12 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits
from Pounds 9.49m to Pounds 10.7m. Turnover rose from a restated Pounds
72.8m to Pounds 77.5m.
Most of the growth came from managed pubs, which sold 16 per cent more beer,
partly reflecting additional houses purchased from Bass. Their sales and
operating profits rose by 19 per cent. Volumes sold to the free trade and
national accounts dipped slightly, leaving overall volume up 0.2 per cent at
410,000 barrels.
The second half had started well with beer volumes and food and drink from
managed pubs showing further growth, said Mr Timothy Bridge, chief
executive. Consumer confidence remained fragile, however, particularly in
East Anglia, the group's home market.
Underlying profits growth was 8 per cent, excluding reorganisation costs of
Pounds 1.02m (Pounds 336,000) and a Pounds 763,000 gain on disposal of
investments, mostly the profit on the sale of the 29 per cent stake in
Morland, the Thames Valley brewer.
The Pounds 29m proceeds helped cut net debt from Pounds 100.6m to Pounds
69.2m and gearing from 43 per cent to 28 per cent.
Greene King continues to look for new pub sites in densely populated areas,
typically to the south and south-east of its home base. It hopes to open
about seven new pubs this year; so far it has opened one in Crawley and one
in Oxford.
The interim dividend is 4.1p, up 6.5 per cent. Earnings per share were 19p
(16.1p) before exceptionals and 17.2p (16.4p) after.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Devanha for market via reverse takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Devanha, the cable television company, is coming to market by reversing into
Worth Investment Trust, which has made a Pounds 24m recommended bid for the
company.
The offer takes the form of 24.628468 new shares in Worth, with one warrant
for every five shares, for each Devanha ordinary share. The Pounds 24m
valuation is based on the 20.5p asset value of existing Worth shares, with a
2p premium. Worth shares were suspended yesterday at 24p.
The new shares will represent 79 per cent of the share capital of the
enlarged company, to be named Caledonian Media Communications.
Marshall Securities is to place 20.5m of the new shares, 17.5 per cent of
the total. Directors and shareholders in Devanha have given irrevocable
undertakings to accept the offer in respect of 90.8 per cent of the shares.
The proposals will be put to an extraordinary meeting on January 9. Dealings
in the new shares and warrants are due to start on January 10.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Chrysalis considers options on distribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chrysalis, the music and media group, is considering the possibility of
joining a consortium bidding for the Channel 5 franchise or launching a
channel for cable or satellite television.
'Channel 5 is not the only method of distribution,' said Mr Chris Wright,
chairman of Chrysalis, which will make 3,000 hours of television this year.
The company, which yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.39m for
the year to August 31 on turnover from continuing operations up from Pounds
59m to Pounds 68.9m, has not yet decided which option to choose. However, it
is keen to keep its status as an independent producer.
The pre-tax loss of Pounds 14.6m the previous year included a provision of
Pounds 11.1m against losses on the closure of discontinued businesses such
as the MAM Leisure amusement machine operation. The 1994 results reflect a
credit of Pounds 1.5m released from the provision.
Losses per share were 11.06p (34.44p).
Mr Wright, a significant shareholder in Chrysalis, said that 'excellent
progress' had been made in refocusing the company on the multi-media
entertainment industry.
'As anticipated, the extensive investment that this has necessitated has
impacted on short-term profitability but I am confident that our long-term
goal of a substantial enhancement of shareholder value will be achieved.'
Chrysalis has decided not to pay a dividend for the year and it is clear
that the start-up costs of Crystal FM, the new commercial radio licence for
London won against intense competition, is likely to be enough to keep the
company in loss in the current financial year.
Chrysalis, and probably its shareholders, will expect the company to move
into profit in 1995-96. At present shareholders' funds stand at Pounds 45m.
The shares closed unchanged at 245p.

FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Sweb dismisses merger speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Western Electricity dismissed speculation that it could become
involved in a merger or takeover as it reported a 35 per cent increase in
interim pre-tax profits and a 24 per cent dividend rise.
Mr John Seed, chief executive, said there had been no noticeable changes in
its shareholders' register. 'We are not in discussions with anyone and it is
our intention to remain independent,' he said.
As one of the smaller regional electricity companies, Sweb has been
identified by investors as one of the most likely bid targets after Northern
Electric. Trafalgar House announced this week that it was considering a bid
for Northern.
In the six months to September 30, Sweb made pre-tax profits of Pounds 41.4m
(Pounds 30.6m) on turnover of Pounds 374.1m (Pounds 385.8m). The interim
dividend of 8.7p (7p) is being paid from earnings of 25.6p (19.9p).
Sweb said the underlying increase in the dividend was 18.6 per cent but the
amount per share had increased further by the buy-back of 5.1 per cent of
its shares.
Sweb has authority to buy back up to 10 per cent and Mr Seed said the
company would choose an appropriate moment to complete the programme.
If it did so, gearing by the year-end would be about 20 per cent, assuming
no other significant changes.
Distribution unit sales increased by 2.6 per cent on a weather-adjusted
basis, helping to increase profits from Pounds 26.6m to Pounds 36.7m. The
supply business incurred a loss of Pounds 2.5m against a profit of Pounds
3.2m in the comparable period.
Mr Seed said Sweb aimed to cut Pounds 27m from the cost basis over the next
five years, with most of the reductions in the first two. About Pounds 18m
of this would come from improving operation efficiency. Electricity business
staff is scheduled to fall from 2,900 to 2,400 by the end of the century.
Retailing halved its loss to Pounds 500,000. Mr Seed said that if the
company could 'find an opportunity to make an elegant exit from retailing we
would take it'.
Sweb intends to demerge its full holding in the National Grid if flotation
goes ahead.
COMMENT
There were two schools of thought on Sweb in the City yesterday. Some
analysts argue that it is a good bet because it enjoyed a favourable
regulatory review; others see it as being in danger of being penalised by
investors for moving too slowly on cost-cutting, particularly jobs. But in
these heady days evaluation of electricity companies has as much to do with
the likelihood of them becoming bid targets as with their underlying
performance. That is why Sweb's rating is higher than most. Its shares are
trading on a yield of 4.2 per cent, assuming a 29p full-year dividend.

Kunick, the leisure group which floated its UK nursing homes business
earlier this year, is to pay its first dividend for three years after
announcing an 86 per cent increase in annual profits.
The proposed dividend is 0.5p. Turnover for the 53 weeks to September 30 was
flat at Pounds 95.2m (Pounds 94.1m) but pre-tax profits jumped to Pounds
8.98m (Pounds 4.84m). Earnings per share, after exceptional items, were
0.82p (0.13p).
Operating profit on continuing operations was up 28 per cent at Pounds 7.66m
(Pounds 6m).
The leisure division increased operating profit by 27 per cent to Pounds
5.65m (Pounds 4.43m) after an efficiency programme at Bell Fruit Services
and the successful introduction of AWP machines, which issue prizes such as
watches. Four new entertainment centres for the 18-30 age group will be
opened in 1995.

FT  16 DEC 94 / SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley: Warburg is left in the lurch
 -The problems that dogged the proposed merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse of the merger talks between Morgan Stanley and SG Warburg is an
unfortunate Christmas present for both sides. It questions not only whether
they should have foreseen the obstacles, but whether Warburg can recover its
poise as an independent investment bank.
In the aftermath of yesterday's statements, some Warburg employees
questioned whether senior executives, including Lord Cairns, its chief
executive, should resign. Yet whether they stay or go, Warburg will find it
harder than before to maintain the argument for its independence.
The collapse of the talks was sudden, and happened after Mercury Asset
Management's board and some of its senior fund managers started to digest
the implications of the deal. Fund managers were concerned to protect their
independence, while directors wanted to ensure shareholders were not
disadvantaged.
MAM's board, led by Mr Hugh Stevenson, its chairman, brought in Lazard
Brothers, the merchant bank, to advise on the deal after it was made public.
The most obvious question was how MAM's minority shareholders - who own the
25 per cent of its equity not held by Warburg - would be treated.
The problem was that the merger offer appeared to value Warburg's equity
below its market price, implying that MAM was not being fairly valued. Mr
Philip Gibbs, analyst at BZW, estimates that at Dollars 60 per Morgan
Stanley share, the implied valuation of Warburg was Pounds 1.53bn, or 695p
per share.
This was well below yesterday's opening price of 798p. Mr Gibbs says that
applying a price earnings ratio to MAM similar to other US fund management
acquisitions, and giving a premium for Warburg's investment banking
business, a takeover bid ought to value the group at 950p per share.
Such calculations made MAM call for what it yesterday termed 'an appropriate
offer' for minority shareholders, so giving them a chance to exit at what
seemed a fairer price.
Although Morgan Stanley did not want to pay too much, its executives were
prepared to accept some premium.
One senior Morgan Stanley executive says that gaining control of MAM was
'the principal attraction' of the merger because the US firm wanted to gain
a stabilising influence on its earnings. The merger gave it a chance to
acquire MAM at a lower price than it would pay for a US fund management
business.
Morgan Stanley executives believe the gap between the premium MAM wanted to
pay to minority shareholders, and its own suggestion, was bridgeable. 'We
were perfectly prepared to recognise that retiring it (the minority stake)
would have resulted in a premium,' says one.
But another problem was dogging the proposed merger of MAM and Morgan
Stanley's fund management arm. MAM fund managers who were told of the merger
last week wanted to keep independence from Morgan Stanley's operations. This
became the main point at issue at a meeting in London on Tuesday.
'It turned out we had a different view. We believed that the businesses
could be brought together over time - it wasn't a case of jamming them
together next week,' says one senior Morgan Stanley executive. The US firm
thought that unless the operations were brought together - for example in
technology and marketing - the point of the merger was lost.
The negotiations ran into other problems, and while Warburg executives do
not believe these were likely to be insuperable, they could have been big
enough to block a deal - even without the asset management complications.
One difficulty was that the two investment banks were having problems
deciding how businesses would be run. Although senior executives had an
outline view before the deal was made public, there was still some tough
bargaining to be done among more junior managers over who would have
control.
Both banks are adamant that there were no 'black holes' discovered in the
due diligence process that made either bank nervous about linking with the
other. Indeed, some Warburg executives claim they were reassured by the view
Morgan Stanley took of the strengths of their business.
The collapse of the deal leaves questions facing both banks, given their
rhetoric about the reason for linking together. If they will no longer be
able to combine to form the strongest global investment bank, how seriously
can they claim to be global players if they now remain independent?
The questions are loudest for Warburg, whose shareholders would have taken a
third of the equity in the new holding company. The bank was seen to have
tacitly admitted that it could not achieve global scale by itself, and had
failed to penetrate the US securities market seriously.
Warburg's executives were yesterday arguing that this was a logical fallacy.
They believed that they would have achieved a leap of five years in their
strategy through the merger. They now think that they can simply resume
their previous strategy of independent growth, accepting slower expansion.
Yet this reasoning did not cut much ice yesterday within Warburg's London
offices yesterday, where the collapse led to an angry inquest. 'I think the
merger was driven by two things: panic by people on the board who don't
understand this business, and greed,' said one Warburg employee.
Some Warburg employees said the handling of the deal had exposed weaknesses
in the bank's management. 'There's a lack of confidence in the people in top
management,' said the same executive. One problem is seen as the detachment
of Sir David Scholey, chairman, from day-to-day management.
Whether or not it can pacify its employees, the bank may have difficultly
persuading its shareholders and analysts to accept a resumption of the old
strategy. This appears to be what they will attempt, with executives arguing
that only Morgan Stanley was an appropriate merger opportunity.
The most obvious alternative would be a merger with another 'bulge bracket'
firm from New York such as Goldman Sachs or Merrill Lynch. Yet Warburg
executives believe that Goldman's more hard-driving and aggressive culture
would not match its own, and neither's businesses would fit its own.
But bids from other banks remain possible, especially given the attention
Warburg has drawn to its own valuation. Some potential acquirers yesterday
played down the chance of an immediate bid, although they said it might
become more attractive if Warburg was further weakened.
One rival said delay might be the best strategy. 'If I wait a week or two it
might get worse,' he said. He also argued that it would become easier to
take business from Warburg on the argument that 'a bank that handles its own
business so badly should not be advising anyone else'.
A further difficulty for Warburg is that the circumstances under which the
merger collapsed draws attention to divisions between it and MAM.
The fund management firm drew attention to its independence this year when
it penalised Warburg over its parent's handling of Enterprise Oil's bid for
Lasmo. The obstacles thrown by MAM in the way of the merger can hardly
improve relations between the two companies, although Warburg executives
insist that MAM's independence is vital to its success, and the value of its
75 per cent stake. Yet the embarrassment could provoke it to try to take MAM
back into full ownership. For Morgan Stanley, questions over the future
appear less pressing.
The firm's executives implied that buying MAM at a discount to the price
seen in US acquisitions was the main attraction of the merger. Morgan
Stanley has already built a larger European operation than Warburg's US arm.
Even so, the merger's collapse brings back questions for Morgan Stanley.
With strong capital and ambitions, it has built up a reasonable presence in
Europe, but it still has a long way to go, and it will now have to grow
organically. Its failure to gain control of MAM may also prompt it to search
for another fund management acquisition.
Probably the most bewildered participants in the entire week-long drama will
be the other investment banks and brokers of the City of London. After
Warburg's announcement last week, many reflected on how long they could last
under independent ownership, and without integrating.
The Warburg-Morgan Stanley incident has demonstrated once again that mergers
in the volatile and often temperamental world of investment banking are
easier dreamed up than achieved. If the fundamentals of the market have not
changed, rivals may at least resolve to take their time.
In the wider world of global investment banking, rivals may be relieved that
a strong global force is not created at a single stroke. Yet the fact that
two firms were prepared even to consider such a bold move shows how high the
stakes are becoming in the battle to build truly global firms.

The mood at Warburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse of talks came just as Warburg employees were beginning to come
to terms with the merger and even, some of them, relish the broader horizons
it would open up.
'Personally I am disappointed. What was being offered here was a brave new
world,' said one employee. He said that the chance of a more dynamic future
outweighed the threat of job cuts, at least for younger staff. But staff say
the company is 'split down the middle'. One spoke of the existence of an old
guard who 'do not have much to gain from this and have much to lose. They
will be able to prolong the status quo,' he said.
Some New York staff and Eurobond traders, the Warburg employees most exposed
to rationalisation, have been given a stay of execution and will also be
relieved.
There is a general recognition nevertheless that the collapse of merger
talks is not the end of the story. Either another buyer, or Warburg itself,
will force job cuts.
When or how has become even more uncertain than it was a week ago,
contributing to the sense of insecurity at Warburg.
'We now have to go through a period where we worry about whether there will
be another bid. We are in limbo,' said one bond specialist.
Bewilderment has sometimes turned to anger. 'We have been led up the garden
path and then shoved back out again,' said one employee.
Faith in management has been seriously shaken. Cynics at Warburg are
betting, not on markets, but on the future of Lord Cairns, the chief
executive, after what one described as 'the bizarre course' of the abortive
merger talks.

FT  16 DEC 94 / SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley: Back to the drawing board -
What now for Morgan Stanley?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An opportunistic move to pick up a leading UK fund management company on the
cheap? Or part of a broader strategic move to outflank other US investment
banks on the international stage?
Whatever the real motivation behind Morgan Stanley's interest in SG Warburg,
the collapse of the proposed deal raises questions about its international
aspirations.
Morgan Stanley remains a relative minnow in asset management, though bigger
than Wall Street rivals such as Goldman Sachs or Salomon.
The bank has set a high priority on building this business further: in the
increasingly capital-intensive and volatile investment banking business it
remains a relatively stable source of fee income, says Mr Richard Fisher,
chairman.
Morgan Stanley executives yesterday ruled out buying another UK merchant
bank - but, notably, did not rule out buying another asset management firm
outside the US.
Meanwhile, in the broader business of investment banking - raising capital
for companies and others, distributing and trading securities and advising
on mergers and acquisitions - Morgan already has highly developed
international operations. Two out of five employees are based overseas, with
700 in Tokyo, 400 in Hong Kong and nearly 2,000 in London.
Gaps remain: in equities research in Asia, for instance, or in its
relationships with UK companies and equities distribution in Europe. Morgan
executives say these weaknesses can be met by growing its existing business,
rather than buying a competitor.
Revenues from outside the US, largely from trading and corporate advisory
work, are already stronger than most other US investment banks.
In 1993, thanks to a good year in Europe's bond markets, Morgan Stanley made
pre-tax income of Dollars 720m (Pounds 439m) in the region - 60 per cent of
its worldwide income, and far more than the Pounds 179m reported by Warburg.
'The profitability of our operations outside the US, as measured either by
return on capital, or profit per professional, has been at least as big as
in the US,' says Mr Phil Duff, Morgan's chief financial officer.
The US and European bond markets have been volatile this year. But Mr Fisher
says: 'We have made the decision to fund the growth through this difficult
period.' Staff growth outside the US bears this out this year: numbers have
grown by 15 per cent, at a time when US investment banks generally have been
shrinking.
If, however, financial markets remain weak for long, then those investments
seem certain to be scaled back.

FT  16 DEC 94 / SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley: Subtle shift in the
relationship - Warburg and MAM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When SG Warburg sold off a quarter of its holding in Mercury Asset
Management in 1986, it was trying to make a point.
Not only did it want to reap some of the value of its fast-growing fund
management arm, it wished to underscore the independence of MAM. At a time
when too many questions were being asked about dealings between the fund
management and stock brokerage arms of merchant banks, independence seemed
like a good message to send to the public.
Warburg has underlined the message by siting its headquarters in Finsbury
Avenue in the City of London and those of MAM just on the edge near London
Bridge.
Now, officials at Warburg may well be wondering whether MAM has become a
little too independent. With a potentially valuable merger between Warburg
and US investment bank Morgan Stanley thwarted by the independence of MAM
directors, the relationship between the two firms may be permanently
altered.
'MAM have always seen themselves as very independent of Warburg. Not only
for regulatory reasons but because their business in character is very
different from that of Warburg,' said a fund manager at a rival firm. 'At
the level of the MAM board, they will not welcome losing their
independence.'
Neither Warburg nor MAM would comment on suggestions that the Morgan Stanley
deal has badly strained relations between the two. 'There are relationships
here which go back 20 years,' one MAM insider said.
But the head of a rival fund management firm argues that 'there must be some
bad blood between those two buildings'.
'There are bound to be a few recriminations,' adds Mr Philip Gibbs,
securities industry analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
And, industry experts say, MAM may well emerge with the upper hand. Over the
past seven years, MAM has consistently accounted for the lion's share of
Warburg's earnings, Mr Gibbs notes. Any effort by Warburg to force MAM
directors to toe the line could encourage the departure of some of its
leading lights - thus undermining MAM's value. Within Warburg, MAM has its
own board and executive committee, and considerable autonomy in setting its
own strategy and expansion. Its executive committee reports to the Warburg
board, of which its chairman, Mr Hugh Stevenson, is a member.
MAM has periodically asserted its independence in ways that have proven
embarrassing to Warburg. For instance, MAM directors were so irritated at
the way Warburg handled the purchase of shares in oil company Lasmo, for
which the bank's client, Enterprise, was making a hostile bid, that it cut
its dealing with Warburg's brokerage arm for several weeks.
MAM and Warburg are now both expected to mull the contentious issue of
whether the minority stake in the fund management company ought to be
purchased by Warburg. One objective would be to ensure that MAM cannot
thwart a marriage should another suitor emerge.
Alternatively, some analysts suggest that Warburg may wish to sell its MAM
holding and re-invest the capital in its investment banking business.

The company is to restructure its regulated business as a result of the
industry's price review, writes Roland Adburgham. The move is likely to
result in redundancies of about 10 per cent among its workforce of 600. The
industry regulator has set the company's K factor, which determines by how
much prices can rise above inflation, at 1 per cent for each of the next
five years. 'To ensure at least the matching of the efficiency criteria
underlying the determination, it will be necessary to take a number of
actions including a major internal restructuring programme,' said Sir John
Wills, chairman. The company reported a 15 per cent rise in pre-tax profits
to Pounds 4.73m (Pounds 4.12m) for the six months to September 30, helped by
a Pounds 700,000 profit from the sale of non-operational properties. The
interim dividend is 12p (11.1p); earnings per share were 49.2p (44.5p) basic
and 45.3p (39.9p) fully diluted. Turnover rose 4 per cent to Pounds 31.3m.
Operating profits were Pounds 6.55m (Pounds 6.4m), after a Pounds 1.1m

Asda yesterday claimed success for its strategy of returning to its roots as
a low-priced superstore, as it outstripped profit forecasts and reported
underlying sales increases well ahead of its rivals.
However, Mr Archie Norman, chief executive, warned that the 'watershed era'
of intense competition and falling margins in grocery retailing was likely
to continue for another two years.
The UK's fourth largest grocery retailer announced a 47 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits for the 28 weeks to November 12 from Pounds 74m to Pounds
108.7m - against City forecasts of Pounds 97m-Pounds 106m.
Profits last year were depressed by Pounds 14.4m losses at Allied Maples,
the furniture and carpet subsidiary sold to Carpetland last December,
flattering the latest results. Core Asda chain's operating profits, however,
increased 17 per cent from Pounds 95.1m to Pounds 111.5m.
Asda also announced plans to open its first 24-hour superstore increasing
the stakes in the battle for Christmas trade. The store in Clapham, London,
will be open all hours on December 22 and 23.
Mr Norman, who was the first industry figure to warn that the 'halcyon days'
of food retailing were over, disputed claims by rivals J. Sainsbury, Tesco
and Argyll that the fall in industry gross margins in the past year was a
one-off 'step change'.
'I don't know how they can say that with a straight face,' he said. 'This
(step change) was supposed to have happened a year ago, but gross margins
have continued to decline in the last four months.'
He said pressure on margins would persist as long as growth in industry
selling space outstripped demand growth.
Tougher government planning restrictions, were likely to reduce the number
of new superstores opened in 1996-97, so the level of excess capacity would
fall.
'The tightening of planning is the best thing that has happened to the
industry,' Mr Norman said.
Yesterday's figures demonstrated a further strong recovery in the fortunes
of Asda, whose future looked in doubt in 1991 when it had debts of Pounds
1bn. The group has paid off borrowings which stood at Pounds 82.7m last
April, and has net cash of Pounds 19.8m.
Asda is nearing the end of a three-year recovery programme designed to
transform it from a clone of Sainsbury or Safeway into a store catering for
'ordinary working people and their families, who demand value'.
But Mr Norman countered analysts' fears that growth would now slow, saying
there was still scope for raising the performance of Asda's stores.
The store refurbishment programme would continue and new information
technology would be introduced. Asda planned to increase the turnover of its
clothing range and develop its leisure range.
Total sales increased 8.4 per cent to Pounds 2.66bn. Like-for-like sales,
which exclude new stores, increased 7.1 per cent - well ahead of Asda's
bigger rivals.
Asda attributed the sales increase to improved customer service product
quality, and lower prices - resulting in a fall in gross margins of half a
percentage point. The operating margin increased from 3.9 per cent to 4.2
per cent.
The interim dividend increased from 0.55p to 0.61p, with earnings per share
up from 1.79p to 2.62p.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Government plays for time on rec bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government said yesterday it would retain its 'golden' shares in the
regional electricity companies until March 31 1995, making impossible the
completion of a potential takeover by Trafalgar House, the conglomerate, of
Northern Electric before then.
The statement was viewed in the City as a stalling tactic while ministers
considered the political implications of a bid. It strengthened the view of
some analysts that a bid might be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission. 'The government may be unwilling to make the final decision on
such a politically sensitive takeover itself,' said one.
Trafalgar House said yesterday that any offer would not be financed by
another rights issue. It is thought that Northern shareholders would be
offered high-yielding convertible shares with a cash alternative
underwritten by Hongkong Land, Trafalgar's 25 per cent shareholder.
Trafalgar shares added 1 1/2 p to 73 1/2 p yesterday after it announced
better-than-expected full-year figures. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 45.6m
compared with a loss of Pounds 347m in 1992-93.
Northern Electric is thought to have turned down a request to meet Trafalgar
board members because the potential predator has made no formal proposals.
Trafalgar announced on Wednesday it was considering a bid. Northern
yesterday requested an inquiry into the recent sharp rises in its shares.
The Stock Exchange said it was already 'carrying out inquiries into the
circumstances surrounding trading in the shares'.
Shares in Northern fell 26p yesterday to 980p yesterday, but most of the
other 11 regional electricity companies (recs) rose further. The highest
rises were at Midlands Electricity, up 32p to 834p, and East Midland
Electricity, 29p higher at 795p.
The political sensitivity of the possible bid was underlined when Mr Martin
O'Neill, Labour energy spokesman, said Trafalgar was attracted to Northern
because of a slack regulatory regime enjoyed by recs. He called for any bid
to be referred. 'The MMC should be laying down ground rules for the future
ownership of the recs once the government's special share has expired.'
Trafalgar House is still thought likely to go ahead with a bid. Although it
has not ruled out launching an offer this year, the likelihood is that it
will wait until January.
Mr John Deane, finance director of Southern Electric, who suggested earlier
this week that his company would consider mergers with other recs, yesterday
ruled out bidding for Northern. 'We would not want to get into a competitive
bid,' he said.
Speaking about Trafalgar's results, Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said: 'Much
progress has been made and the company is well on the way to achieving a
framework of strong central financial discipline combined with delegated
operational authority.' He said that Trafalgar was committed to developing
'a portfolio of investments in infrastructure projects'.
It is thought Trafalgar will argue that a takeover of Northern would provide
it with the cashflow and additional skills to take advantage of the growth
of design, build and operate schemes in Asia.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Swiss Re and CS Holding strengthen business links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Swiss Reinsurance, the world's second largest reinsurance group, is to take
a 20 per cent stake in the derivatives arm of CS Holding, the financial
services group built around Credit Suisse.
Swiss Re will buy the holding in Credit Suisse Financial Products, the CS
subsidiary that is a world leader in financial derivative products, in a
cash and shares deal.
The companies did not disclose details of the CSFP transaction, but as part
of the consideration, CS Holding will raise its stake in Swiss Re from 5 per
cent to 9 per cent.
At yesterday's SFr794 closing price of a Swiss Re registered share, a 4 per
cent stake was worth SFr1.3bn (Pounds 630m).
Credit Suisse and CS First Boston, which each own 50 per cent of CSFP, will
see their capital stakes reduced to 40 per cent each.
Credit Suisse, however, will retain a 56 per cent voting stake, thereby
ensuring that its balance sheet backs up CSFP activities.
CSFP has capital and retained earnings of slightly less than Dollars 1bn.
Last year, its net income totalled SFr444m, and CS has said it has continued
to perform very strongly this year.
Swiss Re and CS also announced a strategic alliance in financial and
reinsurance products.
The two are launching a Dollars 200m (Pounds 122m) insurance investment fund
aimed at fledgling reinsurance companies, mainly in Asia and eastern Europe,
and two other joint ventures.
A second joint venture will be formed between Swiss Re and Credit Suisse, to
develop products for their common clients.
A third, between Swiss Re and CSFP, would develop and market derivatives on
reinsurance products.
This is the second major strategic move at Swiss Re in the past few months.
In September, it sold off its direct insurance interests for some SFr5.3bn.
Mr Lukas Muhlemann, a management consultant who joined the group as chief
executive in August, said the group had decided to concentrate on its core
reinsurance business.
Swiss Re said it felt that the application of financial derivatives to risk
management in reinsurance was a strategic area of the future.
'We feel we have to be in it,' the company said.
CS said it was finding that reinsurance was becoming an element in more and
more of its business deals and saw the alliance with Swiss Re as an
opportunity to develop new products.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Swissair in Belgian talks to gain stake in Sabena
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A radical change in the ownership of Sabena, the Belgian national carrier,
was on the cards last night as Swissair, Switzerland's national airline,
confirmed it was in discussions with the Belgian government.
In a move that would provide Swissair with a secure foothold in the European
Union's single aviation market, the airline's board of directors said it had
asked the executive management to take steps towards closer ties with
Sabena.
The board also stipulated the terms and conditions on which such a
relationship would depend, but would not confirm reports that it was aiming
for a 49 per cent stake in the Belgian carrier. 'These matters are currently
the subject of promising discussions between the two companies,' Swissair
said yesterday.
It now looks likely that Air France's 25 per cent interest in the Belgian
airline will be bought, either by the Belgian government or Swissair,
clearing the way for a deal to go ahead. Air France owns two-thirds of
Finacta, a Belgian holding company which has a 37.5 per cent stake in
Sabena. The Belgian state owns 51 per cent of Sabena.
Although the French carrier is thought to be reluctant to end its links with
Sabena, it has come under heavy pressure from the Belgian government to do
so, and is understood to be ready to discuss terms under which it would sell
its stake.
Mr Elio di Rupo, the Belgian communications minister, said negotiations
would start 'very soon'. The Sabena board meets today, and an announcement
could follow as early as next week.
In a letter to personnel, Mr Pierre Godfroid, the Sabena chairman said:
'Swissair wishes to acquire a significant shareholding in Sabena's capital
with a view to strengthening our shareholders' equity.'
Switzerland's main airline is desperate to find a base inside the EU so it
can take advantage of the deregulated single aviation market. It is also
worried that Switzerland's continued determination to remain outside the
Union has resulted in unfavourable treatment at key European hubs.
'Swissair feels a bit out in the cold,' said Mr Quentin Quarterman, an
analyst at Smith New Court. 'It finds it difficult to get new European
destination slots, especially in Italy.'
Pressure to find an entry into the EU increased after the collapse last year
of the so-called Alcazar plan to merge Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,
Scandinavian Airlines System and Austrian Airlines.
Sabena, which last year made losses of BFr4.5bn (Pounds 89m), has meanwhile
been seeking to pressure Air France into reducing or selling its minority
stake in the state-owned national carrier to enable the formation of a
partnership with another airline.
Sabena has long been seeking to forge new partnerships in an attempt to
strengthen its international operations. Both Swissair and Sabena have
code-sharing agreements with Delta Airlines of the US under which they link
their route networks on booking systems.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Clinton aims Dollars 60bn tax cuts at middle classes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton last night jumped on the fast rolling tax-cutting
bandwagon by proposing a five-year, Dollars 60bn (Pounds 38.4bn) programme
of relief principally aimed at middle-income Americans with children, to
take effect from January 1 1996.
The plan, which he called 'a middle-class bill of rights', was his first
considered public response to the Republican landslide in the November 8
mid-term elections and to the welter of opposition policy initiatives that
have been announced since then.
The cost of the tax cuts, he said in a nationally televised address, would
be more than covered by cutting Dollars 24bn from the budgets of the
housing, energy and transportation departments, including the privatisation
of operations such as the naval petroleum reserve and air traffic control,
and by Dollars 52bn in savings by extending for two more years until 1998
the existing freeze on discretionary federal spending.
In a detailed address, the conclusion of which was strikingly personal in
tone, Mr Clinton warned the new Republican majority in Congress: 'I won't
support ideas that sound good but aren't paid for.'
He also took issue with some of the more ideological proposals of the
opposition designed at eviscerating the welfare state. 'I want a leaner, not
a meaner, government,' he said. He called for 'less malice and more charity'
in public discourse.
Only hours before he spoke, Senator Phil Gramm, from Texas, said his party
would accept nothing less than the Dollars 107bn tax cut promised in the
Republican election manifesto, and again demanded the abolition of federal
departments such as housing. Whatever the president proposed, Mr Gramm said,
was a 'non-starter'.
Beyond the plan's details, the president was also under pressure to prove
that he had not been marginalised by Republican control of both houses of
Congress. Mr Clinton and his administration have appeared defensive to the
point of disorientation for much of the past five weeks.
A central ingredient of the Clinton plan, recalling some of his 1992
election campaign promises to cut taxes on the middle class, is to allow
families with annual incomes of up to Dollars 120,000 a year to write off up
to Dollars 10,000 in college tuition costs. He also proposed a tax credit of
up to Dollars 500 a child under the age of 13 for families earning less than
Dollars 75,000 a year.
He announced a new proposal to encourage personal savings by allowing those
on income under Dollars 100,000 a year to deduct up to Dollars 2,000 for
investments in personal pension plans.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Counties reprieved in Banham reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most English counties will survive under reforms announced yesterday by Sir
John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission, reversing plans to
abolish them.
Sir John described the reorganisation of local government as a 'gamble', and
said there was no evidence that authorities created by the restructuring
would improve services.
The changes he announced would cost up to Pounds 90m to implement and
additional administrative costs of up to Pounds 35m.
Only Berkshire and Dorset, of the 18 counties for which he announced
proposals yesterday, will be abolished. That brings the total of counties to
be replaced with unitary councils - which combine the powers of district and
county councils - to eight.
Sir John has already announced that a further 26 county councils will
continue in their present two-tier form, and is expected to confirm next
month that the remaining five will also maintain the two-tier system.
In September last year, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, said he
wanted two tiers to continue only in 'exceptional' circumstances.
However, Rutland and Herefordshire have regained their independence as
unitary authorities, having lost it in the last review in 1974. In total,
yesterday's proposals call for 20 unitary authorities to be created, with a
combined annual revenue expenditure of about Pounds 10bn and a total
workforce of about 250,000.
Sir John predicted that Rutland residents would face extra annual
administrative costs of Pounds 100 a head, but he described public support
as 'overwhelming'. Mr Alan Duncan, Rutland's Conservative MP, said local
people were 'jubilant'.
Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow environment secretary, claimed the review was
'becoming more and more chaotic and inconsistent'.

FT  16 DEC 94 / British Gas drops high street advice and payment services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas is to withdraw all consumer advice and complaints services from
its high street showrooms next month as part of the transformation of its
network into a purely retail operation.
The company has agreed to trade union requests to station security guards at
some shops because of fears that the withdrawal of services might anger some
customers.
A trial of the new-style showrooms in nine cities has resulted in threats by
some customers to employees, according to British Gas officials.
At present, consumers can use gas showrooms to pay bills, inquire about
services, make complaints or receive energy efficiency advice.
But from January 3 the shops will be converted to wholly retail appliance
outlets. The advice and complaint services will be available by telephone
for the price of a local call.
Customers who want to pay their bills in person will be directed to post
offices or encouraged to pay by bank transfer.
Ofgas, the industry regulator, said it was satisfied with the alternative
arrangements. It regards the post office scheme, introduced this year, as
particularly effective, as gas bills can be paid at any of 19,000 post
offices, compared with only 266 gas showrooms.
Meanwhile, the series of public-relations pitfalls that has beset British
Gas in recent weeks continued when MPs and consumer groups criticised the
company for trying to impose deep pay cuts on showroom workers only weeks
after Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive, was awarded a 75 per
cent pay rise.
The House of Commons employment committee said it wants Mr Brown to testify
at a hearing into the issue of executive pay next month.
Yesterday's furore concerned the retail division, which this year was made a
separate business unit as part of British Gas's restructuring. The number of
showroom workers is to fall from 3,300 to 1,300 by 1996.
The division's managers say they have inherited pay scales and working terms
and conditions that are inappropriate to the retail sector.
Mr Bill Adamson, sales director, said showroom staff were paid about 15 per
cent more than their counterparts in similar shops, and terms and working
conditions were more generous.
Pay talks were continuing, he said, and no action would be taken until the
middle of next year.

FT  16 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Siemens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is encouraging that Siemens is predicting a 20 per cent increase in net
profits in the current year, but this does not mean a revolution in the
group's poor competitive position. The expected turnaround at the ailing
Siemens Nixdorf information technology subsidiary is one factor: recovery
here is welcome, but long overdue and Siemens should have bitten the bullet
and pulled out of this business years ago. Another factor is likely to be
reduced spending on rationalisation, which absorbed DM2.7bn (Pounds 1.1bn)
in the last financial year. This was far more than its net profits of
DM1.65bn, and yet the headcount has dropped by a modest 21,000 out of a
total workforce of 382,000 people.
This year Siemens is likely to cut 12,000 jobs, but it should be doing more
to cut costs. The message is underscored by the publication yesterday of the
first segmental breakdown of operating profits. The table showed that
telecommunications accounted for more than half the group's non-financial
profits. That is more than expected and reveals heavy dependence on a market
vulnerable to price pressures in the run-up to Deutsche Telekom's
privatisation. Analysts meeting the company in Munich today should press
hard on how it intends to deal with the challenge, if not through further
cost-cutting.

FT  16 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Asda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Asda's shares have outperformed the market by 34 per cent so far this year,
the best performance of any FTSE 100 stock after British Steel and GKN, and
better than all the food retailers except Morrison. Yesterday's sparkling
figures show why.
Asda is enjoying a renaissance which has brought it back from the brink.
Like-for-like sales growth rose 7.1 per cent in the first half, far better
than other superstores and a considerable achievement in a competitive
market. The performance reflects a full-scale revamp of the stores'
offering, as well as price cutting. The latter led to a 0.5 per cent fall in
gross margins, significantly worse than at competitors such as J. Sainsbury
or Tesco. However this was more than offset by a combination of greater
productivity and increased sales volumes. The result is that operating
profits at the Asda stores rose at more than twice the rate of sales growth.
The muted market reaction to yesterday's numbers reflects some disquiet
about Asda's falling depreciation charge. But the real issue is whether Asda
is becoming just another well-run food retailer, rather than a recovery
story. Its three year restructuring programme comes to an ends next summer.
Thereafter earnings growth will slow. In the meantime, investors'
preferences are likely to shift to the dull performers in the sector, for
example J. Sainsbury.

FT  16 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar House
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar House got off to a good start in the inevitable battle with
Northern Electric over which boasts the better management. Admittedly, it
was never going to be difficult to improve on Trafalgar's Pounds 427m losses
achieved in the previous two years. Performance for 1994 also benefited from
last year's Pounds 195m of property write-downs. That boosted profits from
housing and property sales, and also enabled Pounds 20m of write-backs.
Nevertheless, the new management from Hongkong Land deserves credit for
improving efficiency within the core businesses. The engineering division
was always a world leader with stable revenues throughout the recession, but
management controls had vanished. Under the new regime, engineering costs
fell by Pounds 30m last year, following 2,000 redundancies. Performance may
have been hit by a Pounds 22m restructuring charge and tight margins as
Trafalgar works through an order book built during the recession. But the
engineering division is now highly geared towards recovery.
This year, group profits will rise rapidly as exceptional losses fall. But
there is a danger that this could be eclipsed by its interest in Northern.
Steady but boring utility earnings would dilute the impact of an
engineering-led recovery. Moreover, even if a bid for Northern does not
proceed, Hongkong Land has signalled it wants to put more money into an
enlarged Trafalgar. That may reduce the opportunity for earnings growth.
Investors should be wary.

FT  16 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Warburg wounded
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The failure of SG Warburg's merger talks with Morgan Stanley leaves the
former wounded. Warburg has signalled its need for a partner with strong US
securities distribution to achieve its ambition of becoming a global
investment bank. It may put on a brave face and say it can still pursue this
goal using its own resources. But it will be hard to convince shareholders,
customers and employees that it is possible or sensible to do so -
particularly with Morgan Stanley indicating that it considered Mercury Asset
Management rather than Warburg the crown jewel in any merger.
The snag is that Warburg has come so far down this road that it will be hard
to turn back. The concept of a global investment bank may be valid, given
the internationalisation of capital markets. But Warburg has invested much
money pursuing this goal without generating appropriate dividends. It has
accumulated a cost base attuned to its global ambitions but not the revenues
to match.
One alternative would be to abandon its global ambitions and retrench as a
niche operator. But this would require big restructuring charges, as well as
the management eating a large humble pie. Another alternative would be for
Warburg to sell itself to a larger commercial or investment bank. There
would be no shortage of suitors. The opportunity to buy a merchant bank with
Warburg's franchise rarely occurs. But a cash sale would not appeal to the
management and a hostile bid is unlikely.
Morgan Stanley comes out of the saga looking greedy. It hoped to acquire MAM
without paying its minority shareholders an appropriate premium. Warburg
looks naive in allowing Morgan Stanley to hold the belief that it could get
away with this.
Warburg's board is now under pressure to prove itself. It must restore
morale among its workforce while controlling its costs. It will also need to
demonstrate to shareholders that pouring more money into the global strategy
is a wise use of their funds.

FT  15 DEC 94 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: No action to be taken over
leaked BTR announcement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 17th December 1994) appended to this article.
The Stock Exchange is to take no formal action after the Pounds 35.5m
disposal by BTR of three subsidiaries was announced in Australia before
London markets had been informed.
Presspart Manufacturing and Decorpart of Lancashire and Presspart of North
Carolina are being sold to management, which will combine the businesses
into a 500-employee group exporting nearly 60 per cent of its UK output.
Combined turnover is about Pounds 30m with profits of about Pounds 5m.
The sale was supposed to be announced in London at 7.30am yesterday, but the
news was out in Australia at least 12 hours earlier.
The Manchester office of 3i, which brokered the merger and negotiated the
sale, is putting Pounds 13m of equity into the venture. The Royal Bank of
Scotland is providing senior debt of Pounds 20m, with Pounds 6m of mezzanine
debt coming from Intermediate Capital Group.
Under exchange rules, quoted companies should ensure all investors get the
same information at the same time when a potentially price-sensitive
transaction occurs.
In this case, although there is understood to be some annoyance, the breach
is seen as unintentional, with little opportunity for trading between the
announcements.
BTR acquired Presspart and Decorpart when it bought the Rockware Group in
1991. Presspart has struggled under a succession of managers, but Decorpart
has prospered since Rockware headhunted Mr Ray Maddison, a steel industry
specialist, in 1990 to run it.
The companies make cans for the beer, beverages, drugs and cosmetics markets
and are understood to have recently worked out how to use metal to make the
in-can 'widgets' which gassify beers, solving recycling problems caused by
first-generation plastic devices.
3i has insisted on Mr Ray Way, chairman of Denby, becoming Presspart's
non-executive chairman. It is also bringing in a finance director.
CORRECTION
In an article in Thursday's issue, we referred to a leaked announcement and
a breach of Stock Exchange regulations on the part of BTR in relation to the
disposal of three subsidiaries. It has since been made clear to us that
there was no breach of Stock Exchange regulations, nor was the announcement
in any way prematurely or incorrectly disclosed. Accordingly there was no
issue for the Stock Exchange to consider. We regret the error.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Observer: On the Wild side
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So 'Wild' Bill Buford, editor of the London-based quarterly publication
Granta, is defecting to the New Yorker magazine as its literary and fiction
editor. Judging by the sounds of lamentation and rending of garments
emanating from British literary circles yesterday, anyone would have thought
the chancellor had slapped top-rate VAT on books.
It was 15 years ago that the flamboyant American took on Granta, then an
ailing Cambridge undergraduate periodical, and turned it into a vital forum
for the best in new writing, from fiction to reportage and travel writing,
with a circulation of 95,000.
Described by one former colleague as 'an exasperating genius', Buford is
very much the hands-on editor - wielding, his contributors would say, a
machete rather than a more delicate instrument. His own book, Among the
Thugs, by the way, is a study of British football hooligans - not a
confession of his professional modus vivendi.
In latter years, though, Granta had lost some of its ability to surprise and
many of its regular contributors - Salman Rushdie, Martin Amis, Hanif
Kureishi and Julian Barnes - are now established columnists on the more
lucrative New Yorker. 'He's following the market really,' is how Kureishi
puts it.
While Granta without Buford is hard enough to imagine, Buford with a boss is
a yet more challenging concept. But no doubt Tina Brown, the New Yorker's
fierce British editor, will know when to put the boot in.

stake

<TEXT>
Hungary's privatisation authorities yesterday backed down and agreed to sell
a 51 per cent stake in the country's last state-owned hotel chain to
American General Hospitality, a privately-held US hotel management group.
AGH won the right to negotiate for HungarHotels last month but talks broke
down between the company and the privatisation body after a last-minute
price increase and political pressure to hand over the group to the
cash-strapped social security fund.
The deal, which is due to be signed by mid-January, is only the second large
privatisation to have come up since the new socialist-led government took
office in July and has been viewed as a indication of the new
administration's commitment to privatisation.
The State Property Agency agreed to sell 51 per cent of the chain minus one
hotel for Dollars 57.5m, AGH's original bid for the whole 15-hotel group.
The remaining hotel, which has a book value of Dollars 9m, is to be sold off
with the proceeds going to the SPA, Mr Ferenc Bartha, government
privatisation commissioner said. He said AGH had agreed to invest Dollars
19.5m in the chain over the next three years and not to sell off any of the
hotels during that time. The SPA's remaining 31 per cent stake would be
floated on the Budapest stock exchange.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has agreed to
support the Polish government's sale of the Krakow-based Bank Przemyslowo
Handlowy (BPH) with a standby share purchase agreement.
The EBRD has said it would purchase up to 30 per cent of the offer should
the government fail to place the shares. The public offer, which opened last
Monday and runs until January 12, puts 50.2 per cent of the bank's equity on
the market. It is Poland's largest privatisation this year, and is worth at
least 4,130bn zlotys (Dollars 170m).
The sale of BPH, one of Poland's largest banks and the fourth state-owned
bank to be privatised, compares with the 13,800bn zlotys in new share offers
and rights issues taken up by the domestic market in the first
three-quarters of the year.
Mr Krzysztof Kalicki, the deputy finance minister responsible for the sale,
was in London yesterday speaking to foreign investors, who are crucial to
the success of the sale. Morale is low among local small investors, who have
yet to absorb this year's losses following large falls on the stock market
since the spring.
The EBRD has said it would buy the shares at the minimum price of 700,000
zlotys, which gives the bank a price-earnings ratio of 3.8.
The sale of BPH, which had net profits of 1,649bn zlotys for the first nine
months of this year, was set by western governments as a condition of
granting Poland Dollars 600m.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Amtrak axes 5,500 jobs in bid to cut projected Dollars 200m
deficit: Troubled US train operator slashes services as ticket sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amtrak, the US public sector train operator, is cutting about 5,500 jobs and
shutting down 21 per cent of its passenger service in an effort to eliminate
a projected Dollars 200m deficit this fiscal year.
Amtrak said most of the cuts would be in the frequency of train services,
but some routes would be eliminated, including services between Chicago and
Milwaukee, Chicago and Grand Rapids and San Jose to Sacramento and
Roseville, California.
Mr Thomas Downs, Amtrak president, said the system could no longer afford to
maintain its service to 540 cities across the US as a result of a rising
deficit and shrinking ticket sales.
Amtrak admitted earlier this year that it was losing Dollars 33 on every
ticket sold.
Its efficiency record has deteriorated and last year saw the worst accident
in the network's history when 47 people died in a crash on the Los Angeles
to Miami route.
Amtrak lost Dollars 76.2m in fiscal 1994, the fifth straight year it has
been in the red. Passenger numbers fell about 300,000 from the year before.
The rail system has always depended heavily on federal subsidies, this year
worth Dollars 952m.
The cuts announced yesterday are expected to save Dollars 173m in the
current fiscal year, and more than Dollars 360m in 1996 and annually
thereafter.
In addition to the three routes being scrapped, other services will be cut
back, including trains from St Louis to Kansas City, Birmingham to Mobile,
Alabama, and New York to Montreal.
Amtrak, which operates its services on track owned by the private sector,
said it was planning further cuts in the frequency of services, which it
will announce later.
Mr Downs said: 'In the past we have tried to be every place all the time.'
But 'rail passenger services can't afford that anymore . . . in a rapidly
changing transportation environment'.
Decisions on what services to cut and reduce were made 'strictly on what
made economic sense', he said.

FT  15 DEC 94 / World Trade News: US probe into EU banana trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US trade representative is investigating complaints from US banana
producers that the European Union import regime, which favours banana
suppliers in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of countries, is
discriminatory.
Washington will hold talks with several Caribbean banana exporters in
January over preferential access to the European market. 'The US trade
representative has told us that the investigation will focus on the trade
practices of the EU, and is not directed against the Caribbean exporters,'
said Mr John Compton, the prime minister of St Lucia, the leading exporter
in the Windward Islands. The investigation followed complaints from Chiquita
Brands International, a US company producing bananas in Latin America, and
the Hawaiian Banana Industry Association.
The charge was filed under Section 301 of the US trade act, and was
supported by claims that the EU's import regime, implemented in July 1993,
discriminated against fruit from Latin America. The import regime gives
special access to exporters in the ACP group, about 70 former European
colonies which have a trade treaty with the EU.
In a reversal of policy, the US government said last week that it will not
object to a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade waiver for the Lome
Convention, the trade and aid treaty between the EU and the ACP countries.
This has reduced the threat to the ACP's preferential access to the EU
market.
Officials from other Caribbean exporting countries said that the US trade
representative's statement allowed the region's producers to 'buy some time'
but that the danger to the preferential EU market had not been removed.
The Caribbean Community (Caricom) said the investigation posed a threat to
the Caribbean industry on which many island economies depend.

J. P. Morgan, the US bank, warned that its profits for the last quarter of
the year would not match those of the previous three months, due to weaker
trading revenues, writes Richard Waters in New York.
The news, which reversed a strong rise in the bank's shares earlier in the
day, signalled a weak end to the year generally for banks which are active
in the financial markets.
The consensus among analysts had been for earnings of Dollars 1.69 a share
in the latest period at Morgan, compared with Dollars 1.63 in the previous
quarter. In the final three months of 1993, a period when bond markets
around the world remained strong, the US bank earned Dollars 1.92 a share.
In spite of the warning, the bank lifted its quarterly dividend by 7 cents a
share, to 75 cents.

FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Court ruling likely next week on
BAT bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A judgment is likely next week on the Federal Trade Commission's attempt to
block the Dollars 1bn takeover by BAT Industries of the UK of American
Tobacco, writes Roderick Oram.
The New York city court hearings concluded yesterday after 10 days of
testimony. Judge Milton Pollack will rule before Christmas, lawyers involved
in the case said.
The FTC argued that the takeover would strengthen BAT's third position in
the US market, reducing competition and making it easier for the industry to
raise prices.
BAT argued the purchase would raise its market share from 11 per cent to 18
per cent making it a more effective competitor. Philip Morris leads with 46
per cent and RJR Nabisco is second with 28 per cent.

Nike, the US sports footwear and apparel group, is buying Canstar, Montreal,
the world's biggest ice hockey equipment maker, for CDollars 546m (USDollars
395m) cash, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Canstar's largest shareholders, including chairman Mr Icaro Olivieri, own 46
per cent of the equity and will tender.
Nike's price is CDollars 27.50 per Canstar share compared with Canstar's
share price of CDollars 17 in the market at Tuesday's close. Trading was
halted yesterday.
Nike said Canstar's principal brands, Bauer and Cooper, had global
reputations and would give Nike entry into team sports equipment. Canstar
has a strong position in in-line skating, roller hockey and figure skating
equipment.
Nike said Canstar would operate as an autonomous unit with existing
management.

<TEXT>
Sales of personal computers based on Intel's flawed Pentium microprocessor
chip continued to be robust, in spite of negative publicity and the decision
by IBM to halt sales, US retailers said, writes Louise Kehoe in San
Francisco.
Although customers are asking questions about the chip flaw, they continued
to purchase Pentium PCs in rising numbers, Intel said. 'We have talked to
the leading retailers and they are reporting no slowdown in sales.'
Several leading PC manufacturers said they would continue to sell Pentium
PCs, in spite of IBM's contention that the flaw can cause frequent errors in
mathematical calculations used in spreadsheet and similar applications.
NEC, Japan's dominant personal computer supplier, and Fujitsu, its largest
computer manufacturer, have agreed to replace faulty Intel Pentium
microprocessors free of charge, adds Alan Cane. Some 150,000 Pentium-based
machines have been sold in Japan to date.
Olivetti, the Italian computer maker, said it would replace any faulty
Pentium chips, made by Intel and used in its own personal computers, with an
improved version of the microprocessor.
The computer unit of Germany's Siemens said it would offer help to customers
concerned about flawed Pentium chips from Intel.

FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Chief of Hoechst's French arm
resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Evidence of some of the strains of restructuring at Hoechst, the German
chemicals company, emerged yesterday with the departure of Mr Ernst-Gunter
Afting, president of Roussel-Uclaf, the French company in which Hoechst has
a controlling stake.
Officially, Mr Afting left 'for personal reasons', but he is known to have
had personal and strategy differences for many months with Mr Karl Heinz
Seifert, Hoechst board member with responsibility for both the German
company's pharmaceuticals operations and Roussel-Uclaf.
Mr Afting is replaced at Roussel-Uclaf by Mr Jean Pierre Godard, head of
Hoechst's pharmaceuticals division. Mr Godard, a French national, was an
executive at Roussel-Uclaf before taking his current job at Hoechst's
Frankfurt headquarters.
Mr Afting is considering offers from other pharmaceutical companies, but has
made no decision yet about which to accept.
Hoechst appointed Mr Jurgen Dormann as chairman in May. He quickly embarked
on a restructuring programme which has seen the elimination of thousands of
jobs.
He wants change the group's philosophy from one of a centrally-controlled
bureaucracy to an organisation which delegates power to divisions.

The Dollars 3.1bn restaurant business, which includes chains such as Red
Lobster, The Olive Garden and China Coast, has yet to be named. Mr Bruce

FT  15 DEC 94 / Arts: Brecht updated - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a theatrical work we know is updated and relocated to the place we live
in, we expect a certain gain in immediacy, a certain thrill of recognition,
a certain now-ness. The Donmar Warehouse's new staging of Bertolt Brecht's
and Kurt Weill's 1928 bitter satire The Threepenny Opera (Der
Dreigroschenoper) has been set by its director, Phyllida Lloyd, in London,
and (more or less) in the present day. During the overture, video-screens
show us Mack the Knife (Tom Hollander) fraternising with Trevor Nunn; later
on, they show us Anneka Rice.
Mr Peachum trains beggars in the latest techniques of begging. Jeremy Sams's
ultra-now new lyrics speak of ICI executives who take coke, Tory ministers
who like crumpet, Torvill and Dean, and so on. 'Now remember that fire in
Hounslow? - 20 Asians and the cat?' - sings Jenny in 'The Flick-Knife Song'
about Mack the K. - 'While they're raking through the embers,/ There's a
flick-knife. Fancy that.' The main element of fiction is that Prince William
is about to be crowned William V. Clever stuff.
Too bad, then, that this Threepenny Opera feels remote, artificial,
implausible. One problem is that Lloyd has not managed to give her team of
singing actors any one performing style. Tara Hugo (as Jenny, the whore who
betrays Mack) is mordantly involved; Simon Dormandy (as Tiger Brown, chief
of police) is ironically hammy; Beverley Klein (Mrs Peachum) is vividly
cynical; and so on. Oh yes, and Polly here is Irish, her parents Scottish
and London-Jewish, her two female rivals white American and black English.
Another problem is that The Threepenny Opera is an anti-opera whose balance
of words and music needs to be very finely judged. I guess that this
production has been planned as a sequel to the Donmar Warehouse's very
successful production of Cabaret this time last year. (Cabaret carefully
evoked the German mid-war world that had produced The Threepenny Opera.) The
Warehouse is a marvellous place for music theatre, where songs can be
projected without amplification. Here, Weill's accompaniments have been well
directed by Gary Yershon. (Some songs are miked, but okay - this is to make
a dramatic point.)
But in general this is an evening that forces Brecht noisily down poor
Weill's throat. As Mack, Hollander shouts his songs like a punk rock star.
He is a tight, light frog-like baritone who runs out of voice at either
extreme. His biggest melodic line, the seemingly romantic arch of 'For love
will flourish or fade away', he sings twice. The first time it is a shout,
the second an unimpressive falsetto.
By contrast, Klein delivers Mrs Peachum's music with a buzz-saw vibrato  -
the kind of old-style vocal artifice that surely this kind of music theatre
was never about - even though her voice has a real training that certainly
delivers all her vocal lines firmly in place. It is Hugo whose style of
singing best combines urgent diction and musical phrasing; and hers is by
far the evening's finest performance.
It is hard to believe in little Hollander as 'the last real man in London'.
He plays the role as a coolly vicious spiv, with a blaring Londoner accent
(sounds like Griff Rhys-Jones), and he plays it with unhesitating force. But
he lacks sexual allure and, more important, dimension of spirit. Why should
we spend two hours and three-quarters attending to a tale about this minor
crook? Sharon Small, as Polly, is sometimes too stagey and vocally uneven,
but hers is a talented, if unfocused, performance. As a Scottish Mr Peachum,
Tom Mannion is loud and dull.
Sams's lyrics are so forceful that they contribute to the Brecht-heavy
feeling of the evening. But they are almost all so accomplished and so
right-on that they are one of the few components of this uninvolving
production that I would like to save for another staging of this tricky
work.
At the Donmar Warehouse, WC2

FT  15 DEC 94 / Rebel Chechens face last stand: Capital's inhabitants
confront the military might of Moscow

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Time was running out for the beleaguered rebels of Chechnya yesterday as
Russian forces closed in on the outskirts of their capital.
As General Dzhokar Dudayev, the Chechen president, issued a defiant 'fight
to the death' appeal to his people in a pre-dawn televised address, the
inhabitants of Grozny found themselves caught up in the Russian advance.
Tamisha Mashidova heard the broadcast in the military hospital, where she
works as a ward sister and as an organiser of a movement called the National
Patriotic Society of Mothers and Sisters.
Later, as she went to collect other nurses from Pervomaisk, a Grozny suburb,
in a hospital minibus she saw lines of Russian tanks on a ridge above the
town. Two fighters circled overhead, then dived towards the minibus, firing
rockets, she said. Gilani Chasigov, a reporter from the local TV station,
and a Chechen fighter were hit, the fighter badly. As Ms Mashidova and her
colleagues loaded them into the bus to transfer them to the hospital, the
bombardment began.
On the main road out of Grozny to the west, at one of the many points where
Chechen men gather with nothing more than automatic rifles, a member of the
Confederation of Causasian Peoples said that he heard Gen Dudayev's appeal
as he went to his post.
Withholding his name but giving his rank as lieutenant, he said he was from
Dagestan, the neighbouring republic to Chechnya's east.
'I came in a week ago,' said the volunteer. 'Why? because I believe that the
Caucasian people live in one home. I already fought in Abkhazia against the
Georgians, I will fight here against the Russians. This is our common war.'
If the Russians enter Grozny then they will face a partisan war. 'A war for
the Caucusus,' he added.
Shirwani Bisultanov heard the president's broadcast because he could not
sleep. An advancing Russian column is just 30 km away from his village of
Alkhan Yurt, west of the capital.
He had spent the last few hours torn between his village and the frontline.
With two grenades tucked into his belt, he shouted his challenge to the
Russians: 'I never think of the future, Allah takes care of that. We have
been fighting the Russians for 300 years and here we go again.'

FT  15 DEC 94 / Union Carbide to buy ICI works
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Imperial Chemical Industries is to sell its ethylene oxide plant at Wilton,
Teesside, to Union Carbide, the US chemicals group.
Under the cash deal, due to be announced imminently, ICI will contract to
buy some of the plant's output from Union Carbide. The price paid by Union
Carbide is thought to amount to less than 1 per cent of ICI's assets.
Ethylene Oxide is a raw material for ICI's surfactants operation, one of its
fastest growing businesses, which makes chemicals for use in soaps and
shampoos, and chemicals for pesticides.
Mr Ronnie Hampel, ICI chief executive, said earlier this year that he was
considering selling stakes in the Wilton complex. ICI would never again
build a new ethylene plant, he said.
The company is thought to have been in talks with Union Carbide since the
spring. Union Carbide is believed to be committed to increasing the plant's
capacity as part of the deal. The sale will be the latest in a series of
disposals by ICI of businesses on the Wilton site over the past few years.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Education department told it can save Pounds 1.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department for Education could save Pounds 1.3m a year by better
management of its office space, the National Audit Office said yesterday.
Almost all the savings could be achieved at the department's Sanctuary
Buildings headquarters in London.
Sanctuary Buildings is among the most expensive government buildings. The
department signed a long lease on the building in 1988, when central London
rents were close to their peak.
According to the NAO report, Sanctuary Buildings costs Pounds 594 per sq
metre or Pounds 11,346 per head a year, including rents, rates and service
charges. By using a revised office layout, Sanctuary Buildings could
accommodate another 110 workstations at an annual saving of Pounds 1.3m.
In contrast, the department's main building in Darlington costs only Pounds
87 per sq m or Pounds 1,375 per head per year. The NAO said that the
building could accommodate an additional 75 workstations, giving annual
savings of Pounds 88,000.
The department is unlikely to take all of the NAO recommendations on board.
It said that the increase in the number of staff contained in the
recommended office layouts for Sanctuary Buildings 'would not accord with
efficient and cost-effective working practice'.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Train maker promises big rise in reliability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC-Alsthom, winner of an Pounds 800m contract to supply new trains for
London Underground's Northern Line, has promised to provide an eightfold
increase in the reliability of its trains, it emerged yesterday.
If the conditions are not met, London Underground can reduce payments and,
in the worst case, demand that the Anglo-French engineering group takes back
its trains.
The Treasury hailed the deal, announced last Thursday, as a considerable
success for the private finance initiative, because it transferred
significant risks to the company. GEC-Alsthom will supply just over 100
trains and maintain them for 20 years.
London Underground will pay between Pounds 40m and Pounds 45m a year to
cover the capital cost of the trains and the maintenance charges. At the end
of 20 years it has an option to extend the contract for a further 16 years.
At present London Underground expects its Northern Line trains to break
down, on average, every 2,500 miles, or 2 1/2 weeks. GEC-Alsthom has said
its trains will only fail every 19,000 miles, or four months.
This is a near eightfold improvement on past performance and almost four
times better than the best results achieved on other Underground lines.
Maintaining this level of service would be demanding but it was regarded as
feasible, London Underground said.
If the new trains fall well below the promised reliability, London
Underground can at any time cease making lease payments and arrange for the
return of the trains to the manufacturer. After 12 years it can review the
performance of the trains and, if it is unhappy, return them to GEC-Alsthom.
At the end of the 20-year contract GEC-Alsthom will have received only
two-thirds of the capital value of the trains though they will be fully paid
for after 36 years. This formula means that GEC-Alsthom has an incentive to
provide a good level of service to encourage London Underground to extend
the contract.
GEC-Alsthom will also receive a small payment related to the number of
passengers using the Northern Line although this is not significant in the
overall contract.

British Gas yesterday warned of possible pay cuts for staff in high-street

Corzine writes.
A letter to showroom staff said that pay levels in British Gas shops were
well above those for similar retailers, such as Comet and Rumbelows.
The letter was sent just weeks after the company announced a controversial
75 per cent rise for Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive.
Earlier this year British Gas announced a big closure programme among its
high-street shops, which form one of the least profitable parts of its
operations.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Rebels defy government again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was rocked last night by another rebellion by the group of
backbench Conservative MPs suspended from the parliamentary party after
voting with Labour in a crucial vote on the European Union.
All nine rebel Tories defied the government in a vote on EU fishing policy,
after a debate marked by clashes between Mr Michael Jack, fisheries
minister, and a coalition of Euro-sceptics and backbenchers from fishing
constituencies.
The government beat off a Labour attack on its fisheries policy by 298 votes
to 270, a majority of 28, avoiding defeat on the eve of the Dudley West
by-election, which Labour is expected to win.
However, the vote demonstrated the determination of the Euro-rebels to act
as a group, defying Mr John Major's attempts to discipline them by insisting
that they can only regain the party whip by supporting the government.
One of the rebels, Mr Michael Carttiss, MP for Great Yarmouth, voted with
Labour. The eight who abstained were Mrs Teresa Gorman (Billericay), Mr Tony
Marlow (Northampton N), Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend E), Mr Nick Budgen
(Wolverhampton SW), Mr Christopher Gill (Ludlow), Mr Richard Shepherd
(Aldridge Brownhills), Mr John Wilkinson (Ruislip Northwood), and Sir
Richard Body (Holland With Boston).
The vote resembled last week's government defeat on the imposition of value
added tax on heating fuel, when eight of the nine rebelled. The group
signalled further defiance yesterday by publishing a bill seeking a
referendum on Europe.
The size of the government majority was a minor embarrassment for the Labour
leadership, which had given permission to several MPs to travel to Dudley to
campaign for tomorrow's by-election.
The failure to capitalise on Tory divisions recalled a similar fishing
debate last year, when the government won by a few votes after a poor Labour
turnout. However, Labour whips had indicated that the party was taking a
relaxed approach to the debate because it did not affect legislation.
The crucial vote took place on a Labour amendment criticising a government
motion setting out the government's determination to fight for a good deal
for UK fishermen in EU negotiations next week on Iberian access to fish
stocks.
Tory MPs from fishing constituencies, particularly in the south-west, had
indicated they might join the rebellion, but backed down following appeals
for support from Mr Jack.
However, MPs from both main parties claimed that a secret deal had been
reached at last week's EU summit in Essen that would give the Iberian fleets
virtually free access.
Mr Jack told them: 'I know of no deals that were done in Essen.'

FT  15 DEC 94 / Concern at bank bills for business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
High street banks may have overcharged as many as 10 per cent of small and
medium-sized businesses by up to a total of Pounds 1.75bn, the Banking
Liaison Group says.
The group of former bankers, which advises businesses on relationships with
banks, wants each bank to appoint a senior executive to work with the group
and similar organisations to resolve complaints.
Mr John Sillett, group chief executive, said banks often admitted their
errors but were more unwilling to accept responsibility for consequential
losses or damage to a company's reputation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Guatemalan tax evaders may end up in prison for not paying their taxes after
Congress passed reforms to the penal code which will criminalise tax evasion
for the first time.
The reforms which come into effect on February 1, allow for substantial
fines and prison sentences of up to six years for tax evaders and for
corrupt officials who accept pay-offs.
It also gives the government the right to close businesses temporarily.
The reforms will provide the coercive means to improve tax collection
following the approval at the end of November by congress of a number of tax
reforms intended to increase the tax burden from 7 per cent of GDP this year
to 8.5 per cent in 1995.
Despite pressure from the private sector, the right-wing parties which
dominate Congress approved an increase for the top bracket of income tax
from 25 per cent to 30 per cent, imposed a 1.5 per cent tax on company
assets and agreed to increase sales tax from 7 per cent to 10 per cent by
January 1996.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Lech Walesa (left) is set to veto Poland's new public sector pay
laws which form a mainstay of next year's budget. Mr Leszek Spalinski, the
president's spokesman, said yesterday that it was 99 per cent certain the
law would be vetoed in line with the president's promise to hunger-striking
health workers protesting against the new regulations. The governing
coalition, which controls 298 seats in the 460 member parliament, needs a
two-thirds majority to overrule the veto, which means it will have to secure
a handful of opposition votes if the budget is to be saved. The
Solidarity-led hunger strikers representing 600,000 health service workers
want the government to return to a law passed in 1989 promising public
sector employees an average wage 6 per cent higher than the average
industrial wage. That pledge was never implemented. The new law would offer
wage increases reaching 5 percentage points over the 23 per cent inflation
rate expected for next year. The health service unions say that this is not
enough as already this year their pay is running at 20 per cent below wage
levels in the rest of the economy. President Walesa is widely expected to
veto the entire budget once it is passed by parliament early next year to
win favour with voters before next autumn's presidential elections, which
will see him running for a second term.

Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic yesterday offered a six-point Bosnia

UN officials said Mr Karadzic's proposals were precisely those put to him by
Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy in the Balkans. Mr Akashi said
earlier he had won no commitment from Bosnian Serbs on a ceasefire. Former
US President Jimmy Carter held out the possibility he would go to Bosnia.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General George Joulwan, Nato's senior military commander, has said he may
need up to 45,000 troops backed by three aircraft carriers and as many as 70
extra aircraft to cover a possible withdrawal of United Nations troops from
Bosnia, alliance officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels.
The officials, who asked not to be identified, stressed that Nato defence
ministers, meeting in Brussels, had not approved any final plan to cover a
withdrawal of UN peacekeepers from Bosnia if the world body ordered such a
move. However, they told Reuters that Gen Joulwan, Nato's Supreme Allied
Commander in Europe, had outlined 'worst case' needs for a massive alliance
force in a letter to members countries last Friday.
US officials have said privately that Washington could provide at least half
of such a force to bring out perhaps all of the 23,000 UN forces in Bosnia.
Gen Joulwan wrote that at least seven to nine brigades of troops -
representing 30,000 to 45,000 troops - could be required, including
mechanised infantry, light armour, engineering battalions and at least three
sophisticated communications battalions.
The officials added that Gen Joulwan's letter also called for three aircraft
carriers along with up to 70 additional aircraft and both attack and
reconnaissance helicopters if UN troops had to be removed in a hostile
environment.
One of the officials said it was likely that only one of the three aircraft
carriers would be supplied by the US, suggesting that Britain and France
might supply the others if they were required.
Western diplomats, who also asked not to be identified, said the operation
could cost up to Dollars 270m to begin and Dollars 100m per month once under
way. They said it could require up to 6,000 trucks and Jeeps, 1,600 armoured
vehicles and 180 helicopters.
While alliance defence ministers discussed the potential pull-out at the
start of a two-day meeting yesterday, US officials told journalists earlier
that momentum was growing rapidly among Nato countries to keep UN
peacekeeping troops in Bosnia despite widespread harassment from Bosnian
Serb forces.
The Nato officials said that alliance military officers stressed to defence
ministers at yesterday's meeting that western political leaders had to give
clear guidelines for the scope of any withdrawal if it were ordered by the
UN. 'For example, do we pull out of all of Bosnia or just part of Bosnia?'
asked one official.
They said that Gen Joulwan suggested that the commander of such a protection
force should have control over ports in Croatia in case they were needed for
troop ships to carry UN forces.

UN relief workers yesterday were making a push to get aid through to
Sarajevo, after Bosnian Serb leaders appeared to soften their position,
writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. A spokesman said two convoys, carrying 239
tonnes of food, were heading for Sarajevo, and 13 more were planned for
other parts of Bosnia.
Recent Bosnian Serb restrictions have virtually halted the delivery of
humanitarian aid. But relief workers were hoping to take advantage after
Serbs allowed the passage of a convoy to the Bosnian capital. Their efforts
coincided with signals from Bosnian Serb leaders that they will rejoin the
peace process if the international mediators negotiate directly with them
rather than with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Russian democrats at odds on Chechnya
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The crisis in Chechnya has sharply divided Russian society. It is also
splitting the parliamentary democratic movement which appears torn between
principle and political advantage.
There is little argument among politicians about whether Chechnya is
anything other than an integral part of Russia which must be brought back
into the fold; the differences emerge over how this can be best achieved.
In the Duma, the lower house of parliament, a curious alliance of communists
and liberals has opposed armed intervention. Conversely, Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky's ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic party has unusually found
itself sharing the same platform as the radical pro-reform December 12
Union, headed by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former finance minister, in support
of force. This may prove only a temporary re-orientation of parliamentary
forces which will quickly dissolve when the Duma returns to routine
politics, such as the 1995 budget.
But a more permanent change appears to be overtaking the Duma's biggest
faction, Russia's Democratic Choice, led by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former
prime minister, which has broadly supported President Boris Yeltsin's
policies. Mr Gaidar has been one of the most vocal advocates of a peaceful
solution to the Chechen problem. But his stand has alienated Mr Yeltsin,
jeopardising Russia's Choice's standing in the Duma.
'Until this crisis Gaidar still had one foot in Yeltsin's camp and one foot
out. That has now changed and Russia's Choice will have radically to rethink
its outlook,' says one political analyst.
Mr Gaidar has come under attack within his own faction, too. Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, the foreign minister, has quit the party over its stance on
Chechnya. Mr Oleg Boiko, chairman of its executive committee, has also
criticised the leadership.
Russia's Choice yesterday issued a statement papering over the differences,
stressing the distinction between personal and party views. But few
observers doubt that tensions could re-surface if unrest drags on in the
Caucasus.

<TEXT>
Hungary's privatisation authorities yesterday backed down and agreed to sell
a 51 per cent stake in the country's last state-owned hotel chain to
American General Hospitality, a privately-held US hotel management group.
AGH won the right to negotiate for HungarHotels last month but talks broke
down between the company and the privatisation body after a last-minute
price increase and political pressure to hand over the group to the
cash-strapped social security fund.
The deal, which is due to be signed by mid-January, is only the second large
privatisation to have come up since the new socialist-led government took
office in July and has been viewed as a indication of the new
administration's commitment to privatisation.
The State Property Agency agreed to sell 51 per cent of the chain minus one
hotel for Dollars 57.5m, AGH's original bid for the whole 15-hotel group.
The remaining hotel, which has a book value of Dollars 9m, is to be sold off
with the proceeds going to the SPA, Mr Ferenc Bartha, government
privatisation commissioner said. He said AGH had agreed to invest Dollars
19.5m in the chain over the next three years and not to sell off any of the
hotels during that time. The SPA's remaining 31 per cent stake would be
floated on the Budapest stock exchange.

<TEXT>
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has agreed to
support the Polish government's sale of the Krakow-based Bank Przemyslowo
Handlowy (BPH) with a standby share purchase agreement.
The EBRD has said it would purchase up to 30 per cent of the offer should
the government fail to place the shares. The public offer, which opened last
Monday and runs until January 12, puts 50.2 per cent of the bank's equity on
the market. It is Poland's largest privatisation this year, and is worth at
least 4,130bn zlotys (Dollars 170m).
The sale of BPH, one of Poland's largest banks and the fourth state-owned
bank to be privatised, compares with the 13,800bn zlotys in new share offers
and rights issues taken up by the domestic market in the first
three-quarters of the year.
Mr Krzysztof Kalicki, the deputy finance minister responsible for the sale,
was in London yesterday speaking to foreign investors, who are crucial to
the success of the sale. Morale is low among local small investors, who have
yet to absorb this year's losses following large falls on the stock market
since the spring.
The EBRD has said it would buy the shares at the minimum price of 700,000
zlotys, which gives the bank a price-earnings ratio of 3.8.
The sale of BPH, which had net profits of 1,649bn zlotys for the first nine
months of this year, was set by western governments as a condition of
granting Poland Dollars 600m.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Amtrak axes 5,500 jobs in bid to cut projected Dollars 200m
deficit: Troubled US train operator slashes services as ticket sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amtrak, the US public sector train operator, is cutting about 5,500 jobs and
shutting down 21 per cent of its passenger service in an effort to eliminate
a projected Dollars 200m deficit this fiscal year.
Amtrak said most of the cuts would be in the frequency of train services,
but some routes would be eliminated, including services between Chicago and
Milwaukee, Chicago and Grand Rapids and San Jose to Sacramento and
Roseville, California.
Mr Thomas Downs, Amtrak president, said the system could no longer afford to
maintain its service to 540 cities across the US as a result of a rising
deficit and shrinking ticket sales.
Amtrak admitted earlier this year that it was losing Dollars 33 on every
ticket sold.
Its efficiency record has deteriorated and last year saw the worst accident
in the network's history when 47 people died in a crash on the Los Angeles
to Miami route.
Amtrak lost Dollars 76.2m in fiscal 1994, the fifth straight year it has
been in the red. Passenger numbers fell about 300,000 from the year before.
The rail system has always depended heavily on federal subsidies, this year
worth Dollars 952m.
The cuts announced yesterday are expected to save Dollars 173m in the
current fiscal year, and more than Dollars 360m in 1996 and annually
thereafter.
In addition to the three routes being scrapped, other services will be cut
back, including trains from St Louis to Kansas City, Birmingham to Mobile,
Alabama, and New York to Montreal.
Amtrak, which operates its services on track owned by the private sector,
said it was planning further cuts in the frequency of services, which it
will announce later.
Mr Downs said: 'In the past we have tried to be every place all the time.'
But 'rail passenger services can't afford that anymore . . . in a rapidly
changing transportation environment'.
Decisions on what services to cut and reduce were made 'strictly on what
made economic sense', he said.

The US trade representative is investigating complaints from US banana

suppliers in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of countries, is
discriminatory.
Washington will hold talks with several Caribbean banana exporters in
January over preferential access to the European market. 'The US trade
representative has told us that the investigation will focus on the trade
practices of the EU, and is not directed against the Caribbean exporters,'
said Mr John Compton, the prime minister of St Lucia, the leading exporter
in the Windward Islands. The investigation followed complaints from Chiquita
Brands International, a US company producing bananas in Latin America, and
the Hawaiian Banana Industry Association.
The charge was filed under Section 301 of the US trade act, and was
supported by claims that the EU's import regime, implemented in July 1993,
discriminated against fruit from Latin America. The import regime gives
special access to exporters in the ACP group, about 70 former European
colonies which have a trade treaty with the EU.
In a reversal of policy, the US government said last week that it will not
object to a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade waiver for the Lome
Convention, the trade and aid treaty between the EU and the ACP countries.
This has reduced the threat to the ACP's preferential access to the EU
market.
Officials from other Caribbean exporting countries said that the US trade
representative's statement allowed the region's producers to 'buy some time'
but that the danger to the preferential EU market had not been removed.
The Caribbean Community (Caricom) said the investigation posed a threat to
the Caribbean industry on which many island economies depend.

FT  15 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bid hint sparks Recs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bid fever gripped the regional electricity companies (recs) sector after
international conglomerate Trafalgar House confirmed recent speculation that
it is considering making a takeover bid for Northern Electricity.
The stock moved sharply ahead at the outset fuelled by continued bid talk.
Momentum was lost briefly around midday when Northern said it knew of no
substance for the rumours. Two hours later Trafalgar confirmed that it was
considering a bid and Northern showed a 122p gain before coming off the top
to close a net 100 ahead at 1010p on volume of 4.3m.
Much of the activity was said to have been executed by Swiss Bank Corp,
Trafalgar's advisers, who were thought by rival dealers to have built up a
near 3 per cent stake in Northern over the past few weeks.
Analysts said Trafalgar may have to launch a rights issue to fund the
acquisition. Commentators pointed to 25 per cent stakeholder Hong Kong Land
and its parent Jardine Matheson as possible underwriters.
But one specialist warned that Trafalgar's move was an attempt to take
advantage of Northern's cash position. 'It may find that the regulator might
put a ring fence around the company to prevent it from getting at the cash.'
Another viewed it simply as a way for Hong Kong Land to move funds into the
UK before 1997.
The general view remained that Trafalgar's move is the opening shot in what
is likely to be a long and drawn out battle. Yorkshire, 26 up at 741p, and
Scottish Power, 11 1/2 ahead at 343p, were mentioned as the most likely
white knights. Southern, 30 higher at 786p, was also seen as a possible
contender, as was Hanson, which gained a penny at 228p. A two-way pull in
Trafalgar brought volume of 19m as the shares put on a penny at 72p.
The excitement brought about by the move on Northern Electricity ignited
takeover speculation in the rest of the sector. South West jumped 55 to 843p
and South Wales raced ahead 41 to 827p. Manweb, which reported a 40 per cent
dividend increase, strengthened 51 to 831p on the bid talk.
Composite insurers received a boost from a UBS valuation which landed on
clients' desks yesterday morning and argued that the sector as a whole was
undervalued by 16 per cent.
The research, part of an ongoing model that has been 'back tested' against
performances since 1981, highlighted General Accident. Analyst Mr
Christopher Hitchings commented: 'When we launched the model in the summer,
GA was not good value, but since then it has underperformed massively.' Mr
Hitchings turned buyer of the stock and the shares bounced 22 to 516p.
Elsewhere, Commercial Union gained 18 at 513p, Sun Alliance 10 at 302p and
Guardian Royal Exchange 5 at 176p. Dealers said SGST was also recommending
the sector.
Oil major British Petroleum advanced 9 to 412 1/2 p as investors took heart
from a key presentation to analysts. The profits forecasts matched those
already in place but the market liked the commitment to reduce debts.
Smith New Court was recommending the stock, arguing that the company's
estimates implied gearing of only 37 per cent by 1996, down from 59 per cent
in the third quarter. SGST also came away talking of 'an impressive
performance revealing steady progress'.
Elsewhere in the utilities, shares in Southern Water moved ahead 31 to 570p
after the group reported favourable figures.
Merchant bank SG Warburg finished 14 stronger at 798p, with some dealers
suggesting that an announcement over the possibility of a link with Morgan
Stanley, of the US, would come on Monday.
Until an announcement is made the shares will reflect the various views in
the market over Warburg's potential valuation. Some analysts argue that at
current levels the shares are already at a premium to the fundamental
valuation. Others believe the lower rating of Morgan Stanley will be
countered by Warburg's enhanced earnings and net assets.
Cazenove has apparently been putting the case for Warburg shares to trade
around 700p. However, Credit Lyonnais Laing cites the takeover of Morgan
Grenfell by Deutsche Bank which, at 2.4 times book value, would suggest a
take-out price around Pounds 11. Warburg's fund management arm Mercury Asset
Management rose a further 27 to 745p.
Some concern over Royal Bank of Scotland's insurance arm saw the Scottish
clearer's shares slip 4 1/2 to 399 1/2 p.
Transport group NFC climbed strongly for the second day running, adding 7 at
160p following the purchase of a large line of shares by a board member.
Turnover was 4.1m shares, and the stock has now risen almost 9 per cent in
two sessions.
Newly floated TeleWest Communications hardened to 179 1/2 p in 2.1m turnover
to modestly reverse the recent run of weakness, which at one stage yesterday
left the shares 4 short of their 182p issue price.
Traders suggested that TeleWest had been supported by Kleinwort Benson,
joint issue broker, which has until December 30 to smooth the market in the
shares.
The stock market's feeling was that TeleWest had suffered from a flow-back
from the US tranche of the issue in the wake of the continued weakness of
telecom stocks on Wall Street.
Vodafone added 2 1/2 at 197p in 9m turnover, while BT rounded off an active
day for the sector, rising 4 to 373 1/2 p in 7.3m shares traded.
Building materials leader Caradon recovered following a buy recommendation
from UBS which said the recent derating has left the shares cheap on both
yield and balance sheet criteria. They finished 6 higher at 234p after 3.5m
turnover.
British Steel was the most actively traded Footsie stock, ending 3 3/4 ahead
at 156 3/4 p in turnover of 14m. Similarly, British Aerospace regained all
and more of Tuesday's sell-off, rising 7 1/2 to 427 1/2 p, with Kleinwort
Benson placing the 3m shares not taken up within the recent rights issue.
Among smaller engineering stocks, Whessoe forged ahead 15 to 121p for a
two-day advance of 22p.
Food manufacturer Cadbury-Schweppes receded 5 to 404p in heavy trading of
7.7m shares, with Hoare Govett, the group's broker, cutting current year
profits expectations. BZW also reduced its forecast but remains a buyer.
Shares in train set manufacturer Hornby hit the buffers after the USM-quoted
company issued a profits warning. The stock fell 50 to 127p.
Brokers' downgradings left furniture group MFI trailing 2 1/2 at 122p.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures moved ahead strongly in improved turnover, with the
session marked by the almost complete absence of selling pressure, writes
Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract had reached 2,978 at the close of pit
trading, while the March contract was at 2,997. The gains were 39 and 42
points respectively.
December's discount to the cash market was two points, or four points under
fair value, while March closed at a 17-point premium, or five points short
of fair value.
Dealers said there was good steady business throughout the session, with
active participation by a number of the bigger houses, notably NatWest
Securities and GNI.
Trading volume rose to 17,425 lots for the December contract and 10,706 for
March, of which more than 8,000 were thought to be the result of spread
trading.
There were few attempts to apply direction to the cash market, but dealers
said sentiment showed a clear improvement. At one stage the March contract
traded above 3,000.
Traded option turnover improved to 43,329 lots, from 39,329 on Tuesday.
FT-SE and Euro FT-SE business accounted for more than 29,000 contracts.
The most active individual option was Tesco, followed by British Gas and BT.
Tesco saw 1,930 lots dealt.

FT  15 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie poised to attack 3,000 after
bid move - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK market shrugged aside a series of disappointing economic numbers from
both sides of the Atlantic, preferring to latch on to news of a probable bid
for Northern Electricity from Trafalgar House.
'A bid from Trafs for Northern seems certain to trigger a series of bids and
counter-bids in the sector, and will drive the market sharply higher by the
end of the year,' said the head of trading at one of the City's biggest
securities houses.
Speculation of stakebuilding and possible bids has been rife in the
electricity sector for a number of weeks. Northern Electricity shares began
to outpace the rest of the sector as long as a month ago as the stories
began to take hold. And Northern issued a statement to the market around
midday - two hours before the Trafalgar news broke - saying it knew of no
substance to the bid speculation of recent days.
At the close the FT-SE 100 Index was 34.2 higher at 2,980.6 and looking set
fair to attack the 3,000 level, dealers said. The bid news in the recs
ignited the rest of the market, where the second liners jumped for joy. The
FT-SE Mid 250 Index climbed 32.4 to 3,405.7.
The equity market was up and running long before the Northern/Trafalgar news
was released, with rumours of bids in the utilities, merchant banks and
other sectors being talked around the trading desks. Wall Street's steady
showing overnight gave added impetus to European markets.
The FT-SE 100 opened firmer at 2,950.2 and made rapid progress throughout
the day, pausing only to ponder what were seen as marginally disappointing
inflation numbers and average earnings.
A headline inflation figure showing a rise of 2.6 per cent on an annualised
basis compared with estimates of around 2.5 per cent, while average earnings
were in line with forecasts. The market was encouraged by the 1.7 per cent
fall in unit wage costs in the latest three months.
With Wall Street opening in good shape and up more than 13 points within
minutes in the face of consumer price index numbers and capacity utilisation
figures broadly in line with expectations, London gathered itself for
another sharp advance.
The Northern Electricity news, plus a good opening by Wall Street, which
jumped 13 points on the Dow Industrial Average in spite of slightly
disappointing inflation news, injected a massive dose of enthusiasm into
London, which raced ahead during the afternoon.
One dealer said that although the market had been full of bid speculation,
the actual timing of the Northern news caught marketmakers on the wrong
foot. 'The market was generally short and got caught,' he said, adding that
the feeling was now that the bid fever would probably feed into other
sectors. He also pointed out that the expiry on Friday of a whole series of
derivatives instruments, in the UK as well as Germany and the US, would
trigger all sorts of exaggerated market swings; 'We are going to see some
fun and games and possibly some jiggery-pokery in the market on Friday,' he
added.
Another senior dealer said he envisaged 'open season in the recs and the
merchant banks which will drive the market higher; the only worry for London
comes from Wall Street, which many see as heading for a fall'.
There were plenty of other stories circulating in the market. Dealers said
they expected firm details on the SG Warburg/Morgan Stanley merger
discussions to emerge on Monday, with Warburg shares racing up again. BP
shares performed exceptionally well after a well received presentation to
analysts.
Standard Chartered was one of the Footsie's most disappointing performers,
the shares being upset by yet more hints that Lloyds Bank's 4.7 per cent
stake may soon be on the move.

FT  15 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Inflation indications leave
equities higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US shares rose solidly yesterday as relatively mild economic statistics
encouraged investors that the Federal Reserve would not lift interest rates
next week, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 30.95 at 3,746.29. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 advanced 4.82 to 454.97, the
American Stock Exchange composite rose 2.84 to 423.07 and the Nasdaq
composite gained 6.17 at 725.66. Volume on the New York SE amounted to 355m
shares.
Inflation has yet to seep into final goods prices, according to figures
released by the Labor Department showing that the consumer price index rose
0.3 per cent in November, putting inflation for the year at 2.7 per cent.
The core CPI, excluding volatile food and energy prices, was up only 0.2 per
cent, less than economists had predicted.
Although the Fed has focused on rising industrial production and
intermediate prices in determining its monetary policy, the low CPI figures
led some investors to believe that there would be no interest rate increase
at the December 20 meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee meeting.
In recent weeks the market has been skittish as investors worried that more
tightening by the Fed would dampen earnings growth, but yesterday the Dow
rose more than 40 points in the afternoon before slipping back by the close.
Also reassuring to the market was the fact that there were no surprises in
yesterday's capacity utilisation or industrial production figures. Capacity
utilisation - the percentage of capital being used in the economy for the
production of goods - grew to 84.7 per cent, its highest level in more than
five years.
Although utilisation figures of 82 to 85 per cent are generally considered
signals of future inflation, the data did not rattle the market because it
was well within the range of expectations.
Total production grew by 0.5 per cent in November, matching October's
figure, which was revised downwards.
Shares in cyclical companies received a boost as fears were eased of another
interest rate increase, with the Morgan Stanley index of cyclical stocks
rising 1.6 per cent. Dow Chemical moved ahead Dollars 3 to Dollars 66 7/8 ,
Caterpillar Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 52 3/8 , Motorola Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 56 and International Paper Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 72 1/2 .
Sprint gained Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 30 3/4 after the US telecommunications
company announced that it would form a long-distance venture with Telmex,
the Mexican telephone monopoly.
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the US pharmaceuticals group which is majority owned by
Rhone-Poulenc, of France, extended Tuesday's slide, dipping Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 37 1/4 . The shares fell 8 per cent on Tuesday after US regulators
recommended against giving the company early approval for a new cancer drug.
Other pharmaceuticals stocks were mixed. Eli Lilly put on Dollars  5/8 at
Dollars 62 1/8 . Canada
Toronto put on a good performance as US economic data helped to ease
inflation fears. Strong showings by heavily weighted banking, consumer and
industrial products stocks gave a boost to the TSE 300 composite index in a
day of broadly based gains.
The index finished 34.44 higher at 4,078.85 and advances outscored declines
by 416 to 370 after volume of 64.8m shares. Twelve of the 14 sub-group
indices were up, with only real estate and pipeline issues posting losses.
Mexico
The market lost an initial rise to end slightly lower on balance, taking its
decline to a fifth straight session, on unconfirmed local reports of
scattered shooting between the army and rebels in the state of Chiapas.
The reports, filed by local news wire Infosel and uncorroborated by other
local services, hit an already nervous market and cut heavily into an early
gain booked by telephone giant Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex).
Telmex's rise was initiated by Tuesday's late news that an accord had been
signed between Sprint, of the US, and Telmex on the provision of
long-distance telephone services between the two countries. Even though
Telmex was trading at a 12-month low on the opening, the Chiapas situation
proved too much for the market to handle, dealers said.
The IPC index was 6.44 points down on the day at 2,401.55. Volume totalled a
light 497m new pesos on 40m shares traded. Telmex 'L' series shares - those
available to foreign investors - closed a net 4 centavos up at 8.9 new
pesos, after surging 2.5 per cent at the opening.

<TEXT>
Equity trading in Manila has been difficult over the past few weeks, with
the composite index testing, and holding, the 2,500 support level, writes
John Pitt.
Asia Equity notes that volumes have been in decline since the end of
November and that, in common with the region, the market's direction has
been determined by events in the US, particularly in relation to interest
rate moves.
Looking ahead, May 1995 sees the first parliamentary elections for three
years. Asia Equity has a positive view on the outcome of the race for the
senate, which should consolidate the presidency of Mr Fidel Ramos, and
expedite the passage of economic reform measures through congress.
With regard to Latin America, James Capel has turned optimistic on
Argentina, one of the worst performing markets in that region during 1994 in
dollar terms. Mr Nigel Rendell argues that the downward spiral has come to
an end - the Merval index is currently some 25 to 30 per cent below its 1994
peak - and stocks look cheap on a 1995 earnings forecast of 12 times, in
relation to Mexico (13.7 times) and Brazil (14.3 times).
'However, rising US interest rates, concerns about capital inflows and an
element of political uncertainty are likely to limit any gains in the Merval
index,' adds Mr Rendell. In conclusion, he still recommends underweighting
Argentina within a Latin American portfolio, 'believing that other markets,
in particular Mexico, Brazil, Chile and Peru, provide a better upside
potential, at least for the time being'.

FT  15 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris bourse majors on RPR
setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weaker than expected US core rate CPI and capacity utilisation data gave
bourses an afternoon lift, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS saw the CAC-40 index add 12.91 at 1,930.02, but attention was fixed on
Rhone-Poulenc, whose US pharmaceuticals unit, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, suffered
a major setback on Tuesday night when the US FDA advisory committee rejected
its Taxotere drug for the treatment of breast and lung cancer.
In Paris, RPR dropped FFr19.70 or 9 per cent to FFr197.50, after a session's
low of FFr190.60, while Rhone-Poulenc, after falling to FFr120.90, steadied
and closed with a loss of 60 centimes at FFr124 in heavy volume.
The effect on RPR's earnings would be considerable, commented Ms Virginia
Pascoe, European pharmaceuticals analyst at UBS in London, given that the
company had been pinning its hopes on Taxotere for entry into the global
market for cancer treatment. This setback could mean that a US launch would
be delayed until the fourth quarter of 1997, following a reapplication to
the US authorities.
Euro Disney, up 25 centimes at FFr9.60, was supported by news that it was to
cut ticket prices for entry to the theme park in an effort to boost
attendance.
AMSTERDAM set a slide in the aircraft manufacturer Fokker against a rise in
KPN, the heavily capitalised telecommunications group. The AEX index closed
0.38 higher at 407.19.
Fokker, in which Daimler, of Germany, has a majority stake, sank to a year's
low of Fl 12.10 during the day, before picking up slightly to close off Fl
2.20 or 15 per cent at Fl 12.30. This slide followed a further downgrading
by the group of its 1994 earnings forecast, and brings the year's share
price drop to nearly 51 per cent since it hit a peak of Fl 25 in late
January.
KPN, in contrast, rose 80 cents to Fl 55.60 on news late on Tuesday which
confirmed that its Unisource telecommunications joint venture was to link up
AT&amp;T, of the US, with plans to invest up to Dollars 1bn building up a
European telecoms network.
FRANKFURT moved from an official Dax close of 2,024.77 to an Ibis indicated
2,040.94 by the end of the day, up 21.81 over 24 hours. Turnover rose from
DM4.8bn to DM5bn.
Commerzbank, scheduled to produce forecasts for the bourse in 1995, put on
DM6 at DM326.80 as Schroder, Munchmeyer &amp; Hengst said that an expected
recovery in bank stocks would help the Dax hit the top of a 2,000 to 2,400
range by mid-1995.
But cyclicals, not favoured by SMH, won the day. The big three chemicals
moved up as a group, Hoechst leading with a rise of DM6.40 to DM316.60.
Elsewhere there was selective buying in Deutsche Babcock, up DM4.50 at
DM202.50, and Daimler, DM20.20 better at DM740.50 after it said that its
1994 operating profits would at least double the DM926m of the first six
months.
MILAN closed under further pressure as growing political tensions and
end-account position squaring pushed prices lower. The Comit index rose 1.27
to 582.91 but the real-time Mibtel index fell another 157 or 1.7 per cent to
9,279.
Olivetti was L29 higher at L1,893 after European Union criticism of the
government's decision to charge the Omnitel cellular telephone consortium
for its licence.
Ambroveneto shed L95 to L4,371 after Tuesday's meeting of shareholders
appeared to rule out any shake-up in its controlling group.
ZURICH featured a SFr13 recovery to SFr1,084 in UBS bearers, still down 9.9
per cent since the end of September when the board joined its battle for
influence with Mr Martin Ebner. The SMI rose 15.4 to 2,581.
Nestle picked up SFr10 to SFr1,254 after Credit Suisse revised upwards its
earnings estimates for the coming three years. The forecasts were cut
temporarily after Nestle excluded specific US sales from its 10-month sales
figures.
Roche certificates rose SFr100 to regain the SFr6,000 level for the first
time since September 23, supported by news that its US subsidiary Roche
Biomedical was to merge its laboratory business with National Health to form
a new company with annual revenues of about Dollars 1.7bn.
BRUSSELS saw the Bel-20 index up 5.53 at 1,385.86, but this excluded Arbed,
which fell BFr140 to BFr4,780. The Luxembourg-based steelmaker took a
cautious view of 1995 prospects after the market closed on Tuesday.
STOCKHOLM ended lower after pressure on bank shares, which fell 2 per cent
as the Affarsvarlden General index eased 4.10 to 1,463.80. Svenska
Handelsbanken 'B' declined SKr2 to SKr98, and S-E-Banken 'A' by SKr1.10 to
SKr43.30 in spite of a denial by the Swedish government that it planned some
form of new tax on the industry.
VIENNA eased in light trade, with the ATX index down 3.27 to 1,026.83. But
Economos soared Sch111 to Sch525 as trading resumed after a two-month
suspension, the latter prompted by comments by the seal and washer maker
that it was facing a liquidity crisis due to non-payment of debts by
customers.

FT  15 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei firm as Kuala
Lumpur surges 4.1%

<TEXT>
Equities moved ahead slightly in a technical correction to Tuesday's
decline, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average improved 56.01 to 18,931.49 in volume estimated at
220m shares, little changed from the previous day's 218.65m. The index moved
narrowly between 18,957.59 and 18,887.68 during the day.
The first-section Topix index edged up 0.37 to 1,498.04, while the
capital-weighted Nikkei 300 firmed 0.30 to 276.79. Falls outnumbered rises
by 524 to 415, with 226 issues flat and 73 stocks at their lows for the
year. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 2.01 at 1,248.66.
The market enjoyed early gains on a combination of arbitrage buying due to
steadiness in Chicago futures overnight and buy orders placed by one life
insurance company. A sharp rebound in the Hong Kong market softened
otherwise bearish sentiment that prevailed throughout the day.
Manufacturers of semiconductor production equipment were mostly firmer on
reports of sharply higher earnings for four leading companies in the year to
March 31. Advantest, Kokusai Electric and Tokyo Electron all edged up Y10 to
Y3,200, Y1,820, and Y3,030 respectively. Nikon receded Y8 to Y908.
Higher prices for cotton yarns gave textiles a boost. Nitto Boseki added Y8
at Y270 and Toyobo Y5 at Y382.
Major steel producers were lifted by foreign repurchasing and institutional
buying. One-half of the day's 10 most active stocks were steel groups:
Nippon Steel rose Y8 to Y357, its first gain in five trading days, Sumitomo
Metal ticked up Y1 to Y308, Kobe Steel firmed Y3 to Y303 and Kawasaki Steel
put on Y4 at Y397. But NKK, the day's volume leader, was off Y1 at Y264.
After four consecutive losing days, Japan Tobacco retrieved Y1,000 at
Y907,000, but most traders agreed that the stock had yet to show evidence of
bottoming. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained Y5,000 at Y838,000.
East Japan Railway dipped Y2,000 to Y469,000, while Odakyu Electric Rail
held at Y707 in the day's fourth highest volume of 3.5m shares.
In Osaka, the OSE average edged down 19.20 to 20,738.49 in volume of 74.2m
shares.
Roundup
Renewed strength was seen in some Pacific Rim markets.
KUALA LUMPUR surged 4.1 per cent, its largest single-day gain since January
14, helped by strong fund buying of blue chip stocks. The composite index
rose 36.74 to 937.15, Brokers noted concerted buying by local and
Singaporean institutions, led by the Malaysian investment house Permodalan
Nasional.
SINGAPORE firmed on bargain hunting and the Straits Times Industrial index
rose 24.68 or 1.2 per cent to 2,114.00. Demand for Malaysian shares traded
over the counter took the UOB OTC index up by 28.45 or 2.7 per cent to
1,072.37.
HONG KONG advanced for a second day as late European institutional buying
overcame bad news from the local property market when a plot of land was
withdrawn from a government auction for lack of bidders. The Hang Seng index
was up 147.60 or 1.9 per cent at 7,997.35 after touching 8,029.56.
Jardine Strategic rose HKDollars 1.55 or 6.1 per cent to HKDollars 26.80 and
Hong Kong Electric added HKDollars 1.40 or 7.3 per cent at HKDollars 20.50.
SYDNEY was revived by the 1 percentage point rise in domestic interest rates
which had been widely anticipated. The All Ordinaries index ended 10.1 ahead
at 1,862.8, after 1,865.0, in turnover of ADollars 448m.
Leading banks saw continued support on a switch out of regional banks and on
firmer profits prospects for the coming 12 months.
SEOUL closed flat in thin trading after a tug-of-war between rebounding blue
chips and broad selling of smaller-capitalised shares; the composite index
gained 0.72 at 1,026.61.
BOMBAY recovered some ground after two days of heavy losses, on renewed
buying interest among mutual funds.
The BSE 30-share index recouped 31.42 at 3,861.47 after the 135-point drop
in the previous two days which followed the Congress party rout in regional
elections at the weekend.
MANILA focused on a debut issue, Southeast Asia Cement Holdings, which
forged ahead 23 per cent from its offer price of 1.50 pesos, while the
composite index settled 2.69 easier at 2,617.90. Turnover expanded to 1.54bn
pesos from Tuesday's 902.53m.
BANGKOK weakened on foreign selling, particularly in the telecommunications
sector. The SET index lost 25.51 at 1,280.07 in turnover of Bt4.2bn.
The telecommunications sector index fell 4.75 per cent in turnover of
Bt807.2m.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Interest rate optimism gives boost to US
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Eurodollar futures rose sharply yesterday as fears of a rise in US interest
rates next week receded, writes Philip Gawith.
This helped prices across the yield curve, with the March Eurodollar
contract climbing to 92.76 from 92.62.
Markets had been discounting the possibility of the Federal Reserve lifting
rates when it meets next Tuesday.
The dollar weakened slightly to end in London at DM1.5691, from DM1.5728,
and at Y100.26 from Y100.395. New York trading closed with the US currency
at DM1.5690 and Y100.30.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar finished unchanged at 77.52 US cents.
Earlier it had touched a three-year high of 77.8 cents, during Asian
trading, after the Reserve Bank raised interest rates by 100 basis points to
7.5 per cent.
Sterling lost  1/2 pfennig against the stronger D-Mark, closing at DM2.4513
from DM2.4569, but was unchanged against the dollar at Dollars 1.5622.
The D-Mark maintained its firmer showing in Europe, but there was little
significant movement in rates. The peseta eased to Pta84.13 against the
D-Mark from Pta84.0.
The catalyst for the performance of US interest rate markets was better than
expected consumer inflation and capacity utilisation figures.
The view that an increase in US interest rates might be deferred caused a
short-covering rally in D-Mark and short sterling futures. The March short
sterling contract gained five basis points at 92.55, while the same D-Mark
contract moved upwards to 94.30 from 94.27. Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at
broker GNI, remarked: 'The Americans have given us the lead today and we
have eagerly taken it.'
Volumes were very heavy, with the March Eurodollar contract having some
200,000 lots dealt. One trader commented on the buoyant state of the market,
noting: 'Every single trade I did today was a buy - either short-covering,
or book tidying ahead of Christmas.'
Mr Jonathan Griggs, economic adviser at Barclays in London, said sentiment
had also been affected by the publication of a report in Washington saying
interest rates would not be raised next week. The report came from a
consultancy reputed to have close ties to the Federal Reserve.
Not everyone shares this sanguine view about next week's meeting. Mr Wayne
Angell, chief economist at Bear Stearns, and until recently a Fed governor
himself, said a 50 basis-point rise in rates 'seems logical'.
Along the same lines, Mr David Munro, chief US economist at High Frequency
Economics in New York, has increased the odds of a rate rise next week to
even money following the release of retail sales data earlier this week.
He believes the Fed is more focused on retail sales as current evidence that
the economy is heating up, than on producer prices, which are a backward
looking indicator.
The Australian dollar's progress is the function of rising interest rates
and buoyant commodity prices. Commodity exports are an important dimension
of the Australian economy.
The currency also benefited from the surprise element in yesterday's move.
Most traders in the market had been expecting interest rates to rise last
week. The outlook is for further rises in interest rates, which should help
the dollar. One economist noted: 'There is mounting concern about the
sustainability of economic growth. This could force the Reserve Bank to push
rates even higher.'
Rising economic growth next year in the industrial world should bolster
commodity prices, lending further support to the Australian dollar. Many
analysts expect the currency to rise to 80 US cents during 1995.
The D-Mark continued to profit from political worries in Europe - notably in
Italy and France, and also in the UK ahead of today's Dudley West
by-election. The latest opinion poll gave the opposition Labour party an
almost unheard of 50 percentage-point lead. This put the pound under some
pressure against the D-Mark.
Analysts said the US dollar's ability to remain reasonably firm while the
D-Mark was also strong showed that investors were switching between
currencies in Europe, rather than between the dollar and the D-Mark.
The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 1.3bn shortage at established rates in
its daily money market operations.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Arab Banking (13): Women find their role - A
transformation in Tunisia's business scene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many Tunisians regard a group of laws which, in 1956, abolished polygamy and
gave their womenfolk rights not enjoyed elsewhere in the Arab world, as one
of their country's proudest achievements.
The 'Personal Status Code' is arguably former President Habib Bourguiba's
greatest single achievement. The rights granted to Tunisian women have been
further consolidated since Mr Zine El Abidine Ben Ali became president in
1987.
The efforts to promote education, health and family planning have produced
clearly visible results - population growth is down to 1.9 per cent a year
and two-thirds of all Tunisian women are now literate. Furthermore, women
are increasingly visible in a wide variety of professions - in teaching,
medicine, architecture and in factories as workers, engineers and managers.
Today, women have 25 per cent of all jobs in Tunisia, 35 per cent of jobs in
industry and 40 per cent in agriculture.
Increasingly, they own and manage new businesses. A minor revolution is
afoot as the number of new companies founded by women in Tunisia has risen
from 7 per cent of the total in 1985 to 13 per cent this year.
Most of these companies are small, with less than 10 employees, but others
are much larger and often engage in international trade in a manner which
was quite unthinkable only a decade ago.
It does not come as a surprise that 73 per cent of all companies owned by
women are found in the textile sector. That is true in other developing
countries but the quality of some of what is produced in this sector and the
sheer size of some investments points to change.
Leila Boufaid, whose husband is a senior magistrate, started a small luxury
braid business 20 years ago. Today, she employs 200 workers, has a turnover
of Dollars 1.8m. Around 90 per cent of its output is exported to Europe and
the US.
Maille Fil which opened in 1989 is a Dollars 20m investment by Hedi
Bouchamaoui for his four daughters, two of whom manage Tunisia's largest
combed cotton and yarn production plant. The company imports cotton from the
US and produces 3,000 tons of high quality fabric a year, 75 per cent of
which is exported. While two daughters oversee the factory, the others are
completing their studies at university in Michigan.
Meanwhile, women in Tunisia are now branching out into other spheres of
business. Saida Mechri worked in a security company after gaining a degree
in economics in Belgium. In 1988 she started her own company, Securitap,
which employs 800 people, 700 of whom are security agents hired out to
embassies and companies across the country and boasting an annual turnover
of Dollars 1.7m. More recently she started a haute couture business which
employs 10 designers and sells styles to Italy. She readily confesses that
the company, called Tosca, is her 'true love.'
There are other diverse examples of successful women in business. Hayet
Laouani, for instance, started as secretary in a shipping company, 20 years
ago. Now she owns and runs Stumar, a company with a turnover of Dollars 3m
and is active in stevadoring, conveyancing and forwarding.
Rashida Rouissi is a leading exporter of citrus products and is doing battle
with the Marseilles suppliers who have a tight grip on the bulk of Tunisian
exports, especially citrus fruit, 89 per cent of which was, until recently,
shipped through the French port. Ms Rouissi has, however, succeeded in
exporting ever-larger quantities of citrus fruit through Toulon, thus
cutting freight and other costs. Her battle is not merely with Marseilles
shippers but with well-established Tunisians who have lived comfortably off
their links with the French port.
Alya Heda runs Opalia, a joint venture with an Italian businessman which
makes pharmaceutical products under licence from Alfa Wasserman and Amuchina
of Italy. Among the hundred doctors and pharmacists who work for her, eighty
are women. Pharmaceutical exports to African countries are flourishing and
she hopes soon to break into the European market.
Selma Rekik is the financial controller of the Chebika Group, owned by her
father and brothers. Among the group's key activities is the manufacture of
electrical items for cars - Peugeot, Renault, Mercedes and Opel are clients.
She has recently acquired a 40-year lease on a former state farm, the Stifen
domaine, north-east of Tunis and is busy developing rich farmland where
earlier lack of investment over a generation all but ended production. All
the fruit and vegetables produced will be exported to Europe. Like other
women entrepreneurs, she started in business after marrying and raising
children; her husband is one of Tunisia's leading ophthalmists.
A study conducted last year by Aziza Dargouth, who runs the CPS consulting
agency, suggests that 48 per cent of women who start their own business find
little difficulty in reconciling their professional and family obligations,
that 43 per cent ventured into such activities for the sake of the challenge
it offered, that only one husband in five is opposed to his wife's
activities. Such findings do not conform to a widespread European stereotype
of Arab women.
This new breed of innovative women owner-managers work hard, often more
diligently than menfolk and is prepared to do battle with the civil service
which, despite the efforts to liberalise the management of the economy
launched in 1986, remains a worthy successor of its Turkish and French
forebears. A Tunisian businesswoman jokes that edicts of the central bank
are 'as difficult to interpret as the Holy Koran itself . . . and spawn
quite as many hadiths (the body of comments on the Koran).'
Such rules, in her view, should be clearly written and implemented with
speed and honesty.
Though some women run large companies, the bulk of such businesses employ 10
people or less and are often run from home.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Arab Banking (12): A step in the right direction -
Case study, financial enterprise in Morocco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In September 1993, Upline Securities, then a little-known firm of financial
intermediaries in Casablanca, found that a private Moroccan shareholder, the
Al Amane Insurance Company, wished to sell the 4 per cent stake it held in
the capital of ONA, the kingdom's largest private company, whose chief
executive is King Hassan's son-in-law, Mr Fouad Filali.
That stake was worth Dollars 15m and entitled its owner to a seat on the ONA
board. Upline Securities subsequently sold the stake to Baring Securities in
London which, in turn, sold it to a group of institutional investors. That
'coup' landed a small band of enterprising Moroccans on to the front page of
the Morocco's economic and financial weekly, L'Economiste.
Upline International was founded in January 1993 by Jalal Houti and Hassan
Aitali - both aged 30. Jalal Houti had returned two years previously from
nine years in the US, where he graduated at the business school in Austin,
Texas; meanwhile, Hassan Aitali had graduated at the business school of the
Universite Libre de Belgique.
Jalal Houti joined the the Banque Marocaine pour le Commerce et l'Industrie
where he worked in correspondent banking. He was the only person who spoke
English in that department of BMCI and soon realised the interest that banks
such as JP Morgan, First Chicago and Chase Mahattan had in trading Moroccan
debt in the secondary market. Hassan Aitali joined the Moroccan subsidiary
of AT &amp; T, Networking Computing Resources.
In November 1992, Jalal Houti left BMCI and became a consultant - to a US
bank - on the Moroccan economy. Then, in January 1993, both friends started
a weekly report which, by mid-year, had a dozen institutional investor
subscribers in London and New York. Today it boasts 50 subscribers.
Both men realised that foreign investors were showing greater interest in
Morocco because, by late 1992, the much-heralded privatisation programme was
finally under way. Foreign banks and funds were hampered, however, by the
lack of up-to-date information on the country. Hence, their decision to
start a series of sector and company studies - reports which are common in
London and Paris, but were the first of their kind in Morocco.
Last month, Upline Securities, which now has a staff of eight traders and
financial analysts, all between the ages of 23 and 32, won their seat on the
Casablanca stock exchange - a seat worth having since the Casablanca stock
exchange is no longer an old fashioned, rather clubbable place where nothing
much goes on.
Up to 1991, most of the activity on the stock exchange was in government
bonds. Now, however, the faster pace of privatisation, new share issues and
the increasing flow of foreign investment have transformed the place and
equities now account for 95 per cent of all trading.
Upline Securities is capitalised today at Dh1m, 47.5 per cent of which was
bought by the French broker Finacor in December 1993. Turnover last year
amounted to Dollars 30m, a figure which is expected to rise to Dollars 50m
in 1994. By world standards, such amounts are small, but the drive and
enthusiasm shown by this young Morrocan team is a pointer to the big changes
being wrought in a highly conservative banking and stockbroking community,
many of whose senior members, who belong to the Groupement Professionel des
Banques du Maroc, seem more than a little reticent about the reforms
currently being promoted by King Hassan.
Meanwhile, Upline Securities' aims to combine stockbroking and market
research in corporate finance. A seat on the Casablanca stock exchange is
thus a step in the right direction.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Arab Banking (11): Quiet revolution under way -
Ambitious privatisation programme in Morocco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For many international banks and investment funds, the privatisation of the
Societe National d'Investissements (SNI) marked a watershed in Morocco's
ambitious privatisation programme.
The selling of 66.64 per cent of the state's share in the capital of this
holding company, whose interests range from cement to drinks and the
financial sector, netted Dh2.03bn (Pounds 145m). This represents twice the
amount brought in July 1993, when the state sold a 51 per cent stake in the
CIOR cement company to a French subsidiary of the Swiss Holderbank group.
The sale of SNI shares was split three ways: 35 per cent of SNI shares were
sold to Moroccan institutional investors, who cannot sell them for five
years; and 16 per cent to Moroccan and foreign institutional investors. The
remaining 15.64 per cent were floated on the Casablanca stock exchange where
they were over-subscribed eight times.
Critics were many, however. The authorities decided to float 15.64 per cent
of the shares on the Casablanca stock exchange during the first week in
November at Dh300 a share, to encourage institutions to bid a higher price.
SNI shares had been suspended at Dh425 a few days earlier.
Trading resumed before the sale to institutional investors had been
completed. The minimum sale price per share for institutions set by the
commission which overseas privatisation operations was Dh325. Successfull
bidders effectively bought the shares at Dh425.
Furthermore, bankers in London and Casablanca described the back-room
operations of the Banque Populaire, which was the agent, as a 'shambles.'
However, the broad success of the sale means that that the country's
privatisation drive is more or less on track but the quick gains realised by
some private investors smacked of speculation - not the kind of impression
the authorities wish to give if this selling of 'the family silver' is to
find wide acceptance in Morocco.
Privatisation this year has so far brought in USDollars 230m, a figure which
could well increase if the state goes ahead with its proclaimed intention of
selling its 50 per cent stake in Morocco's second largest commercial bank,
Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur. That sale is expected to generate no
less than Pounds 76.5m. This operation is not expected to be completed
before the end of the year: when completed, it will push up the proceeds of
privatisation to twice the Pounds 193m level reached in 1993.
The privatisation programme launched in 1992 is a little late on initial
targets which had suggested that 112 companies worth an estimated Pounds
1.3bn would be privatised by the end of next year. There is no mistaking,
however, the quiet revolution which the sales of shares from state companies
is bringing into a hitherto very cosseted and closed world of banking and
share transactions.
Direct foreign investment in Morocco has risen steadily since 1987 to Pounds
349m last year and is expected to top Pounds 616m this year. Trading on the
Casablanca exchange has already more than doubled so far this year and is
expected to top the Pounds 640m mark by year-end.
The Overall Share Index shows a 28 per cent increase so far this year,
equivalent to last year's rise.
Nonetheless, the stock exchange does boast some very illiquid shares, making
the Moroccan market more attractive for wealthy investors rather than
individuals.
There are three ways to invest in Morocco - through a country fund, which
often includes Morocco and Tunisia, through an Africa or Middle East fund
with weighting in Morocco or through the purchase of individual shares.
Privatisation has encouraged the emergence of investment funds, the first
two of which, Sud-Mediterranee et Maroc Privatisation are worth Pounds 6m
each, were launched early last year by Societe Marseillaise de Credit and
are managed by its Generale de Placement subsidiary, GP Bank.
Three of the largest funds include the Pounds 39m Morocco Fund, which is
jointly owned by ONA, the kingdom's largest private company, and Salomon
Brothers; the Pounds 15m Interfina fund, jointly owned by by three Moroccan
banks, the International Finance Corporation and Spain's Banco Exterior,
Credit Lyonnais Investissement; and BMCE and a fund jointly set up by
Framlington, which is a subsidiary of Credit Commercial de France and Morgan
Stanley Africa Investment Fund.
ONA has further contributed to the modernisation of Morocco's financial
system by a capital increase last year which took the form of the
largest-ever share issue in Morocco, worth Dollars 120m. (Wafa bank earlier
that year raised its capital with the first ever public share issue in
Morocco).
The company also allowed foreign investors to buy into its capital. A third
of its capital is now owned by such well-known names as Morgan Stanley,
Lehman Brothers, Paribas, BSN Danone and Assurances Generales de France. Mr
George Soros bought a 2 per cent stake last April for Dollars 40m.
Last year, ONA was the first Moroccan borrower to raise a euroloan since the
kingdom's debt was rescheduled in 1983. It raised Dollars 30m through
Citibank. A further operation of this kind in the near future is not ruled
out.
Faster progress in liberalising the management of Morocco's financial sector
is being handicapped, however, by three factors. The first is the absence of
money and foreign exchange markets which is affecting both foreign investors
and Moroccan businessmen and bankers.
The second factor is the impossibility of foreign exchange hedging. The
World Bank and the IMF have been pressing the Moroccan government on both
counts for a least two years, but the Banque al Maghrib, the central bank,
appears to be dragging its feet while many Moroccan banks appear comfortably
set in their old-fashioned ways and fearful of change.
For decades, their unwritten contract with the central bank has involved
financing large government deficits in exchange for comfortable margins on
their other business. With an estimated Dollars 500m-Dollars 600m deficit in
government financing written into next year's budget, the banks have plenty
of reasons to continue in their old ways.
More recently, a further element of uncertainty has been introduced. King
Hassan suggested, when he opened parliament last October, that the time
might be ripe for the government of technocrats - headed by the highly
respected minister of foreign affairs, Mr Abdellatif Fillali - which has
been running the country's affairs for 18 months, to give way to a more
political cabinet. Such a government would be based on the alliance of the
old nationalist Istiqlal party and the socialist Union Socialiste des Forces
Populaires.
Doubts already being expressed about the ability, let alone the willingness
of such a government, which public opinion has already nicknamed 'Jurassic
Parc,' to pursue the path of economic reform. Neither party has made public
an economic platform which addresses the problems of modern Morocco and
their leaders more often than not appear caught in an economic time warp.
Many Moroccans believe that politicians alone can do the 'hard sell' which
is essential if the progress made in modernising the economic and financial
sectors are to be consolidated. They also take comfort from King Hassan's
public declarations that there is no going back on the reforms launched a
decade ago.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Arab Banking (7): Call for greater innovation -
United Arab Emirates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Capital increases over the last two years have brought most Gulf Arab banks
above the eight per cent capital-to-risk-weighted assets guidelines set in
1988 by the Basel committee of the Bank for International Settlements. The
average capital-to-assets ratio of the top 30 Gulf banks at the end of last
September stood at 11.96 per cent.
However, other issues of supervision and control still cause concern to
central banks. So much so, say many Gulf bankers, that Gulf monetary and
other authorities are ignoring important areas that affect Gulf financial
institutions' long-term interests.
Two recent conferences illustrate these contrasting attitudes. In the first,
central bank auditors from the Arab League's 22 countries meeting in Abu
Dhabi at the end of November under the auspices of the Arab Monetary Fund,
showed how monetary authorities are still pre-occupied with banking
supervision and haunted by other problems left over from past crises,
including the 1982 unofficial stock market crash in Kuwait; the seven-month
Gulf war of 1990-91; and the 1991 collapse of Bank of Credit &amp; Commerce
International. It was the last of these which finally spurred Gulf Arab
central banks to implement the Basel committee's guidelines.
Central banks' auditors' priorities still focus on the need for quarterly
reporting and inspection of banks' financial statements, stronger central
banks' initiatives to persuade domestic banks to merge, more open disclosure
in bank reports; all standard issues which need to be respected before the
GCC banking system can mature. In the UAE, an extra element of control was
added last year with the imposition of apparently stringent but in some
cases still undefined lending limits, to a financial market which is the
most bouyant of the six GCC countries.
According to the UAE's central bank governor Mr Sultan Al-Suweidi, UAE
financial institutions increased their combined profits last year by 65 per
cent compared with 1992.
A central bank report on 27 November showed credits from the country's 47
banks had increased 13.1 per cent to Dh81.6bn (Dollars 22.4bn) to the end of
September this year, compared with the first nine months of 1993.
Dubai contains some of the most adventurous of the Gulf's financial
entrepreneurs; and the UAE as a whole, because of its federal structure, is
certainly the most difficult of the six GCC countries to regulate. So it is
not surprising that it is the UAE's central bank which has been the most
authoritarian. However, UAE and Gulf bankers insist that, instead of
concentrating solely on tighter control over banks in their own national
back-yards, what the central banks and other authorities should be concerned
about is the fragmentation of Gulf financial institutions within highly
protected country zones.
For example, in all of the GCC, only one local bank, Bank of Bahrain &amp;
Kuwait, has a franchise, excluding representative offices, in as many as
three of the six GCC states.
By contrast, British Bank of the Middle East, among foreign banks, has a
franchise in five of the six.
Restricted in the UAE to eight retail outlets and generally deprived of
large and cheap government deposits, foreign banks have to work a lot harder
for their profits.
Speakers at a recent financial forum in Dubai staged by Emirates Bank
International , constantly returned to this theme of national banks'
fragmentation and protection. They included the former Kuwait central bank
governor Mr Abdul-Wahab Al-Tammar; the UAE's assistant under-secretary for
revenue and budget, and chairman of Emirates Industrial Bank, Dr Khalfan Bin
Kharbash; Mr Henry Azzam, chief economist from Saudi Arabia's National
Commercial Bank; Citibank's UAE manager, Mr Ahmed Bin Brek; and the former
chairman of Arab Banking Corporation, Mr Abdullah Saudi.
These and other prominent Gulf bankers have focused on the need for greater
innovation in the financial services' sectors, with backing from 'the powers
that be,' to match up to competition from western international banks, whose
innovation skills and constant range of new products were leaving Gulf banks
further and further behind.
'Who manages the huge private sector institutional and individual
portfolios?' asked one speaker. The answer: international investment houses,
because domestic banks were not equipped to offer the same range of
products.
'Our market is liquidity-rich,' said another speaker, and this liquidity 'is
being parked abroad.'
Governments had to establish credibility by setting up transparently fair
'practices, procedures and policies' - so banking, business, and judicial
processes worked effectively and equally. Individual GCC country markets had
to be big enough for serious investments to be made. Either governments
provided these - and recent events had shown that governments no longer
wanted to continue to be the primary investor - or entrepreneurs took up the
slack.
For that, the authorities had to set the banking sectors free by privatising
their shares in commercial banks and allowing in foreign competiton; by
establishing country and regional stock-markets (in the UAE a purely
national stock-market has been in the 'study-stage' for almost 13 years); by
allowing banks to operate freely across GCC national boundaries; and
allowing them to adapt to compete with non-bank financial interests which
were entering the market to do many of the things, such as credit cards and
auto-leasing, that only banks used to do.
The private bond sector should also be encouraged to help cater for regional
funding requirements through the establishment of an Arab credit rating
agency. In this way, domestic Arab institutions would be encouraged to issue
their own bonds for marketing across GCC national boundaries.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Arab Banking (10): A rush back to Palestine -
Jordanian banks clamour to re-open branches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
For the Palestinians, one tangible sign of progress in the Middle East peace
process is the return of Arab banking to the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Before the historic peace agreement, signed in September 1993 between the
Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel, most Palestinians kept their
savings under the mattress and the only credit available came from the UN
Relief &amp; Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.
After the 1967 war, nearly all the Arab banks operating in the occupied
territories moved out. Likewise, during the heady days of the intifada, most
Israeli banks which ventured into Palestinian territory also closed down. As
a result, Arab banking activity was limited to the odd branch of the Bank of
Palestine in Gaza and Jordan's Cairo Amman Bank which opened in the West
Bank in 1987.
Since the peace agreement all this has changed. Jordanian banks are
clamouring to re-open branches in the West Bank and the Palestinian
authorities have big ideas such as printing their own money and setting up a
capital market for their nascent state.
Six Jordanian banks - Jordan National Bank, Arab Bank, Jordan Gulf Bank, ANZ
Grindlays, Arab Land Bank, and the British Bank of the Middle East - have so
far re-opened branches and more are planned for next year. Other Palestinian
institutions are also in the pipeline.
Under the present arrangements, Jordan's central bank is responsible for
banking regulations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. However, the Bank of
Israel and the Palestine National Authority are also involved in licensing
and monitoring of the financial institutions, and a Palestinian Monetary
Authority is planned for the new year.
This confusing web of regulators, along with the free existence of several
currencies, are among the prime concerns of bankers on the ground.
'It's a very difficult environment. Not only are their huge risks in
offering loans in different currencies, but the regulations are a big
headache,' explains one banker.
Operational difficulties aside, most bankers are salivating at the prospect
of an investment-led economic boom which has been forecast for the
territories if and when the Dollars 2.4bn worth of aid funding which has
been committed over five years materialises. Taken against the World Bank's
estimates of GDP for the West Bank and Gaza Strip of between Dollars
2.5-Dollars 2.75bn, it is obvious that the huge capital inflows involved
will be a great boost to the services sector.
Arguments are still raging, however, between donor countries, the World
Bank, and the Palestinians over who will handle the distribution of aid. The
two main Palestinian institutions involved are the Palestinian Economic
Council for Reconstruction and Development (Pecdar) and the finance
ministry, although individual donors have insisted on monitoring their
contributions closely.
Despite the problems and uncertainties surrounding the final outcome of a
Palestinian/Israeli settlement, bankers are convinced they will have a big
role to play - 'the secret is to get in early and develop at the pace of
things on the ground. Sure, it's frustrating, but in the end it should be
very lucrative,' explains a Jordanian banker who plans to open the first
Islamic bank in the Gaza Strip in the new year.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Arab Banking (8): Everything depends on the peace
process - Israel's prospects as a regional financial centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SILVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fund manager in Tel-Aviv can eat a civilised breakfast and still trade on
the Far Eastern stock exchanges. During the day he can buy and sell in all
the European markets. And before dinner he can tune into Wall Street.
If Middle East peace adds the necessary element of political tranquillity,
Israel is ready to exploit this geographical advantage to promote itself as
a regional financial centre.
Meir Het, a former chairman of the Tel-Aviv stock exchange and of Bank
Leumi, Israel's second biggest bank, told The Financial Times: 'We should
try to encourage quality financial services that can utilise the benefits of
a location where you can sleep soundly in the night and still be active in
all the major exchanges.'
If the tax incentives were right, Mr Het predicts that American and European
Jewish professionals would set up shop in Tel-Aviv and provide the essential
expertise. He suggests conditions similar to those operating in Dublin - low
taxation for companies that do the business, no taxation on funds.
Mr Het served on a government committee, which reported last February on the
dividends that Israeli banks and finance houses could hope to gain from
peace with their Arab neighbours. It came out emphatically against turning
Israel into a tax haven - 'it would attract the kind of money we're not
interested in attracting,' Mr Het insisted. 'We don't need laundered money
here. What we should get into are things like fund management and custodial
services.'
Israel could also become a regional centre for development banking. Ten
American and European investment bankers are already dipping their toes in
the water.
'Almost everyone who counts today has some kind of foothold in Israel,'
according to Dan Halperin, a financial consultant and former Israeli
Treasury official, who now represents Salomon Brothers of New York in Israel
 -'mostly, they are employing Israelis as their eyes and ears.'
Originally, these banks were attracted by Israel's privatisation programme.
They are also angling for a share in large infrastructure projects, such as
the expansion and modernisation of the national rail network, plans for a
rapid-transit system in Tel-Aviv, and expansion of Ben-Gurion international
airport.
'By and large,' Mr Halperin admits, 'the investment bankers are here for the
Israeli work. But some are also coming in order to be involved in regional
projects, in which Israel will be involved. Let's say, a natural gas
pipeline from the Gulf to Israel, or all kinds of projects for the Jordan
Valley and the Dead Sea that were mooted at the Casablanca Middle East
economic conference in November.
'Nothing is very 'concrete' yet, but the bankers are looking.'
Meir Het is equally cautious - 'everything depends on the peace process,' he
says. 'If it goes well, the prospects are good. Interest is being expressed,
but bankers are conservative people. They will need to see that conditions
are stable. It's a future hope, but not something you can build on.'
Pinhas Landau, a senior financial columnist on Telegraph, an Israeli
business daily paper, believes that Israeli banks could also turn into
primary players in regional project and trade finance - 'if only because the
Israeli economy will be dominant,' he argued, 'it is perfectly feasible that
Israeli banks will take a lead.'
They would, however, have to build up their expertise - and compete with the
international giants.
The Gulf Arabs seem already to have trampled down the political and
psychological barriers against doing business with the Jewish state - 'we've
got nothing against the people with the money,' Mr Landau explains, 'and
they've got nothing against us. More and more visibly, they're seeking
business here.'
What nobody takes seriously is the suggestion that Tel-Aviv might assume the
role of regional banking centre that Beirut played before the Lebanese civil
war broke out in 1975. The oil sheikhs no longer need it. They have made
alternative arrangements, and the banking world has changed.
The days when Beirut was the only Arab capital where the phones worked are
long over. With faxes and electronic mail, it is as easy and as quick to
send instructions to Europe as it is across town. Market information is 'on
line' in real time. If the princes and the playboys went to Beirut to escape
the puritanism of Saudi Arabia, they can now fly to London or Paris in five
or six hours. And even with peace, tranquillity will remain relative.
'If you're an Arab sheikh in Kuwait, waiting for the Iraqi tanks to roll
again,' says Pinhas Landau, 'you keep your money in classic safe havens -
Switzerland, or Luxembourg, or the Channel Islands, or in London or New
York. What they offer is a historic record of expertise and political
stability, safety, security, secrecy.
'Tel-Aviv is lacking most of the classic requirements of a banking centre.
Nothing on earth is going to make the Middle East in general and Israel in
particular a safe haven any time in the near future, even if we make peace
with everybody.'
Then there is the more specific issue of a body of expertise - 'it is
entirely lacking,' he says. 'It can begin and develop gradually. Tel-Aviv
has certain things to offer, Jewish financial know-how among them. But while
manufacturing centres like Hong Kong can be built overnight, financial
centres cannot.'

FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Arab Banking (9): Fresh opportunities abound -
Jordan's peace agreement poses a big challenge for banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's historic peace agreement between Jordan and Israel, signed on
October 26, poses a big challenge to the kingdom's banking and financial
sector. Fast-moving plans for regional co-operation and joint ventures,
along with increased competition for cross-border investment and trade
present huge opportunities for development.
Some Jordanian banks have already begun to respond to the new political
environment by opening branches in the rapidly expanding economies of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip; meanwhile, a number of Israeli bankers have begun
looking for custodians to carry out their business in Amman.
On both sides of the River Jordan many hope that peace will act as a
catalyst for faster economic reforms and liberalisation. A recent report by
the World Bank* urges the Jordanian government to push on quickly with its
economic reforms if it wants to capitalise on the benefits of peace. In the
banking and finance sector it says the authorities must loosen the
regulatory environment, while the kingdom's banks need to modernise their
operations and introduce new products and services if they are to catch up
with international banking standards.
'We've been running the banks in the form of crisis management for the past
few years with one eye on political uncertainty and the other on regional
instability,' explains Mr Tawfik Fakhouri, chairman of the Bank of Jordan
which was the first to re-open a branch in the West Bank this year. 'Now we
have a peace treaty, banks will be willing to expand and invest in the long
term stability of Jordan and Palestine,' he says.
Jordan's crisis management began in 1989 when the IMF was called in to deal
with an overwhelming burden of foreign debt. This resulted in a five-year
adjustment programme and strict foreign exchange controls. In the same year,
the central bank was forced to take over two troubled local institutions,
Petra Bank and Jordan Gulf Bank, for failing to comply with banking
regulations. The psychological impact of the Petra Bank scandal, in which
one of the kingdom's biggest and most innovative banks was unable to honour
its liabilities, is still felt by the 15 main commercial banks operating in
Jordan.
Although the regulatory environment has eased over the years, certain
stipulations remain such as credit/deposit ratio requirements, restrictions
on capital transfer, and a national currency which is fixed at a daily rate
against a basket of currencies by the central bank.
Mr Michel Martou, the deputy central bank governor, says that more
liberalisation is on the way with the central bank working towards full
currency convertibility and gradually moving away from direct controls to
open market operations - there has been a weekly auction of Certificates of
Deposit for nearly a year now.
He argues that Jordan's banks stand a good chance of benefitting from the
peace agreement, as long as they diversify their services in favour of
universal banking, and further strengthen their balance sheets.
Not that the banks have been complaining much about the central bank's
rules. The health of their balance sheets has improved dramatically under
the well-regulated regime of the past five years.
Total private sector deposits, excluding government and inter-bank deposits,
rose by 94 per cent from the end of 1989 to stand at JD4.6bn at September
1994, while overall assets were up by 91 per cent on 1989 at JD7.2bn.
The repatriation of savings from Palestinians returning from the Gulf in
1991, after Iraq invaded Kuwait, provided an exceptional boost to the
banking system with foreign currency deposits more than doubling in 1991. As
a result, the banks have been very liquid. In September, the average
liquidity ratio stood at 56 per cent.
On the lending side, credit lines remain very conservative. Although the
amount of lending has increased by 51 per cent since 1989, September's
credit to deposit ratio of 53 per cent is still well below the legal maximum
of 70 per cent. Most credit still goes to commerce, trade and the
construction sector.
Industrial investment this year was equivalent to only 6 per cent of total
deposits. Although some specialised institutions such as the Housing Bank
offer long term credit for mortgages, more than half of all Jordanian banks'
total credit lines are in the form of overdrafts. There is little in the way
of corporate finance and syndicated loans.
On the Amman Financial Market - one of the most well-regulated and active
stock markets in the Middle East - the banking and finance sector accounts
for 44 per cent of the Dollars 5bn total market capitalisation. Windfall
profits by banks over the past few years have greatly increased the value of
their shares. The share price index for the finance sector rose by 58 per
cent between the end of 1991 and September 1994, outperforming the general
index which was up 46 per cent over the same period. A recent report by
Baring Securities in London recommended the Arab Bank and the Housing Bank
as some of the best buys on the bourse - although it expressed reservations
over Arab Bank's lack of disclosure.
Although foreign investors have shown an interest in Amman's exchange, with
a number of leading merchant banks now offering Jordanian stocks to their
clients, they are concerned about restrictions imposed on foreign funds.
Foreign investors need permission from the prime minister to trade on the
exchange and strict limits are imposed on the amounts they can invest. Most
are waiting for the kingdom's long-delayed privatisation programme in the
hope of corporate finance deals and new investment opportunities.
A central obstacle to further reforms and liberalisation is the kingdom's
heavy burden of foreign debt which currently stands at around 125 per cent
of GDP (Dollars 6bn).
Although a number of creditor countries has promised to waive part of their
dues in reward for Jordan's peace agreement, servicing and repayment still
requires a net outflow of funds from the Treasury. Government officials
complain that until the debt burden is reduced, regulations have to remain.
'Jordan deserves a fair chance. If we don't get more debt reduction, then we
can't make the peace dividends possible,' argues Mr Martou at the central
bank.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Arab Banking (6): Prospering despite problems -
Trends in Kuwait and Bahrain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The legacy of regional instability continues to haunt some financial
institutions in Kuwait and Bahrain, but there are banks in both states which
continue to prosper.
Kuwaiti private sector indebtedness from the collapse more than 12 years ago
of the Souk Al-Manakh, the unofficial stock exchange, continues to cast a
pall over the banking system and the entire economy.
Two problems remain after the passage of the second and final deadline, last
October 31, for the registration and authentication of bad debts under the
government's Difficult Debts Settlement Programme (DDSP).
The good news is that 8,889 debtors out of the original 10,391, just over 85
per cent, have either fully settled or have registered for settlement under
the DDSP's discount options.
Together, they were responsible for 96.8 per cent or some Dollars 23.4bn, of
the total debt of around KD7bn (Dollars 24.2bn). It is reckoned that most of
the 1,502 debtors who failed to register by the end of October 'are either
bankrupt and therefore don't care,' in the words of one senior banking
official; or they have already left the country and do not intend to come
back. Collectively, they owe KD228m (Dollars 788.9m), and will, in due
course, be taken to court.
More serious is the prospect for those 5,500 people who have registered and
who chose the first option for settlement - to repay their discounted debts
by September 7 next year, the end of a two-year period since the DDSP law
became operative.
Even after taking into account the generous discounts, which vary from 54.36
per cent to 75 per cent, depending on the size of the debt, these people
still have to find a total of KD2.5bn (Dollars 8.6bn).
Many of these individuals would have to sell their Kuwait-based shares and
property in order to raise the money. Such a massive sale of private sector
assets could well tear the heart out of Kuwait's fragile economic recovery
of the last two years; and the government is now said to be thinking of
asking the national assembly to amend the law to give these debtors more
time.
Despite these problems, the two leading banks, National Bank of Kuwait (NBK)
and Gulf Bank, each increased their profits by 22 per cent last year and
maintained profit growth through the first half of this year.
NBK in particular, the winner this year of Euromoney's award for 'The
world's best smaller bank,' stands out for never losing sight of the three
ingredients essential for any bank: a solid capital base; a clear strategy
from its board; and quality management which is allowed the freedom to
manage without interference.
NBK's return on equity, 15.98 per cent, and its tier-one capital adequacy
ratio of 22.75 per cent, are higher than many larger banks from politically
more stable areas. It not only stayed clear of the Souk Al-Manakh casino; it
also anticipated the regional economic downturn after 1982 and built up its
assets and business overseas so that today these represent some 35 per cent
of the total, and contribute more than that to overall profits.
Kuwait is also the home to Gulf Investment Corporation (GIC), owned equally
by the six GCC governments - Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and
the UAE.
In its turn, GIC is the outright owner - since 1991 - of Bahrain-based Gulf
International Bank (GIB), whose part-Iraqi ownership prior to that was
dispensed with in the absence of Iraq after the Gulf war by the simple
expedient of writing down all existing shares to zero; followed by the GCC
governments re-capitalising the bank. GIC is an investment and merchant
bank; GIB a wholesale commercial bank. Both were set up for the primary
purpose of promoting economic growth in the GCC.
For different reasons both have been slow towards achieving this purpose. In
the case of GIC, its focus has been blunted by GCC governments which up to
now have had the revenue to finance their own economies' development. GIB,
in common with many other Bahrain offshore banking units (OBUs), incurred
losses in Saudi Arabia; as well as in Latin America and Iraq. For all these,
provisions, sometimes full provisions, had to be made.
In both cases last year's profits were largely dependent on interest and
gains on investment and trading securities. For the first six months of this
year, GIB reported a three per cent fall in profits, largely because of a
fall in 'other income,' trading and investment securities, from Dollars
32.5m in 1992 to Dollars 14.4m this year.
Two other institutions stand out among the 69 OBUs and exempt companies in
Bahrain. Both are the antithesis of GIC and GIB.
The first, Arab Banking Corporation (ABC), has developed in just 17 years to
become the biggest commercial bank in the Gulf and one of the largest bank
holding companies in the Arab world. By the end of last June the ABC group
had built up assets to just under Dollars 19bn.
ABC's strategy and growth was synonymous with the vision and energy of its
founder and chief executive, Mr Abdullah Saudi, a Libyan national, who felt
compelled to resign last May as a result of political pressure exercised
through the US Treasury's Office of Assets Control.
His replacement, Mr Ahmed Abdullatif, formerly deputy governor of the Saudi
Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) and now managing director of Jeddah-based
Riyad Bank, will mean a radically different style of leadership.
The second, Investcorp is a more recent creation even, than ABC, and no less
successful. It was founded in 1982 in Bahrain by Iraqi-born US citizen Mr
Nemir Kirdar with Dollars 50m capital paid in by a few wealthy Gulf
individuals. His aim was to marry the capital export potential of the Gulf
with investment opportunities in north America and Europe.
By the end of last October, Investcorp had arranged 52 corporate and real
estate investment transactions worth over Dollars 6.5bn.
The few shareholders have become more than 10,000; paid-in capital is now
Dollars 373m on total assets of Dollars 1.4bn.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Arab Banking (5): Profit squeeze tightens - Saudi
Arabia / Few bankers believe there is likely to be a repeat of the
disastrous loan defaults of the mid-1980s slump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the boom year of 1993, in which eleven of Saudi Arabia's commercial
banks posted record profits and boosted balance sheets, comes the 1994
squeeze. While the sector showed overall growth in profits of 25 per cent
last year, earnings were up just 3.5 per cent for the first half of this.
Prospects for 1995, say Riyadh bankers, look tight.
The prime reason is the sharp fall in government spending, ever the motor of
the Saudi economy, and itself the result of flat to soft oil prices, the
legacy of more than a decade of fiscal deficits and, of course, the big
one-off toll of the Gulf war. The government began 1994 by decreeing a
sweeping 19 per cent cut in spending, a target economists believe is close
to being met. Further cuts are expected in next year's budget. As a result,
banks are being caught in a tightening vice.
One side of the vice is the demands made by the Kingdom's growing private
sector, to which government payments for contracted work and supplies has
dried up in the past 18 months. Bank lending to the private sector continues
to rise - it was up 7.3 per cent in the first half of 1994 over the same
period last year - but bankers say much of this is bridging finance to tide
over unpaid government contractors. The other side is the continued appetite
of the government, which has relied heavily on the commercial banks for its
deficit financing. By mid-year, according to a study by Mr Henry Azzam,
chief economist at National Commercial Bank, Saudia Arabia's biggest, total
exposure to the government had reached 28.5 per cent of gross assets, a
total of SR299bn. Economists say the government's domestic borrowing, made
largely through the sale of treasury bills and government development bonds,
has soared from zero to Dollars 84bn since 1987.
As a result, most banks are now either up to, or even exceeding, the Saudi
Arabian Monetary Authority's statutory loans-to-deposits rato of 65 per
cent. But while the borrowing needs of both the government and the private
sector are unlikely to abate, banks are finding it increasingly difficult to
expand deposits. Money supply in the kingdom, for instance, slipped 4 per
cent June-on-June and has shrunk further since, banker say - this largely
attributed to government delays or non-payment of bills.
Few bankers, however, are unsettled by these trends. Mr Azzam, for instance,
argues that most Saudi banks remain highly liquid, still able to draw on
their deposits with banks abroad and other foreign assets, including
securities, which he puts at SR37.5bn and SR92.7bn respectively.
'Monetary authorities may find it advisable to reconsider the 65 per cent
limit they impose on customer deposits to allow banks to respond more
favourably to the credit requirement of the public and private sectors,' he
argued in a recent NCB economic bulletin.
The squeeze has also prompted some useful invention. Saudi British Bank, for
instance, in August marketed on behalf of the government a first ever
Dollars 280m issue of dollar denominated floating rate notes. Part of their
virtue is that the notes need not be booked as loans on bank balance sheets.
They are also a more appealing prospect to many banks than either
riyal-denomination T-Bills or Development bonds, both of which have become
less attractive as US interest rates have risen, and while there remain
sporadic speculative assaults on the Saudi riyal - which the Saudi
authorities remain adamant will not be devalued.
A second floating rate issue is likely soon, and some bankers in Riyadh
believe other innovations may follow - 'the traditional ways of handling the
financing of the economy have reached their limits,' says the managing
director of one leading Riyadh bank, who says he believes the Saudi capital
market may be on the cusp of a new flourishing period.
Neither do bankers appear too gloomy about the present squeeze on the
private non-oil sector, the continued growth of which has been providing
most banks with considerable opportunities. According to Mr Azzam's figures,
lending to private businesses was 70 per cent higher in the first half of
1994 than at the end of 1990.
Pressed though many businesses may be, few bankers believe there is likely
to be a repeat of the disastrous loan defaults of the mid-1980s slump - 'the
banks will ride this through,' says one bank economist. 'The banks are
better positioned than in the mid-'80s and the private sector is better off
generally and better run.'
There have also been some signs in the past two months that the government
has started paying some of its bigger overdue debts.
Most banks have, nevertheless, begun to add provisions. One of the kingdom's
biggest banks says there has been a 42 per cent rise in late loan repayment
in the past 10 months, but that the bank is not panicking yet. Many bankers
say they are becoming increasingly cautious about new private sector
lending, however.
But bankers say private businesses are considerably more tightly run today
than a decade ago, banks are more willing therefore to step in and offer
assistance and many private companies are themselves better placed since the
post Gulf war boom - 'knock on wood, I don't think we'll see the kind of
massive collapse we saw in the 1980s,' says one banker. 'It's a much more
realistic world.'

FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Arab Banking (3): Competition in trade finance
hots up - Arab banks outside the Arab world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROULA KHALAF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We have stopped being a bank of big loans and big transactions, today it's
back to basics' says Mr Bernard Jacquet, chairman of the management board of
Union des Banques Arabes et Francaises (UBAF), Paris.
His words aptly summarise the fate of Arab banks set up in the West in the
heyday of Arab Banking with the ambitious aim of recycling the mountains of
capital exported from the Gulf. After falling victim to the LDC debt crisis,
most of the banks either went bankrupt or were taken over by Western
counterparts.
The few lucky survivors - including remnants of the UBAF Group, Saudi
International Bank and United Bank of Kuwait - have largely scaled back
their ambitions and are now focused on carving out comfortable niches from
their western bases.
The former UBAF group, once a loose federation of banks in the West with
common Arab public sector bank shareholdings, has now divided into separate
banks in each of Paris, London and Rome. The Paris and London banks have
secured an important stake in the trade finance between Europe and the Arab
World.
UBAF Paris, the larger of the two with Dollars 5.2bn in assets, has had a
harder time shedding its LDC debt problems, given a relatively significant
exposure to Middle East countries, including Iraq. Unable to generate enough
earnings to cover provisions in recent years (the bank lost FF722m in 1993),
the bank turned to shareholders again this year. Mr Jacquet says the latest
capital injection of FF501m, which raised total coverage to a comfortable 66
per cent, will be the last.
The trade finance business, meanwhile, is becoming increasingly competitive,
and business from Gulf countries - a big market for the bank - is down this
year. This has forced UBAF to streamline operations - staff has been cut by
15 per cent in the last four years, says Mr Jacquet - 'we're doing our work
smoothly and calmly and trying to do what we know how to do: trade finance,'
he says.
Trade finance business at UBAF Bank Ltd in London (1993 assets: Dollars
1.1bn), 75 per cent owned by Arab shareholders and the rest by Midland Bank
PLC, is focused on North Africa, and while business with Tunisia and Morocco
is flourishing, Algeria continues to be a critical risk.
With LDC problems behind it, and 78 per cent coverage of problem country
risk, the bank was able to release Pounds 7.5m in provisions back into
income last year, which allowed it to register total after-tax profits of
Pounds 18.7m and pay dividends for the first time since 1986. The London
rating agency, IBCA, raised its individual rating of the bank this year.
UBAF London opened its first overseas office in Beirut, Lebanon this year,
but 'our raison d'etre remains trade finance and we have no plans for a
concerted break-out into anything else,' says Mr Mohamed Fezzani, general
manager and deputy chief executive. The Beirut operation is headed by
Meguerditch Bouldoukian, a former vice-governor of the Banque du Liban, the
central bank.
London-based Saudi International Bank (with Dollars 4.5m in assets in 1993),
50 per cent owned by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency and 20 per cent by
Morgan Guarantee Trust Company, has undergone a significant transformation
in the last decade, gradually moving out of commercial banking and into
investment banking.
SIB's shareholders have been more than supportive - they rid the bank of a
dogging LDC problem by buying the LDC portfolio in two tranches in 1987 and
1989. A gradual phasing out of lending activity has now led to non-interest
income accounting for nearly half of total revenues, and derived in large
part from dealing profits. Buoyant markets last year thus pushed pre-tax
profits up more than 80 per cent.
The bank's niche is among institutional Saudi clients - total funds under
management now hover around Dollars 4.5bn. SIB attempts to bring to the
table sophisticated deals domestic banks may be reluctant to embark on. A
typical example is the Dollars 196m fund set up earlier this year with the
US's Morgan Stanley offering collateralised loan obligations, with the
collateral made up of high yield bonds.
United Bank of Kuwait, based in London, is one of the few Arab banks outside
the Arab world not to have been lured by the appeal of LDC debt  - 'that's
where the herd were going and we never found the risk appealing,' says Mr
Christopher Keen, UBK's general manager. But the bank, which chose instead
to channel Arab funds into financial instruments on world markets, suffered
a blow in the 1987 stock market collapse. It has since shifted gears and
refocused its business on fee-income from money management.
The strategy seems to have paid off. Last year, UBK, which has Dollars 2.8bn
in assets, saw profits increase by almost 40 per cent to Dollars 10.2m and
its individual IBCA rating raised. Fee income now makes up about 40 per cent
of revenues.
UBK, whose largest shareholder is Kuwait's Public Institution for Social
Security, now manages Dollars 2.5bn in funds and tailored portfolios. It has
channeled investments into a Dollars 125m high yield securities fund and
launched a fund based on the index of developing country debt with the
capital guaranteed.
On the lending side, the bank has sought diversification and has built a
sizeable business in property and aircraft finance.
In November 1992, UBK provided Dollars 26m to the lessor of a Boeing 757
operated by British Airways, and in March this year, extended a further
Dollars 24m on a second BA aircraft. Its total aircraft portfolio now stands
at Dollars 120m.
The bank is highly exposed to the property sector, which constitutes a good
chunk of its loan portfolio, though according to IBCA, the vast majority of
the loans are on completed and fully let buildings.
But UBK still harbours ambitions to play a larger role on international
markets. It is now attempting to take a giant leap forward by selling its
money management skills to US pension funds.
Last year, the bank set up Portman Asset Management, a new subsidiary that
will attempt to attract US pension fund investments into international
global government bond markets, where the largest component of UBK's funds
under management are invested.
'We think fund management is an area we can compete in with anybody,' says
Mr Keen. 'It would be a pity if we didn't extend our horizons further from
Gulf markets.'

FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Arab Banking (4): An inherent contradiction -
Acceptance of Islamic banking is growing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROULA KHALAF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After years of struggle to define itself, Islamic banking - which follows
the Koran's prohibition against receiving or paying interest - is gaining
greater acceptance in both the Arab banking world and the global financial
markets.
Bolstered by a growing wave of Islamic consciousness amongst depositors on
one part and the realisation among western banks that they might as well
take advantage of the increasingly esoteric way some people are choosing to
bank, Islamic banking is attracting newcomers and is now seen as the
fastest-growing segment of Arab banking. The US's Citibank has jumped on the
bandwagon and is set to open a full-fledged Islamic banking subsidiary in
Bahrain next year.
The growth of Islamic banking is a cause of concern as much as celebration,
as intensifying competition will increasingly drive banks to take on added
risk in an industry that remains fragmented and largely outside the reach of
regulators.
Industry statistics are hard to come by, but estimates put total funds
invested in an Islamic way in the region of Dollars 50bn. Based on a study
of eleven Islamic banks in the Gulf, Egypt and Jordan, Mr Farah Fadil, an
economist formerly with the Central Bank of Kuwait, says Islamic demand
deposits account for nearly 17 per cent of total demand deposits, and almost
15 per cent of savings and investment deposits. He estimates these funds
grew at 8 per cent to 9 per cent annually in the last 10 years.
Saudi Arabia continues to resist granting Islamic banking licences, lest it
draws attention to the fact that all banks deal in interest. But Al Rajhi
Banking &amp; Investment Company, which has a banking licence on the condition
that it not officially call itself Islamic, remains the largest Islamic
deposit taker, with 1993 assets of Dollars 7.6bn.
Kuwait Finance House, meanwhile, is one of the largest commercial banks in
Kuwait, with a 15 per cent share of the deposit market and Dollars 3.8bn in
total assets. However, conventional Gulf banks like Saudi Arabia's National
Commercial Bank, which have opened 'Islamic windows' to cater to religious
clients, are now stepping up their Islamic banking activities.
Jeddah-based Al Baraka with an estimated Dollars 2bn in assets and
Geneva-based Dar Al Mal Al Islami, with Dollars 609m in assets, have tried
in vain to obtain licenses to take deposits in Saudi Arabia and now act more
as investment companies, catering mostly to large depositors. A newcomer to
the field is the International Investor, an Islamic merchant bank set up in
Kuwait in 1992 with institutional Saudi and Kuwaiti shareholdings.
The increased competition on the commercial and investment banking sides is
likely to put pressure on the industry to provide better yields to
depositors. According to Mr Fadil, Islamic banks, with very few exceptions,
provide returns below those offered by conventional counterparts.
The reason may lie in the fact that there is an inherent contradiction in
Islamic banking. The Koran prohibits interest because money should not be
created out of money. Rather, profits should be generated from taking risk
on productive investments and depositors should share in the bank's profits
as well as losses. But the banks know that when depositors, religious or
otherwise, place their money in a bank, they expect to come back and find
it.
Faced with this challenge, Islamic banks, to some Moslem scholars' chagrin,
have chosen to mirror conventional banking's fixed rate products that
provide a pre-determined rate of return in a short term. About 75 per cent
of Islamic banking funds are invested in short term commodity trades and
trade finance deals where, in return for a fee, a middleman - often a
Western bank, like Citibank - arranges for a trader to buy goods on Islamic
banks' behalf and resell them at a predetermined mark-up.
To minimize their credit risk further, Islamic banks often seek guarantees
from third parties.
The Western banks have always been happy to oblige. Islamic banks, at least
in the early days, paid so little to depositors that they were considered a
relatively cheap source of funding. Islamic banks are often willing to
receive sub-Libor rates to get their funds invested.
The concentration of Islamic money in short-term deals continues to generate
much debate in Islamic banking circles as to whether the industry is
following the spirit in addition to the letter of the Koran.
Many Islamic scholars insist that the aim of Islamic banking should be to
develop the economies of poor Moslem countries by providing finance to small
enterpreneurs ignored by conventional banks - 'the challenge of Islamic
banking is not to finance the same project on another legal basis,' says Mr
Volker Nienhaus, an Islamic banking expert at Germany's Bochum University.
The drop in interest rates in recent years, however, has eroded margins on
trade finance and though Islamic banks do not deal in interest, the mark-ups
they charge are for competitive reasons directly linked to the interest rate
market. This, coupled with the spread of Islamic boutiques, which widened
depositors' choices, has forced Islamic banks to focus on longer term deals
in an effort to improve yields.
Islamic scholars are pleased with the arrangement, which brings Islamic
banking closer to the spirit, if not only the letter, of the Koran. And so
are Western bankers, whose experience and international reach allow them to
bring long-term deals to the Islamic banks' table.
Leasing transactions are gaining popularity. For example, ANZ Grindlays last
year arranged for Al Rajhi to lend Dollars 92m in bridge finance to
Pakistan's Dollars 1.9 bn Hub Power project. The International Investor,
meanwhile, raised Dollars 450m in Islamic money in 1993 to finance leases
for seven Kuwait Airways aircraft.
United Bank of Kuwait recently set up an Islamic equipment leasing fund,
marketed to Islamic and non Islamic clients, and promising a 9 per cent
return.
Mr Duncan Smith, UBK's head of Islamic investment banking unit, says the
shares in the fund can be traded and UBK has agreed to buy the shares back
from investors wishing to sell.
But there is much work ahead for the industry. A main challenge is to expand
the menu of products it offers. Some Western financial institutions, for
instance, are peddling derivatives tailored to the Islamic market. But can
Islamic banks invest in derivatives? It depends on the bank's sharia board,
whose members are experts on the Koran but less so in the field of bank
options, considering them 'unislamic,' but Dar Al Maal's sharia board, for
example, has approved the use of currency options.
What about equities?
It used to be the case that all Islamic banks resisted investing in equities
of listed securities on world markets because most companies have some form
of leverage. Now Dar Al Mal has convinced its sharia board that equities are
acceptable investments. The International Investor, meanwhile, says its
sharia board approves investments in companies that are no more than 30 per
cent leveraged.
'It's up to each institution to say what is Islamic,' says Mr Richard
Duncan, director of Islamic finance at ANZ International Merchant Banking.
The absence of a standard interpretation of the sharia, or Islamic law, will
dampen further development of the industry and slow efforts to establish
capital markets where standard products can be traded between various
Islamic banks.
Another growing concern is that the industry remains unregulated, lacking
not only a lender of last resort in case of failure - and there have been a
few in the 1980s - but also restricting banks from assuming risk and
managing their daily liquidity. The banks cannot keep reserves with the
Central Bank or borrow on the interbank market because they would have to
receive interest in return.
Mr Fadil says that Islamic banks have resorted to privately arranged
short-term liquidity techniques as a substitute, but he argues that these
instruments are often costly and thus negatively affect the banks' profit
maximization - 'this is an unregulated sector that controls a high
proportion of monetary aggregates in the economy, and this is a cause for
concern,' says Mr Fadil. 'What is needed is the beginning of a dialogue
between central banks and islamic banks.'

FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Arab Banking (2): Beirut, city of surprises -
Lebanon's prospects as a financial centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There used to be a joke in Lebanon that no wealthy family was complete
without its own bank. Not only was it the ultimate status symbol but it was
also useful in raising cash to help fund other family business interests.
For the seriously rich, this lure of personal banking was no joking matter
and, during the 1970s, the number of banks in Lebanon proliferated.
Despite 15 devastating years of civil war in which the political and
economic structures of the country came close to virtual collapse, the
majority of the banks have survived. There are currently 52 Lebanese banks,
14 subsidiaries, and 12 foreign banks operating through a network of over
590 branches - that is roughly one branch per 5,300 residents - making
Lebanon one of the most over-banked countries in the Arab world.
The bursting confidence and resilience of Lebanese bankers is a throwback to
the days before the war when Lebanon was an important international banking
and financial centre. The system of free exchange and strict secrecy
attracted money from a variety of sources; and a number of loans to India,
Renault and even the World Bank were arranged in Beirut before 1975.
Now that hostilities are over and a massive reconstruction programme is
under way, the government of prime minister Mr Rafik Hariri is lobbying hard
to persuade the world that the country can regain its position as a regional
centre for banking and finance.
To meet such aspirations the local banks are working hard to strengthen
their balance sheets, diversify their assets, upgrade their infrastructure,
and modernise their systems and products to catch up with rest of the
banking world.
'There will be major changes (in the banking sector) over the next few
years. The whole business is light years behind and it needs a lot of
investment in infrastructure, services and human resources,' argues Mr Derek
Kelly, a chief executive officer with the British Bank of the Middle East
who moved to Beirut this summer to shake up the bank's operations. At the
top of the list of changes deemed necessary by the central bank, Banque du
Liban, is a shake out of some of the smaller banks - more than 30 banks are
capitalised at less than a million dollars. By February of next year, all
banks must comply with the Basle Agreement and fulfil a capital adequacy
ratio of 8 per cent. This may set in train a series of mergers, though only
a small number of banks are expected to disappear.
For the larger banks, the pressing need is to iron out the distortions left
over from the war. Balance sheets have grown tremendously over the past few
years, albeit from a low base. Total assets increased by 326 per cent from
4.9 trillion (ie million million) Lebanese pounds in 1990 to LP20.9 trillion
by June 1994, with private sector deposits up from LP3.5 trillion to LP16
trillion over the same period as rich Lebanese expatriates returned flight
capital.
But lending to the private sector remains low and the principal currency
used by the banks, and indeed the economy as a whole, is still the US
dollar. Even though the pound has been stable at around 1,700 to the dollar
since February 1993 and the central bank has built up a hefty Dollars 3.8bn
in foreign reserves, the commercial banks do little more than buy
high-yielding Treasury Bills with the Lebanese pound. More than 60 per cent
of deposits and 88 per cent of lending are in dollars. The average credit to
deposits ratio for the sector is only 31 per cent and all loans are short
term for trade and commerce.
In an attempt to encourage the banks to extend more credit in local
currency, the central bank has relaxed its rules on compulsory Treasury Bill
subscription from 60 to 40 per cent of Lebanese pound deposits. More
importantly, interest rates this year have come down from 17 per cent to 14
per cent on 12 month maturities. Bankers believe that as the rate comes down
further, margin pressures will force them to find more borrowers in the
private sector.
Meanwhile, to cope with the demand for medium to long term financing, which
is essential if the country's reconstruction programme is going to be a
success, the Beirut Stock Exchange is being revived.
'We are conscious that the Lebanese economy cannot sustain real growth if we
do not have medium to long term credit. That's why the central bank is
backing all efforts to develop capital markets,' says Mr Riad Salameh, the
central bank governor.
Beirut's stock exchange was one of the most active in the region before it
was closed in 1983 at the height of hostilities.
The core of the new capital market is Solidere, the Dollars 1.8bn
property-development company which is rebuilding the centre of Beirut. The
success of the Dollars 650m Solidere issue earlier this year, which was 42
per cent over-subscribed, formed the basis of a secondary market launched in
late June.
Thirty-two banks and financial institutions have bought seats on the
market's fully computerised trading floor and foreign institutions such as
Paribas, Robert Flemming, Merrill Lynch and the Dutch-bank ING have recently
set up or revived offices in Beirut in anticipation of a fully-fledged stock
market in the new year.
'As a city famous for surprises, Beirut may once again have its day,' says
one banker, hopefully.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Arab Banking (1): Regional unity remains elusive -
Political suspicions have often been the chief impediment to economic and
financial integration in the Arab world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arab banking is not what it was five years ago. By and large, the region's
banks - and notably those in the Gulf - are more efficiently managed, more
soundly capitalised, better regulated, and generally more profitable. They
offer a wider range of services to increasingly sophisticated clients and
can draw on a fuller quiver of varied financial instruments, many of them
new to the Middle East. Capital markets in the region are starting to emerge
and showing tentative signs of coalescing.
Equally, however, Arab banking has not become the distinctive international
force many of the region's bankers believed it might - even as little as
five years ago. Regional integration of the industry, for instance, has
failed to live up to some of the more visionary dreams of the late 1980s,
particularly in the Gulf states - 'nothing materialised,' says a Riyadh
banker. 'There's no regional solidarity among the banks, there are no
institutions.'
More than a decade of discussion of cross-border co-operation among the six
Gulf Co-operation Council states (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, the
United Arab Emirates and Qatar) remains mostly talk - 'nobody's taking a
pan-Arab view,' says one Gulf banker. 'Saudi banks have plenty to do in
Saudi, for instance: they're not in the least interested in the outside
world. They're not even interested in Qatar next door.'
Internal rationalisation of the individual and intensively banked Gulf
markets, notably in Kuwait and the UAE, has also been slow to materialise,
with family-owned institutions stubbornly reluctant to heed central bank
urgings to merge.
Internationally-aspiring Arab banks, moreover, which once viewed themselves
as the prospective pillars of a new Arab banking order, have largely failed
to fulfil such ambitions. Banks such as Arab Banking Corporation, Gulf
International Bank and National Bank of Kuwait have survived the rigours of
the Gulf war and retained significant cross-border operations. But none of
the banks born during the petrodollar recycling boom of the early 1980s has
fully achieved its international ambitions. Most have retreated from
optimistic ventures in North America, Europe and the Far East for want of
profitable business.
'All the Gulf banks had problems,' comments Mr John Cunliffe, chief analyst
with Capital Intelligence, the Cyprus-based bank analysis and rating agency.
'They all had large deposit bases but, until recently, had no great
opportunities in their local markets, so they had to go overseas. But by and
large they were too small to get the best business.'
One result, concluded one senior banker at the recent North African and
Middle Eastern economic summit in Casablanca is that 'it's no longer
appropriate to speak of 'Arab banking' as such - what we have is banking,
done in Arab countries.'
Looked at market-by-market, it is perhaps most fruitful to divide Arab
banking into three centres of gravity; the Gulf, North Africa - specifically
Tunisia and Morocco - and those countries like Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon and
Syria whose chief economic determinant in the near term will be the
prospective fruits of peace with Israel.
The Gulf remains the Arab world's banking powerhouse, led by Saudi Arabia.
The 12 Saudi commercial banks account for 30 per cent of the gross tier one
capital of the Arab top 100, according to recent figures in The Banker
magazine, and the other five GCC states 40 per cent. But to give some idea
of the scale of Arab banking, a participant at a recent GCC banking
conference pointed out that there are 12 Japanese banks with greater assets
than all 160 Gulf banks combined.
Despite the overcrowding in some Gulf markets, most banks have begun to
offer an increasing range of retail services in countries where such things
as bank cards, telephone banking and consumer loans are relatively recent
developments. Given the large wealth and youth of most Gulf states'
populations, such services are offering banks some room for growth.
Corporate banking is also benefitting from the relative success in countries
such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain of long-standing government
support for non-oil based light industrial development.
Capital markets in Saudi, Bahrain and Oman are growing. And the persistent
needs of Gulf governments are adding to the still embryonic financial
markets. The recent Saudi offering of Dollars 280m of floating rate notes,
with a second offering expected soon, is one recent example.
In Morocco and Tunisia, meanwhile, the success of International Monetary
Fund-guided structural adjustments is leading to the steady modernisation
and internationalisation of the banking system. A number of western banks
has stakes in their Moroccan counterparts while two of the kingdom's largest
banks, Banque Populaire and Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur have
subsidiaries in Paris, Madrid and Belgium.
Investment funds jointly owned by Moroccan banks and companies such as ONA,
the kingdon's largest priovate company, and foreign interests are
increasingly active in purchasing shares in newly privatised companies.
Foreign investment in Morocco this year will be close to Dollars 1bn, nearly
twice last year's figure.
Thoughts of pan-Arabism have largely died for bankers in both countries.
Tunisia's experiment with a number of largely Gulf and Saudi government
backed banks proved a failure. These left a trail of poor investments and
bad debts which will take years to write off. They did nothing to generate a
competitive national banking industry.
Instead, the minds of private investors in Algiers, Tunis and Casablanca are
turned increasingly towards Europe, with a number of North African-European
banking alliances being formed. GP Bank, which is the merchant banking
subsidiary of Societe Marseillaise de Credit and a group of north African
investors who this autumn acquired 40 per cent of the capital, has spawned
two banks and one brokerage house in north africa.
Union Bank was recently set up in Algiers - the first of its kind in
Algieria. International Merchant Bank is the first north African merchant
bank and was set up in Tunis last October, with a capital of Dollars
3m-Dollars 5m. Its shareholders include north African individuals,
Creditanstalt Finanziera and the IFC. In Casablanca, Maroc Service
Intermediation (MSI) in which GP Bank and nine other Moroccan investors each
have a 10 per cent stake is one of the newest brokerage houses.
Similar trends are true of Egypt and Jordan, where economic reforms have in
the past few years led to reviews of banking regulations and practices. In
both countries, cautious privatisation and liberalisation policies are
stimulating fast capital market growth and rising foreign interest. And
though banks in Egypt, in particular, lag their Gulf counterparts in range,
efficiency and sophistication - only one Egyptian bank offers an automatic
telling (ATMs) - they are fast learning the virtues of capital market
services. Local banks have launched five new investment funds, the country's
first, this year alone.
But perhaps the most significant development in this part of the Arab world
will be the outcome of the peace process between Israel and its neighbours.
As the recent Casablanca economic summit signalled, there is a clear
determination among some regional states, most energetically pursued by
Israel, Jordan and Morocco, to create from peace the kind of economic
integration the region has so manifestly lacked. They will be building from
a low base. Recent studies suggest that intra-Arab trade, to give an
illustration, has actually declined over the past five years to around 7 per
cent of total trade flows from 10 per cent - one compelling reason why the
region's banking system has remained 'fractured and localised,' as one
Riyadh banker puts it.
For many at Casablanca, a first step was seen as the creation of a new
regional development bank. Its rationale was put by Mr Basel Jardaneh,
managing director of the Jordan Investment and Finance Bank: 'Since the
institutions of the region are not fulfilling their intermediation role to
attract international capital, and the fact that the banking system is
divided into small markets which has created rigidities and inhibited their
ability to intermediate effectively and at reasonable cost, the
establishment of a new regional bank should stimulate the integration of the
regional financial market,' he told one Casablanca seminar.
There were, however, as many doubters as advocates in Casablanca. Many
bankers wondered if the region needed a new institution, where there already
exist several Arab development banks. There was also as little agreement as
to exactly what the bank's precise role should be as there was a lack of
zeal among some western and Arab countries - notably Saudi Arabia - to fund
the institution.
The prospect of a peace-led economic integration has also raised the
question of where, and indeed whether, there might emerge a new banking and
financial hub for the region.
This question is central to the ambitions, specifically, of Lebanon. Mr
Rafik Hariri, Lebanon's prime minister, has put at the core of his
multi-billion-dollar plans to rebuild the country after its 17-year civil
war, the notion that Beirut will recover its lost 1970s role as the region's
chief financial intermediary.
There is little doubt that Mr Hariri has made significant strides in
recapturing regional and international financial confidence in Lebanon.
The recently heavily subscribed dollar bond issue and successful flotation
of Solidere, the company formed to rebuild battered Beirut, are two clear
examples. Hundreds of millions of dollars of private Gulf funds have flowed
back into the country. Institutions such as ING Bank, Robert Fleming and
Paribas have all established or expanded their presence in Beirut.
But there are as many bankers and businessmen who wonder whether the concept
of a banking centre makes any sense in these days of 24-hour global banking.
The waning importance of Bahrain, which during the mid-1980s turned itself
into the capital of the petrodollar recycling boom and replaced Beirut as
the Arab banking hub with the world, is often cited as a counter-example to
those who believe regional banking needs centres at all.
'Bahrain has become much, much more regional than it was a few years ago,'
says Mr Cunliffe.
'Things have changed considerably since Beirut's heydays,' says another
banking analyst. 'Nowadays, Saudis and other Arabs have discovered they can
do all the banking they want in Paris, New York, London. These places offer
more than Beirut did or Bahrain does.'
If any centre is to emerge, it may prove to be Israel, which in its drive to
integrate itself into the region politically, is carrying with it presently
the strongest force for regional economic integration. But, in a region
where political suspicion has often been a chief impediment to economic and
financial integration, Israel's energy may create as much competitive
jealousy as unity.
Mr Hariri, for example, believes strongly that Lebanon's ambitions pit the
country directly in competition with the Jewish state.
For the time being, however, there is no other centripetal force acting on
the Arab financial world. The Gulf states may make greater headway in
creating a cross-border banking and capital market. Oman and Bahrain, for
instance, are exploring cross-border share listings.
But the greater trend is likely to be increasing openess to the
international financial currents flowing into liberalising economies such as
Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia and Lebanon.
Whether such currents will leave remaining anything indissolubly 'Arab'
about the region's banking system, looks at this point unlikely.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australia resigned to shrunken
cotton crop - As the end of the planting season approaches drought losses
are already being counted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Estate agents' hype has acquired new twist in Moree, the New South Wales
country town that serves as one of the main regional centres for Australia's
cotton industry. 'Abundant underground water' shouts one shop-front notice,
advertising a ADollars 1.3m (Pounds 645,000) farm. 'This property has
received winter rains,' claims another, bearing a picture of lush, green
crops.
Australia's drought, which has devasted much of the rural sector on the
nation's eastern seaboard, is having a curiously progressive effect. First
to be hit were the grain growers, who failed to plant a significant winter
crop, in some cases for the fourth successive year. Next, the livestock
producers were confronted by feed shortages. Now it is the turn of
cotton-producers.
This sequential impact largely reflects different planting seasons.
Australian cotton is sown between October and December and harvested from
February to May. This a plus for the industry in international terms as it
allows growers to export when supplies from big northern hemisphere
producers, like the US, are at low ebb.
In theory, then, a tiny planting window remains in the 1994-95 season. But
with no sustained rain since March, and none forecast until perhaps the same
time next year, many growers have abandonned hope.
'This year's over for irrigated cotton,' says Alice Scott, who farms in the
Gwydir region around Moree, 'and there'd be quite a lot of rain needed
before you'd get much dryland cotton.' (In a normal year, about 90 per cent
of Australian cotton production comes from irrigated land).
This week, the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics, the
governments forecasting agency, said the area planted to cotton was likely
be 194,000 hectares, 71,000 less than was harvested in 1993-94. This, it
warned, could lead to the smallest cotton harvest since 1986-87. Abare
suggested that production could be 1.17m bales; the Australian Cotton
Foundation, representing the industry, has estimated 800,000-1m bales.
Even the higher figure would be about half the 2.1m bales produced in
1991-92, the record year. They would also represent the third year of
falling output as the intensifying water shortage in key growing areas has
sapped stored supplies.
Inevitably, given vagaries of rainfall and differing access to underground
water, the impact of the drought varies within the nation's cotton-growing
area, which runs from northern New South Wales into south-western
Queensland.
Areas to the north, like Emerald, and the Macquarie region to the south, may
fare relatively well. Unfortunately, despite some belated November rain
around the states' borders, it will be the central and most productive zone,
including the Gwydir Valley and the Macintrye, which is worst hit. Peter
Saunders, regional manager of Namoi Cotton Co-operative, the country's
biggest processor/marketer, estimates that the Gwydir region 'will be lucky
to do around 50,000 bales this year', compared with around 600,000 in
1991-92.
It is not just growers who are hurting. Decisions must soon be made about
processing facilities. Namoi says it may run only seven or eight of its 11
gins. Other processors confirm that similar cutbacks are likely. At the
broader social level, people are drifting away from the region, and towns
like Moree are beginning to see service businesses fold and shops fall
vacant.
To date, according to the ACF, no growers have actually gone bankrupt,
although Maree McCaskill, executive director, acknowledges that 'if there's
another year of this, people will start to go to the wall'. But already many
are living off the equity invested in their farms.
A further, less visable, problem may be the extent to which the industry has
sold forward. Unlike many sectors of Australian agriculture, cotton is an
integrated business, with a fairly short chain between growers and
end-buyers. There is, for example, no industry marketing board, and growers
choose for themselves whether they sell for cash, sell forward or sell into
pools.
At this stage, no one seems keen to predict the overall impact of forward
selling, or the number of contracts that will not be met. 'It will be a
problem but it's very hard to quantify,' says Peter Saunders. 'What you'll
see is what's happened in the past - growers approaching buyers and
negotiations for a roll-over,' says David Montgomery, managing director of
Dunavent Enterprises, part of the large Memphis-based cotton company.
Perhaps the most realistic hope at present is that the rains come as
predicted in March, and allow a non-cotton winter crop to go in. This, in
turn, could provide income to sustain growers into the 1994-95 season.
But even then, some observers worry that cotton's relatively high up-front
cost means that existing Australian growers will be hard-pressed to
capitalise even if the drought has broken by this stage next year. As Alice
Scott points out, it will be early-1996 before growers see any significant
cash flow. 'That's a long way off,' she says.
Perhaps the biggest question is what this severe hiatus will do to
Australia's reputation as a cotton-growing nation. The country is a
relatively new player; it only began to develop a substantial industry 30
years ago when strains of cotton more suited to the Australian climate were
discovered and irrigation infrastructure installed. Because of the
dependence on irrigation, the country boasts consistent, good quality
cotton, and most of its production goes for export. The Japanese, in
particular, have been substituting Australian supplies for Californian.
Most in the industry seem to be holding their breath and hoping that the
impetus - which has made cotton Australia's fifth largest rural export in
just three decades - will not be lost. 'It may take a year or two to get
back some customers,' says Mr Montgomery, 'but price tends to be the key. I
don't think it'll have a long-term impact'.
Even in the depths of this gloom, however, there are some encouraging
developments. Growers concede that the drought has prompted experimentation
with different growing strategies - varying the thickness of planting and so
on. Some also suggest that the water shortage will accelerate the drive to
develop new strains of cotton that can adapt to cooler conditions further
south, or the more tropical conditions to the north. The bigger the growing
region, runs the argument, the more opportunity growers have to diversify
their weather-related risk.
But others think Australia's politicians could do more to help. Mr
Montgomery suggests that more attention should be paid to the potential for
expanding production from the existing region, where climatic conditions are
ideal in non-drought years.
'The one thing stopping this industry from doubling in size is available
irrigated water,' he says. 'The problem is that most political parties are
not interested in building dams.'

Base metals prices at the London Metal Exchange had a generally steadier day
as investment fund buying was attracted by recent lower levels in some
metals. There was also some trade buying and bargain hunting.
Persistent fund buying of NICKEL saw the three months delivery price soar by
around Dollars 300 at one stage before it ended at Dollars 8,450, up Dollars
275.
Three months COPPER traded actively around the Dollars 2,900-a-tonne level
for most of the day until buyers gained the upper hand late in the day,
taking the price to a close of Dollars 2,912, up Dollars 6.
Renewed speculative buying and short-covering helped lift ALUMINIUM, which
was also affected by talk of power failures in the US north-west, where many
smelters are located.
TIN was subjected to further bouts of hedge selling and liquidation, but
this was well absorbed in the low Dollars 5,800s and a rally ensued.

havoc in Indian market

The absence of a scientific crop forecasting agency has once again caused
havoc in Indian textile mills. As earlier forecasts of a bumper cotton crop
of 13.8m to 14m bales (170kg each) have proved excessive there has been
runaway inflation in local cotton prices.
Not only have cotton prices risen by 60 to 90 per cent over the levels
ruling a year ago, say Industry officials, but farmers and ginners are
holding on to their stocks in anticipation of still higher prices.
The spot price of Punjab J-34 grade is over Rs1,900 a maund (82lb), compared
with Rs1,010 a year ago. Concerned about the suspected large-scale cornering
of the harvest from the 1994-95 season (September to August), the Indian
Cotton Mills Federation has urged the government to impose restrictions on
ginners' and traders' stocks. Such restrictions are already enforced on
textile mills.
'The market had seen so many distortions in the current season that all
transactions in cotton were suspended in Punjab, a big trading centre, for a
week,' an industry official said.
Most analysts have now lowered this season's estimate to about 13.1m bales.
Some believe, however, that it will not be much more than last year's 12.1m.
Industry officials say slow arrivals of new season supplies make it
difficult to make a confident prediction. 'Only in the new year will we get
a fair idea of the Indian cotton crop,' said one.
What is known, however, is that crops in the three northern states of
Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan have suffered a setback because of the second
severe boll worm attack in two years. And growers are worried that boll
worms and other pests have become immune to pesticide. The combined crop in
the three states may be only 3.8m bales, down from the original estimate of
4.4m.
Elsewhere, cyclonic storms have hit crops in the southern states of Andhra
Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and late rains cut output in Maharashtra
and Gujarat.
'Because of the high prices of the commodity last year, the farmers have
raised the land under cotton by nearly 9 per cent to 7.92m hectares,' said
an industry official. 'The crop will once again be small, but the unusually
high prices will sustain the growers' interest.'
The Eastern India Textile Mills Association has pointed out that many of its
members are 'holding cotton stocks of less than a week'. In these
circumstances the mills, as last year, will be importing cotton. During
1993-94, they imported around 300,000 bales duty free.
Even though the crop is going to be small, the government, in conformity
with the long-term export policy, has been considering allowing the export
of 500,000 bales. So far, however, export quotas have been granted for only
100,000 bales of the Bengal Deshi variety and 30,000 bales of soft cotton
waste. The government may go slow on exports if prices remain at the present
level.
'The issue is not only to satisfy the domestic requirement of nearly 13m
bales of cotton but also to have enough carry forward stocks for the next
season,' said an EITMA official. 'The Indian cotton season officially begins
in September. But the new crop starts coming into the market only in
November. Ideally, we should have an end-season surplus of 3m bales.'

Coffee prices tumbled for the second day in succession yesterday as roasting
companies backed away from the market and traders executed a flurry of
technically-driven selling orders. At the London Commodity Exchange, the
March futures contract closed Dollars 213 down at Dollars 2,455 a tonne, a
six-month low.
The New York market started the slide on Tuesday when futures prices lost 12
cents a pound. It failed to consolidate and recover the ground yesterday and
the market lost a further five cents to Dollars 1.48 by mid-morning.
'The market has shown no evidence we have reached a bottom yet - trading is
quite active and defensive,' said Mr Bill O'Neill, commodities analyst at
Merill Lynch in New York.
Market sentiment had weakened following a report by the US Department of
Agriculture last week, which showed that world coffee stocks were higher
than the market had thought. Prices were shaken yesterday by a report by
German statisticians estimating a rise in world output this season,
accompanied by a drop in consumption.
The FO Licht report estimated production at 92.3m bags in 1994-1995 compared
with this year's 91.1m. It put consumption at 93.4m bags in green beans
equivalent, compared with the 1993-94 level of 95.9m bags.
Mr O'Neill said the two reports had put traders on the defensive, but that a
lot of the selling was also driven by technical chart patterns. He said the
next support point on the New York market could be Dollars 1.35 to Dollars
1.40 a pound.
Guatemala will cut coffee export estimates for 1994-95 in response reports
from plantations on the southern coast that trees are producing lower yields
than expected, an official said, reports Reuters from Guatemala City.
'Farms on the coast are reporting a drop,' said Mr Max Quirin,
vice-president of Anacafe, the producers association. He blamed lack of rain
while the plants were flowering and said the drop in exports would be
between 2 and 5 per cent.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries mixed as data match forecast

US Treasury prices were mixed yesterday as recent trends reversed and the
short end of the market outperformed the long bond.
Late in the day the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  5/32 at 95
25/32 yielding 7.862 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note gained  3/16 at 99 3/8 , yielding 7.579 per cent.
Inflation has yet to appear in the prices of final goods, according to
consumer price index figures released by the Labour department. In November
the CPI grew 0.2 per cent, bringing yearly inflation to 2.7 per cent.
Although up from the 0.1 per cent figure for October, it was generally in
line with analysts' expectations. The increase was largely due to an uptick
in energy prices following two months of decline.
The figures led to a reversal of recent yield curve flattening as analysts
speculated that the low inflation figures might keep the Federal Reserve
from raising interest rates at the December 20 meeting of its open market
committee. The spread between the yields of the two-year note and the long
bond bounced back near 30 basis points after falling as low as 13 points on
Tuesday.
The spread has tightened sharply since mid-November, when the Fed increased
the interest rate 75 basis points. A flattening yield curve is viewed as an
indicator that market players expect an economic slowdown.
Despite the low inflation data, there were signs of strength further down
the economic chain. Data on industrial production showed a 0.5 per cent
increase for November with capacity utilisation at 84.7 per cent. Capacity
utilisation greater than 85 per cent is generally thought to be a signal of
future inflation, but the market had anticipated such a figure.
UK government bonds took a positive tone from a raft of UK economic data,
and outperformed German government bonds yesterday as the yield spread over
bunds tightened from 126 to about 118. Mr Kevin Gardiner at Morgan Stanley
said gilt performance was driven by short covering in the Treasury market,
and said the market might have underestimated the significance of employment
data. He said: 'The inflation and labour market data suggest that the phoney
war against inflation is over and the real battle is about to commence.'
The December long gilt future moved up  13/32 to about 101 15/16 in late
trading.
German government bonds lagged the rise in the US, with the spread under
Treasuries tightening from 48 basis points to 43 in slow trading. Ms Alison
Cottrell at Kidder Peabody said the eyes of investors would now be on the
Federal open markets committee meeting in the US on Tuesday. Ms Jane
Berryman at Technical Data said bund investors would be following closely
the coming wage round, which may be inflationary as trade unions might adopt
aggressive negotiating tactics to halt falling membership. The March bund
futures contract on Liffe rose by 0.05 on the day to 89.74.
Italian bonds rose yesterday, leaving the March bond futures contract on
Liffe around 98.69 in late trading, a rise of 0.03. Mr Corrado Costantino at
Williams de Broe said the bottom of the current political crisis had not yet
been reached. He said: 'We will have a lot of problems about who will form
the next government.'

FT  15 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Borrowings raised ante in
Orange County debacle - Derivative Instruments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Orange County, California, municipal investment fund facing more than
Dollars 2.5bn in losses after losing a highly leveraged bet on the direction
of US interest rates, did not need derivatives to snarl its portfolio. The
fact that the Orange County treasurer borrowed Dollars 12.5bn from
securities dealers to lift the ante on its bet ensured the fund would have
had devastating losses as interest rates rose, even if its purchases were
confined to conventional US Treasury notes.
However, it is interesting that Orange County and a host of other US
municipalities, money market funds and pension plans have found a way to
tuck some highly volatile interest-rate derivatives into their portfolios
while assuring their constituencies that they only invest in triple A rated
US government-backed debt.
This little deception has become far more transparent in the light of the
Orange County debacle, and is rapidly changing a long-held view that
government-backed debt is completely risk free. While the current debate
centres on debt issued by US government agencies, the discussion can easily
be extended to the international arena by examining the paper issued by the
international development agencies.
In the US, government agencies such as the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and
publicly-held corporations that package loans backed by US government
guarantees, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae)
and the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae) are massive
borrowers whose outstanding debt is second only to the US Treasury.
Their government guarantees assure these agencies very low borrowing costs,
but a number of them, seeking to lower costs further, have followed the
suggestions of the Wall Street dealers who act as their salesmen and issue
securities with imbedded features that make returns highly sensitive to
interest rate movements.
The derivative instruments, commonly known as 'structured notes,' offer the
same kinds of risks and rewards that are available by purchasing contracts
on listed futures and options exchanges. However, because they carry the
credit guarantee of the US government, and can be classified in investment
portfolios as generic 'government securities,' they are often purchased by
funds that would never be allowed to speculate in high-risk instruments such
as futures and options.
In the case of the Orange County fund, investment guidelines were so
conservative that even purchases of conventional shares were prohibited.
However, that did not stop Mr Robert Citron, Orange County treasurer, from
investing billions of dollars in agency structured notes. In several cases
it appears the fund bought entire agency issues valued at over Dollars 100m
each, tailored directly to Orange County's specifications.
Orange County officials said on Tuesday that approximately Dollars 8bn
remained in the municipal fund, but that about Dollars 2.5bn was still
pledged to dealers as collateral, reducing equity to about Dollars 5.4bn.
That compares with the Dollars 7.4bn initially put up by the town and
municipal agencies that are investors.
Of the securities remaining in the municipal fund, about 60 per cent are
structured notes consisting primarily of 'inverse floaters,' which have
coupons that fall as interest rates rise. With the Federal Reserve poised to
raise interest rates, these securities are barely marketable, although
Salomon Brothers has been retained to achieve an 'orderly' liquidation of
the portfolio.
The California municipal fund did not blindly stuff its portfolio with
inverse floaters. Mr Citron was a sophisticated investor who knew that these
volatile instruments could reap his county higher yields than conventional
investments. He, like many other money managers, successfully pursued risk
in exchange for higher returns for much of the past five years.
That the agencies have entered the business of issuing derivatives is only
mildly surprising. Mr Gene Eisman, a spokesperson for Fannie Mae, explains
it simply: 'We are a very large borrower of funds to serve the mortgage
markets in the US,' he says, 'Our main mission is to provide affordable
housing to low and middle-income families in the US. Structured notes are
just one more tool in the quiver of things we use to accomplish this.'
Fannie Mae says just 3 per cent of the Dollars 435bn in debt it issued last
year was structured notes. The Federal Home Loan Bank has about Dollars 55bn
in structured notes outstanding, or 31 per cent of its total debt.
To avoid another debacle, it has been suggested that the government should
stop endorsing, or guaranteeing, credit on derivative debt issued by the
agencies. This would take substantial courage on the part of legislators,
since the new budget-conscious Congress will need every trick to reduce
borrowing costs.

FT  15 DEC 94 / International Bonds: McDonald's targets short-dated
eurodollars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McDonald's, the US fast-food group, became the latest high-profile US
corporate borrower to target the short-dated area of the eurodollar market
yesterday.
Elsewhere, Pakistan made a successful debut in the eurobond market,
Argentina launched its first offering in the French franc sector and Jordan
announced that it had awarded the mandate for a Dollars 50m eurobond,
marking its return to world capital markets.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development announced that it
intended to borrow up to a net Ecu900m next year in medium to long-term
debt. This follows a net Ecu910m borrowed this year, at an average
after-swap funding cost of 38 basis points below Libor.
McDonald's launched a Dollars 200m issue of two-year bonds, offering a
coupon of 8 per cent and priced to yield 18 basis points over US Treasury
bonds.
The bonds were sold to retail investors in Switzerland and the Benelux
countries, lead manager Morgan Stanley said.
This continues the trend of recent weeks which has seen US companies such as
Walt Disney, PepsiCo and Heinz taking advantage of the strong demand from
continental European retail investors for short-dated dollar offerings.
Dealers estimate that funding costs in the two-year eurodollar sector are
currently around 15 basis points lower than in the US domestic bond market.
Pakistan made its eurobond market debut with the launch of a Dollars 150m
offering of five-year bonds, which is expected to be be priced today at
around 380 to 385 basis points over US Treasuries.
Dealers expressed disappointment that the offering was not Dollars 200m as
initially rumoured. However, lead manager Bear Stearns said the issue
established a liquid benchmark, which is held by institutional investors,
and which will trade well in the secondary market.
A syndicate official said that although Pakistan had no immediate plans to
tap the eurobond market again, the offering would pave the way for issuance
from the country's private sector.
Argentina made its debut in the French franc sector with the launch of a
FFr1bn offering of three-year bonds, which is expected to be priced today at
around 250 basis points over French government bonds.
ANZ and Paribas are rumoured to have won the mandate to lead manage Jordan's
return to world markets, with an issue of seven-year bonds by the
state-owned Telecommunications Corporation.

FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Life insurer looks to raise at
least ADollars 500m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Mutual, the second largest life insurer in Australia, said
yesterday that ADollars 500m (USDollars 387.5m) was the minimum 'meaningful'
amount of new capital which the group would be looking to raise either via a
public offering or the sale of a tranche of equity to a 'strategic'
investor.
Mr Geoff Tomlinson, managing director, said the mutual insurer was
entertaining both options and also considering a combination of the two.
However, the insurer was unclear about the timing of any capital raising,
suggesting only that it might occur in 1995 or 1996.
The comments came as National Mutual reported a sharp fall in pre-tax
earnings for the year to end-September, to ADollars 584m, compared with
ADollars 1.71bn previously. Premium income was higher at ADollars 2.7bn from
ADollars 2.56bn, but the total investment result fell to ADollars 851m from
ADollars 2.18bn, leaving total inflow at ADollars 3.55bn against ADollars
4.74bn.
The total investment result includes interest income, which was said to be
about ADollars 880m, and both realised and unrealised capital gains, which
showed an overall ADollars 30m loss.
National Mutual declined to specify the unrealised portion, but said
investment conditions had been difficult because of unfavourable bond market
conditions and a sluggish property market. The lower investment gains helped
reduce the tax charge to ADollars 30m from ADollars 279m. Earnings credited
to policyholders fell to ADollars 348m from ADollars 1.16bn. Group profit
after charges was ADollars 206m, compared with ADollars 227m.

<TEXT>
ABN Amro, the Netherlands' largest banking group, said it was issuing a
Kc1bn (Dollars 22.2m) bond, due December 15 1997, AP-DJ reports from
Amsterdam. The issue price of the bond, which carries an 11 per cent coupon,
has been set at 99.70, giving an effective yield of 11.123 per cent.
The Amsterdam-based group said it was issuing the bond on its own account
but that it would also likely place some of the proceeds of the bond with
corporate borrowers who are looking for Czech koruna.
The bank also said that early redemption of the bond was not possible and
that the issue was restricted to outside the US and the UK. In the
Netherlands, the bonds are not offered to private investors.
Payment of the bond is due on December 15, 1994. The bond might be listed on
a stock exchange in the future but ABN Amro said this had not yet been
decided.

Cedel, the international clearing and settlement company, will become a bank

Cedel also announced that it had been granted an A1+ credit rating - the

Cedel, whose shareholders comprise nearly 100 of the international banks, is
one of the world's biggest clearing, settlement and depository
organisations, with a 24 per cent share of the market for clearing
international traded securities.
Its move to achieve banking status was prompted by the Basle agreement on
international bank capital adequacy rules, which require deposits against
unsettled trades held at a corporation such as Cedel to carry a 100 per cent

<TEXT>
Japan's finance ministry yesterday issued a licence for a Tokyo branch of a
British securities subsidiary to operate in Japanese financial markets,
writes Gerard Baker in Tokyo.
Instinet Japan, which will begin trading early next year, is capitalised at
Pounds 5m (Dollars 7.8m) and currently employs 13 people. The company is
wholly-owned by the London-based broker Thamesway Investment Services, which
is in turn part of the Reuters group of financial companies.
Although the licence permits Instinet to trade both equities and fixed
interest securities, the company said it intended to concentrate on the
stock market, where its focus will be exclusively on institutional sales.
The Japanese equity market is currently suffering from acute lack of demand
and excess supply. Instinet plans to supplement its domestic Japanese
business by selling other Asian and European equities in Tokyo.
The company's arrival in Tokyo brings the total of foreign brokers operating
in Japan to 66 branches of 49 securities companies, the ministry said.

Enichem, the Italian state-controlled chemicals group, has taken a further
step towards the reduction of its looming debt by agreeing to sell its
majority stake in Alcantara, a microfibres manufacturer, to Toray, the
quoted Japanese chemicals and fibres company, writes Andrew Hill in Milan.
Enichem did not release financial details of the sale yesterday, but it is
understood that the disposal of the 51 per cent stake in Alcantara should
realise some L200bn (Dollars 122m).
Earlier this year, the partial flotation of EVC, Enichem's plastics joint
venture with ICI of the UK, helped reduce debt by some L500bn.
With the help of a L3,000bn capital injection from ENI, its state-owned
parent company, Enichem hopes to halve debt by the end of the year to
L4,500bn from L9,000bn a year earlier.

joint petroleum venture
</HEADLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Caltex Australia and Ampol, which is part of the Pioneer International
building materials group, agreed yesterday to pool their respective
petroleum refining and marketing operations into a new company to be owned
equally.
If the merger wins necessary regulatory approval, the joint venture company
will be the leader of the country's petroleum refining-marketing sector,
with estimated assets of ADollars 3.1bn (USDollars 2.4bn), total annual
sales of almost ADollars 6bn, and 28 per cent market share.
At present, Ampol and Caltex Australia - which is 75 per cent owned by the
US-based Caltex group, whose owners are Chevron and Texaco - are the two
smallest companies in the five-player industry. The current market leader is
Shell Australia, with Mobil and BP being the other competitors.
Caltex and Ampol said they saw big cost-savings from the deal, allowing them
better to compete in Australia's downstream oil industry where returns have
been extremely low recently.
They calculated that there could be a ADollars 500m addition to shareholder
value 'in the long-term' - although they acknowledged that this figure
incorporated asset sale proceeds as well as bottom-line cost savings.
They said about a quarter of the combined operations' workforce, or about
700 jobs, would be shed. It will have two refineries at Kurnell, in New
South Wales, and Lytton, in Queensland.
Under the deal, there will be a ADollars 150m 'value adjustment' in favour
of Pioneer - which Mr John Schubert, managing director, described as
'essentially a cash payment' - to reflect the difference in earnings of the
two businesses. Pioneer expects to book an abnormal profit of ADollars 200m
in its 1994/95 accounts as a result of the deal.
Inter-company loans to the merged group's operations will be refinanced
externally, a move which Mr Schubert said could cut Pioneer's balance sheet
debt to ADollars 110m from about ADollars 850m.
A pro forma balance sheet for the merged business, as at end-June, shows net
debt standing at ADollars 1.24bn, and a net debt to equity ratio of 109 per
cent.

<TEXT>
ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the world's largest power engineering combine,
yesterday confirmed that it is buying control of a lossmaking Indian
boilermaker for Rs520m (Dollars 16.6m) in a move which will greatly increase
its capacity to meet demand for building power plants, writes Stafan Wagstyl
in New Delhi.
ABB is taking a 76 per cent stake in ACC-Babcock (ABL), a former private
company which came under government control after it accumulated losses and
sought legal protection from bankruptcy.
The remaining 24 per cent of the equity will stay in the hands of the
government and of minority shareholders.
The government's Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction, the body
which nurses ailing companies, has approved the deal.
While the purchase price is modest, reflecting ABL's poor recent financial
record, the investment marks an increase in ABB's commitment to India
because the European company will take on ABL's 5,200 staff, doubling its
total payroll in the country to 10,000.
Also, ABB plans to modernise ABL's equipment and introduce new technology.
ABB said the acquisition would allow the group to serve the growing Indian
market for industrial and power station boilers.
ABL's products would complement ABB's existing output of turbines and
generators.

Cedel, the international clearing and settlement company, will become a bank

Cedel also announced that it had been granted an A1+ credit rating - the

By contrast settlement deposits at Euroclear, a rival settlement
organisation which has a banking licence through Morgan Guaranty, carry a 20

international securities clearing and settlement.

equity issue due to 'market conditions in both the Israeli and international
markets', writes Richard Lapper in London. The company, one of a number of
Israeli businesses seeking capital on international markets, had been
planning to raise up to Dollars 80m in an issue lead managed by Merrill
Lynch.
The price of the company's shares, which trade only in New York, is
currently at Dollars 18.50, having fallen Dollars 3.50 since the issue was
announced earlier this year.
Tadiran also said a special interim dividend, which depended on the global
offering being done, will not be paid. 'Plans for a future offering will be
announced as events warrant,' the company said. It also said it would report
by January 3 whether its shares would be listed in Tel Aviv.

<TEXT>
NEC, Japan's dominant personal computer supplier, and Fujitsu, its largest
computer manufacturer, have agreed to replace faulty Intel Pentium
microprocessors free of charge, writes Alan Cane in London. Some 150,000
Pentium-based machines have been sold in Japan to date.
Their decision comes as Intel, the world's largest semiconductor
manufacturer, and International Business Machines (IBM), argue over who
should bear the cost of replacing the faulty part which can cause
mathematical errors in certain conditions. NEC said it believed it had a
social responsibility to replace the flawed microprocessor.
IBM has already stopped shipping Pentium-based computers and has said it
will replace the faulty chip in the 100,000 Pentium machines it has shipped
so far. It will not, however, pay for labour costs involved.
NEC said its research showed the probability of the error in calculations
was very low.

FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: HK watchdog seeks liquidation of
MKI
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the colony's corporate
watchdog, has applied to the Hong Kong Supreme Court to have MKI
Corporation, an investment company, wound up.
The petition - the first of its kind by the SFC - follows an investigation
of the company's affairs under a section of the SFC's enabling legislation
where it suspects a company or its officers may be involved in fraudulent
activity, misfeasance or other misconduct.
MKI's shares were suspended in June after the SFC questioned it about its
recent share price performance and a number of statements it had made
concerning future prospects. These included a mobile telephone deal in China
and a plan to site a super-computer in Inner Mongolia to analyse seismic
data in Asia.
The decision came days after Mr Yao Mingwei was appointed chairman. Mr Yao
is the son of the late Mr Yao Yilin, a former Chinese vice-premier. He
replaced Mr Khundkar Khalid Ahmed Hossein who had himself only replaced Mr
David Tang, a company director, as chairman in September.
MKI's founder and main shareholder is Mr Arthur Lai, an entrepreneur, who
sold his stockbroking business to Standard Chartered in the wake of the 1987
stock market crash.
The SFC said that its application to have MKI wound up was based on its
belief 'that the affairs of MKI have been conducted in a manner unfairly
prejudicial to its shareholders'.
The High Court will hear the application on January 11.

<TEXT>
City Sprint, the US telecommunications group, is to form an alliance with
Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), the country's telephone monopoly, to provide
services throughout North America.
The deal cancels the previous accord between Sprint and Grupo Iusacell, a
leading Mexican cellular telecoms company, to provide long-distance
telephone services when Mexico's market is opened up to competition from
January 1997.
Sprint and Telmex did not release financial details of their deal, saying
the accord would not create a new entity. Instead, the two companies have
promised to exchange products and services, including software platforms and
other intellectual property.
Sprint said its alliance with Telmex would help it create a seamless North
American telecoms network. Sprint is already aligned with Call-Net, a
Canadian long-distance carrier, and operates four cross-border fibre optic
connections with Telmex between the US and Mexico.
Additionally, it is part-owned by France Telecom, which owns a 10 per cent
stake in Telmex.
Telmex said the alliance was an important step as it prepares to lose its
monopoly in the Mexican market, which is valued at about Dollars 7bn a year,
and which Sprint estimates could be worth Dollars 20bn annually by the turn
of the century.
Last month, when US telecoms group AT&amp;T struck a deal with Mexican
industrial conglomerate Grupo Alfa, Telmex was criticised for failing to
sign up with an important international long-distance carrier.
Iusacell, 42 per cent of which is owned by Bell Atlantic, blamed delays by
the Mexican government in publishing market regulations for the failure of
its own accord with Sprint.
It said it would continue with plans to enter the Mexican long-distance
market and to provide local services.

<TEXT>
Rhodia-Ster, a Brazilian joint venture controlled by the French chemicals
group Rhone-Poulenc, is set to raise between Dollars 135m and Dollars 159m
in a global initial public offering. It will be the first time in at least
15 years that a foreign company has floated part of a Brazilian subsidiary.
The company, which makes polyester-based products such as flexible packaging
and returnable bottles, is offering 117.7m voting shares - 23 per cent of
its capital - in three equal parts to the US, European and Brazilian
markets.
Mr Edson Vaz Musa, chairman of Rhone-Poulenc's Brazilian subsidiary Rhodia,
said the proceeds would largely be used to pay for Rhodia's capitalisation
of Rhodia-Ster, formed in May with Sinasa, a Brazilian chemicals group.
Sinasa's Celbras subsidiary ran up debts of around Dollars 200m to pay for
expansion of its polyester resins and returnable bottles production.
The pricing was being finalised in Paris yesterday by the company and global
co-ordinator, Paribas Capital Markets. The global depositary shares will be
listed on the US Portal system and the Luxembourg stock exchange. Shares
will also be listed in Brazil.

FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Tenneco plays key piece in
sell-off game - The group's last big unit sale leaves holes that must be
plugged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tenneco's decision to float its Albright &amp; Wilson chemicals subsidiary on
the London Stock Exchange early next year is probably one of the last big
pieces to be moved in the restructuring chess game.
The flotation will bring in some useful cash - it is expected to raise some
Pounds 600m (Dollars 937.3m) - but the loss of such a company, and others
during Tenneco's three-year restructuring, presents a a challenge: how will
Tenneco plug the resultant profits and sales gap?
However, the move to divest a significant UK-based subsidiary when the
company is pursuing a global expansion strategy shows Tenneco intends to be
highly selective about its international investments.
Mr Dana Mead, Tenneco chairman, is determined to focus the conglomerate on
just three main businesses - packaging, car parts and natural gas - and shed
extraneous companies seen as either too cyclical or lacking in the growth
potential he is aiming for.
Albright &amp; Wilson is a remnant of Tenneco's ambitious diversification
programme of the 1960s and early 1970s. During that period, the
Houston-based oil pipeline company transformed itself into a industrial
conglomerate, acquiring companies that did everything from underwriting life
insurance to manufacturing motor components.
Many of the businesses that Tenneco acquired were highly cyclical, and some
proved downright unprofitable, leaving the parent company struggling under
high debt loads and small returns for most of the 1980s.
When Albright &amp; Wilson joined the Tenneco stable in 1978, it was one of
several chemical companies in the group's portfolio. The others have since
been sold, but Albright &amp; Wilson remained, its marketability diminished in
part by a long-running recession in the chemicals industry.
The company is a world leader in the production of phosphate-based products
used in agriculture and for such diverse purposes as putting the bubbles in
shampoo and adding zip to carbonated drinks.
Mr Mead's decision to sell the UK subsidiary has a lot to do with the
cyclical nature of the chemicals industry - he must convince Wall Street
that Tenneco is becoming less vulnerable to economic cycles.
At the same time, Albright &amp; Wilson's profitability is benefiting from
worldwide recovery in chemicals prices this year, a factor that should help
to create an eager audience for its flotation.
Tenneco has worked hard to reduce Albright &amp; Wilson's operating costs and
help its Charleston, South Carolina, specialty chemicals unit recover from a
devastating plant explosion in 1991.
That year, Albright &amp; Wilson posted a Dollars 70m operating loss after
taking a Dollars 79m restructuring charge. For the first nine months of this
year, it recorded operating profits of Dollars 53m on revenue of Dollars
715m.
That compares with Tenneco's consolidated nine-month net income of Dollars
376m this year, on sales of Dollars 10.07bn.
Mr Robin Paul, Albright &amp; Wilson managing director, told a group of Tenneco
managers recently his company had the potential to achieve 20 per cent
annual profits growth based on expansion through joint ventures in Mexico,
Morocco, China, and the Pacific Rim.
Mr Mead, however, is betting that selling the company and reinvesting the
proceeds will bring in even higher returns for Tenneco.
Such a move, however, puts even more pressure on Mr Mead to replace lost
income from the Albright &amp; Wilson sale and the spin-off of 55 per cent of
Case Corporation, the farm and construction equipment supplier.
Those two disposals will net Tenneco more than Dollars 1.5bn in cash but
will cost it around Dollars 2.8bn in lost revenues and about Dollars 123m in
lost operating profits.
Mr Mead underscored his commitment to Tenneco's remaining 'core' businesses
this week by announcing he would use Dollars 500m of that money to
repurchase about 7.5 per cent of Tenneco's stock.
The share repurchase is a quick way to boost share value, but will not
satisfy Wall Street, which is reserving opinion on Tenneco's future until,
as one analyst puts it, 'we know what the company is going to look like'.
In the past two months Tenneco has announced a series of small acquisitions
and reinvestments in its core business, amounting to about Dollars 250m.
With the proceeds expected from the Albright &amp; Wilson flotation, Tenneco
would once again have ammunition for a large acquisition. However, Mr Mead
has discouraged those expectations, pointing out that a series of
smaller-scale purchases or investments focused on international growth is
more likely.

The global depositary shares will be listed on the US Portal system and the

The offering was due to be launched at least two months ago, but was delayed
after a judgment by the Brazilian monopolies commission, which insisted on
changes to the joint venture to prevent a monopoly in polyester and acrylic
fibres.
Rhodia-Ster then agreed to sell off part of its polyester and acrylic
business, but this will not significantly affect the company's growth
prospects.
The company, which has planned investments of Dollars 435m to the end of the
decade, says polyester demand is growing by 9.4 per cent a year in Latin
America.
Paribas Capital Markets said the issue had been oversubscribed in spite of
difficult market conditions.

<TEXT>
A controversial accounting proposal that would have required US companies to
deduct the cost of stock options from their profits was dropped yesterday.
Members of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets standards
for the profession, voted by five to two not to force companies to make the
charges against earnings.
The plan had come under fire in corporate and accounting circles.
Critics had complained of the difficulty of measuring the true cost of
options, as well as the effect the deductions would have had on the profits
of some companies, particularly small, fast-growing ones.
The FASB's vote follows an angry 18-month debate over the issue. The
regulators had contended that share options issued to a company's directors
and staff were similar to other forms of compensation benefit, and that
their costs should be deducted from a company's profits.
Yesterday, Mr Dennis Beresford, the board chairman, said: 'The board remains
convinced that employee options have value and are compensation. However, in
the final analysis, the board decided that there simply isn't enough support
for the basic notion of requiring expense recognition.'
Instead, the FASB said it would allow companies the choice of taking a
charge against profits, or simply disclosing in a note the effect on profits
that would have resulted from adopting the FASB guidelines for valuing
options.
The board said it 'expects to encourage, rather than require', companies to
use the first choice.
The board added that it had yet to decide whether to issue a new accounting
standard without further public comment, or whether to go through a new
consultative process. The decision is likely to be made in the second
quarter of next year.

<TEXT>
Sales of personal computers based on Intel's flawed Pentium microprocessor
chip continued to be robust, in spite of negative publicity and the decision
by IBM to halt sales, US retailers said.
Although customers are asking questions about the chip flaw, they continued
to purchase Pentium PCs in rising numbers, Intel said. 'We have talked to
the leading retailers and they are reporting no slowdown in sales.'
In spite of floods of calls to PC manufacturers and Intel's 'hot lines',
there have been no further reports of PC users being directly hit by the
flaw.
'We've sold more Pentium-based PCs than any company in the US market, and .
. . we had not received one call from a customer complaining of any errors
related to a flaw,' said Mr Ted Waitt, chairman and chief executive of
Gateway 2000, a leading mail order PC supplier.
'If this had been a problem with real world applications, we would have
heard from our customers.'
Several leading PC manufacturers said they would continue to sell Pentium
PCs, in spite of IBM's contention that the flaw can cause frequent errors in
mathematical calculations used in spreadsheet and similar applications.
Microsoft and Lotus Development, two of the leading suppliers of spreadsheet
programs, said they would provide customers with a software 'patch' that
avoids use of the flawed portion of the Pentium chips.
Microsoft said it believed customers could continue to use and purchase
Pentium-based PCs with confidence. 'Microsoft is continuing to purchase new
Pentium systems for its own use,' it said.
Other PC manufacturers expressing continued confidence in the Pentium chip
include Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Packard Bell, Tandy, Advanced Logic Research
and Acer.

Saga Petroleum, Norway's largest independent oil producer, will today sign a
seven-year Dollars 1.26bn revolving credit facility in London. It will cover
the group's borrowing requirements until 2000, and allow it to expand
through acquisitions in Norway and abroad.
The facility, initially for Dollars 850m, was over-subscribed by Dollars
410m and is priced at Libor plus 0.3 per cent. It replaces a Dollars 750m
loan which had a shorter duration and stiffer terms.
The loan's arrangers include ABN Amro Bank, Barclays Syndications and
Deutsche Bank London, with Norwegian co-arrangers Christiania Bank and Den
norske Bank.
Saga said the loan covers existing debt of NKr6bn (Dollars 873.5m).
The company is planning a listing on the New York Stock Exchange in the
spring of 1995, and plans to acquire reserves or companies both at home and
abroad.
Saga has operational responsibility for the North Sea Snorre field, which
produces 210,000 barrels a day. Also, in June, the group's North Sea Tordis
field was brought on stream and currently produces 72,000 barrels a day.

FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney cuts price of
tickets by 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney shares yesterday rose after it said that from April it would cut
by about 20 per cent the price of tickets into its loss-making theme park
outside Paris.
Mr Philippe Bourguignon, chairman, said the reduction was the culmination of
other cuts in operating costs and hotel rates over the past 18 months and
would 'get us out of the negative spiral in which high costs led to high
rates and lower attendance'.
News of the price cut pushed Euro Disney shares up 25 centimes to FFr9.60 in
Paris, although the company forecast said that, given its timing, the
pricing move would have little effect on results for the year ending
September 1995. It said its goal was still to break even in 1995-96.
Mr Xavier de Mezrac, financial director, said Euro Disney could expect a 1
per cent to 2 per cent increase in visitors for every 1 per cent cut in the
price of entry. But he gave no forecast of likely increase in attendance,
except to say he was confident the park would at least attract the extra
700,000 visitors needed to compensate for lower priced tickets.
The new price cut will bring the cost of an adult entry ticket down from
FFr225-FFr250 to FFr195 during the April to September peak season, and from
FFr175-FFr225 to FFr150 for October to March off-peak season, excluding
Christmas.
Turnover would fall by 3 per cent to 5 per cent if the price cut failed to
attract more customers because entry receipts formed only part of total
income, said Mr Mezrac. He described this as the worst case scenario.
Mr Bourguignon said the last quarter of this year had seen a rise in
attendance over the level in the same period of last year.
In the year to September 30, Euro Disney reduced its loss to FFr1.8bn
(Dollars 332m) from FFr5.3bn a year earlier, although attendance fell from
9.8m to 8.8m visitors over the same period.
Euro Disney said yesterday it had signed an agreement with a division of the
Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) French luxury goods group to develop
housing at the resort.
In addition, it was negotiating with a cinema operator to build a 12-screen
cinema complex in the park.

FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Fokker hit by warning on
reduction in deficit

Shares in Fokker, the Dutch aircraft maker controlled by Deutsche Aerospace
(Dasa) of Germany, tumbled more than 15 per cent yesterday after it said it
would make virtually no progress in cutting losses this year.
The profit forecast, which ran counter to a prediction in August that losses
would narrow in 1994, sent Fokker's shares tumbling to close at Fl 12.30
compared with Fl 14.50 on Tuesday.
Fokker blamed the revised outlook on the steep drop in the dollar in the
second half of 1994 and a further decline in the dollar-denominated selling
price of new aircraft. It expects its losses in 1994 to be about equal to
the record Fl 460m (Dollars 261m) net loss posted in 1993.
The company said it would continue to aim at returning to profitability in
1996, in line with its existing target. But to achieve this, it said it
would need to reduce its cost base further, holding out the possibility of
additional job losses.
A decision on what measures were needed to pare costs is expected to be
taken in the first quarter of 1995.
Dasa, which acquired a 51 per cent stake in Fokker in 1993, recently
injected Fl 600m into the Dutch company to shore up its balance sheet. The
Dutch government also lent indirect support by approving a Fl 400m sale and
lease-back of Fokker's technology to Rabobank, the Dutch co-operative bank.
Fokker, which has been majority-owned by Dasa since early 1993, has carried
out three rounds of restructuring in the past three years. These have
reduced the workforce to fewer than 10,000 people from more than 13,000 in
1990.
The company said the aviation market's malaise was more a problem of falling
prices than stagnant orders. Most of Fokker's costs are incurred in
guilders, one of the strongest European currencies, while its aircraft are
sold in dollars.

FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Banesto sells Asturiana de Zinc shares at
discount to market price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sale of shares in Asturiana de Zinc, the world's fourth-largest zinc
producer, by its parent, Banesto, the Spanish industrial holding group, is
to go ahead but at a discount to the market price.
Banesto yesterday priced the Asturiana shares at Pta1,515 each compared with
Tuesday's close of Pta1,550. The group previously indicated it hoped to sell
at Pta1,600 a share.
The sale will raise about Dollars 109m for Banesto and reduce its holding in
Asturiana from 62.39 per cent to 39 per cent.
Analysts said Banesto did well to get the Asturiana sale away, given present
weak market conditions which in the past two weeks have forced two other
mining companies - Samax and Union Miniere - to shelve share offers.
Banesto, whose parent Banco Espanol de Credito Banesto, was acquired for
Dollars 2bn earlier this year by Banco Santander, sold 23 per cent of
Asturiana in September, to a group of international investors for Dollars
82.6m or Pta1,500 a share.
Asturiana is the subject of a financial restructuring which includes the
placement of shares to Banesto to compensate for the cancellation of
Pta15.24bn (Dollars 115m) in loans that the zinc company has outstanding
from Banesto.
The latest offer is open to institutional investors and to Asturiana
shareholders who are entitled to one share for every 15 held.
Asturiana operates the world's largest zinc smelter in Spain, with an annual
capacity of 320,000 tonnes. This year it will produce about 250,000 tonnes
of zinc but management suggests this could rise to 300,000 tonnes in 1995.

FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Li Ka-shing strengthens hold on
container port
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong tycoon who made his money in the stock and
property markets of the colony, has made another timely investment. He
stands to make a quick profit of up to 60 per cent and put himself in the
position to strengthen his hold on Hong Kong's container port.
Mr Li has emerged as a leading shareholder in SHK Hong Kong Industries, a
listed investment company which yesterday said it would return HKDollars
970m (USDollars 125m) to shareholders by way of a special dividend of
HKDollars 0.60 a share. Mr Li, who began to acquire SHK's shares in earnest
a month ago, holds about 23 per cent of its equity.
Analysts estimate that most of his stake was acquired for far less than
HKDollars 1 a share, suggesting that he may have earned in the region of 60
per cent on his investment. Yesterday, SHK's share price was HKDollars 1.32.
Analysts said the SHK deal confirmed Mr Li's reputation in the Hong Kong
market as an investor with uncommon foresight. Others think his windfall
gain of 60 cents a share is the icing on the cake.
SHK's main asset is an 11 per cent interest in SeaLand Orient Terminals, the
smallest operator at Hong Kong's Kwai Chung container port - the largest in
the world. Mr Li is the dominant owner of the port through Hongkong
International Terminals (HIT), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hutchison
Whampoa. One of HIT's container terminals is next door to SeaLand's Terminal
3.
SeaLand also owns 50 per cent of Asia Terminals which operates what is said
to be the world's largest freight warehouse.
'I still think the end game is SeaLand,' said Mr Archie Hart at Crosby
Securities, a local brokerage. He believed that Mr Li may be prepared to bid
for that company once the surplus cash has been returned to shareholders.
Hong Kong's port is operating at full capacity, and Mr Hart believes that a
deal between HIT and SeaLand might increase the efficiency of HIT's already
formidably efficient operation. Alternatively, Mr Li might seek to acquire
SeaLand's terminal in exchange for HIT's right to own a piece of the
yet-to-be-built Terminal 9.
This is still the subject of UK-Chinese wrangling, mainly because of the
involvement of Hongkong Land, a Jardine group company, in the principal
consortium selected to operate Terminal 9.
Analysts believe that as Mr Li is a senior adviser to the Chinese government
he might be able to persuade it of the wisdom of such a solution.

Hungary's privatisation authorities yesterday backed down and agreed to sell
a 51 per cent stake in the country's last state-owned hotel chain to
American General Hospitality, a privately-held US hotel management group.
AGH won the right to negotiate for HungarHotels last month but talks broke
down between the company and the privatisation body, after a last-minute
price increase and political pressure to hand over the group to the
cash-strapped social security fund.

FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Wartsila links with Cummins
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Finland's Wartsila Diesel and Cummins Engine of the US, two of the world's
leading diesel engine manufacturers, are forming a joint venture to develop
and manufacture high-speed diesel and natural gas engines.
Wartsila Diesel, the largest unit in the Metra group, is the world's leading
producer of medium-speed diesel engines. These are more powerful than the
high-speed engines made by Cummins, the world's largest producer in this
field.
'Through this venture Cummins will be moving up in their power range while
we will be at the lower end of our power range,' said Mr Ole Johansson,
senior vice-president of Wartsila Diesel International.
Two new families of engines up to 3,600hp and 6,000hp respectively will be
produced by the joint venture. The idea is to combine Wartsila's design with
Cummins' distribution capability to lift volumes and reduce costs.
The initial collaboration will be based on the Wartsila 200 engine, a
newly-launched product primarily aimed at the marine and power generation
markets.
Production will begin at Wartsila's SACM Diesel Factory in Mulhouse, France.
The second engine family will be a new 4.5 litre per cylinder engine.
Production is due to start in 1996.

FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: GE Capital expands in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GE Capital, the financial services subsidiary of General Electric of the US,
has made its first entry into consumer finance in Germany by taking control
of Service Bank, the finance arm of the Kaufhof store group.
GE Capital is thought to have paid about DM75m (Dollars 47.8m) for an 80 per
cent stake in Service Bank. The move is a further sign of growing
competition to provide financial products such as credit and debit cards
from non-German companies.
It will use the bank's network of 36 branches in Kaufhof stores and 200
automated teller machines to sell a range of financial products. Outside the
US, GE Capital's strongest consumer operations are in the UK and
Scandinavia.
German consumers have not used credit cards, but the finance market has
started evolving as Citibank, the US bank, has launched several initiatives
including linking its Visa cards to the railway network Bahncard.
National Westminster Bank last year set up a German company to offer
domestic retailers finance for in-store cards. GE Capital said it intended
to use Service Bank to offer other financial services outside the Kaufhof
stores.
GE Capital is thought to have paid about twice book value for its 80 per
cent stake. The remaining 20 per cent will be split equally between Kaufhof
Holding, and the Metro and Kaufhof Group, the largest European retailing
group.
Mr Christopher Mackenzie, president of GE Capital Europe, said the purchase
was 'a slightly different way' of competing with banks. 'It is not just a
card issuer, but a bank that has got outlets in stores, which is wonderful.'
Mr Mackenzie said GE Capital, which provides finance in the UK for cards in
stores such as Harrods, Debenhams and Burtons, was 'looking at expanding
into credit cards' and its outlets would not be confined to Kaufhof stores.
As well as signalling competition in German finance, the purchase is
evidence of pressures facing European banks from other financial services
providers. GE Capital processes 80m retail card accounts around the world.
Service Bank, which has assets of DM760m, issues the Yesss debit card of the
Metro group. Metro has more than 2,000 stores in 11 countries, and serves an
estimated 20m shoppers a day.
GE Capital has some leasing operations in Germany, running the Avis fleet
leasing company, and the Tip trailer leasing group.

FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Accor ready for talks on unit
sale
</HEADLINE>

   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Accor, the French hotel and restaurant group, said yesterday it hoped to
negotiate this month the sale of a majority stake in its restaurant
concession business to Charterhouse, the UK investment fund.
The total value of Accor's catering business on French highways, airports,
train stations and museums is said to be about FFr1.6bn (Dollars 295.2m).
Charterhouse confirmed last night it hoped to take a stake of 'substantially
more than 50 per cent'.
According to French press reports, Accor is ready to sell up to 80 per cent
of its restaurant concession business for about FFr1.3bn-FFr1.5bn, as part
of the disinvestment programme the French hotel group has embarked on to
reduce its heavy debt.
Accor stressed it would remain 'the industrial operator' of the restaurant
concessions, a statement designed to reassure the public authorities
granting the concessions.
It would keep the same management team so that there would be no decline in
service with the financial entry of the UK investment fund into the
business, Accord said. Charterhouse is controlled by Credit Commercial de
France and its German partner bank, BHF.

FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Increased demand boosts Baggeridge to
Pounds 5.81m
</HEADLINE>

   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baggeridge Brick yesterday reported pre-tax profits nearly trebled from
Pounds 2.03m to Pounds 5.81m for the year to September 30.
The results were achieved against a background of a recovering housing
market along with an improvement in brick demand and a subsequent rise in
prices.
Baggeridge said increased demand had prompted the company to delay the
introduction of a new brick line to enable it to satisfy demand for its
existing products.
The recovery in the building materials business had also underpinned a rise
in capital expenditure, with new production capacity being installed.
Turnover increased 26 per cent to Pounds 37.7m (Pounds 29.9m) and earnings
per share trebled to 9.68p (3.33p). The final dividend is maintained at
2.375p for a same-again total of 3.125p.
The shares closed up 10p at 124p.
The company said the lack of a 'feelgood factor' in the housing market was
holding back sustained growth potential and adding to pressure on margins.
However, it remained confident of an 'overall improvement' in the brick
market in the coming year.

Shares in English China Clays, the minerals and chemicals group, rose 17p to
340p yesterday after it announced a modestly improved performance in the
third quarter in its main markets, especially the paper sector.
The Calgon offshoot in the US increased dollar sales revenue by 5 per cent
against the previous year, with the strongest growth in paper chemicals.
Sales of ECC's European sourced minerals rose 3 per cent, a lower rate of
increase than in the first half, and ECC's sales in the Americas and Pacific
region were flat.
An exceptional charge estimated at Pounds 5m will be made against 1994
operating profit for further rationalisation at Calgon. This also includes
the cost of integrating EZE Products, the US supplier of speciality
chemicals to the paper and surface-treatment industries, which it acquired
for Dollars 45.4m (Pounds 27.6m) in October.

FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Expansion for Fairey with Pounds 37m US buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fairey Group, the industrial electronics and specialist engineering concern,
is further expanding its electronics side with the acquisition of Randomat
of the US for Pounds 37m.
Mr John Poulter, chief executive, said that since 1991 the group had spent
Pounds 52.2m on six businesses in the field of on-line measuring and
electronic controls. Randomat's sole operating subsidiary is Microscan
Systems, based in Renton, Washington. It makes high-performance fixed-mount
bar code scanning and decoding devices.
Mr Poulter said Microscan would stand alone from the group - although there
were similarities between the company and other Fairey companies which would
give 'advantages rather than synergies'. There would be no rationalisation
and Microscan is expected to be earnings-enhancing in 1995.
Mr Poulter said Fairey would encourage Microscan to develop its markets,
particularly overseas. Currently between 75 and 80 per cent of its sales are
in the US.
An initial payment of about Pounds 31.5m, comprising Pounds 29.8m and
Dollars 2.7m (Pounds 1.64m) will be made at completion. Subsequently, loan
notes for Dollars 8.5m will be payable in 1995 and 1996 to Mr Mike Mertel,
Microscan's founder, president and minority vendor.
About Pounds 18.5m of the Pounds 31.5m will be raised from a placing of 5m
new ordinary shares at 374p. The balance will come from existing cash
resources and facilities, which will leave the group with cash in double
digits at the December year-end.
Mr Poulter said that while supermarket barcode scanners needed  1/4 to 1/2 a
second to 'read' information, Microscan's products could do 400 to 500 scans
a second.

FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Cost cutting behind Chubb's rise to 15%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chubb Security yesterday reported a 15 per cent increase in first half
profits as the electronic alarms and locks group reaped the benefits of its
cost reduction programme.
As part of the four-year programme, launched last year, the group has sold
lossmaking operations, endured large redundancies and unveiled new products
in a bid to improve margins and market share.
Mr David Peacock, chief executive, said those measures had begun to pay off
with pre-tax profits rising from Pounds 34.2m to Pounds 39.2m in the six
months to October 14.
Turnover showed a more modest rise to Pounds 371.8m (Pounds 355.2m),
including Pounds 2.55m (Pounds 3.88m) from discontinued activities, giving a
5 per cent increase in underlying sales.
However, Mr Peacock said the group had seen orders grow by 10 per cent from
Pounds 353m to Pounds 388m, with demand strengthening in several markets.
The rise was particularly marked in Asia and Australasia, where operating
profits rose sharply from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 14m, confirming its second
place to the UK, where profits were unchanged at Pounds 17.7m.
Physical security - locks and safes - saw profits rise to Pounds 19.4m
(Pounds 17.4m) while electronic security - alarms and fire detection - rose
to Pounds 19m (Pounds 18.1m).
Mr Peacock said the first half performance meant it was now halfway to
meeting its target of increasing its share in the Pounds 7.2bn world market
from 9.5 per cent to 11 per cent.
'We've done this after just 18 months of a our four-year programme.'
While aggressively pursuing increased market share, the group has also sold
its lossmaking alarms division in France and locks business in Australia,
and set aside Pounds 2.88m to cover first half redundancies and
reorganisation.
The cost of such measures, put at Pounds 4.5m a year during the cost
reduction programme, was offset by strong cash generation, which during the
period rose Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 42.5m.
Earnings per share rose to 8.2p (7.08p) and the interim dividend is raised
16 per cent to 2.32p (2p).
COMMENT
Solid rather than sparkling, these figures were nonetheless creditable for a
company which has yet to complete its 'pain first, gain later'
restructuring. Although sales were slightly below expectations, the growth
in orders suggests the strategy is working. The group has saved Pounds 23m
in the first phase of cost-cutting and its emphasis on new products and
emerging markets promises long-term rewards. With margins growing steadily,
full-year profits are likely to reach Pounds 88m, giving a p/e of 15.3. The
shares, down 5p at 293p, look fairly priced, given that they touched 424p
earlier this year.

FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Development costs push PhoneLink Pounds
1.96m into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PhoneLink, the Birkenhead-based electronic information services company
which was floated on the USM 18 months ago, yesterday reported a first-half
pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.96m reflecting the planned cost of bringing the
group's Tel-Me product to market.
At the same time the group announced that it had signed an agreement with WH
Smith Office Supplies to develop and provide an on-line office supplies
catalogue.
The system, which is due to be launched in early 1996, will enable business
customers to select and then order office supplies from a screen, and will
mark the first use of the Tel-Me system for direct electronic trading.
The group has also signed an agreement with Expotel, a UK hotel reservations
specialist, which will allow Tel-Me subscribers to make hotel reservations
'at favourable negotiated rates'.
PhoneLink's loss for the six months to September 30 compares with a Pounds
301,000 deficit in the comparable period and came on turnover up by 36 per
cent from Pounds 586,000 to Pounds 797,000.
Losses per share were 5.5p against 0.8p a year earlier. The shares closed 2p
lower at 218p.
The group's DataCare telephone directory service for database users
generated most of the first half turnover, although the Tel-Me service was
launched in May after three years' development with marketing beginning in
September.
Mr Trevor Burke, chief executive, predicted 'explosive growth' for Tel-Me,
which is based on a simple-to-use but highly sophisticated information
retrieval software package, and is aimed at the business market.
Tell-Me enables personal computer users to call up business information such
as company reports, telephone numbers, maps and news to their screen quickly
and cheaply.
PhoneLink has already signed agreements with a number of data providers
including BT, the Automobile Association and British Rail.
The group ended the period with net cash of Pounds 4.09m after capital
expenditure of Pounds 1.1m on completion of the infrastructure required for
the Tel-Me service.

Queens Moat Houses yesterday denied it had been granted soft banking terms
to enable it to continue trading.
The reply from Mr Andrew Coppel, chief executive, was in response to
comments by Sir Paul Nicholson, chairman of Vaux, who on Tuesday said:
'Certain companies, which ran into financial difficulties, have been kept
afloat with subsidies from their bankers enabling them to gain a competitive
advantage over properly financed companies.'
Mr Coppel said he 'totally disagreed' with the comments but refused to make
any further statement for fear of 'adding credibility to (the accusations)'.
Queens Moat is expected to announce terms of its financial restructuring
before the December 21 AGM .

Compco Holdings, the property company, achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds
366,585 in the half year to September 25, compared with losses of Pounds
198,149 last time after an exceptional Pounds 550,003 charge relating to one
of its joint venture properties.
Net rental income was little changed at Pounds 919,714 (Pounds 919,977).
Operating expenses, however, increased to Pounds 314,535 (Pounds 268,967)
mainly because of fees incurred in reorganising group borrowings and joint
ventures, the company said.
In December the property at Millharbour, London Docklands, was sold for
Pounds 1.43m, some Pounds 175,000 less than book value, which would be
reflected in the second half.
Earnings per share came through at 11.32p (9.58p losses).

FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Sunsail plans Pounds 20m flotation -
Placing with institutions intended to raise Pounds 3m of new money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL

<TEXT>
Sunsail International, the sailing holidays operator with more than 650
yachts worldwide, is planning to come to the market early in the new year.
The group, which aims to be valued on flotation at about Pounds 20m, intends
to make a placing with institutions to raise more than Pounds 3m of new
money.
Pre-tax profits in the year to October 1993 were Pounds 1.3m, on turnover of
Pounds 21m. Turnover to October 31 this year is expected to top Pounds 24m;
net debt stood at about Pounds 3.5m.
The business has grown from a sailing school near Portsmouth, which was
acquired in 1979 by managing director Mr Christopher Gordon, a sailing
enthusiast since childhood.
It now operates in 18 countries from 19 bases and nine hotel sailing clubs.
About 80,000 people sail with the company annually, with repeat bookings on
about 50 per cent of business.
In 1980, Mr Gordon made his first foray abroad through the purchase of
Island Sailing, with 40 boats in Greece, from Guinness with a three-year
interest free loan of Pounds 300,000.
The company expanded by acquisition, including one in Turkey. In 1987 it
more than doubled in size to an operator of 250 yachts by buying the Yacht
Cruising Association. A joint venture in the US took Sunsail into the
Caribbean.
In 1991 Mr Gordon sold the company for shares worth up to Pounds 8m in
Airbreak, the USM-quoted tour operator.
But Airbreak collapsed the following year, in part blaming unexpected
problems following the deal with Sunsail. Mr Gordon and his wife Sally,
marketing director, turned to Mercury Asset Management and put together a
Pounds 1.4m management buy-out to retrieve the company.
'We think we may be the only tour operator that actually survived a parent
company going bust,' said Mr Gordon.
Mercury remains the majority shareholder, with Mr Gordon, his wife and
management holding the rest. Mercury is expected to sell most of its stake;
management is planning to sell some shares, but to retain about 30 per cent.
Flotilla sailing accounts for only about 20 per cent of turnover. Sunsail's
activities include independent yacht chartering and shore-based watersports
holidays, as well as sailing tuition.

FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Purchases bolster Robert Wiseman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Acquisitions have driven both operating profits and turnover sharply up in
the first half at Robert Wiseman Dairies, the Scottish liquid milk processor
and distributor floated in March.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 1 improved to Pounds 2.95m,
against Pounds 2.82m last time when there was an exceptional gain of Pounds
327,000 on a disposal. Operating profits were up 21 per cent at Pounds 3.02m
(Pounds 2.49m) on sales 71 per cent ahead at Pounds 49.4m (Pounds 28.9m).
Wiseman has concentrated on supplying liquid milk in cartons and plastic
bottles to supermarkets and shops. Like-for-like sales were 15 per cent
ahead as the consumer trend away from doorstep deliveries continued.
Mr Alan Wiseman, chairman, said the group had been 'through the pain barrier
of losing doorstep business', which now accounts for just 10 per cent of
turnover, and was confident about progress in the current half.
Earlier this year the group acquired two Scottish dairy companies, paying
Pounds 3.2m for Mackies in April and Pounds 8.1m for Kennerty Farm Dairies
in May. Mackies contributed Pounds 4m to turnover in the period, while
Kennerty contributed Pounds 12m.
Net margins fell from 8 per cent to 6.1 per cent, reflecting the lower
margins at Kennerty. Since the acquisition, Wiseman has made Pounds 4m of
disposals with a possible Pounds 2m more expected from the sale of an
Edinburgh site.
Capital expenditure this year is expected to be Pounds 9m, including Pounds
5m towards a new dairy in Manchester, as the group moves into the English
market.
Mid-way gearing was 45 per cent, a level the group is comfortable with. It
had Pounds 7.5m net cash immediately after flotation.
The interim dividend of 0.9p is payable from earnings of 3.24p per share.
The shares closed unchanged at 100p.

FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help lift Chemring to Pounds
6.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Acquisitions helped Chemring, the maker of anti-missile decoys, marine
distress products and protective clothing, increase pre-tax profits by 14
per cent in the year to September 30.
The outcome of Pounds 6.49m (Pounds 5.71m), achieved on turnover up 35 per
cent at Pounds 53.1m (Pounds 39.4m), absorbed redundancy costs of Pounds
173,000 which had led to a 2.3 per cent fall in interim profits. Operating
profit on continuing business was up 8 per cent at Pounds 6.28m (Pounds
5.8m), on turnover 25 per cent higher at Pounds 49.3m.
Mr Philip Billington, chairman, said that all the group's businesses had
shown growth.
The group acquired Kembrey, a maker of electronic marine search products and
cable harnesses, in September for Pounds 4.8m, Hutchwilco, a New Zealand
supplier of buoyancy aids, in May for Pounds 1.5m and Nova Marine Systems, a
manufacturer of electronic marine search products, for Pounds 1.1m in April.
As a result, the proportion of turnover from the defence sector fell from 60
per cent to 41 per cent.
A 1-for-10 open offer in August raised Pounds 5.5m to pay off debt used for
the acquisitions.
Earnings per share increased to 21.3p (19.3p). The final dividend is 6.56p,
making 9.8p (9p) for the year.

FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring leaves Manweb lower -
Distributor has no plans to merge with other recs as speculation boosts
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Roberts, chief executive of Manweb, said yesterday the electricity
distributor had no plans to merge with other regional companies. 'Our aim is
to remain an independent business,' he said, announcing the first-half
results.
The Chester-based company reported a 40 per cent increase in the interim
dividend, in spite of a sharp decline in pre-tax profits and turnover.
In common with other companies in the sector it saw a strong rise in its
share price - up by 51p to 831p - although much of the increase was due to
speculation about bids and mergers.
Mr Roberts said Manweb was on track to cut jobs in the main distribution
business by 150 during the year. This would contribute to a 500 reduction in
the five years to 1997. Annual costs of Pounds 20m would be taken out by
then.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to September 30 fell by 58 per cent from
Pounds 54.9m to Pounds 23.2m on turnover lower at Pounds 394m, compared with
Pounds 437m.
The result was struck after exceptional costs including a Pounds 21.3m
restructuring provision.
Mr Roberts said Manweb planned, along with other recs, to demerge its full
holding in the National Grid, assuming flotation went ahead.
Earnings per share were 13.9p, compared with 34.1p, and the interim dividend
advances from 7p to 9.8p.
The dividend rise is the second highest in the sector so far. The company
said it was partly the result of rebalancing interim and final payments. The
underlying increase was about 15 per cent.
The company said profits before interest, restructuring and debt redemption
costs increased from Pounds 43.3m - also excluding one-off items - to Pounds
56.2m.
Manweb attributed the 10 per cent fall in turnover to a 13 per cent
reduction in supply business sales, where margins were tight. In the
distribution business, turnover rose 7 per cent to Pounds 126m.
The company is introducing price cuts of 2 per cent for domestic customers
from January 1.
It is also introducing a Pounds 6.8m energy efficiency scheme in Knowsley,
Merseyside, putting up half of the investment with the EU providing the
balance.
Mr Roberts said Manweb would pay up front for installation on customers'
premises for energy saving technology. 'By sharing the savings with the
customer we will receive a commercial return on our investment.'

FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Success of cider brands helps Bulmer to
Pounds 14m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cider brands of HP Bulmer Holdings enjoyed faster growth than the market as
whole, allowing the Hereford-based producer to report a sharp jump in
underlying interim profits.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 28 increased to Pounds 14.3m.
The year ago figure of Pounds 2.66m was depressed by a Pounds 9.33m charge
for disposing of a lossmaking business.
Underlying profits rose 19 per cent, while operating profits from continuing
operations grew 5 per cent to Pounds 15.5m.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 130m (Pounds 139.5m) but excluding disposals
there was a 7 per cent rise.
Capital investment, cost cutting, and brand developments would spur further
progress, Mr Esmond Bulmer, chairman, said.
Bulmer, the market leader, introduced three new products yesterday to
capitalise on the trend to premium ciders: Scrumpy Jack Old Hazy, a cask
conditioned cloudy cider, Strongbow Ice, the first ice cider, and Strongbow
Lemon White, a flavoured cider for Australia.
The interim dividend is raised to 4.25p (4p).
Earnings per share of 17.31p compared with losses of 1.42p including
exceptionals or earnings of 14.94p before.
Bulmer said the UK cider market grew by 8 per cent to 95.5m gallons in the
year to September. On-trade expanded by 5 per cent, while Bulmer's share
rose 8 per cent to 50.1 per cent. The off-trade increased by 12 per cent,
with Bulmer growing by more than 20 per cent in the premium and economy
sectors, but slipping in private label and edging ahead in mainstream
brands.
Mr John Rudgard, chief executive, said Bulmer hoped to complete soon
agreements with Heineken in the Netherlands and Interbrew in Belgium to
distribute its ciders to the on-trade in those countries.
Bulmer has a continental toe-hold through Stassen, Belgium's leading cider
maker, which it bought in 1992.
Further investment in Stassen should begin to show results this year,
although profits dipped in the first half, the company said.

FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Stoddard warns of flood damage costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stoddard Sekers, the carpet maker, yesterday issued a profits warning as a
result of flood damage at one of its plants caused by last weekend's
rainfall, the heaviest recorded this century in the west of Scotland.
The shares fell 4p to 28p.
The plant in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, was not insured against flood damage
after a professional risk assessment concluded in 1992 that such risk was
low. Defences at the plant had been improved after a severe flood in 1961.
Stoddard Sekers said its preliminary estimate was that the exceptional cost
relating to the uninsured element of stock and lost production was not
likely to exceed Pounds 1.5m. In 1993 it made pre-tax profits of Pounds
2.14m. Analysts had been expecting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 2.5m in
1994.
The BMK plant, which weaves material for Axminster carpets for the group's
contract carpet market, was flooded to a depth of 4ft on the night of
December 10 when the Annick Water overflowed its banks. The defences
installed after the 1961 flood were left 2ft below the high water level.
Stoddard Sekers said last month that the contract carpet order book was
healthy. Mr Ralph Ellis, chief executive, said yesterday that the
Kil-marnock plant would be fully operational by the end of February.

FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: London Electricity sees rising pay-outs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Electricity yesterday promised its shareholders steadily rising
dividends as it announced a 22 per cent increase in profits.
The company made Pounds 85.3m before tax and exceptional items in the six
months to September 30, against Pounds 69.9m. Exceptionals took in a Pounds
33m provision for restructuring over the next three years and Pounds 9.5m to
cover the premium incurred on the repurchase of government debt. Underlying
earnings per share improved 25 per cent to 30.1p (24p).
Sir Bob Reid, chairman, said the company was 'in good shape' with strong
improvements in trading volumes and continuing efficiency gains. The interim
dividend is raised 28 per cent to 9.5p; allowing for the buy-back of shares
earlier this year, this amounts to an underlying increase of 20 per cent.
Of the improvement in profits, Pounds 5.2m came from higher distribution
income and Pounds 5m from reductions in distribution operating costs. The
supply business transformed last year's loss of Pounds 600,000 into an
operating profit of Pounds 1m. Mr Roger Urwin, chief executive, said a
sizeable contribution had come from the networks at London's three airports
which the company bought for Pounds 90m.
Overall operating costs were down 6.8 per cent. The company shed nearly 400
jobs - about 8.6 of the total - and expects to lose another 300 in the
second half.
The total number of units distributed rose 2.6 per cent, with the biggest
rise - 3.6 per cent - coming from the commercial sector.
Mr Urwin said that dividend cover could be reduced and this, when combined
with potential earnings growth, gave scope for 'attractive real dividend
growth'.
Next April will see the start of the new price regulations which will
produce a cut of 5 per cent in real terms for customers, and cost the
company Pounds 39m in revenues over a year. Mr Urwin said that the company
disagreed with the way Offer, the regulator, had calculated the new price
formula. 'But it is a challenge and we have to meet it.'
Sir Bob said he remained confident about prospects. 'The key economic
indicators continue to look encouraging for London and we fully expect to be
one of the principal beneficiaries.'
The company would be looking for new opportunities to expand the business,
such as the airports deal. But it was also casting its eye abroad for
electricity distribution projects.

FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: VideoLogic to play with NEC - Shares rise
11 1/2 p on a deal expected to be worth millions of dollars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VideoLogic, the small multimedia company, has signed a development agreement
expected to be worth millions of dollars with NEC, the Japanese electronics
group, after a breakthrough which could revolutionise the computer games
business.
Neither VideoLogic nor NEC would comment on the value of the deal, but the
total will include an immediate payment and royalties on sales of the
system.
The news boosted VideoLogic's shares, which rose 11 1/2 p to 51p against 45p
at which it was demerged from Avesco, the broadcast equipment and services
company, earlier this year. At one point the shares fell to 22 1/2 p.
VideoLogic has already pioneered a number of advances in video technology
for personal computing which have attracted contracts from companies such as
International Business Machines and Compaq.
It has now developed a technique for creating three dimensional images which
are substantially more realistic than any so far developed, at about a tenth
of the price. Shadows, for instance, can be accurately depicted.
The radical cost reduction promises to bring games, at present limited to
arcade machines, into the home.
VideoLogic also published interim results yesterday, showing losses of
Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 2.5m) on revenues 23 per cent ahead at Pounds 5.5m.
Losses per share were 3.4p (2.9p).
The outcome confirmed the company's October warning of continued heavy
spending on research and development and falling personal computer prices.
Mr Derek McLaren, chairman, said the company had considered whether to go
for short-term profits or to continue investing in the research needed for
the multimedia breakthrough. If the company had opted for short-term
profits, he maintained that there would have been no possibility of the NEC
deal.
Existing products include semiconductor chips and printed circuit boards
which make it possible for PCs to handle video images and high fidelity
sound. It has designed multimedia chips for IBM and Compaq and has a
manufacturing agreement with Intel.
Under the latest deal, it will supply NEC's IT division exclusively with
multimedia products. It is developing the prototype of the games system
which should be ready for market by the end of 1995.

FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: ED&amp;F Man matches forecast with Pounds 31m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ED&amp;F Man, the agricultural products and financial services trading group
which came to the market in October, announced pre-tax profits ahead by 19
per cent from Pounds 26.3m to Pounds 31.2m in the half year to
end-September.
The rise, which was in line with indications given at the time of the
flotation, was attributed to strong performances by the agricultural
products and brokerage divisions. However, the fund management business was
adversely affected by volatility in financial markets.
The group declined to give a turnover figure. Mr Harvey McGrath, managing
director, said: 'Turnover is not a meaningful figure in our business because
of the variation in commodity prices.' He added that in commodity tonnage
terms, the half-year period was up by 18 per cent. He warned, however, that
this figure too could be unduly influenced by market conditions.
Earnings per share rose by 29 per cent to 8.9p (6.9p). The company is paying
a second interim dividend - set at 3.2p - at this stage, effectively as an
advance payment against the final dividend. In future, it intended to pay
the interim in February, followed by the final in September.
The shares slipped 1p to 170p, still below the flotation price of 180p.
Volumes in the agricultural products division rose by 18 per cent in the
first half, with profits almost doubled at Pounds 20.7m (Pounds 11.1m).
Particularly buoyant were profits from sugar, up from Pounds 4.4m to Pounds
9.9m, and cocoa, ahead at Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 1.9m).
Profits in the brokerage business rose by 23 per cent to Pounds 5.4m (Pounds
4.4m). But profits from fund management declined by 46 per cent to Pounds
6.2m (Pounds 11.5m). Mr McGrath cautioned that unfavourable market
conditions continued to undermine the division's performance.
However, he remained confident about the overall outlook for the group for
the rest of the year.

FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: MAM put in offer period
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Takeover Panel yesterday placed Mercury Asset Management, the fund
management company which is 75 per cent owned by SG Warburg, in an offer
period because of Warburg's intention to merge with Morgan Stanley.
The decision follows market speculation over whether Warburg and Morgan
Stanley will make an offer to acquire the 25 per cent minority stake in MAM
to merge it with Morgan Stanley's fund management arm. It means that
relevant share dealings by Warburg, Morgan Stanley and MAM, and connected
parties, have to be disclosed.
The panel could eventually force Warburg and Morgan Stanley to make a tender
offer for the MAM minority under the 'chain principle', if it decided that a
main purpose of the merger was to acquire the assets of MAM.

FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hornby warning hits share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Old fashioned children may be wishing for a train set for Christmas, but
their dreams are not being translated into cash for Hornby.
The USM-quoted toys group yesterday issued a warning that profits for the
current year would be 'substantially lower' than last year's Pounds 1.72m.
The shares fell by 50p to 127p.
'It is going to be a poor Christmas. The turnover will be good because
people have money, but the profits won't because people will be waiting for
the sale bargains,' said one source close to the company.
Hornby may be synonymous with the golden age of railways, but the company
concentrates most of its precision engineering on Scalextric. The miniature
racing car game is largely responsible for an expected rise in turnover
above last year's Pounds 28.2m.
The cost of expansion overseas, together with a heavy advertising campaign,
has hit margins. Combined with the pressure on high street sales, this has
prompted analysts to forecast an annual profit of about Pounds 700,000, less
than half last year's figure.

FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Radio rises to Pounds 4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Radio Holdings, formerly known as Radio Clyde, boosted annual
pre-tax profits by 39 per cent from Pounds 3.03m to Pounds 4.2m and lifted
its final dividend by 50 per cent, writes David Blackwell.
The USM-traded company will be seeking a full listing in the new year. It is
also proposing a 5-for-2 share split to improve the marketability of the
shares, which closed up 2p at 570p yesterday.
Mr Ian Chapman, chairman, said the group was 'delighted to be reporting our
best ever year.' During the first two months of the new financial year,
total broadcast revenue was 24 per cent ahead.
Turnover for the year to September increased by 17 per cent to Pounds 15.7m
(Pounds 13.4m). Earnings rose from 24.7p to 31.6p.
Radio Clyde, the flagship station, has a 44 per cent share of listeners in
its area, the highest level in the UK.
The final dividend of 9p, makes 13.5p (9.5p) for the year.

FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: MFI fails to dispel retail gloom with
Pounds 29m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MFI, the furniture retailer and manufacturer, failed to dispel the gloom in
the retail sector yesterday when it reported interim profits at the bottom
end of expectations thanks to a squeeze on gross margins.
Pre-tax profits for the 28 weeks to November 12 rose from Pounds 24.5m -
excluding a Pounds 19.6m exceptional gain on the sale of MFI's stake in
Carpetright - to Pounds 29m. With analysts forecasting up to Pounds 39m, the
shares fell 2 1/2 p to 122p.
The problem was not on the sales side - UK retail sales increased 12 per
cent, while group turnover increased 13 per cent to Pounds 363m (Pounds
320m). Mr Derek Hunt, chairman, said the trend had been maintained in the
second half.
'There is no doom and gloom here,' he added, referring to reports of
disappointing high street sales. 'Last year at this time we were 3 per cent
ahead.'
MFI revealed, however, that gross margins had fallen from 55.6 per cent to
52.9 per cent.
Ms Sue Murphy, finance director, said that resulted from a fall in the
proportion of MFI-manufactured goods sold from 55 to 52 per cent, and the
Pounds 3m cost of installing new ranges in stores. The group was also having
difficulty passing on to consumers price increases for raw materials such as
paper, chipboard, chemicals, and plastics.
With operating profits up 11.7 per cent from Pounds 27.4m to Pounds 30.6m,
the group operating margin fell 0.2 points to 8.4 per cent. The effects of
the gross margin fall was offset by lower costs, but analysts were
disappointed by a 5.8 per cent increase in payroll costs.
The interim dividend was lifted to 1.5p (1.33p), with earnings per share up
from 2.78p - before exceptionals - to 3.3p.
Seven new UK stores have opened this year.
COMMENT
If MFI is still a barometer of the retail trade - it started suffering from
recession a year before other retailers - the outlook for the sector remains
blustery: sales growing nicely, but gross margins squeezed by rising raw
materials costs. MFI hopes to pass on more costs to consumers in the second
half. However, without recovery in the housing market, consumer durables
will remain highly competitive, limiting scope for price increases. It must
then rely on customers buying more products from its own factories.
Consensus full-year forecasts were trimmed to Pounds 80m, putting the shares
on a prospective multiple of 12.5, which looks fair given the margin
uncertainty.

FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Crockfords expands with Pounds 18m casino
buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Crockfords, the casino company that was reversed into TV-am last year,
yesterday bought the International Sporting Club from Brent Walker for
Pounds 18m cash.
The International Sporting Club in Mayfair is pitched at the middle of the
market, and will be Crockfords' second premises. There are just 21 casinos
in London, and acquisition is the only practical way an operator can expand
in the business.
Crockfords opened London's first legal casino in Curzon Street in 1961. Last
August the company reversed into TV-am, which had lost its licence and was
planning a voluntary liquidation.
Mr Gary Nesbitt, chairman, bought Crockfords from Brent Walker in 1990, and
has turned it from a casino where players were betting Pounds 2 at a time to
the sort of establishment where players can lose Pounds 1m in a single
night.
He said earlier this year that his strategy would be to continue to develop
the existing club and to look out for acquisitions in London.
Brent Walker has owned the International Sporting Club since 1987. It has
been operating from its existing premises, which are undergoing
refurbishment, since 1990.
In 1993 the casino made an operating profit of Pounds 1.6m on turnover of
Pounds 9.8m.
Crockfords is meeting the consideration from existing resources. It is
acquiring a new 25-year lease on the premises.

FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Liquidation likely at Archer arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Archer, the Lloyd's agency, expects a liquidator to be appointed to 'a
number of subsidiaries' affected by litigation.
Mr Bryan Kellett, chairman, said the group was regarding as discontinued
four members' agencies and a managing agency hit by court victories by
lossmaking Lloyd's Names - individuals whose assets have traditionally
supported the insurance market.
The agencies were acquired by Archer in recent years but the group is taking
advice on their future.
Archer also announced it had spent Pounds 342,000 on professional fees while
reviewing its future in the light of changes at Lloyd's. A separate company
set up to invest in Archer syndicates has raised about Pounds 4m - lower
than the group had hoped for.
Mr Kellett said continuing businesses made an operating profit in the year.
However, the group anticipates a 12.5 per cent fall in the underwriting
capacity of on-going insurance syndicates under its management in 1995. The
number of syndicates run by Archer will fall from 15 to 12.
Archer also announced a reduced pre-tax deficit of Pounds 240,000 (Pounds
820,000) for the 12 months to September 30. Turnover rose to Pounds 10.7m
(Pounds 8.3m).
Losses per share were 0.9p (1.9p). A recommended final dividend of 0.5p
makes an unchanged total of 1p.
The group still hopes to acquire the members agency business of Cox Group.

FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Stirling ahead to Pounds 2.22m in depressed
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stirling Group, the clothing manufacturer, reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 2.22m for the six months to September 30, against Pounds 223,000
after losses of Pounds 926,000 from discontinued operations, writes Peter
Pearse.
The shares closed down 3p at 54p. Mr Steven Bentwood, chief executive, saw
the fall against a background of a depressed textile sector as well as a
depressed retail sector.
Continuing activities saw operating profits advance 15 per cent to Pounds
2.02m (Pounds 1.76m) on turnover up 6 per cent at Pounds 38m (Pounds 35.8m).
The profits pleased Mr Bentwood but he would have preferred the turnover to
have risen 8 per cent.
The group announced in April it was to withdraw from its import business. In
the half it accounted for turnover of Pounds 4.25m (Pounds 10.9m) and
operating losses of Pounds 418,000 (Pounds 753,000). Last time's figures
also included contributions from the brand division sold to its management
in December 1993.
Stirling made provisions of Pounds 1.8m for the imports closure, of which
only Pounds 1.59m was required.
The interim dividend is lifted 9 per cent to 0.6p, payable from earnings per
share of 1.7p (losses 0.06p).

FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Southern Water turns in 9.8% advance to
Pounds 70.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Southern Water, one of the 10 biggest water groups, confirmed the strong
tone in the industry by reporting a 9.8 per cent increase in interim pre-tax
profits from Pounds 64.5m to Pounds 70.8m.
Sales in the six months to September 30 climbed 10.9 per cent to Pounds
190.6m with the help of a 29 per cent increase in the company's non-water
activities, while turnover on the regulated water side grew by 5.7 per cent
to Pounds 169.5m.
The improvement triggered a 9.7 per cent dividend increase to 8.45p. The
shares gained 31p to close at 570p.
Southern's advance came despite a 40 per cent rise in investment spending to
Pounds 104m. This should decline in the second half to reach a full-year
Pounds 185m. However, capital outflows will remain a heavy drain as Southern
plans to spend Pounds 1.2bn over the next five years to meet new urban waste
water standards.
The rise in interim profits came through a mixture of higher sales, tight
cost controls and limited acquisitions.
Costs on the regulated side remained virtually stable. The main increase in
expenses came in Southern's non-regulated businesses, where it has expanded
into such areas as quantity surveying and environmental services.
Earnings per share rose 7.9 per cent to 39.8p.
COMMENT
Southern Water's no-surprises interim results, backed by this week's strong
performance in the water regulator's league table of service standards,
confirms its image as one of the best-run groups. Heavy capital spending
will continue to overshadow earnings, but the damage may be limited by
cost-cutting and innovations such as new technology to remove pesticides
from waste water much more cheaply. Southern's relatively high K-factor in
Ofwat's review also supplies some headroom. Whether that will be enough to
produce an earnings and dividend surge is unlikely. But Southern's strength
compared with its rivals has been its consistent profits and dividends
growth. A likely 9 to 10 per cent rise in the full-year dividend to about
25p - a prospective yield of about 5.5 per cent - and a similar-sized
increase in profits to between Pounds 135m and Pounds 140m should cement
that reputation.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Trafalgar House Stalks Northern Electric: A logical target
and digestible, but easy game? - Northern Electric
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why, with 12 regional electricity companies to choose from, has Trafalgar
House fixed its sights on Northern Electric?
The choice came as no surprise to the electricity industry, where Northern
has long been seen as the prime takeover target.
Its relatively small size makes it readily digestible - though at last
night's stock market close it was worth Pounds 1.25bn - and a reputation for
lacklustre management would attract predators which think they can do
better.
Another reason could be that Trafalgar has a large presence of its own in
north-east England, which Northern serves from its base in Newcastle. But
the key question is whether Northern is really as vulnerable as the market
thinks.
Much of Northern's reputation is based on financial analysts' personal
impressions of Mr David Morris, the chairman, and his executives, who come
across as rather stuffy and remote.
The company has also been less aggressive than some of its southern rivals
in cutting costs, and though this week's results showed profits up 20 per
cent and the dividend up 16 per cent, this was only average in an industry
famous for spectacular numbers.
Northern has also bought back a chunk of its shares, and reduced its debt,
which puts it in a strong financial position. But, again, this is standard
practice in the industry.
Against that, though, Northern has taken a number of bold steps which have
marked it out from the pack, and caused some analysts to adjust their views.
The most conspicuous was its decision to expand outside its region and sell
electricity to big commercial and industrial customers.
Northern now has the largest supply business of any rec: it sells
electricity to nearly 200 Marks and Spencer stores around the country, for
example. In the last six months it boosted these profits by Pounds 10m.
Like other recs, Northern has also expanded into the gas business. But
rather than just act as a distributor, it went a stage further and bought a
share in a North Sea gas field in partnership with Neste, a large Finnish
energy company. With other recs now complaining that they are being squeezed
in the gas market, Northern has access to its own gas and could therefore be
in a stronger position.
In September Northern took another innovative step by offering to buy back
its shares through an agent rather than directly, a technique which could be
more tax advantageous for shareholders than the straightforward buy-backs
used by most other recs.
But Northern's efforts have earned, at best, mixed reviews. Critics
attribute the success of the supply business to the fact that electricity
generation prices have been capped by the regulator - but only temporarily.
When the cap comes off, Northern could find itself marooned by rising
prices. Similarly, some analysts are reserving judgment on the gas strategy
because of the uncertainties in the market, and on the tax credits until
they are approved by the Inland Revenue.
This suggests that while Northern may have polished up its act, it still
lacks the credibility enjoyed by some other rec managements who have
persuaded the markets that they really know what they are doing.
But Northern will fight a bid, and it clearly thinks it has done
sufficiently well by both its customers and shareholders to be able to count
on their backing.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Trafalgar House Stalks Northern Electric: Trafalgar action
puts industry on defensive - A hostile bid for an electricity utility has
political ramifications as well as stirring up an already agitated sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until yesterday the received wisdom among executives of the English and
Welsh regional electricity companies was that they were safe from hostile
predators. 'There are not enough costs left to be cut out to make it
worthwhile for an aggressor to pay a hostile bid premium,' said one chief
executive yesterday morning.
Trafalgar House, the engineering and construction group, is not convinced,
as its afternoon statement confirmed. And if it goes ahead with the takeover
bid it has been considering for Northern Electric, it will be upsetting more
than just the sector executives' sense of security about remaining
independent.
The repercussions of a bid will be felt far beyond the north-east of
England, which is the electricity company's base, and far beyond the sector.
A bid would have significant political implications, with power
privatisation a growing focus of political debate.
Yesterday, shares of all 12 regional electricity companies rose strongly as
analysts and investors digested the implications of the first moves towards
a contested takeover in the sector since it was privatised four years ago.
Other companies considered vulnerable to takeovers included South Wales
Electricity, South Western Electricity, Seeboard, based in the south-east,
and Cheshire-based Manweb.
With one prospective hostile bidder already having shown its hand, others
are more likely to emerge, either to enter the fray for Northern, or to
focus on another target before it is swallowed up.
Potential bidders could include US utilities seeking a stream of earnings
outside their own tightly regulated areas or UK conglomerates such as
Hanson.
The 12 companies may feel forced into each other's arms. Most industry
executives would prefer to get together with another regional electricity
company rather than face the risk of a non-sector company taking them over.
The urge to merge may become overwhelming for some.
But a second line of defence will be to accelerate the process of passing
out any 'hidden value' in the companies to shareholders before a hostile
predator promises to do it for them.
That makes an intensification of cost-cutting and job shedding inevitable.
It also increases the likelihood, already strong, that the National Grid
will be floated next year. Many analysts believe that the Grid's value is
not yet fully reflected in the 12 companies' share prices and will not
become so until it is fully demerged from their ownership.
All these developments will take place in the full public glare. The Labour
Party has sensed that it can win votes through its attacks on electricity
privatisation and has been on the attack this week over job losses and the
National Grid flotation, which it says will benefit rec shareholders greatly
but customers and the taxpayer far less.
The government's inclination will be to intervene in electricity as little
as possible and to let the market decide the industry's future. However, its
ownership of a golden share in each of the recs and the National Grid until
April 1 means that it has the power to intervene, and Labour may challenge
it to do so.
Even after the golden share ends, the government may have to confront wider
competition issues if merger mania leads to widespread consolidation. By
some estimates, today's 12 companies could shake down into four or five
super-utilities, possibly owning regional water and gas companies as well.
The role of Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry
regulator, will also come under close public scrutiny.
In the eyes of the Labour Party he is one of the villains of the piece,
since it is under his regulation that the companies have been able to become
so profitable and therefore so attractive to predators.
There are likely to be calls on Prof Littlechild to ensure that consumers
are protected, for example by ring-fencing cash piles accrued by the
companies so that bidders cannot use them for non-electricity purposes.
But like the government, Prof Littlechild is a strong believer in the market
and is unlikely to want to intervene simply to preserve the industry
structure introduced at privatisation in 1990.
The structure was inherited from pre-privatisation days. The government
considered various options, but in the end decided to privatise the regional
electricity structure as it was. The 12 area boards thus became 12 regional
companies.
'The whole industry was being changed,' said one former government adviser
yesterday. 'We were breaking up the Central Electricity Generation Board but
the area distribution structure seemed not unreasonable because it had been
developed over a number of years.'
If the government's decision against reforming the regional electricity
structure has proved uncontroversial, the same cannot be said of the price
regulation it put in place.
Even the executives of the companies acknowledge, in retrospect, that the
targets for cutting prices in the distribution businesses which provide
their main income have proved to be extremely lax.
The companies have been able to cut costs by far more than they expected,
largely through implementing reductions in workforces of more than 25 per
cent on average. Distribution prices have meanwhile been able to rise.
The result is that the companies have become considerably more profitable
than they were intended to be and have been able to accrue large cash piles.
The sector's shares have performed better than any other in the past four
years.
Nor is the share price growth expected to end there. Prof Littlechild is
widely viewed to have missed the opportunity to rein in the companies'
profitability in the regulatory review he announced in August, and which is
to be implemented next April.
Stockbrokers' analysts believe that virtually all companies will be able to
increase their dividends by about 8 per cent a year in real terms for the
next four years at least.
In the current results season, rises of more than 20 per cent have been the
norm. In utility stocks dividend growth is one of the key assessment
criteria.
All of this means that even following recent share price rises, many
stockbroking analysts have been advising their clients to buy at least some
of the companies in the sector.
Whichever predators move in, they will have to reckon with a steadily
toughening competitive climate. Prof Littlechild is liberalising the
electricity market so that by 1998, all the regional barriers will be gone
and each distributor will be able to sell wherever he likes. No country in
the world will have such an open electricity market, and the uncertainties
will be considerable.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Trafalgar House Stalks Northern Electric: Suspicions on both
sides about the motives of Hongkong Land - The institutions react
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar House could face an uphill struggle if it decides to bid for
Northern Electric. The resistance is not, as one might expect, only going to
come from Northern's shareholders, but from its own investors.
They are deeply suspicious of the motives behind Trafalgar's interest, in
spite of the obvious tax benefits the company would derive from a UK
earnings stream.
Some fear Trafalgar could become a pawn in the political games being played
by its major shareholder, Hongkong Land, the property arm of Jardine
Matheson. Jardine has been anxious to invest its funds internationally in
advance of the transfer of Hong Kong to China in 1997.
'One has to ask if one is acquiring a stream of earnings and cash flow which
is beneficial to Trafalgar House or to Hongkong Land,' said one investor.
The dilemma is intensified for shareholders who have been in Trafalgar for
some time. 'Trafalgar has been a poor investment,' said one institution.
'Yet Hongkong came in and rescued the company. Perhaps this is the price we
have to pay for Trafalgar not going bust.'
Some feared that any arrangement to fund a bid could allow Hongkong Land to
acquire outright control without making a full offer.
'I am positive that Hongkong Land will end up owning the majority of
Trafalgar,' said an institution. 'And they will have bought the company on
the cheap.'
However, he was resigned to such an outcome. 'If a Trafalgar without
Hongkong Land were still solvent, and were bid for, it is unlikely the
bidder would have to pay a premium.'
For Northern's shareholders, any approach from a company with Trafalgar's
track record would probably be unwelcome.
A paper offer appears out of the question. 'That would in effect be a
disguised rights for Trafalgar and we would not support that,' said a
Northern Electric investor.
A cash bid would have to take account of the long-term value offered by
utilities, and the high quality of earnings they provide. This means that a
cash offer would have to be substantially in excess of last night's 1010p
closing share price.
There is a further complication in that most of the institutions are not
even sure themselves what the right value should be for Northern shares.
For example, there is substantial value yet to be realised from the
flotation of the National Grid, which is estimated to be valued at more than
Pounds 4bn. Northern's share could be worth more than Pounds 260m, of which
a substantial proportion would find its way to investors.
Most of the electricity companies have been in an extended closed period,
due to discussions on the National Grid and the results season. 'They have
not really been able to talk freely with shareholders,' said one investor.
'So it is difficult for institutions to be sure of the value to be given to
such issues.'
Value might not be such an insurmountable obstacle, however. 'It is possible
that in its efforts to move funds out of Hong Kong, the Jardine empire might
be willing to pay more for Northern, on the basis of strategic reasons, than
other companies might for industrial reasons,' one shareholder said.
But most investors might find an approach from a fellow utility - such as
Scottish Power - easier to take. 'One could stay in the sector and reap the
obvious operational benefits,' an institution said.
Another investor thought this was the most likely scenario and said he
expected 'a third party to enter the frame.'
This is perhaps the most significant effect of yesterday's announcement.
'The company has been put into play, there is no doubt about that,' Mr Kevin
Lapwood, of brokers Smith New Court said. 'The chances of it being
independent in six months' time are very slim.'

FT  15 DEC 94 / Trafalgar House Stalks Northern Electric: Sid in middle of
an unfamiliar battleground - What it means for investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Trafalgar House goes ahead with its bid, it would mark the first takeover
of one of the more than two dozen utility companies which have been
privatised over the last 10 years, writes David Lascelles.
Sid, the proverbial private, first-time investor, who bought many of these
stocks, could therefore find himself in the thick of an unfamiliar battle.
As of last June, Northern had 123,000 shareholders, more than 97 per cent of
whom held fewer than 1,000 shares. But though they represent the numerical
majority, their tiny holdings mean that they account for only 20 per cent of
the vote.
Nearly 80 per cent is held by big investment institutions. The government
only holds one share, but that is an overriding golden share which will
expire next March.
While Sid's relatively small holding means that he would play only a minor
role in a takeover battle, the bidder's financial advisers will have to take
account of his unfamiliarity with bid procedures.
His presence could also sharpen political controversy over the bid if, as
seems likely, Labour uses it to have a go at the alleged financial excesses
of the electricity companies.
So far, only two well-known privatised companies have been subjected to
takeovers: Britoil and Jaguar, and in neither case did the government use
its golden share to block them.
Sid has done well out of Northern. He paid 240p for the shares at
privatisation in early 1990, and last night they stood at more than Pounds
10.
He has also recouped a third of his original outlay in dividends.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Trafalgar House Stalks Northern Electric: Deep pockets in
search of stable profits - Trafalgar House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a company to be contemplating a Pounds 1bn-plus takeover bid only two
years after it nearly went under might appear to be evidence of a miraculous
corporate recovery. But it has more to do with the deep pockets of Jardine
Matheson than a turnround at Trafalgar House.
Jardine dropped anchor off Trafalgar at the end of 1992, when the
conglomerate built up by Sir Nigel Broackes was taking on water. Hongkong
Land, Jardine's property arm, captured 15 per cent of the shares and later
increased its stake to 25 per cent.
Whatever the Jardine camp thought at the time, it soon found itself at the
helm of a ship that was sinking rapidly. Trafalgar had incurred losses in
1991, although it originally reported a profit, and these mounted in 1992 as
it was forced to make heavy write-downs on its large property portfolio.
Trafalgar had raised Pounds 310m from a rights issue at the time of its
ill-fated acquisition of Davy Corporation in 1991 and a further Pounds 204m
in March 1993. But the write-downs, as well as provisions against the value
of its Cunard cruise ships, the Ritz hotel and Davy's Emerald North Sea rig,
left its balance sheet badly holed. Exactly a year ago, Trafalgar announced
the terms of a convertible preference share issue to raise Pounds 400m.
Trafalgar is now valued at Pounds 1.2bn, only Pounds 200m more than
investors have injected over the past three years.
Jardine now calls the shots at Trafalgar and Mr Simon Keswick, whose family
controls Jardine, took over as chairman in 1992.
During the 1960s and 1970s, Trafalgar bought a wide range of companies such
as Cunard, the Ritz and the Express newspaper group (floated off in 1982).
In the 1980s, it became the world's fourth largest engineering and
construction contractor with acquisitions including Redpath Dorman Long,
Scott Lithgow, John Brown and, ultimately, Davy.
But after Trafalgar recorded profits of Pounds 266m in 1989, the recession
nearly snuffed it out. Over the past three years, it has lost almost Pounds
400m before tax. Trafalgar's tax losses and unrelieved advance corporation
tax could shelter a large part of Northern Electric's profits.
Mr Nigel Rich, the Jardine man installed as chief executive in August, is
likely to argue that Northern's stable profits stream will offset
Trafalgar's highly cyclical earnings. Trafalgar's other shareholders may not
see it quite that way. Many bought into the shares as a play on cyclical
recovery, which is yet to come, and may not wish to see that diluted by
Northern's utility profits.
Mr Gavin Launder, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, commented: 'It may be a
sensible move for Jardine but it is hard to see how it is very good news for
Trafalgar House.'
Though some overseas opportunities may be opened by combining Trafalgar's
electrical engineering skills with Northern's expertise in power generation
and distribution, the business fit is minimal.
For Jardine, a takeover of Northern would be a way to exchange Hong Kong
cash for UK profits.
Given Northern's strong cash generation, a large part of the purchase price
could be funded by debt. The rest is expected to be met from the proceeds of
a share issue, probably of convertible preference shares, underwritten by
Hongkong Land. Some shareholders yesterday voiced concern that this might
allow Hongkong Land 'to buy control on the cheap'. But they also recognise
that without Jardine, Trafalgar might by now have gone to the breakers'
yard.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Hickson names board to oversee safety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hickson International, the speciality chemicals manufacturer hit by two big
industrial accidents in recent years, yesterday became Britain's first
chemicals company to appoint an independent supervisory board to oversee
health and safety.
The move is designed to reassure investors and community groups that Hickson
will pursue the highest possible safety standards. It follows an explosion
two years ago which killed five workers at Castleford in West Yorkshire, a
fire in 1993 at Ringaskiddy in Ireland, and a Pounds 50,000 fine earlier
this year for excessive emissions at Castleford.
Mr Dennis Kerrison, chief executive, blamed the problems on under-investment
during the 1980s, but said Hickson had spent Pounds 30.2m on improving its
health, safety and environmental controls in the past three years. Yesterday
he welcomed the supervisory board as 'a leap forward in improving safety
standards'.
The board, which will publish details of Hickson's safety record, is to be
headed by Mr Keith Humphreys, chairman and managing director of the UK arm
of Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemical group, and former president of the
Chemical Industries Association. 'This supervisory board will be a first in
the UK. It elevates health, safety and environmental issues to the
appropriate level within a chemical company,' he said yesterday.
The idea of a supervisory board was first mooted by Mr James Hann, the
part-time chairman of Scottish Nuclear, the state-owned nuclear power
company, who became non-executive chairman of Hickson in October. Such
boards have existed in the nuclear industry for some time.
At Hickson, it will monitor the effectiveness of measures introduced
following recent accidents, which include the creation of a 'corporate
crisis management team', remedial programmes for older sites, and a review
of emergency procedures.
Hickson plans to devote some Pounds 6m a year, about 30 per cent of total
capital expenditure, to health and safety.
Some City analysts warned that the move reflected increasing pressure on
European chemical companies to invest heavily to comply with environmental
regulations. That could prove a heavy drain on companies relying on elderly
plant and equipment. Hickson, for example, has been making chemicals at
Castleford since 1915.
Mr Martin Evans, chemicals analyst at Hoare Govett, said: 'It shows they're
increasingly determined to improve their image after an unfortunate
succession of events. But it will take some time.'

FT  15 DEC 94 / Standard Chartered to cut staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Chartered, the UK-based international bank, yesterday said it was
to reduce staff by about 3,000 - 10 per cent of its workforce - in the
medium term to cut costs.
The bank, which experienced a 7 per cent rise in operating expenses in the
first half, said it had shed about 1,000 of these jobs this year through
re-structuring of some operations and voluntary severance schemes.
It is also thought to have shed a significant number of jobs in India and
Kenya during 1994, although cuts are likely to affect operations throughout
the world.
The bank said it could not set a precise timetable for reaching its 3,000
target.
Standard Chartered said it believed its plans were in line with those of
other banks. US banks have been imposing cost-cutting programmes recently,
with Chemical Banking announcing plans to shed 3,700 jobs.
Standard Chartered's cost/income ratio in the six months to August 10 was
63.8 per cent. The bank has set a medium-term target of reducing the ratio
to 60 per cent, and wants to cut the ratio eventually to about 55 per cent.
The bank has been trying to reduce costs by moving some of its back office
processing from high-wage centres such as Hong Kong into China and other
lower-cost areas, as well as centralising more processing.
The job cuts were disclosed at a briefing in Hong Kong, and Standard said it
could give no further details. However, it is also likely to shed some
peripheral operations in countries where it has relatively small market
shares.
The bank has been particularly affected by high inflation in some countries,
notably Hong Kong, sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. This raised staff
costs from Pounds 258m to Pounds 285m in the first half of the year.
Mr Patrick Gillam, the chairman, said in his first half statement that the
bank would impose 'rigorous control of costs'. It has been trying to make
operating procedures more efficient as it has brought local operations under
regional control.

FT  15 DEC 94 / BP unveils ambitious performance targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Petroleum has announced that it wants to boost profits by 50 per
cent within two years, and cut its debt by about Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.8bn),
without any help from higher oil prices.
Mr David Simon, chief executive, unveiled the performance targets, the first
since a boardroom coup plunged the company into crisis 2 1/2 years ago, at a
presentation to City of London analysts and institutional shareholders
yesterday.
He said BP had established a track record in meeting the key financial
targets it had set for itself at the time of the crisis. The company was now
healthy enough move on to a new set of goals. BP's strategic emphasis over
the next two years will be on 'improved profitability, disciplined growth
and a strong balance sheet'.
BP's profits in the first nine months of this year were Dollars 1.59bn. It
wants to increase annual replacement cost earnings to Dollars 3bn a year
within two years. Mr Simon said this was possible even if oil prices remain
around the present, relatively low, level of Dollars 16 a barrel for the
benchmark Brent Blend. He conceded that a fall to the Dollars 12-Dollars 14
seen earlier this year would force BP to re-consider the timing of its
targets.
Higher product volumes, new technology, cost reductions, improved
organisational structures and lower interest charges would all contribute to
the planned earnings improvement.
The importance of a strong balance sheet meant BP wanted to reduce its debt
of Dollars 10.8bn to about Dollars 8bn by 1996. That would bring down
gearing from about 60 per cent to 30-35 per cent, a figure more in line with
BP's peers in the international oil industry.
The company expected to increase its capital spending to about Dollars 4.5bn
next year, from less than Dollars 4bn in 1994. Mr Simon said improved
productivity meant the company could maintain itself on an annual capital
expenditure of Dollars 3.5bn. The additional Dollars 1bn would be devoted to
growth of existing or new projects.
Mr Simon, who is to take over as chairman next July, declined to comment on
possible increases to BP's dividend, except to say that increases could
'only be justified on the basis of sustained performance improvement'. He
also denied that the company would use its strong free cash flow to buy back
its shares.
Mr John Browne, head of exploration and production, who will take over from
Mr Simon next year, also announced that BP had found enough oil and gas to
replace its 1994 production. It expects to expand production by 2 per cent
over the next three years.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Credit Suisse top contender for Budapest Bank stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Suisse, part of the CS Holding financial services group, has emerged
as the top contender to take a controlling stake in Budapest Bank, a
Hungarian state-owned bank.
If completed, the deal would be Credit Suisse's first foreign acquisition in
commercial banking and involve the largest single investment by a western
bank in eastern Europe.
A committee of the Hungarian finance minister, the privatisation
commissioner and the managing director of Budapest Bank, Mr Lajos Bokros, is
to take the decision. It is believed to favour Credit Suisse above the other
two bidders, ING Bank of the Netherlands and Allied Irish of Ireland.
Credit Suisse confirmed it had put in an offer but said it was unaware it
had been preferred. 'We have an interest in the bank. Whether it is the bid
that is going to the government we don't know', a spokesman said. The
Hungarian authorities said that there were three bidders.
Credit Suisse still has to conduct a 'due diligence' evaluation of Budapest
Bank and agree precise terms with the Hungarian authorities.
But government officials have, through their advisers Salomon Brothers, said
they will consider the sale of the majority stake that Credit Suisse would
demand.
The investor would pay about Dollars 100m (Pounds 61m) into the company for
its stake, taking Budapest Bank's capital above the 8 per cent of assets
target set by the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements.
Credit Suisse recently opened a branch in Moscow and the acquisition in
Hungary would allow Credit Suisse to pursue its strategy of seeking 'home
markets' outside its native Switzerland.
Credit Suisse's expansion into eastern Europe will allow CS Holding to offer
a full range of financial services in the region. Credit Suisse would be
following CS First Boston, the subsidiary of CS Holding, which has become
the leading international investment bank in the region with offices in
Moscow, Budapest, Prague and Warsaw.
The bid for Budapest Bank comes after the collapse of talks with
Creditanstalt Bankverein of Austria, which would have brought its east
European commercial banking operations to its proposed alliance with Credit
Suisse.
Budapest Bank is the third significant commercial bank in the region to be
offered to western investors from the sector.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Shareholders raise stakes in Saatchi battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle between Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's dissident shareholders and Mr Maurice
Saatchi, chairman and founder of the advertising group, intensified
yesterday when shareholders formally requested that Mr Saatchi should be
removed from the board.
Mr David Herro, of US fund manager Harris Associates, has written to
Saatchi's directors saying that if the board does not take action, a group
of shareholders will call an extraordinary meeting which will 'include the
resolution to remove the chairman of the board'.
The letter was written on behalf of Harris, the State of Wisconsin
Investment Board and General Electric Pension Trust, which together control
24.8 per cent of Saatchi. Extraordinary meetings can be called by any
shareholders controlling more than 10 per cent of a company.
Mr Herro said last night that he has the support of several other big
shareholders and believes he is speaking for more than 40 per cent of the
shares.
'Our main complaint is that we feel the chairman is putting his own
interests before those of the company or his shareholders,' he said.
Saatchi's board will consider Mr Herro's demand at a board meeting on
Friday. Directors said the vote could go either way, but Mr Herro said he
was optimistic they would 'do the right thing'.
One Saatchi director said he was extremely concerned about the possible
damage to the company if there was a public battle between shareholders and
the board in the seven weeks preceding an extraordinary meeting.
The fight between shareholders and Mr Saatchi has come to a head because of
their fury at a proposal that Mr Saatchi should receive a Pounds 5m option
package.
However Mr Herro has been concerned for nearly a year that Mr Saatchi's
entrepreneurial style is unsuited to the chairmanship of a public company.
He alleges, for example, that earlier this year Mr Saatchi wished to remove
the group's chief executive, Mr Charles Scott. 'All Scott had done was to
try to reduce holding company expenses', said Mr Herro.
Mr Herro also wants the board to drop 'Saatchi' from the holding company
name, to prevent potential damage to subsidiaries which do not have that
word in their names. A name change is supported by non-executives, but Mr
Saatchi has said he may quit if his surname is dropped.
Mr Saatchi has warned directors that big clients may take their business to
other agencies if he leaves. However, Mr Herro is sceptical about this. Mr
Saatchi is particularly close to two clients, Mars and British Airways.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Industrial tribunal reform aimed at reducing delays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial tribunals will have the power to weed out weak cases under reform
proposals put forward by the government yesterday aimed at reducing tribunal
delays and raising standards.
The change is part of a package of proposals in a green paper which,
however, draws back from radical reform of the industrial tribunal system
despite calls from both employers and unions for a wholesale review. Both
have complained of delays and excessive legal interference.
The green paper concentrates on efficiency measures such as imposing time
limits on proceedings and deciding on written evidence where both parties
agree.
Controversial proposals to charge applicants fees to enter claims as a means
of discouraging weak claims have been rejected by the government.
The green paper says there should be special pre-hearings and cases could
also be dismissed during the course of proceedings.
It recommends all cases, other than those on unfair dismissal and
discrimination, should be heard by tribunal chairmen alone. Tribunals at
present have two lay members, in addition to the legally trained chairman,
representing the interests of employers and employees.
Industrial tribunals' caseloads rose by 150 per cent in the five years to
1993-94 to reach 73,000 cases. The administrative budget has increased by 75
per cent since 1988 to Pounds 26.6m this year.
The CBI said the document was timely and that there was room for improvement
in the existing service to all users. The Engineering Employers Federation
welcomed further proposals to promote voluntary binding settlements as an
alternative to a full tribunal hearing.
The Labour Party condemned the proposals as 'a sacker's charter' and Mr John
Monks, TUC general secretary, described the green paper as a 'missed
opportunity' to increase security at work and strengthen legal guarantees of
justice.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Bankruptcy ruling a blow to Tapie's political ambitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The political career of Mr Bernard Tapie, the French populist radical,
appeared to have been marred last night by a decision of the Paris
commercial court to put personal companies of the former tycoon into
liquidation.
Under French law, people declared bankrupt are banned from holding office
for five years.
Mr Tapie had been mentioned as a leftwing candidate for the presidency to
fill something of the void left after Mr Jacques Delors' decision not to run
as the Socialist candidate. He had also shown every intention of running for
mayor of Marseilles next year. Mr Tapie, who has been fighting a series of
tax, football bribery and corporate investigations by appealing against
every court ruling against him, said last night that he would appeal against
yesterday's decision.
But it is likely to remove any presidential or mayoral hopes he may have
had. It was not clear last night whether the ruling would allow him to
continue as a national deputy and a Euro MP.
The Paris court yesterday ruled that two of Mr Tapie's companies, personally
underwritten by Mr Tapie and his wife, Dominique, should be liquidated
because their 'liabilities far exceeded their assets' - his Paris mansion
and his Marseilles yacht.
A lawyer for Credit Lyonnais, the troubled state bank which has been
pursuing Mr Tapie for the FFr1.2bn (Pounds 142m) he owes it, said the
decision might cost the bank FFr1bn, apparently because the state had first
call on Mr Tapie for unpaid tax.
The ruling blocks Credit Lyonnais' planned auction today of Mr Tapie's
17th-century Paris mansion. Its future will be decided by a court-appointed
liquidator. Mr Tapie still faces other court cases concerning the fate of
his industrial holdings, consisting chiefly of a health food chain and
makers of weighing machines.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Russians close to taking Grozny
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian army was poised to take the Chechen capital of Grozny last night
after peace talks broke down and heavy fighting flared on the outskirts of
the city.
Russian tanks, drawn up on a ridge overlooking the city, pounded Chechen
forces to the north of the capital as aircraft fired rockets into the
suburbs.
The three Russian army divisions which invaded Chechyna on Sunday are now to
the north, east and west of Grozny and many Chechens now expect a full-scale
assault. Russian President Boris Yeltsin's deadline for the surrender of the
Chechen leadership expires today.
Early yesterday, Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev warned on television of a
'life or death war' in which his citizens would have to defend their
country. His statement came as Chechen delegates walked out of peace talks
with Russian officials in the town of Vladikavkaz in neighbouring North
Ossetia.
In three days of clashes, 70 Russian soldiers and 50 Chechen civilians are
reported to have been killed.

<TEXT>
The Russian army was poised to take the Chechen capital of Grozny last
night.
Its forward tank division was drawn up on a ridge overlooking the suburbs,
and the town shook to a heavy bombardment of its northern outskirts.
As the deadline given by Russian president Boris Yeltsin for the surrender
of the Chechen leadership was due to expire, there were reports in the
capital that the commanders of the Russian army's northern division were
preparing to take the city.
Before dawn yesterday, General Dzhokar Dudayev, the Chechen president, told
his beleaguered rebel nation in a television address: 'This is a war for
life or death. All our citizens must know that we have to defend our country
and our life.'
Tamisha Mashidova heard president Dudayev's broadcast in the military
hospital, where she works as a ward sister and as an organiser of a movement
called 'the National Patriotic Society of Mothers and Sisters'.
Later, she went up in the hospital minibus to collect other nurses from the
village of Pervomaisk, in the Grozny suburbs. As she reached it, she saw
lines of Russian tanks drawn up on a ridge above the town: as she stopped,
two fighters circled overhead, then dived towards her, loosening off
rockets.
Emerging from cover, she saw that a reporter from the local TV station and a
Chechen fighter, had been hit, the fighter badly. She and her colleagues
loaded them into the bus and bumped back to the hospital. Behind her, a
bombardment began.
The three Russian divisions which invaded Chechnya on Sunday are now to the
north, east and west of the city. The western group, which came through
heavy opposition in the neighbouring republic of Ingushetia had last night
halted in the town Davydenko, some 30 miles west of Grozny. The eastern
group has also advanced slowly from Dagestan, and is said by the Chechen
military to be near the town of Gudermes in the east. The closest division
and the one which has sustained the heaviest fighting has advanced near
Grozny. Supported by jet fighters, it was last night conducting an artillery
and rocket attack on the outlying areas of the city.
Peace talks that had gone on since Monday in the city of Vladikavkaz across
the Chechen border broke up yesterday with no agreement - as both sides had
expected. According to Mr Usman Imayev the Chechen procurator, they failed
when the Chechen delegation led by Mr Taimaz Abubakarov, the finance
minister, refused to recognise the sovereignty of Russia over Chechnya.
which declared its independence in 1991.
Back in the cold, badly equipped hospital, doctors picked the shrapnel out
of Gilani Chasigov's legs. The TV reporter said: 'I saved my film. I'll put
it on the air tonight if there is power. Watch it and you'll see they're
firing at anyone, women, people in the streets, vehicles with white flags
and 'first aid' written on them.'

FT  15 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Yield curves
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
World bond markets are in the throes of 'curve compression'. In the past few
weeks there has been a swift flattening of yield curves, with long-term
interest rates dropping as short and medium-term rates have risen.
The trigger for the flattening, the most rapid since the early 1980s, is the
tough monetary stance being taken by the US Federal Reserve. Investors are
expecting further US rate rises of up to 75 basis points within three months
with another 50 points coming shortly afterwards. The Fed should be given
credit for its recent monetary rectitude, but markets may be getting ahead
of themselves.
A flattening yield curve usually indicates a slowing economy and the
imminent approach of peak interest rates. These conditions are not fulfilled
in the US. First, the economy is steaming ahead and weakness is not likely
to show itself until next spring. Second, it is uncertain that the Fed will
move in the way markets expect: after all, it has already tightened more
aggressively than most expected earlier in the year.
The UK and the economies of Australia and New Zealand follow the US economic
cycle more closely than those of continental Europe. It is thus
understandable that yield curves have taken their cue from the US, even if
the same objections remain. In the UK, for example, a burst of consumer
spending in the run-up to Christmas could make the beginning of a downturn
look remote and interest rates have a long way to go before they peak.
There is still less reason for the curve compression which has taken place
in Germany, where the economy lags the US by at least 18 months. Here, the
next move in rates could as well be down as up. If it is up, the move is
unlikely to come until the second half of next year. In Germany, as in other
bond markets, the flattening of yield curves looks premature.

FT  15 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar House
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Trafalgar House bids for Northern, much will be made of potential
synergies: in particular, how a cyclical engineering and construction
business benefits from acquiring dependable utility profits. But the issues
dominating the debate are likely to be tax, and the motives of Trafalgar's
largest shareholder, Hongkong Land, which would underwrite any funding.
Since Hongkong Land bought into Trafalgar in 1992, shareholders have
suffered asset write-downs and two rights issues. Those that remained have
done so because they expect a sharp recovery over the next three years -
hence Trafalgar's prospective price-earnings ratio of over 20.
With such a high p/e, virtually any acquisition would enhance earnings in
the short run. But given that Northern's earnings profile is dull, profits
growth will be less spectacular. Tax could answer such concerns. Northern's
profits and the impending Grid demerger will create substantial tax
liabilities. Trafalgar has written off close to Pounds 200m of Advance
Corporation Tax, due to the recent profits collapse. This ACT could be
revived as a meaningful asset.
How would an offer be funded? The most obvious options - a big rights issue
or borrowing that leads to gearing over 100 per cent - are unappealing. An
offer of convertible preference shares would be a logical alternative. If
they are non-redeemable, they would count as equity rather than debt, even
under the latest accounting standards, so protecting Trafalgar from high
gearing. They would also postpone earnings dilution and offer a slightly
lower risk investment for institutional investors.
But that is where Hongkong Land enters the picture. It has Dollars 7.7bn of
net assets, virtually no debt and serious misgivings about the future of
Hong Kong. Underwriting a Trafalgar convertible issue could enable it to
channel more cash into the UK and gain control of Trafalgar, following
conversion, without paying other shareholders a premium. Trafalgar will need
to convince investors that this is not the game plan or it could derail any
bid.

FT  15 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Electric shock
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar House has sent a shock through the electricity sector. At the
minimum, news that it may bid for Northern Electric will force all 12
regional electricity companies to pay greater attention to shareholder
value. The move could also trigger consolidation of the industry.
Northern is vulnerable because it has done relatively little to cut costs.
So a more aggressive management may be able to squeeze greater value from
its assets. But whether Northern falls will depend on how much Trafalgar is
prepared to pay. Shareholders are unlikely to be interested in an offer of
less than Pounds 8 a share in cash plus whatever net proceeds Northern
receives from demerging its stake in the National Grid - worth perhaps a
further Pounds 2 a share.
Northern's best defence will be to improve earnings per share by gearing up
its balance sheet through large dividends or share buy-backs. With a stable
monopoly franchise, the company could manage gearing of over 50 per cent.
Though Northern has already bought back 10 per cent of its equity, it is
still ungeared.
The alternative defence - seeking a white knight - could be futile. Other
companies, notably Scottish Power, are thought to have looked at Northern.
But why would they become embroiled in a bidding war with Trafalgar when
they have 11 other recs to choose from?
Such thinking points to copycat bids or mergers rather than counterbids. For
bidders outside the industry, the logic of buying a rec would be that they
could manage it better - unless, like Trafalgar, they can also use up tax
losses. For other electricity companies, the logic is different: merging two
recs could eliminate duplication in head offices, customer services and
billing systems. That could save up to Pounds 50m a year, though not all the
benefits would go to shareholders. The industry's regulator has said that
customers must receive their cut.
While intra-rec mergers could make sense, it would be a mistake if they were
embarked on for defensive reasons. Shareholders would not be pleased if two
fearful recs joined forces as a way of avoiding tough decisions on
cost-cutting. It would be better to remain independent, cut costs and gear
up balance sheets.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Personal View: The looking glass view of Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WILLIAMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost everything that happens in the European Union is public knowledge
within an hour or two. The European Commission in Brussels is one of the
most open public services in the world and we all like it that way. It is
therefore surprising to find that, recently, some commentators seem to see
Europe not through the looking glass but through the distorting mirror. This
applies particularly to what 'Brussels' is alleged to be imposing on the
European citizen.
A few facts. First, all significant decisions in the EU, with the exception
of those relating to competition (for example state aids) are taken not by
bureaucrats but by UK ministers and their colleagues in the Council of
Ministers. The Commission proposes, the Council and the parliament decide.
Recent Treaty changes have increased the parliament's control over the
Commission. This is a genuinely democratic system.
The budget in the EU is fixed by the Council and the parliament. About 97.5
per cent of public expenditure in the EU is national expenditure by the
member states. The Community budget represents about 2.5 per cent. It is
subject to fixed limits on all main types of expenditure. That is why last
year the Commission kept about 1,000 posts vacant because there was no
money. When we underspend the budget, there is usually silence in the media.
In 1994 we shall underspend the budget on agriculture by about Pounds 2.7bn.
Second, the European Commission is a lean machine. We could have taken a
different, centralising approach and established a huge bureaucracy in
Brussels to administer directly all grants and schemes. I am glad that this
approach was not followed. There are many million national civil servants in
the member states but less than 15,000 officials on the operating budget of
the European Commission (about one fifth are required because we work in
nine languages).
It follows that, although the Commission has the final responsibility for
the execution of the budget, most of the operations, probably about 80 per
cent, are in fact carried out in the member states. De facto, surveillance
and control are shared between the member states and the Commission. Not
many people seem to know, however, that when the accounts are settled each
year the Commission disallows - that is, does not charge to the European
taxpayer - irregular payments. For 1989 accounts we disallowed Pounds 630m,
for 1990 accounts Pounds 770m and we expect to disallow a further
substantial sum for 1991.
The Audit Court has recently criticised some elements of financial
administration in the Commission. I will place a small bet that most
commentators have not read the 484 pages of the report, nor the Commission's
replies. I state emphatically that the Commission has no dispute with the
Audit Court. It is the court's duty to seek to improve financial management
and ours to respond. Where we think that it is right, we shall act and the
member states should do so too.
However, this has also been the open season for wild statements about fraud
in the Union. What we do know is that the effort against fraud and the rate
of detection have increased, both the European parliament and the Commission
giving this a high priority. What we do not know is whether fraud has
increased or decreased, although it is very likely that it is decreasing
because of the measures taken. In any event many of the figures quoted have
no basis in fact.
Finally, back to basics. It seems to be the time to emphasise that the
European Union:
has been the centrepiece of UK foreign and economic policy for very good
reasons since this community of friendly, democratic states has increased
prosperity for its member states while strictly respecting their national
diversity;
has certain competences strictly defined by the Treaty, which cannot be
changed except by unanimity;
has sharply reduced its legislative action, the volume of proposals put to
the Council and parliament having fallen like a stone since 1990 to a very
low level now;
is the world's biggest trader, providing the largest market for British
goods (Britain exports more to the Netherlands and Belgium than to the US);
is in a period of soundly-based growth, likely to outpace the US and Japan
in 1995 and 1996, though more action is needed on jobs;
has been a real force for liberalising western Europe for the free movement
of goods, services and capital to the benefit of the consumer and of
business, the internal market sweeping away tons of national red tape and
bureaucracy.
This is the picture in the looking glass.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Deceptive image of anonymity: Henning Schulte-Noelle,
Allianz chairman, explains the insurer's strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate might is not something about which senior executives at Allianz,
Europe's largest insurance company, like to boast. They chuckle at the
difficulty visitors have finding the group's Munich headquarters, with its
anonymous postwar facade and small nameplate.
But this public image is increasingly deceptive. The company recently paid
an estimated DM6.4bn (Dollars 4.1bn) to buy the direct insurance operations
of Swiss Re, the world's second-largest reinsurance company.
The deal will increase Allianz's premium income by about 20 per cent, from
DM65.5bn last year. It will also take the company within striking distance
of becoming the world's largest insurance company, toppling Nippon Life
which had premium income equivalent to about DM90bn last year.
For Allianz's 52-year-old chairman, Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle, the prospect
of global domination is not yet something to brag about. 'I haven't really
thought about that,' he says. 'It is not really a strategic objective.'
One reason may be that Allianz is likely to be forced by anti-trust
authorities to dispose of part of the Swiss Re package - the
Vereinte/Magdeburger insurance group. Half the latter's annual premium
income of about DM7bn comes from Germany's second largest private health
insurer, Vereinigte Kranken, and Allianz already has a majority holding in
the market leader, Deutsche Krankenversicherung.
Mr Schulte-Noelle expects a decision by the authorities 'pretty soon' but
says a forced disposal 'has been a possibility we have had to keep in mind
since the very beginning'. Both German and foreign companies have expressed
interest in buying Vereinte.
Another reason Allianz prefers not to boast about its size is that rapid
international growth in the past decade has left it with some headaches.
One is Fireman's Fund, the US insurer Allianz acquired four years ago for
Dollars 3.3bn which has performed below the industry average. Mr
Schulte-Noelle defends the purchase, made under his predecessor, Mr Wolfgang
Schieren. 'We feel that Fireman's Fund was a good buy for us. The results
have much improved over the years and the progress achieved would be even
more visible with a market turn.'
A second problem is Deutsche Versicherungs, the former state insurance
monopoly in east Germany that Allianz acquired in 1990. The acquisition has
so far cost the company DM2bn, and has yet to be profitable, despite rapid
premium increases and a substantial restructuring to turn the operation into
a modern insurance business.
Mr Schulte-Noelle expects Deutsche Versicherungs to move into profit in
1995, with a much reduced underwriting loss. However, the company has not
yet built up the investment portfolio needed to provide the sort of income
that bolsters results elsewhere in the group. In the long run, he expects to
prove that the east German venture has enhanced shareholder value.
When Mr Schulte-Noelle took over the top job at Allianz in 1991, premium
income had doubled in the previous five years. He admits there were good
reasons for calling a halt to further acquisitions to allow a period of
consolidation.
But, he says, Allianz could not ignore the opportunity offered by the Swiss
Re deal. The company had long wanted to expand in Switzerland. With Swiss
Re, it acquired insurance companies Elvia in Zurich and Lloyd Adriatico in
Italy, as well as Vereinte/Magdeburger.
The search for growth opportunities continues, says Mr Schulte-Noelle. He
wants to increase the company's share of the life market in the UK, where it
owns Cornhill Insurance. He is also targeting the emerging markets of Asia
and eastern Europe.
A forced disposal of Vereinte might be used to create other expansion
opportunities says Mr Schulte-Noelle. If it has to be sold, he will seek a
deal that fits with Allianz's long-term strategy - and not just maximise
sale proceeds. 'Price is of course the single most important criterion, but
it could also be of importance to us that the buyer of Vereinte may have to
offer something in terms of helping us in other markets.'
But the Allianz chairman dismisses suggestions that the company would
attempt to foil foreign companies entering the German market. Mr
Schulte-Noelle says Allianz has already taken steps to defend itself from
fiercer competition at home as the European Union deregulates the insurance
market.
Germany will be among those affected most by EU directives which since July
have allowed Europe's insurance companies to sell policies anywhere in the
Union on the basis of regulations in their home states. Local controls on
the wording of policies and on rates have also been removed.
In response, Allianz has reorganised the non-life side of its business into
divisions serving three consumer groups - personal customers, small and
medium-sized commercial business, and large industrial clients. The company
is also preparing to adapt its products rapidly in response to changing
demands. But Allianz is 'not going to play marketing gimmicks just for sake
of coming up with something new'.
For instance, Mr Schulte-Noelle does not expect unit trust-linked life
policies to become more popular, as in the UK. Germany's history, he says,
means most customers put caution to the fore. 'This may change because
private wealth built up after the war is now being transferred to a new
generation and people have more money to play with.'
But for all the preparations Allianz has made to hold on to its home market
share, Mr Schulte-Noelle does not foresee EU directives leading to a sudden
influx of products designed in other countries. 'I don't see any major
development of cross-border selling of personal lines because insurance
markets are essentially local markets. If you want to get a share of the
cake you have to be a local competitor.'
Similarly, he does not expect any immediate upset to traditional
distribution channels. Under the new EU rules, he expects to see no less
reliance on trained sales agents tied to selling Allianz products. 'There is
no authority any more checking products in advance and saying 'don't worry,
this is a product that we have looked into and which you can trust' . . .
Deregulation will rather strengthen the role of the captive sales
organisation, such as we have, in coming years.'
Thus Mr Schulte-Noelle does not expect direct telephone selling techniques,
pioneered in the UK by Royal Bank of Scotland's Direct Line, to make
substantial inroads into the German market. Soliciting customers by phone is
anyway forbidden by the German courts.
That should give Allianz the opportunity of build on the success it and
other German insurers have had in pushing up rates on motor and industrial
policies. As the spate of car thefts that so disrupted the motor sector in
recent years has become less alarming, underwriting results have been
boosted further.
In turn, an improved performance in the German market should help ameliorate
investors' fears about the short-term costs of an aggressive international
acquisition strategy. Although Allianz shares have performed below the
market average this year, Mr Schulte-Noelle says they have provided an
annual average post-tax return of 17 per cent over 10 years against 10 per
cent for the Dax index of leading shares listed in Frankfurt. To make the
shares more attractive for smaller investors, the company intends to divide
its shares - currently worth DM2,420 each, into smaller units.
There remain questions about the impact of Allianz's international strategy
on the value of its shares. 'There is a risk,' says Nomura Equity Research,
'that the Allianz earnings curve over the medium term will be
unspectacular.'
Last year, Allianz boosted pre-tax profits by 25 per cent to DM2bn, but this
year's performance has been more sedate. Mr Schulte-Noelle says total
underwriting losses this year will be below DM1bn after DM1.2bn in 1993.
Investment earnings will be affected by the downturn on bond markets.
Shareholders may thus take some comfort from the group's disinclination to
talk about becoming the world's biggest insurer. Mr Schulte-Noelle is
setting his sights on quality rather than size - 'the world's best, that is
the objective I would prefer'.

<TEXT>
The announcement yesterday by Trafalgar House, the conglomerate, that it may
bid for Northern Electric, one of the UK regional electricity companies
(recs), may mark the start of the biggest shake-up in electricity supply and
distribution since the 1990 privatisation. The bid partly reflects the
industry's growing financial health, and is likely to be followed by others.
But extensive consolidation will present regulators with tough problems as
they struggle to promote greater competition.
News of the possible bid has emerged as the industry enters a new lap of its
journey towards liberalisation. The government's 'golden share' in the 12
recs, preventing takeover, expires at the end of March. New price controls
will start to bite in April, and the market will be opened up to full
competition in 1998. Meanwhile Offer, the industry regulator, is trying to
increase competition in generation.
Despite all this uncertainty, Trafalgar House is right that there are
attractions in taking over a rec. Even after recent cost-cutting, there are
more jobs to be shed. If recs merge with each other - or with regional water
companies, another long-touted possible partnership - there could be large
savings in administration and billing. Bidders will also be attracted by the
recs' cash and future cash flow, although valuation is complicated by the
present uncertainty over the value of the National Grid, in which recs hold
shares.
It is less clear that Trafalgar House is the company to maximise the value
of a rec; its record is indifferent, and its new management team unproven in
its present configuration. The mooted bid, which may be partly motivated by
the desire to extract tax gains from combining the two companies, also
raises tough regulatory questions. Offer would be hard-pressed to ensure
that the rec's profits are adequately ring-fenced from Trafalgar House's
other activities. The regulator has already been forced to grapple with such
problems, as the recs have diversified beyond electricity supply and
distribution, but they would be compounded if a rec were subsumed within a
much larger group.
The bid would not, on its own, raise questions for competition policy. But
it sets the scene for a consolidation of the industry which could do so. The
recs enjoy, in essence, regional natural monopolies in electricity
distribution, while facing growing competition in supply from each other and
from new entrants, including generators. However, the industry is still a
long way from the regulator's dream of a fully competitive market in
electricity supply. While a degree of consolidation among suppliers would
not necessarily harm competition, such moves would need careful assessment
by competition authorities, to ensure that the benefits of privatisation and
liberalisation are not undermined.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Leading Article: India on trial
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Indians are not doomed to be poor. They are poor because of foolish
policies. Unfortunately, the likely response to the defeats suffered by the
Congress party in state elections will be precisely the wrong mixture of
caution with profligacy. The prime minister deserves credit for initiating
reform, but has failed to persuade the electorate of its benefits. Indeed he
has barely tried.
India's politics has become a struggle over the redistribution of poverty.
This can be seen in the resistance to reform of the labour market, in the
opposition to privatisation of public enterprises, in the continued pressure
for protection from imports, in the demands for affirmative action for
'backward' castes, in the failure to charge properly for electricity and
irrigation, in pressures for more public spending on food and fertiliser
subsidies and in the widespread exemptions from taxation.
The brilliantly executed response to India's economic crisis of 1991 offered
the country a chance to break out of the zero-sum trap into which politics
had led. Unfortunately, reform has not gone far or fast enough. In addition,
fiscal stabilisation more or less stopped after 1992-93. The fiscal deficit
is expected to be 6 per cent of gross domestic product this year and may
rise sharply again next year, in response to the electoral defeats. Yet even
this year's level is almost certainly unsustainable in the long run.
The pity of it all is that the reform agenda is beneficial to huge chunks of
the electorate. The elimination of controls has already reduced corruption
and, zealously pursued, could reduce it further. The beneficiaries of
industrial protection, over-employment in public enterprises and the failure
to allow plant closures are a small minority of the labour force. Equally,
trade liberalisation should favour agricultural output. While subsidised
power, water and fertilisers do benefit many farmers, the big gainers among
them are certainly not the rural poor.
The danger now is that reform will stand still, while fiscal stabilisation
starts to go backwards. If so, the economic momentum built up over the last
three years, though probably enough to produce growth at 5 or 6 per cent,
may well prove insufficient for anything more. It could even reverse. The
tragedy is that India desperately needs - and could achieve - an east Asian
level of economic performance.
While India was capable of fiscal stability, in the 1960s and 1970s, its
economy was shackled by controls. Now that controls are being lifted, it
cannot sustain fiscal stability. Worse, after these elections, Mr Rao's
instinct will be to go slow on reform and backslide on stabilisation. It is
a politically attractive strategy, but the wrong one. The only solid
platform for political success and even stability lies in the promise of a
better life for all. India's hope lies in the achievement of East Asian
growth, not in the false allure of Latin American populism.

Remember the South African Airways TV commercial which showed a passenger
giving birth prematurely? Apart from an attempt to symbolise the birth of
the new South Africa, delivered with the subtlety of a wildebeest skipping
down the aisle of a 747, the heroic air hostesses bring the young passenger
into the world without a drop of goo staining their impeccably pressed
uniforms.
Now TWA has set the record straight. On-board labour is a far messier
business - judging by an unscheduled arrival on a recent TWA flight from New
York to Orlando.
Fortunately, a doctor and two paramedics on the flight came to the rescue of
the cabin staff. Even so, they still needed a straw to clear fluid from the
baby's lungs and shoe-laces to tie the umbilical cord, according to TWA's
version of events.
However, when it comes to toe-curling sentimentality there is not much
difference between the new South Africa and TWA. The lucky parents honoured
the airport where TWA made an unscheduled landing by naming their child
Dulles. Pass the sick bag, please.

Know your beer - a venture capitalist's view. No doubt there are all sorts
of good financial reasons why Phil Goodwin, 3i's man in Manchester, is
putting Pounds 13m of equity into the Pounds 35.5m management buy-out of
Presspart from BTR.
But Goodwin's latest investment has also been guided by his taste buds.
Apparently, Presspart has cracked the secret of how to make the widget which
puts the fizz in beer cans out of metal rather than plastic.
Apart from making it easier to recycle empty cans, the all-metal device
functions at normal draught beer drinking temperatures so imbibers can taste
the hops better. 'I really don't like canned draught beer that's been
over-chilled in the fridge to make the widget work,' opines Goodwin. Nice to
find a venture capitalist who knows about more than champagne.

For sale: presidential palace, one previous elderly owner. Malawi's new
government is looking for someone to rent or buy one of Africa's most
remarkable follies - a 300-room palace, commissioned by the country's former
leader, Hastings Kamuzu Banda.
The erstwhile life president, whose autocratic style won him the nickname
'One Man Banda', will no longer be needing it - he was defeated earlier this
year in the country's first multi-party election since independence in 1964.
So New State House in the capital Lilongwe has been put on the market. It
'occupies a magnificent setting amongst vast beautiful landscaped (sic)
comprising immaculate grassed gardens complete with a summer pavilion,
terrazzo pavings and exotic flora', and comes with a banqueting hall capable
of seating 600 guests. All interested entrepreneurs are invited to write to
Box 30228, Lilongwe.
Sounds like a suitable retirement home for another elderly gentleman - the
one who used to run Lonrho.

Long live the beerage. Sir Paul Nicholson, the deer-stalking chairman of
Vaux, the Sunderland brewer and hotelier, has just become the third
generation of his family to chair the Brewers and Licensed Retailers
Association.
Grandfather was chairman of the association for six years in the 1920s and
1930s, and father for a year in the 1960s.
But despite his pedigree - Harrow, Cambridge and the Coldstream Guards  -
Sir Paul likes to give the impression that his family are strictly
tradespeople and not hereditary owners of what he likes to refer to as his
'booze and snooze business'. Bit hard to believe - given that he got the
chairman's job at 38 and has been doing it for nearly 20 years.
True, Sir Paul's grandfather started at Vaux as a humble accountant in 1896,
and the family now owns less than 1 per cent of the company. Then again when
grandad wanted to catch the night sleeper to London he could get it to halt
at the bottom of his drive.
Not even Sir Paul, the new president of the Northeast Chamber of Commerce,
can command that sort of service these days.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Beyond the Troubles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a danger that the success of this week's investment conference in
Northern Ireland will be measured in pounds and pence. The long list of aid
pledges recorded over the past few days are welcome injections to the
region, that will be easily spent. Yet the biggest obstacle to economic
success in Ulster has never been a shortage of public funds. Rather, it has
been a lack of confidence in the future, born of the Troubles, and shared by
residents and foreign investors alike. Overcoming that lack of faith would
be the true peace dividend. On that score alone, the conference may have
made a lasting contribution to the region's future.
Delegates heard much of the tax and other incentives aimed at attracting
inward investors to the province. But there are more fundamental attractions
to a peaceful Northern Ireland. Property prices are the lowest in the UK, as
are labour costs, and the workforce is well-educated. A few investors have
already begun to exploit these benefits. But there will need to be many more
if the economy is to rid itself of the distortions created by the last 25
years.
Economic activity is heavily skewed towards agriculture, declining
industries and the public sector. None of these offers a very promising
launch pad for peacetime growth. The prime minister, Mr John Major, has
rightly promised that security expenditure savings will not be lost to the
region altogether, but ploughed back into health and education spending.
Altering the composition of public spending to favour teachers and doctors
over policeman may create more public jobs than it destroys. Yet the
long-term aim of subsidies from the centre - currently around half of the
region's budget, or a quarter of GDP - must now be to give people a better
opportunity to fend for themselves in the private sector.
Over a third of the workforce is currently employed by the government. Even
this degree of public job creation has not prevented the region from having
the highest unemployment rate in the UK, with more than half of the total
being long-term unemployment. Joblessness afflicts Catholics particularly.
Some 43 per cent of 20- to 60-year-old Catholic men are currently without
work, compared with a 26 per cent non-employment rate among Protestants.
Mr Major announced further measures to tackle the problem in yesterday's
speech. But there is a strong case for doing more. Those at the periphery of
the UK have long resented being used as guinea pigs for potentially
unpopular new government policies. Using Northern Ireland as a testing
ground for ambitious employment policies which went beyond the timid
measures announced in last month's budget would make a welcome change. With
luck, enhanced inward investment flows, tighter transport and other links
with the south, and a better tourism trade will eventually provide jobs for
the unemployed to go to. This week's conference may make employers take a
look. The trick will be giving them the confidence to stay.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Time to know what you pay for

<TEXT>
The British government's defeat over VAT on domestic energy is of more than
just temporary political interest. For it brings to the surface how very
muddled the public is on the whole subject of spending and taxes. Opinion
poll after opinion poll shows that voters seem to want more publicly
provided, or financed, services. Yet they rear up against any attempts to
pay for these services by spreading the tax net more widely.
An idea of the public mood emerges from one poll in which nearly 50 per cent
replied that taxes on high incomes were too low, or 'much too low'. Only 6
per cent thought that taxes on middle incomes were too low and hardly anyone
thought that of taxes on low incomes. Yet the overwhelming majority of those
polled regarded themselves as either middle or low income. Less than 3 per
cent regarded themselves as receiving high incomes. On this evidence, there
are just too few rich to soak.
But the real drawbacks of allocating resources through competitive elections
rather than competitive markets go beyond these contradictions. They can be
summed up in the jargon phrase 'full line supply'. When a buyer makes
purchases in a supermarket, he or she can decide on how much he or she
wishes to spend and on what items. But when it comes to public goods like
defence, every citizen has to have the same amount. Worse than that: the
voter has to decide between two or three bundles of vague policies covering
all issues, none of which may express his or her preferences, but which he
or she has to take or leave as a whole.
Despite the drawbacks, some services are better financed collectively than
by relying on the private marketplace alone. One way of introducing a little
more coherence might be by some form of hypothecated or earmarked taxes,
designated for specific public services. There can, but need not, be a close
connection between the nature of the tax and the service for which it pays.
A historical example of an earmarked tax was 'Ship Money', levied on English
seaports and coastal regions to finance the Royal Navy. When Charles I
revived the tax in 1634-38, he started a chain of events which contributed
to the English civil war, his own beheading and a period of republican
government. But that was because the levies were extended to inland regions
and Parliament was not consulted. Earmarked taxes that are carefully and
sensitively applied may still be a lesser evil than today's habit of putting
all official revenues into a pool to be allocated at the government's
discretion.
Earmarked taxes have begun to receive support from different parts of the
political spectrum, for instance the UK left-of-centre think-tank, Demos,
and the free-market Institute for Economic Affairs. Hypothecated taxes are
already frequent in the US, where they are said to finance about half of
local spending. Many of the uses which Demos envisages for earmarking are
primarily local: for example, expenditure on the London Underground, city
nursery places, or a town's bid for the Olympics. For such applications to
work effectively in the UK, councils would have to acquire sources of
revenue sufficient to finance their own budgets.
Meanwhile, there is quite a lot than can be done at a national level.
Earmarked taxes cannot remove all the defects of state provision. They
cannot enable different voters to have different military budgets or
different sized health services to suit their individual preferences. But
they can at least make sure that the services come with a price tag and that
expenditure is representative of what the middle of the road taxpayer is
prepared to finance.
An example is public expenditure on health. This was running in the UK in
1993-94 (the last year for which a functional breakdown of public spending
was available) at almost Pounds 44bn - slightly more than the yield of VAT.
Why not then earmark the proceeds of VAT for the National Health Service and
let voters put their money where their mouths are? If they desire ever more
NHS expenditure, they should be ready to see the VAT rate creep up from 17
1/2 to 18, 19, 20 per cent and however much more it takes. Eventually even
the belligerent uniformed nurses who turn up at every televised election
brains trust with their demands for 'more, more, more' will begin to be
heard more critically.
Finance ministries have opposed hypothecated taxation mainly because it
reduces their own power. They can however call in aid well-known abuses of
hypothecation. There have been raids on supposedly hypothecated revenues.
The UK Road Fund used to be diverted to finance expenditure of no benefit to
motorists. The opposite distortion arises when general revenues are diverted
to top up hypothecated taxes. Until 1989 UK National Insurance contributions
were supplemented by an Exchequer contribution.
Another danger is tokenism, such as the extra 1p on the income tax which the
Liberal Democrats wanted to spend on education in the 1992 election. Without
having to bear a known tax for existing educational expenditure, voters are
not in a good position to judge whether they want to spend more or less.
The greatest obstacle to successful earmarking is inadequate public
knowledge. In most countries half or more of social security taxes are
levied on employers. Employees still have to pay in the end, as these taxes
are passed back in lower wages or passed forward in higher prices. As a
result, contributions cannot be used to put a price tag on increases in
social expenditure, such as pensions or sickness benefit.
Earmarking is indeed easier for indirect taxes on goods and services. But
some progress is still possible on the direct side. Income tax plus employee
national insurance contributions amounted in the UK in 1993-94 to nearly
Pounds 80bn. This was slightly less than the bill for social security. Why
not then earmark the whole of these personal tax receipts for a
Redistribution Fund from which all benefits, whether contributory or not,
would be paid? Gradually the gross totals of both tax and benefits could be
reduced as Inland Revenue computerisation allowed some optional netting off
in household taxes and benefits; and an approach could be made to a negative
income tax.
A study of earmarking by Margaret Wilkinson in the November issue of Fiscal
Studies* concludes that the snags are so great that earmarking is, except on
a very small scale, a snare and a delusion. She ends: 'Governments must
weigh the alternatives, and determine priorities with full knowledge of the
complexities that are involved, and then be accountable to the electorate
for them.' But it is precisely this unrealistic demand for omniscience by
governments which convinces some of us that there must be a better way.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Hard to catch a Eurostar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr CAROLINE JACKSON, MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your Business Travel section reported ('In time for Eurostar', December
12) that a passenger arriving less than 20 minutes before the departure of
the Eurostar train from Waterloo was barred access on the grounds that
security checks could not be carried out.
The arrangements surrounding the existing Eurostar service are so bizarre
and haphazard that I begin to wonder whether it is not being run by a group
of fifth columnists in the pay of the ferry companies. I arrived 10 minutes
before the Waterloo-Brussels departure the other day and was waved through
with no security checks on my baggage whatever. When I had phoned Eurostar
the previous day - with great difficulty because the line was constantly
engaged - I was told that the train was very full. In fact, it was virtually
empty, both ways.
Meanwhile, at the Gare du Midi in Brussels, the Belgians still insist on
static passport checks and their station is like an unfinished morgue.
Getting a ticket at all in the UK requires reserves of perseverance. Not
everybody, especially business travellers, can plan weeks or even days in
advance. I tried for a ticket for the next day's Eurostar at Swindon and
Didcot, both important London feeder stations, and was told that they could
not sell me one because they did not have the necessary computer equipment.
At Didcot they believe that it will be two years before they get it. I was
advised to try Reading, Bath or Bristol.
I have just rung Eurostar again - to get a recorded announcement that the
office is closed because of a fire drill. No alternative arrangement for
booking tickets seems to be in place.
Do they want passengers at all?

FT  15 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Monetary framework needs more clarity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MALCOLM BRUCE MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I very much welcome the call in your leader article (December 13) for a
new target range for UK inflation. Indeed I made a similar proposal in our
party's alternative Budget two weeks ago, suggesting that the inflation
target be reduced to 0-3 per cent.
The present inflation target is something of a muddle, with a target rage of
1-2.5 per cent within a broader target of 1-4 per cent. There is now a need
to reinforce the credibility of the monetary framework by making the
inflation target clearer and singular, and by addressing some of the other
defects which you identify. This includes the narrowness of the 1-2.5 per
cent range, which is in practical and operational terms far too restrictive.
Additionally, there is no explicit target beyond 1997, though the Bank of
England is apparently working on an assumption of 0-2 per cent. This is a
significant weakness given that monetary policy works with long lags, so
that it is vital to know well in advance where one is steering for. As you
note, it is also particularly important to make the inflation targets clear
beyond 1997, as this will cover the post-election period, possibly with a
non-Conservative government in office. This would be absolutely the wrong
time to have any confusion about the nature of the UK's commitment to low
inflation.
I believe that the introduction of inflation targets has been a promising
evolution in UK monetary policy. There is now a need, however, to make the
monetary framework clearer and less open to future abuse and confusion.
This should serve, as you suggest, to build a cross-party consensus around
low inflation, which could not only reduce the price of long-term British
government borrowing, but could lock the UK into permanently low levels of
inflation.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Current dividend trend has damaging
effects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTIN SIMONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The extraordinary rise in dividends declared by UK electricity
generators and distributors, coupled with buy-backs of shares 'which enhance
returns for shareholders' (Company News, This Week: 'Buy-backs set to
enhance returns for shareholders', December 12) is a national disgrace.
The necessary profits and cash flows for the distribution bonanza have been,
and continue to be, generated by duopoly suppliers using their muscle by
overcharging private and industrial customers. The latter suffer from
unnecessary cost pressure which inhibits investment and job creation.
The electricity industry continues to shed labour and past inefficiencies
are now used to justify electrifying pay increases for directors. When will
some influential spark realise that short-term electricity profit
optimisation is doing immense damage, especially to energy-intensive sectors
such as chemicals, glass, cement and heavy engineering?
Are French, German and Japanese electricity companies paying such high
dividends and buying back shares? No, because they have some sense, not
least for the common weal.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rise in duty no answer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HUGH MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Many commentators and City opinion-formers seem to have welcomed the
chancellor's decision to raise excise duties on spirits and other products,
on the grounds that this would close the gap left in his Budget by the vote
against raising VAT on fuel from 8 to 17.5 per cent.
The evidence of the past few years suggests, however, that Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, will fail in his objective; in the last year that followed
an increase in excise duty (1992-93) the chancellor's receipts from excise
duty on spirits fell by Pounds 80m. In the following year, after Mr Clarke
and his predecessor had frozen the rate of duty on spirits, Treasury
receipts actually grew by Pounds 46m.
This clear evidence of diminishing returns points to the likelihood that
last week's 4 per cent rise will once again lead to a drop in revenue
receipts.
Not only will the chancellor's action damage an important UK industry; not
only will it weaken the industry's attempts to overcome discriminatory tax
treatment in Europe and beyond; he has done all this in a desperate attempt
to raise revenue which will not materialise.
The chancellor will find that this particular crock of gold is at the end of
a very distant rainbow.

Sir, Lord Plumb is right (Letters, December 8) when, commenting on a survey
of the attitudes to the European Union in the UK and Germany, he says that
how questions are framed in polls on the EU can affect the result. However,
this usually works for, not against, the EU lobby.
Several countries would not be in the association if referendum questions
had been worded with Yes for staying out and No for going in. Pro-Union
politicians are quick enough to use what he calls 'popular bewilderment'
when it suits them.
Confused voters choosing the friendly, positive-sounding Yes are called bold
and intelligent when they vote for the in-stitution that gives Lord Plumb
purpose, the European Union.

The Coming End of Canada and the Stakes for America
By Lansing Lamont
WW Norton and Co, Pounds 19.95/Dollars 29.99, 267 pages
So you thought that Canada was a stable, peaceful place where civility and
compromise were the order of the day? Think again, advises Mr Lansing
Lamont.
In this provocative book, Mr Lamont raises the spectre of bloody riots on
the streets of Montreal, disaffected aboriginals blowing up one of North
America's biggest hydro-electric projects, and Quebec gunboats intercepting
US tankers on the St Lawrence River - all within the next seven or eight
years.
The unrest would be the precursor to the ineluctable disintegration of the
world's second biggest country. Much of what is now English-speaking Canada
would end up as part of the US, leaving a newly-independent Quebec as a
lonely - and increasingly impoverished - outpost of French language and
culture.
Mr Lamont, a former correspondent for Time magazine and a frequent visitor
to Canada, suggests that foreigners have for too long looked at Canada from
the wrong angle.
Instead of puzzling over why such a nation apparently blessed with such rich
natural and human resources should want to tear itself apart, the real
question is how Canada has managed to stay in one piece for 127 years.
Mr Lamont says the chasm between Canada's French and English is as deep as
between Ireland's Catholics and Protestants. But he identifies many other
tensions that threaten to tear apart the national fabric.
The 5m inhabitants of the prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and
Manitoba 'carry on their shoulders a chip the size of Labrador. They have
all the goodies, but somehow the benefits always seem to land in the laps of
rapacious easterners.'
The 10 provinces are forever trying to wrest powers from the federal
government in Ottawa. Aboriginal communities have become increasingly
militant.
The pervasive influence of US television is weakening Canada's fragile
indigenous culture. Meanwhile, immigrant groups are encouraged by a policy
of 'multi-culturalism' to make the preservation of their own identities a
higher priority than a united country.
Economic forces are also melting the glue that has held Canada together. The
1989 free trade agreement with the US has focused Canadian business on
markets and competitors to the south - a trend exacerbated by internal trade
barriers between the provinces.
Towering debt and budget deficits channel a growing proportion of government
revenues to foreign creditors, limiting the ability of Ottawa and the
provinces to meet their own citizens' demands.
'At its birth as a British dominion in 1867,' Mr Lamont concludes, 'Canada's
existence was predicated on its fear of annexation by the United States; its
pride and security in belonging to the mightiest empire since Rome's; and
the need for a protected economy to ward off its omnipotent southern
neighbour. As none of these reasons apply any longer, and having no new
ideological underpinnings to help validate its national purpose, Canada is
becoming increasingly vulnerable to fissure.'
In the second section of Breakup, Mr Lamont makes 'an informed surmise of
what could happen in the worst circumstances' as the fissures widen. He
postulates a last-ditch National Commission to Rebuild Canada in 1996, the
failure of which leads to Quebec's stormy unilateral declaration of
independence four years later. The four Atlantic provinces, cut off from the
rest of Canada by the secession, would have little choice but to seek a
future with the US. The much richer western provinces would also tighten
their already-close links with the US north west.
Mr Lamont's disquieting scenario may well come to pass. The success of
regional parties from Quebec and western Canada in last year's general
election is a reminder that the centre is an unrewarding place to be in
politics when grievances fill the air.
Quebeckers elected a separatist government in September. Earlier this month,
it unveiled plans to draw up a new constitution early in the New Year as a
prelude to an independence referendum. The province's aboriginal communities
have vowed to resist the drive towards sovereignty. Many western Canadians
wish Quebec good riddance. Can it be long before even hotter heads come to
the fore?
Don't write Canada off just yet. Mr Lamont researched much of his book at a
time when, even by recent Canadian standards, the national mood was
unusually grumpy.
The recession was at its deepest. Voters had rejected the Charlottetown
Accord, an effort by politicians to write a constitution that would
accommodate the demands of Quebec as well as, in Mr Lamont's words, every
other special interest group except left-handed dentists.
Although almost every page of Mr Lamont's book contains a good reason for
Canada to break up, it also gives some cause for hope.
He notes, for instance, that Quebeckers are 'still essentially a cautious
people used to walking on ice in winter. That . . . suggests that they will
not make the final leap to independence.' Recent opinion polls indicate that
only about 40 per cent of Quebeckers support independence.
The economy is enjoying a robust recovery and the mood in the country at
large has mellowed appreciably since Mr Jean Chretien's Liberals took office
just over a year ago.
Moreover, for all their complaints, most Canadians would rather see their
country survive than be shattered apart or absorbed by their southern
neighbour. It is still possible that Canada will muddle through in a
typically Canadian way - not united but also not irrevocably split.

What is the difference between entertaining eccentricity and tunnel-vision
tedium? Compare tonight's Spirit of Trees at 8.30 on Channel 4 with Witness:
Why East Grinstead? that immediately follows it. In the first, experts drone
on about what could be a beautiful and important topic; in the second the
trivial and dotty are made fascinating. At least in East Grinstead they hug
their trees.
They also caress rocks and dowse all over the place. Suburbia took a bashing
on television earlier this year; this redresses the balance. But not all
suburbs are like East Grinstead. The phenomenon is peculiar: a high
concentration of faddists, sects and genuinely religious in the county that
logically enough gave us Puck of Pook's Hill. A treasurable half-hour of the
gently barking. The preceding tree programme is all bark and no bite.
Communal nuttiness also surfaces in The Vicar of Dibley (8.30 BBC1), the
sitcom about a clergywoman. Fans compare it with Dad's Army but it lacks the
authentic human characteristics of Warmington's Home Guard.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Arts: Andras Schiff - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Sunday, Andras Schiff played Bach, Bartok and Beethoven at the Barbican -
in that order. The second half was reserved for the 'Hammerklavier' Sonata;
earlier, Bartok's piano sonata snapped at the heels of Bach's Fourth
Partita.
The Partita was exquisitely performed. I used to find Schiff's Bach
over-jewelled sometimes, but nowadays he strikes a lovely balance between
grace and rigorous clarity. His Overture here was resplendent, the Aria
deeply meditated, the final Gigue a dazzling tour de force: altogether a
delight to hear.
With Schiff the dance-movements in the Partitas sound more like contrapuntal
character-pieces, individuated by expression rather than by strongly
contrasted rhythms. At the risk of gilding the lily, I think he might
remember the dance a little more often. In the Bartok sonata there was no
sense of a stamping-dance in the first movement, nor much popular lilt in
the last. Schiff's keyboard style in Bach (digital, linear, parsimonious
with the pedal) was carried over to Bartok, and the result - in a piece
partly inspired by Stravinsky's Rite - felt brittle and bloodless, fleet
without thrust.
In the grand first movement of the 'Hammerklavier', it seemed that the
breadth of Schiff's musical intelligence again risked compromise by light
fingers and a hint of nervy tautness. By the Adagio, however, he had found
his best stride: still light and under-pedalled, but soberly penetrating and
perfectly sustained. The audience was held rapt. The concluding fugue, much
of it taken at heroically reckless speed, was cogent and triumphant.

<TEXT>
PRINCESS CARABOO (PG) Michael Austin
NEVER ENDING STORY III (U) Peter MacDonald
THE PAGEMASTER (PG) Joe Johnstone and Maurice Hunt
THE NUTCRACKER (U) Emile Ardolino
CHASING THE DEER (PG) Graham Holloway
ONLY THE STRONG (15) Sheldon Lettich
Princess Caraboo, the tale of a beautiful vagrant girl (Phoebe Cates) who is
adopted by early 19th century English high society in the belief that she is
a foreign princess, shows that people will believe anything if it comes in a
charismatic wrapping.
They may even believe that this medium-jolly if maddeningly erratic movie is
based on a real story. So contends co-screenwriter John Wells. But I have
been to that well before, or tumbled down it. As a humble theatre reviewer I
once fell for Wells's claim that his play The Projector (Stratford East,
1970s) was an authentic 'lost' 18th century comedy. Result: egg on my face
and the near-termination of a promising critical career.
Let us just say that even if Caraboo is true it cannot have been true like
this. English society never consisted, we hazard, of Jim Broadbent and Wendy
Hughes living, however entertainingly, in manor'd wealth with a set of
strange furniture (seashell-upholstered settees a speciality) and a Greek
butler portrayed with tortured vowel sounds and expressive moustache by
Kevin Kline (very funny).
No ill-nourished vagrant ever looked like Phoebe Cates (aka Mrs Kline), who
resembles a well-fed graduate of Hollywood High School seeking further
doughnuts. And no surviving picture of the Prince Regent suggests that he
resembled John Sessions wearing Mikado cast-offs. Sessions's look of camp,
gobstopper-cheeked naughtiness also comes closer than ever before to
suggesting he may be the illegitimate son of Freddie Jones.
The movie trips along with its strange, rambling comic gait, never quite
adding up to the sum of its parts, fruitily though these are played. Add
Stephen Rea (lovestruck journo), the Reverend John Wells (more gobstopper
cheeks) and Professor John Lithgow, English-accented again after A Good Man
In Africa, and you have a surging roster of multi-style talent seeking a
central meeting place. But director/co-writer Michael Austin stands around
like a dazed traffic policeman. Moods collide (satire, farce, mystery,
romance); characters honk and criss-cross; and if there was ever a true
story behind Caraboo, its bones are slowly broken under the weight of
incidental traffic.
We expect what Mark Twain would call 'stretchers' at Christmas time. This is
the season when we gather round the fire to listen to tall tales and to be
struck about the head by flying chestnuts.
The Pagemaster and Never Ending Story III are variations on the same
chestnut. A little boy is hurled into make-believe land, where a dose of
educative fantasy strengthens him for the real-life battles back home. Alas,
the fantasy scenarios in both films are dull enough to put the hero into a
coma before he even contemplates the return journey.
In The Pagemaster Macaulay Culkin falls and knocks his head on a library's
marble floor, thereby precipitating dreams about animated books. The voices
of Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stewart, Leonard Nimoy and others prattle behind
the dancing vellum-bound shapes as Culkin lives through cartoon digests of
Moby Dick, Treasure Island, Dr Jekyll And Mr Hyde and Gulliver's Travels.
These are witlessly slogged through in a 66-minute film that seems like 66
hours.
Culkin himself is showing grave signs of wear. Since Home Alone the boy has
acted like a dazed demi-angel who has lost radio contact with Planet Earth.
The instant-access mugging that had such charm in HA - 'Macaulay, smile',
'Macaulay, scream,' 'Macaulay, hit the burglars]' - has lost its verve. We
know that Master C could never actually 'act'. But now he seems to have lost
that peerless in-born talent, so post-modern in one so pre-pubescent, for
parodying acting.
Another boy thespian adrift in imaginative hyper-space is Jason James
Richter in The Never Ending Story III. What to say about a movie with tedium
sewn into its very title? Young Bastien, our hero, is now a Los Angeles
schoolboy apparently living on the same doughnut diet as Phoebe Cates.
Persecuted by bullies, the plump-cheeked lad takes refuge in a library,
where on opening the eponymous folklore tome he is magicked back into the
land of 'Fantasia'. Luck-dragons; princesses; Tony Robinson as a gnome; and
mile on mile of Christmas grotto decor.
We would like to say that all plot resemblances between this film and The
Pagemaster are coincidental. Perhaps so. But the shared library settings
hint at a Western cinema suddenly becoming alarmingly pedagogic about
reading. Note the posters of famous film stars urging 'Read' on the walls of
the Never-Ending library and the parade of nudging book titles on the
shelves of The Pagemaster.
But Hollywood never quite manages to heave itself up into high culture.
Among the books flaunting their spines at Master Culkin are Ten Little
Indians and The Haunting: giveaway-lowbrow titles, which also happen to be
the titles by which the movies not the novels were known. Popular cinema may
be making one of its periodic bids to turn from poacher to gamekeeper, but
apparently it can still only recognise stolen game.
In a week of bizarre cross-referencing, all we need now is another film
starring Master Culkin, hinting at Hollywood's affair with high culture and
containing a plot poised between fantasy and reality.
Abracadabra: The Nutcracker. George Balanchine's version of the Tchaikovsky
ballet has been filmed, with Macaulay as Drosselmeyer's nephew. This riot of
sound and colour, directed by Emile Ardolino (Dirty Dancing), was created
some time ago. This explains why Culkin is in angelic prime, capering
through his role with all the hammy wonder he brought to Home Alone. (He
actually was a ballet student before being captured by Tinseltown).
Lovely sets; luscious music; worth a Christmas outing. We wish we could
speak thus of Chasing The Deer. The good news is that this British film was
heroically financed by small investors: a literal army of them, who having
handed over their wallets then kitted themselves out in 1740s battle dress
to play extras in Graham Holloway's mini-epic about the Jacobite wars.
Now the bad news. The combat scenes play like one of those Monty Python
battle sketches in which obscure women's guilds, having selected a patch of
mud, used to hit each other over the head with handbags. Between battles,
the screen is cleared for the actors to stand in uncertain lighting mouthing
self-destruct dialogue. (Sample conversation-stopper: 'Then there is the
episcopalian dimension . . . ') Ten points for financial initiative; one and
a half for creative result.
Only The Strong will appeal to only the barmy. Ninety minutes of the
Brazilian martial art called capoeira, which to the untrained eye looks like
breakdancing with violence. Sheldon Lettich directs. Someone called Mark
Dacascos stars. Avoid.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Arts: Tony Kushner's 'Slavs]' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not only does the playwright Tony Kushner take on the most difficult themes
of the era we live in, he also links them together. In his new 90-minute
Slavs] (Thinking About the Longstanding Problems of Virtue and Happiness),
as in his widely-acclaimed two-part Angels in America, he somehow yokes the
collapse of Soviet communism to the new prominence of homosexuality and a
great deal else besides. And he manages to show the full seriousness of the
situation he is presenting while relieving it with humour and a range of
different characters. The sheer scope of his ambition is refreshing.
Yet to my mind Kushner is a lightweight. For all its massive historical,
political, socio-economic, psychosexual and metaphysical range, I never felt
that Angels in America was any larger in spirit than a soap opera, albeit
vivid and touching and entertaining. (My reaction did not change even when I
had seen productions on both sides of the Atlantic).
Slavs] is not soap-opera but satire. It does not flit between disparate
narrative threads, as did Angels in America, and it has a less gossipy
concern with what will happen next to whom. But here again his characters
have both the vitality and the shallowness of cartoons, and here again he
interconnects them in a way that rings hollow. We see that he has assembled
them to illustrate strategically the contrasting symptoms of the State of
Things Today.
Thus the alcoholic and nihilistic Katherina Sesafina Gleb, a warden of the
Pan-Soviet archive (guarding the bottled brains of Lenin and other
ex-comrades) in 1985 (Act Two), is here the lesbian girlfriend of socialist
Doctor Bonfila Bezhukhovna Bonch-Bruevich, who in 1992 (Act Three) reveals
the disastrous medical effects of Russian nuclear and chemical pollution
upon Siberia and elsewhere. Lesbians, alcoholism, Leninism, socialism,
pollution, medicine, the past, the future: yes, what a nexus] And how
perverse that, for all the vehemence Kushner gives these characters, he
cannot give either of them much substance.
Slavs] begins with the kind of hilarious stroke that we expect to find not
in a play but in TV satire. Two Muscovite street-cleaners - brushing away
the snow as they talk - are talking to each other, in lengthy and perfect
sentences, of what political conclusions to draw from studying history from
Marx and Engels. Peculiar, however, is the way Kushner keeps this joke going
throughout the play.
It would be hard to make a better case for this British premiere of the play
than is being made at the Hampstead Theatre, where Matthew Lloyd directs a
generally superb cast. Design, by Ultz, is economical and effective. Lloyd
keeps Kushner's satiric tone keenly to the fore while stressing humanity
where he can.
Imelda Staunton's performance is more real than the words she speaks. She
shows us the quiet, caring, troubled mind and nervous system of the lesbian
Doctor Bonch-Bruevich. A wonderful actress. Annette Badland is just as fine
as Mrs Shastlivyi Domik, blasting with great sincerity through an oration
that starts forcefully and climbs in intensity from there.
Paul Jesson is excellent as Ippolite Ippopolitovich Popolitipov, a Soviet
official who has the misfortune to be in love with the same woman as Dr
Bonch-Bruevich. Peter Copley and Richard Mayes are first-rate as Aleksii
Antedilluvianovich Prelapsarianov (the world's oldest Bolshevik) and Serge
Esmereldovich Upgobkin. Ron Cook has to play Yegor Tremens Rodent, the kind
of weak character whom Kushner needs in his plays so that every more
right-thinking character can worst him in argument. Only Aisling O'Sullivan
lets the side down as the alcoholic lesbian Katherina Gleb. Presence and
force, sure, but no coherent detail. (I never believed in her alcoholism.) A
cast like this should reach the West End; a play like Slavs] should not.
At the Hampstead Theatre, NW3.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Arts: Arts Council bales out the beleaguered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lower ticket prices for performances of contemporary opera at Covent Garden;
financial life-lines for the beleaguered regional orchestras and theatres;
more English touring by the National Theatre and the RSC; and no grant for
KOSH, the dance company: these are the main decisions from the Arts Council
of England yesterday as it announced the carve up of its 1995-96 grant.
The council unexpectedly received an extra Pounds 5.1m in the Budget, a rise
of 2.75 per cent to Pounds 191.1m. It had been told to plan on standstill
funding and had passed the same message to its clients. In the event, that
is just what the majority of grant-aided arts companies can expect next
year: frozen subsidy. The additional money has been used to ensure that few,
if any, companies go under before lottery funding starts to come through in
April.
The five regional orchestras and 16 theatres, including those in Farnham,
Birmingham, Salisbury, Harrogate and Cheltenham, were facing worryingly high
deficits. The council has decided to give the orchestras an additional
Pounds 450,000 between them (on condition that they match this sum by their
own efforts) while the theatres will share Pounds 565,000. The money comes
with the understanding that they must sort themselves out financially once
and for all.
Some national companies have been given special treatment. Hard pressed ENO
is getting Pounds 300,000 more, at Pounds 11.955m, to invest in new
productions, while Opera North is baled out with Pounds 200,000 more, to
Pounds 4.834m. English National Ballet is near breaking point and has had
its grant raised by Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 3.9m while Northern Ballet
Theatre gets Pounds 125,000 extra at Pounds 1.225m.
High seat prices at Covent Garden are a perpetual worry. The council cannot
afford to increase its across the board subsidy but is advancing another
Pounds 300,000, making Pounds 8.8m, to ensure that the Royal Opera can
reduce prices to help fill seats for contemporary opera.
The London orchestras face a difficult future: two, the LSO and the LPO, are
on frozen grants while the RPO and the Philharmonia must make do with just
Pounds 20,000 more each to help their regional work in Nottingham and
Bedford. The KOSH loses its grant for artistic reasons, but can apply for
touring money. In contrast DV8, the Place and Dance Umbrella get sizeable
lifts in subsidy, while Royal Ballet receives Pounds 100,000 more, at just
over Pounds 6m, to be invested in choreography.
The secretary general of the council, Mary Allen, said yesterday 'I
sincerely hope that no one now goes to the wall.' Prior consultation
suggests that most companies are happy. And with the council lottery fund
growing to Pounds 9m in just three weeks, the assumption is that any arts
company in a parlous state will have put in a well argued bid for some of
this cash.

FT  15 DEC 94 / Technology: Cargo vessels take to the air - A group of
ship-builders in Japan is focusing on speed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PATTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sea transport gave way decades ago to roads, rail and air as the fastest way
to move goods around the world. However, a consortium of Japanese ship
builders is developing a high-speed cargo ship that may bring sea transport
back into fashion.
The seven-company consortium, Technological Research Association of
Techno-Superliner, has been working on the ship since 1989. The goal is to
make the transport of time-sensitive goods by sea a serious alternative to
road,
rail and air.
The techno-superliner, with a cruising range of about 930km, will carry
1,000 tonnes of cargo over, rather than through, the waves at speeds of at
least 50 knots. This compares with 35.5 knots achieved in a trial run
earlier this month by a car ferry, and the previous 30.5 knots record held
by a Finnish vessel.
The developers are testing designs that lift the hull out of the water,
reducing water resistance. Propulsion and steering systems will use movable
water jets since there will be no conventional hull to support propeller and
rudder.
The consortium, which includes Mitsubishi, Kawasaki and Sumitomo, is testing
two designs that lift the hull: the hydrofoil and the air cushion. The
hydrofoil uses the same principle that keeps conventional aircraft aloft.
'Wings' beneath the water's surface produce lift which keeps most of the
craft out of the water and free of its resistance to motion.
The air cushion type uses large fans to create a 'cushion' of air under the
ship. The hull shape includes skirts that surround the air cushion and
contain it. The result is that the craft skims over the air cushion instead
of ploughing through the water like conventional cargo ships.
Neither of the designs is new, but they have not been used successfully to
build vessels as large and as stable as the techno-superliner will have to
be.
Experimental vessels of both types have been built and have been in sea
trials since July. The Hayate (Japanese for 'swift wind') is the hydrofoil
version. A one-sixth size scale version has reached speeds of 41kph in
tests. But the most advanced model is the air cushion ship Hisho (meaning
'flight').
The 70m Hisho, built to approximately half-scale, has recorded speeds up to
54 knots. The captain and crew reported good manoeuvrability and
seaworthiness in high waves. Hisho, they say, can safely weather 3m waves.
In sea trials between July and September, the air-cushion ship was put
through its paces off the coast of the Goto islands in Nagasaki prefecture
and since then has sailed the length of the Japanese archipelago. Although
the experimental vessel is not equipped for cargo handling, the weight of
cargo is simulated using a centrally located water tank.
In two test runs, with cargoes of 100 and 200 tonnes, the experimental ship
attained 50 knots. Next year, Hisho will be used to conduct safety trials.
The vessel will move goods in 12 hours or less from Tokyo to Hokkaido in the
north or Kyushu in the south or even to neighbouring Asian countries in just
a day or two, the developers say.
The companies have spent Y75bn (Pounds 475m) on the techno-superliner
project over the past six years, but about double that amount will be needed
to build a full-scale, 127m version of Hisho. That is twice the cost of a
conventional ferry of the same size.
Fuel consumption is 10 times that of conventional, slower craft and Hisho
requires special cargo handling equipment to minimise the time spent in
port. But once those problems have been solved, Hisho's 200,000 hp engines
will power a cargo ship capable of carrying 100, 10-tonne, 20m cargo
containers to and from any port in or near Japan.

had been fragile since a stroke in 1974.
He spent his career at Edge &amp; Ellison, solicitors, finishing as senior
partner having helped to build the firm up into one of the leading regional
legal practices. But at the same time he was in demand as a company
director.
He served with quoted companies like Forward Group, Hampson Industries and
Metalrax and unquoted companies like JW Norton Services, Saville Barkers
Newsagents and Turbine Blading Group. As a chairman he specialised in
chatty, idiosyncratic statements.
