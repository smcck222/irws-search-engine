Changes to the Financial Times files.


1. Since the files did not contain any document numbers, document numbers were 
   added in the format of: FT911-1, where FT stands for Financial Times; 91 
   represents the year, the first 1 comes from numbering on the original 
   disks, and the final 1 is a sequential number added at NIST.  

2. All punctuation was changed to be SGML compliant.  This was most obvious in 
   the case of '&'.  In addition, control characters were removed from the 
   documents or replaced with the appropriate SGML entity.  For a detailed 
   list of the entities handled by sgml, see the file ftdtd.  

3. One tag was shortened from PUBLICATION to <PUB>.  The END tag was deleted. 

4. In the original data for ft921, there were several files that began with 
   "!"; these files were not used.

5. In the original data for ft922, a table contained numerous ^? (which is 
   really a *).  These characters were deleted since they did not parse 
   through the sgml filter.
