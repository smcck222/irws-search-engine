NEW FALLOUT FROM CHERNOBYL; 
</P>
<P>
THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF THE CHERNOBYL DISASTER BY DAVID R. MARPLES (ST. MARTIN'S 
PRESS: $35, CLOTH; $14.95, PAPER; 316 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-312-02432-0)

By James E. Oberg , Oberg, a space engineer in Houston, is the author of 
Uncovering Soviet Disasters: Exploring the Limits of Glasnost (Random House). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The onset of the new Gorbachev policy of glasnost, commonly mistranslated as 
openness but closer in connotation to candor or publicizing, has complicated 
the task of Soviet secret-keepers and has allowed substantial new Western 
insights into Soviet society. David R. Marples' new book, his second on the 
Chernobyl accident of April 26, 1986, is a shining example of the best type of 
non-Soviet analysis into topics that only recently were absolutely taboo in 
Moscow official circles. 
</P>
<P>
The author, a British-educated historian and economist, is a research associate 
with the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies at the University of Alberta, 
and the academic style of the book is undisguised. However, its intended 
audience is the general public, and anyone interested in nuclear power, or 
Soviet economy and society, or human drama, or just plain sleuthing state 
secrets, will find hitherto unpublished revelations and explanations of the 
event and its continuing aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
The effects of Chernobyl reverberated throughout so many facets of Soviet 
society that a continuous coherent narrative is probably impossible. Marples 
discusses half a dozen major themes arranged in a fairly arbitrary order (as 
indicated by the frequent and helpful cross references throughout the text) and 
succeeds in mapping out his main themes. The personal interests of each reader 
determine which of the sections may be deemed too detailed and which too 
sketchy, but considering the need for such a comprehensive overview, the levels 
are generally appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
The book is, on the one hand, not a light read, and an executive summary might 
have been possible in a quarter the length. But, on the other, so many of the 
judgments depend on a subtle interpretation of a multitude of sources that the 
author is obligated to present the raw data for the reader's inspection. The 
modular nature of the book also allows a reader to skip, browse, and revisit 
earlier sections, aided by a convenient internal organization and a thorough 
index. 
</P>
<P>
First in the world's attention, and in the text, is a discussion of the human 
victims of the accident. The official tally is 31 (only about 20 names have 
ever been released), but Marples suspects there were other short-term radiation 
victims. A large number of unnecessary late-term abortions were also performed 
on local women, and by rights those unborn babies count as casualties. 
Widespread "radiophobia" led to restricted diets which created malnourishment 
and subsequent disease in thousands of people. The tens of thousands of people 
taking part in cleanup operations were never included in official totals of 
those exposed. Since the book went to press, Soviet military sources have 
referred to at least one death in the actual reactor entombment program. 
</P>
<P>
But the greatest toll is likely to occur with the delayed deaths. Here, Marples 
encounters for the first time the soon familiar theme of official Soviet 
myth-making around the event: Reality is twisted to serve state policy 
objectives, which include calming an alarmed public with assurances that all is 
well when it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
And thus is born what he properly labels the "myth of Chernobyl," the official 
line that the disaster provided a test that Soviet society passed with honor. 
"In the Soviet view," he writes, "it was first and foremost a victory, a story 
with an ending, and an ending that was triumphant." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when sober Western medical estimates placed the future "excess cancer 
deaths" at several tens of thousands, both in the Soviet Union and in Europe (a 
few tenths of a percent elevation of the natural cancer rate), the Soviets 
reacted furiously. The estimates are branded "nonsense" and the estimators are 
dismissed as "panic mongers" promulgating "anti-Soviet venom." 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently the author addresses themes of environmental impact, economic and 
political repercussions, public images, and the recovery operations. Along the 
way, Marples provides a damning list of examples in which Soviet officials 
attempted to retreat behind old-style cover-ups and outright lies. False 
information was issued on radiation levels, on subsequent accidents at the 
site, on contamination levels of the Kiev water supply, on severe discipline 
against non-volunteer cleanup personnel, on reactor entombment schedules and on 
operator training levels. 
</P>
<P>
A severe 1986-1987 countrywide electrical power shortage was officially denied 
although it was real enough to compel the restart of three Chernobyl reactors 
in explicit violation of Soviet safety regulations. Design deficiencies of the 
Chernobyl-style reactors were downplayed and human errors were declared to be 
the primary culprit. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, observes the author, "It is ironic that in an era of openness, 
Chernobyl may have been both the pioneer of glasnost under Gorbachev and then 
subsequently its first casualty." He ultimately concludes, "Aspects of the 
disaster . . . have rarely been dealt with thoroughly or even honestly by 
Soviet sources." Hence the need for this book, a need which is admirably 
fulfilled despite the many remaining mysteries and uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
The July, 1987, trial of reactor personnel marked a full circle of disclosure. 
Journalists were allowed into the pre-scripted first and last days, but the 
weeklong deliberative sessions were held in secret and no word of their 
substance has ever been released. 
</P>
<P>
The propaganda purpose of the trial and surrounding official publicity, he 
maintains, had one goal: "To divert culpability from the party hierarchy, in 
Kiev and especially in Moscow." This is precisely the theme I have also 
encountered in my own investigations of aerospace accidents of the past. Where 
individual human failings led to catastrophe, a sanitized story may eventually 
be released, but where Kremlin policy led to disaster (such as the Nedelin 
catastrophe of 1960 or the Soyuz-1 disaster in 1967), the entire event remains 
absolutely off limits to glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
The closing blow-by-blow description of the nuclear power debate presages a 
dramatic event which occurred too recently for inclusion in this first edition. 
Viktor Legasov, tagged by the author as one of the country's two leading 
pro-nuclear advocates, actually was sinking into private despair over the poor 
implementation of safety standards. In the end, he made his final and most 
eloquent testimony to this despair on the second anniversary of the accident, 
by committing suicide. For several weeks the Soviets tried to sit on the 
circumstances of his "tragic death," even issuing official non-explanations 
which asserted that the death was not due to medical effects of radiation. 
Finally, crusading journalist Vladimir Gubarev, with access to Legasov's 
notebooks, broke the story in Pravda. Readers of this book will come to know 
these and other characters so well that the suicide fits right into the "big 
picture" of the catastrophe's social impacts. 
</P>
<P>
For an author to so accurately describe a social milieu that subsequent 
unpredictable events only enhance his insights is testimony to the highest 
quality of scholarship. Readers of Marples' book will rarely be surprised as 
the Chernobyl catastrophe's consequences continue to unfold in the future.

<P>
TOCQUEVILLE A BIOGRAPHY BY ANDRE JARDIN; TRANSLATED BY LYDIA DAVIS WITH ROBERT 
HEMENWAY(FARRAR, STRAUS &amp; GIROUX: $30; 548 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Annette J. Smith and David R. Smith , Both Smiths are professors at Caltech 
and co-translators and editors of 'Mademoiselle Irnois' and Other Stories by 
Arthur de Gobineau (University of California Press), who was, among other 
things, Tocqueville's secretary. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andre Jardin's "Tocqueville," surprisingly the first full-scale biography of 
this major 19th-Century figure, is a fine, old-fashioned piece of work, some of 
it original, much of it taken from the ample precedent scholarship. It provides 
an abundant store of information and an occasional surprise -- a dozen years 
after its publication, we find the author of "Democracy in America," now 
minister of foreign affairs, exclaiming: "But what animals these Americans 
are!" 
</P>
<P>
It is as the author of "Democracy in America" that Tocqueville is known in this 
country; but what this biography reveals is not so much an admirer of America 
as a Frenchman of his time, circumstance and needs, even when he is in America. 
He came here with his friend Beaumont ostensibly as a student of penitentiary 
reform, but Tocqueville really wanted to take a larger look at this new 
republic, since it was clear to him that the European drift was in that 
direction, and what intrigued him was its democratic base, since he had been 
brought up to believe that a republic could function only when run by a 
virtuous elite. We know what he found and how he responded, but the biography 
also reveals, almost inadvertently, why he was such an accurate and 
comparatively unbiased observer. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, he had not biased himself by reading contemporary travel 
literature, much of it written by snide Tories pretending to take an 
unprejudiced look at the American experiment. Capt. Basil Hall's infamous 
"Travels" had been only partially translated (the chapter on prison reform) 
into French, and, in any event, it was his companion Beaumont who read it. The 
result was that Tocqueville's vision had not been prejudiced (other than by his 
relative Chateaubriand's romance with New World nature). For another, 
Tocqueville and Beaumont readied themselves each day by preparing questions for 
the people they would meet, questions based upon their own observations sur 
place and designed to elicit responses useful to them as Frenchmen trying to 
prepare themselves for a possible future. They were not, as were the Tories, 
justifying a past. 
</P>
<P>
Tocqueville's Cartesian clarity, his relative lack of bias, meant that he used 
the answers to his questions to form a useful statement about America, but the 
questions themselves and their reasons reveal perhaps even more about France. 
By looking at this intelligent, open-minded, and inquiring young civil servant 
and nobleman of impeccable political parentage (great grandson of Malesherbes), 
Jardin's book provides the American reader a marvelous introduction to the 
political shiftings, the gradual yet sometimes violent post-revolutionary 
cracking of the political structure in France as it grappled simultaneously 
with the shattered legitimacy of the past, a slippery present and an 
ill-defined future. 
</P>
<P>
After the immediate success of "Democracy in America" (1835), Tocqueville 
entered the political arena and was elected deputy for the arrondissement of 
Valognes, the region of his family castle in Normandy. He sat left of center in 
the Chamber. Although many at the time thought of him as an Carlist aristocrat 
and some in this country think of him as an American-style conservative, 
Tocqueville considered the old aristocracy "dead for ever." Over the years, he 
demonstrated his liberalism by fighting for parliamentary monarchy, separation 
of church and state, reform of the suffrage laws, improvement of the worker's 
lot, for liberalizing public education, abolishing slavery wherever it existed, 
improving the prison system and eliminating poverty. He managed, nevertheless, 
to stay clear of several more powerful champions of liberal causes such as 
Lamartine, Royer-Collard, and Thiers, who would have liked to have him on their 
side but whose egos he mistrusted. 
</P>
<P>
Independence is what most characterizes Tocqueville's career. A colleague 
reproached him for "giving the right hand to the left, the left to the right 
and regretting that he does not have a third one to give invisibly." "Freedom 
is the strongest of my passions. Voila. It is the truth," he explained to 
disconcerted observers. If he moved left, it was, he claimed, to impose his 
color on the left, not change his own. 
</P>
<P>
Another constant was his hatred of centralization. In "L'Ancien Regime et la 
Revolution," Tocqueville analyzed the roots of centralization in France, which 
according to him went as far back as the reign of Philip the Fair in the Middle 
Ages. He lamented the fact that centralization had destroyed time-tested local 
organic structures and that the French nobility itself was at fault in the 
process. Tocqueville fought centralism in all of its manifestations as he saw 
them. For instance, rather an agnostic himself, he defended religious education 
because he believed in the healthy necessity of a third force besides the state 
and the people. 
</P>
<P>
Tocqueville's anticentralism colored his responses to the various colonial 
enterprises that characterize European history of the period. Thus, in newly 
conquered Algeria, he favored a kind of settlement based on local autonomy 
rather than central metropolitan power. He was the first man in the Chamber to 
push for a separate ministry for Algeria -- a dream that became a fact only a 
century later in Leon Blum's cabinet. He deplored the downfall of the Ottoman 
Empire in the Middle East, since the Turks were not only a desirable bumper 
between the major European predators, but also relatively tolerant themselves 
toward the diversity of their possessions. He admired the respect for local 
customs that the British had shown in India. 
</P>
<P>
Tocqueville was an active, intelligent legislator, esteemed particularly for 
his work on penitentiary reform (inspired by the Philadelphia system) and on 
the abolition of slavery, but he was not a sensational figurehead. One might 
say that, like Montaigne, he had lived through a great deal of political 
turmoil and managed to preserve an independent judgment. When Louis-Napoleon 
was propelled into the presidency at the end of the bloody 1848 revolution, 
Tocqueville was given the foreign affairs ministry in the Barrot cabinet. He 
served with the same unsensational distinction as in the Chamber but was fired 
after only five months. He had protested Louis-Napoleon's coup d'etat that made 
an emperor of the president and was briefly imprisoned in Vincennes -- luckier 
in this than one of our great-grandfathers, who was sent to the Sahara for the 
same offense. From then to his death from tuberculosis in Cannes in 1859, 
Tocqueville led the life of a gentleman farmer and journalist who, amid 
numerous changes of residence to accommodate his health, wrote (but did not 
finish) "L'Ancien Regime et la Revolution." 
</P>
<P>
This long and scrupulous study of a man who was one of the most profound and 
prophetic thinkers of his time, is, alas, scrupulous to the point of boredom. 
The narration rarely deviates from an inexhaustible concatenation of facts 
related in the soberest of prose. Although it does justice to Tocqueville's 
ideas, it fails in rendering the passion and the grace of his intellectual life 
and the social brilliance of the era. Moreover, the book is curiously 
organized: The order followed a mixture of the chronological and of the 
thematic, with several baffling leaps from one to the other. Andre Jardin's 
work constitutes an excellent work of reference for the scholar. It is indexed 
and substantially but not cumbersomely footnoted. Still it makes the layman 
yearn for the livelier manner of much recent historical writing.

TUNGSTEN A NOVEL BY CESAR VALLEJO; TRANSLATED BY ROBERT MEZEY; FOREWORD BY 
KEVIN J. O'CONNOR (SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY PRESS: $19.95; 168 PP.; 0-8156-0226-X)

By Edith Grossman, Grossman is a critic and translator of Latin American 
literature. She teaches at Dominican College in New York State, is the author 
of The Antipoetry of Nicanor Parra and recently translated Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera.

<TEXT>
<P>
Why read "Tungsten," a partisan novel written almost 60 years ago in which evil 
is unmitigated, virtue unblemished, and the characters seem to lack dimension 
or complexity as they play out their predetermined roles on the stage of the 
class struggle? Why read a book in which ideology reigns supreme, and why 
celebrate its first, belated translation into English? Because the author is 
Cesar Vallejo, one of the great poets of the 20th Century and a major figure in 
Latin American literature. 
</P>
<P>
Vallejo created a wrenching poetic language for Spanish that radically altered 
the shape of its imagery and the nature of its rhythms. No facile trend setter, 
Vallejo forged a new discourse in order to express his own visceral compassion 
for human suffering. He saw the world in piercing flashes of outrage and 
anguish, terror and pity, and what he saw wounded him like knife thrusts. A 
passionate, tragic poet, he mourned our loss of moral innocence and despaired 
of the injustice that moves the world. In the late 1920s, when he was living in 
Paris and eking out a meager livelihood as a journalist, the pain at the roots 
of his being found objective substantiation in radical politics. 
</P>
<P>
Born in the Peruvian Andes in 1892, he witnessed firsthand the victimization 
and exploitation of the South American Indians. Although his own family was not 
financially destitute (his father was a notary and minor bureaucrat in the 
small town of Santiago de Chuco), Vallejo was a cholo, a person born of mixed 
European and Indian ancestry. The fact is not irrelevant. In a society where 
social and economic status followed the color line with cosmic certainty, where 
racial discrimination was rigidly adhered to although rarely acknowledged in 
public, the representatives of foreign companies, with the wholehearted 
complicity of domestic colleagues, extracted high profits from the near-slavery 
of the illiterate, utterly alienated and ultimately helpless victims of that 
racism. Vallejo had ample opportunity to witness the brutalization en masse of 
the Indian underclass and the appalling greed of their lighter-skinned masters 
who carried on the colonial tradition of using Indians as forced labor in mines 
and on plantations. 
</P>
<P>
Twentieth-Century writers from Ciro Alegria to Manuel Scorza have denounced the 
Peruvian tragedy in their books. "Tungsten" was one of the earliest novels to 
do so in modern terms. As a young man, however, Vallejo's greatest energies 
were devoted to writing and publishing his poems ("Los heraldos negros," his 
first book, appeared in 1918); consequently, he remained on the periphery of 
the windstorms of political and social unrest that swept through South America 
in the second decade of the century, although he was in the time and place 
where growing agitation to establish justice for Peruvian Indians and workers 
began its inexorable march toward Marxism. 
</P>
<P>
Vallejo, Jose Carlos Mariategui (the "Shining Path" in today's Peru takes its 
name from his writings) and Victor Raul Haya de la Torre (a founder of the 
important APRA movement -- the "Popular Revolutionary American Alliance") 
crossed paths at the university in Trujillo. But Vallejo was an intermittent 
student. His family began to experience economic difficulties during his 
adolescence, and he was obliged to interrupt secondary school and then his 
university studies to take a series of jobs, which included office work in the 
mines at Tambores and Quiruvilca, and on a large sugar plantation in the 
Chicama Valley. 
</P>
<P>
These facts are not irrelevant either. They provided the historical raw 
material for "Tungsten," the documented background to Vallejo's outcry against 
the grim realities of Indian life in Peru. The shape that material would take 
-- his conviction that the problem of race was indistinguishable from the 
problem of class -- was determined by his increasingly active commitment to 
socialism, a political engagement that, by 1930, led to his expulsion from 
France, where he had gone to live seven years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The action of the novel is centered in a fictional mining town and its 
provincial capital, Colca. The time is 1917, just before the U.S. entry into 
World War I when a ready supply of tungsten would be crucial to the weapons 
industry. A North American corporation takes over the mine, and the boom is on: 
Peasants are first lured and then coerced into working for the company, local 
Indians, the Soras, are cheated of their land and animals, petit bourgeois 
entrepreneurs scramble on the backs of the poor for wealth and position, and 
venal officials and dignitaries find a new source of bribery and 
power-brokering in the foreign capitalists. The first two-thirds of the book, 
in fact, constitutes a genre study of unashamed thuggery, a series of vignettes 
of corruption, repression and brutality that sets the stage for the violent 
heart of "Tungsten" and the appearance of its proletarian Indian hero, Servando 
Huanca. 
</P>
<P>
Two Indian boys are forcibly conscripted into military service (the military as 
well as the mining contractors have "body quotas" -- numbers of recruits or 
workers that must be obtained by any means), and on the long march from their 
homes to Colca, when they are tied by the waist to the mules that their captors 
ride, they are so badly abused that one of them eventually dies. Outside the 
Subprefecture an angry crowd gathers, indignant at the visible signs of the 
conscripts' mistreatment. One defiant man, Servando Huanca, steps forward to 
speak for the crowd with natural authority and an instinctive class 
consciousness. These qualities inspire the people and momentarily cow the 
authorities, but then the troops are ordered to fire into the crowd, and later 
that night officially sanctioned vigilantes pursue any Indian they can find, 
shooting to kill. Some, however, are taken into custody, and deals are struck 
by sleazy officials which allow the prisoners to be sent off to a sure death in 
the mines to help fulfill the company's "body quota." 
</P>
<P>
Last and certainly least, the third section of the book is a kind of postscript 
to the Colca massacre. Vallejo allows his indignation and passion to turn into 
mechanical ideology: Servando Huanca "duckspeaks" a mercifully brief exercise 
in orthodoxy, proclaiming that world revolution is under way, that it will be 
led by a militant proletariat inspired by Lenin and not by bourgeois 
"intellectuals," that it will sweep away the ruling classes in Peru. Vallejo 
even permits the novel to end with this ponderously symbolic sentence: 
"Outside, the wind was rising, portending storm." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin J. O'Connor has written a thoughtful and informative foreword, Robert 
Mezey has done a fine job of translating Vallejo's often quirky Spanish, and 
both of them deserve our gratitude for their sensitivity and skill in bringing 
the work to the attention of an English-language audience. I am sorry that I 
cannot say as much for the editing. The typographical errors are frequent and 
unforgivable, and there is no indication as one reads that Mezey has provided 
important end notes to the text. This is a disservice to the reader; Vallejo 
and his translator deserve better.

EXTINCT IN THE LAND OF FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
WHO WILL REMEMBER THE PEOPLE BY JEAN RASPAIL; TRANSLATED BY JEREMY LEGGATT 
(MERCURY HOUSE: $18.95; 215 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Schmitt , Schmitt is a professor of Latin American literature at CSU 
Long Beach whose latest work is a translation of Chilean poet Raul Zurita's 
Anteparadise (University of California Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The four tribes of the now-extinct native Americans that once inhabited the 
Tierra del Fuego archipelago -- that ships' graveyard along the land's end, 
southern tip of South America -- were among the most primitive and hardy 
peoples encountered in the New World. In this fine piece of historical fiction 
cum-exemplary story, French novelist Jean Raspail explores the sad fate of the 
Alacalufs (who called themselves Kaweskar, "The People"), the lesser known of 
the two tribes of sea-nomads or "canoe Indians." 
</P>
<P>
Raspail reconstructs the history of the Alacalufs through their own eyes and 
those of Magellan, Drake and other historical figures. In this noble quest of 
the "other" (those whose languages and customs seemed so alien to Europeans 
that they refused to admit that they belonged to the human species), the view 
from "within" is attempted through a synopsis of generations, of millennia, in 
the mind of the character Lafko, a kind of collective memory of the Alacalufs. 
The view from "without" reveals a shameful history of smug disdain: From 
Magellan on, Europeans judged the Alacalufs to be "ugly," "stinking," 
"disgusting," "brutish," "beasts," "animals"; they kidnaped them, enslaved them 
and, at worst, their genocidal instincts unleashed, they turned their guns and 
cannons on them for sport, exterminated them; in the end, they were hunted for 
bounty or herded into missionary stations where they died of white man's 
diseases or the despair of captivity, and the last stragglers were reduced to 
bartering and begging in the shipping lanes of the Strait of Magellan. The 
complicity of scientists (like Darwin) in fostering this outcome is addressed 
in a couple of the chapters. 
</P>
<P>
The other side of the coin -- that our survival, too, depends on our ability to 
embrace others not as a function of our own ideal but of theirs -- is seen in 
the tragic fate of the inhabitants of Name of Jesus and the City of King 
Philip, Spain's first settlement communities in Tierra del Fuego,who went mad 
or starved to death. The English privateer Cavendish rechristened the latter 
city Port Famine. 
</P>
<P>
The point is brought home in the moving chapter, "A Civilized Gentleman." Sir 
John Byron, shipwrecked in the Strait in his youth and rescued by the 
Alacalufs, returns to the scene years later and ponders the legacy of European 
contacts: "What an endless history of contempt is unraveled! And yet . . . ." 
An instinct for survival had not saved his fellow castaways. He alone had 
survived by crossing the cultural abyss and living with the Alacaluf clan for 
six months, and the clan had braved the seas and their fears of the world 
beyond their territory to set him down on an island from which Chilotan seal 
hunters returned him to Puerto Montt. 
</P>
<P>
But when Raspail attempts to give us a glimpse from within (the inner life of 
the Alacalufs), the reader is aware of a European mind wedged between him and 
the "other." The Alacalufs are "endlessly fleeing," "forsaken" pariahs, 
"commanded by fate to survive, not to live" in a land shrouded in "an eternally 
black sky," "a witches' dance of cruel winds," "a hell of snow and winds." 
</P>
<P>
But this area is also stunningly beautiful, and Father Martin Gusinde has 
compared the Yamana, a sister tribe, to 'fidgety birds of passage who were 
happy and inwardly calm only when they were on the move'). In two recent works, 
Bruce Chatwin ("The Songlines") and Mario Vargas Llosa ("El Hablador" ("The 
Speaker") ) convincingly draw the reader into the soul-life, the Earth-bound 
myths and legends of the Australian Bushmen and the Peruvian Machiguengas, 
respectively. Raspail is far less successful in a parallel attempt with the 
Alacalufs, and the fault is not in Jeremy Leggatt's translation, which is 
excellent. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that limitation, Raspail's story, inscribed in the dialogue of cultures 
so characteristic of our age, is a fine version in historical fiction of a true 
story loud with ethical reverberations. As First-World nations, we are 
collectively responsible for the fate of colonized and subjugated peoples in 
the Third World, but we have hardly begun to address those responsibilities.

Shirley Temple Black will be playing a return engagement in Pasadena when she 
presides over the Tournament of Roses Parade on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
As a curly-headed child star, she was grand marshal of the 1939 parade 50 years 
ago, the youngest in the parade's history. Now, she's been invited back to be 
grand marshal of the 100th Rose Parade, which starts Monday at 8 a.m. (to be 
covered on various TV stations; see Watchables for details). She joins a select 
group of others who have been grand marshals twice: Bob Hope, Richard Nixon and 
Earl Warren. 
</P>
<P>
Riding in the parade with Mrs. Black this year will be her granddaughter, 
Teresa Falaschi, shown with her on the cover.

FICTION IN BRIEF: ROCK ME 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

This novel's hip style, smooth tone and sensual spirit distinctively recall the 
music of Steely Dan, a resemblance which turns out to be more than accidental, 
for Marcelle Clements lives with Donald Fagen, Steely Dan's lead singer and 
composer. Clements, a journalist, wrote "Rock Me" in part to evoke the lives of 
the musicians she first met at New York City's High School of Music and Art and 
then toured with in a yearlong stint as one of Fagen's backup singers. On this 
level, "Rock Me" is absorbing and believable. Casey and Michael, Clements' 
protagonists, are accurate portrayals of 1960s rockers grappling with the late 
1980s. Up on shrinks, down on drugs (after years of riding high) and longing 
for friendship though often sidetracked by lust, they speak in a delightfully 
spacey dialect from somewhere in between the San Fernando Valley and the New 
School for Social Research: "It's just been a horrible grind for so long," 
Casey tells Michael, "that now I have this, like, unbelievable negative tropism 
about all of it." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Clements' language, with no evidence of satire, strays from the 
eccentric to the insipid. "You really have a great tan," Casey tells Michael. 
"I hope so," he responds. "Because that's all I have." Clements' point of view 
is also stylistically problematic, changing from first to third person for no 
apparent reason. A final problem is Clements' attempt to study a love triangle. 
Casey, the burnt-out lead singer in a highly successful band, leaves New York 
City to recuperate in Hawaii. There, she meets Michael, her former lover and 
band partner, and his girlfriend Leslie. Sensing the desire between Casey and 
Michael, Leslie, hardly monogamous herself, sanctions an affair between the 
two. Casey and Michael eventually make love, but rather than confronting her 
feelings toward Michael, Casey abruptly returns to New York, riddled with guilt 
over her "dirty deed." 
</P>
<P>
Clements' portrait of Casey, nevertheless, is an intimate and credible sketch 
of a neurotic artist. Casey returns to New York confused, but creatively 
reinvigorated, concluding that she can only realize her fantasies in her music: 
"The best affair is the affair you don't have . . . except in your songs."

MEMORIES OF A CHINESE-AMERICAN BOYHOOD; 
</P>
<P>
THE CHINAMAN PACIFIC &amp; FRISCO R.R. CO. BY FRANK CHIN (COFFEE HOUSE PRESS: 
$9.95; 184 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Douglas Sun, Sun, a Chinese-American graduate student at the University of 
Chicago, is seeking a publisher for his first novel.

<TEXT>
<P>
When I think of some friends of mine from the old neighborhood (all of whom had 
the proper ethnic credentials, let me assure you), one thing I remember is our 
wariness of what we called "I Have a Problem" literature. By that, we meant 
literature of ethnic experience at its most tiresome: brooding, Angst-ridden 
story-polemics, crammed to the gills with resentment and righteous anger, about 
existential misery in the Land of the Round-Eye; literature that seemed to 
assume that any bit of drivel was worth your attention just as long as it had a 
chip on its shoulder. It's a species related to what Calvin Trillin called the 
"kvetch novel" -- any novel in which you want to say to the main character, 
"Oh, just pull up your socks" -- only more irritating. But it's also an easy 
trap for anyone who writes from an ethnocentric point of view to fall into. It 
is, therefore, to Frank Chin's credit that his collection of short stories, 
"The Chinaman Pacific &amp; Frisco R.R. Co." by and large avoids this trap even 
as it dances on the edge of the pit. 
</P>
<P>
There are eight stories in this volume, most of them autobiographical in tone. 
Almost all have as their essential subject the alienation of Chinese-America 
from the America of white skin and Wonder Bread. The first two, "Railroad 
Standard Time" and "The Eat and Run Midnight People," read like meandering 
stream-of-consciousness memoirs and are self-indulgent enough to make them the 
weakest of the bunch. The final story, "The Sons of Chan," clothes itself in 
shreds of fiction with some interesting Freudian overtones, but it is otherwise 
a tiring screed on growing up with the stereotypes in Charlie Chan movies as 
your only reflection in popular culture. Chin's rhetoric is often sharp and 
funny, but he also rides the high horse of racial bitterness for more than it's 
worth. 
</P>
<P>
It's the other five stories that distinguish "The Chinaman Pacific &amp; Frisco 
R.R. Co." In them, Chin displays two considerable writerly virtues. One is a 
wicked sense of humor that runs a provocative gamut from jangled whimsy to 
scathing satire. His subject matter is weighty enough so that an amusing 
conceit or figuration often balances out the mood. This is particularly true of 
"A Chinese Lady Dies," in which the narrator's problematic (and disturbingly 
Oedipal) relationship with his mother evokes such tension that the story would 
self-immolate without the whimsical dream passages in which he imagines himself 
as an Old-Western hero called E. Chino. His wit feels more like a dagger than a 
feather, but is no less amusing for it. And for good measure, Chin tacks on an 
afterword that reads suspiciously like a freewheeling satire on Maxine Hong 
Kingston's "The Woman Warrior." 
</P>
<P>
 His other primary virtue is his considerable skill as a storyteller. He has a 
genuine gift for bringing characters and their predicaments alive. One sees 
this most vividly in "The Only Real Day," which focuses on the struggle of an 
aged immigrant to keep American culture at bay and preserve his identity as a 
Chinese. Chin has a definite point to make in this story about the corrosion of 
Chinese values and identity in a mostly white world, but the message is 
filtered so thoroughly through the plot and well-drawn characters that it has 
no didactic harshness. It is, above all, a poignant and entrancing piece of 
fiction. "Yes, Young Daddy," which depicts the protagonist's relationship with 
a female cousin who is grappling with adolescence, is also worth noting for its 
skillful portraiture. 
</P>
<P>
Chin's prose style tends toward a looseness vaguely reminiscent of William S. 
Burroughs. It's lively stuff but also slow going at times, what with the 
missing antecedents, plastic sentence structure and all. He also enjoys playing 
fast and loose with temporal shifts in his stories, with the result that 
memory, present experience, anticipation and pure fantasy often overlap. It's 
an absorbingly dense reflection of the way in which past, present and future 
come to bear upon each other in the mind, but everything melds so seamlessly 
that the reader may have some trouble keeping things sorted. 
</P>
<P>
On the whole, Chin does a good job of avoiding the hazards that could have 
swallowed up these stories. Although alienation is the great theme of 
post-World War II American literature and our age is distinguished by its 
voices from outside the mainstream, just because a work is about racial 
alienation doesn't automatically make it worth reading. The problem with 
ethnocentric literature is that its force is so centripetal. It tends to reach 
inward, instead of outward toward the universal significance that, as Northrop 
Frye said, marks literature in its highest form. Fiction need not reach that 
level to be worth our while, but it should at least show a human dimension that 
will move us and provoke us, as mere formalized pique cannot. Fortunately, "The 
Chinaman Pacific &amp; Frisco R.R. Co." achieves such transcendance often 
enough to make it worthwhile fiction.

<P>
The Sunday evening movie lineup is one of the strongest in memory, commencing 
at 6 p.m. on Channel 5 with Mel Brooks' hilarious 1974 horror picture spoof, 
Young Frankenstein, with Gene Wilder heading a terrific cast. 
</P>
<P>
Chariots of Fire (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.), the 1981 multi-Oscar winner, 
traces the parallel lives of two very different athletes who became part of the 
remarkable British track and field team at the 1924 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Silent Victory: The Kitty O'Neil Story (Channel 9 Sunday at 7 p.m.) is an 
exceptionally well-made 1979 TV movie with Stockard Channing starring in this 
real-life story about a deaf woman who became one of Hollywood's top stunt 
women. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, Mel Brooks' 1968 debut film The Producers (Channel 5 Sunday at 8 
p.m.) is even funnier than "Young Frankenstein." It's a zany farce in which 
Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder come up with a cockamamie scheme to profit from 
staging a terrible play. 
</P>
<P>
The 1972 Frenzy (Channel 13 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is the finest of Alfred 
Hitchcock's last films, a thriller set in his native London and dealing with a 
man (Jon Finch) wrongly accused of being a serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
The Karen Carpenter Story (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) stars Cynthia Gibb in the 
title role of this new TV movie about the popular singer who died at 32 from 
the affects of anorexia nervosa. Mitchell Anderson plays Carpenter's brother 
and singing partner Richard. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 Gremlins (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful 
Life" turned inside out, upside down and pickled in brine, a sweet-and-sour 
comedy featuring an invasion of a small Middle American town by a horde of 
fast-multiplying, deceptively cute, furry creatures. 
</P>
<P>
The 14th James Bond adventure A View to a Kill (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a 
so-so affair, with Roger Moore beginning to look a little weary as 007 (Timothy 
Dalton would replace him in the next Bond, the 1987 "Living Daylights"). This 
time the villain is Christopher Walken, intent on destroying Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Watching Terry Gilliam's 1985 Brazil (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.), an 
exploding cigar in the face of the future, is like watching Gilliam's head 
erupt in public. Everything that has ever made an impact on the film maker 
seems to be whirling by in this brilliant, exhausting, savagely funny 
post-Orwellian satire, set in the gray confines of the Ministry of Information 
where his shiningly innocent hero (Jonathan Pryce) toils in his cherished 
anonymity. Gilliam's targets are the usual Monty Python concerns: modern 
technology and the men who run it, terrorists, repairmen, bureaucrats, the 
plastic surgery industry, the ad game and sticklers for detail, wherever they 
are. 
</P>
<P>
Terror on Highway 91 (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie, stars Ricky 
Schroder in the true story of a young man who exposes police corruption in a 
small southern town. George Dzundza and Matt Clark co-star. 
</P>
<P>
Blake Edwards' 1979 10 (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m., again on Saturday at 10 
p.m.), a modern comedy classic, stars Dudley Moore as a popular composer who, 
in the clutch of middle age, pursues a beautiful young bride (Bo Derek) all the 
way to Mexico, where she is honeymooning. This is a superbly constructed film 
which makes shrewd observations of the American obsession with sex and youth, 
California-style. 
</P>
<P>
The Man in the Brown Suit (CBS Wednesday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie updating 
Agatha Christie's 1924 mystery novel about a young American woman (Stephanie 
Zimbalist) traveling through Egypt in search of adventure. Rue McClanahan, Tony 
Randall and Edward Woodward star. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Reiner's 1984 This Is Spinal Tap (Channel 28 Friday at 11:30 p.m.) is one 
of the funniest movies of the decade, a delicious sendup on the making of a 
rock documentary in which Reiner casts himself as a film maker trying to make a 
record of a seedy English group on tour. The line between parody and reality 
becomes exceedingly and riotously thin. 
</P>
<P>
The dreadful 1986 comedy Armed and Dangerous (CBS Saturday at 8 p.m.) plays 
like a third-generation dupe print of "Police Academy," with frantic splices 
from "Beverly Hills Cop." John Candy and Eugene Levy star as a pair of goofy 
misfits adrift in a Los Angeles populated entirely by bozos, nitwits, boobs and 
cads. 
</P>
<P>
Brian De Palma's 1983 remake of Howard Hawks' 1932 gangster classic Scarface 
(ABC Saturday at 8 p.m.) moves the action from Chicago in the '20s to Miami's 
Cuban community of the present, but for all its operatic razzle-dazzle, it 
becomes a lurid exercise in wretched excess. Al Pacino has the title role as a 
doomed drug kingpin.

PICTURING MANZANAR; 
</P>
<P>
MANZANAR BY JOHN ARMOUR AND PETER WRIGHT PHOTOGRAPHS BY ANSEL ADAMS, COMMENTARY 
BY JOHN HERSEY (TIMES BOOKS: $27.50; 167 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Kishiyama , Kishiyama, a Calendar assistant editor, was born in the 
Heart Mountain, Wyo., relocation camp. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There could not be a more powerful combination than words by John Hersey and 
photographs by Ansel Adams. When the subject matter is "Manzanar" and the 
unconstitutional imprisoning of Japanese-Americans during World War II, the 
combination would seem to be explosive -- and is. 
</P>
<P>
Eloquent and moving, Hersey's 15,000-word essay details how this tragedy came 
into being: "The bitterest national shame of the Second World War for the sweet 
land of liberty: the mass incarceration, on racial grounds alone, on false 
evidence of military necessity, and in contempt of their supposedly inalienable 
rights, of an entire class of American citizens -- along with others who were 
not citizens in the country of their choice only because that country had long 
denied people of their race the right to naturalize." 
</P>
<P>
Equally moving are Adams' photographs, originally taken to document life in 
Manzanar, just a speck on the map in Inyo County in the rugged eastern Sierra 
before it became one of 10 camps established to hold about 120,000 
Japanese-Americans from 1942 to 1945. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Hersey's contribution occupies only the first 66 pages. Worse, 
Adams' pictures have been culled to less than half of the 204 pictures he 
donated to the Library of Congress. Many of these historic photographs are 
reproduced at sizes much smaller than snapshots developed in a hour at your 
corner photo shop. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of letting Hersey and Adams' words and pictures tell the story, the 
book dilutes the saga and turns it into another stereotypical tale of 
Japanese-Americana: how we overcame hardship and made the best of a bad 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
The titles of the three different contributions to the book indicate three 
different approaches: outrage in Hersey's "A Mistake of Terrifically Horrible 
Proportions," irony in Adams' "Born Free and Equal" and the bland in Armour and 
Wright's "A Portrait of Manzanar." 
</P>
<P>
Now that a redress bill has been passed by Congress and signed by the 
President, which would grant every living internee $20,000, the horrifying 
mistake of nearly 50 years ago has been officially rectified. But not the 
lasting impression that what the government did was wrong. For chipping away at 
this stone wall the book's authors and publisher have to be congratulated. 
</P>
<P>
But how much better it would have been for the book to at least mention that 
Ansel Adams' Manzanar photos, when put on display after 40 years, were 
criticized by some Japanese-Americans as "prettifying" the harsh camp 
experience. Or that many of those photographed carry hidden pyschological scars 
from the war fought within. Or that most of those photographed have long since 
died, never qualifying for the $20,000 and carrying to their graves the thought 
that they were "guilty" as never charged.

Set in Australia at the turn of the 20th Century, "Waiting for Childhood" is 
the story of seven children left to cope for themselves after their parents 
die. Their father, The Rev. William Lord, expires at the breakfast table one 
morning. After the family leaves for a ramshackle house owned by a wealthy 
cousin, the mother loses her mind and then her life in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
The eldest daughter, Lily, takes charge of the entire household, as Jess 
becomes a favorite of her rich cousin Jackie and watches her rival for Jackie's 
affections fall fatally from a mountaintop. 
</P>
<P>
These characters, "all talented, all deeply human, (are) all so beautifully 
realized that by the end of the novel we identify with them to the point of 
heartbreak," Carolyn See wrote in these pages. " 'Waiting for Childhood' 
manages to be at once terribly melancholy and extraordinarily exhilarating."

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: LEAVING HOME BY GARRISON KEILLOR (PENGUIN BOOKS: $4.95)

Penguin Books has here collected 36 of the host of "A Prairie Home Companion's" 
radio monologues, each beginning with the words "it has been a quiet week in 
Lake Wobegon" -- a town "where all the women are strong, the men are 
good-looking, and all the children are above average." 
</P>
<P>
Those who have been charmed by Keillor's wistful American pastoral will be 
pleased to learn, as Dan Sullivan put it in his review, that "Keillor doesn't 
ramble as much in type as he did on the air. Something else does come across 
better on the page: the realization that Lake Wobegon does not exist. . . . 
Every now and then, the whole town starts to waver, like a mirage, and you see 
Keillor . . . wondering whether to send a character into her house to discover 
the mess that her kids have made, or to let her take a walk around the block 
first."

On May 10, 1896, acting on a report by French engineer Victor Prompt that the 
headwaters of the Nile could be dammed up, "turning the great waterway on and 
off like a bathtub spigot," Capt. Jean-Baptiste Marchand sails from Marseilles 
to the French Congo and begins his trek across Africa to the Nile with 150-odd 
Senegalese soldiers. They arrive in Fashoda in July, 1898. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the British launch an Anglo-Egyptian army of 30,000 men under 
the leadership of Herbert Kitchener. These men build a railroad across the 
desert, meet up with another 60,000-man army and arrive in Fashoda in 
September, 1898. 
</P>
<P>
"On September 19, Marchand and Kitchener exchanged champagne toasts aboard a 
British gunboat anchored off Fashoda before politely threatening to destroy 
each other," David Levering Lewis writes in this absorbing history. "On 
November 4, Paris ordered recently promoted Major Marchand to abandon his 
fortress." 
</P>
<P>
Drawing from the archives of African states, from newly translated political 
correspondence as well as memoirs, Lewis exposes the sometimes absurd imperial 
energies of European states and the emerging role of African nations.

Negotiations are under way for Dustin Hoffman to play the title role in 
Warners' on-again, off-again "Phantom" -- the opera story updated to 
Nazi-occupied Germany. Originally at Lorimar, the script's recently been 
revamped by James Dearden ("Fatal Attraction"), with filming to begin in April. 
Wolfgang Petersen directs and co-produces with C.O. Erickson. . . . Family 
ties: Actor-producer James Keach makes his directorial debut with "The 
Forgotten," the story of Vietnam MIAs released after 17 years' imprisonment. 
But a sinister plot develops when the soldiers are debriefed in Berlin. It 
stars Keith Carradine, Stacy Keach and Steve Railsback, who 
co-wrote/co-produces with Keach, James. Mimi Maynard and Sandra Will, 
respectively the wives of James Keach and Carradine, also have roles. 
Production starts late January for Paramount. . . . 
</P>

Emily Lloyd will star in "Letters for Iris," the story of a young woman who 
becomes a nanny as a means to avenge a terrible wrong. Israel Horvitz wrote the 
yarn, which films late spring in Boston, for producer Robert Lawrence. Burt 
Young joins Joseph Mantegna and Faye Dunaway in Zoetrope's "Wait Until Spring, 
Bandini," filming in Utah next February. Fred Roos, Erwin Provoost and Tom 
Luddy produce the story of immigrant life in the 1920s. Dominique Deruddere is 
writer-director. Tom Waits will score. . . .

Trueheart, who is yet to be cast.

Rodriguez's interview with corporate attorney Elsa Banuelos was dismaying. 
Banuelos states that she is "tired of translating" when called upon by client 
or other attorneys to assist them with the busboys. Would Banuelos feel just as 
tired, or rather, embarrassed, to translate while negotiating a contract with 
another attorney or a Spanish-speaking client? I think not. It is unfortunate 
that Banuelos is not proud of her ability to converse in Spanish, even if it is 
only used to ask the busboy for another glass of water.

Leo Estrada's suggested model of middle-class Mexican-Americans creating 
country clubs for ourselves so as to pass on our advantages to our young is 
probably unnecessary. Instead, the Latino professionals profiled in the article 
could directly benefit the next Mexican-American generation by teaching them 
their skills. For example, the Cal Poly Pomona campus (where I teach) boasts 
14% Latino students, and its School of Business Administration, with the 
largest number of declared majors on campus who are Latino and black, regularly 
hires practicing financial consultants and lawyers on a visiting, part-time 
basis. Although the money isn't great, sweet satisfactions can derive from 
having a Latino student earn the top grade on a corporate finance exam (as just 
happened to me) or from submitting a proposal to the National Science 
Foundation to establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site where 
students may, under my guidance, undertake a yearlong study of attitudes and 
experiences of Latino MBAs in U.S. corporations.

The articles on Gaddi Vasquez ("Gaddi Vasquez: On the Republican Fast Track,"

time for a change in stereotypical attitudes toward Hispanics. We have a large 
middle class that people seem to ignore.

ART NEWS: AN EXHIBIT WHOSE TIME HAS COME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phyllis Plous admits that six years is a long time to put together any exhibit. 
Her timing seems auspicious, however. When the curator began organizing a show 
of abstract painting in 1982, in her words, the art form was "relegated to the 
dust bins." Today, as "Abstract Options" is about to open, that is all changed. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a definite acceleration of interest in abstraction since the 
mid-'80s," said Plous, who with Frances Colpitt co-curated the 32-painting 
exhibit, opening Friday at UC Santa Barbara's University Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
The project began when Colpitt, a critic and art historian, arrived at UCSB to 
teach, said Plous, University Art Museum curator. "Neo Expressionism was so 
rampant at the time and we began to wonder why we only saw Abstract art in 
artists' studios." 
</P>
<P>
Ten contemporary artists from the east and west coasts are represented in the 
show. The co-curators chose artists that differed in their treatment of surface 
and form, but shared a preference for a lush richness. 
</P>
<P>
"The show perhaps is about sensuality and the process of painting," Plous said. 
"Unlike Neo-Geo, this is not dry illustrative abstraction. I don't like the 
word pretty very much, but I think it's going to be a beautiful show." 
</P>
<P>
Artists in the exhibit are Edith Baumann-Hudson, Moira Dryer, Heidi Gluck, 
Nancy Haynes, James Hayward, Mary Heilmann, Julian Lethbridge, John M. Miller, 
Paul Mogensen and Stephen Westfall. It is scheduled to run in Santa Barbara 
through Feb. 26, then travel to Evanston, Ill., and Santa Clara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
RETIRING: Artist La Monte Westmoreland, who established Los Angeles' most 
active high school-based gallery, will retire this month to concentrate on his 
own artwork after 10 years as director of Roberts Art Gallery at Santa Monica 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I just need to have more studio time," Westmoreland said, now making mostly 
mixed-media collages shown at Lizardi/Harp Gallery in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Lita Albuquerque, John Swihart, Laddie John Dill, Guy Dill and Sandra Mendelson 
Rubin lead an illustrious list of local artists, many of them alumni of the 
high school, who regularly took part in Westmoreland's exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica-based artist Peter Alexander, who for several years donated works 
for annual auctions to support the gallery, lauded Westmoreland's efforts that 
he said turned the space, founded in 1935, into a unique showcase for local 
emerging and established artists that particularly benefited the high school's 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole deal was La Monte's doing," said Alexander, one of this city's 
best-known painters whose two daughters went to Santa Monica High School. "His 
enthusiasm, in terms of bringing work to the students, has been quite 
extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
Ann Goodwin, a painting instructor at the high school, will succeed 
Westmoreland, whose final exhibit, "Paintings and Sculptures," Jan. 5 through 
Jan. 26, features eight artists. (See art openings for details.) 
</P>
<P>
LACE GRANTS: Local interdisciplinary artists developing new work may apply for 
grants from Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE), now in the fourth year 
of its Grant Program for Interdisciplinary Artists. More than $30,200 are 
available for individuals or groups of artists working collaboratively. For 
information and an application, call LACE at (213) 624-5650. June Scott heads 
up the program. 
</P>
<P>
IN PUBLIC: Public art and its preservation, issues of increasing concern 
nationwide, are the theme of a new publication. "Going Public: A Field Guide to 
Developments in Art in Public Places" was produced with the input of 30 
nationally recognized artists, public art administrators, design professionals 
and others brought together by the National Endowment for the Arts to examine 
public art issues. For information, contact the Arts Education Service at the 
University of Massachusetts, (413) 545-2360.

RESTAURANT NOTEBOOK: FLOCKING TOGETHER AND CHICKENING OUT

Chicken is chicken, right? Well, not always, it appears. A new catalogue of 
chicken-based products available from Pierce Foods -- a leading supplier of 
pre-cooked menu items to the food service industry -- offers well over 200 
variations on the theme. There's Hume Dingher's 39 Seasonings Fast-Fry chicken, 
for instance ("Leave it to Hume to pack 39 herbs and spices, sea salts, and 
vegetables into one chicken recipe"). Or Greek Odyssey Chicken Breast Fillets 
("IT'S MICROWAVEABLE!"). Or Marinata Americana Chicken Thigh Fillets ("Here is 
a chicken fillet with a touch of greatness -- a lighter blend of those Central 
and Southern European spices America loves best"). 
</P>
<P>
Other varieties of Pierce poulet include Marinata/LS (Low Sodium) Curried Brest 
(sic), Microwaveable Wing-Dings, Roman-Fingers, Dip'n Chik'n Nuggets, Taste 
O'Mesquite Whole Halves (sic), Chik-Nachos and both Whirligigs and Whirlibirds 
(the latter, of course, being "Fully cooked, breaded chicken breast-and-thigh 
meat patties . . . seasoned with sage and onion croutons"). 
</P>
<P>
It's nice to know that somebody like Pierce is out there making the 
restaurateur's life easier, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
READ MY LICKS: What will (gulp) President Bush and Vice-President Quayle be 
eating on the evening of Inauguration Day? Hearts-of-palm blossoms, 
asiago-garlic bread and pheasant pizza, among other things. They'll be sampling 
these and other exotic delicacies at a reception in a new restaurant in the 
nation's capital called Adirondacks. Adirondacks, which is the work of L.A.'s 
own Michael McCarty (of Michael's in Santa Monica) and chef Jimmy Schmidt -- 
who also own the Rattlesnake Clubs in Denver and Detroit -- is an appropriate 
site for a presidential reception, as it happens, since it occupies the old 
presidential suite at Washington's Union Station, built for the use of Teddy 
Roosevelt. (Adirondacks was originally going to be yet another Rattlesnake 
Club, incidentally, but McCarty and Schmidt felt that an East-coast sort of 
name would be more appropriate. Personally, I think the Rattlesnake Club is a 
great name for a restaurant a few blocks from Capitol Hill.) 
</P>
<P>
"We're just going to serve wild hors d'oeuvres," says Schmidt. "You know those 
politician types. They like to stay on their feet and pump a lot of hands. 
They'll probably be so busy talking that they'll only take little bites of 
things -- so I've got to get my licks in quick." 
</P>
<P>
Among those licks will be spicy shrimp with achiote and picaya (hearts-of-palm 
blossoms) on lemon-bread croutons, asiago-garlic bread with black and green 
olive tapenade, and that pheasant pizza with the addition of Chinese-style plum 
sauce, hot mustard and mozzarella. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, wait a minute. Isn't Bush the guy who made fun of Michael Dukakis for 
talking about Belgian endive? 
</P>
<P>
SALT AND PEPPER: Cafe Prego is new on La Cienega, on the site of the former 
L'Angolo (among other restaurants). . . . Marc Ehrler, former chef for the 
French ambassador in Washington, is the new executive chef at the San Ysidro 
Ranch in Montecito. Ehrler replaces Bryan Carr, who has moved to the El Encanto 
Hotel in Santa Barbara. . . .

I find it very disappointing that The Times would refer to someone as 
close-minded and ridiculous as Tracey Ullman as a "tastemaker" (Taste Makers, 
Dec. 25). 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who lives, (and very well I might add!) in this city and feels that 
theater here does not merit her very valuable time has not looked very far. I'm 
sure that Ms. Ullman could find something to satisfy her superior taste. 
</P>
<P>
If she finds Los Angeles and this country in fact to be a cultural or artistic 
desert, then perhaps she should move back to London and have her tea there, or 
would that hit here where it hurts, her pocketbook!

STENCILING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH SIMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUDDENLY POPULAR after nearly a century of neglect, stencil painting now 
decorates nursery walls and furniture, living and dining room walls and floors. 
Stenciling became prominent in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, when it 
was used to imitate wallpaper. In the American colonies, stenciled designs were 
used on floors, on furniture and on canvas or oilcloth floor coverings. 
</P>
<P>
The process is simple: A stenciler, using a craft knife, cuts various shapes in 
a piece of sturdy, usually waxed, paper, and then applies paint to a surface 
through those cutouts. The beauty of stenciling is the ease of repetition: 
Complicated swag-and-bouquet borders can be applied to walls in a fraction of 
the time (and without the requisite talent) it would take someone to paint them 
by hand. Stenciling can be a very satisfying craft, because the end result, 
when done well, looks professionally neat and precise. 
</P>
<P>
Although stenciling is easy enough to attempt on your own -- with just some 
paper, a craft knife, paint and brushes -- a small test project before 
launching into a total-room experience is a good idea. The hardest thing to 
master is the correct consistency of the paint. Think dry. And the stencil 
brush (shaped like a blunt, long-handled shaving brush) should be wielded with 
an up-and-down motion; wiping brings disaster. The surface to be stenciled 
determines the consistency of the paint; cloth can take more paint on the 
brush, but a floor previously painted with something like diamond-hard deck 
enamel will resist all paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Many how-to books on stenciling have been published; Dover Books has issued a 
series of books of stencil designs on thick paper, ready for cutting. 
Stenciling supplies and classes are offered at Judy's Carousel Crafts and 
Rainbow Craft, both in Burbank, and at Craf-T-Mac's in La Habra. Supplies are 
available at Aaron Bros. stores, Kit Kraft in Studio City, Stat's in Pasadena, 
and Michael's in Torrance. UCLA Extension plans to offer a stenciling class in 
the spring quarter.

DAT AND LUDDITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding John C. Dvorak's Dec. 11 Viewpoints column, "Why DAT Isn't 
Un-American": 
</P>
<P>
I must agree with Dvorak. It is not digital audio tape that is un-American, but 
rather the Recording Industry Assn. of America itself. 
</P>
<P>
The attitudes and actions of the RIAA very closely parallel those of the 
Luddites, the early 19th-Century English workmen who destroyed labor-saving 
machinery to "protect" the economy. The Luddites could not see that if textiles 
could be more easily manufactured and sold for less, more people could afford 
more of them. 
</P>
<P>
In the same way, the RIAA was wrong about standard audio cassettes, wrong about 
videocassette recorders and now also wrong about DAT. Audio cassettes boosted 
sales of long-playing records, and VCRs boosted motion picture revenues. The 
RIAA would like to punish the entire country for the supposed wrongs of the 
proverbial bootlegging pirates. This is not only unfair but ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
The RIAA's special-interest politicking may have hurt the introduction of DAT, 
but it won't be able to stop read/write compact discs. Everything seems to be 
going digital. It's just a matter of time.

'89 WISH LIST: PROTECTION, TAXES AND PEACE; 
</P>
<P>
SOCIAL BENEFITS, DEFICIT REDUCTION ARE TOP PRIORITIES FOR THE NEW YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What changes would you like to see in business practices and the workplace this 
year? How can business leaders and economic policy-makers improve the economy 
and the world in general in 1989? The Times ran these questions by people in 
various walks of life, and here are some of their answers: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Muriel Siebert, head of the Muriel Siebert &amp; Co. discount brokerage in New 
York, and first female member of the New York Stock Exchange: 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see certain business practices regulated. I think that the 
leveraged buyouts show the greed of people at their worst. . . . The LBOs are 
bypassing the purpose of the capital-raising system. I think that to the extent 
that people were stockholders in these companies . . . they should be allowed 
to continue to have some kind of share in the profits (after the leveraged 
buyouts) because these moves were done while they were stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
"Must greed be the creed? I would like to see that also rolled over to our 
defense contractors. I am pro defense. I believe in a strong country because 
people mistake gentility for weakness. If (contractors) cheat on defense 
contracts, I don't see why they don't go to jail. . . . I just feel that if you 
are a major defense contractor, you owe a fiduciary responsibility to this 
country because defense expenditures are putting a pretty big toll on the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Brimmer, former member of the Federal Reserve Board and head of a 
Washington economics consulting firm: 
</P>
<P>
"My leading wish is that the nation deal with the federal budget deficit. I 
would like to see a substantial reduction in 1989 and extending over the next 
three years. I would strongly recommend that we raise taxes. There should be 
some moderation in the level of government expenditures, but the real problem 
is the lag in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"I also would like to see more done for education by business. The kind of 
education I'm talking about is at the elementary and secondary level. 
Businesses are already contributing to colleges. Businesses should do likewise 
for elementary and secondary schools. Business people can play a role as 
counselors and teachers. A firm might make available an engineer or 
mathematician to go into schools and teach. Business should do more to offer 
on-the-job training for unskilled, or limited-skills, people, perhaps through a 
(lower) learning wage. We would give business tax credits to do this." 
</P>
<P>
William R. Robertson, executive secretary of the Los Angeles County Federation 
of Labor, AFL-CIO: 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see a change in philosophy by the incoming President relating 
to labor relations and providing for fairness in our (labor) organizing efforts 
and contract negotiations. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I would also like to see some protection for workers losing their jobs because 
of mergers. It is a national disgrace. In too many mergers, the workers are the 
ones that suffer and the country as well. Something should be done to correct 
it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And, finally, this Administration should face reality in resolving the 
astronomical deficit." 
</P>
<P>
Steven D. Lydenberg, an associate with the "socially responsible" investment 
firm of Franklin Research &amp; Development: 
</P>
<P>
"There is an increasing interest around the country in social investing. People 
want to know not just the financial implications of making a commitment in a 
company, but also the social implication. That information is not very easy to 
come by. 
</P>
<P>
"So, if at the end of '89 corporations were disclosing in a uniform way their 
yield figures, their charitable contribution figures, the numbers of women and 
minorities in top management and board directors, their attitude on a number of 
comparable social issues, I would be very happy." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Borman, chairman of Patlex Corp. of Chatsworth, former astronaut and 
former chairman of Eastern Airlines: 
</P>
<P>
"We should begin to move toward taxing consumption -- a value-added tax. This 
is quite controversial as Al Ullman (Oregon Democrat and former chairman of the 
House Ways and Means Committee, who was defeated in 1988 after advocating a 
value-added tax) will tell you. But this taxing system is needed. It would 
certainly help our exports. Almost all of Europe is under the value-added 
taxing system. Also, it may encourage saving instead of consumption. One of the 
ways you discourage consumption is to tax it." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Harrington, co-chair of Democratic Socialists of America and author of 
"The Other America" and "The New American Poverty": 
</P>
<P>
"I hope Secretary of State Baker will build on the basic insights of former 
Treasury Secretary Baker (James Baker, former treasury secretary, was nominated 
by President-elect Bush to be Secretary of State) that a settlement of Third 
World debt is in the self-interest of America, opening up markets for business 
and labor. But then the new Baker will have to go far beyond the old, since 
Latin America now owes more than it did in 1982 when the crisis officially 
began, and several countries, including Argentina and Brazil, may see democracy 
subverted if current trends persist. 
</P>
<P>
"At home, the nation must recognize that we can't waste young people, and 
particularly minorities and women, on illiteracy, unemployment and unproductive 
low-wage work. We must invest mightily in education, training and job 
generation." 
</P>
<P>
Alan Bromberg, a securities law expert and professor at Southern Methodist 
University: 
</P>
<P>
"There are several things I would like most to see changed in the economy and 
business practices. One, more concentration by business and government, both 
here and abroad, on . . . the facilitation of international trade and 
investment. This would require wider horizons for business people . . . and 
more effort by government to reduce and ultimately eliminate all kinds of 
restrictions on the movement of products. 
</P>
<P>
"Two, I would like to see a national consensus developed, preferably in the 
form of federal legislation, on corporate takeovers and buyouts that would 
recognize the efficiencies and benefits they bring as well as the dislocations 
and hardships they can cause. This would involve tax policies and labor polices 
and limitations on the ability of states to Balkanize corporate law by 
different anti-takeover statutes everywhere. (There also should be) some kind 
of limitation on management self-entrenchment and self-enrichment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we could use a lot of clarification of the securities laws. I think 
the courts have done a good job of saying what insider trading is. The kind of 
issues that are most difficult are what really is parking (of stock)? How much 
cooperation or similar action by different individuals or different groups of 
individuals makes it collaboration? These issues haven't been well resolved. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Peter Bahouth, executive director of Greenpeace in Washington: 
</P>
<P>
"People now view threats to human security less in terms of political threats 
and more in environmental and economic terms. So for my wish list, I would ask 
first that we deal with the issue of the greenhouse effect. We better develop 
some alternative views in mass transportation and cut subsidies to reflect the 
true cost of fossil fuels in terms of pollution, along with the actual economic 
cost of development. Then, we could put more money into research and 
development of wind and solar energy. 
</P>
<P>
"(Also on my wish list is) peace on earth. If we want peace on earth, we have 
to start looking seriously at the fact that we are making more and more 
weapons, and in a process which endangers the health of American people. . . . 
Production plants have been proven to have released into the air and water 
radioactivity and toxic chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
"Also, it would be nice if we could learn that the rain forest affects all of 
us. We need to preserve it. And we would like the tuna industry to stop killing 
dolphins."

MEDIAN HOME PRICES, SALES UP IN NOVEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Median prices and sales of resale detached houses and condominiums rose in 
November, according to the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
November sales of detached houses in California rose 4.9% over October, thanks 
to a brief dip in interest rates and strong demand. 
</P>
<P>
Detached houses sold at an annual rate of 597,000 in November compared to 
569,330 in October. The November figure was 17% higher than last November 
making it the highest in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The state's median sales price for resale houses rose 1.2% in November to 
$177,485. This was a 23.6% jump from November, 1987, when the median was 
$143,554. Joel Singer, chief economist of the realtors' group, said lack of 
inventory helped to cause the price rise. 
</P>
<P>
Condominium resales rose 0.2% over October but 48.4% over November, 1987. The 
median condominium price fell 2.7%, to $126,328 in November from $129,869 in 
October. Even so, November's median price was 10.4% higher than a year ago, 
when it was $114,457.

INTERIOR DESIGN IMPORTANT TO VISUALLY IMPAIRED PERSONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Interior design can have more impact on the visually impaired than on those who 
see normally, according Jean Bast of the San Diego chapter of the American 
Society of Interior Designers. 
</P>
<P>
Chapter members have been volunteering their services to redesigning and 
renovating the San Diego Service Center for the Blind, using techniques and 
design applications that will transform it into an integrated "way-finding" 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
Most furnishings are also being donated to the $500,000 renovation of the 
8,000-square-foot center. Design applications will include the use of brightly 
colored accents on walls and floors, improved overhead lighting to reduce 
glare, lighting in handrails and heavily textured walls, said Jan Bast, the 
chairman of the ASID design team. 
</P>
<P>
"To call this a center for the blind is somewhat a misnomer, since most of the 
people utilizing the center are partially sighted," Bast added. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80% of the 2,200 people using the San Diego facility are elderly, and 
design efforts have also gone into special furnishings for that group. For the 
totally blind, different, heavily textured wall coverings and varying floor 
surfaces will enhance their ability to find their way.

THE BUSH YEARS: 1;

<P>
PAYING FOR THE REAGAN REVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By William Schneider, William Schneider is a contributing editor to Opinion.

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two predictions for 1989: There isn't going to be a Bush Revolution. But George 
Bush will have to pay the price for the Reagan Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
We know there won't be a Bush Revolution because, with one exception, none of 
the people Bush has appointed to policy-making positions is a revolutionary. 
They are in the mold of Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III, who 
was reviled by conservatives when he was Ronald Reagan's chief of staff; Atty. 
Gen. Richard Thornburgh, who has served in the Nixon, Ford and Reagan 
administrations; Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who is closer to Wall 
Street than to the supply-siders on the Republican right, and Brent Scowcroft, 
Bush's national security adviser, who is known to harbor serious doubts about 
Reagan's "Star Wars" program. In other words, Bush has assembled a team of 
cautious, moderate, pragmatic, Establishment Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
The one exception is Jack Kemp, Bush's proposed secretary of housing and urban 
development. Kemp has never held an executive position before, and he is 
brimming over with radical new ideas. Kemp's is regarded as a token appointment 
to a secondary Cabinet position, however, made to mollify the GOP's right wing. 
(Quiz: Who is Reagan's secretary of housing and urban development? Hint: He is 
the only Cabinet member who served for Reagan's entire two terms. Give up? 
Here's another hint: He is the only black in Reagan's Cabinet. Still stumped? 
The answer is Samuel R. Pierce Jr. If you didn't know, don't worry. Reagan 
himself didn't recognize Pierce at a White House reception several years ago.) 
</P>
<P>
Actually, radical new ideas are what is needed for dealing with the major 
problem under Kemp's purview, namely, the national scandal of homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
Other than Kemp, the only controversial appointments Bush has made were to 
political rather than policy-making positions -- John H. Sununu as White House 
chief of staff, Lee Atwater as Republican Party chairman and Dan Quayle as vice 
president. None has to be confirmed by the Senate. And the Bush people are 
still trying to figure out something for Quayle to do. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, when it comes to policy positions, there are no James P. Watts, no 
William J. Caseys, no Edwin Meese IIIs, no William J. Bennetts. The Reagan 
Administration gave us bold new ideas. The Bush Administration will give us 
something we rarely got from Reagan -- professionalism. 
</P>
<P>
Congress seems impressed by Bush's professionalism. Even Democrats express 
admiration for the professionalism of his presidential campaign. "It was a 
nasty campaign," said House Majority Whip Tony Coelho (D-Merced), "but 
basically it was a professional campaign. They knew what had to be done and 
they did it." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, we are in one of the rare periods of make-nice in Washington. Bush's 
efforts to bind up the wounds of the campaign are paying off. He has bought 
himself a honeymoon. Conservatives are holding their fire; they don't want to 
be seen as abandoning the new President before he even takes office. The press 
is happy because the President-elect has held more press conferences this year 
than the President. 
</P>
<P>
Congress and Bush are engaged in an elaborate Alphonse-and-Gaston routine. Each 
side expresses great admiration for the other. One says, "Oh please, you be the 
first to reveal your budget plans." "Oh no, I couldn't possibly," says the 
other. "Please, you go first." As in the court of the Sun King at Versailles, 
the ritual courtesy masks a deadly clash of ambitions. Each side wants to seize 
the dagger and drive it into the other's heart. 
</P>
<P>
Taxes are the dagger. He who proposes new taxes gets it in the neck. As Sen. 
John Breaux (D-La.), the new chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign 
Committee, put it, "Bush is the one who laid down the gauntlet -- read my lips, 
no new taxes. If we go out and break his promise for him, we get the blame for 
it and he gets the credit. No one wants to fall into that trap." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, as soon as the deficit comes up, the honeymoon ends. It will be 
hard for Bush to do what Reagan has done for the last eight years, namely, 
pretend the deficit is not his problem. 
</P>
<P>
Bush will also pay the price for Reagan's foreign policy. In this case, a break 
with the Republican right is inevitable. The right always resented the fact 
that Reagan abandoned his "evil empire" agenda in order to pursue arms control 
and detente. They dared not protest, however. "Reagan could always go over our 
heads to our own people at the grass roots," said conservative activist Paul 
Weyrich. "Bush won't be able to do that. He needs us." Bush and Scowcroft do 
not show much enthusiasm for "Star Wars." Bush and Baker have decided to 
postpone asking Congress for new military aid to the Contras. The Reagan 
Administration, with Bush's full support, has begun talking to the Palestine 
Liberation Organization. Some time this year, conservatives are going to say, 
"Enough!" 
</P>
<P>
Bush will also pay the price for Reagan's social agenda. Here the break will be 
not with Congress or the GOP right, but with the American public. It will 
happen as soon as the Supreme Court reverses its historic 1973 Roe vs. Wade 
decision that defined abortion as a constitutionally protected human right. 
Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who wrote Roe vs. Wade, has warned that abortion 
rights may soon "go down the drain." Four of the nine current Supreme Court 
justices want to overturn the Roe decision, and three of Roe's supporters are 
in their 80s. 
</P>
<P>
Roe will go. And when that happens, all hell will break loose. "Taking away 
rights that have already been given is a hard thing to pull off," said Kate 
Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League. 
Millions of American women have had abortions. Despite increased restrictions, 
the abortion rate has remained steady at 1.5 million a year during the Reagan 
years. A decision recriminalizing abortion will be as divisive for Republicans 
as the 1954 school desegregation decision was for Democrats. Reagan was lucky. 
He demanded an end to abortions but it didn't happen on his watch. Bush won't 
be so lucky.

MIXING SIGNALS ON CAPITOL GRIDLOCK

Go-o-o-d morning, Sacramento! Californians have some New Year's resolutions to 
propose: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Balance Proposition 103's attack on soaring insurance premiums with curbs 
on claim costs and attorney fees. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Take responsibility for restructuring the Gann spending limit to fit 
current budget realities and quit bucking tough fiscal decisions to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Address the issues raised by the FBI sting, initiative mania and the 
Speakership wars by a comprehensive approach to government reform and not 
merely cosmetic tinkering. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Face the critical questions of what the quality of life in California 
should be and who should pay for it -- and stop ducking complex issues like 
health care, the environment, toxics, transportation, growth controls and 
regional government. 
</P>
<P>
How realistic are these resolutions? That's not easy to predict. Because what 
happens in Sacramento in 1989 will depend primarily on Gov. George Deukmejian, 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and the onslaught of reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's decision whether or not to seek reelection will influence policy 
direction. Will he be persuaded to run by advisers who argue he has the best 
chance to keep the governor's chair Republican and thus prevent a Democratic 
gerrymander in the 1991 reapportionment? 
</P>
<P>
Or, looking toward retirement, will he opt to abandon his stubborn naysaying 
and attempt to build a legacy? 
</P>
<P>
Early signals are mixed. After mellowing on Gann limit revisions, he's again 
mulling wholesale budget chopping. 
</P>
<P>
The pledge that Speaker Brown recently made to ease up on politicking and 
concentrate on policy-making could also help chart a positive course for state 
government. Again, signals are mixed -- in view of the partisan sniping at 
Deukmejian's nominee for state treasurer by Brown's lieutenants. 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker's definition of "doing policy" is crucial. Policy-making is not 
selectively taking over legislators' bills and ramming them through the 
Assembly. A "boutique" approach to problem-solving is not leadership. 
</P>
<P>
A leader allows lawmakers to nurture their own programs, and then protects 
their bills through the entire Legislature and the governor's office, too. He 
stands up to special interests who fund legislative campaigns and then stymie 
legislative action. (In 1989, the real test will be if Brown opposes the 
state's trial lawyers, key political supporters, for enactment of comprehensive 
insurance reform.) 
</P>
<P>
But the strongest influence may be reapportionment. To make policy, legislators 
have to get elected, and governors need legislative majorities of their own 
party. 
</P>
<P>
Will Assembly Republicans, led by their confrontational leader, Ross Johnson of 
La Habra, frustrate policy through partisan, obstructionist games designed to 
wound the Democratic majority before reapportionment? 
</P>
<P>
Will dissident legislative Democrats quiet down in exchange for a "kinder, 
gentler" redistricting? 
</P>
<P>
Will incumbents and leaders of both parties opt to play it safe -- and not risk 
any new policy initiatives before reapportionment can assure their continued 
political survival? 
</P>
<P>
Who can predict whether 1989 will bring an end to Sacramento's political 
gridlock? The denizens of the state Capitol might prefer to hibernate until 
reapportionment season. But perhaps, as Assemblyman Richard Katz of Sepulveda 
speculated, "If more solutions don't start coming out of this place, then no 
one will be around for reapportionment." 
</P>
<P>
If this prediction doesn't stir some resolve in Sacramento, nothing will.

ITALY DEBATES A CAPITAL IDEA -- DOWN WITH ROME! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By George Armstrong, George Armstrong is the Rome correspondent for Britain's 
Guardian newspaper. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ROME 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Was the decision to make Rome the capital of Italy, taken in the last century, 
a mistake even bigger than the Colosseum itself? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, says Luigi Firpo, a history professor at Turin University and one of the 
luminaries among Italian intelligentsia. His opinion has probably been held by 
millions of other Italians since Rome actually became the Italian capital in 
1870. It is an opinion likely to gain adherents in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Many Romans, or those who call themselves Romans, agree that the Eternal City 
seems each day less likely to hold on to that defiant label much longer. For 
them, Rome entered an alarming new chapter around AD 1950, the year when 
everyone who could switched from bicycles to cars, and folks flocked in from 
the hills to join the Roman circus. 
</P>
<P>
Firpo, who now also sits in Parliament, has said that the degradation of Rome 
is total. The Romans are vulgar, arrogant and ignorant, he claims, and the city 
"does not deserve to be the capital." For him, Rome is "the only Levantine city 
without a European quarter." 
</P>
<P>
His remarks, uttered first in Parliament then repeated and expanded in 
interviews, brought a denial from his political party that he was speaking for 
them, and then angry words from the city's political bosses. Some of their 
responses were impoverished, falling back on the line that Rome was the natural 
capital because it once had been the capital of the Western World. 
</P>
<P>
This, Firpo said, was "imperial rhetoric." Harking back to the empire was also 
one of Benito Mussolini's gambits, when the Italian dictator was playing from 
his balcony to cheering Roman crowds. Mussolini spoke of his Rome as being the 
city's third incarnation. First, the Rome of the Caesars, then the Rome of the 
Popes and finally the Rome of his glorious new Fascist regime. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Metternich, the 19th-Century Austrian statesman, dismissed the Italy of 
his time as being "more a geographical expression than a country." A little 
later, Firpo's native Piedmont, the northwestern Italian region that borders 
Switzerland and France, produced a handful of noblemen who thought that Italy 
should become a unified nation for the first time since the fall of the Roman 
Empire. In 1861 the Piedmontese Parliament declared that one day Rome would be 
the new Italian capital. The rest of the country was then under foreign 
domination; Rome and other parts of Italy were ruled by the Pope. 
</P>
<P>
When the Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed in Turin, one unification supporter, 
the Marquis Massimo D'Azeglio, said, "We've created an Italy -- now we must 
create the Italians." A strong argument could be made that his second goal is 
still a long way off. 
</P>
<P>
To relieve the Pope of his temporal powers, the Piedmontese entered Rome on 
Sept. 20, 1870, set up their king in what until the day before had been the 
Pope's residence and found themselves in possession of a city of fewer than 
200,000 people, living in a poverty unknown elsewhere on the Italian peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Today Rome's official population is 3 million, but each day it continues to 
attract migrants from hill towns and farms, drawn like moths to the bright 
lights. They soon find themselves living in shantytowns on the outskirts, 
without electricity or even plumbing. The arches of Roman aqueducts, built 
2,000 years ago to supply water for Nero's baths, are now bricked up by 
migrants and serve as dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
A cover story on a feisty Italian weekly, Espresso, some time ago was titled, 
"When the Capital Is Corrupt -- the Nation Is Infected." That was, and probably 
is, the attitude of Milan or any other modern metropolitan area in northern 
Italy toward the nation's capital. Each year the northern regions see their tax 
payments shipped to Rome for distribution in favor of southern Italy, an area 
just as rich in natural resources as the north and with double the 
unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
Alberto Moravia, the dean of Italian novelists, now a spry 83, is a Rome 
native. He was one of the first to jump on Firpo for his remarks, reminding him 
that when the Piedmontese entered Rome, they demolished many splendid buildings 
and private gardens to make Rome "more modern." A few days later, Moravia 
recalled that he himself had written against Rome a few years back and offered 
proof that Firpo was not all that original in his thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
Moravia had said: "Rome is not worthy of the name of being a European capital, 
like Paris or London. It is not a model for the nation to follow, but a sterile 
bureaucratic sponge that absorbs everything and gives nothing. Though the 
center of the church, it is the world's least spiritual city. Religion is 
present more with its bureaucracy than with its sentiment . . . . There is no 
circulation of ideas and persons in Rome, meaning there is no society of 
either." 
</P>
<P>
When Firpo was asked where he would prefer to have the Italian capital, he 
said, "Somewhere near Chiusi, but in open country." Both he and Moravia agree 
that Chiusi -- an old Etruscan town midway between Rome and Florence -- is only 
their utopian dream. It is too late for an Italian Pretoria, Canberra, Brasilia 
or Washington, even though with their cars, Italy's central government and the 
entire elephantine bureaucracy are destroying the remains of both ancient and 
modern Rome with a wanton thoroughness that would give pause to Attila the Hun. 
</P>
<P>
If it had not been deemed necessary to dislodge the Pope from his temporal 
control over Rome, some of the Piedmontese were touting Naples as the nation's 
capital. It was, after all, the largest Italian city and still a major cultural 
influence in Europe. However, the Sicilians said they would never again accept 
Naples as a sovereign seat. 
</P>
<P>
What a pity. The Neapolitans have been living by their wits for centuries. They 
are clever about inventing jobs and pulling rabbits out of other peoples' hats. 
They are nimble, too, as people who choose to live under a smoldering volcano 
need to be. They have produced great painters, poets, composers, writers, 
architects -- while Rome has failed to produce even one. 
</P>
<P>
Had Naples become the Italian capital 100 years ago, it would have tilted the 
scale in favor of the Italian peninsula becoming a Mediterranean country, not 
what it is now -- an angry mix, half-European and half-Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
That is what Luigi Firpo's rage against Rome is all about. He spoke for 
millions of Italians who consider themselves European, and, incidentally, 
probably spoke also for foreign Europeans who must do business in Italy and who 
find themselves beating their heads against the city's bureaucratic rubber 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
The only way out of this Italian dilemma is for the north to secede from the 
union. Both sides would be winners.

NICARAGUA STRUGGLES TO AID ITS CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Harry Nelson, Harry Nelson, a former health and medical writer for The 
Times, specializes in Third World health issues. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MANAGUA, NICARAGUA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight years of socially and economically devastating war with U.S.-backed 
Contra forces -- topped off 10 weeks ago by the most destructive hurricane in 
decades -- have sucked much of the substance but not the spirit from 
Nicaragua's 3.6 million people. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago Nicaraguans talked enthusiastically of government campaigns to 
reduce infant mortality, eradicate malaria, distribute land to the landless and 
wipe out illiteracy. 
</P>
<P>
For a while great strides were made toward realizing those goals. But today, 
for the first time since the revolution that overthrew dictator Anastasio 
Somoza in 1979, children beg on the streets as government officials reluctantly 
slash health programs that once drew international praise. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to help hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguan children who have been 
displaced, wounded, orphaned or otherwise traumatized by the Contra war, the 
U.S. Congress appropriated $17.7 million. Two days after President Reagan 
signed the bill on Oct. 1, President Daniel Ortega said Nicaragua would not 
accept the money. 
</P>
<P>
To Nicaraguans, refusing the aid was a symbol of dignity and national pride. 
Tied to the legislation was a second bill that provided a similar amount in 
non-lethal aid to the Contras, the very forces whose attacks on civilian 
outposts were -- and still are -- responsible for the misery of many children. 
</P>
<P>
For Nicaragua to have accepted the aid, said Paul Oquist, an adviser to Ortega, 
would be comparable to the United States having accepted a donation of blood 
from Japan following the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. wants to help children, lift the trade embargo and stop the war," 
he said. "That would stop the production of orphans and allow more (Nicaraguan) 
resources to deal with the problem ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the Sandinistas say the party's bungling management of the economy 
is the real reason for its desperate straights. They accuse the Sandinistas of 
torpedoing peace efforts with the Contras, suppressing the opposition press, 
squelching political dissent and endlessly confounding friend and foe alike 
with contradictory actions. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, representatives of U.S. and foreign relief agencies based here 
and even mothers who have lost sons in the war say they supported Ortega's 
action. 
</P>
<P>
A summary of the immense effects of the war on children appears in a 
little-publicized report prepared last summer by a team of American health 
professionals sent to Nicaragua on behalf of the U.S. Agency for International 
Development to assess children's needs. Among their findings, gleaned from 
interviews with 40 humanitarian agencies working here and with the Nicaraguan 
government: 
</P>
<P>
 -- About 500,000 of the nation's 1.8 million children under age 17 have been 
directly affected through destruction or disruption of schools and other 
services, displacement from homes, death of parents, injuries and psychological 
trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At least 455 children under 15 years have been killed and 691 are missing 
through the end of 1987. Another 1,542 under 15 have been wounded, with an 
additional 1,865 wounded among youngsters aged 15 through 20. About 1,200 have 
experienced serious physical handicaps such as amputations and 568 children 
have lost both parents, while 138 lost mothers and 9,371 lost fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- As many as 50,000 children have suffered psychological trauma after seeing 
their villages shot up, parents or neighbors killed and having been forced to 
resettle in strange areas. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the cease-fire treaty of last spring, attacks on farm cooperatives and 
killing and wounding of children continue. In October, in the province of 
Jinotega, a well-marked Red Cross ambulance was shot up by Contras and one 
passenger was wounded. The Contras also attacked a civilian truck, killing nine 
civilians, three of them women. Two children injured in the attack later died. 
Four civilians were killed in an attack in another province that occurred only 
hours before Hurricane Joan struck on Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Two American physicians, Tim Takaro and Susan Cookson, who have worked for two 
years in the Jinotega war zone, said $300,000 of the U.S. aid had been slated 
for treating intestinal parasites in 30,000 children in their region. But 
conditions imposed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, which 
administers such aid funding, would have undermined the existing health system 
in Nicaragua, they said. 
</P>
<P>
AID requires that any private agency receiving federal funds have no connection 
with the Nicaraguan Health Ministry. Yet Takaro, Cookson and other U.S. health 
workers here agree that all private agencies working in health cooperate with 
the government system because that is the most efficient and economical way to 
get services to the people. 
</P>
<P>
One of the Health Ministry's goals since the 1979 revolution has been to expand 
health centers in rural areas. The policy saved many lives during the Contra 
conflict. Last summer's report by the American team on the needs of children 
noted with some surprise that the primary medical and social needs of most 
war-injured and orphaned children had already been cared for within government 
facilities. Most who required specialized care not available in Nicaragua were 
sent to Eastern Bloc countries, it said. Several Health Ministry doctors said 
there has been great difficulty arranging for specialized care in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The priority need now, the report said, is for continuing rehabilitation within 
the children's own homes. 
</P>
<P>
All U.S. federal aid to Nicaragua was suspended in 1981. Some of the slack has 
been taken up by U.S. allies, including Canada, Sweden, Holland, Italy, France, 
Spain and other European countries who have contributed hundreds of millions of 
dollars in medical supplies and assistance. Health Ministry officials said the 
severe strains on the economy have forced them to charge for certain health 
services that were previously free. 
</P>
<P>
Health workers have also been victims of Contra attacks. So far this year, 
according to Takaro and Cookson, two volunteer Nicaraguan health workers 
(brigadistas) have been killed in Jinotega province alone, eight have been 
kidnaped and three are missing. 
</P>
<P>
Because brigadistas live in communities where there is usually no doctor or 
nurse, their services are highly valued. 
</P>
<P>
"They are hard to replace when killed because others become too frightened to 
volunteer," Cookson said. "Eight health centers have been attacked by Contras 
in Jinotega this year. Some were destroyed and the medicine supplies were 
always destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Joan added to the general misery because of the destruction of crops, 
homes, roads, bridges and service centers totaling $828 million, according to 
the Social Welfare Ministry. Officials predict severe food shortages beginning 
in the spring as a result of ruined bean and corn crops. The ministry has 
called for $16.1 million in aid to clothe and feed for six months the 118,000 
children whose lives were disrupted by the hurricane.

ISRAELI COALITION AND ARAFAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For once, before offering such generous but the unasked for advice, put 
yourselves in Israel's place (editorial, "Israel: Starting Over," Dec. 21). The 
tiny country is surrounded by vicious enemies, who not only hate the Jewish 
state (as well as other non-Arab entities in the area: the Kurds, the Copts, 
the Armenians, etc.) but also each other. 
</P>
<P>
Who has Israel to talk to? The cowardly Jordanian monarch? Egypt, a country 
rocked by pro-Khomeini unrest, whose population has never accepted peace with 
Israel, and whose armed forces are being mindlessly and continuously 
strengthened by Western states? Iraq, Syria, Lybia -- all of whom control the 
Palestine Liberation Organization? 
</P>
<P>
Why is it that The Times does not urge totalitarian Arab states and terrorist 
organizations to put down their weapons, and stop all provocations? And what of 
"an international peace meeting?" 
</P>
<P>
Who will decide the future of Israel, who will guarantee its existence? 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, an archaic colonial empire, whose unity is cemented by tanks 
and the blood of martyred White Russians, Ukrainians, Afghans, and the Balts? 
The United States, whose loyalty to its allies can be eloquently witnessed to 
by the late Shah of Iran, the betrayed anti-Castro Cubans of the Bay of Pigs, 
the Contras, the South Vietnamese? Or maybe pro-Arab France and Greece will 
guarantee Israel's right to exist? 
</P>
<P>
Israel has no choice but to forge a strong coalition, maintain a unity 
government, strengthen itself, and realize that in this world nobody can 
guarantee anything. The best Israel will get, if it depends on such generous 
advice, as The Times has given it, is a motion picture about its destruction. 
We will all cry and wonder why the second Holocaust was allowed. 
</P>
<P>
If the Israeli government decides to build Jewish settlements in the historic 
Jewish land, then it must do so -- without waiting for advice from a slanted 
and biased American media, whose news reporters eagerly write "Israeli-occupied 
West Bank," but never write "Soviet-occupied Estonia," or "provocative Arab 
plans for the destruction of Israel."

FIXING THE WRONG THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the two national political parties begin working together to make things 
"better," better beware. During the last campaign, Democrats and Republicans 
formed a commission to grab sponsorship of the last presidential debate away 
from the League of Women Voters. The result was that the two presidential 
campaigns were able to dictate ground rules that resulted not in a real debate 
but in an excessively restricted and programmed question-answer session. 
</P>
<P>
Now the parties have joined in a new bipartisan commission to do something 
about the national political conventions. The commission has been directed to 
propose ways of streamlining the conventions so that they are more appealing to 
Americans on television. This is in obvious response to the poor ratings that 
the conventions drew last summer and to network television's reluctance to 
carry the entire proceedings. Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., the retiring Republican 
national chairman, said that there had been criticism from the media that the 
conventions "have become nothing more than staged activities in which nominees 
give canned speeches." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that this dog is barking up the wrong tree. What needs fixing is 
the pre-convention nominating process that goes on forever and produces winners 
long before the delegates gather. The prospective nominees thus have control of 
the convention program and arrange things so that there is a minimum of 
uncertainty and controversy. This year even the names of the vice presidential 
running mates were known in advance, so the conventions were robbed of any 
remaining tidbit of suspense. 
</P>
<P>
What the national parties must do is shorten the primary campaign and start it 
someplace other than Iowa or New Hampshire. They need to be willing to have 
actual issues debated on the convention floor. They need some spontaneity and 
real action -- perhaps even a multiple roll-call contest for the nomination. 
They do not need more programming, but less. Fix the primary process, and the 
convention problem will fix itself.

VERBAL VIRUS

A brilliant hacker at Cornell University recently taught us how much damage a 
computer virus can do to communications' nervous systems, but we had long known 
that terminal disease has an electronic application. More troubling, perhaps 
because more human, is a language virus, transmitted orally or on paper, that 
spreads and replicates until meaning itself is destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The term sea-change, for example, surges through the media these days, usually 
suggesting something mammoth -- as a sea-change in Soviet politics or a 
sea-change in Sean Penn's police relations. The original usage was 
Shakespeare's, and the bard was literally suggesting what the sea could do to a 
human body. Only in 1988 did a tidal wave of sea-changes cover the land as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Arguably is, arguably, the latest fad in suggesting uncertainty. The trouble is 
the way it appears everywhere and may confuse -- should be argued or may be 
argued -- even as it hedges. 
</P>
<P>
A learned editor in this neighborhood has decided to forbid writers from having 
anyone shoot himself or herself or themselves in the foot to describe 
inadvertent behavior. If all the recently shot feet stood end-to-end, they 
would stretch the length of the John Muir Trail. 
</P>
<P>
Unique is a word that isn't. This virus has so infected the language that 
particular or unusual or other simple, less assertive terms for rarity have all 
but disappeared in favor of a one and only connotation -- usually false, often 
in an advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
Cliches are the most common strain of language virus. Gobbledygook is the 
mutation most often affecting bureaucrats and politicians who would rather be 
obscure than be right. The National Council of Teachers of English awarded 
Public Doublespeak citations for 1988 to the agricultural spokesperson who 
called pigs and cows "grain-consuming animal units," and to the safety expert 
who described an aircraft crash as "uncontrolled contact with the ground." 
</P>
<P>
At this point in time, our lingering wheeze from Watergate days, there is no 
vaccine for verbal virus. Susceptible word-consuming human units are advised to 
avoid talk shows and look out for 30-second spots.

LITTLE CHOCOLATE DOUGHNUTS TELL THE TALE OF THE U.S. TRADE CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH ROBINSON, Keith Robinson is a syndicated cartoonist in Manhattan Beach 
whose book, Making It: a Survival Guide for Today, has just been published by 
Harper &amp; Row.

<TEXT>
<P>
We hear a lot of talk that if the United States were allowed to compete on an 
equal footing with foreign manufacturers, our product quality and marketing 
skills would once again make us No. 1 in the world. Well, I offer for 
consideration the following true story (I've protected the names of the 
manufacturers involved, but any connoisseur of little chocolate doughnuts will 
recognize their identities). 
</P>
<P>
Brand X is recognized as the Cadillac of little chocolate doughnuts -- light, 
fresh, with a chocolatey coating that is thick. Sweet. Oh-so-yummy. Most 
people's first choice. 
</P>
<P>
But we don't always have a choice. The micro-mini-market near me (selling 
"booze 'n' munchies," according to its sign) carried only Brand Y -- heavy, dry 
little chocolate doughnuts with a dark, oil-slick coating that leaves you 
looking as if you've just been fingerprinted. 
</P>
<P>
Still, when you wake up at the crack of noon needing little chocolate doughnuts 
to get your day started, you take what you can get. 
</P>
<P>
(Anyone who asks why I don't just go to the supermarket once a week and buy the 
ValuePak of Brand X little chocolate doughnuts should stop reading. You've no 
understanding of the American consumer and will miss the point of the story.) 
</P>
<P>
One morning, overcome by the urge for little chocolate doughnuts, I walked into 
the booze 'n' munchies store for a dose of Brand Y's LCDs. 
</P>
<P>
With a grimace, I bit into one. WHAM! Light, fresh! Oh-so-yummy! I looked at 
the package: no "New and Improved!" No "Now with even MORE Chocolatey 
Goodness!" But yes -- they were good! Almost as good (dare I think it?) as 
Brand X! 
</P>
<P>
I could purchase Brand Y little chocolate doughnuts proudly, no longer afraid 
that others were looking upon me with scorn ("Mommy! He's buying Brand Y!" 
"Don't point, Junior. Some people aren't as fortunate as we are. . . ."). It 
was a wonderful day! 
</P>
<P>
A month later the booze 'n' munchies store was sold. The new owner was behind 
the counter one morning as I bought my pack of Brand Y little chocolate 
doughnuts. 
</P>
<P>
"Going to start getting Brand X," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Great, although these have gotten a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
He shrugged. "Well, now you'll have your choice." 
</P>
<P>
You'll have your choice! Boy, that's the American way. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, a few days later, there they were, side-by-side: Brand X and Brand 
Y. What a great moment it was, being able to buy Brand X little chocolate 
doughnuts, the BEST little chocolate doughnuts. Only. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Something strange hit me midway through my first pack of Brand X little 
chocolate doughnuts in months -- I missed Brand Y. Had I grown accustomed to 
Brand Y's lower quality? Was Brand X too rich for my blood? 
</P>
<P>
The next day I held a taste test, alternating a little chocolate doughnut from 
Brand X with one from Brand Y. After 12 little chocolate doughnuts, I arrived 
at the startling conclusion: Brand Y had surpassed Brand X in chocolatey 
yumminess. I switched back to Brand Y. And I was happy. For about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
One morning I stumbled into the B 'n' M store for breakfast. No Brand Y little 
chocolate doughnuts. They weren't just out -- the entire rack was gone. Little 
chocolate doughnuts, cupcakes, wholesome snack pies -- everything. 
</P>
<P>
"The Brand Y people refused to be in the same store with Brand X," explained 
the owner. "Said if I kept selling Brand X, they'd pull out." 
</P>
<P>
"But I like their little chocolate doughnuts better than Brand X's," I 
protested. 
</P>
<P>
He shrugged. "Love to sell both, but Brand X has the better name." 
</P>
<P>
So I bought Brand X. Don't get me wrong -- they were good. But they weren't 
Brand Y. 
</P>
<P>
Next morning, Brand X was sold out. 
</P>
<P>
"Distributor comes Thursdays," said the owner. This was Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
After a little-chocolate-doughnutless weekend, I went into the store Monday. 
There, where once the Brand Y rack had stood, was a rack of Brand Z products -- 
cupcakes, wholesome snack pies and . . . little chocolate doughnuts. I bought a 
pack. 
</P>
<P>
Eeyew! 
</P>
<P>
Brand Z little chocolate doughnuts are not as bad as the old Brand Y little 
chocolate doughnuts were, but Brand Z little chocolate doughnuts, as I'm sure 
you experts will agree, simply have no taste. They're only good for the 
desperate times when Brand X is sold out. 
</P>
<P>
Which is usually. The booze 'n' munchies store gets its shipment of Brand X 
little chocolate doughnuts every Thursday. By Friday, they're sold out. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell the guy every week to bring more," shrugs the owner. "Now, the Brand Z 
guys, they always make sure we're stocked." 
</P>
<P>
Using the booze 'n' munchies store as our representative sample of the American 
market, what have we learned? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brand X, the brand with the best reputation, ignores feedback and winds up 
selling a fraction what it could. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brand Y, the brand with the best product, refuses to compete in an open 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brand Z, the worst of the three, is left to score the biggest sales. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as I sit here munching yet another Brand Z little chocolate doughnut, I 
can't help but wonder. In the huge conglomerate headquarters of Brand Z's 
parent company, just what language do you suppose they're speaking?

WHERE WAS U.S. IN NICARAGUA'S HOUR OF NEED?; 
</P>
<P>
DENIAL OF HUMANITARIAN AID CLASHES WITH OPEN HEARTS TOWARD ARMENIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICKEY LELAND, Rep. Mickey Leland (D-Tex.) is chairman of the House Select 
Committee on Hunger. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sight of rescue teams from around the world ignoring politics and rushing 
help to victims of the earthquake in Soviet Armenia has been one of the bright 
spots of a holiday season dimmed by disaster. We in the United States can take 
pride in our contribution. 
</P>
<P>
The instinctive response to the plight of the Armenians sent forth a signal 
that the people of the world realize that we live in a global village. Leaders 
of the Soviet Union abandoned their policy of secrecy and isolation while 
long-time adversaries of the Soviet Union put aside past animosities. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson of Armenia is that politics is not an issue when human beings have 
suffered terrible loss. A notable example came from an Israeli rescue team, 
some of whom had emigrated from the Soviet Union with no thought of returning. 
Although the two nations have not had diplomatic relations for more than 20 
years, this did not hinder the mission in Spitak and Leninakan. The team stayed 
for more than two weeks, triumphing when a 15-year-old boy was pulled alive 
from the debris eight days after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, there are children much closer to us geographically than those 
in Armenia who are homeless and hungry and whose parents have lost their lives 
or livelihoods in a natural disaster. These children and their families have 
not received aid through the government of the United States. They are the 
victims of Hurricane Joan in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
While the disaster in Armenia was of much greater dimension, Hurricane Joan had 
a devastating effect on Nicaragua. It left 250,000 persons homeless. Almost 3 
million people lost crops or otherwise suffered economic loss. Hospitals and 
schools were damaged or destroyed. A team of United Nations economists has 
estimated the loss at $840 million. 
</P>
<P>
Despite appeals from members of Congress and private groups such as Oxfam and 
the American Friends Service Committee, the United States has refused 
assistance to Nicaragua. Jamaica and Costa Rica, hit by the same storm, 
received help from this country. There have been no explanations as to why 
Nicaragua was counted out. Politics is the only apparent cause. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, U.S. policy has been to provide disaster relief as a purely 
humanitarian gesture, independent of politics. This dates back to a successful 
program led by Herbert Hoover to restore Europe after World War I and has 
continued through the Marshall Plan until today. In 1988 such aid went to 
victims of floods in Bangladesh and the Sudan, monsoons in India and Nepal, 
Typhoon Ruby in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
These actions flow from the Foreign Assistance Act, which authorizes the 
President "to furnish assistance to any foreign country, international 
organization, or private voluntary organization, on such terms and conditions 
as he may determine, for international disaster relief and rehabilitation." The 
responsibility is clearly the President's. 
</P>
<P>
President Reagan, in a recent interview with David Brinkley, called Nicaraguan 
President Daniel Ortega a "shameless dictator" who "doesn't stand in the same 
box with (Soviet President Mikhail S.) Gorbachev." Has the politics of aid 
reached the point of distinguishing between avowed communists when giving or 
withholding humanitarian aid? Should we allow the behavior of the Sandinistas 
to keep us from responding to people stricken by disaster? 
</P>
<P>
While we are not in open conflict with either the Soviet Union or Nicaragua, 
the recent history of national enmity makes it imperative to maintain the 
principle of nonpolitical humanitarian aid to innocent civilians. To undermine 
this principle erodes the internationally accepted Geneva conventions that have 
enabled the Red Cross, the Red Crescent and other agencies to bring medicine 
and food to noncombatants in times of war. 
</P>
<P>
The only country in the world that could pose a serious, immediate threat to 
the United States is the Soviet Union. Yet, we have responded generously to 
innocent civilians in that country in their hour of need. Under Anastasio 
Somoza, whose regime was more brutal and repressive, the United States provided 
relief to Nicaraguan earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters have been told that the Nicaraguan government would not accept 
assistance if it were offered. The National Assembly did reject a portion of 
the Contra aid package intended for all children who had been injured by the 
civil strife. In mid-November Ortega clarified that the ban was limited to the 
Contra package. Shortly thereafter, the Nicaraguan charge d'affaires in 
Washington said publicly that U. S. aid would be accepted through international 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The new openness of the Soviet government, as it welcomes outside help and 
becomes more a part of the world community, is a sign to the incoming 
Administration to reverse a foreign policy that has too often put ideology 
above basic human needs, above values that transcend government or party. It is 
time to reaffirm the American tradition of generous response to need simply 
because the need exists. 
</P>
<P>
Providing humanitarian aid promotes the national interests of the United 
States. We must recognize, however, that such aid makes its greatest 
contribution to our credibility and our reputation in the world when it is 
delivered in a nonpolitical manner.

BY GOING FOR BROKE, U.S. FOULS FARM TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. SAMUELSON, Robert J. Samuelson writes about economic issues from 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You don't need a Ph.D in economics to understand the European Community's 
common agricultural policy. It sets artificially high farm prices that create 
vast food surpluses. In November, for example, the world price for corn 
averaged $97 a metric ton. Meanwhile, the policy promised European farmers a 
minimum price of $212, a 119% premium. Naturally, European farmers produce as 
much as they can. Any surpluses are then dumped onto the world market with huge 
subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
It's clear who's hurt. First come Europe's consumers and taxpayers. Their food 
costs are too high, and 60% to 80% of the European Community's budget goes to 
the policy. Next come more efficient farmers -- in the United States, 
Australia, Canada, Argentina and other nations -- who lose export sales to the 
Europeans. Considering all these victims, there ought to be strong pressure on 
the European Community to change the policy. Think again. An intense U.S. 
campaign against the policy has had almost no success. 
</P>
<P>
It's a telling failure of economic diplomacy. Increasingly, the United States 
can advance its economic interests abroad only with the help of other nations. 
We're no longer so powerful that we can control the outcome of global 
negotiations. But we're clumsy at creating the international coalitions 
necessary to prevail. The farm negotiations (under the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, or GATT) are a case in point. When the talks recently broke 
down in Montreal, the Americans -- not the Europeans -- were mainly blamed. 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake: The talks are critical for U.S. agriculture. They may 
represent the best chance for America to cut its own costly farm subsidies. 
American harvests are steadily rising; last summer's drought only interrupted a 
long-term trend. Without expanding exports, U.S. farmers face rising surpluses 
and falling prices. The pressures for continued subsidies would be enormous. 
Other food exporters confront the same dilemma. Finally, greater agricultural 
exports would help some developing countries escape the debt crisis. 
</P>
<P>
But somehow U.S. trade negotiators have turned a strong moral position into 
political weakness. It's not that other food exporters like the agricultural 
policy. They don't. Most of the European Community's minimum prices (like that 
of corn) are set well above market levels. In November, the minimum price for a 
metric ton of soybeans was $577, more than double the world price of $267. 
Consumers pay these high prices. The Community maintains them by buying any 
surpluses at the minimums. Cheaper imports are generally kept out with variable 
levies that raise import prices slightly above the minimums. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that farmers elsewhere lose exports to Europe and must compete 
with European food surpluses -- sold at subsidized prices -- in third 
countries. The policy's protection has kept high-cost farmers in business. 
Efficient farmers are spurred to increase output by overusing fertilizers and 
pesticides. Food production has soared. The European Community once imported 
wheat; it became an exporter in the early 1970s. Since 1980, output of oil 
seeds (such as soybeans) has more than quadrupled. 
</P>
<P>
By all logic, the Australians, Canadians and others ought to be loudly echoing 
U.S. demands that the Europeans alter the policy. But the United States has 
alienated its natural allies by insisting that all countries commit themselves 
-- in advance of detailed negotiations -- to the eventual elimination of most 
farm subsidies. For the Europeans, this would mean signing an immediate death 
warrant for the policy. That's political suicide. It was this humiliating 
demand that caused the breakdown at Montreal. Other governments regard the U.S. 
position as wildly unreasonable. 
</P>
<P>
It's also unnecessary. The issue is not (as the U.S. position implies) all or 
nothing. Suppose the policy's excessive prices are cut 60% to 80% over a 
decade. That would be an immense achievement. But the talks are now stalemated 
over a non-negotiable principle. The Europeans have scored a public-relations 
coup and don't have to say how they'd change the policy to reduce its adverse 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
The agricultural policy is not, of course, the only example of farm folly. In 
addition to direct subsidies, the United States maintains import quotas on 
sugar and dairy products. Japan and Korea restrict rice imports. Any trade 
agreement would have to attack all these distortions. The political obstacles 
are similar everywhere. Farmers have grown dependent on protection, and 
governments often depend on the votes of farmers. But opening up world 
agriculture is not a utopian dream. It has a big constituency -- food exporters 
and, less obviously, taxpayers and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is that the United States has yet to mobilize this constituency. 
Any hard negotiation is full of drama and deadlocks. The GATT talks are 
scheduled to continue until 1990. They could yet succeed. But for that to 
happen, the United States will have to pursue its goals more adeptly. That's 
the real lesson here. Being right is not enough if, in the process, everyone 
else is offended by American self-righteousness.

OUR FORCES ARE AT THE READY, BUT NOT FOR CUTBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By C. A. H. TROST, Adm. C.A.H. Trost is chief of naval operations. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As concerns about the American economy grow, the debate over defense spending 
continues at a feverish pace. An entire spectrum of ideas has been placed 
before the public, with critics or "defense experts" having their own agenda on 
how to cut defense in an effort to reduce the nation's budgetary deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The discussions of cuts that indiscriminately have an impact on defense 
capabilities and current military readiness are both disconcerting and 
frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
The last eight years have seen some unmistakable gains in our military 
readiness and capability. U.S. naval forces (in fact, all U.S. military forces) 
have never been stronger or more ready. America's position in the world has 
also never been so strong. Our friends, who have never feared our leadership 
and have only wanted to count on our strength, can do just that. And potential 
adversaries now have to recalculate their ambitions because of our strength. 
</P>
<P>
Still, we see a move by various people who seem hellbent on throwing those 
gains away. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago, our political leaders -- with the support of the American 
public -- committed themselves to an investment. The investment was a large 
one, but was necessary to recover from the neglect of the 1970s when the 
military suffered from low states of readiness. Some ships couldn't sail 
because of material problems and personnel shortages; aircraft readiness was 
low because of lack of spare parts and trained maintenance personnel; morale 
problems abounded. 
</P>
<P>
This tremendous investment provided the nation with an extremely capable fleet 
and a professional personnel force that has never been more dedicated, spirited 
or well-trained. Simply stated, never has the Navy been more ready to respond 
to a wide range of contingencies and threats. 
</P>
<P>
The question is, does the nation have the resolve to preserve its investment or 
is it willing to return to the dark days of just a few years ago? To allow the 
latter to happen and fail to protect the investment would be the biggest case 
of fraud, waste and abuse this country has ever seen. History has repeatedly 
shown us the consequences of complacency. 
</P>
<P>
The critics would like to make us believe that we can't afford a strong 
military. They argue that the defense buildup has caused the budget deficit. 
Today, however, defense spending is less than 6% of our gross national product. 
During the years of the so-called Reagan buildup, it was never more than 6.3% 
-- and it has declined steadily in the last four years. But 20 years ago, that 
figure was 9% -- and we had a balanced federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
If one looks at a graph of defense and non-defense spending since 1969 (the 
last year of a balanced budget), we see that the curve for defense is 
relatively flat but that the curve for non-defense spending keeps turning 
upward at an alarming rate. And the key point is that the curve almost exactly 
matches the slope of our federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
It is frustrating for those in senior military positions -- those who are 
directly responsible for providing for our nation's security and who had to 
deal firsthand with our diminished capability in the last decade -- to see the 
apparent complacency, the almost perverted idealism, the unscrupulous 
politicking and the inability to see reason and logic in the one element of our 
great democracy in which the national interest should be above parochial 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
It is frustrating to deal with those who argue that because we have built 
something that works, we can afford to neglect it for a while. It is 
frustrating to argue with those who can't stand success, who can't seem to be 
comfortable with strength and who would apparently prefer being lovable losers. 
</P>
<P>
Why are we turning our backs on defense? People listen to Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, probably the greatest PR man in this century, and they 
think, in the immortal words of Neville Chamberlain, that we will have "peace 
for our time." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, it's not true; or at least, not yet. 
</P>
<P>
It has long been a military axiom that you must not get tangled up trying to 
unravel your opponent's intentions. Instead, you must keep your eyes on 
capabilities. To that end, many intelligent people seem to overlook the fact 
that Soviet military capabilities continue to grow while their intentions are 
being slickly packaged to look like democracy in action. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly something is happening in the Soviet Union today. But what it is, 
what it means and how long it will last are still uncertainties. The Soviets 
have not dismantled a single military system that they were not bound to do 
under constraints of treaty. Except in Afghanistan, they have not withdrawn 
from a single maritime or military position. 
</P>
<P>
It's still a very dangerous world and the threat still threatens. We can watch 
and hope. But let's keep our heads on straight.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: KUDOS TO THOSE WHO WERE NICE TO US IN '88 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER S. GREENBERG, Greenberg is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that 1988 is behind us, it's a good time to acknowledge those who helped 
make our travel experiences bearable, even enjoyable, last year. Some awards -- 
not for anyone who has been naughty, but only for those who've been nice. 
</P>
<P>
Best First-Class Service: Singapore Airlines. Again this airline wins for 
class, as well as style. It even wins for food, some of which is cooked to 
order on board. If you like your eggs poached, they'll be poached. 
</P>
<P>
Best Business-Class Service: British Airways. The airline has come a long way 
from the old business class of coach seats and a few free drinks. Its new Club 
Class is well recommended. 
</P>
<P>
Honorable mention to Virgin Atlantic. The airline's "upper-class" service is a 
well-kept secret. It's excellent, and equals, if not surpasses, other airlines' 
first-class sections in terms of passenger space and other goodies, like a free 
one-way coach ticket for taking just one trip. 
</P>
<P>
Best Coach Service: Lufthansa. Efficient, courteous and even the meals are 
thoughtful, with things like fresh fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Best First-Class Seats: If you want to know the reason why Royal Jordanian 
Airlines has spent upwards of $10,000 per first-class airline seat, just sit 
down. These hydraulic electric marvels are truly the closest things to real 
beds an airline can provide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rivals to First Class 
</P>
<P>
Best Business-Class Seats: a tie, between Cathay Pacific Airlines and British 
Airways. Both airlines radically restructured their business class in 1988, and 
a major part of that included removing and redesigning business-class seats, 
head rests, leg rests and added leg room. And both airlines did almost too good 
a job in business class. Each is now laboring to make its first class even 
better, because in many cases the improved business class now rivals first 
class on some other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Best Coach Seats: No award. In this category, things have actually gotten 
worse, not better. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanest Planes: Japan Airlines. Its flight attendants come as close to 
providing perfect service as possible. Can you name another airline where the 
flight attendants rush into the lavatories after each passenger has left to 
clean them? 
</P>
<P>
Best Domestic Airline: American Airlines. It still has a deserved reputation 
for consistency of service and one of the best route structures in the United 
States. It is also an airline that is rapidly expanding to Europe through new 
U.S. gateways like Raleigh-Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Western Winner 
</P>
<P>
Best Regional Airline: Alaska Airlines. The airline, based in Seattle, offers 
great in-flight food, good on-time performance, clean airplanes and some of the 
nicest, most helpful flight attendants I've ever met. In case you haven't flown 
the airline, Alaska flies to 32 cities in the United States and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Best International Airline: a three-way tie among Singapore Airlines, Thai 
International and SAS. 
</P>
<P>
Best Domestic Airport: a three-way tie. If you define a great airport as (1) 
convenient, (2) efficient and (3) passenger-friendly, then kudos must go to the 
airports in Oakland, Kansas City and Tampa. They are distinctly uncrowded, well 
designed and pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
Best International Airport: Schiphol, in Amsterdam. It defines the word 
efficiency. And, if you like duty-free shopping, this is your place. Honorable 
mention: Changi Airport in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
The Humanitarian Travel Award: Doubletree Hotels. Again this year, the hotel 
chain will provide free short-term lodging for those in need during this 
holiday season. The chain's Room at the Inn program is offered to individuals 
and families visiting loved ones in out-of-town hospitals, and runs each year 
from Thanksgiving through New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Honorable mention to Clark Howard, a retired travel agency owner. Earlier this 
year, Eastern Airlines had a special promotion for its 60th birthday. The 
offer: People who flew the airline 60 times in 60 days would get 60 free 
tickets. Eastern never thought anyone would take them up on the offer. But 
Howard did -- and won, then gave the tickets to several charities in Georgia so 
that local needy children could take their first plane ride as well as enjoy a 
California vacation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vacation Tips 
</P>
<P>
The Safe Travel Award: Westin Maui. You can thank the hotel, or perhaps its 
attorneys, for this, but thanks are due to the hotel for providing truly useful 
information about the sun and surf. In a pamphlet distributed to its arriving 
guests, the hotel gives specific tanning advice: "Spend a short time in the sun 
during your first day or two and gradually build up during your stay." Some 
swimming advice: "Enter the ocean gradually and carefully. Breakers come in 
'sets' with spells of calm in between." Plus: "Never turn your back to the 
ocean." If this seems like basic common sense, it is. But remember, most 
visitors to Maui don't live near the water, nor do they enjoy year-round 
sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
The Thoughtful Hotel Award: a tie, between the Hyatt Key West Hotel and 
Stouffer Hotels and Resorts. Earlier this year, when the Key West International 
Airport needed a face lift, but there was no county budget for the project, the 
Hyatt Key West hotel staff donated their time and repainted the terminal. 
Stouffer wins for abandoning a long-standing rip-off in the hotel business. The 
chain correctly identified a major traveler complaint, and dropped surcharges 
on credit-card phone calls, collect calls and calls to toll-free 800 numbers. 
Three cheers to Stouffer; it's about time. Honorable mention to Hyatt Hotels, 
which has decided against using the more expensive alternative operator service 
(AOS) to supply its long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
The Thoughtful Airline Award: UTA French Airlines. In order to welcome 
Americans to France, folks who travel on a UTA Holidays trip will receive a 
"telecard" good for a free four-minute call to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Freedom of Travel Award: to Japan. An agreement was just reached between 
the United States and Japan exempting most Americans from needing a visa to 
visit the country. Now, if we could only afford the visit! 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
And Just for Fun 
</P>
<P>
There are also some unusual award winners: 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 Best Travel Lawsuit Award: to the case of the sunburned buns. A court 
in Madison, Wis., heard the story of the woman who stayed in the artificial sun 
a little too long. The woman sued a local tanning salon, claiming she suffered 
second-degree burns that ruined her vacation in Jamaica by making it impossible 
to bask on the beach. She won. 
</P>
<P>
And, finally, the 1988 Best Retort to a Lost Travel Lawsuit Award: to Robert 
Hazard, president and chief executive officer of Quality International. The 
company was sued by McDonald's after it announced its intention to use the name 
"McSleep" for a chain of budget hotels. After McDonald's won the suit, Hazard 
announced the new chain would be called "Jack in the Sack." Actually, the new 
hotels will be called Sleep Inns. 
</P>
<P>
Merry Christmas.

ONE ENCHANTED DAY WHEN PETER RABBIT STIRRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB O'SULLIVAN, O'Sullivan is a travel writer based in Canoga Park. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The names Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail have never figured very large in my 
adult vocabulary. Not that they weren't there. They were just too deep in 
memory for easy retrieval. 
</P>
<P>
Your average semi-macho guys, or even us everyday garden variety couch 
potatoes, just don't tend to hang onto those memories we formed before being 
checked out on two-wheel bikes. Unless we've had a refresher course. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I recently had a refresher course. 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, we were in the Lake District of Cumbria -- which is about hip 
high on the British Isles -- and having a pretty good time. There aren't a 
whole lot of places on this earth as pretty or as peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Lakes 
</P>
<P>
We were told there are 23 lakes. Someone else said there are 19, so I suspect 
the total number sort of depends on whether or not it rained recently. I do 
know that however many there are, they're in one of the most awe-inspiring 
settings. 
</P>
<P>
Mile after mile of rolling meadows, forests and mountains, their tops 
frequently lost in cloud. There are fields of wildflowers, waterfalls and about 
every green that nature's got. 
</P>
<P>
There are sheep -- armies of sheep, eating as fast as they can but never 
catching up with the growing landscape. And there's something else . . . a 
feeling that goes with the territory. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce and I were talking with Paul Carlin, a friend who'd come to the Lake 
District from London to manage the Borrowdale Gates Hotel near Keswick. He 
grinned as we raved about the countryside, as proud as if he'd created it 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visitors From All Over 
</P>
<P>
"It's truly unique, you know, and I know what you mean about the feeling," 
Carlin said. "People come to the Lake District from your Wisconsin and 
Minnesota, where lakes are common. 
</P>
<P>
"Even from Colorado and British Columbia, whose mountains and lakes dwarf what 
we have here. And they're just as enchanted as everyone else. And I think I 
know the reason. It's not the lakes, you know." 
</P>
<P>
"What is it?" Joyce asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," Carlin said, "I'm almost afraid to talk about it." He leaned forward 
and lowered his voice. "It may be something left over from the Druids or 
Merlin's time, but I think it's magic. I really believe there is a kind of 
enchantment here." 
</P>
<P>
We'd almost come to that conclusion on our own. You can't drive through the 
area without having that thought. We'd recently visited Dove Cottage, where 
William Wordsworth lived with his family. 
</P>
<P>
Though the cottage looks as if it's 300 years old, it's really kind of 
commonplace. The most unusual thing about it is that the children's rooms are 
wallpapered with newspapers. (The guidebook said Wordsworth thought it would 
make the rooms warmer in the winter.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Setting Is Unusual 
</P>
<P>
But it's not the cottage, it's the setting that makes it unusual. When you see 
the view from the room where Wordsworth did his writing, you begin to 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
You see Lake Grasmere cupped in rolling green hills, as still and reflecting as 
a mirror. The morning we were there, a few clouds were all but settling on its 
surface; you could feel a bit of the magic. 
</P>
<P>
There was no way a man of Wordsworth's talents could have lived in the area 
without becoming what he was -- a poet laureate, the greatest poet on nature 
that England has produced. 
</P>
<P>
"Wordsworth? Yes," Carlin said. " 'Lucy,' 'The Solitary Reaper' and 'Daffodils' 
are very nice. And you'll never convince me that James Hilton didn't spend some 
time here before he wrote about Shangri-La in 'Lost Horizon,' but I was 
thinking more in terms of Peter, Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail." 
</P>
<P>
"Who?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Peter Rabbit!" Joyce exclaimed. "That's right! Beatrix Potter lived here in 
the Lake Country, didn't she?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Almost Missed House 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I meant by enchantment," Carlin said. "Her house is just down the 
way. I'll jot down some directions for you." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't "just down the way" at all. It was a couple of lakes and a few dozen 
turns down a long road, but the trip wasn't a chore, because the country itself 
was satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
We missed the house the first time and had to backtrack. We'd have missed it 
again, except a small sign said, "Hill Top House," which my wife recognized 
from the stories. 
</P>
<P>
At first there didn't seem to be any true personality about the place. Slowly 
the lady herself, Beatrix Potter, began to take form as our guide walked us 
through the garden. 
</P>
<P>
"It's patterned after Mr. McGregor's garden," she said. "Does that ring a 
bell?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suddenly Interested 
</P>
<P>
It meant something to most of the visitors, including Joyce, whose interest in 
the garden was suddenly aroused. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's McGregor?" I asked. "Refresh my memory." 
</P>
<P>
No one answered. They were all listening as the guide led us into the house. 
She explained how Miss Potter had lived in an era that expected all proper 
young women to go from their father's house to their husband's. 
</P>
<P>
Beatrix, a very average-looking young lady who spent a good part of her 
growing-up years in the sparsely settled area, had been alone a lot. Having few 
callers and a great deal of time, she had taken to sketching and writing 
stories about the things she knew and loved, like the countryside and some of 
its inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
One of them was a very young rabbit, whom she named Peter. It wasn't much of a 
story. It dealt with Peter leaving his siblings -- Flopsy, Mopsy and 
Cottontail, who were "good little bunnies" -- and going out and losing the new 
coat his mother had made him. 
</P>
<P>
He lost it when he was almost caught by Mr. McGregor, whose garden Peter had 
been told never to visit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limited Edition 
</P>
<P>
In 1902, probably more on the strength of the sketches than the stories, a 
London publisher took a chance and brought out a limited edition of "The Tale 
of Peter Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
There were no limitations from then on. Beatrix Potter wrote and illustrated 
more than 25 children's books, which were published in dozens of languages, to 
the delight of millions of children. And then their children and their 
children's children. 
</P>
<P>
"Did Beatrix Potter have children of her own?" someone asked. 
</P>
<P>
"She eventually married a man named William Heelis," the guide answered, "but 
she was childless." 
</P>
<P>
A woman asked if Miss Potter had been able to enjoy any of her success, or 
whether fame had only come after her death. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a very canny lady who enjoyed huge success and made a great deal of 
money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Purchased Land 
</P>
<P>
The tour group grew silent. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact," said the guide, "she loved the district so, that to have some 
control over what might happen to it, she began slowly buying up more and more 
property in the area to keep it from being destroyed by what the world calls 
'progress.' 
</P>
<P>
"In addition to her writing, she spent her time working to protect all of this 
part of Cumbria, to keep it pure and unspoiled for all time. Her efforts are 
largely responsible for the fact that this whole district is now under the 
protection of the National Trust. God willing, and thanks to Beatrix Potter, it 
may be protected forever." 
</P>
<P>
The tour ended and we left the house, a few feet behind a young family. As we 
entered the garden again, a bird flew out of the hedge just in front of us. The 
daughter of the family, a girl of perhaps 4 or 5, heard the rustling noise and 
turned quickly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thought She Saw Him 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, papa," she said excitedly. The mother and father stopped and turned. The 
little girl spoke excitedly to her parents in a language neither Joyce nor I 
could understand. Her father answered her and then smiled at us. 
</P>
<P>
"She wants to know was that Peter Rabbit who just came out of the bushes. I 
told her I didn't know because I had not seen." 
</P>
<P>
The little girl thought for a few seconds and then, nodding her head firmly, 
spoke again. Her father translated. 
</P>
<P>
"She says she thinks it was Peter Rabbit, that she thinks she caught a glimpse 
of him." The little girl ran around looking under rose bushes and behind hedges 
for another glimpse as we approached the gate cottage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interesting Theory 
</P>
<P>
Almost as a conspirator, the father shared a final thought with his wife and 
with us. "It probably was not really Peter Rabbit, you know. That rabbit would 
be 85 years old now." He winked. "Probably one of his children or his 
grandchildren, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
Carlin stopped by our dinner table in the hotel dining room that night and 
asked if we'd made it to Hill Top House and what we thought of his theory. 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't tell us what the lady had done for the district." 
</P>
<P>
"Or," Joyce said, "that it was Peter Rabbit that really started it all." 
</P>
<P>
"And, I'll bet," Carlin said, "that they told you Beatrix Potter never had any 
children, too." 
</P>
<P>
"You mean she did?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I see it, she had millions of children . . . generations of millions 
of children," he said. "And didn't she leave them a lovely garden to play in?"

Letter From England 
</P>
<P>
From Mary Evans of Great Britain: "I would dearly love to visit California, and 
preferably not as a 'package tourist.' So I'm wondering whether any of your 
readers would like to exchange a holiday with me? I'm a divorced, Irish-born 
woman in my early 50s. Self-employed and had my own antique shop for some 
years. Would be delighted to take my exchange visitor out to London, antique 
shops, country houses and show her (or him) around. I live 45 miles from 
London." 
</P>
<P>
The idea is for the Californian, in turn, to host Mrs. Evans in the United 
States. Her address: 97 Newport Road, Woburn Sands, Milton Keynes, England MK17 
8UN. 
</P>

If Harlowe wants to see the real Soviet Union she should stay away from cities 
like Moscow and Leningrad. They represent their country as much as Tijuana and 
Juarez represent Mexico. Moscow and Leningrad have been set up to appeal to 
Western tourists. Mostly everything in these cities has been carefully 
orchestrated to create a positive image. I was born and raised in Moscow, so I 
am very much aware of how this system has been set up. If Harlowe wants her 
eyes opened she should see towns outside of the mainstream -- if she can get 
permission.

Obviously Harlowe had not stopped in other cities than Moscow and Leningrad, 
for instance Smolensk, Zagorsk, Kalinin and Yaroslavl in the Russian Republic. 
If you really want some fun, see what happens when you land in Lviv, Odessa, 
Ternopil or Kaniv in the Ukrainian Republic. As an exchange student who 
recently finished studies in the Soviet Union, I can tell you that if you 
believe in glasnost, then I have a bridge to sell you.

I want to comment on the letter from Beverly Harlowe, who wrote about her 
positive experience with customs in Moscow and Leningrad, "Different Customs" 
(Nov. 27). As a person who is working in the Soviet Union (I am stateside on 
vacation), I can tell you that what foreigners experience in Leningrad, Moscow, 
Kiev and other "show" cities is not a true picture. 
</P>
<P>
I work as a translator to an American delegation, so I get to travel into areas 
where no American has ever set foot. Some of these areas are strategically 
off-limits to foreigners. Thus, I get to see the Soviet Union as it really is. 
</P>
<P>
Most of your readers have no idea what the real Soviet Union is like. They 
spend two weeks in tourist cities and they become instant experts. Glasnost is 
something that has been developed to appease the Western world. In reality 
there has been very little change. In cities where Westerners, particularly 
Americans, are accommodated, a show of glasnost is put on because the Soviets 
want that image to be taken back to the United States and shared with 
non-travelers.

Toni Taylor's article, "Agents Take a Beating" (Dec. 11), was the nicest thing 
that could have been written about the lonely life of a travel agent and the 
sometimes abuse we get from the travel industry whose livelihood really depends 
on us. I entered the travel field 41 years ago, and lots of changes have taken 
place in that time. But never have I read an article that was so concise and 
informative about the travel agent. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you for printing it. Please thank Toni Taylor for writing it. Also, 
thanks for providing your readers with an informative travel section. Without 
it, the public and travel agent would not be as well informed as we are now.

INSIGHTFUL COMMENTARY; 
</P>
<P>
BLIND TWIN BROTHERS GIVE SIGHTLESS RADIO LISTENERS A DIFFERENT VIEW OF ROSE 
PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY BARBER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While millions watch as television personalities describe the visual wonders 
passing before them in Pasadena on Monday, a pair of blind radio commentators 
will offer their own view of the Tournament of Roses. 
</P>
<P>
John and Larry Gassman, who have never seen the parade, will broadcast live for 
the third time from high in the press box. 
</P>
<P>
The Whittier twins, who coincidentally will celebrate their 34th birthday 
Monday, will begin their coverage of the parade at 8 a.m. on KPCC, Pasadena 
City College's radio station, a program that will be carried all over the 
country via satellite. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sighted Listeners, Too 
</P>
<P>
Experienced broadcasters who have had their own 2-hour show on KPCC since 1980, 
the men do their parade commentary especially for a blind audience. 
</P>
<P>
After much preparation, including "feeling tours" of floats under construction, 
they describe the parade in terms that are understandable to other sightless 
people. They often refer to textures of float materials and to sizes and shapes 
they have felt. 
</P>
<P>
But Larry Shirk, program director of KPCC who also serves as the Gassmans' 
spotter during the parade, said plenty of sighted people listen as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had so many people say they get sick and tired of the patter on 
television, and they turn down the sound on their sets and turn on the radio," 
Shirk said. He called the twins "extremely intelligent, with marvelous senses 
of humor.' 
</P>
<P>
Shirk said about 30 other public radio stations usually pick up the broadcast 
via satellite. KPCC is at 89.3 on FM radio and is the parade's "informational" 
station, Shirk said, giving weather, parking and traffic information before and 
after the parade broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
As on the past two New Year's Days, the twins will climb 65 feet to the 
broadcasting booth before 6 a.m. Monday. While others look down on Orange Grove 
and Colorado Boulevards through early morning darkness and frost, they rub 
their freezing fingertips across pages of Braille notes. 
</P>
<P>
Citing their biggest problem, John Gassman said, "When our fingertips freeze, 
the Braille becomes fuzzy. That's like reading a printed page and the lights go 
out. We tried last year to wear gloves with the fingertips cut out, but they 
still froze. Now we're going to try a portable lamp with heat. Actually, it's 
fun to figure out what to do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transcribe Into Braille 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the parade, the men tape press releases that are read aloud 
and then transcribe the tapes into Braille. Then they tape their observations 
while they tour the floats, literally getting a feel of their sizes and 
textures. In combining all of the material, they said they are prepared for 
every possible delay or mishap and always have much more background information 
and details than they have ever needed. 
</P>
<P>
In acting as spotter, Shirk joins them in their broadcast booth to describe 
anything that might occur in the parade that is not in the official lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"He tells us to speed up or slow down," John said. "Anyone knows that when 
you're describing a float and a band goes by, there's something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
They said their style is to talk to each other during the broadcast, 
questioning and answering to "keep it conversational." 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be talking to people, not at them," John said. "Talking at people 
is an easy trap to fall into. We try to stay away from sounding like we're 
reading. 
</P>
<P>
"If we use humor, it's not conscious, but if there's something funny and its in 
good taste, well. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weekly Program 
</P>
<P>
They have had years of practice, anticipating each other's comments and keeping 
up a lively patter. 
</P>
<P>
Their weekly radio show, "Same Time, Same Station," is on KPCC every Sunday 
from 6 to 8 p.m., when they replay old radio programs from their collection of 
13,000 that include Jack Benny, Bob Hope, "Suspense" and "Fibber McGee and 
Molly." Sometimes they interview writers or directors of the shows. 
</P>
<P>
Their collection is what John called "medium-sized, but all high-quality" 
recordings of the old programs. It began as a hobby and is continually growing 
as the men buy and trade with other collectors all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
They are identical twins who live together in their own home in Whittier, where 
they grew up and attended public schools. They are graduates of Rio Hondo 
College, where their interest in radio began when they began serving as hosts 
of a "Top 40s" show on the college radio station in the early 1970s. They are 
not employed, but hope their interest in radio, which is now a hobby, will lead 
to jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Nature 
</P>
<P>
They said their parents, both of whom have died, "purposely taught us that we 
were just like anyone else, so being blind was just second nature." 
</P>
<P>
They were born more than two months premature, and within three minutes of each 
other, John weighing 1 pound, 8 ounces, and Larry 1 pound, 10 ounces. As with 
many premature babies born during the 1950s, they were permanently blinded by 
excessive amounts of oxygen pumped into their incubators to help keep them 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never been anything but blind, so we never thought about it," Larry 
said. "We just learned to adapt and make the best of it. We're not negative 
people anyway." 
</P>
<P>
They said they have had responses to their parade commentary from people all 
over the country, not all of them blind. 
</P>
<P>
"No negative feedback, as far as we know," John said.

2 AGENCIES STRIVE TO TAKE OVER PEST ABATEMENT IN L.B. 
</P>

LONG BEACH

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what is developing into a territorial skirmish over mosquitoes, two 
government agencies are swatting at each other over which of them would do a 
better job of combating the city's mosquito population. 
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Mosquito Abatement District, which oversees mosquito control in 
the central and northeastern sections of the city, wants authority over 
mosquitoes in the rest of Long Beach -- now the province of the city Department 
of Health and Human Services. District officials contend the health department 
is too busy fighting other public health threats, such as rats, to pay 
sufficient heed to mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
Local health officials have, for their part, taken umbrage at the suggestion 
that mosquitoes are running wild in their part of the city. They retort that 
the abatement district is attempting to justify its mosquito grab with 
error-strewn allegations that the city's equipment, pesticides and vigilance 
are inferior. 
</P>
<P>
The district has long wanted to bring Long Beach under one anti-mosquito 
umbrella -- its own. Formed in 1952, the regional district assumed 
responsibility for what was then unincorporated county land in the Long Beach 
area. When the city annexed the land, the district retained mosquito 
jurisdiction, leaving Long Beach divided as far as mosquitoes were concerned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Communities Served 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the city of Signal Hill, surrounded by Long Beach, is in the 
district, as are the cities to the north of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We do a very extensive and thorough job of mosquito control," Jack Hazelrigg, 
the district's assistant manager and entomologist, said. While the city "does a 
good job," Hazelrigg added, "we can do a better job." 
</P>
<P>
The district's sole purpose in life is to keep mosquitoes in check, Hazelrigg 
stressed. It does that in 32 cities in Los Angeles County, along with 
unincorporated parts of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Diana M. Bonta, recently appointed director of the Long Beach Department of 
Health and Human Services, says she has no vested interest in guarding the 
city's mosquito turf. Nonetheless, she says she was disheartened at some of the 
district's contentions and feels compelled to correct them. 
</P>
<P>
She also points out that it would cost residents slightly more if they switched 
to the district, and she argues that a local, rather than a regional agency, is 
more likely to be responsive to residents' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The arbiter of the matter, the City Council, has referred the district's 
annexation request to its Public Safety Committee, which is holding hearings on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Undecided on Changes 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I haven't found the city to be wanting," Councilman Ray Grabinski, 
the committee's chairman, said. Grabinski, whose West Long Beach district falls 
under the city's jurisdiction, hastened to add that he had not decided whether 
any changes were in order. 
</P>
<P>
The move to bring all of Long Beach into the district was bolstered last summer 
when West Long Beach residents were tormented by swarms of midges, gnat-like, 
flying insects that do not bite, but do bother people. "You didn't want to open 
your mouth to breathe," said Dan Cangro of the Wrigley Assn., a neighborhood 
group that complained to the council that the city's bug-control efforts were 
not all they might be. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been our contention that if we were under the mosquito (district) 
program, we wouldn't have these problems. . . . The city has been pretty good, 
but it's been on a case-by-case basis," he said, arguing that the health 
department has neither the time nor the staff to devote as much attention to 
mosquito control as does the district. 
</P>
<P>
Bonta, pointing out that midges are largely the responsibility of county flood 
control authorities, says residents are mistaken if they think the district 
will eliminate the midge nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
The district is funded with annual property tax assessments of a couple of 
dollars on every parcel within the district. It would therefore not cost the 
city anything to relinquish its mosquito duties to the district. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, also on the Public Safety Committee, 
argues that however small the fee, it will cost residents something. "I'm not 
particularly receptive to turning it over to the abatement district," said 
Braude, whose shoreline district is within the health department's territory. 
He, too, says he is satisfied with the department's mosquito performance, 
although he agrees that a case can be made for consolidating mosquito control 
efforts in the city. 
</P>
<P>
It costs the health department about $24,000 a year to run its mosquito 
program, a sum that would likely be spent on some other city expense were it 
not used on mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the Public Safety Committee last month, Bonta complained that 
much of the district's information about the city's program "is simply 
incorrect." For instance, she said that contrary to the district's assertions, 
the department routinely sprays mosquito breeding areas and also uses 
biological controls, such as mosquito fish, which consume mosquito larvae. 
</P>
<P>
Bonta further argues that since it is necessary for her department to monitor 
mosquito-borne diseases, the city should continue to wage some of Long Beach's 
mosquito battles. It might even make sense to have the city take over the third 
of Long Beach now treated by the district, she said, adding that the costs of 
that move are being researched.

RESPONSE TIME OF PASADENA POLICE SHORT OF 6-MINUTE GOAL 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A city audit has concluded that police failed to respond to emergency calls 
within the department goal of six minutes nearly half the time during a recent 
7-month monitoring period. 
</P>
<P>
A manpower shortage was cited as the reason in the audit by city administrators 
and outside consultants. 
</P>
<P>
The audit also concluded that the Police Department should eliminate two of its 
four helicopters and consider transferring some of the officers from a special 
neighborhood crime task force to other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
According to the audit, officers did not meet the departmental goal of 
responding within six minutes to crimes that are life-threatening or in 
progress 48% of the time between July, 1987, and February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The average delay was one second more than six minutes. Response times ranged 
from 3 minutes, 16 seconds to 16 minutes, 26 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
During the monitoring period, the department had about 56 officers on patrol 
and was about 10 below the staffing level approved by the city. 
</P>
<P>
"What I don't understand is why can't we fill those positions?" asked city 
Director Kathryn Nack. "We have the money, why don't we have the people?" 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief James M. Robenson said the department has had a difficult time 
finding officers. 
</P>
<P>
He said it is difficult to find qualified candidates since only about one in 75 
is accepted. Many potential applicants prefer to work on smaller suburban 
forces, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena has tried to solve the problem by recruiting on college campuses 
around the country and setting up a toll-free telephone number to provide 
employment information, Robenson said. 
</P>
<P>
But Robenson said the audit was wrong in assuming the shortage has affected the 
department's response time to emergency calls. 
</P>
<P>
He said those calls are given top priority and even if a dozen new officers 
were hired, it would not significantly lower response times. More patrol 
officers, he said, would have a greater impact on less serious calls, which are 
sometimes delayed while police respond to emergency calls. 
</P>
<P>
Robenson also said the audit was misleading because it did not count the 
response time of police helicopters, which he said can reach the scene of any 
crime in the city in less than a minute. 
</P>
<P>
He added that even if the audit were accurate, a delay of a few seconds was 
still well within an acceptable range. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure I'd like to have the quickest response of any place, but we're talking 
about just a few seconds," he said. "If the trend is between six and seven 
minutes, I feel we're delivering at least what we should." 
</P>
<P>
Police in Pomona, which is comparable to Pasadena in population, has an average 
response time of 7 minutes, 50 seconds. Pomona has 94 patrol officers. 
</P>
<P>
The audit, which will be presented to the Board of Directors Jan. 10, was part 
of a series of reports commissioned by the city to study the operation of all 
its major departments, such as water and power and public works. 
</P>
<P>
The audit largely praised the Police Department for its responsiveness to the 
community and innovative approach to law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pasadena Police Department can be classified as an organization on the 
move," the audit stated. "Based on our analysis, the project team found no 
major efficiency or effectiveness problems." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor William Thomson said he was pleased with the results of the audit, saying 
it confirmed his belief that "we have a first-rate department." 
</P>
<P>
But Director William Paparian said the audit's conclusions led him to believe 
the department has gotten away from the basics of law enforcement to pursue 
"sexier" and more high-profile projects. 
</P>
<P>
"We ought to be going to more substance than flash," he said. "We've gone off 
on these sexy approaches and I think it's time we get back to the basics." 
</P>
<P>
One example, Paparian said, was the Neighborhood Crime Task Force, a special 
police unit formed to fight neighborhood crime and drug dealing, particularly 
in northwest Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The audit praised the task force for its high number of arrests and 
convictions, but noted the number of felony and drug arrests have dropped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Implications for Task Force 
</P>
<P>
The audit team, which included city administrators and outside consultants, 
said the smaller number of arrests for serious crimes may be the first sign the 
3-year-old task force has outlived its usefulness. 
</P>
<P>
The audit recommended the department consider transferring some of the task 
force's 18 officers to other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But Robenson said cutting back the task force would be a "disservice" to the 
northwest community, which still has the highest crime rate in the city. 
</P>
<P>
While the number of felony and drug arrests did drop by about 20% during an 
18-month period ending in 1987, the number of cases filed for prosecution 
remained the same, the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
Robenson said the task force allows the department to focus on combatting crime 
in the neighborhoods by freeing up officers for foot patrols throughout the 
city and undercover drug enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helicopter Unit 
</P>
<P>
The audit also raised concerns about the efficiency of the department's 
helicopter unit, which auditors said has more helicopters than it needs. 
</P>
<P>
The unit now has four helicopters, one of which is primarily used to ferry city 
officials and demonstrate the capabilities of helicopters to police officers. 
Other cities of comparable size have two helicopters to accomplish the same 
work, according to the audit. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why we need to have our own air force with a budget of $1.1 
million," Paparian said. "I'd like to see us spend that money on 
bread-and-butter stuff like more neighborhood patrols." 
</P>
<P>
The audit recommended selling two of the helicopters for an annual savings of 
as much as $640,000. 
</P>
<P>
But Robenson said to achieve those savings the department would have to 
eliminate daytime flights and cut back flight time from 3,750 hours a year to 
1,170. 
</P>
<P>
He said the department is spending about the same as other departments that 
have just two helicopters. For example, he said, Riverside police spent $1.3 
million and Newport police spent $900,000 last year to operate two helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
Robenson said having four helicopters is critical to the department's patrol 
strategy because they can reach the scene of a crime faster than a patrol car 
and can cover much more territory.

SANTA FE SPRINGS FIRMS CREATE AID NETWORK UNDER EMERGENCY PLAN 
</P>

SANTA FE SPRINGS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the dust from the Whittier Narrows earthquake on Oct. 1, 1987, finally 
settled, city officials began hearing from concerned business owners. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake knocked out telephone service, preventing the city's 3,500 
businesses from reporting emergencies such as fires and medical problems. The 
nearly 80,000 workers who commute to Santa Fe Springs daily clogged streets for 
hours. At one point it took nearly 2 hours for a city fire truck to travel 
about 3 miles from the fire station to City Hall, said Fire Chief Robert 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"Communications were terrible," Wilson said. "We were overwhelmed. We really 
had no idea what was going on in the city." 
</P>
<P>
The safety and satisfaction of the business community is especially important 
in Santa Fe Springs, where 85% of the land is zoned for commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
"In the daytime, we could have major problems just dealing with the numbers of 
people" who work here, said Assistant City Manager Fred Latham. "And if this 
were to occur at night, we could have unoccupied buildings with substantial 
damage and not be aware of it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Partnership Formed 
</P>
<P>
As a result of these concerns, the public and private sectors in Santa Fe 
Springs have formed a partnership to design an emergency-preparedness plan that 
would reduce the burden on city government in the three days after a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Fe Springs Chamber of Commerce suggested that businesses establish 
their own emergency communications network. City officials agreed, and in the 
past year the chamber's suggestion has evolved into an elaborate plan. Though 
supervised by the city, businesses will turn to one another instead of the city 
when disaster strikes. 
</P>
<P>
With just 15,000 residents concentrated in a 2-square-mile area, the best 
option for Santa Fe Springs is to rely on businesses in the other seven square 
miles of town to provide their own emergency support, said Tony Ferrara, a 
supervisor at the California Specialized Training Institute. The institute is a 
division of the state Office of Emergency Services which is helping a committee 
of city and chamber officials prepare the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The city told the businesses, 'We don't have the traditional support systems. 
So you are it,' " Ferrara said. "This was a tremendous buy-in on the part of 
industry . . . and the city was willing to depart from the norm as far as their 
association with the private sector. What they are doing is making use of what 
they have, and what they have is industry." 
</P>
<P>
If an earthquake were to happen once the city's plan is in place, this is how 
businesses would respond: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Command Posts 
</P>
<P>
They would immediately report to one of four command posts, where an area 
coordinator would report any emergencies to city officials by radio. Workers on 
foot or riding bicycles would check neighboring businesses for injured 
employees or other problems. 
</P>
<P>
Once damages are assessed, workers would turn to a handbook to see where 
emergency supplies are available. Under the cooperative plan, a food warehouse 
might agree to donate food and another firm might provide blankets or plywood 
for boarding up broken windows. 
</P>
<P>
"We are asking businesses to go beyond their own walls and hold hands," Latham 
said. "It's really exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Once post-disaster emergencies have been taken care of, the plan calls for 
businesses to resume operations quickly. For example, a business using propane 
might not be able to reach a supplier in Los Angeles, so the plan would include 
a list of propane suppliers in the immediate area. 
</P>
<P>
"An important element is getting the businesses running again," Wilson said. 
"They're producing resources that can be used for the recovery effort." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disaster Assistance 
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for familiarizing business owners with government disaster 
assistance loans and grants. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Landis, president of the Santa Fe Springs Chamber of Commerce, said the 
plan has met with an enthusiastic reception from the business community. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of resources in this city, and most businesses are willing to 
share them," Landis said. "We're going to wind up with a business community 
that is really well prepared. . . . We feel we are on the cutting edge of 
emergency preparedness." 
</P>
<P>
It will be about three years before the system is completely in place, Latham 
said. Next month, the chamber plans to mail questionnaires to all Santa Fe 
Springs businesses, requesting their participation and outlining information 
about operating hours, existing emergency plans and other relevant facts, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1989, organizers plan to have the handbook distributed and 
command posts set up. In 1990, they plan to complete training in disaster loan 
procedures, first aid and other emergency measures. Santa Fe Springs will 
assign one Fire Department employee to supervise the effort, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, impressed by the efforts of the business community, has asked 
city staff to develop a similar emergency response system for residential 
areas, Latham said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrara hopes that Santa Fe Springs' business network can become a model for 
other cities and counties with large industrial bases. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept is that over a period of time, there will be a network of 
communication and support," Latham said, "so when an emergency does occur, the 
relationships will automatically be in place."

REVIEWING THE 'CITY HALL CIRCUS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bravo to The Times for printing the facts objectively about the mess in Long 
Beach resulting from unrestrained and unplanned development! 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Kell is typically being demagogic when he says there is "plenty of blame 
to go around" for the mushrooming apartment houses where single-family 
dwellings stood a few months ago. He and three other members of the City 
Council alone approved this sellout. What Kell really means is there is plenty 
of blame to try to spread around, which he is, of course, trying to do. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even Kell is exceeded in artful dodging by Councilwoman Jan Hall, who 
managed to lead both the city of Long Beach and the RTD into disaster 
simultaneously and then duck responsibility for both. 
</P>
<P>
Not mentioned in your coverage was the incredible ineptitude displayed by Kell, 
Hall and company, in the matter of the airport and the Pandora's box of noise 
and pollution that has opened up. While other cities have been going in the 
direction of placing airports away from city centers and population, our 
council, of course, is going in precisely the opposite direction and trying to 
expand one in a prime residential section of our city! 
</P>
<P>
One who has followed the City Hall circus would, of course, expect a "solution" 
from Kell and Hall for the parking problem they have created; they want to 
harass a tiny, politically unprotected minority of small boat owners who cause 
probably less than one-tenth of 1% of the problem ("Long Beach Thinks Again 
About Paving of Greenbelt," Times, Dec. 4). Thus they can continue to flail 
around while giving the superficial impression of doing something. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, to call the Long Beach Planning Department ineffectual is to be unduly 
charitable. They have proven themselves to be the Keystone Kops of urban 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
One fears the inmates are running the asylum. Please keep your spotlight 
focused; it may perchance do some good.

SIGHTLESS TWINS GIVE LISTENERS A DIFFERENT VIEW OF ROSE PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY BARBER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While millions watch as television personalities describe the visual wonders 
passing before them in Pasadena on Monday, a pair of blind radio commentators 
will offer their own view of the Tournament of Roses. 
</P>
<P>
John and Larry Gassman, who have never seen the parade, will broadcast live for 
the third time from high in the press box. 
</P>
<P>
The Whittier twins, who coincidentally will celebrate their 34th birthday 
Monday, will begin their coverage of the parade at 8 a.m. on KPCC, Pasadena 
City College's radio station, a program that will be carried all over the 
country via satellite. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sighted Listeners, Too 
</P>
<P>
Experienced broadcasters who have had their own 2-hour show on KPCC since 1980, 
the men do their parade commentary especially for a blind audience. 
</P>
<P>
After much preparation, including "feeling tours" of floats under construction, 
they describe the parade in terms that are understandable to other sightless 
people. They often refer to textures of float materials and to sizes and shapes 
they have felt. 
</P>
<P>
But Larry Shirk, program director of KPCC who also serves as the Gassmans' 
spotter during the parade, said plenty of sighted people listen as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had so many people say they get sick and tired of the patter on 
television, and they turn down the sound on their sets and turn on the radio," 
Shirk said. He called the twins "extremely intelligent, with marvelous senses 
of humor.' 
</P>
<P>
Shirk said about 30 other public radio stations usually pick up the broadcast 
via satellite. KPCC is at 89.3 on FM radio and is the parade's "informational" 
station, Shirk said, giving weather, parking and traffic information before and 
after the parade broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
As on the past two New Year's Days, the twins will climb 65 feet to the 
broadcasting booth before 6 a.m. Monday. While others look down on Orange Grove 
and Colorado Boulevards through early morning darkness and frost, they rub 
their freezing fingertips across pages of Braille notes. 
</P>
<P>
Citing their biggest problem, John Gassman said, "When our fingertips freeze, 
the Braille becomes fuzzy. That's like reading a printed page and the lights go 
out. We tried last year to wear gloves with the fingertips cut out, but they 
still froze. Now we're going to try a portable lamp with heat. Actually, it's 
fun to figure out what to do." 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the parade, the men tape press releases that are read aloud 
and then transcribe the tapes into Braille. Then they tape their observations 
while they tour the floats, literally getting a feel of their sizes and 
textures. In combining all of the material, they said they are prepared for 
every possible delay or mishap and always have much more background information 
and details than they have ever needed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acting as Spotter 
</P>
<P>
In acting as spotter, Shirk joins them in their broadcast booth to describe 
anything that might occur in the parade that is not in the official lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"He tells us to speed up or slow down," John said. "Anyone knows that when 
you're describing a float and a band goes by, there's something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
They said their style is to talk to each other during the broadcast, 
questioning and answering to "keep it conversational." 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be talking to people, not at them," John said. "Talking at people 
is an easy trap to fall into. We try to stay away from sounding like we're 
reading. 
</P>
<P>
"If we use humor, it's not conscious, but if there's something funny and its in 
good taste, well. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
They have had years of practice, anticipating each other's comments and keeping 
up a lively patter. 
</P>
<P>
Their weekly radio show, "Same Time, Same Station," is on KPCC every Sunday 
from 6 to 8 p.m., when they replay old radio programs from their collection of 
13,000 that include Jack Benny, Bob Hope, "Suspense" and "Fibber McGee and 
Molly." Sometimes they interview writers or directors of the shows. 
</P>
<P>
Their collection is what John called "medium-sized, but all high-quality" 
recordings of the old programs. It began as a hobby and is continually growing 
as the men buy and trade with other collectors all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
They are identical twins who live together in their own home in Whittier, where 
they grew up and attended public schools. They are graduates of Rio Hondo 
College, where their interest in radio began when they began serving as hosts 
of a "Top 40s" show on the college radio station in the early 1970s. They are 
not employed, but hope their interest in radio, which is now a hobby, will lead 
to jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Nature 
</P>
<P>
They said their parents, both of whom have died, "purposely taught us that we 
were just like anyone else, so being blind was just second nature." 
</P>
<P>
They were born more than two months premature, and within three minutes of each 
other, John weighing 1 pound, 8 ounces, and Larry 1 pound, 10 ounces. As with 
many premature babies born during the 1950s, they were permanently blinded by 
excessive amounts of oxygen pumped into their incubators to help keep them 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never been anything but blind, so we never thought about it," Larry 
said. "We just learned to adapt and make the best of it. We're not negative 
people anyway." 
</P>
<P>
They said they have had responses to their parade commentary from people all 
over the country, not all of them blind. 
</P>
<P>
"No negative feedback, as far as we know," John said.

LONG BEACH URGED TO HELP HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe for the New Year . . . the Long Beach city administration might . . . 
officially help the homeless in the Long Beach area. 
</P>
<P>
As an article in the Long Beach section showed (Times, Dec. 22), local 
restaurants, such as Vincent Williams' Golden Bird chicken outlets, donate food 
to the Long Beach Family Shelter for the Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Other restaurants such as Justina's in downtown Long Beach, Domino's Pizza and 
Twin Wheels Steak House have jumped on the bandwagon in giving food to the Long 
Beach Family Shelter for the Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
So when will the Long Beach City Council . . . jump on the bandwagon and take 
official action to help the homeless as recommended by the city's task force in 
1987? Will they do something in early 1989?

SUPER QUIZ DROPS 'CRUSOE' AFTER RACISM COMPLAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Robinson Crusoe" has been thrown overboard by the planners of the Los Angeles 
Unified School District's Sixth Annual Academic Pentathlon after a teacher 
complained about racial stereotyping in the literary classic. 
</P>
<P>
In October the district notified coaches preparing middle-school students for 
the districtwide academic competition that the Super Quiz would deal with 
Daniel Defoe's 18th-Century novel about shipwreck and survival. A few weeks 
later, the coaches were sent a memo saying the book had been withdrawn and 
replaced by Jules Verne's classic "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea." No reason was 
given for the change. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lorna Round, the district's associate superintendent of 
instruction, the Defoe book was dropped from the pentathlon after a coach in a 
predominantly black school objected to "the blatantly racist attitude pervasive 
throughout the book." Round declined to identify the coach, who is on winter 
break, without first obtaining his permission. 
</P>
<P>
Round said the coach had objected to passages such as the following description 
of Friday, the black man who ends Crusoe's decades of isolation: "He was a 
comely handsome fellow perfectly well made. . . . His hair was long and black, 
not curled like wool. . . . The color of his skin was not quite black . . . and 
yet not of an ugly yellow, nauseous tawny as the Brazilians . . . his nose 
small, not flat like the Negroes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Pulled From Shelves 
</P>
<P>
Round said the staff agreed with the coach's contention that "a book which 
reinforces negative racial stereotypes should not be the centerpiece of a 
districtwide competition." Round emphasized that the book had not been pulled 
from library shelves nor censored in any other way, only dropped from the list 
of material to be used in the competition. The pentathlon will be held Feb. 25 
at Fairfax High School. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not saying 'Don't read it,' " Round said. However, she said she and 
other staff members felt that, given the uncomplimentary characterization of 
blacks and other minorities in the book, it needed to be taught carefully. A 
specific concern, she said, was that the book's treatment of minorities might 
negatively affect the self-esteem of some minority students. 
</P>
<P>
Given the deadline imposed by the competition, she said, "we didn't feel we had 
time to talk to all the teachers (about ways the book might be constructively 
taught)." Round said the district hoped to develop a lesson plan for the book 
that would address the troublesome issues it raises. 
</P>
<P>
A few coaches called the district to protest the change in books, Round said. 
Most were distressed because they had already begun working with their students 
on "Robinson Crusoe." 
</P>
<P>
Both books are recommended for study by middle-school students by the state 
Department of Education. Janet R. Cole, a state education official, lauded the 
district for its handling of the matter. "I think it's wonderful that they are 
sensitive to the community. Both are excellent books. It doesn't matter which 
one they use."

SHOP OWNERS ARE PIONEERS IN REVIVING OLD WEST STYLE; 
</P>
<P>
MONTEREY FURNITURE RIDES BACK OUT OF SUNSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That low-slung, wooden couch with cushions covered in Mexican serapes is not 
cheesy: It's Monterey, Jack. 
</P>
<P>
What? You don't remember the style of furniture that filled working-class Los 
Angeles ranch houses in the 1930s and '40s, spread East with the lore of 
Westerns, then met an inglorious end in the rumpus room? 
</P>
<P>
Don't blame Don Shorts and Dolores Fisher. The proprietors of a Ventura 
antiques shop, they take credit for rekindling interest in Monterey furniture, 
which is decorated with wrought-iron hinges, hand-painted donkeys, flowers and 
sombrero-bedecked figures. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to be considered the pioneers in bringing this thing back to light," 
explained Shorts, 54, who co-owns the Old California Store on East Thompson 
Boulevard with Fisher, 55. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cowboy Style 
</P>
<P>
Others may have received more publicity for selling the factory-made furniture 
that Ojai collector Bob Smith describes as "a motion-picture version of what 
cowboys might have had in the way of furniture -- if they had furniture." 
</P>
<P>
But none of the handful of Monterey dealers has done more to research and 
promote a style whose history was little known 6 months ago, the couple's 
colleagues agree. 
</P>
<P>
"I would certainly give the most credit for the resurrection to Don and Dee," 
said Jack Moore, a Pasadena antiques dealer who for 7 years has traded in the 
furniture that combines early California, Mexican and Western influences. 
</P>
<P>
Shorts and Fisher have turned their 1926 home, which doubles as living quarters 
and a showroom, into a Monterey monument, with a rotating selection of dining 
room sets, bedroom sets, living room groupings, Mexican kitsch and at least 
three photographs of Will Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
They also publish a newsletter on the furniture, serve as hosts at "openings" 
in the homes of clients, and organize outings to such shrines of Monterey 
furniture as Rogers' 1921 ranch house in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
The couple even organized a museum exhibition last summer of the ersatz cowboy 
furniture. "Monterey: An Exhibition of California Rancho Furniture, Pottery and 
Art" filled one story and part of a second at the Santa Monica Heritage Museum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Introduction 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition enhanced the furniture's status as a collectible by popularizing 
it, antiques dealers say. It also introduced the style to Kenneth Trapp, a 
curator of decorative arts at the Oakland Museum. Now he plans to include it in 
an upcoming exhibition of California Craftsman furniture. 
</P>
<P>
"It struck me as wonderfully ludicrous," Trapp said. 
</P>
<P>
And so it is. Consider the chaise lounge done up frontier-style, with a canvas 
canopy to complete the covered-wagon look. Or the grand piano fashioned out of 
wood so rough-hewn that it looks as if it had been dragged through a mountain 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 2 years, the Westward-ho look has become Westward-haute. Magazines 
such as Metropolitan Home and Better Homes and Gardens have praised Monterey 
furniture, tony Los Angeles shops have taken to selling it, and one shop even 
peddles modern-day reproductions of it. 
</P>
<P>
The limelight also has fallen on the designer of the Monterey line, George 
Mason, an 81-year-old retiree now living in San Luis Obispo. Instead of making 
couches and chairs, these days Mason occupies himself with painting, and lately 
his favorite subject has been his own rediscovered furniture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paintings Exhibited 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in December, Shorts and Fisher mounted an exhibition of the folksy 
paintings at their store. Mason's painted renditions of Monterey furniture sold 
briskly for as much as $185 apiece, while about 50 collectors competed for his 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I came down from Pismo Beach just to shake his hand," gushed Patricia Slater, 
53, a designer of what she described as "cowboy punk" furniture. 
</P>
<P>
It almost seemed like the good old days to Mason, whose father ran the Los 
Angeles factory where his designs were made. In 1929, executives of Barker 
Brothers Furniture asked the pair to design and manufacture a line that would 
bear the Monterey name and would suit the ranch houses springing up all over 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The Masons were told to take their cue from a settee that appeared in the 
background of a Warner Brothers movie, "Old Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
Made from Oregon alder, stained in six colors and shaped into about 120 pieces, 
each quirkier than the last one, the furniture was a hit, as were a host of 
copycat lines: La Fiesta, Coronado, Ranch-O. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey-style furniture spread to homes in Texas, New York, Chicago and 
Florida. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Changing Times 
</P>
<P>
In 1943, Mason was drafted; his father died, and Monterey came to a grinding 
halt. After the war, tastes changed. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone threw it out and got chrome and glass," said Betty Gold, who stocked 
her much-publicized Melrose Avenue furniture shop, Territory, with Monterey 
purchased from Shorts and Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
The distinctive furniture became, as one collector says, "grist for garage 
sales." 
</P>
<P>
Enter Shorts, who 10 years ago quit his job as a high school history teacher in 
Santa Barbara to devote himself full-time to his hobby of collecting old 
paintings and furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
The homemade crafts and pottery that sold at roadside stands throughout 
Southern California in the 1930s had begun to attract his attention. Typically 
decorated with sombrero-topped men either asleep beneath cactuses or leading 
stubborn mules, they reminded him of his South Gate childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a '30s Southern California child and have never outgrown it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shorts discovered Monterey furniture and liked how well it matched the 
knickknacks he was acquiring. 
</P>
<P>
He bought the furniture first for himself, because he did not think it would 
sell. In fact, it was not until 2 years ago that the shop began to deal 
exclusively in Monterey-style furniture and its trappings. Since then, sales 
have tripled, he said, and he delves into a network of thrift shops and 
secondhand stores to replenish his stock. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, Shorts was not sure until recently what he was selling. He 
had noticed that the pieces were all branded with the same label -- "Monterey" 
-- but unraveling their origins proved difficult. 
</P>
<P>
One person told him that the furniture came from Monterrey, Mexico. No, another 
said, Monterey, Calif. But a Monterey, Calif., antiques dealer put that notion 
to rest. "Oh, that's what we call Carmel furniture," she told him. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until a friend found an old Barker Brothers catalogue that Shorts 
had a tangible lead. Lacking details, however, Shorts wrongly concluded that 
the company had manufactured the furniture, not merely sold it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Error Noted 
</P>
<P>
Mason, the furniture's real manufacturer, noted the error when he read an 
article about the Santa Monica exhibition. "It made me so angry," remembers 
Mason, who complained to the museum's director, Tobi Smith. She was only too 
happy to hear from him. 
</P>
<P>
Smith enlisted both Mason and Shorts to write chapters in an upcoming catalogue 
of the exhibition, which will include an essay by Smith's husband, Bob, the 
Ojai collector, who also teaches furniture design at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Titled "My Mexicana Nirvana," Bob Smith's piece hails the furniture as "a 
unique manifestation of Western urban culture." 
</P>
<P>
"Woven with mythology, fantasy, eclecticism and pretension, Monterey furniture 
is synonymous with Southern Californians' collective search for a meaningful 
identity -- a population with no heritage and little in common," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Smith believes that modern furniture buyers are attracted to Monterey 
because it tickles the modern fancy. 
</P>
<P>
"As an unabashedly eclectic and nostalgic movement, Postmodernism says it's all 
right to borrow style or fake material if you are honest about it," he said. 
And "Monterey Furniture is honestly fake." 
</P>
<P>
Even honestly fake furniture comes with a price. A dining room set sells for 
$3,500 at the California shop, which is still less expensive than a fine chair 
from the Arts and Crafts Movement but is much more than the $79 Mason remembers 
the same pieces selling for originally. 
</P>
<P>
But for collectors, such as Alan Erenberg, 39, the cost is worth it. He says 
the furniture perfectly fits the hacienda-inspired architecture so prevalent in 
Southern California. A vice president of Serta, the mattress company, he and 
his former wife, Lori, replaced their collection of '50s furnishings with 
Monterey when they bought a 1920s California ranch house. When they recently 
divorced, he said he "got custody" of the furniture, which now decorates his 
Spanish Revival apartment in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
That does not mean, however, that everybody loves Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Gloria List's clients at Nonesuch Gallery in Santa Monica "find it 
garish and klutzy," she said. And even converts can tire of Monterey's quirky 
style. Two of Shorts' best customers, he sadly reports, recently tossed out 
their Monterey collection in favor of crisp, contemporary furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
But Mason is glad that at least some see the world through his eyes. After 
returning from military service, he longed for the Monterey days. First he 
represented another furniture company; then he ran a store that sold Colonial 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
"I was an unhappy guy," he said.

STATE DROPS THREAT TO FINE WHITTIER ON WASTE MISHAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WHITTIER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state has dropped its threat to fine the city up to $30,000 in connection 
with a June mishap at a household toxic-waste roundup after city officials 
warned that they would refuse to hold more roundups. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Health Services cited Whittier for failing to report to 
the state that a contractor hired to manage the roundup created a small toxic 
cloud by mixing several types of acids together. By law, the state should have 
been notified within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Marxen, a spokesman for the Department of Health Services, said the state 
decided against the fine because it might scare off other cities conducting 
toxic-waste roundups. In such roundups residents dispose of household chemicals 
such as paint thinners and insecticides. About 400 households participated in 
Whittier's roundup. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not after the money," Marxen said. "What we're after is having them 
comply with the law and understand that they have violated the law. . . . The 
public airing of their fault was felt to be enough of a punishment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City's Position 
</P>
<P>
Michael Woods, an attorney who handled the case for Whittier, said the city was 
"not simply going to roll over" and take the fine. The city's position has been 
that any fine as a result of the accident should be paid by the contractor, 
Omega Recovery Services, which was paid $60,000 for the job, Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials also told the state that if Whittier were fined, the city would 
refuse to conduct any more toxic roundups, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the city was going to end up getting slapped with a fine for its 
responsible effort (to hold the roundup), then why take that risk?" Woods 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
In an out-of-court settlement of the issue, city officials agreed to: 
</P>
<P>
Make presentations to other cities in the Los Angeles area about the correct 
way to run a household toxic-waste roundup; 
</P>
<P>
Provide extra training over the next eight months to city employees involved in 
handling hazardous wastes. 
</P>
<P>
Send the state within 60 days a detailed plan for any future hazardous-waste 
roundups. 
</P>
<P>
Request state approval at least 60 days before any future roundup. The state 
normally requires only 30-days' notice from agencies who want to organize such 
events. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Going to Be Watching' 
</P>
<P>
"This is just as serious as when we were talking about the fine," Marxen, the 
health services spokesman, said of the agreement. "We're going to be watching 
(Whittier officials) pretty closely in the future because of their track 
record." 
</P>
<P>
During the roundup, Dennis O'Meara of Omega Recovery Services mixed several 
types of potent nitric acid in a 55-gallon drum. O'Meara, who was not wearing 
the proper protective clothing, was treated at a hospital after his face and 
arms were burned. 
</P>
<P>
After the citation was reported in news accounts, the city fired Tom Bayles, 
the assistant public services director responsible for hazardous waste 
disposal.

<P>
The USO has received a city permit to move its administrative offices and 
social club into the restored Masonic Temple on Pine Avenue in downtown Long 
Beach, close to the 16,000 military personnel who live in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the United Service Organizations of Los Angeles say the Pine 
Avenue club will open this spring. It will provide a lounge and game room for 
servicemen. In addition, it will offer a variety of services to military 
families, such as housing and child-care referrals. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach, with its sizable military population, is now a much more suitable 
site for the club than Hollywood, USO officials said.

President Francois Mitterrand stressed France's role in a unified Europe by 
delivering a New Year's Eve speech from Strasbourg, headquarters of the 
European Parliament. It was the first time a French head of state had made the 
traditional address to the nation from outside Paris. Mitterrand urged France's 
11 European Community partners to make 1989 a year of growth, saying: "Only a 
Europe united in technological, economic and monetary terms can rival Japan and 
the United States. Only a politically united Europe can hold up its head before 
the powers that dominate the world."

Twenty-seven people in Plymouth, Mass., were arrested on trespassing charges as 
125 activists demonstrated against the restart of the Pilgrim nuclear power 
plant, shut down since April, 1986, when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
branded it "one of the worst-run" nuclear plants in the country. Last week the 
plant started low-power testing, and it should be at full power in four months. 
The state has vowed to do everything possible to keep the plant from operating. 
Last month, Massachusetts voters rejected a referendum question that would have 
permanently closed Pilgrim and the Yankee plant in Rowe.

THE RAILEY CASE; 
</P>
<P>
THE BRUTAL ATTACK ON THE POPULAR PASTOR'S WIFE AND HIS SUICIDE ATTEMPT BECAME 
DALLAS' MOST HAUNTING AND SENSATIONAL MYSTERY IN A DECADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE COCHRAN, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DALLAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bewildered friends and followers would recall that he looked tired and 
depressed, still grief-stricken and mystified over the savage assault on his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
Little more than a week had passed since he found her comatose on the garage 
floor, choked senseless and left for dead. She had not regained consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in the early evening hours of April 30, 1987, the intense, balding man 
excused himself and disappeared into a private hospital suite. 
</P>
<P>
He locked and chained the door, sat down with pen and paper and began composing 
a chilling letter. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a demon inside my soul," he wrote. "It has always been there. My 
demon tries to lead me down paths I do not want to follow. At times that demon 
has lured me into doing things I do not want to do. 
</P>
<P>
". . . My demon has finally gotten the upper hand." 
</P>
<P>
When security officers broke in the next morning, they found him sprawled 
across the bed. He was alive but unconscious and in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby were empty bottles of prescription drugs and his rambling letter, which 
began with instructions for his funeral and ended thusly: 
</P>
<P>
"I have finally made the decision to take care of myself. I have grown weak. 
God has remained strong. Therein lies your hope. I have none. 
</P>
<P>
"Walker L. Railey." 
</P>
<P>
The vicious attack on Walker Railey's wife and his ensuing suicide attempt 
devastated three families, split a church and outraged a city. 
</P>
<P>
For Peggy Railey was by no means an ordinary homemaker, and her husband was 
perhaps Dallas' most dynamic and socially conscious young minister. At 39, 
Walker Railey reigned as the senior pastor of the city's 6,000-member First 
United Methodist Church and loomed as a rising star in his mainstream 
Protestant denomination. 
</P>
<P>
The news of the suicide attempt swept through town, nowhere more devastatingly 
than at First Methodist, where Railey's flock was already reeling from the 
attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Keep Him in Our Prayers' 
</P>
<P>
His chief assistant, the Rev. Gordon Casad, told the congregation the next 
Sunday, "We must remember our pastor and the troubling of his mind and spirit 
and keep him in our prayers." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Railey was now a suspect, Park Stearns, supervisor in the Dallas FBI 
office, replied: "This is a big no comment." 
</P>
<P>
Although police refused to reveal the contents of Railey's letter, they 
described it as an apparent suicide note. And they redoubled their efforts to 
review with the convalescing minister what happened the night his wife was 
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
A fellow pastor, the Rev. David Shawyer of Plymouth Park Methodist Church, 
said, "I'm praying that it is not what it looks like. I'm praying that what the 
police are suggesting could never be true. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm praying this will all come out some other way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latest Twist in Mystery 
</P>
<P>
Railey's attempt on his own life was only the latest twist in what would be 
called Dallas' most haunting and sensational mystery in a decade. One 
unrestrained commentator called the attempted murder the city's most 
extraordinary crime since the assassination of President Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Railey survived, but only barely so. Comatose, she could not identify her 
assailant. 
</P>
<P>
Several anonymous, typewritten death threats preceded the attack, apparently 
provoked by Railey's strong sermons and public statements against racial 
prejudice and injustice. But friends said Peggy Railey did not frighten easily, 
and she had encouraged her husband not to soften his stand. 
</P>
<P>
The last letter was slipped under the door of a church office just prior to 
Easter Sunday services. It said: "EASTER IS WHEN CHRIST AROSE, BUT YOU ARE 
GOING DOWN." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wore Bulletproof Vest 
</P>
<P>
Under the stern scrutiny of security officers, Railey delivered his Easter 
sermon wearing a bulletproof vest beneath his robes. 
</P>
<P>
It would be his last appearance in the pulpit of First Methodist's historic old 
sanctuary. He hammered the congregation with a theme of death and resurrection 
that morning. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to die," he said, pointing his finger at parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to die," he repeated. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to die." 
</P>
<P>
Police and church officials first theorized that the attempt on Peggy Railey's 
life was some kind of grotesque retaliation for her husband's outspokenness. 
</P>
<P>
With his wife in critical condition, Railey stationed himself outside her 
hospital room, interrupting his vigil only for a trip downtown to give 
investigators an account of his activities the night of April 21. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Noticed Open Garage Door 
</P>
<P>
He said he'd spent the evening doing research at Southern Methodist University 
libraries. Returning home about 12:40 a.m., he said, he noticed that a door to 
the darkened two-car garage was partly open. 
</P>
<P>
Driving inside with his headlights on, he found his wife lying on the floor, 
writhing in convulsions. Her face was puffy and discolored and she was frothing 
at the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
He said the children, Ryan, 5, and Megan, 2, were inside the house and 
unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
After the interview, Capt. John Holt, 37, the tall, sandy-haired supervisor of 
crimes against persons, told reporters the questioning was routine. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any indicators that would point to him as a suspect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arranged for Hospital Suite 
</P>
<P>
Railey returned to the hospital to arrange for a suite near his wife. He spent 
the day greeting a parade of visitors who expressed shock, sorrow and support. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who came to share their grief that day was a striking frosted 
blonde who carried a single red rose and disappeared into Railey's hospital 
suite. 
</P>
<P>
With the investigation in full swing and the FBI trying to identify the source 
of the death threats, Railey continued his hospital vigil under heavy police 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just numb. . . . He's overwhelmed by it," said Ralph Shannon, a longtime 
church member. 
</P>
<P>
If Railey was silent, his ministerial colleagues were not. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Joseph Ofseyer of Congregation Shearith Israel said that Railey had 
suffered for his message of justice and equality but that the religious 
community would not "be cowed into silence" and "permit such a person to stand 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
Almost lost or overlooked in the outcry was an observation by Police Lt. Ron 
Waldrop that the abusive letters appeared to be the work of one individual and 
not the concerted effort of a white supremacist group. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no central theme," he added. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, the FBI determined that the death threats had been written 
on an office typewriter at First Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
Walker Railey's rise to clerical prominence seemed almost preordained from his 
turbulent childhood days in Owensboro, Ky., a coal mining town on the south 
bank of the Ohio River. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest of three children, Railey grew up a nonsmoker and nondrinker who 
delivered his first sermon at age 17 and became something of a circuit preacher 
while a history major at Western Kentucky University. 
</P>
<P>
He attended Vanderbilt Divinity School for a year, then headed to Dallas and 
the Perkins Theological Seminary at Southern Methodist University. 
</P>
<P>
It was there, in 1970, that he met Margaret Nicolai, an equally talented, 
intelligent and religiously dedicated young musician whom everyone called 
Peggy. She had arrived at SMU from Wisconsin to pursue a master's degree in 
organ music. 
</P>
<P>
Acquaintances say Peggy recognized early on that young Walker was a man with 
great ambition and potential but that she was not much taken with him 
romantically. His persistence won her over and the couple were married in 
August, 1971. 
</P>
<P>
After obtaining a doctor of ministry in 1973, Railey ministered to several 
rural churches in Oklahoma and then was appointed an associate pastor at First 
Methodist in Dallas. In 1980, after a stint as a senior minister at a suburban 
Dallas church, he returned to First Methodist as senior pastor at age 33. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eight Ministers Became Bishops 
</P>
<P>
The appointment was the most dramatic step in a meteoric rise. Although not 
even the largest Methodist church in Dallas, First Methodist had the reputation 
as the nation's mother church of Methodism, in no small part because eight of 
its ministers had gone on to become bishops. 
</P>
<P>
Under Railey's leadership, First Methodist grew and prospered, its membership 
approaching 6,000 and its annual budget doubling to $2 million. And although 
Railey himself was short, balding and physically unimposing, his radiant 
ministry served as a magnet for the young, energetic and socially conscious 
while not alienating older, more conservative parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke out boldly against those who practiced or condoned racial intolerance. 
He clashed with a City Council member over what he perceived to be a racist 
stance on illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
He challenged President Reagan to take a "more visible and articulate stand" 
for peace and he once said of fundamentalist Jerry Falwell, "I guarantee he 
doesn't speak for the Kingdom of God, let alone the people in it." 
</P>
<P>
When the threats came, the Raileys seemed to take them in stride. The FBI 
encouraged Peggy Railey and the children to leave town for a while. Although 
she went to her parents' home for four days, she did not seem overly concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Yarrington, wife of First Methodist's minister of music and one of Peggy 
Railey's closest friends, said Peggy told her that she and Walker were taking 
precautions but that they refused to be intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
Long before the attack, the Yarringtons and Raileys pledged to care for one 
another's children in the event of tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
That pledge would soon come due. 
</P>
<P>
As Railey and his wife lay near death in the same intensive care unit, police 
were anxious to talk again with First Methodist's senior pastor. After his 
first interview, police found unspecified "inconsistencies" in Railey's account 
of April 21. 
</P>
<P>
Friends in the church hired a tough, no-nonsense criminal defense attorney 
named Doug Mulder to advise Railey, and as the minister recovered, he wasn't 
talking to police. 
</P>
<P>
He did, however, speak with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest with you . . . I just don't know anything," he told a veteran 
religion reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he told the Associated Press: 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't attack my wife. I didn't plan to have someone attack my wife. I 
didn't orchestrate a plan to attack my wife. And if I had written the letters, 
I wouldn't have written them on a typewriter in the church. But I didn't write 
them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Don't Understand Why' 
</P>
<P>
He could not rationalize his suicide attempt, which he knew was construed by 
some as an admission of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand why I did it, any more than I understand why I lived beyond 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Mulder arranged for a private polygraph test, which indicated that Railey did 
not try to kill his wife. Presumably because of those results, Mulder approved 
a police-administered examination the next day. That exercise was described as 
"inconclusive." 
</P>
<P>
"The results showed that he didn't have anything to do with the attack, nor did 
he conspire with anyone," Mulder said. 
</P>
<P>
Though Railey's followers took new heart, investigators were unimpressed and 
restated the ongoing request to interview him. 
</P>
<P>
Holt accused Mulder of misrepresenting the outcome of the police-administered 
examination. He suggested that some of Railey's responses were "untruthful," 
but refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
All but overlooked in the flap over the polygraphs was an unattributed police 
statement that Railey's account of his activities the night of April 21 was "in 
direct conflict with indisputable evidence." 
</P>
<P>
The key word was "indisputable." 
</P>
<P>
The frosted blonde with the sparkling eyes was no stranger to the congregation 
at First United Methodist Church. Lucy Papillon grew up in the magnificent 
sanctuary, the daughter of the Rev. Robert E. Goodrich Jr., a former senior 
pastor and later a Methodist bishop. 
</P>
<P>
A portrait of Goodrich, who died in 1985, hangs in the First Methodist foyer. 
</P>
<P>
"She had that knotted Goodrich chin, his thin, drawn smile, and the dark eyes 
that were his most distinctive feature -- eyes that seemed remote but also 
searching and intelligent," journalist Larry Wright, a childhood acquaintance, 
wrote in Texas Monthly. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a strong face, like her father's, and if in some lights it appeared 
hard, in others you could detect a vulnerable and even wounded soul who had 
lived past the point where life surprised her." 
</P>
<P>
As a youngster, Lucy played the piano in Sunday school and was a cheerleader at 
an exclusive girls' school. She entered Southern Methodist University in 1959 
to pursue a degree in music education and, four years later, married a 
Methodist preacher. They were divorced in 1973 after she bore two sons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worked Variety of Jobs 
</P>
<P>
Friends say she worked at a variety of jobs, including a stint as a part-time 
model. Somewhere along the way she became enamored with psychology. She married 
and divorced again and, in 1982, received a doctorate in psychology and moved 
to California to complete her training. She found various jobs in her new field 
there and reportedly began to visit the Esalen commune. 
</P>
<P>
And it was there that Lucy decided to take on her identity as "Papillon," 
French for butterfly. In 1986 she opened a private psychology practice in 
Dallas and legally changed her name to Lucy Papillon. 
</P>
<P>
On July 14, 1987, Dallas County's chief prosecutor sat down with police and the 
FBI and heard for the first time all the facts of the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Challenged to 'Talk or Walk' 
</P>
<P>
His face flushed with anger, his thick mustache almost bristling, Norm Kinne, 
53, stormed from the meeting room into a cluster of reporters and challenged 
Walker Railey, as one headline proclaimed, to "talk or walk." 
</P>
<P>
Eyes flashing and his finger jabbing at the nearest of four television cameras, 
Kinne declared: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of this man fooling with the justice system and the life of his 
wife. . . . I'm going to tell you, Walker Railey, I'm tired of you messing with 
the Dallas Police Department, and you're going to come before the Dallas County 
grand jury and you're going to clear up these discrepancies, or you're going to 
leave the country!" 
</P>
<P>
Kinne could subpoena Railey to appear before grand jurors, but he had no way to 
compel him to answer questions if he invoked the constitutional protection 
against self-incrimination. Nor was it in the fiery prosecutor's domain to 
order a reticent Railey out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Photographs Triggered Outburst 
</P>
<P>
But at that moment, nobody was foolhardy enough to argue the issue with Kinne. 
</P>
<P>
Later that evening, a vaguely contrite Kinne said it was the photographs of 
Peggy Railey after the attack that so outraged him and triggered the outburst. 
</P>
<P>
"I got irritated because we have a lady here who is a loving wife and mother 
and who is lying in a hospital more dead than alive," he said. "And we have an 
alleged pillar of the community who will not talk to us about this." 
</P>
<P>
Six days before Kinne's outburst, a Dallas Morning News story linked Lucy 
Papillon to the Railey case, calling her a potential "reluctant witness." 
</P>
<P>
The article said mobile telephone records revealed that Railey called Papillon 
twice the night of the attack. Railey had neglected to mention those calls in 
his lengthy interview with police the morning after April 21. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Calls Placed to Home 
</P>
<P>
Phone records also showed that Railey placed two calls to his own home between 
midnight and 12:30 a.m., the last one about 10 minutes before he reported 
finding his wife near death on the garage floor. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators refused to discuss the significance of the mobile phone records 
but it seemed safe to assume they somehow represented the "indisputable 
evidence" of inconsistencies in Railey's story. 
</P>
<P>
Later, on the eve of a grand jury meeting on the Railey case, the Morning News 
reported that Railey had visited Papillon the night his wife was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the jury room, Kinne was eager to confront Railey, although he was 
certain that the embattled minister would refuse to answer questions and invoke 
his Fifth Amendment rights. Railey took the Fifth -- 43 times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knew Nothing About Attack 
</P>
<P>
"I have followed the advice of my lawyer consistently and will consistently do 
that," Railey remarked brusquely when he emerged from the closed-door session. 
</P>
<P>
Papillon spent an hour before the panel and, according to her attorney, Phil 
Burleson, answered every question. She knew nothing about the attack, Burleson 
said, and then cautioned reporters against drawing conclusions that his client 
was romantically linked with Railey. 
</P>
<P>
But it made no difference. Leaks poured out of the grand jury room that Lucy 
Papillon was Walker Railey's mistress. 
</P>
<P>
According to those present, Papillon told grand jurors she first met Railey on 
a religious television show and they became romantically involved in June, 
1986, about the same time she changed her name. She said she had accompanied 
Railey on several ministerial trips and had vacationed with him in California. 
</P>
<P>
Nor were their liaisons confined to this country. Papillon revealed that Railey 
stopped over for a prearranged rendezvous in London while returning from a 
World Methodist Council meeting in Nairobi, Kenya, in July, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In one particularly chilling disclosure, Lucy said they embraced and kissed in 
Walker's hospital suite while Peggy lay near death nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the sensational revelations, the grand jury testimony raised almost as 
many questions as it answered. And the "indisputable evidence" remained cloaked 
in secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have a lot of discrepancies, but we're not going to discuss them," 
said Police Lt. Waldrop. "There is no statue of limitations on attempted 
murder, and that's how long we'll be working on it." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the discrepancies and the indisputable evidence did unfold. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of the attack, Railey made several calls from a cellular telephone 
installed in his car at church expense only hours earlier as a security measure 
because of anonymous threats. A phone company computer recorded the times. 
</P>
<P>
Railey called home at 5:55 p.m. to say he was leaving the office. At 5:58 p.m., 
he telephoned Papillon and talked for one minute. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving home shortly before 6:30 p.m., Railey said he found his wife working 
on a faulty garage door lock with a bar of soap. Investigators later found no 
trace of soap on the lock, which was working fine. 
</P>
<P>
Railey said he sat on the hood of his wife's Chrysler and talked with her for 
several minutes. He told her he intended to spend the evening on a research 
project at the SMU libraries. He did not change from his business suit and left 
the house a little after 6:30. 
</P>
<P>
At 6:38 p.m., Railey, who never wore a watch, called on the car phone for the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
He said he spent half an hour or so at SMU's Bridwell Library and was back in 
his car by 7:26 p.m., at which time he phoned the family baby-sitter and 
discussed plans for a trip to San Antonio the Raileys planned later in the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:32 p.m., he phoned Papillon at her home near SMU. He drove directly to her 
house, where he spent the next 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Railey Went Back to Library 
</P>
<P>
Railey told a friend later he went there to get some relaxation tapes to help 
relieve stress. 
</P>
<P>
From 8 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., Railey was back at Bridwell, where he asked a 
librarian what time the library closed. At 8:30, Railey, using a pay phone, 
called home on a private line. Peggy Railey told him she was putting the 
children to bed. She then called her parents long distance in Tyler and talked 
from 8:49 p.m. until 9:14 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
At 8:53 p.m., Raily bought gas at a Texaco station near campus. After drinking 
a wine cooler, he said, he returned to Fondren Library, SMU's main library. But 
no one saw him there until after 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
At 9:30 p.m., a jogger in the Raileys' neighborhood spotted a man in a business 
suit and street shoes running through a yard south of the Railey home. Between 
10:15 p.m. and 10:30 p.m., a neighbor heard rustling sounds in the alley behind 
the home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tried to Leave Business Card 
</P>
<P>
Sometime after 11 p.m., a librarian saw Railey at Fondren. Upon leaving at 
midnight, he attempted to give his business card to a student at the checkout 
desk. On the back of the card was a message requesting help in finding research 
information. Railey also noted the time, 10:30 p.m., when in fact it was 
midnight, the student told police. 
</P>
<P>
At 12:03 a.m., Railey called home on the car phone, but this time he used the 
public line. According to friends, the family seldom answered the public line, 
which was connected to an answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, Babe," he said. "I'm calling you from my mobile phone. Peg, it's about, 
oh, I don't know. I don't have a watch. It's somewhere between 10:30 and 10:45, 
somewhere along in there. I worked at Bridwell until they closed and now I'm 
going to Fondren." 
</P>
<P>
This could not have been true. He had in fact just left Fondren, according to 
other accounts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lock the Garage Door' 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be in about 1. If you want to, go ahead and lock the garage door and I'll 
park out front. It really doesn't matter to me at this point. My concern is 
that you're safe. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
This portion of the tape might explain why Peggy Railey would enter the garage 
that night. Even so, Railey would still have to explain why, if he really 
intended to speak with his wife, he had called on the public line and left a 
message. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three minutes later, Railey phoned the answering machine again, and on 
this occasion gave the correct time: 12:29. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, Babe," he began. "It's 12:29 and I'm on the way home from SMU. . . . 
Everything really went well. I got a lot accomplished. I had to leave my card 
with the reference librarian because there was one deal that I couldn't quite 
work out. I'm not calling on the private line because I know you're already 
asleep, but in case you get up with the kids, I just wanted you to know that 
I'm on my way home. It's 12:30. I'll be home about 12:45. 
</P>
<P>
"Love you. Bye-bye." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Sign of a Struggle 
</P>
<P>
At just past 12:40, Railey drove into his driveway and found his wife. 
</P>
<P>
There was no sign of a struggle. There was no skin under her fingernails to 
indicate that she had either fought her assailant or scratched herself when 
grasping at whatever was pulled around her throat. 
</P>
<P>
Railey said he determined that the children were safe and notified police. 
</P>
<P>
"Dallas Emergency, Ms. . . ," the dispatcher answered. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Walker Railey," he interrupted. "Send the paramedics and police, 
please." 
</P>
<P>
An ambulance arrived, along with neighbors. Inside the house, both children 
were in the living room, Megan watching a silent television screen and Ryan 
staring blankly ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Months later, Kinne told a reporter he thought it possible that Ryan witnessed 
the attack, but he said the youngster gave investigators inconsistent accounts 
of what might have happened that night. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Daddy did it," the boy told investigators once. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors transferred Peggy Railey, her body alive but her brain barely 
functioning, from a Dallas hospital to a nursing home in east Texas so she 
could be near her parents. 
</P>
<P>
Bill and Billie Jo Nicolai live in Tyler, but they had spent almost all day 
every day in Dallas, about 60 miles away, attending to Peggy's needs. Though a 
full-service hospital was no longer required, she remained in a vegetative 
state from which she might never awaken. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Dallas, no sign was posted, but the Raileys' home was quietly put on 
the market and sold. 
</P>
<P>
Walker Railey voluntarily surrendered his credentials as a minister in the 
United Methodist Church, and then surrendered control of his wife's legal 
affairs to her parents. He granted temporary custody of his children to the 
friends who had kept them since April 22, John and Diane Yarrington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mother Assumed Guardianship 
</P>
<P>
Billie Jo Nicolai requested that a court grant her guardianship of her 
daughter, and Railey waived his right to continue in that traditionally spousal 
role. 
</P>
<P>
And then, after the stunning developments and disclosures of mid-November, 
Railey vanished. 
</P>
<P>
"I know he has some job prospects," Yarrington said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next few months, Railey and Dallas reporters played a game of 
hide-and-seek. 
</P>
<P>
In early December, Railey told religion reporter Helen Parmley of the Dallas 
Morning News in a telephone interview from California that he fled despair, not 
speculation. And he maintained that he was not abandoning his children. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, while I am relocating, looking for work, financially strapped, 
not knowing where I'm going to end up or what I'm going to be doing, everybody 
involved in this drama believes . . . the most stable, loving, Christian 
environment they can be in is where they are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But before anybody could get themselves too lathered up over Railey's plight, 
Dallas Times Herald columnist Laura Miller put a new slant on the case by 
telling a tale of the anger and indignation of Peggy Railey's family -- her 
father and her grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Both believe Railey was behind the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The motive? "A divorced man doesn't get to be bishop," said the grandmother, 
Ella Renfro. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Wright, a contributing editor at Texas Monthly magazine, grew up in the 
First United Methodist Church in Dallas. His childhood pastor was Robert 
Goodrich Jr., Lucy Papillon's father. 
</P>
<P>
He left the church once in disenchantment but had been drawn back by Railey's 
socially contemporary ministry. Then he had seen the devastation at First 
Methodist after the attack on Peggy, Walker's suicide attempt and the 
minister's affair with Lucy. 
</P>
<P>
So Wright was less a journalist than a confused and angry member of the 
congregation when he confronted Railey. 
</P>
<P>
Did Peggy know about his affair with Lucy? 
</P>
<P>
"We -- that never came up," Railey stammered. 
</P>
<P>
She didn't know? 
</P>
<P>
"I can only say it never emerged." 
</P>
<P>
Did she suspect? 
</P>
<P>
"I have no way of knowing, regarding that, that she suspected at all, about 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Changing the subject, Railey revealed he had slipped into the First Methodist 
sanctuary to attend funeral services for a family friend. Some of his former 
parishioners avoided him but most embraced him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Could Feel Pain' 
</P>
<P>
"They could feel my pain," Railey said, crying. He said he also felt love. 
</P>
<P>
Did you feel a sense of shame, Wright asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt a great need to be forgiven, if that's what you're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Wright decided that was as much of a concession as he was likely to get. But 
before departing, he said he could not construct an innocent man out of 
Railey's behavior. The journalist recounted Railey's misleading testimony to 
the police, his avoidance of the grand jury and his inexplicable actions on the 
night of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Think You Are Guilty' 
</P>
<P>
"I think you are a guilty person," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear what you're saying," Railey replied. 
</P>
<P>
Wright did not know what to think. Railey failed to absorb his blunt 
accusation, choosing instead to analyze it with detachment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm aware that nobody can sit down with all the facts that are supposedly 
known . . . and just make it all fit. That's a frustration that everyone has 
felt, including me," Railey said. 
</P>
<P>
"Confess," Wright urged him. "It will haunt you forever, it will drive you 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if that's a word of advice, a backhand comfort or what," Railey 
said. "I'm not guilty. I didn't do it. I don't feel tormented by the guilt of 
what I didn't do." 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 2, Billie Jo Nicolai filed a legal bombshell in civil court, accusing 
Railey of "maliciously" attempting to kill his wife and orchestrating a "clumsy 
attempt" to cover his actions with a phony alibi. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit sought damages for "physical and mental pain, disfigurement, 
anguish and physical impairment" on behalf of Mrs. Nicolai's comatose daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Concern over the cost of Peggy Railey's medical expenses was the overriding 
reason for the action, but the family's decision was also emotional, said 
Billie Jo Nicolai's attorney, Bill Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Are Bitter' 
</P>
<P>
"They are bitter," he said. "They are angry." 
</P>
<P>
Ted Nicolai, Peggy's younger brother, revealed that Railey had visited his wife 
no more than three times and that after a Christmas visit with his two 
children, Ryan had suffered severe emotional problems. 
</P>
<P>
Kinne, Dallas' chief prosecutor, had sent an investigator to question Ryan 
about the night of April 21, and the youngster talked freely about almost 
everything. But whenever the investigator asked about the attack, Ryan would 
tune her out. He would turn his back and try to leave the room. 
</P>
<P>
Railey moved to California, to a Victorian flat not far from San Francisco Bay. 
The rent reportedly was $1,600, and both he and Papillon signed the lease. 
</P>
<P>
Initial attempts to serve Railey with legal notice of the Nicolai civil suit 
were unsuccessful. Eventually, he was spotted at a hotel, and papers were 
slapped under the windshield wiper of a car driven by Papillon, with Railey 
apparently slumped down inside. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely one year after the events of April, 1987, a state district judge 
ruled that Walker Railey "intentionally, knowingly, maliciously and brutally 
attempted to strangle his wife" and cover up his actions with a "false alibi." 
</P>
<P>
Judge John Whittington issued a preliminary civil judgment on April 22, 1988, 
holding Railey financially liable for the injuries to his wife. The extent of 
damages would be determined later by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, although significant, had no bearing on the criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Whittington's action came after Railey failed to respond to legal notices of 
the suit. The judge said Railey, by his technical default, had admitted all the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fled Bay Area 
</P>
<P>
Railey could no longer be found. Under siege from the media, he broke the lease 
on the San Francisco "love nest" he shared with Papillon on her visits from 
Dallas. It appeared he had fled the Bay Area altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"The court can issue a subpoena that compels him to come answer my questions," 
Arnold said. "But today, I have less of an idea where he is than at any time 
since this case started." 
</P>
<P>
In June, doctors reported a slight improvement in Peggy Railey's condition and 
she was returned to Dallas and placed in the Baylor Institute for 
Rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. William Parker, the institute's medical director, said she could turn her 
head and hear, but could not process what she heard. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can establish anything that seems to stimulate a response that could be 
interpreted as functional, then we would continue to try, through repetition, 
to improve on that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Condition Downgraded 
</P>
<P>
Parker said he didn't think his team of specialists would be able to determine 
whether Peggy Railey would ever communicate again. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the odds are probably going to be against it, but time is the only 
thing that's going to tell," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After more than a year in a vegetative state, doctors downgraded her condition 
to a "persistent vegetative state," meaning, as a neurosurgeon explained, that 
her chances for recovery were "nil." 
</P>
<P>
After two months in Dallas, she was quietly returned to the nursing home in 
Tyler where her parents resumed their tender, but apparently hopeless, daily 
care. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Kinne sat puffing his pipe in the district attorney's office and 
reflecting on the Railey case, his opinions no less candid than when he first 
viewed the terrible pictures of Peggy Railey's wounds. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy's a liar," Kinne said. "He's trying to cover his tracks. He wasn't 
where he was at the time he says he was. Now the question is, if he wasn't 
there, where was he? 
</P>
<P>
"The conclusion that everybody's drawn is that he was home choking out his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
"But that doesn't necessarily follow. There's no proof he was at the scene at 
the time she was strangled. There's no evidence that he strangled her or that 
he knew who strangled her or that he arranged or participated in any way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Concrete Evidence 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say Kinne didn't think about prosecuting Walker Railey. He 
visualized presenting all the evidence that showed Railey lied, that he 
contrived an alibi and that he told no one of visiting his girlfriend that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
But with a defense move for an instructed verdict of innocent, the judge might 
ask, "Where is the evidence that he choked his wife?" Kinne said. 
</P>
<P>
The trial would probably be over before it began. 
</P>
<P>
As 1988 drew to an end, Kinne had not surrendered hope that the case might 
someday be solved, but any possibility was a long shot. Peggy Railey might 
miraculously recover and identify her assailant, or even young Ryan Railey 
might have seen something and be able to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nothing Incriminating 
</P>
<P>
Lucy Papillon might eventually shed light on the case, but Kinne once pointed 
out that she had said nothing incriminating "since we don't have adultery laws 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
For Kinne, Walker Railey remained the ultimate enigma. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing you'd expect from a guy like him would be to give up his wife 
and kids and flit off to California. Just say to hell with it and take off. 
It's just not what you'd expect from a man of his stature. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives every indication of guilt, whether he is guilty or not." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Railey Didn't Show 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 5, Judge Whittington heard testimony in a one-day trial to determine if 
Walker Railey should pay damages to the Nicolai family. Railey didn't show up. 
</P>
<P>
The family was awarded $16 million -- half to cover Peggy's care, half to 
punish Railey. It was a ruling more of symbolism than substance, a hollow 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said he didn't know where Railey was, or how much money he had. He 
doubted that his wife's family would ever collect the $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
On videotape, the court watched therapists treating Peggy Railey, who has 
virtually no body control and a haunting, lifeless look in her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, her sister-in-law, Linda Nicolai, told of an experience at the hospital

The Queen of England rewarded 907 people, from a beekeeper to a banker to 
ex-Trade and Industry Minister Leon Brittan, with titles or medals in her 
traditional New Year's honors list. Brittan, who resigned after leaking a 
secret document in 1986, was granted a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II, as was 
sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi. Also on the list, mostly compiled on the 
recommendation of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government, were newly 
dubbed knight Evelyn de Rothschild, chairman of N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons and 
a member of the well-known banking family's British branch, and British 
Beekeeping Society Vice Chairman William Hooper, named a Member of the Order of 
the British Empire. Actor Peter Cushing, known for horror films and for 
portraying Sherlock Holmes, was made an Officer of the Order. Among several 
athletes honored was six-time world darts champion Eric Bristow, who became a 
Member of the Order and the first in his field to be so recognized.

 -- Bandleader Cab Calloway, who had to cancel a New Year's Eve appearance in 
Chicago because of illness, relayed greetings to his fans through his wife, 
Nuffie. "I wish everyone a Happy New Year," she quoted the "prince of hi-de-ho" 
as saying after she visited him at White Plains (N.Y.) Hospital Center. 
Calloway has been listed in critical but stable condition since emergency 
surgery for unspecified abdominal troubles that caused him to collapse Dec. 21 
during a concert tour in Japan. Nuffie Calloway said her husband, 81, "thanks 
everyone for their calls, flowers, letters and expressions of love, and he 
expects to feel better any minute."

 -- As he packed up office memorabilia recently in Newark, N.J., retiring 
Democratic Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr. looked back on his 40 years in Congress. He 
recalled rushing past reporters after the Judiciary Committee he chaired voted 
articles of impeachment against President Richard M. Nixon in 1974, saying he 
went into a cubbyhole office, telephoned his wife and wept. Rodino, 79, pointed 
proudly to photographs of himself with President John F. Kennedy and his 
brother Robert, President Lyndon B. Johnson and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
Democrat Donald M. Payne will succeed Rodino, becoming the state's first black 
congressman. DAVE JOHNSON

KEEPING PETRODOLLARS AT HOME; 
</P>
<P>
SAUDIS MAKING EFFORT TO BOOST REGIONAL TOURISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Saudis, fewer petrodollars in their pockets and worried about security and 
culture shock, have started looking for holidays at home and finding that there 
is more to the country than sand. 
</P>
<P>
In the oil price heyday of the 1970s, Saudi Muslims flocked to the kingdom's 
air terminals to escape the heat and monotony of the desert for the great 
tourist capitals -- Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles, the French and 
Spanish Rivieras, Istanbul and Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
But local tourism has been on the rise for the last five years, spearheaded by 
a government campaign to encourage Saudis to spend their vacation dollars at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"There are quite a lot of religiously conservative families who suffer when 
they go abroad," said Ibrahim al Sayed, director general of tourism development 
in the country's mountainous southwest Asir region. "They don't want their 
teen-agers to copy Westerners." 
</P>
<P>
He added that many Saudis are also acutely aware that language and cultural 
barriers make them attractive victims for con artists abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"I've traveled in Europe and I've faced some of the troubles," said Fahd al 
Sayejh, public relations manager at the Riyadh Intercontinental Hotel. "My 
family's now looking for a villa in Abha (in the cooler Asir region). There are 
many people who spend their summers there who used to go to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"It's beautiful. It reminds us of the old days when we used to go to Lebanon 
every summer. The mountains are the same," he added. "(But) in the oil boom 
years, businessmen thought nothing of driving to the airport and boarding any 
available international flight. Now people are more aware of spending their 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Tourism within Saudi Arabia may seem like a hard sell, given the country's 
reputation as a "desert kingdom," lacking much in the way of amusement. 
</P>
<P>
But beaches along the country's eastern border on the Persian Gulf draw big 
crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Jidda on the Red Sea attracts scuba-diving enthusiasts and Najran, close to 
Yemen, offers unusual architecture. For a change of scenery, many tourists try 
the southwest. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole southwest area is very popular," said Antoni Kuhnen, who runs the 
Al-Baha Motel in that region. Kuhnen estimates that the motel, opened in 1985, 
now books around 20,000 tourists a year. 
</P>
<P>
Al-Baha, Saudi Arabia's smallest province, is situated between Taif, where the 
government retreats into the mountains for the summer months, and Abha, capital 
of Asir province, which boasts 1,736 square miles of national park. 
</P>
<P>
A local newspaper noted that "visitors to the Abha region reached an 
unprecedented number, to the extent that the real estate offices in Abha cannot 
cope with the great demand for furnished and unfurnished flats." 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 800,000 visitors were reported to have made it despite a 
relatively small airport. 
</P>
<P>
The recent popularity of in-country tourism is due largely to the government. 
Five years ago, the few tourists who came to this region had to either camp out 
or rely on the kindness of strangers for accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
Now, there are five hotels in the area, some of them bankrolled by the Finance 
Ministry. Private businessmen are also being encouraged to invest in tourism. 
</P>
<P>
An amusement park would make the area more attractive to Saudi families who 
generally have large numbers of children to entertain, he said. Land has 
already been allocated, but awaits an investor. 
</P>
<P>
Al-Baha does not lack scenic beauty. At nearly 10,000 feet above sea level, the 
air is cool, crisp, and a bit damp -- a welcome change from just about anyplace 
else in the kingdom during the summer months. 
</P>
<P>
The mountains, rough, craggy, and dotted with scrubby green plants, rise 
dramatically out of the Tihama Valley and are populated by shepherds tending 
flocks of sheep and goats. Baboons lope down the mountainside, carrying scraps 
of food fed to them by motel staff and early rising guests. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the facilities are there, the tourists will come," said Kuhnen, who 
nonetheless believes the region suffers for lack of recreational diversions.

BRAZIL'S FISHERMEN -- JANGADEIROS -- CLING TO TRADITION AS THEY REAP SEA'S 
BOUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER ATWOOD, Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
FORTALEZA, Brazil 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just before sunset, the fishermen sail into Fortaleza Harbor on their rafts and 
dump the day's catch of mackerel, moray eels and red snappers on the sand. 
People gather around shouting their bids. 
</P>
<P>
Fisherman Raminundo Nonato Tavares comes away with 13,000 cruzados (about $13) 
-- not bad for a day's work, but nothing like the old times. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a boy, we'd fish for half the time we do now and catch twice as 
much," said Tavares, who is 40 but whose weather-beaten face looks years older. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to come to port with the boat weighing low in the water from all the 
fish," Tavares said during a recent visit. 
</P>
<P>
Tavares is one of thousands of men on Brazil's northeast coast who for years 
have been fishing on jangadas, or small wooden rafts, but who now see their 
livelihood disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
Overfishing by big commercial trawlers and a boom in the shrimp trade, which 
kills tons of fish, have been cutting into their catch and forcing many to seek 
steadier work on trawlers. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 jangadas now sail out of Fortaleza Harbor, where 20 years ago there 
were about double that number, said Wilson Goncalves, president of the local 
fishermen's union in this city of 1.3 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Work is risky on a jangada, not much bigger than a double bed and powered only 
by the wind, and the fishing season lasts only six months a year, as the sea is 
too stormy in winter. 
</P>
<P>
But jangadeiros, as the fishermen are known, cling to tradition. 
</P>
<P>
They refuse the usual equipment for commercial fishing like motors, nets and 
compasses, relying entirely on hook and line and a knowledge passed down from 
generations of how to find the fish. 
</P>
<P>
Most are illiterate and, since their early teens, have never changed their 
routine of sailing out to sea before dawn and returning before sunset. 
</P>
<P>
They bring most of their catch home to their families and sell the rest to tide 
them over during the winter months. 
</P>
<P>
"The jangadeiro does not understand or want technology. He's a subsistence 
fishermen who will rely on custom until the day he dies," said Goncalves. 
</P>
<P>
Custom has well-served Tavares and other jangadeiros for generations. 
</P>
<P>
He can tell by the color of the water which fish will be most plentiful in a 
certain area. Darker, deeper water suggests the presence of mackerel, grouper 
and -- if it's a lucky day -- shark. 
</P>
<P>
A green hue often means a coral reef lies below, and that means the moray eel, 
which will bring Tavares a high price because of its tasty meat and because 
trawlers using nets rarely snare them. 
</P>
<P>
Using the weather, ocean currents and even the phases of the moon as his 
guides, he says, he can almost always find the kind of fish he is seeking. 
</P>
<P>
"My father taught me most of it, but some of it I had to learn myself. The sea 
is always changing," he said as he cast his line in a place that he thought 
would yield red snapper, a small, ruddy fish. Within half an hour, he had 
caught five. 
</P>
<P>
But the 20th Century is closing in on the jangadeiros, who bitterly resent the 
commercial trawlers they say are emptying their waters of fish. 
</P>
<P>
"So many fish in the ocean, and our share is so small after the fishing boats 
come through," said Francisco dos Reis, who often joins Tavares on his craft. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to be able to fill that basket with fish. Now we're lucky if we can 
fill it halfway after a whole day at sea," Dos Reis said. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the drop in their catch is the boom in Fortaleza's shrimp 
industry, which exports heavily to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
When shrimp fishermen haul in their nets, they also bring in thousands of fish 
that have gotten entangled and died. The fishermen throw them overboard 
because, unlike the shrimp, fish won't bring in coveted export dollars.

FORGOTTEN TRIBES OF LEBANON'S WADI KHALED THRIVE ON SMUGGLING OF GOODS TO SYRIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<P>
WADI KHALED, Lebanon 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trapped in this northern Lebanese valley, a forgotten community living by 
tribal traditions thrives on smuggling goods across the river to Syria. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the affluence this has brought, the Bedouins of Wadi Khaled feel as if 
they are prisoners in their own land, captive because of a historical mishap 
that left them with no citizenship rights. Their status has been "under study" 
since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 years ago, the tribes' fear of officials drove the people to hide 
in the woods. They missed Lebanon's only official census, conducted in 1932 
when the country was still under French mandate. No population count has been 
carried out since, so the status of the residents of Wadi Khaled is still 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
Abu Mustapha, clad in traditional Arab headdress and gray gallabia, or 
ankle-length shirt, said the tribesmen mistook census officials for envoys of 
the Ottoman Empire authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"They hid in the woods because they were afraid their children would be drafted 
into the Ottoman army. They were illiterate people and did not understand that 
we were not under Ottoman rule anymore," said Abu Mustapha. 
</P>
<P>
The Bedouins of Wadi Khaled hold residence permits, issued to all foreigners 
living in Lebanon, and a document which classifies them in a "citizenship under 
study" category. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Palestinians and other refugees in Lebanon who have a special travel 
document, these tribesmen have no passports and can travel almost nowhere. 
Syria is the only country that allows them inside its borders, just for brief 
visits. 
</P>
<P>
"We have become prisoners in our own land," said Sweid. 
</P>
<P>
The people of Wadi Khaled -- named after Khaled Ibn al-Walid, who drove out the 
Byzantine Christians -- are divided into tribes who trace their origin to what 
is now Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Until the 1960s, they raised sheep in the bare rugged hills nearby. Then they 
turned to trade. 
</P>
<P>
"We are on the border between a socialist country (Syria) and a country that 
believes in free trade (Lebanon)," said Bashir Hammoud. 
</P>
<P>
Syria has strict import controls and the smuggled traffic across the Nahr 
el-Bared river into the country includes television sets, radios, videos, 
fruit, vegetables, canned food, coffee, sugar, building material, clothes and 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Wadi Khaled's marketplace, Al-Arida, is a favorite of Syrian families, with 
prices given in Syrian pounds that the merchants later change to dollars at the 
rate of 46 to a dollar. 
</P>
<P>
"We sell here what Syrians can only buy on the black market in their country. 
Everything they do not have they buy here," said Hammoud. 
</P>
<P>
The Ghannam tribe, the largest and most influential, boasts that its standard 
of living is higher than that of many people in the Lebanese capital, Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Most of its members live in spacious cement houses with almost no furniture. 
They traditionally prefer sitting on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Khaled Sweid, who holds a degree in mathematics, estimated that each family in 
the Ghannam tribe earned an average of about $200 per month compared to the 
national minimum wage of $30 per month. 
</P>
<P>
The residents of Wadi Khaled, all Sunni Muslims, have pleaded their case with 
all the governments that have ruled Lebanon since independence in 1943, but to 
no avail. 
</P>
<P>
Christian politicians, who hold key posts in the government, have resisted 
naturalizing 10,000 Muslims because it could upset the sectarian balance in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"Our plight became the subject of bickering among politicians," said a Ghannam 
tribesman, one of a group squatting in a smoke-filled room and sharing a meal 
of lamb and rice. 
</P>
<P>
"The solution for us lies with the Lebanese government. But now which one do we 
turn to?"

AT $80 PER MUSHROOM, PRICE FOR MATSUTAKE IS HIGH EVEN FOR THE JAPANESE 
</P>

<P>
In the land of $7 apples and $6 boxes of granola, matsutake mushrooms are in a 
class of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese drop their usual tones of careful politeness and become positively 
rapturous in describing these unassuming brown fungi, their woodsy taste and 
piney smell. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of one of the world's most exclusive restaurants, Kicho, where meals 
can run $800 a person and only an introduction from a previous customer can win 
a reservation, recently wrote: "In autumn we can almost not do our business 
without matsutake." 
</P>
<P>
But for the uninitiated, it is the price tag of the matsutake, or pine-tree 
mushrooms, that is so breathtaking: a few inches high and, in fact, rather 
mushroom-like in appearance, a single well-shaped matsutake can cost as much as 
$80; even an average one will run $40 per stem. 
</P>
<P>
Matsutake are so pricey and so prized that matsutake fraud has now entered the 
Japanese lexicon. Recently it was discovered that some of these mushrooms were 
being sold with tiny lead slivers inserted in their stems to inflate their 
weight and thus their asking price. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worth It to Japanese 
</P>
<P>
For the Japanese, who adore all manner of mushrooms and use about half a dozen 
different varieties in their everyday food, the price is clearly worth it. "I 
love them," a Japanese newspaper editor said recently, as he dropped the 
subject at hand -- stock market manipulation -- to wax eloquent about 
matsutake. 
</P>
<P>
A Japanese folk saying sums up the emotionalism toward matsutake: "The mountain 
where you picked matsutake cannot be forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
With this saying in mind, a farming community troubled by a high rate of 
bachelorhood among its young men recently held a matsutake-picking party in an 
effort to entice women back to the farm. 
</P>
<P>
According to mushroom connoisseurs, matsutake are expensive because their 
season is short -- just a few weeks in late fall -- and because they can grow 
only in the wild. Japan's wilderness has been disappearing steadily in the face 
of relentless urbanization, and the red pine trees around which matsutake 
flourish have also been diminishing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Domesticated Yet 
</P>
<P>
The finest scientists have failed so far to domesticate the matsutake on a mass 
scale, despite repeated efforts. Mie Ogoshi of Japan's Tsuji Cooking School 
said that matsutake were much more common and much cheaper 20 years ago and 
were used liberally in the kitchen. Now, however, they are rationed 
parsimoniously: paper-thin slices in a special broth, a few bits mixed in a 
rice dish or a few grilled with a touch of lime and soy sauce. One special soup 
features a little matsutake with a touch of real gold shavings. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for matsutake is so strong that the import-resistant Japanese have 
turned to South Korea and China, where matsutake also grow and cost much less. 
</P>
<P>
Mushroom aficionados insist that these imports do not taste as good as local 
ones; among other drawbacks, to satisfy customs inspectors the matsutake must 
be washed well, which attenuates their aroma, they say. Nonetheless, every 
fall, die-hard matsutake lovers figure that it is worth the price of a 
Tokyo-Seoul round-trip ticket (about $500) to fill a few boxes with fresh 
Korean matsutake and lovingly carry them home. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even in affluent Japan, there are many who find $80 per mushroom a bit 
rich for the blood. One Japanese woman who raved about the taste and autumnal 
smell of matsutake admitted, after calming down, that she had not bought one in 
15 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like They Are Gold' 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the price tag on the matsutake, it is like they are gold," 
acknowledged Ogoshi, of the cooking school. And like many high-priced foods in 
Japan, including the beautiful cantaloupe grown here and sold, individually 
wrapped, for $80 or more, matsutake most often are given as presents. 
</P>
<P>
For those who love their matsutake but cannot afford them, one enterprising 
Japanese company recently developed "essence of matsutake," a small vial of 
which costs only $2.50. The liquid can be poured on top of the lowly shiitake 
or ma-shu-ru-mu (white American-style mushroom), allowing the diner to imagine 
it is the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
For the truly desperate, stores sell a few slices of matsutake for the 
comparatively reasonable price of $20. When sniffed very closely they do give 
off a piney odor. Cooked -- one minute in a hot broiler or over a fire, with 
drop of a little lime juice -- they taste, well, like a mushroom.

In northeastern Afghanistan, small numbers of returned refugees have been 
rebuilding their homes and replanting their terraced fields. 
</P>
<P>
But not all the fields returned to the plow in the last year have been planted 
with wheat and corn. Many -- perhaps one out of every two -- were turned over 
to the cultivation of marijuana and opium-producing poppies. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many Western narcotics control officials, diplomats, some members of 
the Afghan resistance, and Pakistani officials, are concerned that this region 
could develop into the world's leading producer of heroin -- the potent drug 
derived from opium. 
</P>
<P>
The primary source of opium for the West remains Southeast Asia's "Golden 
Triangle" -- Burma, Laos, and Thailand. But since the mid-1980s, international 
narcotics control sources say, the "Golden Crescent" of Southwest Asia has 
gained prominence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
30% of Market 
</P>
<P>
Together, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran account for at least 30% of the 
United States heroin market, these sources estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan, according to narcotics officials, is the region's largest 
producer. Last year's opium crop is estimated at between 500 and 700 tons. The 
1988-89 poppy season, which normally begins with the first rains in December, 
is expected to increase output by 100 to 200 tons. The reasons for 
Afghanistan's increased production include: lack of government control in much 
of the countryside during the nine-year war against Soviet occupation; 
crackdowns on cultivation in Pakistan, which have made Afghanistan a safer 
production center; Tehran's apparent willingness to allow trafficking through 
Iran; and growing demand in neighboring Pakistan and the West. 
</P>
<P>
For many peasants, white-and-pink poppy flowers are the easiest and most 
lucrative cash crop. Harvesting the sticky, black sap can bring a small farmer 
up to $2,000 -- a fortune in this area. Dealers take the opium by horse and 
mule across the border into Pakistan's tribal border districts; there, scores 
of illicit laboratories process the opium into heroin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult to Control 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have to be Adam Smith to realize we have a problem," says Carlo 
Boccia, a representative of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Paris. 
"When drugs become more readily available, they become more difficult to 
control." 
</P>
<P>
Western narcotics officials say they do not know how much of Iran's 
"tremendous" poppy production reaches the international market. Pakistan is 
believed to have produced 200 or more tons of opium last year. Most of the 
region's heroin is manufactured in Pakistani labs. (Ten pounds of opium produce 
about one pound of pure heroin, which can sell for tens of thousands to a few 
hundred thousand dollars in the West. Heroin sold in the West is diluted, about 
5% pure.) 
</P>
<P>
One of the most severe effects of this rapidly growing regional trade, Western 
aid officials and other sources say, is its corrupting and undermining 
influence on Pakistani and Afghan society. They cite: 
</P>
<P>
* A rise in the number of Pakistani addicts, most of whom "chase the drag-on" 
(smoke heroin), from an estimated 200,000 in the early 1980s to between 1 
million to 3 million today. 
</P>
<P>
* The spread of heroin abuse among Pakistan's 3 million Afghan refugees. 
</P>
<P>
* Corruption that involves senior Pakistan government officials, Army officers, 
politicians, refugee administrators, businessmen, tribal leaders, and members 
of the Afghan resistance. This was alleged separately by narcotics and 
intelligence officials, and Western aid sources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gang Warfare Feared 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are fears that the "drug and gun culture" on both sides of 
the border could increase gang warfare. "You have got to understand that it is 
a huge business in this part of the world. There are terrible things going on, 
and they involve a lot of people," says a worried representative of the Afghan 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's new prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, has described illegal drugs as 
the country's "No. 1 problem" and has created a Ministry of Narcotics to tackle 
it. Diplomats and aid workers are skeptical about chances for success. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason we have not yet seen the sort of violence you find in Colombia 
(South America) is that enough people here are getting paid off to keep the 
trade going," a Western aid official says. "The moment you start hitting where 
it hurts, the situation will start getting nasty." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Route Through Karachi 
</P>
<P>
Narcotics from eastern and northern Afghanistan and Pakistan's border areas are 
channeled to Karachi; those from southern Afghanistan go toward Iran. 
</P>
<P>
According to aid sources, trucks from the government-run National Logistics 
Corporation, which normally carry goods to Afghan refugee camps, often take 
heroin to Karachi. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of direct collaboration with the police, the Army, and the 
refugee administration," says a Western official. 
</P>
<P>
For appearances, sources say, a vehicle is sometimes deliberately sacrificed to 
the police. The rest then proceed unhindered to Karachi, where the heroin is 
taken by boat or plane to the Mideast and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Berlin an Entry Point 
</P>
<P>
Some sources allege that officials in Pakistan's National Shipping Company are 
involved. Narcotics officials say East Berlin, a drugs gateway in the 1970s, is 
once again becoming a major entry point. 
</P>
<P>
The production of opium in southwest Afghanistan has come under the control of 
local drug lords, cooperating closely with Pakistani traffickers as well as 
drug syndicates from Europe and North America, intelligence sources say. 
</P>
<P>
At Musa Qala, a fertile region in southern Afghanistan, poppy growing is 
largely run by Nassim Akhun Zada, say journalists and relief workers who have 
visited the area. Zada is a guerrilla commander, reportedly still affiliated 
with an Afghan resistance party, the Harakat-i-Inqilab-i-Islami, but who 
operates largely on his own. Western sources say Zada leads a private army of 
1,200 fighters. Recently, there have been reports of pitched battles with a 
rival, Abdul Rahman Khan of the Hizb-i-Islami resistance party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government Role Seen 
</P>
<P>
From Musa Qala, part of the opium harvest is transported to eastern Iran. But 
most is taken to the Pakistani desert refugee camps at Gerde-Jangal. There, 
resistance and aid sources say, trafficking is carried out in collaboration 
with officers of Pakistan's Interservices Intelligence (ISI) organization. 
</P>
<P>
At Gerde-Jangal, the opium is weighed and some is processed by local labs. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much dealing going on that the money is not counted but weighed," 
a Western aid representative says. Various sources, including a former 
trafficker from Quetta, say narcotics are driven in five-vehicle convoys -- two 
carrying drugs, the other three armed guards and heavy machine guns -- through 
government checkpoints, to Robat. 
</P>
<P>
Robat is believed to have 20 or more heroin labs, from which the drug is driven 
in armed convoys across southern Iran to Turkey and on to Europe and America. 
</P>
<P>
Sources say the Robat operations involve members of at least three Afghan 
resistance parties. It is uncertain whether party officials in Quetta and 
Peshawar are linked to the trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Foreigners are forbidden to enter Robat "for security reasons." Some sources 
claim that the aim is to prevent outsiders from witnessing what goes on. 
</P>
<P>
"It is perfectly obvious that this trafficking could not proceed without the 
full knowledge of the ISI (Interservices Intelligence) and the local Pakistani 
authorities," a West European diplomat says.

A SAD BUT GROWING PHENOMENON;

CHINA COPES WITH ITS UNWANTED BABIES

<P>
Shen Xiaozhi, a 2-month-old foundling with a growth the size of a grapefruit on 
her back, is one of the lucky ones. She is being looked after in the 
well-equiped Beijing Children's Welfare Institute. But many of the thousands of 
unwanted babies being left in big cities in railway stations, outside 
hospitals, on docksides and even tossed on rubbish heaps cannot expect to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
It is a phenomenon that has grown steadily in recent years, partly as a result 
of the one-child policy but also because as social controls have loosened, 
China's rural population has become more mobile. 
</P>
<P>
The temptation for Chinese peasants to abandon their physically handicapped 
babies in big cities where there is at least a chance of getting the right 
medical care and treatment is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notes, Money Attached 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the babies are found with money or notes attached to them but never 
with the parents' address," said Ye Tieliang, director of the Beijing Children 
Welfare Institute, the city's only state-run orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
According to the People's Daily, about 50 foundlings are left at Beijing's 
capacious and overcrowded railway station each year and similar numbers are 
left at other major stations. Between 1986 and 1987, nearly 700 foundlings were 
picked up in Canton city while an investigation in five of the province's 
counties showed that 862 babies were picked up. 
</P>
<P>
The babies are frequently female or suffering from Down's Syndrome, broken 
backs, deafness, blindness -- or even such easily cured defects as harelips. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Many Never Survive' 
</P>
<P>
Unofficial sources claimed, however, that the problem is far greater than is 
being admitted with thousands of children being left in Beijing alone. "Most of 
them never survive. They are usually too weak and they are an unwanted burden," 
the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year the legal newspapers said that in 15 months, 25 vagrants had 
been found dead at Beijing's railway station. The issue is highly sensitive and 
public security officials, who are responsible for handling the unwanted 
babies, declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Ye denied a People's Daily report that his institute received 141 handicapped 
foundlings last year. However, the Beijing municipal authorities have issued a 
circular warning people they will face prosecution if they abandon a child, an 
act that contravenes the constitution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rewards Offered 
</P>
<P>
Rewards are being offered to people who help locate parents of the foundlings. 
Only 1.8% of the country's 10 million disabled children receive special care in 
child welfare institutions set up in the country's urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, there are 60 state-run child-welfare institutions that can provide 
reasonable service on a long-term basis to 11,000 disabled children in urban 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Institute appears to serve primarily handicapped children in return 
for financial donations. At the Tianjin children's welfare institute, officials 
say that what was originally designed for orphans has become "an abandoned 
babies" collecting house. 
</P>
<P>
"The cruel-hearted parents threw out their babies who were handicapped but they 
had money to buy refrigerators and color TV sets, so why didn't they send these 
children to hospital?" an official at Tianjin was quoted by the People's Daily. 
Few of the orphans are adopted and the Tianjin children's institute says it can 
no longer afford to pay for so many children's medical fees.

PRIEST'S OUSTER SILENCES HAITI'S VOICE OF THE POOR 
</P>

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The expulsion of a radical slum priest from his ecclesiastic order has silenced 
Haiti's most influential voice for the rights of the nation's poor. 
</P>
<P>
In expelling Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the conservative Salesian Order 
accused the populist Roman Catholic cleric of fomenting class warfare, calling 
him a "protagonist of destabilization." 
</P>
<P>
His ouster was announced Dec. 15 in a statement from Rome. Although Aristide 
remains a priest, he cannot officiate at Mass or deliver sermons over church 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been neutralized," said sociologist Franklyn Midi. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outspoken Campaigner 
</P>
<P>
Aristide, 35, a Salesian priest since 1975, has been one of the most outspoken 
campaigners for social justice in a country ruled for nearly its entire 
184-year existence by dictators. 
</P>
<P>
He has escaped at least three attempts on his life, including a Sept. 11 attack 
at his St. Jean Bosco Church in a Port-au-Prince slum in which thugs armed with 
machetes, guns, clubs and spears killed 12 people and wounded at least 70 
others. 
</P>
<P>
One week later, rank-and-file soldiers overthrew Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy in a 
coup that put Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril in power. Coup leaders said they wanted 
democratic reforms and an end to state-sponsored violence, citing the church 
massacre as an example. 
</P>
<P>
Salesian officials expelled Aristide after he failed to obey their order to 
leave Haiti by Oct. 17 and assume a new post in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular Protests 
</P>
<P>
Two previous transfer orders were rescinded because of popular protests. 
Thousands protested in support of Aristide for several days in October, but 
there were no immediate demonstrations after the expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
Aristide, who has been seen in public only once since the church massacre, has 
made no public statement and has declined requests for interviews. But friends 
say his morale is excellent and he might appeal the church decision. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its condemnation of military brutality and human-rights abuses in 
Haiti, the Catholic hierarchy has long opposed Aristide's political 
proselytizing of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
A proponent of liberation theology, which advocates church involvement in a 
political struggle by the poor against social injustice, Aristide preaches 
"active nonviolence." He urges a "real revolution" to bring democracy to Haiti, 
but does not specifically propose an armed uprising. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fire and Brimstone 
</P>
<P>
His pulpit style is that of a fire-and-brimstone preacher whose leading 
questions prompt quick responses from the congregation. The sermons were 
broadcast nationwide and earned Aristide a huge following among the urban poor 
and the rural peasantry, who call the bespectacled ascetic their "prophet." 
</P>
<P>
Although civic leaders and many priests applauded Aristide's crusade, the 
church hierarchy apparently feared the possible consequences of radicalizing 
the masses. 
</P>
<P>
"The upper and middle classes, of course, have heaved a sigh of relief," Midi 
said of Aristide's ouster. "They are uncomfortable when the voice of the poor 
is raised too high." 
</P>
<P>
"What they have not understood is that Aristide has contained the resentment of 
the impoverished masses by giving it a religious form," Midi added. "He has not 
sent them into the streets but drawn them into the church." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bishops Were Worried 
</P>
<P>
A Salesian spokesman in Rome, Father Joseph Aubrey, told the Voice of America 
that the expulsion was ordered because Haitian "bishops worried about the 
results of Aristide's action." 
</P>
<P>
But Father Serge Miot, secretary of Haitian Bishops Council, denied that the 
council had asked the Salesians to expel Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
The effective silencing of Aristide coincides with a move by Avril to tighten 
army discipline after a purported Oct. 14 coup attempt. Since then, the 
government has imprisoned or discharged dozens of soldiers for alleged 
insubordination. 
</P>
<P>
Leftist politicians have accused the government of clamping down on the most 
progressive element in the army -- soldiers angered by the slow progress in 
bringing about the democratic reforms Avril promised when he became president. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had Become a Symbol 
</P>
<P>
It is not known what role, if any, the government had in Aristide's ouster; but 
to some, the priest has become a symbol of the democratic struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"Aristide was discharged from his religious order in the same way that soldiers 
faithful to the Sept. 17 reform movement have been discharged from the army," 
said Paul Dejean, a Haitian author and social worker, referring to those who 
participated in the coup to gain democratic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"People who believe in the Gospel values of liberation, liberty and justice are 
penalized and punished," he said.

'DOUBLE STANDARD' RAISES EYEBROWS IN SHIAS' CAPITAL

BAALBEK, Lebanon 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scantily dressed dancers are long gone. The last liquor store was blown up 
six years ago. This ancient Roman city now is the Lebanese capital of Shia 
Muslim fundamentalism. 
</P>
<P>
Public drinking and dancing are forbidden now, but brief male-female unions 
called "pleasure marriages" are condoned. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface at least, life in Baalbek is governed by the dictates of 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's stern brand of Islamic fundamentalism in Iran, 
which to Western eyes appears joyless and forbidding. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing makeup or jewelry in public is taboo. So is singing and dancing at 
mixed gatherings because, as one woman noted, "it causes psychological 
imbalance and tempts men." 
</P>
<P>
But when the sun goes down and the doors are locked, the black robe-like 
chadors Shia women have to wear in public are discarded in favor of shorts and 
strapless tops, along with makeup and perfume. 
</P>
<P>
"People think we're made of stone just because we cover ourselves with chadors. 
But we're not. We're ready to do anything to please our husbands," said Selma, 
a housewife. 
</P>
<P>
Before Lebanon's civil war erupted in 1975, Baalbek was a cultural center where 
dance and theatrical festivals were held in the breathtaking Roman 
amphitheaters. 
</P>
<P>
Now the ruins echo with Islamic slogans as the fundamentalists stage political 
rallies there, chanting ritual denunciations of "Death to America! Death to 
Israel!" The amphitheaters have also been used as mortar positions in Lebanon's 
sectarian fighting. 
</P>
<P>
The Shias' strict life style has drawn bitter criticism from many Lebanese, 
Muslims and Christians alike who say that the fundamentalists' "double 
standards" have brought Islam into disrepute. 
</P>
<P>
Most Shias in Baalbek belong to Hezbollah (Party of God), which is believed to 
be an umbrella for Shia kidnapers holding most of the 16 foreigners missing in 
Lebanon. It's made up of zealots blindly loyal to Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
"We follow whatever Khomeini decrees. Whatever he rejects, we reject," said 
Zeinab Nasser, an administrator at the women's "haouzeh," or religious center, 
in Baalbek. 
</P>
<P>
The practice of pleasure marriage is one of the many customs frowned on by 
other Lebanese, especially moderate Shias and Sunnis. 
</P>
<P>
In a pleasure marriage, a young woman who would not dare expose a curl of her 
hair from under her chador can take on an unlimited number of lovers in the 
name of religion. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the women who take part in pleasure marriages are considered 
respectable and far from promiscuous. 
</P>
<P>
The practice is widespread in Iran, where the overwhelming majority of the 54 
million population is Shia. 
</P>
<P>
Nasser said the Prophet Mohammed sanctioned pleasure marriage, making it 
acceptable for a couple to marry for a specified period that could last "for an 
hour, two days, a month or as long as they desire." 
</P>
<P>
"It's all perfectly legal and provisions are made for any child born after the 
marriage contract expires," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
She said pleasure marriage is especially practical amid Lebanon's economic 
crisis because "men cannot afford a regular marriage, and let's face it, they 
have physical needs. 
</P>
<P>
"If these cannot be met within a permanent marriage, pleasure marriage provides 
the outlet," she added. "It's much better than doing it illicitly." 
</P>
<P>
No cleric is required to perform the ceremony. The woman, who should preferably 
be either divorced or widowed, tells the man, "I give myself to you in 
pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
He responds: "I accept." And that's it. 
</P>
<P>
Virgins need the consent of their parents, but they often do not seek it. 
</P>
<P>
As for forms of entertainment, the fundamentalists permit classical music 
"because it does not have any negative psychological effects," Nasser said. 
</P>
<P>
She observed that a scientific report proved that loud music is bad for "the 
nerves and the blood circulation." 
</P>
<P>
Like other factions in Lebanon, where the government has collapsed, the Shias 
have established their own medical and welfare systems, amply funded by Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Abbas Mousavi, a Hezbollah leader, said: "Social work has become one of our 
main responsibilities because of the catastrophes that have befallen Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"We've founded the Imam Khomeini Hospital here, which provides free medical 
treatment. There are similar centers in other Shia areas." 
</P>
<P>
He noted: "We've also founded pharmacies that make a very small profit, as well 
as schools, which we hope will accommodate 6,000 students in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
"We've given money to needy families and bought deep-bore drills to provide 
wells in remote villages, especially those we consider to have military or 
political importance." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about complaints on restrictions against alcohol and nightclubs, Mousavi 
noted: "We're not imposing Islamic values on people. No one can say we've 
raided houses where people gamble or drink." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the bombing of liquor stores and clubs, he conceded: "There were 
incidents where young men acted out of Islamic zeal after witnessing aberrant 
behavior. But Hezbollah is against that."

<TEXT>
<P>
About 150 miles from Bogota lie the mines of Muzo and Coscuez, the biggest 
emerald deposits in the world. The car drive from the Colombian capital over a 
potholed track takes eight to 10 hours. 
</P>
<P>
To Santa Barbara, a small town 5 miles from the mining centers, the land is a 
lush green. Thereafter, the terrain is a gray bleakness. The wild mountain 
peaks are covered from morning until evening in a cloak of mist as if nature 
seeks to hide its treasures. 
</P>
<P>
The houses in Santa Barbara are made of wood, despite the millions of pesos to 
be made in the town every day. There are no hotels, not even hostels for the 
simple traveler. Yet the finest and most expensive Scotch flows, and fortunes 
are squandered in the town's bars and dives. 
</P>
<P>
The neighboring town of Muzo usually has about 5,000 residents, but during an 
emerald boom -- and that happens whenever a new seam is discovered -- the 
population soars to 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warnings Issued 
</P>
<P>
For those unacquainted with the land, the journey into the mining zone can be 
extremely dangerous. Tourists are warned to stay away. The area has been dubbed 
the "Land of 1,001 Nights" and the "Devil's Caldron." 
</P>
<P>
Wild rags-to-riches stories go the rounds in Muzo and Coscuez, where 
millionaires have been made overnight. Thousands of adventurers have lost their 
lives in bloody fighting among themselves. Numerous crosses planted by the 
roadside or dotting the fields are silent testimony to the violence. 
</P>
<P>
The emerald is a form of beryl, a mineral found principally in granite and 
granite pegmatites. It is prospected in its pure form as a precious stone and 
is green or blue-green in color. 
</P>
<P>
"The most valuable are the so-called 'oil drops' and 'water eyes,' veritable 
masterpieces of nature for which vast sums are paid," explained a jeweler in 
Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
The precious stones prospected in Muzo and Coscuez are sent to Bogota to be 
valued by experts. Shine, purity and color determine the price. 
</P>
<P>
Emerald mines can also be found in Brazil, Africa, Australia, India and the 
Soviet Union. Japan even produces synthetic emeralds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Owns Resources 
</P>
<P>
The deposits in Colombia were mined in pre-Columbian times. The present 
official prospector, the Compania Esmeraldas de Colombia, holds the concession 
from the state, which owns all mineral resources in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The question of how much emerald is actually found in Colombia each year is 
difficult to answer, as great quantities of the precious stone disappear onto 
the black market. 
</P>
<P>
Official figures put the annual legal export of emeralds at $36.3 million. 
However, insiders reckon that between $100 million and $150 million worth of 
Colombian emeralds are marketed each year. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the stone depends on many factors, including ever-changing supply 
and demand, and the fluctuating rate of the dollar. Prospective purchasers are 
advised not to buy from strangers in the street, but to go to a respected 
jeweler. 
</P>
<P>
Distinguishing a fake from the real thing is not an easy task, even for the 
experts. Many a traveler has returned home with worthless glass instead of a 
valuable gem.

Margaret Swett Plummer, one of the oldest rangers in the National Park Service, 
has died of a heart attack. She was 86. 
</P>
<P>
Plummer worked at the John Muir Historical Site in Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
She was regarded by authors and scholars as an invaluable source on naturalist 
John Muir, the founder of the Sierra Club, and her grandfather, John Swett, a 
pioneering California educator. 
</P>
<P>
As a young girl, she would listen to her grandfather and Muir having passionate 
but amicable discussions.

WOMAN DIES TRYING TO GET INTO HOME VIA WINDOW 
</P>

DAYTON, Ohio

<TEXT>
<P>
A neighbor saw what he thought was a department store mannequin hanging upside 
down from the window of the house next door and ignored it. It turned out to be 
a woman who died of exposure while trying to break into her home. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Sherry Gaydos, 34, clad only in her underwear and socks, was found 
Wednesday by the neighbor, hanging upside down with her left leg wedged in a 
pantry window at her home. 
</P>
<P>
Gaydos' husband, John, was asleep inside the house when the incident occurred, 
unaware of his wife's struggle for life, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"It took two policemen to pry the window off her foot," John Gaydos said. "She 
hung upside down by her ankle and froze to death." 
</P>
<P>
Gaydos said his wife left home while he slept Tuesday evening and drove the car 
to the end of the alley, where the vehicle struck a telephone pole. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry Gaydos was taken unconscious to a Dayton hospital for treatment, then 
was released or left on her own, her husband said. In the meantime, her car -- 
with the keys inside -- was towed out of the alley, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police told Gaydos that their investigation showed that his wife took a cab 
from the hospital to their home around 1 a.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
With her keys gone, Sherry Gaydos apparently tried to force her way into a 
pantry window at the rear of the building and became trapped after the window 
closed on her foot, her husband said. 
</P>
<P>
Gaydos said his wife apparently had removed some of her clothes "because she 
was trying to be thin enough to get through the small window." 
</P>
<P>
"It was very small. No human could really have gotten into it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared Sherry Gaydos tried to boost herself through the window using a 
metal garbage can. The can was tipped over beneath the window. 
</P>
<P>
Wilma Johnson, the neighbor who discovered the woman's snow-covered body, said 
she noticed the body hanging from the window about 9 a.m. Wednesday but thought 
it was a department store mannequin. When it still was there several hours 
later, she investigated. 
</P>
<P>
Gaydos said he was at home while his wife was trying to enter the house, having 
fallen asleep on the couch. He said he awoke at about 11:30 and went to bed but 
was not aware that his wife had left. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Lett, an investigator with the Montgomery County coroner's office, said 
the official cause of death was not determined pending toxicology tests. 
</P>
<P>
"With this type of death, a woman hanging out of the window by one leg in her 
underclothing in severe weather, you question that kind of death," Lett said. 
"But at this point we did not find any foul play."

ERITREAN REBEL CAMPAIGN BACKED BY HIDDEN FACTORIES, ETHIOPIAN POWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP WILLIAMS, United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
AROTA, Ethiopia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is 11 p.m. White-coated technicians shuffle in surgical clogs from tubes to 
beakers, inspecting the quality of anti-tuberculosis pills rattling out of a 
molding machine at a rate of 40,000 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't the late shift. It is the only shift at "EPLF Pharmaceuticals," a 
lab housed inside four giant shipping crates 300 miles from the nearest 
independent electricity supply. 
</P>
<P>
Outside in a remote valley in Eritrea in northern Ethiopia, crickets and frogs 
join buzzing mosquitoes and the noise of foxes chasing African hares over the 
boulders. Civet cats and gray owls watch from stunted, moonlit trees. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, technicians of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front produce no less 
than 37 varieties of pills, capsules, ointments and liquids to be packed into 
brown bottles marked "EPLF Drug Production and Research" over a logo of a cobra 
wrapped round a pharmacist's pestle. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-year-old drug venture is just one of many backup industries supporting 
the EPLF's 27-year-old guerrilla war for independence from Ethiopia. They 
produce souped-up automobile engines, machine tools, truck bodies, molded 
shoes, textbooks, pamphlets, flour-milling machines, macaroni, spaghetti and 
even sanitary towels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety of Darkness 
</P>
<P>
Like the watch and electrical repair shops and the tank and truck garages, they 
are heavily camouflaged and operate under the safety of darkness, free of the 
threat of bombardment from Ethiopian MIG warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
All are staffed by trained personnel, many graduates, working without salary as 
their contribution to the massive, centralized war effort. 
</P>
<P>
The pharmaceutical factory is the centerpiece of the key EPLF doctrine of 
self-reliance and self-sufficiency, forced on it by years of isolation from 
external support. 
</P>
<P>
Basic chemicals are imported from Europe to make a range of the most frequently 
used preparations against diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. The EPLF 
factories produce about 40% of the basic list of 187 EPLF-approved drugs 
covering tetracycline antibiotics, sulfanilamides, vitamins, iron supplements, 
anti-parasitic, paracetamol and aspirin compounds. 
</P>
<P>
Even limited current production is reckoned to be worth more than $750,000 a 
year -- $310,000 in sterile solutions for drips and major surgery alone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Shipping Containers 
</P>
<P>
Plans are afoot to boost capacity -- with the aid of more shipping containers 
and plentiful mud -- to 80% of total drug needs. 
</P>
<P>
The laboratory and its integrated research department, run by an Eritrean 
pharmacist trained in Ethiopia and the United States, is hidden conveniently 
close to the EPLF's main hospital at Arota in northern Eritrea. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital is a huge complex, able to treat 800 to 1,000 patients in small 
units dug into rock, camouflaged and spaced for safety along 5 miles of narrow 
valley. It links a network of provincial hospitals, civilian clinics and medic 
stations concealed near the battle fronts. 
</P>
<P>
About 99% of EPLF, civilian and Ethiopian prisoner casualties can be treated 
for almost every kind of ailment and wound in this health system. 
</P>
<P>
Neighboring valleys hold mechanical and electrical shops equipped with lathes 
and specialist machinery to service and substitute even the heaviest industrial 
plant for both civilian and military needs. That includes giant generating 
units to supply basic power. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Italian Moulding Machine 
</P>
<P>
Footwear was a headache until Eritreans working abroad donated an Italian PVC 
injection molding machine eight years ago. It now cranks out 100 hot pairs of 
black plastic sandals an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The plastic base granules are imported but -- saving a penny as ever -- 20% of 
the plastic input is recycled from machine waste and old sandals collected from 
fighters in the field. Black was not a color chosen on considerations of 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"White wouldn't do for camouflage reasons," said a sandal worker. "Black is the 
most convenient in that respect." 
</P>
<P>
Italian colonists who founded an Eritrean state in the late 19th Century left 
little transport infrastructure. Most major Eritrean towns are connected by 
poor dirt roads, but these are largely off limits to Eritrean supply convoys 
because of possible land mines and the threat from Ethiopian warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
Movements of huge amounts of munitions and tons of gasoline required 
alternative networks. In physical terms, this was probably the greatest 
challenge and is the greatest concrete achievement of the Eritrean liberation 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hostile, Rocky Landscapes 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of miles of tracks capable of taking large trailer trucks have been 
driven through hostile, rocky landscapes. Most are hidden in dry, winding river 
beds, but shortcuts have been driven over 6,000-foot mountains with hairpin 
turns that would dizzy a Swiss. 
</P>
<P>
"In the early days we cut those passes with sweat, shovels and picks," said a 
veteran fighter. "These days, it's a bit different." 
</P>
<P>
The rebels now have bulldozers, grading machines and blasting powder, 
supplemented by the combined muscle of some 12,000 Ethiopian prisoners of war. 
Like the stiff-lipped Britons of the "Bridge over the River Kwai" movie, they 
appear to take a perverse pride in their contribution to the Eritrean revolt. 
</P>
<P>
Garages dot the supply routes. They have vulcanizing units, welding and brazing 
tackle, compressors and machine lathes capable of turning out replacement 
pistons and rings with critical tolerances. 
</P>
<P>
Some specialize like Western car dealers in particular models such as Toyota 
Landcruisers, olive green four-wheel-drive Moskovitches or monolithic Soviet 
trucks designed to haul outsize field guns on tires 2 feet thick. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chipped Coke Bottles 
</P>
<P>
The parsimonious efficiency of the EPLF backup operation, in which precious 
little is thrown away, defies cataloguing. Scraps of waste bread piled on 
sheets outside every field kitchen are not for the birds -- dried, they form 
the must and yeast for fermentation of a heady wheat beer served in chipped 
Coke bottles. 
</P>
<P>
In the ruined central Eritrean town of Nacfa, flattened by 10 years of almost 
daily bombing and now a gaunt symbol of the resistance, a 133-millimeter shell 
case hung on a string with a stick on a tumbledown wall is a makeshift alarm 
bell. 
</P>
<P>
Like swords turned into plowshares, finned back sections of huge unexploded 
bombs form mountings for drills and metal cutters. Rocket casings become 
charcoal grills and cooking knives. Door jambs, window frames, bunker roofing 
and furniture invariably are fashioned from wooden ammunition boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Donated burlap grain sacks are transformed into curtains and rugs, sun awnings, 
roof insulation and false ceilings. USAID sacks are particularly popular. They 
are often made from a close-woven, almost waterproof plastic and make warm 
mattresses. 
</P>
<P>
At the swarming Ethiopian POW camps, bored but grateful inmates fritter away 
hot hours around noon with playing cards cut from pasteboard ammunition 
packing. 
</P>
<P>
As the sun cools they stir and, helped enthusiastically by rebel guards as sick 
as their charges with a monotonous dry diet devoid of anything fresh or green, 
they tend cabbage, capsicum, courgette and spinach developed on EPLF 
agricultural research stations. 
</P>
<P>
The golden revolutionary rule is that nothing comes on a plate. The Eritreans 
have no alternative to self-reliance.

FROM CUCUMBERS TO CAVIAR; 
</P>
<P>
DEPARTMENT STORE EATERIES HAVE GONE TRENDY TO ATTRACT BUSY SHOPPERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When caterer David Zafferelli joined the throngs at Nordstrom's new downtown 
San Francisco store in October, he dropped $150 on two flannel shirts and 
another $150 for bubbly and Beluga caviar at the store's Champagne Exchange 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
"We just thought that was as much fun as shopping," he said. "I'll always go 
for any excuse to drink champagne and eat caviar." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, shoppers who stop to nosh at department stores are finding chic, 
newfangled eateries in place of the proper tearooms and restaurants of their 
childhoods. Whereas patrons in the early part of the century sipped tea and 
nibbled cucumber sandwiches, customers of upscale department stores today are 
more likely to have espresso and cookies or Cornish game hen and Chardonnay or 
mesquite-grilled chicken and pasta salad. 
</P>
<P>
The shifts in department store food service reflect a fundamental change in the 
philosophy of shoppers, observers say. In the old days, people would make 
shopping an all-day event, with a leisurely lunch or tea break built in. Today, 
with time-starved but hard-working baby boomers hankering for service and 
quality, the right restaurant can serve not only as a lure but also as an 
incentive to linger in the store. And shoppers such as Zafferelli have proved 
willing to spend liberally for the ambiance. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, old-fashioned tearooms still exist, and some, such as those at 
Bullocks Wilshire and Bullock's Pasadena, are thriving, particularly at holiday 
time. But many stores in recent years have turned these genteel anachronisms 
into stylish cafes or bistros where customers come year-round just to dine, 
never mind the shopping. 
</P>
<P>
"The '80s has brought us into a whole different era," said Robert J. Nyman, 
president of George Lang Corp., a New York firm that develops restaurant 
concepts. "Most stores today are using food service as an amenity that has to 
do with the total marketing of the store." 
</P>
<P>
With department stores undergoing sweeping changes of late, many retailers, 
particularly downtown merchants that must compete with ubiquitous suburban 
malls, have strived to hold onto or devise unique operations that make them a 
destination. Restaurants often fill the bill, even if they don't contribute 
heartily to the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
At the new Nordstrom in San Francisco, for example, the marble-topped champagne 
bar has become a draw for upscale customers, as has an authentic English pub 
modeled on one at Harrods in London. At the flagship Bloomingdale's in 
Manhattan, the premier dining spot among half a dozen eateries is Le Train 
Bleu, a re-creation of a luxury Orient Express-type dining car. The Dayton 
Hudson department stores in the Midwest are expanding a Marketplace Foods 
concept that offers carry-out pasta, stir-fried dishes, freshly baked breads 
and frozen yogurt to busy downtown workers. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike their tearoom predecessors, which usually were situated in a store's 
highest reaches, these food outlets are often stashed next to fashion 
departments. And they are a far cry from the Formica-topped counters prevalent 
at five-and-dime and discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
"The opportunities for food in department stores are the best they've been in 
over 20 years," said John D. Lovelace, central director of food services for 
Dayton Hudson in Minneapolis. "People eat every day, but they don't shop every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
Food service has gone in and out of favor with retailers over the last few 
decades, and even today retailers' philosophies differ widely. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very mixed bag," said Charles J. Leven, senior vice president, 
director of operations at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York. "Some companies are 
cutting back, a few are expanding." Saks intends to open its first restaurant 
at the flagship Manhattan store next year, Leven said, after customers clamored 
for food service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Quick Food' Concepts 
</P>
<P>
Until about 1950, large department stores catering to the carriage trade 
typically used a chunk of their space for tearooms. In the 1960s, the 
popularity of such rooms declined, and many started losing money. As real 
estate became more valuable in the 1970s, merchants began devoting the space to 
clothing and other items that were more profitable. At the same time, many 
stores were going into suburban malls that had abundant sit-down restaurants or 
fast-food outlets in so-called food courts. 
</P>
<P>
Then women went to work in record numbers and the population became more health 
and diet conscious. Fewer people had the time or inclination to spend a 
leisurely afternoon at their favorite tearoom. That gave rise to a variety of 
"quick food" concepts in stores catering to customers for whom money was less 
of an object than convenience and quality. 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom plunged into the food business 10 years ago after having leased space 
for years to a small chain of restaurants. It now has 70 food outlets in 58 
stores, most under the names Espresso Bar and Cafe Express, featuring fresh 
soups and salads. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with having to attract shoppers to a seedy location three blocks from 
Union Square in San Francisco, Nordstrom decided to go in for some culinary 
theatrics in its newest store. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to create little pockets of fun," said Jim Dickinson, general 
manager of the Seattle-based chain's restaurant division. "We also wanted to 
create a reason for people to stay in our stores rather than get out to our 
competitors." 
</P>
<P>
The Pub, strategically placed next to the men's department, is modeled on the 
Green Man at Harrods in London, an innovative retailer that houses about 20 
food outlets and a massive food hall where Londoners and tourists alike buy 
pricey groceries. The Nordstrom room features stools covered with forest green 
leather, a plank floor made of Kentucky barn wood, a healthy selection of 
imported and domestic beers and television monitors. 
</P>
<P>
If the Pub idea proves successful, Dickinson said, Nordstrom plans to expand it 
into other new stores nationwide. The chain also is considering a "bread basket 
concept" that would sell freshly baked goods and small open-face sandwiches, 
already dubbed Nordwiches. 
</P>
<P>
The store's Champagne Exchange was designed to offer a high return. It takes up 
less space by far than would a traditional tearoom yet affords a high markup on 
its caviar and 103 champagne varieties. The concept "enables the customer to 
spend a lot of money," Dickinson said. "We do find, particularly in San 
Francisco, it doesn't bother people to be drinking a $9 glass of champagne." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lots of Flash 
</P>
<P>
The chain also this holiday rolled out its Nordstrom Select Pantry, a selection 
of gift food items developed in its restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Dickinson said, Nordstrom's restaurant operations account for 1.5% of 
the chain's annual sales (which last year totaled nearly $2 billion) yet 22% of 
its transactions, indicating that food tabs are generally far lower than those 
for other purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Bloomingdale's flagship store in New York also goes in for selling sizzle along 
with its steaks. "The restaurants at Bloomingdale's have evolved into unique 
concepts in tune with the eating public," said Will Hellemeyer, director of 
food service. "We are what people expect of restaurants in the '80s . . . and 
not what they expect to find in a department store restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
After renovating the housewares department several years ago, the store was 
left with a long, narrow space on an intermediate level between two floors. A 
store designer came up with the idea of copying a luxury dining car, complete 
with green velvet chairs, white linen tablecloths and brass chandeliers. 
</P>
<P>
Le Train Bleu (named for a midnight blue engine), which opened in 1978, is "a 
Continental restaurant that competes with restaurants on the East Side of 
Manhattan and is rated in dining guides," Hellemeyer said. With seating for 64, 
the restaurant features such specialties as calf's liver with cassis and 
shallots, grilled Cornish game hen stuffed with foie gras and wild rice and 
grilled swordfish with sun-dried tomato butter. Average tab: $20. 
</P>
<P>
Among other Bloomie's food service operations, Hellemeyer said, are Forty 
Carrots, a "healthy food" restaurant in which the store years ago introduced 
frozen yogurt to the New York market; Showtime Cafe, an upscale cafeteria 
similar to Cafe Casino, and Espresso Bar, "a Euro-chic Italian cafe" offering 
desserts, fresh pastas, salads and wines. 
</P>
<P>
The decision whether to offer food service is usually based on a store's 
location and bottom line. Store officials would not talk about their 
restaurants' financial results, but they acknowledged that food service is an 
expensive proposition. 
</P>
<P>
The food business "in general has lower margins than most other merchandise in 
a department store," said Ken Stevens, a consultant with the Los Angeles office 
of McKinsey &amp; Co. It comes down to a trade-off, with the retailer 
determining whether the intangible benefits of offering the service outweigh 
the reduced profitability. 
</P>
<P>
At Marshall Field's in Chicago, for instance, the legendary Walnut Room -- a 
restaurant in the old tradition -- is not considered a big profit maker "other 
than that it's a big draw," said Homer G. Sharp, head of central display. 
"Obviously, people go shopping while they're here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some End Food Service 
</P>
<P>
With a typical sit-down eatery costing between $500,000 and $1 million to 
install, many retailers, May Co. California among them, are inclined to put 
restaurants into free-standing stores but not into those mall locations served 
by a food court. Another consideration is space: New department stores tend to 
be far smaller than the huge stores of years past and have less space to spare 
for low-return businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Bonwit Teller, a fashion specialty store, has phased out its food business. 
Until its purchase by May Department Stores two years ago, Robinson's was 
making a big push into food service. Now, it has only three food outlets 
chain-wide, all of them leased. 
</P>
<P>
In designing its newest stores, including those in Los Angeles and Palm Desert, 
Bullock's left out restaurants. And when the chain remodeled its Santa Ana 
location, the restaurant was removed. 
</P>
<P>
The tearoom in Bullock's Pasadena, according to James B. Brooks, the store's 
general manager, is the chain's most profitable food service operation and 
lately has been expanding its successful banquet business. Even so, the tearoom 
recently eliminated its evening food service, primarily because of increased 
restaurant competition in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest proponents of food is Dayton Hudson Department Store Co., 
which claims to have the largest upscale food service among U.S. department 
stores, serving 12 million patrons a year. 
</P>

When Lovelace, the food service director, joined the company in 1982, he 
immediately set about developing new "upscale fast-food" concepts and 
transforming the company's traditional sit-down restaurants "to meet the needs 
of the customer of the '80s." 
</P>
<P>
Among other operations, the company came up with Yogurt Express, which 
generates a hefty $1,000 in sales per square foot (compared to about $200 for 
non-food merchandise) and is being rolled out to several of the company's 37 
stores; 700 Express, designed to serve customers quality fast food within 10 
minutes, and a combination of five quick food concepts that replaced the 
flagship Minneapolis store's traditional Sky Room and quickly tripled sales. 
The company is also expanding its 4-year-old Marketplace Foods, similar to 
Macy's Cellar in New York, with a substantial carry-out area. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting customers' rapidly changing palates, ethnic foods are playing a 
bigger role in Dayton Hudson's offerings. Forget the cling peach halves, 
cottage cheese and iceberg lettuce leaves of yore. New menus offer Morocco 
salad, made with boneless chicken breast and couscous ($6), and smoked salmon 
with radicchio, bibb lettuce, avocado, grapefruit, chopped egg and caviar, 
Dayton Hudson's most expensive salad at $7. 
</P>
<P>
The Broadway, too, has found that its customers' changing tastes have forced it 
to adapt quickly to new trends. It recently closed a traditional sit-down 
restaurant at its Brea Mall store in favor of a deli service with lighter fare. 
"We . . . have seen a really remarkable response," said Richard F. Clayton, 
president. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Food Is Fashion' 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Bullock's, the Broadway has put food service operations into its newest 
stores, but it also recently closed restaurants in Beverly Center and Baldwin 
Hills where it "couldn't come up with a formula that worked," Clayton said. The 
43-store chain now operates 24 food facilities, serving more than 2 million 
diners a year. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a lot of transactions," Clayton said. "It's important because we touch 
a lot of customers." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, food service, once the province of large department stores, has also 
spread to smaller specialty apparel boutiques such as Koala Blue, with its 
Australian-style milk bars; Fred Segal, which has restaurants at stores in 
Santa Monica and on Melrose Avenue; Merry Go Round, a chain selling young men's 
and women's apparel that is testing a '50s-style diner and soda fountain in a 
store in Denver, and Barneys, an exclusive women's clothier in Manhattan that 
has Le Cafe, a buffet and bistro bar with about 90 seats. 
</P>
<P>
To Dickinson of Nordstrom, the merging of menus and merchandise makes sense. 
"We consider ourselves a fashion retail store, and we believe food is fashion," 
he said. "There is tremendous opportunity for good dining."

Oil from a ruptured Shell Oil Co. pipeline floated down the Mississippi River 
and forced cleanup crews to work round the clock to try to limit effects of the 
spill, a Shell spokesman in St. Louis said. Missouri Department of Natural 
Resources officials said the spill -- the worst in the state's history -- began 
Dec. 24 when a pipeline at Vienna, Mo., ruptured, allowing at least 336,000 
gallons of dichlorobenzene, a petroleum product, to flow into the Gasconade 
River. The spill has not caused problems with water supplies, but state 
officials said they could not measure the long-term effects on fish and 
wildlife in the Gasconade, Missouri and Mississippi rivers. Shell spokesman 
Tony Canino said that the cold weather prevented the oil from clinging to the 
river banks.

The American Legion's top recruiter in California turned in more than 200 phony 
membership registrations, including ones for a former German soldier and people 
who were dead, according to a Legion report. Costa Mesa Post Cmdr. Robert 
Hanson could be expelled from the American Legion, said state Cmdr. Andrew J. 
Steffanic. A three-member Legion committee issued its findings in a 13-page 
report signed by Steffanic. Hanson, 67, declined to discuss the report, but 
said, "I am contemplating legal action." The state American Legion awarded 
Hanson its Recruiter of the Year award after Hanson submitted 801 new 
memberships between July 1, 1987, and the 1988 convention. But the 
investigation found that only 18 of the supposed applicants paid dues by check, 
while Hanson wrote about 25 checks to the Costa Mesa post for $8,249.60 from 
his own account. The investigation began after national headquarters received 
inquiries from people wondering why they were receiving the American Legion 
Magazine. Hanson told state Legion officials that the 801 membership 
applications were stolen Aug. 26 when someone broke into his car.

A missing teen-ager who authorities had stopped looking for over the protest of 
his parents was in fair condition after he was found wandering and disoriented 
in the Cleveland National Forest. Andrew Campbell, 15, of rural Guatay had been 
missing six days when he was found Friday in an oak grove by a father and son 
who had gone for a drive in the San Diego County backcountry. Campbell was 
suffering from minor frostbite.

Anti-terrorist police in London arrested several people in connection with the 
discovery two weeks ago of a major IRA bomb factory in the city. Police would 
not say how many people were rounded up or give further details of the 
operation. One man was arrested earlier after police found an apartment in 
south London full of bomb-making equipment and more than 100 pounds of Semtex 
explosives of the sort used by Irish Republican Army guerrillas fighting to end 
British rule in Northern Ireland. He was charged with conspiracy to cause 
explosions in Britain likely to endanger life.

A runaway commuter train barreled through the Bavarian countryside for 12 1/2 
miles after the engineer left it unattended to go to the bathroom, but forgot 
to set the brake, officials said. The train, which had no passengers at the 
time, finally was intentionally derailed. No one was hurt as the train traveled 
from Ebersberg to Wasserburg in upper Bavaria, roaring through 20 regular 
passenger stops during its 20-minute run, averaging 37 m.p.h., police added. 
The train was at the end of its usual commuter run.

Two men hired to monitor the performance of lottery ticket computers sued the 
California Lottery, complaining that officials ignored reports that computer 
problems were underreported. In the Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit, Emmitt 
A. Allison and Randy Troxel alleged that they were placed on administrative 
leave and reassigned in September after they took their complaints to the state 
controller's office. State lottery officials have said the allegations were 
investigated and were unfounded. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and a 
court order forbidding lottery officials from destroying documents supporting 
Allison's and Troxel's findings.

HOMELESS FAMILIES LEAVE SQUALID HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scrambling to meet its New Year's Eve deadline, New York City moved the last of 
448 homeless families from Manhattan's squalid Martinique Hotel. Located near 
Macy's department store, the turn-of-the-century hotel at Broadway and 32nd 
Street had become a national symbol of the problems faced by those too poor to 
afford housing. Faced with the threat of a federal funds cutoff and political 
pressure, Mayor Edward I. Koch's Administration pledged to close one of its 42 
welfare hotels by year's end. Koch has pledged to empty all the welfare hotels 
by July, 1990. The Martinique, where the city paid $1,800 per family, was 
closed first because it was "emblematic" of the conditions in other welfare 
hotels, said John Beckman, a city Human Resources Administration spokesman. 
Some of the relocated families were taken to newly rehabilitated apartments. 
Others were transfered to other city-run facilities for the homeless. The 
Martinique became a welfare hotel 15 years ago and at its height housed about 
500 adults and 1,500 children. It once featured a fashionable dancehall and 
popular nightclub.

More than 500 Tibetan university students defied a ban on demonstations in 
Lhasa and marched to the regional government headquarters calling for a 
"peaceful solution to the Tibetan problem." Tibetan and foreign sources said 
that the demonstrators from Lhasa University encountered no resistance from the 
massive Chinese police force in the capital and that there was no violence. The 
demonstration was in sharp contrast with an anti-Chinese, pro-independence 
rally Dec. 10 in which police fired on unarmed Tibetan Buddhist monks and 
onlookers, killing as many as eight people.

IN SEARCH OF AN IDENTITY;

<P>
AREA LACKS A SENSE OF COMMUNITY

Dick Haddon's church has an identity problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell people that the First United Methodist Church of Gardena is not in 
Gardena," the Rev. Haddon said, "and people just kind of stare in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Gardena, but it's not. Even the post office says 'Gardena,' but the 
reality is, we do not live in Gardena. . . . If we had a fire . . . the 
response would come from the city of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
That is a complicated fact of life in Harbor Gateway, the 8-mile long, 
4-block-wide umbilical cord acquired at the turn of the century to link Los 
Angeles to its port. 
</P>
<P>
In a city where community names conjure up images -- Venice, Silver Lake, Boyle 
Heights -- Harbor Gateway draws a blank. 
</P>
<P>
Bounded on the west by Gardena and Torrance and on the east by Carson and 
unincorporated county land, the area was for decades known as the "city strip," 
the "shoestring strip" or, simply, "the strip." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Area Rechristened 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, the Los Angeles City Council rechristened the area to try to 
bring a sense of identity and community pride to its citizens -- some of whom 
do not even know they live in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Gateway lacks much of what makes a community a community -- no central 
business district, no civic center or gathering place, no library branch, no 
police station and, as Haddon noted, no post office. Its largest park is a 
cemetery. And, despite the new name, mailing addresses of residents remain 
unchanged. They still say Torrance or Gardena, not Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, this leaves some people confused. 
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'Look, my mailing address is Gardena,' " reported Gene Painter, the 
city of Gardena's superintendent of human services who said he does not turn 
away Harbor Gateway residents who ask for help. "Strange as it may seem, they 
don't know where they live." 
</P>
<P>
Optician Chris Toughill joined the Torrance Chamber of Commerce when he opened 
his shop in a Harbor Gateway strip mall, and his neighbors did the same. It 
wasn't until the Torrance mayor declined to attend their grand opening, 
Toughill said, that the merchants discovered that they were in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Even the young toughs of the Gardena 13 gang, interviewed while hanging out on 
a Harbor Gateway street corner, insisted they were standing in Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
In population, Harbor Gateway is tied with Westwood as Los Angeles' 
second-fastest growing area. Sylmar is first. Between 1980 and 1986, according 
to Los Angeles Planning Department estimates, Harbor Gateway's population 
increased 15.6%, from 30,238 to 34,951. 
</P>
<P>
A drive through the Gateway is like a trip from the city to the suburbs. On the 
north end, which begins at El Segundo Boulevard, there are apartments needing 
repair, gang graffiti on walls and single-family homes with barred windows. The 
southern end -- which stops at Sepulveda Boulevard, where Harbor City begins -- 
is punctuated by newly built strip malls, condominiums and well-manicured 
lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Property values follow a similar pattern, with the lowest prices in the north. 
Home values in nearby Torrance or Gardena, however, are considerably higher. 
Real estate agents report that a house in Harbor Gateway might sell for as much 
as $50,000 less than one across the street in another community. 
</P>
<P>
Agents attribute the difference to better city services, particularly in 
Torrance, which has its own schools. 
</P>
<P>
"The minute you mention Los Angeles," said Gardena real estate agent John 
Warner, "it frightens . . . people away. It's just one of those things. Homes 
have always been cheaper over there (Harbor Gateway)." 
</P>
<P>
Said resident Betty Roy: "I hate to be known to live in the strip. When my 
friends ask where I live, I tell them Torrance." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, four years after the name change -- in spite of spiffy blue-and-white 
signs that declare "Harbor Gateway" below the Los Angeles city seal -- those 
who live and work there say they still feel betwixt and between, not fully a 
part of Los Angeles, Harbor Gateway or the bordering cities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'In Limbo' 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they complain that their new moniker has not brought with it what 
they really want: more attention from city officials, better services such as 
street cleaning and tree trimming and, above all, increased police protection. 
</P>
<P>
"We're like in limbo," said Roy, a longtime resident of the Gateway's southern 
end. "We're not really Torrance and we're not really Carson. . . . We're only 
here because Los Angeles needs this little piece of land to attach to the 
harbor. Nobody cares about us. . . . We're like the forgotten people." 
</P>
<P>
For Sylvia Figueroa, life on the border means a daily struggle at It's a 
Miracle, the Mexican pizza parlor she opened a year ago at Gardena Boulevard 
and Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Gardena is across the street, and the differences are stark. On the 
Gardena side, Gardena Boulevard -- that city's main business thoroughfare -- is 
getting a face lift. The street is clean, and the trees are neatly trimmed. 
City officials are offering grants to business owners for renovations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood Contrasts 
</P>
<P>
Across the street in Los Angeles, the trees are scraggly and overgrown, 
vagrants sleep in a littered vacant lot, liquor stores abound and the Gardena 
13 gang seems to own the corner. 
</P>
<P>
"The other side there's no drunk people, no people looking for drugs," said 
Figueroa, who sweeps her sidewalk regularly. "The other side is so clean. Even 
the sidewalk is clean. 
</P>
<P>
"You see the street?" she asked, pointing to a pile of litter. "That's 
terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who represents the area, 
conceded that the Gateway is not getting its share of services. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to get a library in there, because no matter where you put a 
library in the Gateway, you only serve a limited number of city residents," she 
said. "It's difficult to get a street cleaning service on a regular basis 
because they have to come from somewhere else to get there. . . . It's not like 
having a nice, round community where you have something in the middle and it 
serves everybody around it." 
</P>
<P>
The United Way apparently agrees. In March, the umbrella agency's 
Harbor/Southeast division declared Harbor Gateway an "under-served geographic 
area," citing "real gaps in law enforcement" and social services. 
</P>
<P>
The declaration is part of a long-term plan by the United Way to upgrade Harbor 
Gateway by organizing neighborhood leaders to form nonprofit programs for 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
A citizens group, chaired by Haddon, is setting goals for the project, 
apparently marking the first time that community leaders around the Gateway 
have come together to talk about the area's problems. The minister and some 
others agree that the first goal should be improving community pride and 
cohesiveness to create political clout. 
</P>
<P>
To do that, residents must reverse 82 years of history. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, since the so-called Shoestring Strip Annexation of Dec. 26, 
1906, Harbor Gateway residents have somehow coalesced into five distinct 
neighborhoods. From north to south, their rough boundaries are El Segundo 
Boulevard to Rosecrans Avenue; Rosecrans to Redondo Beach Boulevard; Redondo 
Beach to Artesia Boulevard; Artesia to 190th Street; and 190th Street to 
Sepulveda Boulevard. The east-west boundaries of the three northern 
neighborhoods are Vermont Avenue and Figueroa Street, while Western and 
Normandie avenues bound the two in the south. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Harbor Gateway is a racially mixed, middle-income area, with an 
estimated median household income of $30,431 and a population that is 48.4% 
white, 13.2% black, 16.5% Asian and 21.8% other racial groups, according to the 
1980 census, the most recent statistics available. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos -- whose numbers are not tallied as part of the racial breakdown in the 
1980 census -- are Harbor Gateway's largest minority group, accounting for 
32.9% of the overall population, according to census data. 
</P>
<P>
However, the picture changes when the area is more closely examined. 
Demographic statistics show that the various Gateway neighborhoods often 
resemble adjacent communities more closely than they do one another. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the two Gateway neighborhoods near south South-Central Los Angeles 
and Compton have the heaviest concentration of blacks, 44.7%. Whites make up 
23.6% of those two neighborhoods, which extend north from Redondo Beach 
Boulevard, and Asians make up 6.9%. The estimated median household income there 
is $27,453. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Make-Up of Community 
</P>
<P>
But in the strip's midsection, from Artesia Boulevard to 190th Street, the 
population reflects that of the southern end of Gardena, which is heavily 
Asian. There, the black population is minuscule -- just 0.4% -- with most of 
the population split between whites, 48.1%, and Asians, 44.8%. Estimated 
household income in this section jumps dramatically, to $44,498. 
</P>
<P>
And south of 190th Street, approaching predominantly white Torrance, the white 
population jumps even higher, to 66.3%, while the Asian population dips to 8.6% 
and the number of blacks rises slightly, to 2%. Median household income is 
$27,607. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is primarily residential, the Gateway also includes a burgeoning 
business district at the San Diego and Harbor freeways, where, according to the 
California Department of Transportation, 500,000 cars drive by each day, making 
it the second-busiest intersection in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called 190th Street Corridor is a major drawing card for commercial 
developers, who have built about 5 million square feet of office space there in 
the last eight years. Gleaming high-rises with pleasant landscaping have 
replaced a Shell oil refinery and manufacturing plants. 
</P>
<P>
"We sort of had a shift from the Industrial Age to the Information Age," said 
Howard Mann, president of Andrex Development Co., one of the area's major 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
Mann predicts that the move away from industrial to commercial uses will help 
upgrade nearby areas by attracting home buyers who hold high-paying jobs in 
what he calls Harbor Gateway's "urban cluster." Already, he is planning a 
restaurant to meet that market, based on an analysis that, he said, "found that 
the average income per household within a 5-mile radius of this intersection is 
$50,000." 
</P>
<P>
Dining in elegance, however, is certainly not a priority farther north in 
Harbor Gateway, where large concentrations of undocumented Latinos residents 
are struggling to get by. 
</P>
<P>
A study by the United Way found that illegal Latino immigrants are the "most 
under-served" group in the Gateway. 
</P>
<P>
Haddon and other local leaders said their presence also makes it difficult to 
form neighborhood coalitions because illegal aliens fear they will attract 
unwanted attention from immigration authorities if they participate in 
community affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Their need is to be invisible," the minister said, "and that does not make for 
a good community." 
</P>
<P>
Haddon is particularly attuned to the problems of undocumented residents 
because his church runs the 3-year-old Harbor Gateway Center, one of only two 
social service agencies the United Way found serving the strip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Center's Problems 
</P>
<P>
The center -- which offers a variety of nutritional, health and educational 
programs to about 1,500 people -- lacks money and staff. The executive director 
left more than a year ago when the money to pay her ran out. Haddon, who took 
the pastor's job in July, has been doing her job ever since. 
</P>
<P>
United Way officials say they would like to strengthen the center and also 
persuade social service agencies in neighboring communities to expand 
operations here. Their study showed that the area lacks adequate shelters for 
battered women, delinquency prevention programs, drug- and alcohol-abuse 
programs and crisis intervention centers. 
</P>
<P>
If there is one common thread in the complaints from Gateway residents, it is 
the increasing gang activity and the lack of police protection. Many said that 
they go for days without seeing a patrol car and that officers covering the 
area are often sent on calls elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police officials said they have been trying to improve service, 
especially during the past year when citizens groups and Flores have pressed 
for additional patrols. But they also acknowledged that cars are called out of 
the area more often than they would like. Capt. Sandy Wasson of the Los Angeles 
Police Department's Southeast Division, which covers the part of the strip 
north of the San Diego Freeway, took issue with residents who say Harbor 
Gateway gets less than its fair share of coverage. He said a recent deployment 
study showed that while the area has fewer patrol cars -- just one basic car in 
the north and one in the south -- it also has less crime. 
</P>
<P>
Wasson said he views Harbor Gateway as "a neighborhood in transition that's got 
great potential." He has encouraged the formation of neighborhood watch groups. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, for one, said she senses a growing participation in such groups and "a 
renewed interest in community improvement." 
</P>
<P>
She maintained that the city has improved services in recent years, especially 
police coverage. She also noted that a Harbor Gateway paramedic unit was 
established in June and that this year, the city Library Department finally 
included a proposal for a Harbor Gateway branch in its long-term plan. 
</P>
<P>
The councilwoman said she would like the Gateway to have its own post office 
and ZIP code. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important," she said, "to have an actual tag and title on who you 
are and where you are." 
</P>
<P>
But she said she knows persuading the federal government will be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Flores said, she is thankful for whatever recognition the new 
name has brought the area. 
</P>
<P>
"At least," she said, "I know that when I mention Harbor Gateway in City 
Council now, my colleagues know what I'm talking about."

LAWMEN STRIVE TO GET DRUNK DRIVERS OFF ROADS 
</P>

<P>
New Year's Eve party-goers who drink and drive faced a greater chance of 
beginning 1989 in jail as law enforcement officers fanned out in unusually 
heavy numbers Saturday to rid Southern California roadways of drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol, which reported one freeway traffic death blamed 
on a drunk driver late Friday, canceled days off for many officers so they 
could staff an "Operation Impaired Driver" task force in the downtown area New 
Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-officer unit, double the usual deployment against drunk drivers, 
concentrated on the heavily traveled freeways -- the Santa Monica, Harbor, 
Pasadena, Golden State and Hollywood -- that converge in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll be out there just to look for drunken drivers, to stop them and arrest 
them," CHP Officer Diane Lowery said. "It means that there will also be more 
officers to assist any motorists needing help." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roadblock in Burbank 
</P>
<P>
The CHP scheduled no New Year's Eve sobriety checkpoints, but at least one 
local law enforcement agency, the Burbank Police Department, planned a 
roadblock to snare drunk drivers beginning about one hour before dark at an 
undisclosed location, Police Lt. Don Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers stopped 800 drivers at a sobriety checkpoint Friday night in 
Baldwin Park, arresting five on suspicion of driving under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Los Angeles set up a van that houses their Immediate Booking and 
Release System behind Parker Center police headquarters, where it was to be in 
operation from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m. New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic officers throughout the city planned "maximum deployment," utilizing 
all available officers and assigning them specially to look for motorists under 
the influence of alcohol or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agencies Beef Up Patrols 
</P>
<P>
Several law agencies in Orange County also planned beefed-up patrols. In Costa 
Mesa, seven two-officer teams will look for drunk drivers, then put them behind 
bars with the help of specially assigned jail personnel, Police Sgt. Tom Winter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP reported one alcohol-related traffic death about 11 p.m. Friday, six 
hours into the agency's holiday fatality reporting period that ends midnight 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Rene Rodriquez, 21, was booked on suspicion of felony drunk driving and 
vehicular manslaughter after the fiery crash on the Harbor Freeway near El 
Segundo Boulevard in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Rodriquez drove his Datsun 280Z onto the freeway at about 
100 m.p.h. When he swerved to avoid other traffic, the car struck the center 
divider and flipped on its side, skidding along the cement divider for 250 
yards as it burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Passenger Dies 
</P>
<P>
A passenger, Raul Trevino, 28, of Lawndale, was trapped inside the car and 
killed. Rodriquez escaped with minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP recorded four traffic deaths during the New Year's holiday period last 
year in Los Angeles County. Statewide, 43 people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers arrested 467 people for suspected drunk driving in Los Angeles 
County last year and made 1,874 arrests statewide.

2 MEN SLAIN AS 1988 SHOOTINGS SET A RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two young men were killed and four people wounded as drive-by gunmen and street 
gangs marked the beginning of the long holiday weekend with a series of 
shootings, ending 1988 with record mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend's first fatal shooting occurred at 9 p.m. Friday in South Los 
Angeles, where Raymond Smith, 21, was shot and killed, apparently by occupants 
of a passing car, as he stood in the 200 block of West 84th Street, Lt. Bob 
Hansohn said. Nearby, 20 minutes later, Adam Lopez, 16, was shot to death from 
a passing car as he walked out of a liquor store at 54th and Hoover streets. 
</P>
<P>
The two shootings were not believed to be related. Hansohn, of the 77th Street 
Division, said no suspects had been taken into custody but the shootings "would 
probably turn out to be" gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
Three other shootings, all in an area west of downtown, were apparently 
retaliatory attacks involving two rival gangs, Sgt. Ray Heslop of the Rampart 
Division said Saturday. Those shootings left four people wounded, two of them 
critically. 
</P>
<P>
Heslop said Edward Moran, 21, of Tujunga, was driving past a group of men 
gathered on a front porch on Witmer Street between 3rd and 6th streets at 11:30 
p.m. Friday, when they yelled out gang slogans and fired three shots, Heslop 
said. Moran was hit once in the leg. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, Ramon Gomez, 24, was standing at the corner of Temple Street and 
Edgeware Road at 1 a.m. Saturday when two men drove past in a car and fired 
three shots from a small caliber revolver, Heslop said. He was wounded in the 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
Heslop said the shooting "was apparently" by the same gang members who had 
fired at Moran from the sidewalk and who had gotten into a car to continue the 
gunplay. 
</P>
<P>
A third shooting, possibly related to the first two, occurred at 2:30 a.m. near 
Crown Hill Street and Loma Drive when several shots were fired from an unknown 
source into a group of young men and women, critically wounding a man in the 
arm and back, and a woman in the chest and back, Heslop said. 
</P>
<P>
Both victims were taken to the County-USC Medical Center. Their names were not 
released. 
</P>
<P>
The killings in the 77th Street Division were not included in either the 
Sheriff's or Police Department's preliminary statistics, which indicated 1988 
would end with record totals of gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department reported 207 gang killings in the first 10 months of the 
year, a 24.7% jump over the 166 in the same period of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department, which patrols unincorporated areas of Los Angeles 
County and contracts its services to smaller cities, reported 94 gang killings 
in 1988, an 18.1% increase over 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Although police statistics were available only through October, the sheriff's 
report, issued Friday, backed up statements by Sheriff Sherman Block that gang 
violence was on a dramatic rise.

THE YEAR THE AMERICAN MOVIE CAME BACK; 
</P>
<P>
'ACCIDENTAL TOURIST' TOPS THE TIMES' CRITIC'S 10 BEST OF 1988 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON

<TEXT>
<P>
There are years when a look back over the year's most significant films for 
that arbitrary ten comes with what one writer once called that nasty ratcheting 
sound made by scraping the bottom of the barrel. Then there are years when each 
move to pare down to only 10 brings hours of remorse and deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
And oddly enough, this was one of those killer years. As it warmed up, 1988 may 
not have seemed fated to be an extra superbly choicest year, if you could grade 
movies the way they grade tea. But it gained momentum after a slow first half 
until finally the year could be chalked up as fat, full and innovative. 
</P>
<P>
You cannot fault innovation, not in the same calendar year that marked "Who 
Framed Roger Rabbit" and "Little Dorrit," but full is certainly a big part of 
that equation. Between new screens cropping up like mushrooms after a rain and 
the insatiable maw of video, which insists that movies at least curtsy on a big 
screen before being gulped down into the small one, we are seeing roughly 60 
more films now than we did in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
When you are staring, dumbfounded, at the marshamallowed dimensions of a film 
like "Zelly and Me" it can seem a particularly high psychic price to pay, 
simply to fill more theater screens. Particularly when some of the theaters are 
roughly the size of an airline washroom, and flood with light whenever 
late-comers shuffle into to one of their 45 seats. 
</P>
<P>
Then a film like "The Chocolate War" gets its crack at one of those screens, 
giving audiences a chance to discover the strengths of its astonishingly 
assured young debuting director, Keith Gordon, and it all seems worth it again. 
</P>
<P>
1988 may be remembered as the point at which the quintessentially American 
movie came back into its own, giving us the outright delights of "Punchline," 
"Bull Durham," "Big," "8 Men Out," "Roger Rabbit," "Dominick and Eugene," 
"Tucker" or " Working Girl." 
</P>
<P>
It was also the year for films adapted from exceptionally knotty books, and 
succeed or fail, the determination involved in "The Unbearable Lightness of 
Being," "The Accidental Tourist," "Little Dorrit," "The Milagro Beanfield War," 
"Pelle the Conqueror" and "The Last Temptation of Christ" had to be admired. 
</P>
<P>
Art, music and even food had their day on the screen with "The Moderns," 
"Vincent," "Bird" "Long Live the Lady" and "Babette's Feast." By and large, 
films with urgent social or political issues still came with passports or not 
at all: "A World Apart," "Hotel Terminus: the Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," 
"A Cry in the Dark," "Salaam Bombay!" In some cases it was a foreign-born 
director who took on American social issues, the case of "Betrayed" and 
"Mississippi Burning." 
</P>
<P>
The 10 films that impressed me most this year are below, ranked in order, with 
special notice that "Punchline" very nearly threw the whole matter into a tie. 
So, the runner up-list is a hair's breath one this year. 
</P>
<P>
1. "It's not just how much you love someone," William Hurt as a grieving father 
muses in "The Accidental Tourist," "it's who you are when you're with them." 
Director-co-writer Lawrence Kasdan has made watching this man come alive, 
perhaps for the first time, into a small-scale epiphany. What's startling is 
how this story, which takes place during Hurt's second year of mourning, can be 
as funny as it is. However, like Anne Tyler's singular book, the humor comes 
from character and the family Hurt springs from is memorable enough to have 
escaped from Dickens. Among the excellent ensemble, all of whom seem to have a 
decidedly droll bent and a knack for underplaying, you can find the 
irresistible Geena Davis. She plays a dog obedience trainer to whom Hurt's 
Welsh corgi, Edward, takes an enormous shine. It's entirely understandable. 
</P>
<P>
2. "Little Dorrit's" virtues are not simply its off-handed display of the cream 
of British actors: Derek Jacobi, Alec Guinness, Miriam Margolyes, Roshan Seth, 
Joan Greenwood, Eleanor Bron, Cyril Cusack, but the toughness and 
accomplishment with which director Christine Edzard's adaptation makes Dickens 
as pertinent as this week's stock-fixing headlines. 
</P>
<P>
The qualities which made George Bernard Shaw call the novel "more seditious 
than "Das Kapital" are here in abundance and Edzard asks that we see the story 
in two films, six hours in all; however her method is not epic but intimate. By 
the time we have come to Dorrit's triumphant conclusion, the faces, and voices 
of London at that time, the working poor as well as the drawling rich, have 
been stamped upon us forever. 
</P>
<P>
3. "A Cry in the Dark" is an angry film, an outraged one really, as director 
Fred Schepisi lays out the almost unbelieveable path of Australian 
jurisprudence and/or media hijinks by which a bereft mother became, in the eyes 
of the public, the ritual killer of her own infant daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Its power comes from Schepisi's blend of passion and detachment and from the 
best performance Meryl Streep has given so far. (Do we seem to write this each 
year? If so, it's true -- this is a talent you can watch deepen and become 
further refined with each role.) Streep has a perfectly matched thoroughbred 
opposite her in Sam Neill; he makes this Seventh Day Adventist pastor's fall 
from smugness and self-assurance a wracking business. 
</P>
<P>
4. "Salaam, Bombay!" throws us into the life of Bombay's street kids with an 
ebullience and an energy that's matched exactly by the film's tough-mindedness. 
Director Mira Nair asks for no pity for her urchins and she doesn't romanticize 
them either, but there is no way you cannot be haunted by them. "Salaam 
Bombay!" is not Nair's first film about exploitation as a way of life in 
India's cities, but it is her first non-documentary and she brings to her work 
a wonderful eye and a truly cinematic flair for story telling. As you leave 
10-year old Krishna, you may be reminded of "The 400 Blows," sacrilegious as 
that may sound. But "Salaam Bombay!" didn't win Nair the Camera D'Or at Cannes 
in 1988, for best new director, for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
5. In a year of largely literal films, the poetry of Wim Wenders' "Wings of 
Desire" soars, on the wings of his two Berliner angels, with Peter Handke's 
screenplay and with the camera of Henri Alekan, who might be considered 
something of an expert on black and white fairy tales, since it was he who also 
photographed "Beauty and the Beast." Peter Falk gives the film a wry, gutsy 
center, but its essence is its passionate declaration of the need for trust, 
love and commitment; a cheerfully anachronistic, contagiously optimistic tack. 
6. In a way, Austrian director Percy Adlon was working on the same wavelength 
in "Bagdad Cafe" that Wenders was in "Wings of Desire," although Adlon was 
playing a little more with the elements of personal discovery. Those qualities 
make "Bagdad Cafe" a slow-burning fuse, whose charm grows on you like its great 
and haunting song, "I'm Calling You." 
</P>
<P>
Its story of two heartily unalike women, the American CCH Pounder, the Bavarian 
Marianne Sagebrecht, who meet and join forces against a largely disinterested 
world in the California desert, depends largely on the charm of ex-cabaret 
artist Sagebrecht and long-time theater actress Pounder. Both of them are 
exceptional, but Sagebrecht carries a special something extra, as anyone who 
saw her in "Sugarbaby" will remember. 
</P>
<P>
7. Ostensibly about a "failed" car manufacturer, "Tucker," is Francis Ford 
Coppola's tribute to America's loners, its dreamers, whether they make 
ballpoint pens, or vast unflyable airplanes like the film's enigma, Howard 
Hughes. (Or, by the smallest stretch, if they make roundly disliked movies.) 
Loose-limbed and innovative, fueled by a full-throttle performance by Jeff 
Bridges as Tucker, it's a film that could have used more of the darker tones of 
Tucker's life -- heaven knows there were enough of them. But scenes like the 
launching of "The car of tomorrow, today" or the mysterioso meeting between 
Tucker and Dean Stockwell's Howard Hughes do a lot toward shutting down minor 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
8. The beauty and control David Cronenberg uses to tell his melancholy, macabre 
tale of symbiotic twin doctors in "Dead Ringers" shows the director at a new 
high of maturity, and Jeremy Irons' dual portrayal as one bordering on the 
eerie. Dealing, again, with the body, its mysteries and its final frightening 
independence from what we would have it do, "Dead Ringers"' twins are loosely 
based on a real Manhattan pair, but they are more plainly metaphors for any 
relationship that begins in love and ends in pathology. To think of a film this 
assured, this unified and this dizzyingly potent, you have to go back to "Blue 
Velvet." 
</P>
<P>
9. "Red Sorghum" makes you suspect that its director, 37-year old Zhang Yimou, 
was cinema-doomed from the cradle: His saga, which ends during the Japanese 
invasion of China, is part folk-tale, part love story and completely thrilling 
to behold. To credit this as Zhang's directorial debut is not to tell the whole 
story: before this he has also been a masterly cinematographer ("Yellow Earth," 
"The Big Parade) and an actor whose performance in "The Old Well" won him first 
prize at Tokyo's Film Festival. It's especially interesting to see a film from 
modern China with the scale and sensibilities about nature of the Kurosawa of 
"Dersu Uzala." 
</P>
<P>
10. After you see "A World Apart" you realize that the great film about South 
Africa is still waiting to be made. However, this personal one, the homage by a 
daughter to her martyred mother -- the first white woman jailed under South 
Africa's 90-day detention law -- as empathetically directed by Chris Menges, is 
a firm step in that direction. Three memorably fine performances came out of 
this: Barbara Hershey and young Jodhi May as mother and daughter; Linda Mvusi 
as their housekeeper. If somehow the facts of existence in South Africa had 
escaped you, " A World Apart" might be the perfect place to start. 
</P>
<P>
Those hotly close runners-up are "Punchline," "The Moderns," "Babette's Feast," 
"8 Men Out," "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown," "Last Temptation of 
Christ," "Hotel Terminus: the Life and times of Klaus Barbie," "Track 29," 
"Vincent" and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit."

MORE FILM FAVORITES OF 1988 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Unbearable Lightness of Being" -- It was a year of superb novel 
adaptations, "Little Dorrit" included. But Milan Kundera's tale of love, 
politics, sex and repression in '60s-'70s Czechoslovakia was fashioned here, by 
director Philip Kaufman, into a genuine watershed American film: A startling 
departure -- in form, style, psychological and social content -- from almost 
all of the '80s' mainline U.S. studio product. 
</P>
<P>
"The Last Temptation of Christ" -- Did most of the people who kicked up the 
fuss really see Martin Scorsese's movie -- or understand what they saw? From 
Kazantzakis' novel, a firmly Christian work of high idealism, beautifully 
mounted, not intentionally lewd or blasphemous; only Paul Schrader's 
street-tough dialogue keeps it from being a masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
"Melo" -- Henri Bernstein's tense play about a tragic quadrangle in a world of 
classical musicians: The very title suggests "melodrama," and director Alain 
Resnais has defiantly refused to "open it up." Never moving from an obvious 
proscenium set, it somehow seems to distill the soul of theater, the beating 
heart of 1929 Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"Wings of Desire" -- Writer Peter Handke, master cinematographer Henri Alekan 
and director Wim Wenders -- cinematic poet of alienated loners on the road -- 
create an eerie, rapt modern fairy tale in which Berlin angels watch over the 
monochrome world of the lost and lonely and yearn for the bright colored day of 
passion, circuses and love. 
</P>
<P>
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit" -- A monstrous high-voltage audience-hit from 
director Robert Zemeckis, that, like John McTiernan's "Die Hard," was also a 
technical marvel. I'd like the last trip to Toonvile to be more surrealistic, 
crazier; otherwise, it doesn't miss a trick. 
</P>
<P>
"A Taxing Woman" -- Through the Byzantine financial catacombs of modern Japan, 
a piquant tax investigator pursues a swaggering cheat. Director Juzo Itami 
("Tampopo,") gives us a wry, piercing, hawk-eyed view of his country's new 
commercialism, its loss of tradition and the samurai heart that seems to beat 
beneath it's plexiglass shield. 
</P>
<P>
"The Moderns" -- Supposedly it takes place in the expatriate's Paris of 1926, 
but actually this movie -- drifting along on its cloud of soft jazz, 
overlapping banter and wine-rich colors -- is set in no real landscape at all. 
A sweet, devious meditation on art, love, life and artifice; the most special 
and delightful of Alan Rudolph's films. 
</P>
<P>
"Tucker" -- Cars and conspiracies, invention and intimidation, flash and free 
enterprise; Francis Coppola strongly reclaims his turf. A full-throated shout 
of American optimism, tinged with fatalism and a canny awareness of the traps 
awaiting any dreamer. 
</P>
<P>
"Bird" -- A jazz lover's dream: A song in darkness, joy wrung out of grief. No 
director this year showed more devotion to his/her subject matter than Clint 
Eastwood in this soulful elegy to Charlie Parker and the world of '40s-'50s 
be-bop. 
</P>
<P>
"Long Live the Lady!" -- A neglected little gem, by Ermanno Olmi, that I like 
as much as the better-known culinary fable "Babette's Feast" (not to mention 
its wonderful Danish compatriot, "Pelle the Conqueror"). It's a community 
comedy about lower-class waiters at a lavish Italian mountaintop business 
banquet; a feast that becomes, like Babette's, a metaphor for all the traps of 
society, all the divisions of life.

<P>
1988: IT WAS A BATTLE; 
</P>
<P>
BUT LATC -- AND OTHERS -- CAME THROUGH WITH STRONG SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A surprising amount of good work got done in Los Angeles theater in 1988, 
considering that it was a war year. 
</P>
<P>
For months, Actors' Equity and the smaller theaters fought out the question of 
how to compensate Waiver actors. This at least established the principle that 
Waiver actors deserved compensation. But it also used up a lot of energy. By 
year's end, you had to hope that the Waiver wars were winding down: Everybody 
was sick of them. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the smaller theaters got on with it. A fine young writer named Jamie 
Baker had a double debut. His "Don't Go Back to Rockville" was first seen at 
the Pacific Theatre Ensemble, then at the Victory Theatre. Set in 1944, it 
concerned a surly young Kentucky Derby jockey named Ed (Andrew Philpot). His 
unaffectionate progeny turned up a few months later at the Tamarind Theater in 
Baker's "South Central Rain." 
</P>
<P>
Ed and his nasty-nice spawn didn't have a lot to recommend them as human 
beings, but they had a sneaky vitality as stage characters. They suggested 
Lanford Wilson's Talley clan, except that they didn't come off as "characters," 
but as people with real needs -- even if selfish ones. Volume Three of this 
family saga is awaited with interest. 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Lima also hit the mark with "El Salvador" at the Gnu Theatre. The scene 
here was a hotel room from which a group of journalists were trying to cover 
the war in El Salvador without getting their heads shot off, and the message 
was that this kind of life can get to be addictive. An oddly effective 
combination of "The Front Page" and "Apocalypse Now," tautly directed by the 
Gnu's Jeff Seymour. 
</P>
<P>
It was an election year, and the Bush-Dukakis debates provided playacting of a 
dim sort. But there weren't many overtly political plays. Jeff Goldsmith's 
"McCarthy" at the Odyssey came closest, a somewhat overwritten script, but with 
two lean and mean performances: Victor Brandt as Tail Gunner Joe and Ralph 
Seymour as Roy Cohn. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS remained a scourge. "Jerker" -- the notorious script by Robert Chesley 
that the FCC had found pornographic when it was performed on KPFK -- got a live 
production at the Fifth Estate Theatre. It ended with a tired voice saying, 
over a Judy Garland record, that he couldn't come to the phone right now but 
please leave a message. No more needed to be said. 
</P>
<P>
In larger theaters, the best work, and certainly the most work, was done by the 
Los Angeles Theatre Center. Not everything that LATC attempted came off, but 
each of its shows had a reason for being and left a sense that somebody at the 
theater was in its corner. 
</P>
<P>
LATC introduced us to two playwrights with imagination and control, Jose Rivera 
and Marlane Meyer. Rivera was born in Puetro Rico, and his "The Promise" was a 
wild juxtaposition of family drama and tall tale, set in a world as real as a 
rusty muffler, yet a world where demons came and went. Marlane Meyer gave us 
two plays, "Etta Jenks" and "Kingfish." The first brought back to life the 
cliche of the girl who goes to the dogs when she tries to break into the 
movies. Meyer's script worked because it dealt with the grungy Hollywood that 
actually exists, as opposed to the Oz of popular imagination; and because Meyer 
didn't waste any time sentimentalizing over Etta. (Actress Deirdre O'Connell 
didn't sentimentalize her, either.) 
</P>
<P>
"Kingfish" concerned a non-existent dog who nonetheless existed, since it was 
to the interest of certain parties that he do so. This could have been a 
terribly precious play. Perhaps the conceptual framework imposed on it by 
director David Schweizer was a bit precious. But, again, Meyer knew her people. 
She knew, for instance, that a lonely bachelor (Buck Henry) might covet a son 
(Merritt Butrick) so badly that he would pay to have one. This script didn't go 
any farther out than human behavior does. We're just not used to seeing it go 
this far in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
LATC also took on the Russians. Stein Winge's nightmarish production of "The 
Inspector General" got all tangled up in its bedclothes, but Ron Campbell 
proved wonderfully idiotic in the lead. Charles Marowitz's staging of "The Sea 
Gull" was dead-on: a production that called Chekhov's characters to account, 
rather than issuing them a blanket pardon because they were all so sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bushnell's staging of Alexander Galin's "Stars in the Morning Sky" didn't 
redeem a pedestrian script about some played-out whores in "protective custody" 
during the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Nevertheless, as with "Sarcophagus" in '87, 
the play was an interesting theater event -- further proof that Soviet 
playwrights no longer have to pretend that they live in Utopia. 
</P>
<P>
This was the pattern at LATC last year: Even when the play fell short, the 
viewer could grab onto something. Another example: Chloe Webb's exuberant 
performance as the schizophrenic daughter in "The Model Apartment." LATC is on 
a roll these days: You can feel the energy in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
The only time you felt that energy in the Mark Taper Forum lobby in '88 was 
after "The Colored Museum." Younger viewers, black and white, had been 
exhilarated by the anger in George C. Wolfe's script, while older people 
suspected that Wolfe was reviving the hurtful black stereotypes of the past, 
under the guise of satirizing them. 
</P>
<P>
Few other Taper plays proved so stimulating: Certainly not its yuppified 
production of George Walker's "Nothing Sacred." It was good to see Joe Chaikin 
back at Taper, Too. Director Robert Woodruff kept Sam Shepard's loose-jointed 
"A Lie of the Mind" all in one piece. Ron Taylor gave a tremendous supporting 
performance in 
</P>
<P>
"Lost Highway." But it was a season that said "Me, too" rather than, as in the 
old days at the Taper, "Look at this!" Or are we romanticizing the old days? 
</P>
<P>
"Fences" was the Doolittle's big hit, with James Earl Jones even more resonant 
than he had been on Broadway, and Lynne Thigpen taking no garbage as his wife. 
Another August Wilson play, "Joe Turner's Come and Gone," played the Old Globe 
Theatre prior to Broadway, with Delroy Lindo as a self-flaying fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena Playhouse, once given up for dead, had a fine year. Amanda McBroom 
starred in the splendid "Lies and Legends," based on Harry Chapin's songs. The 
show later transferred to Beverly Hills. We can't understand why Robert 
Harling's beauty-parlor comedy "Steel Magnolias" didn't make a similar 
transfer. Barbara Rush and the rest of the cast loved doing it, the audience 
loved watching it, and even a critic had to acknowledge that behind the sitcom 
rhythms, there was a genuine admiration here for the way women can get it 
together. 
</P>
<P>
As opposed to men. Jules Feiffer's "Carnal Knowledge" at the Playhouse had 
Gregory Harrison and David Marshall Grant as two guys who treat women like The 
Enemy, and end up sandbagging themselves. This was also the predicament of Sean 
Penn, Danny Aiello and the other scuzzy Hollywood guys in "Hurlyburly," staged 
by playwright David Rabe at the Westwood Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Disgracefully, the "Hurlyburly" company canceled a performance just before 
curtain-time, the excuse being that their friend Gary Busey had just had a 
motorcycle accident. The professional reaction, in this circumstance, is to 
dedicate the performance to your friend and go on. Nonetheless, Penn and his 
colleagues -- including Mare Winningham as the toughest of their lady friends 
-- gave "Hurlyburly" one hell of a ride. 
</P>
<P>
The funniest classical revival of the year was South Coast Repertory's "School 
for Scandal," which director Paul Marcus set in a strange land where 
18th-Century types read the National Enquirer. SCR also brought us an urgent 
revival of "The Crucible," directed by Martin Benson -- one of those shows 
where the audience gasps even when it knows what's coming next. In San Diego, 
the show of the year was the San Diego Repertory Theatre's "Red Noses," Peter 
Barnes' black comedy about the uses of comedy in a bad time. Co-produced with 
the Dell'Arte Players of Blue Lake, Calif., the production combined expert 
clowning and scathing satire. Only one show gave us more pure pleasure during 
1988 -- the Moscow Circus.

POP EYE: CLINKERS AMONG THE POP NOTES OF '88 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everybody hooted last January when Texas record producer (and legendary 
self-promoter) Major Bill Smith concocted an Elvis Presley birthday tribute, 
"Hey! Big E. Happy 53!," claiming The King had faked his death so he could live 
in anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
But Major Bill had the last laugh. In a year when Brian Wilson, Patti Smith and 
Jimmy Page's comebacks flopped, Elvis had the biggest revival of all, making 
tabloid headlines, starring in Priscilla's best-seller and being celebrated in 
a musical about his life. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year, you got the feeling Elvis was on tour again -- popping 
up at Burger Kings in Kalamazoo, car washes in Georgia and the parking lot of a 
Las Vegas hotel. In August, WCVG in Cincinnati switched to an all-Elvis format. 
In September, Cheap Trick's "Don't Be Cruel" became the first Elvis re-make to 
go Top 10. In November, Priscilla and Lisa Marie did an Olds ad. In December, 
an L.A. Elvis impersonator announced plans to turn his San Fernando Valley home 
into a mock Graceland. 
</P>
<P>
Even without Elvis, 1988 was a banner year for pop follies. So let's celebrate 
the music world's clown princes in our yearly round-up of dubious achievements, 
inglorious moments and show-biz scams. 
</P>
<P>
PRESENTER OF THE YEAR: Beach Boy Mike Love, who livened up the 1988 Rock and 
Roll Hall of Fame Awards by noisily blasting Mick Jagger: "We did 180 
performances last year. . . . I'd like to see Mick Jagger get on stage and do 
'I Get Around' rather than 'Jumpin' Jack Flash.' Mick's always been chicken to 
get on stage with the Beach Boys." 
</P>
<P>
JAIL SENTENCE: To the Yugoslav folk singer who was sentenced to 60 days in jail 
and fined $80 for refusing to sing "Comrade Tito, We Pledge to You That We Will 
Not Swerve From Your Path," an official state song glorifying Marshal Tito, 
founder of the country's Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
PRINCE FAN: Richard Nixon, who titled his latest political tract "1999." 
</P>
<P>
NATIONAL ANTHEM PERFORMANCE: Saxophonist Kenny G, whose anthem rendition at the 
sixth game of the National League playoffs here was blasted as "unbelievably 
terrible" by Dodger second baseman Steve Sax. "I can't believe it. It was the 
worst I ever heard. I could have played it better than he did," said Sax, who 
was so upset that he shook his fist at G while walking back to the dugout. 
Dodger right fielder Mike Marshall added: "It was a disgrace to America." 
</P>
<P>
QUOTE, PART 1: Debbie Gibson: "On Halloween, I had a party where we had a 
seance. We tried to contact Liberace and Sid Vicious." 
</P>
<P>
DRUG BUST: Reporting that soul legend James Brown was charged for possession of 
the hallucinogenic drug PCP after a car chase through two states this fall, 
Rolling Stone quoted a Georgia Highway patrolman who said that when arrested, 
Brown "started singing 'Georgia' and was doing his 'Good Foot' dance when we 
gave him the sobriety test." 
</P>
<P>
GRAMMY ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: Best Female Country Vocal Performance winner K.T. 
Oslin, who told the press: "I'm so excited that I feel like I'm going to throw 
up any minute now." 
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC ADDRESS ANNOUNCER: Paul Strelzin, announcer for the Texas League's El 
Paso Diablos, was ejected from a game against the Jackson Mets after 
infuriating umpires by repeatedly playing the verse "I've been cheated, been 
mistreated" from Linda Ronstadt's "When Will I Be Loved" after a series of 
close calls at first base. 
</P>
<P>
BACKSTAGE STIFF: When ex-Ollie North secretary Fawn Hall asked to meet Bruce 
Springsteen backstage at his Washington concert, she received a note saying: "I 
didn't think much of Ollie North, so why should I want to meet his secretary?" 
</P>
<P>
QUOTE, PART 2: Terence Trent D'Arby: "I've had three lives: The first time I 
was an Ethiopian pirate around 600 BC. Then I was an 18th-Century painter. The 
last time I was a very talented but unsuccessful country and Western singer." 
</P>
<P>
RAMONES FAN: Celebrated Manhattan preppie-killer Robert Chambers. He donned a 
shoulder-length wig and imitated Ramones leader Joey Ramone singing "Rockaway 
Beach" on a videotape that an ex-girlfriend sold to a local New York TV 
station, which aired the clip earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
SUBPOENA: When contestants in a lawsuit involving former MCA artist Donnie Iris 
couldn't persuade MCA Records chairman Irving Azoff to testify in a lawsuit 
hearing, they served the industry mogul with a subpoena at the Forum during 
half time of a Lakers-Spurs playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
DEEJAY: After the Baltimore Orioles lost 10 straight games, Baltimore morning 
deejay Bob Rivers swore he would stay locked in his WIYY-FM studio until the 
team won a game. He ended up stuck on the air for 258 straight hours until the 
team ended its record 21-game losing streak last April. 
</P>
<P>
WORST BAND NAME: Johnny Hates Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
MOLL: Dolly Parton, who totes a gun -- legally -- and said she pulled it out of 
her purse when accosted by a man when she was walking in New York this summer. 
"I pointed it at him and told him if he didn't take a hike, I'd turn him into a 
soprano." 
</P>
<P>
LED ZEPPELIN FAN: Spago impresario Wolfgang Puck, who apparently forgot that 
Jimmy Page was the band's guitar hero. When ex-Zeppelin singer Robert Plant was 
in town for a summer concert appearance, Puck presented him with a 
guitar-shaped pizza. 
</P>
<P>
QUOTE, PART 3: Washington Wife crusader Tipper Gore: "I love rock 'n' roll. I 
was one of the earliest Springsteen fans. I played drums in high school. You're 
talking to someone who really understands rock music." 
</P>
<P>
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: During last year's February sweeps, KABC-TV ballyhooed a 
chat with ex-Beatle George Harrison as an "exclusive" interview -- even though 
Harrison complained throughout the story about "all these interviews" he had 
been doing. 
</P>
<P>
MANAGER: Doc McGhee, whose management firm handles such pop superstars as Bon 
Jovi and Motley Crue, pleaded guilty last January to importing 40,000 pounds of 
marijuana, worth $9 million, into the United States. The indictment came weeks 
after McGhee and partner Doug Thaler were named personal managers of the year 
in Pollstar magazine's Readers Poll Awards. 
</P>
<P>
OVERSTATEMENT: When the American Cinematheque screened the rarely seen Sex 
Pistols documentary, "The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle" in January, festival 
organizers ballyhooed the showing as "the last U.S. screening ever." This came 
as a surprise to Julien Temple, the film's director, who quipped: "What are 
they going to do -- burn it?" 
</P>
<P>
FRAGRANCE: John Lennon's first wife, Cynthia, took advantage of the hoopla 
surrounding her late husband by launching a new fragrance, Woman perfume. The 
fragrance was named after the song "Woman," from Lennon's "Double Fantasy" 
album, even though the ballad was written for Yoko Ono, the woman Lennon left 
Cynthia to marry. 
</P>
<P>
REUNION: When the Stray Cats held a press conference in August to herald the 
band getting back together after a four-year layoff, the group somehow 
neglected to mention that they had recorded a reunion album two years ago -- 
which stiffed. 
</P>
<P>
MAGAZINE ISSUE: Spin magazine's November issue, which contained a free condom 
in each copy as a symbol of the editors' support for safe sex practices.

L.A. BEAT: BEST OF '88 WON'T SHATTER ANY TRENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If your great-aunt's bridge club donned leather cycle duds and power-chorded 
its way through songs about life in the gutter, it'd probably stand a good 
chance of getting a record deal. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's the way it seems, considering the hard-rock feeding frenzy on 
the part of record companies in the wake of Guns N' Roses' multi-platinum 
breakthrough. And with Geffen having snapped up such promising bands as Little 
Caesar and Junkyard, there's no reason to think that frenzy won't continue well 
into 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the continually healthy street-metal crowd had much competition this 
year: 
</P>
<P>
The best thing you could say about the rest of the L.A. rock scene in 1988 was 
that nothing really coalesced into any kind of movement that would be easy for 
trendoids and sycophants to glom onto, meaning that many worthy acts around 
town were free to develop on their own and not worry about fitting into a 
"scene." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the worst thing about the L.A. rock scene in 1988 was that 
nothing new really coalesced into any kind of movement that would produce an 
irresistible buzz, meaning that many worthy acts around town didn't get the 
attention they deserved. 
</P>
<P>
After all, what does it say about the vitality of the local club circuit when 
one of the brightest pop hopes to emerge from L.A. in 1988 -- Melissa Etheridge 
-- determined that playing the clubs was a waste of time and elected to build 
her career through playing beach community taverns? 
</P>
<P>
And who would have thought that the local independent act to get the most media 
attention would be Ailee Willis "discoverees," the Del Rubio Triplets, three 
middle-aged sisters who apply their harmonies to the likes of "Walk Like an 
Egyptian" and Willis' "Neutron Dance," and make most of their concert 
appearances at nursing and retirement homes? 
</P>
<P>
There are, though, two promising trends that began to emerge in '88: Nu Folk 
(the name's gotta go) and the latest edition of L.A. psychedelia. 
</P>
<P>
Such clubs as Bogart's, Club Lingerie and the Music Machine suddenly swung open 
their doors to acoustic troubadours, while new clubs like the Breakaway and the 
Gaslight were created specifically for that low-key approach. (The revived Ash 
Grove couldn't make it, though.) 
</P>
<P>
Nu names to watch: meaning-seeker Mark Davis and witty social observer Milo 
Binder seem the most likely to make a mark, while bands Different World and the 
Beef Sisters could develop into contenders as well. 
</P>
<P>
Among the murky mind-expansion brigade, Jane's Addiction is certainly the most 
prominent, while fellow late-night denizen Caterwaul also seems a good 
candidate for big things, based on the preview EP I.R.S. has just issued. An 
album from the Betsy Martin-fronted quartet is due early this year. The stable 
of psyche-rock purveyors at Nate Starkman &amp; Son records also seems quite 
promising, with Shiva Burlesque, the best of the bunch, reportedly getting some 
major label attention these days. 
</P>
<P>
The best live club act this year was Mary's Danish, which combines the droll 
wit and delivery of singers Julie Ritter and Gretchen Seager with a wild, loose 
funk-rock sound. American Martyrs and the Bel-Fires have also both developed 
strong live presences that seem ripe for big-label vinyl. 
</P>
<P>
The Wild Cards, who released a debut LP "Cool Not Cold," also could (finally) 
be the band to follow fellow Latinos Los Lobos to national attention. And the 
country world offers potential matinee idol Jim Lauderdale (a debut album 
coming soon from Epic), country-rock songstresses Lucinda Williams (a new album 
that more than lives up to her good name around local clubs) and Kimm Rogers.

SOUND &amp; VISION: A LONG SEARCH FOR THE BEST PERFECT VIDEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sound &amp; Vision searched the tube over, channel after channel, in search of 
quality rock video clips that would reflect consenting adults enjoying normal, 
healthy relationships. We found exactly . . . one. To round out most of the 
other nine slots in our 1988 Video Top 10, we had to settle for well-executed 
renditions of the same old song and dance. 
</P>
<P>
The year's best: 
</P>
<P>
1. Joni Mitchell's "My Secret Place" (Director: Anton Corbijn). Perhaps one of 
the few videos ever made to convey such emotional intimacy, "Secret" dramatized 
a fetching Mitchell and glowing duet partner Peter Gabriel quietly bonding over 
dinner (!). Warm, subtle and recognizably human, it naturally received almost 
no airplay. 
</P>
<P>
2. George Harrison's "When We Was Fab" (Godley &amp; Creme). If the "Magical 
Mystery Tour" film had lived up to its potential, it might have had the charm 
of this effects-filled clip, a bit of winsome but hard-edged nostalgia for the 
more psychedelic days of the Fab Four. 
</P>
<P>
3. Michael Jackson's "Smooth Criminal" (Colin Chilvers). A silly but eminently 
watchable (and rewatchable) 10-minute all-singing, all-dancing extravaganza 
that's a marked return to video form for the Gloved One. The best rhythm track 
off Jackson's "Bad" album is combined with fresh choreography that shows the 
Fred Astaire comparisons may not be so off base after all. 
</P>
<P>
4. Bruce Springsteen's "One Step Up" (Meiert Avis). Though set in a 
working-class bar atmosphere far removed from Springsteen's daily life, this 
tone poem on marital alienation and straying affections held more resonance for 
many curious viewers -- like much of the "Tunnel of Love" album -- in the face 
of subsequent events. 
</P>
<P>
5. Nancy Sinatra's "These Boots Are Made for Walkin"' (Robert Sidney). A 
re-release of a 22-year-old clip, "Boots" demonstrated that -- even with 
then-acceptable cellulite and relatively modest mini-skirts -- Nancy and her 
booted dancing partners could out-fox Lita Ford any day. 
</P>
<P>
6. Roy Orbison's "Oh Pretty Woman" (Tony Mitchell). Excerpted from the 
star-studded cable-TV gala filmed at the Cocoanut Grove. What's that we see? 
He's walkin' back to us . . . in mementos like this video, at least, if -- 
sadly -- no longer in life. 
</P>
<P>
7. Steve Winwood's "Roll With It" (David Finchman). What a wonderful fantasy: A 
night out at a sweaty, sepia-toned, racially integrated bar in which Winwood 
leads the house soul band. 
</P>
<P>
8. LL Cool J's "Goin' Back to Cali" (Ric Menello). A New York rapper's-eye-view 
of a return to L.A. in which all the cliches (palm trees, cruising) somehow 
look fresh. 
</P>
<P>
9. Weird Al Yankovic's "Fat" (Jay Levy). Combine the non-stop obesity jokes on 
the sound track with the non-stop Michael Jackson parody on the screen -- one 
big non sequitur if ever there was one -- and what you get is a tasteless, 
pointlessly hilarious guilty pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
10. Sam Brown's "Stop" (Eric Watson). A blond. A red dress. A soulful voice 
tackling a slow blues ballad. Sometimes life's simplest pleasures are best.

THE BLOSSOMING OF L.A. ARTISTS IN '88.; 
</P>
<P>
MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR PRICES FOR 'PRICELESS' PIECES WERE NUMBING, BUT OUT HERE 
THE OUTLOOK IS DOWN-TO-EARTH

<P>
Well, it's over again. Bits of pastel serpentine weave through the carpet and a 
champagne cork is wedged into the potted palm. Time to stare out at the garden 
and ruminate on '88. 
</P>
<P>
It might have gone down as the year when the tainted opulence of Post-Modernism 
was in full flower, the spectacle of an art world where aesthetics are swamped 
by jillionaire collectors flourishing power. 
</P>
<P>
Winter: Armand Hammer announced he would jerk his blue-chip collection away 
from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art where it had been promised repeatedly 
for nearly 20 years. Hammer decided to establish his own private boutique 
museum in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
Spring: Negotiations aimed at bringing Norton Simon's fabled collections under 
the stewardship of UCLA guttered out. 
</P>
<P>
Summer: The annual confrontation between the J. Paul Getty Museum and Thomas 
Hoving's Connoisseur magazine arrived with the predictability of the gas bill. 
The Getty bought a rare ancient Greek Aphrodite and Hoving said it had been 
smuggled out of Italy. Something similar had happened the year before. And the 
year before that. 
</P>
<P>
Fall: New York auctions turned into a feeding frenzy that drove prices for 
modern art to stratospheric obscenity. A Jasper Johns brought $17 million. A 
Picasso at $24.75 million, then another in London for $38.5 million. Sales 
totals in the hundreds of millions. 
</P>
<P>
Felt like the Last Days of Pompeii, lavish hysteria. 
</P>
<P>
Remember when great art was called "priceless"? There was something nice about 
that. "Priceless" said it doesn't matter if a work of art sells for $50 or $50 
million, the experience of it is about something else, something delicate, 
numinous and poetic. Hard figures vulgarize the expression like a price tag put 
on the act of love. 
</P>
<P>
It could have been remembered as a year of fascinating naughty titivating 
tattle out of "Life Styles of the Rich and Arrogant" but things happened in Los 
Angeles that evidence significance. A generation of artists who were once art's 
quirky Young Turks came to mature fulfillment. 
</P>
<P>
This gratifying harvest was probably best symbolized by a man who is not a 
painter or a sculptor but an architect. Frank Gehry has long been the L.A. art 
world's architect -- openly and deeply influenced by everybody from Billy Al 
Bengston to Robert Irwin. His year began with a traveling retrospective at the 
Museum of Contemporary Art. It was a triumph of exhibition design including 
recreations of copper-clad spiral rooms, a walk-in fish used as an office by 
somebody with Jonah-in-the-whale fantasies, cardboard tables and chairs that 
looked like bats wearing bearskin coats, all wonderfully imaginative and gently 
tough. 
</P>
<P>
The next thing you knew, Gehry was the centerpiece of a New York exhibition 
god-fathered by Philip Johnson. Titled "Deconstructivist Architecture," it 
placed Gehry at the wellspring position among an international group searching 
for ways to revivify the modernist structural vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
By year's end, architectural critics had praised him as the most important 
practitioner in the country. He became a rare prophet in his own land when he 
finally received a commission for a key cultural building, the Disney Pavilion 
at the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
No discouraging word was heard around Gehry's apotheosis. Clearly deserved, it 
was nothing but justice done. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the year was punctuated with echoes of the L.A. aesthetic coming to 
mature ripening. David Hockney's retrospective at LACMA found the transplanted 
Brit intelligent, urbane, witty and curious. This artist, who virtually created 
L.A.'s own hedonistic image of itself -- reflected in the whiplash ripples of 
its pools -- left us a lot to ponder. Hockney -- sometimes seen as a 
lightweight who fritters away his gifts on opera sets and Polaroid montages -- 
can no more be denied the underlying seriousness of his purpose than could Noel 
Coward. 
</P>
<P>
As the months rolled by, the sense of L.A. coming into its own just kept on 
blossoming. There were external events such as the opening of LACMA's pavilion 
for Japanese Art. Housing Joe D. Price's superb collection of Edo period 
painting in an imaginative and apt building by the late Bruce Goff provided a 
curiously exotic harmonic to LACMA's diverse architectural styles. Curator 
Stephanie Barron confirmed her expertise and originality in the exhibition 
"German Expressionism, The Second Generation." 
</P>
<P>
But artists -- L.A. artists -- managed to hold center stage. Bengston's 
retrospective, still on view at LACMA, added itself to Hockney, and a look back 
at Richard Diebenkorn's works on paper headed this way in March from New York. 
There is an unexpected overlap in their work, in its shared tropical pastel 
palette and fundamental concern with timeless questions of drawing and 
composition. They share a degree of calm mastery. 
</P>
<P>
Count in the sculptor Robert Graham, whose LACMA showing of his monument to 
Duke Ellington found him more flexible and more calmly assured than ever. 
</P>
<P>
But it was old Ed Moses who came sidewinding out of the chute like a buckaroo 
on a stoned pony. Paintings seen at L.A. Louver certainly constituted the 
commercial gallery show of the year, with their crazy Pollock-ribbons of paint 
kicking open deep space with all the control of a Frank Stella. If a full-dress 
Moses retrospective is not in the works, there just ain't no justice. 
</P>
<P>
And it was not just The Boys who came up smiling. L.A.'s enduring maverick's 
maverick Joyce Treiman was reviewed in a USC exhibition. Her classic painterly 
realist diary of haunted art fantasies and spiritual insight revealed new 
depths to even her closest observers. 
</P>
<P>
And LACMA tipped our hat to Helen Lundeberg, who was painting around here when 
our ranking patriarchs were still on tricycles. 
</P>
<P>
It left us all knowing that making real art takes a long time. This amazing 
payoff represents at least three decades of artistic ripening. It was all begun 
when things were very focused around here. People who paid attention knew all 
the artists who counted and followed their work in great detail. The people who 
made the work had anybody's normal dreams of recognition and reward, but they 
were going to make their art if it meant two-bit second jobs and a lifetime of 
spaghetti and cheap red wine. 
</P>
<P>
In today's sprawling, overpopulated, fast-buck climate, where good artists cave 
in to making corporate decoration and careers blaze and fizzle like flat-tire 
flares, it's hard to know where a comparable generation is going to come from 
in 2025. Art goes on. That there is still serious purpose out there somewhere 
was well attested by the Anselm Kiefer survey at MOCA. There's always hope, but 
the future has a formidable task of sorting ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Funny how nice stuff manages to happen in a climate where every charge of 
vulgarized art and popularized museums is absolutely true. And yet they keep 
managing to engage us deeply with revelatory revivals, such as LACMA's current 
Guido Reni exhibitions, or with once-in-a-lifetime extravaganzas, such as the 
Metropolitan's Degas exhibition or the pageant of Paul Gauguin at the National 
Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Proves there are still good people out there doing the right thing. Proves that 
no matter how fetid the climate, art is still great stuff.

VENEZUELA WILL DELAY PAYING DEBT PRINCIPAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a surprise move, the outgoing president of Venezuela said Saturday that the 
fourth-biggest debtor in Latin America is suspending principal payments on 
nearly all of its $30.3-billion debt to foreign banks. 
</P>
<P>
The move was not as drastic a step as halting interest payments, but it 
highlights a hardening of attitudes among Latin American leaders over the 
worsening economic situation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enormous Toll Reflected 
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, a leading oil exporter, has been a model debtor nation and was the 
only big Latin American debtor to continue making principal payments through 
the 1980s. But the decision Saturday reflects the enormous toll being taken on 
Latin American countries by huge debt payments to foreign banks. 
</P>
<P>
The debt crisis, which is entering its seventh year, has choked off growth in 
many Latin American economies as earnings are devoted to paying foreign debt 
instead of financing local growth. Latin American leaders have warned that 
declining living standards threaten the region's political stability and its 
fledgling democratic governments. 
</P>
<P>
President-elect George Bush said in December that he will order a major review 
of current U.S. strategy for dealing with Third World debt. He told reporters 
that "we've got enormous problems, particularly in our own hemisphere, with 
Third World debt." 
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide television address announcing the Venezuelan suspension of 
payments, President Jaime Lusinchi said, "The problem of foreign debt today 
strangles the economic and social development of the great majority of the 
world's peoples." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oil Revenue Slump 
</P>
<P>
He said he had ordered the suspension, effective Jan. 17, because of the slump 
in revenue from oil exports and what he said were high interest rates on the 
debt. Lusinchi said that Venezuelan officials plan to meet soon with their 
leading creditor banks to negotiate new terms on the loans. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. banker familiar with Venezuela's position said the country wants to 
reduce its loan payments by stretching out the terms of its existing loans. 
</P>
<P>
Between 35% and 40% of the $30.3 billion is owed to U.S. banks. Chase Manhattan 
Bank in New York is Venezuela's leading U.S. lender. San Francisco-based Bank 
of America is the second-largest creditor, with $1.1 billion in long-term and 
medium-term loans. 
</P>
<P>
Donald K. Crowley, a banking industry analyst in the San Francisco office of 
the investment firm of Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, said the suspension's 
impact on U.S. banks would be minimal because none is overexposed in Venezuela. 
But he said the Venezuelan action came as a shock and would be significant if 
it represented a move among Latin American nations to adopt a common approach 
to dealing with foreign creditors, which would give them more bargaining 
leverage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Colombia's Suspension 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Colombia said for the first time that it was suspending payment on 
its $16.5-billion foreign debt for three months until a new $1.7-billion 
international loan is received. 
</P>
<P>
Louis G. Schirano, an executive in the New York offices of Los Angeles-based 
First Interstate Bancorp., said he did not interpret the Venezuelan move as a 
major setback. He said that Venezuela, which will continue paying interest on 
its debt, has simply joined the other Latin debtors in suspending its principal 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
"What banks really care about is the debt service (interest) and that will 
still be flowing," said Schirano, whose bank has divested itself of all 
Venezuelan debt. 
</P>
<P>
Latin America's largest debtor nations are Brazil, $113 billion; Mexico, $108 
billion; and Argentina, $54 billion. Unlike Venezuela, all three have halted 
interest payments to foreign banks at various times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debt Action Urged 
</P>
<P>
The presidents of all four nations, along with three other Latin American 
countries, have urged the United States to make the debt problem a major 
political priority. Bush's remarks about reviewing U.S. efforts have been 
interpreted in some quarters as a move to possibly forgive some portion of the 
huge debt owed to private banks by Third World countries. 
</P>
<P>
The previous U.S. strategy for dealing with the problem, the so-called Baker 
Plan, was designed in 1985 by then-Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, who 
will be Bush's secretary of state. He called for commercial banks and the World 
Bank to provide new loans in return for growth-oriented economic changes in the 
debtor nations. 
</P>
<P>
But new lending has been rare. The 17 countries that are most deeply in debt 
owe $529 billion and paid $14 billion more to creditors than they received in 
new loans in 1987, the latest year for which figures are available. 
</P>
<P>
A U.N. development organization said in September that commercial banks should 
forgive at least 30% of the amount owed by the 15 most heavily indebted Third 
World countries. The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development said that was the 
only way of giving the nations the opportunity to retain enough capital to grow 
faster and repay the remainder of the debt. 
</P>
<P>
While Venezuela's economy is in better shape than that of most of the other 
debtors, the sharp two-year decline in oil prices has caused problems. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the government raised tariffs sharply to restrain imports and 
conserve its cash reserves. Tariffs were increased as much as 160% on about 500 
consumer items, ranging from electronics to liquor.

U.S.-CHINA STRAINS SURFACE; BASIS OF RELATIONSHIP SHIFTS

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the time, Republican presidential contender Ronald Reagan called it "a 
shabby, needless blow." His intra-party rival, George Bush, branded it "an 
abject American retreat." And then-Sen. John Tower (R-Tex.) termed it 
"unconscionable." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such criticism, 10 years ago today, on Jan. 1, 1979, the Jimmy Carter 
Administration broke formal U.S. ties with Taiwan and established diplomatic 
relations with the People's Republic of China. 
</P>
<P>
"We are recognizing a simple reality," President Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
But, as a matter of American foreign policy, it had been anything but simple. 
For nearly three decades, the United States had refused to recognize the 
Communist regime in Beijing and had pretended that the Chinese Nationalists on 
Taiwan were the government for all of China. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 10 years later, the entire relationship between the United States and 
China has changed. New assumptions govern the behavior of both nations, and 
U.S. scholars predict that in the next few years the two governments may find 
themselves in increasing conflict with one another on a number of foreign 
policy questions, such as the Middle East and Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that China and the United States won't be as close as they were 
before," said Thomas W. Robinson of the American Enterprise Institute. "There 
has to be a certain distancing on both sides." 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, during the last decade the U.S. recognition of Beijing -- and 
its avoidance of official dealings with Taiwan -- has become an established, 
accepted fact in American domestic politics. 
</P>
<P>
President Reagan, once one of Taiwan's closest friends in American politics, 
honored the U.S. recognition of Beijing last month by saying he is confident 
that the United States and China will "forge even stronger ties and build a 
safer, more prosperous world." Taiwan, meanwhile, has managed to survive and 
prosper despite its diplomatic isolation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Longer in Tandem 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the United States and China no longer operate in close 
tandem with one another in international affairs in the way that they did a 
decade ago. The common bond of shared opposition to the Soviet Union has frayed 
as the United States and China separately seek warmer ties with the government 
of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an increasing sense that the era in which the bilateral relationship 
(between the United States and China) was based importantly on opposition to 
Moscow has ended," University of Washington Prof. Nicholas R. Lardy wrote 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
During the last two years the United States and China have been at odds over a 
number of issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chinese Arms Sales an Issue 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials voiced bitter complaints about China's arms sales to the Middle 
East, including the sale of Silkworm anti-ship missiles to Iran and 
intermediate-range ballistic missiles to Saudi Arabia. China took umbrage at 
U.S. congressional resolutions denouncing China's policies on human rights and 
in Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
As if to symbolize the current atmosphere of mistrust, China recently imposed 
new travel restrictions on American diplomats working at consulates in the 
Chinese cities of Shenyang and Shanghai. The United States called these curbs 
"unreasonable" and countered by slapping new limits on personnel at the Chinese 
Consulate in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
That sort of reciprocal nastiness would have been unthinkable 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In the first place, the United States and China did not even have any diplomats 
living and working in the heartland of each other's territory. Second, both 
nations were eager to set aside all sources of conflict at the time to work 
together against the perceived Soviet threat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wanted Strategic Partner 
</P>
<P>
"The United States didn't have too much choice," said one West European 
diplomat who follows Chinese affairs. "China was looking for a strategic 
partner against the Soviet Union. It found two countries who were willing to 
play the game: Japan and the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Although President Richard M. Nixon had moved to normalize ties with Beijing 
during his historic 1972 visit to China, neither he nor his successor, 
President Gerald R. Ford, was able to establish diplomatic relations with the 
Communist regime. They were never able to overcome the strong support for 
Taiwan's Nationalist regime in the right wing of the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, for example, the time then-Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) resorted to 
strong-arm tactics against Ford and Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. 
</P>
<P>
One day in May, 1976, Goldwater sent a private ultimatum to the Ford White 
House. He said he had heard a radio report that the Ford Administration was 
planning to establish diplomatic relations with "Red China," either before or 
after the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Don't Intend to Stay Quiet' 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make any sense to me to forgo our friends on Taiwan and I don't 
intend to stay quiet about it, so please within 24 hours let me know what the 
truth is, and I mean the truth," Goldwater wrote. He threatened to withdraw 
political support for Ford, who was then being challenged by Reagan for the 
Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
According to files at the Gerald R. Ford presidential library, Ford and 
Kissinger were forced to cave in. Within a day, Kissinger called Goldwater and 
gave him the assurances that were necessary to avoid a public dispute. 
</P>
<P>
It was left to Carter, a Democratic President, to take the political heat of 
recognizing China, and he, too, delayed doing so until soon after the 1978 
congressional elections. When Carter finally made the public announcement, on 
Dec. 15, 1978, he was immediately savaged by conservative Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Within a month, Reagan was not only criticizing Carter's recognition of 
Beijing, but also advocating "continuation of government-to-government 
relations between the United States and Taiwan." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reagan Brought Testy Period 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's arrival in the White House precipitated a testy period in which China 
was unsure how much support the new President would give to Taiwan. The tension 
eased with a 1982 agreement limiting U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and, ultimately, 
with Reagan's own election-year visit to China in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
During that trip, the President minimized the ideological differences with 
China that had once preoccupied American conservatives by referring to China as 
a "so-called Communist country." 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1980s, the United States and China began to set aside -- or perhaps 
postpone for the future -- their disputes over Taiwan. The two countries even 
began to collaborate on a series of military exchanges, with Pentagon officials 
making regular visits to China and leaders of the Chinese People's Liberation 
Army touring military installations in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But the two sides began to fight over other issues. China, sensitive to charges 
by Third World countries that it was aligning itself too closely with the 
United States, announced that it was conducting an "independent" foreign 
policy. The United States began to complain about China's arms sales overseas 
and to worry about China's continuing support for the murderous Khmer Rouge in 
Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trade and Students 
</P>
<P>
Whenever the two sides bicker, U.S. officials explain that ties with China 
remain strong. They point to the increasing trade between the two countries -- 
more than $13 billion this year -- and the high number of Chinese students, an 
estimated 32,000 to 40,000, being educated at American universities. 
</P>
<P>
One senior Reagan Administration official said last year that China and the 
United States now have a "mature" relationship, suggesting that the two 
countries are like a married couple, able to withstand a good fight once in a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
Some American scholars found such bland explanations irritating. "If I hear one 
more State Department official talk about a 'mature relationship' with China, 
I'm going to scream," said Robinson. "It's as if the Chinese were juveniles 
before now." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, although U.S. officials have gone to great lengths to stress the calm 
and continuity in Sino-American relations, the underlying American attitudes 
toward China have been changing in some significant ways during the last 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deng Toured U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, U.S. officials pinned their hopes for China's future largely on 
China's top political leadership. Within weeks after diplomatic relations were 
established in 1979, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping made a triumphal tour of the 
United States. U.S. officials were effusive in their praise of Deng and the 
reform program he was beginning to launch in China. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Deng is 84, and some American officials and scholars have suggested 
privately that he is becoming arbitrary and erratic in his leadership, in much 
the same way as did Mao Tse-tung in the final years before his death in 1976. 
Last spring, for example, Deng seemed to call for a lifting of price controls 
and then to pull back in the face of a spurt of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials are also critical of some of the Chinese leaders who may succeed 
Deng. Speaking of Chinese Premier Li Peng, who was trained and educated in the 
Soviet Union, one Reagan Administration official said recently: "Li Peng just 
doesn't understand how a market economy works. Things won't really move in 
China until after his years in power." 
</P>
<P>
These days, American hopes for China seem to rest not on its political elite, 
but on broader, long-range developments in Chinese society -- particularly the 
tens of thousands of young students being educated in the United States and the 
market-oriented economic reforms that are taking hold in China at the 
grass-roots. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Divided Over Policy 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, there appear to be serious divisions among American 
policy-makers and scholars about how the United States should approach China in 
the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
Some American experts say that the United States should now base its ties to 
China primarily on economic cooperation and shift focus away from strategic 
factors such as joint opposition to the Soviet Union. "The relationship (with 
China) from the beginning has been premised far too much on anti-Soviet 
factors," Lardy said. 
</P>
<P>
But one Reagan Administration official, who said that he personally agrees with 
this argument, acknowledged: "There are still people in senior policy ranks in 
the United States who view China strictly in strategic terms." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent speech in San Francisco, U.S. Ambassador to China Winston Lord 
declared: "Contrary to some fashionable pundits, I strongly believe strategic 
factors will remain crucial to our cooperation with China. . . . They are more 
muted and nuanced than before. But our two nations share a continuing stake in 
preserving global and regional balances." 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, at the time they established diplomatic relations, the United 
States and China were drawn together by their eagerness to join hands against 
the Soviet Union. Now, American scholars say, nothing between China and the 
United States is quite so easy. 
</P>
<P>
"If people want a clear, compelling basis for U.S.-China relations these days, 
there just isn't going to be one," Harry Harding of the Brookings Institution 
said. "Except that we are two big countries that are going to have to live with 
one another."

GORBACHEV CALLS FOR 'GUMPTION' IN REFORM PUSH 
</P>

<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in a televised New Year's address 
Saturday, called on the Soviet people to stop sitting on the sidelines and to 
show greater "gumption" in pursuing his policy of economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev acknowledged that perestroika, his program to restructure Soviet 
society, had raised high hopes among the citizens that had not yet been met. 
The 57-year-old Kremlin leader, who took office in March of 1985, blamed 
conservative forces in part for the slow pace of reform. 
</P>
<P>
But, using tough language, he also said that every Soviet citizen should do 
more to improve the quality of consumer goods and to end the shortages that 
have typified Soviet life since the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Greater Resoluteness' 
</P>
<P>
"One cannot just outwit life and sit back on the sidelines," Gorbachev said. 
"It is essential to act with greater resoluteness." 
</P>
<P>
He said his attempt to revamp Soviet society "lends wings to real champions . . 
. and gives them added energies and gumption. And this is just what we need now 
most of all." 
</P>
<P>
His remarks seem to respond to critics who complained bitterly to him during a 
trip to Siberia in September of long -- and often unsuccessful -- waits to 
obtain basic consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
Those dramatic encounters were carried on Soviet television, and Western 
analysts said the complaints helped to push Gorbachev to make major 
governmental changes in October, putting reform-minded supporters in positions 
of power. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's year-end speech was broadcast across the country on Soviet 
television just minutes before midnight and was probably widely seen. New 
Year's Eve in the Soviet Union is a family holiday that traditionally includes 
the exchange of gifts and the viewing of special television programs until 
early morning hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not want, and have no right, to paint a rosy overall picture," the 
Communist Party leader said in the broadcast. "Perestroika gave rise to great 
expectations to society, but changes are not coming as fast as we would all 
like them to . . . . Demand still outstrips supply, especially when it comes to 
quality goods. 
</P>
<P>
"This," he added, "is explained in a large measure not only by the inertia of 
the past but also by the novelty of problems and the real difficulties of 
organizing life in a new way." 
</P>
<P>
Letters to officials have revealed Soviet concerns about how perestroika would 
affect individuals in the society where everyone is guaranteed a job and the 
state subsidizes everything from bread to apartments. 
</P>
<P>
In his address, Gorbachev warned that perestroika would mean greater individual 
responsibility. He said the changes would include more reliance on "the 
pay-your-own-way system . . . and a broadened scope for initiatives and social 
enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Have to Get in the Mood' 
</P>
<P>
"We all have to get into the mood for such work," he added. 
</P>
<P>
On the topic of international relations, Gorbachev claimed that the Soviet 
Union, acting "in the spirit of the new political thinking," was largely 
responsible for the thaw in the Cold War between East and West. The Soviets 
have learned to listen to the positions of other countries while still "abiding 
by our own principles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the shadows of the past are present in world politics," the Soviet 
leader added. "But they are fading already. A new vision of the world is being 
established." 
</P>
<P>
On other subjects, Gorbachev referred briefly to the nationalist unrest that 
has torn parts of the Soviet Union. At least 31 people were killed in November 
in ethnic violence in the southwestern republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
"We are proceeding to another important phase of political reform, which will 
aim to harmonize inter-ethnic relations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also spoke of the Dec. 7 earthquake in Armenia, which the Soviet Union has 
said claimed tens of thousands of lives. 
</P>
<P>
"The end of the year was darkened by anguish," he said. "Our misfortune has 
evoked warmth, sympathy and response around the world."

GORBACHEV AND REAGAN EXCHANGE HOLIDAY GREETINGS

<P>
For the second consecutive year, President Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev exchanged New Year's greetings for the Soviet and American people, 
each saluting the sharp improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations during 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange of videotaped messages, each about five minutes long, for 
broadcast on Soviet and American television, reflected the new ease with which 
Reagan, who took office as perhaps the most anti-Communist leader in recent 
U.S. history, has been dealing with the Soviet Union in general and Gorbachev 
in particular. 
</P>
<P>
As if recognizing this, Gorbachev said in his remarks -- a text of which was 
made public Saturday by the White House -- that "Americans seem to be 
rediscovering the Soviet Union -- and we are rediscovering America. Fears and 
suspicion are gradually giving way to trust and feelings of mutual liking. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was rich in momentous events. It also brought many good changes in 
relations between our peoples and countries," the Soviet leader added. "Today 
they are more dynamic and more humane. We have become closer, and we have come 
to know each other better." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Reagan told the Soviet people, "I am confident that relations 
between our two countries will continue on the positive course they have 
followed in the year just ending. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite our disagreements, we have been able to find some common ground," he 
added, singling out human rights, arms control, regional problems and 
U.S.-Soviet relations in general. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan-Gorbachev exchange was broadcast in full by ABC and NBC. CBS used 
excerpts from both talks on its evening news program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difference From Last Year 
</P>
<P>
In tone and specific content, the speeches by the two leaders reflected the 
positive course in relations, when compared with the addresses each delivered 
one year ago. At that time, Reagan used the Soviet airwaves to gently prod the 
Kremlin on such sensitive issues as human rights and regional disputes, while 
giving a condensed introduction to American society that offered the Soviet 
audience a glimpse of American holiday traditions and a miniature civics 
lesson. 
</P>
<P>
And two years ago, Gorbachev declared that after the failures of the October, 
1986, summit conference in Iceland, superpower relations were too poor to 
justify an exchange of New Year's greetings. So, Reagan's message that year, 
broadcast on the Voice of America, was blotted out by electronic jamming in 
much of the Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's 1989 message was videotaped on Dec. 15 in the White House Map Room, 
before the President flew to California for a two-week vacation. 
</P>
<P>
The President said that in human rights, "progress is being made in 
reunification of families, freedom of people to travel as they please, and in 
other areas." He also said that the halt in electronic jamming is a positive 
step. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Solutions Being Found' 
</P>
<P>
"In regional issues, from Afghanistan to the Persian Gulf and southern Africa, 
solutions are being found to conflicts of many years' standing," Reagan said, 
challenging the Soviets to join "in the effort to bring peace, democracy and 
security to Central America" -- a region to which Gorbachev made no reference 
in his speech. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan also challenged the Soviets to go beyond the 500,000-troop cut in 
conventional forces that Gorbachev announced at the United Nations on Dec. 7. 
The troop reduction, Reagan said, is "certainly a step in the right direction 
of correcting the imbalances in the European military situation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Administration Change 
</P>
<P>
Both the American and Soviet presidents, recognizing the change in 
administrations that is about to occur in the United States, predicted that 
President-elect George Bush would bring an element of continuity to the two 
nations' relations. 
</P>
<P>
"We can look ahead with optimism to the future of our relations. This is what 
we talked about with President-elect Bush," Gorbachev said, referring to his 
meeting with Bush in New York on the day of the U.N. speech. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Optimistic Approach 
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address broadcast in the United States, Reagan took a 
slightly less optimistic approach, stating that U.S.-Soviet relations can 
continue to improve, but "we must remain sober in our estimation of our 
negotiating partners and without illusion . . . about their goals and aims." 
</P>
<P>
Whether seeking reduced tensions in relations with the Soviet Union or in the 
Middle East, the Bush Administration will need congressional support and 
"appropriate levels of defense spending," Reagan said, adding, "Trust me, I 
know." 
</P>
<P>
The radio address was delivered from the Palms Spring estate of Walter and 
Leonore Annenberg, with whom the President and Nancy Reagan are spending the 
New Year's holiday, as they have for nearly two decades. The festivities 
included a black-tie New Year's Eve dinner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Policy of Peace Paying Off' 
</P>
<P>
As the New Year arrived, the President declared in the radio speech that "our 
economy is healthy, our defenses are strong and our policy of peace through 
strength is paying off in spades." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's optimism was tempered only by the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 on Dec. 
21. 
</P>
<P>
"Now if, as seems likely, our terrorists have crawled out of their hole to 
threaten American lives, I can promise them this: The pledge we made to seek 
out the truth and punish the guilty is a sacred one which George Bush shares," 
he said.

STATE HIGH COURT TAKES ANTICIPATED TURN TO THE RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP HAGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The widely anticipated turn to the right by the newly aligned California 
Supreme Court emerged in strikingly clear form in a range of decisions issued 
during 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, under a liberal majority led by former Chief Justice Rose 
Elizabeth Bird, business, insurers and law enforcement repeatedly suffered 
defeat. But last year, under a more conservative court led by Chief Justice 
Malcolm M. Lucas, yesterday's losers became today's consistent winners. 
</P>
<P>
The trend was underscored last week in the court's long-awaited ruling on 
wrongful discharge in which the justices limited the rights of workers to sue 
their employers for an unjust dismissal -- a decision with sweeping impact on a 
fast-growing area of employment law. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling followed the justices' far-reaching reversal last August of a 1979 
landmark ruling that had allowed accident victims to bring damage suits against 
the wrongdoer's insurance company for the bad-faith refusal to accept a claim. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uphold Death Sentences 
</P>
<P>
On another front, the court, struggling to reduce a huge backlog of death 
penalty appeals, issued 56 capital rulings in 12 months, upholding death 
sentences 43 times. 
</P>
<P>
In the nine years ending in January, 1987, with the departure of Bird and two 
other justices defeated in the 1986 fall election, the court affirmed the death 
penalty only four times in 68 rulings. 
</P>
<P>
In other notable criminal law decisions last year, the court abandoned a past 
ruling that had restricted the use of improperly obtained confessions, opened 
the way for longer prison terms for repeat offenders and upheld a law aimed at 
curbing sex offenses by prohibiting loitering at public restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the year, the justices showed little inclination to seek societal 
reform through ground-breaking court decisions -- a trademark of the court for 
the nearly three decades that it was under a liberal majority. The new court 
looked for guidance from the U.S. Supreme Court and courts in other states and 
expressed a desire to leave it to the Legislature to make bold changes in state 
law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critics Disturbed 
</P>
<P>
The court's sharp turn disturbs critics who, while expecting some shift toward 
judicial conservatism, had hoped the change would not be so abrupt and 
wide-ranging. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the Lucas court has taken over, we have had a series of decisions which 
operate to deprive individuals of their economic rights while benefiting large 
corporate institutions," said Steven J. Kaplan, a Los Angeles attorney who 
represented the employee who brought the wrongful-dismissal case decided last 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"This court, at a visceral level, is much more sympathetic to the corporate 
world than its predecessor," Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Laurence, director of a newly formed Death Penalty Project of the 
American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, raises concern over the 
record pace of capital case rulings and the court's tendency to uphold death 
verdicts even though a procedural error has occurred at trial. 
</P>
<P>
"I am surprised that the court is not taking a closer look at some of these 
cases," Laurence said. "This court is much more willing to find an error was 
harmless than was the previous court." 
</P>
<P>
But the beneficiaries of the shift on the court welcome what they see as a more 
balanced approach and a greater effort to clarify the law for judges, lawyers 
and litigants. 
</P>
<P>
"This court has a fuller appreciation of what's involved in a criminal 
prosecution and a real-life grasp of how a case moves through the judicial 
system," said state Chief Assistant Atty. Gen. Steve White. 
</P>
<P>
"In both the criminal and civil area of the law, the court is more inclined to 
be sensible about the impact of a ruling on the judicial process," White said. 
"It seems much more interested in supplying guidance to all parties so we can 
avoid error where possible." 
</P>
<P>
In an ironic twist, the court issued several rulings in 1988 that went against 
Gov. George Deukmejian, a leading critic of the Bird court who named the five 
justices to the seven-member court who formed a bloc that set a new 
philosophical course in the law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taken by Surprise 
</P>
<P>
This apparent assertion of independence from the influence by the Republican 
governor took some observers by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
The justices ruled that Deukmejian's nominee for state treasurer, Rep. Daniel 
E. Lungren, could not take office with confirmation by only one house of the 
Legislature; held that a commission made up of Deukmejian appointees could not 
establish a "sub-minimum" wage for employees receiving tips, and twice refused 
to hear a Deukmejian Administration challenge to a 1981 Bird court ruling that 
struck down legislative restrictions on state-funded abortions for low-income 
women. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the results in a broad range of decisions issued during the last 
year signaled a marked change in direction from the old court. 
</P>
<P>
In significant criminal law rulings, the court: 
</P>
<P>
* Upheld three of every four death penalty verdicts it reviewed and, while 
issuing no particularly far-reaching decisions, made clear that it will not 
overturn death sentences because of a procedural error that, realistically, 
could not have affected the outcome of the case. 
</P>
<P>
* Ruled that prosecutors may use improperly obtained confessions to challenge 
the truthfulness of a defendant's testimony at trial. The justices, abandoning 
a 1976 ruling barring any such use of incriminating statements, said that under 
Proposition 8, the 1982 victims' bill-of-rights initiative, state courts now 
are bound by less-restrictive U.S. Supreme Court decisions on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
* Reversed a 1986 ruling by the old court and held that trial judges may review 
a wider range of court records to determine whether convicted felons may be 
sentenced to longer prison terms because of previous commission of a 
residential burglary. 
</P>
<P>
* Held that the state Board of Prison Terms properly rescinded the impending 
parole of "Onion Field" killer Gregory Ulas Powell based on new evidence that 
his release could endanger public safety. The decision overturned a contrary 
ruling by the Bird court in 1986 that had opened the way for the release of the 
convicted murderer of a Los Angeles police officer in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
* Reversing another decision under Bird, held that trial judges need not warn 
jurors that eyewitness identifications of suspected criminals may be unreliable 
and should be viewed with caution. The debate over the reliability of such 
identifications should be left to trial counsel and expert witnesses to argue 
before the jury, the justices said. 
</P>
<P>
* Upheld the constitutionality of a state law making it a crime to loiter near 
a public restroom. The court rejected arguments by civil libertarians that the 
law would encourage discriminatory arrests against homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
* Allowed the prosecution for manslaughter of a Christian Scientist parent 
whose child died after her mother rejected medical assistance in favor of an 
attempt to heal by prayer. Parents, the court said, have no right to exercise 
religious beliefs at the price of a child's life. 
</P>
<P>
In major civil decisions, the court: 
</P>
<P>
* Ruling in the milestone case of Los Angeles executive Daniel D. Foley, held 
that an employee who is fired without good cause, in violation of a company 
promise, can sue his employer only for lost pay and other economic loss. 
</P>
<P>
Awards for emotional distress and punitive damages, which could range into 
hundreds of thousands of dollars, may not be obtained, the justices said. More 
than 1,000 wrongful discharge suits are filed annually in the state. Attorneys 
predicted a sharp drop in such litigation because dismissed workers will have 
less incentive to file suit and attorneys, working on a contingency-fee basis, 
will be less willing to take on cases. 
</P>
<P>
* Overturned a major ruling by the Bird court and held that accident victims 
may not bring suit under state insurance law for the insurer's refusal to 
fairly settle a claim. The court noted that the previous ruling had been widely 
criticized and rejected by most other states that had considered it. In 
California, the justices said, the ruling had produced confusion, inequitable 
results and high litigation costs. 
</P>
<P>
* Turned down a challenge by state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp to the 
$10.1-billion purchase of Getty Oil by Texaco in 1984, ruling that state 
antitrust law cannot be used to attack mergers by corporations. 
</P>
<P>
* Upheld the constitutionality of Proposition 51, the "deep-pockets" 
liability-reform initiative limiting damages for pain and suffering and other 
non-economic injury in civil injury cases. However, the court, limiting the 
immediate impact of the measure, ruled it will not apply to tens of thousands 
of cases that were pending when it was passed by the voters in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
* Gave broad protection to prescription drug makers by holding that injured 
consumers cannot collect damages unless they prove that firms were negligent in 
making the drugs or in failing to warn of their potential dangers. In another 
victory for manufacturers, the court also held that cancer victims are not 
entitled to damages for injury from the drug DES unless they filed suit within 
a year after they first suspected harm from the substance. 
</P>
<P>
* In a case watched closely by religious groups, ruled in a milestone "clergy 
malpractice" suit that church pastors may not be held liable for the suicide of 
a despondent youth to whom they had given spiritual counseling. 
</P>
<P>
* Said that the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church can be sued for fraud 
for allegedly "brainwashing" unknowing recruits and tricking them into joining 
the church. 
</P>
<P>
* Barred a single man from suing for the negligence-related death of his 
live-in girlfriend, ruling that unmarried cohabitants are not entitled to the 
same rights that the law gives married couples to bring such suits.

"It's over," said Howard Kleinberg, the News' editor and an employee for 38 
years. "I think we gave it a good effort." 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't just another newspaper dying. It has a rich and proud history," 
Publisher David Kraslow said. "Our influence far exceeded our circulation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Circulation Declines 
</P>
<P>
The circulation of the crusading newspaper, winner of five Pulitzer Prizes, had 
declined 57% in a little more than two decades to about 48,000. The owner, Cox 
Enterprises Inc. of Atlanta, said it was unable to sell the News and was losing 
about $28,500 a day. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department has said its antitrust division will look at the closing 
and whether Cox made a serious effort to sell the newspaper. But a federal 
judge Friday denied a private coalition's effort to get an injunction against 
the closing. 
</P>
<P>
The only apparent way to give the News a reprieve would be a Justice Department 
injunction. 
</P>
<P>
Cox announced in October that the newspaper would be closed Dec. 31 if it was 
not sold. Under a recent amendment to a 1966 joint operating agreement with the 
Miami Herald, Cox would have become responsible in 1990 for the News' operating 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
But Cox will continue to share in profits of the Herald, a Knight-Ridder 
newspaper with a circulation of more than 400,000, through 2021 even with the 
News closed. Cox will earn an estimated $300 million through the agreement, the 
News reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Affects News Staff 
</P>
<P>
The news staff, which numbered about 105 in recent weeks, is the main staff 
affected by the shutdown, since the business operation is shared with the 
Herald's. 
</P>
<P>
The News was born May 15, 1896, two months before the city was incorporated, as 
the Miami Metropolis. It lost some readers in the 1960s with its early, 
vigorous criticism of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
Even with its employees job-hunting, the News broke several stories in its 
final days and was in the lead in reporting the Justice Department 
investigation and criticism of its own parent company. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a damn good newspaper," said columnist Mort Lucoff, 59, cleaning out 
his desk after 25 years at the newspaper. "It's pretty wrenching. I put a 
quarter-century of life into this newspaper."

BOMB BLAST KILLS 4 AT U.S. HOME OF BRAZILIAN EMBASSY OFFICIAL

A bomb exploded in the garage of a Brazilian Embassy lawyer early Saturday, 
killing her son and three friends who apparently were tinkering with the 
device, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The blast, which occurred at about 3:10 a.m., blew doors and windows out of the 
garage and hurled one of the youths into the driveway of the home rented by 
Vera Machado, the legal counselor for the Brazilian Embassy in Washington, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
They said Machado and her husband, Ronald, were asleep in an upstairs bedroom 
at the time of the blast and were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
One of the dead youths was identified as Gustavo Machado, 15, the couple's son. 
The others were identified as Samir Gafsi, Dov Fischman and Bruno Perrone, all 
either 17 or 18 years old and all college freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
The three older teen-agers were described Saturday as highly intelligent, 
science-oriented 1988 graduates of Bethesda's Walt Whitman High School. One of 
them, Gafsi, showed a recent interest in explosives, according to his 
girlfriend, Sharmi Banik. 
</P>
<P>
"He was telling me about the explosion on the Pan Am jet" that crashed in 
Scotland on Dec. 21 after a bomb went off, Banik said Saturday. She said Gafsi 
recently told her that he and his friends could "do better than that." 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery County Police Sgt. Harry Geehreng said the blast was not caused by 
terrorists and appeared to be an accident. He said there was no indication the 
victims had been drinking or using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
He said the explosion damaged a car in the garage but there was no evidence 
that a bomb had been placed in or under the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is investigating the 
explosion, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials want to know how the device was made as well as "why was the device 
made," Geehreng said. "This device was much more than ordinary fireworks."

A controversial treaty intended to eliminate all trade tariffs between the 
United States and Canada over the next 10 years goes into effect today with the 
exchange of diplomatic notes implementing the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
President Reagan instructed Secretary of State George P. Shultz on Saturday to 
dispatch the message putting the treaty into effect, the White House announced 
here, where Reagan is spending the New Year's holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy White House press secretary Roman Popadiuk said Reagan spoke by 
telephone Saturday morning with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, 
telling him, "Together, our governments have set an example for the world on 
how eliminating trade barriers can benefit all peoples." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. legislation approving the treaty was signed into law Sept. 28. The final 
Canadian action needed to implement the treaty was taken Friday by the Canadian 
Senate.

HIGH COURT SPOILED BID TO SOLVE BISHOP'S MURDER, SALVADORANS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Officials in the Salvadoran government say that the 1980 assassination of 
Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero, which helped spark the nation's civil war and 
caused worldwide outrage, will remain unresolved because of a Supreme Court 
ruling that the testimony of a key witness is not valid. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, handed down Dec. 21, has caused an uproar in El Salvador, 
escalating the already heated presidential campaign rhetoric between the 
Christian Democrats of President Jose Napoleon Duarte and the rightist 
Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena), the main opposition party. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the case is now closed and justice has been mocked," said Roberto 
Giron Flores, who, as attorney general, was investigating the case until he was 
fired Dec. 23 by the Arena-controlled National Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials, who invested much time and effort in the case, were outraged by 
the ruling and are making that displeasure known, but diplomatic and political 
sources say the Americans acknowledge that nothing can be done to revive the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Romero, a charismatic, outspoken opponent of rightist death squads and military 
repression, was killed by a single shot through the heart on March 24, 1980, 
while saying Mass. It was the most publicized killing of thousands carried out 
by the death squads, and Duarte had vowed to punish those responsible. 
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. Ambassador Robert E. White asserted that the killing was ordered by 
Roberto d'Aubuisson, a founder of Arena and currently a legislator in the 
National Assembly. D'Aubuisson has denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1987, Duarte made public testimony given to investigators by Amado 
Garay, identified as the driver of the getaway car in the killing. Garay said 
that he worked for Alvaro Saravia, a cashiered Salvadoran air force captain and 
protege of D'Aubuisson. Garay said that after the killing, Saravia reported on 
the success of the operation to D'Aubuisson. 
</P>
<P>
D'Aubuisson declared at the time that Garay was lying and rejected the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Based on Garay's testimony, after he passed numerous lie-detector tests and 
other elements of his testimony were investigated, the Salvadoran government, 
with U.S. help, asked for Saravia's extradition from Miami, where he was living 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Saravia was arrested in Miami for violating the terms of his visa, and has been 
held since, as the extradition request proceeded. He was to have been 
extradited in early January, according to legal sources. 
</P>
<P>
But the Salvadoran Supreme Court, described by knowledgeable diplomats and 
Christian Democrats as dominated by the far right, ruled Dec. 21 that there 
were no grounds for arresting Saravia if he returned to El Salvador and that 
the extradition request itself was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that delay in presentation of Garay's evidence, after "seven 
years, seven months and 24 days, completely undermines the credibility of his 
testimony" and resulted in no evidence linking Saravia to the killing. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem here is that we have to understand the judicial system has been 
totally dominated by Arena, which blocks the investigation and application of 
justice," said Antonio Morales Erlich, secretary general of the Christian 
Democrats. "I want to say as a lawyer that the witness and evidence presented 
in the Romero case were ample to proceed with an arrest order." 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 23, the assembly, in its last session of the year and with only the 
Arena deputies supporting the move, fired Giron Flores as attorney general, 
alleging "incompetence and immorality," and named Arena sympathizer Roberto 
Garcia Alvarado to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that I was fired for a simple and fundamental reason -- because 
the Romero case was about to be resolved," Giron Flores said. "Saravia was 
about to return and we were going to discover who was responsible. . . . The 
Romero case is now closed, and I was fired so the case could be closed." 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable observers say that Giron Flores is correct, because, by ruling 
that the testimony was too old -- although no Salvadoran law places time limits 
on the validity of testimony -- any new evidence or testimony will be thrown 
out on the same grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"On legal and procedural grounds, the case is dead," said one person familiar 
with the case. 
</P>
<P>
Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary bishop of San Salvador, after a Mass on 
Christmas Day, said, "In the church, we think (Saravia) has valuable 
information on this act which convulsed the country." 
</P>
<P>
Arena's presidential candidate, Alfredo Cristiani, said that Giron Flores was 
fired for "demonstrable reasons showing he was not fit to continue in office," 
and Cristiani accused the Christian Democrats of throwing up a "smoke screen" 
and "politicizing" the matter by trying to link the firing to the Romero case. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation into Romero's killing was being handled by a special 
investigative unit that had received U.S. training. According to two people 
involved in the investigation, Saravia was also to be charged upon his return 
here with the kidnaping and murder in 1985 of Carlos Guerra Campos, a wealthy 
coffee grower. Investigators said that they planned to use the Guerra Campos 
case to force Saravia to give evidence in the Romero case. 
</P>
<P>
"It was to be our checkmate move," one investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators also said that Garay had identified Dr. Hector Antonio Regalado, 
a dentist, as the triggerman in the murder, although they said that there was 
no hard evidence other than Garay's statement linking him to the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Regalado, an expert marksman, was head of security at the Constituent Assembly 
when D'Aubuisson was president of that body in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, two men who worked in the assembly at that time said that 
Regalado ran right-wing death squads from the building.

KHOMEINI REINS IN A HIGH-RANKING COUNCIL

<P>
The Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Saturday stripped some powers from a 
high-ranking council established in February to speed up Iran's decision-making 
process, Tehran Radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
Following criticism from parliamentary deputies and other radicals that 
formation of the 13-member High Council of Expedience was unconstitutional, 
Khomeini declared that it will no longer be allowed to legislate independently 
of the Majlis, or Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The official radio, monitored in Nicosia, said Khomeini, Iran's supreme leader, 
urged a return to constitutional law now that the need for a speedy 
decision-making process has decreased since the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the war 
with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini, who set up the council in February, said it should revert to its 
original role -- settling disputes between Parliament and the Council of 
Guardians, a panel of clergyman empowered to block laws they consider 
un-Islamic. 
</P>
<P>
"No problem is (now) so urgent as to be debated directly in that council 
without being debated in the Majlis and being supervised by the Council of 
Guardians," Tehran Radio quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The new decree takes effect Jan. 21. 
</P>
<P>
The High Council of Expedience was founded to stop ideological arguments about 
the limits of government power from blocking important legislation. It was also 
authorized to issue decrees on urgent matters.

The youth leader of the main Sikh political party in Punjab was shot to death 
Saturday in an ambush by suspected Sikh extremists, police said.

Malkiat Singh, president of the youth wing of the Unified Akali Dal, was 
attacked as he drove toward Ludhiana, a central Punjab town that has been a 
focus of separatist violence.

Punjab Gov. Siddhartha Shankar Ray issued figures showing the 1988 death toll 
in a violent Sikh campaign for a separate homeland in Punjab was more than 50% 
higher than in 1987 and four times the 1986 toll.

'UNWANTED CHILD' BEQUEATHS $200,000 TO SAN DIEGO PLANNED PARENTHOOD UNIT

Mark Salo, the head of Planned Parenthood here, remembers well how he met 
Edward John O'Toole more than a decade ago when the frail man walked into his 
office dressed in bold plaids and a baseball cap -- and clutching an airline 
bag. Salo politely asked if he could be of any help to the old man. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be the other way around. O'Toole opened his Pan Am flight bag, 
and Salo found himself staring at a bundle of bonds -- $50,000 worth. "I want 
Planned Parenthood to have this money," O'Toole said. 
</P>
<P>
And so began a strange, 11-year acquaintanceship between Salo and the 
mysterious visitor, who died recently at the age of 91 and left the Planned 
Parenthood affiliate his life's fortune of nearly $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me that he had been an unwanted child who had been left by his 
mother," Salo said. "He never went into details, but it seemed to bother him 
terribly that he had been abandoned. He didn't want that to happen to any other 
child." 
</P>
<P>
At O'Toole's request, Salo said, the money will be used for education programs 
that stress family planning and services such as prenatal care, birth control, 
sterilization and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. O'Toole was perfectly lucid," Salo said. "He said things in a 
straightforward way, and told us that this is what he wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
The bequest followed an agreement reached by the two men at the first meeting 
on July 7, 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Salo hesitated in accepting the initial gift of bonds, suggesting that O'Toole 
instead put the money in a trust that would pay him interest. Then, if O'Toole 
still wanted Planned Parenthood to have his fortune, Salo told him, the 
organization would graciously accept it upon his death. O'Toole then created a 
trust fund with $70,000 in bonds and a life insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
Salo never did learn much about the enigmatic O'Toole, who never married and 
had no children. The two men rarely met, and during the last year Salo had 
heard nothing from him. 
</P>
<P>
"He came into my office maybe a total of six or seven times," Salo said. "He 
never wanted anything back. I would say, 'Hello, Mr. O'Toole, how are you 
today?' There was some small talk, and then he left. He was a nice old man." 
</P>
<P>
"In all the time I knew him, I think we spent less than three hours together," 
Salo said. "He never wanted to take up much of my time." 
</P>
<P>
In early December, Salo received a note from San Diego Trust &amp; Savings. 
Edward O'Toole had died Nov. 15, 1988, the note said, and Planned Parenthood 
was the sole beneficiary of his trust. Bank officials say the account is worth 
nearly $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame that we don't know more about this man," Salo said. "All I know 
is that he had a very unhappy childhood. He wanted people to really think about 
having children."

A California man alleged to be a major supplier of cocaine to local casino 
employees has been arrested by narcotics agents. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the arrest of Myron C. Thompson, 27, of Stockton, in a Reno 
casino climaxed a one-year undercover investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who lists his occupation as self-employed, was being held in Washoe 
County Jail in lieu of $250,315 bail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charges Listed 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested for investigation of conspiracy, trafficking in cocaine and 
possession for the sale of cocaine. He also was held for investigation of 
passing a bad check. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Thompson operated a Reno automobile body shop at one time, but 
was forced to close down by state officials because of undisclosed violations. 
</P>
<P>
They said he made regular trips to Reno after moving to Stockton.

A Boston man charged with stealing a wedding limousine tried to escape from 
custody using a gun made of soap, but he was foiled by a deputy sheriff, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Callahan, 35, was being taken from a holding cell in the basement of 
Dorchester District Court on Friday when he pulled the bogus gun, officers 
said. Deputy Frederick Pollini disarmed him with a karate chop. 
</P>
<P>
Callahan faces new charges in the escape attempt. He already is charged with 
robbing a tailor shop Dec. 17, then stealing a limousine carrying a bride and 
three members of the bridal party. He left the four in front of the church.

TRAINS KILL 4, INCLUDING DAREDEVIL PLAYING 'CHICKEN'

Four people, including a woman on her way to work and a young man playing 
"chicken" with friends, were killed by trains in Southern California, two of 
them in Los Angeles County, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In the first incident, at 7 p.m. Friday, Lorenzo Ruelas, 35, of Oxnard was 
killed when he was hit by an Amtrak passenger train traveling 70 m.p.h. outside 
Oxnard, Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Carl Schoenberger said. It has not been 
determined why Ruelas was walking on the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours later Shawn James Schultz, 21, of Escondido was playing the daredevil 
game "chicken" with friends when he put his head on the tracks and was struck 
and killed by a southbound Amtrak train in Oceanside, Officer Lori Conway said. 
</P>
<P>
The Amtrak train bound for San Diego from Los Angeles was traveling about 30 
m.p.h. to 40 m.p.h. as it moved through the city about 40 miles north of San 
Diego, said Police Sgt. Richard Derouen. 
</P>
<P>
The friends did nothing as the engine ran over Shultz because "the object of 
the game is to see how long you can stay down," Derouen explained. 
</P>
<P>
At 3 a.m. Saturday a heavily tattooed man lying on railroad tracks in Sun 
Valley was run over by a freight train and killed, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The train's crew told officers they saw the man as the locomotive approached 
but were unable to stop in time, Sgt. William Meier said. The victim, who was 
carrying no identification papers, had not been identified by late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
At 6 a.m. Saturday, a woman walking to work was struck and killed by a freight 
train as she stumbled and fell across tracks in El Monte, Sgt. Steve Schuster 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Louise Johnson, 30, of Temple City was pronounced dead at the scene, 
Schuster said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was carrying a small bag containing her lunch when she stumbled while 
walking across a triple-track area. She was hit when she reached to pick up the 
contents of the bag, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was still dark at the time," Schuster said. He speculated that she 
misjudged the speed of the train.

OREGON TRIES TO BLOCK DEFENSE ACCESS TO ECCLESIA YOUTHS

Oregon's Justice Department has entered the legal fight over whether defense 
attorneys in the upcoming manslaughter trial of four Ecclesia Athletic Assn. 
members should be allowed to talk to children taken from the group by the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
State Appellate Division attorneys filed a request Friday that the Oregon 
Supreme Court block a Dec. 7 order by Clackamas County Judge John Lowe giving 
defense attorneys access to children taken from the group's rural Oregon camp. 
</P>
<P>
Four adult Ecclesia members face trial Feb. 6 in Clackamas County in the Oct. 
14 beating death of Dayna Broussard, the 8-year-old daughter of the Los 
Angeles-based group's founder, Eldridge Broussard Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys for Willie Chambers, 35; Brian Brinson, 30; Frederick 
Doolittle, 28, and Constance Jackson, 37, have sought to interview some of the 
53 children taken into state protective custody at the group's farmhouse near 
Sandy, east of Portland, hours after the girl's death. 
</P>
<P>
The group originally organized the farm near Sandy as an athletic training 
center to train inner-city youths from Los Angeles. However, state officials 
have alleged that the children were subject to ritualistic abuse, some beaten 
hundreds of times while the others were forced to keep count. 
</P>
<P>
The state attorneys were in a race with the clock in trying to block interviews 
with the children as Clackamas County prosecutors have been ordered to appear 
in Circuit Court next Tuesday to show why they should not be held in contempt 
of court for failing to produce the children. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys Wednesday were granted their request for the order after 
attempts to set up interviews with the children were stalled while prosecutors 
waited to see if the Justice Department would review the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Linder, solicitor general for the state Justice Department, said the 
Supreme Court previously has ruled against trial court judges in criminal 
proceedings ordering the Children's Services Division to produce children in 
its custody for defense interviews or parents to produce children for the same 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
The question still undecided by the court is whether such judges can order 
prosecutors to produce a child for interviews when the child is in state 
custody, as in the Ecclesia case.

The Arab League said Saturday that the return of Egypt to the Arab fold is 
imminent, giving new hope to Arabs at the start of the New Year.

<P>
The league's secretary general, Chedli Klibi, said the cease-fire in the 
Iran-Iraq War, progress on the Palestinian question and rapprochement between 
North African states are other reasons for optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"New avenues of hope now lie open before our nation . . . with the imminent 
return of Egypt into the fold and her resumption of her great mission within 
the Arab family," he said in a New Year message to Arabs.

An unidentified 53-year-old Los Angeles man was shot and killed by police 
Saturday after he stabbed an officer with a screwdriver after a disturbance on 
an RTD bus, authorities said.

Two Los Angeles police officers approached the bus at Vermont Avenue and 8th 
Street about 4 p.m. after receiving reports that a screwdriver-wielding man was 
causing problems on the bus, Lt. William Lewis said. When the suspect got off 
the bus and stabbed Officer Michael Grosso, 31, in the shoulder, then tried to 
stab another officer, Grosso shot him in the chest, Lewis said.

PROF. T. BLAISDELL; HELPED PLAN RECOVERY OF POSTWAR EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL J. YBARRA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas C. Blaisdell Jr., whose half-century of public service and scholarship 
included a prominent role in planning the reconstruction of postwar Europe, 
died Tuesday. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
Blaisdell was a distinguished professor of political science at UC Berkeley who 
continued teaching long after assuming emeritus status in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
After a long career in public service starting in the New Deal era and 
culminating in his leadership in helping plan European recovery after World War 
II, Blaisdell joined the UC Berkeley faculty in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
Active in publishing and lecturing well into retirement, Blaisdell taught 
freshman seminars in political science and international relations as recently 
as last year. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1895 in Pittsburgh, Pa., Blaisdell graduated from Pennsylvania State 
College in 1916. He earned a master's degree in social history at Columbia 
University in 1922 and his doctorate there in 1932. He taught at Columbia from 
1925 to 1932. 
</P>
<P>
In 1933, Blaisdell went to Washington to join Franklin D. Roosevelt's "brain 
trust" in the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. Over the next two 
decades, he held a number of federal positions, working first on helping the 
nation recover from the Depression and then on European postwar reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
Blaisdell was assistant secretary of commerce during the Administration of 
President Harry S. Truman. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was modest about his role in postwar European recovery, colleagues 
have called him one of the principal architects of the Marshall Plan, 
proclaimed in 1947 by Secretary of State George C. Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
A widely published author, Blaisdell's best known work was "The American 
Presidency in Political Cartoons." Written with Peter Selz, a Berkeley art 
history professor, the 1976 book received wide acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
No services have been set. 
</P>
<P>
The family asked that donations be sent to the Fund for Cal in the Capital, the 
Young Musicians Program, both at UC Berkeley, or the Harry S. Truman Institute 
in Independence, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
Blaisdell is survived by a son, Thomas; a brother, William; two grandchildren 
and two great-grandchildren.

SOVIET DISSIDENT YULI DANIEL; IMPRISONED FOR PUBLISHING ABROAD

<P>
Yuli Daniel, a satirist and poet whose 1966 trial with Andrei Sinyavsky was a 
worldwide sensation and marked the beginning of a long crackdown on dissidents, 
died at his home Friday, his former wife said. 
</P>
<P>
Larisa Bogoraz, a veteran of the Soviet dissident movement who was Daniel's 
wife when he was sentenced to five years in prison and labor camp, said he died 
of a stroke. Daniel was 63 and had been in ill health for years. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel's most famous work, "This is Moscow Calling," satirically called for a 
"Public Murder Day," in which Soviets over the age of 16 would be allowed to 
kill someone as long as it was not a policeman or a public transport worker. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Published Under Glasnost 
</P>
<P>
Under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or greater 
openness, some of Daniel's works written in prison camp were published in 
Moscow in July as he lay in a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel and Sinyavsky, conscious of the ostracism of Nobel Prize-winning author 
Boris Pasternak for publishing his novel "Doctor Zhivago" abroad, used the 
pseudonyms Nikolai Arzhak and Abram Terts, respectively, to publish their works 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Despite persecution of writers such as Pasternak, Premier Nikita S. 
Khrushchev's years were relatively free for writers, and came to be known as 
"The Thaw." 
</P>
<P>
But Daniel and Sinyavsky were arrested in the autumn of 1965, less than a year 
after Khrushchev was ousted by a group of Kremlin leaders from which Leonid I. 
Brezhnev eventually would emerge as the most powerful. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel received a five-year term in prison and labor camp for illegally 
publishing his works abroad, and Sinyavsky was sentenced to seven years. It was 
the first time that criminal charges were brought against Soviet intellectuals 
for literary criticism of the Soviet system. 
</P>
<P>
Dissidents, KGB agents and foreign correspondents huddled outside the Moscow 
courtroom where they were tried, and rushed to get word of the proceedings when 
the defendants' wives would come out during breaks. News of the trial was 
broadcast back into the Soviet Union by foreign radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin followed their trial with a long and determined crackdown on 
dissidents and unofficial publications, but during the late 1960s unofficial 
publications and the number of dissidents grew nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ended Dissident Activities 
</P>
<P>
Daniel lived and worked in Kaluga and Moscow after he finished his prison term, 
but did not take part in further dissident activities. Sinyavsky emigrated to 
Paris after serving his term. 
</P>
<P>
The publication Ogonyok, in printing Daniel's prison camp poetry, called him a 
"war veteran and man of difficult fate." 
</P>
<P>
Included in the poems published in July was "The Ring," in which Daniel 
appeared to be describing his trial as a boxing match. 
</P>
<P>
Bogoraz said that Daniel was survived by his wife, Irina Uvarova, a son and 
grandson.

THE 4 FRESHMEN; 
</P>
<P>
VISION OF COALITION COMES UNRAVELED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One year ago, their election began the most complete overhaul of the San Diego 
City Council in a decade. Four educated, ambitious, politically savvy men -- 
they were the first group to take their seats together as newcomers since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
They were instantly nicknamed The Four Freshmen, and they almost as quickly 
predicted that they could become a force on the nine-member council. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going into office as a coalition of sorts," District 8 Councilman Bob 
Filner said the day after he was elected with the 2nd District's Ron Roberts, 
4th District's Wes Pratt and 6th District's Bruce Henderson. "People may wonder 
how or where the mayor and the current council members might get votes from us. 
But, on the other hand, with four of us coming in, we only need to pick up one 
vote to do what we want to." 
</P>
<P>
As Filner could best attest, it has not worked out that way. The freshmen's 
political differences soon dashed any semblance of a coalition forged in the 
heat of the campaign, and their fortunes have followed divergent paths. 
</P>
<P>
But each began to carve a niche for himself as the council fought and lost the 
battle to rein in growth, confirmed a new police chief, selected a site for a 
new Civic Center, grappled with an expensive sewage problem, authorized yet 
another study of how to relocate the airport, endorsed Mayor Maureen O'Connor's 
Soviet arts festival and raised hotel taxes to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a look, in district order, at the Four Freshmen's first two semesters. 
</P>
<P>
The day after he was elected, District 2 Councilman, Ron Roberts promised to 
"hit the ground running." These days, it is said around City Hall, Roberts is 
running -- for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Friend to All Issues 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, whose district stretches from Point Loma to Mission Hills, greets 
returning warships, fires starter's pistols at track meets, cuts ribbons, 
accepts awards and gives speeches. His energy is so boundless, his presence so 
ubiquitous, his name in the news so often, that it is difficult to remember he 
has been on council only a year. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts has yet to meet an issue he doesn't like. Whether it is growth 
management, safety and noise at Lindbergh Field or sewage treatment and water 
reclamation, Roberts has studied it, and he has a plan for improving it. 
</P>
<P>
More than any of the four new council members -- perhaps more than any other 
council member except Gloria McColl -- Roberts has nimbly stepped into the 
power vacuum created by the city's weak mayor form of government and O'Connor's 
hands-off leadership style. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mixed Reviews 
</P>
<P>
At year's end, he had positioned himself in a tenuous coalition of five 
moderate-to-conservative Republicans that could dominate the nine-member 
council if its members can overcome longstanding differences among them. At the 
same time, he remains close to O'Connor, who endorsed only him among the eight 
candidates in the 1987 election. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Roberts' adventures have backfired. An attempt to remove the city's 
highly successful Motion Picture and Television Bureau from the Chamber of 
Commerce led to an embarrassing defeat and ill will from the chamber. "I would 
do that differently if I had it all to do over again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Slow-growth activists, who had high hopes for Roberts when O'Connor endorsed 
him as "someone who knows how to say 'no' to developers," now consider him the 
architect of some of Proposition H's worst features. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron Roberts talks like Mr. Rogers but votes like Attila the Hun," was a 
standard campaign stump line from Citizens for Limited Growth's Peter Navarro. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts deftly handles speculation about his ambition. "The things I'm doing 
are because that's how I interpret the job of being on the council. If there 
is, at a later date, a reward in citizens 
</P>
<P>
saying, 'We're willing to to let you step up to a higher office,' that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, who this month began a new four-year term in office, has heard the 
whispers about Roberts' ambition but is unconcerned. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to tell you, I think they're all running for mayor. Everybody's running 
for mayor. Secretly, and I'll talk generically, any council member who serves 
as a council member has kind of a little, secret desire to one day be mayor," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"My philosophy is 'good government is good politics,' " she added, "I work 
hard, I try to serve the community well. It's their choice. What will be will 
be." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High-Profile Concerns 
</P>
<P>
Blessed with intelligence, drive and an All-American, good-guy personality, 
Roberts has benefited from the fact that the issues he is best able to tackle 
are among the city's most high-profile concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts' district includes Lindbergh Field, so he is a natural to work on the 
pressing matters of noise and safety at the airport -- issues watched closely 
throughout the region. Point Loma is home to the city's only sewage treatment 
plant, so Roberts has become outspoken on the city's need for a $1.5-billion 
upgrading of its sewer-treatment system, and, more specifically, on the need to 
develop water reclamation technology. 
</P>
<P>
As an architect and former chairman of the Planning Commission, Roberts was 
installed as chairman of the committee that wrote Proposition H, the council's 
growth-management plan. He became the leading spokesman for it during the 
unsuccessful election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But Roberts' success is mostly of his own making. He worked with Point Loma 
residents and the Port District to fashion the compromise plan approved this 
month that will limit noise from takeoffs and landings at Lindbergh. He has 
ridden in an airplane cockpit to assess the danger, if any, posed by the Laurel 
Travel Center building at the foot of the airport runway. He is involved in 
discussions with the Navy to reshape the landscape at the foot of Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, Roberts finds time for his district. He has worked to revitalize Ocean 
Beach and is helping Point Loma's planning board devise ways to lessen 
peak-hour traffic, caused largely by sailors, on Catalina Boulevard and 
Rosecrans Street. 
</P>
<P>
"That man is working day and night," said Ann Jackson, chairman of the 
Peninsula Community Planning Board. "I feel very fortunate that he chose to 
leave the architectural profession and try serving the city and the community. 
He's doing a wonderful job." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts points to a new downtown plan, a new waterfront plan, the 
growth-control debate and the airport as his major issues in 1989. He also will 
be heavily involved in the council's redistricting efforts and is rumored to 
want to add a chunk of downtown to his district. 
</P>
<P>
Wes Pratt took office, took one look at the crying needs in his impoverished 
council district and took to the streets of Southeast San Diego. He lectures 
schoolchildren on the evils of drugs, marches to protest gang violence and goes 
door-to-door exhorting homeowners in the battle against crack dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Long before district elections were approved by voters in the November, Pratt, 
the council's lone black member, focused his energy on the concerns of his 
largely minority constituents in the 4th District, which includes Southeast San 
Diego, Encanto, Paradise Hills and most of the California 94 corridor. If that 
meant that his colleagues would grab the limelight, so be it. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided I would simply concentrate on district-related issues and getting 
out into the district," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His record is true to that decision. In his first year, Pratt sought more money 
for social services to AIDS victims, a growing concern of the minority 
community. He championed the losing Charter Review Commission ballot initiative 
for a tough police review board and was critical of the police shooting of 
Tommie Dubose during an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
He was actively involved in the negotiations to sell Southeast's San Diego 
Physicians &amp; Surgeons Hospital, and at year's end was leading the effort to 
have the city's Convention Center named for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the 
slain civil rights leader 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staying Above the Fray 
</P>
<P>
Pratt has developed a reputation for staying above the fray on City Hall's 10th 
floor, where the deal-cutting and alliance-building among council members can 
be fast-paced. That stance has allowed Pratt to acquire some power as a 
somewhat unpredictable swing vote on the nine-member council. It was Pratt, for 
example, who came back from his sickbed to break a 4-4 tie on the size of the 
increase of the city's hotel room tax. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't ask to be in that position," he said. "It's just the way I conduct 
myself in the City Council is to be pretty straightforward and not ally myself 
with one faction or another." 
</P>
<P>
Herb Cawthorne, executive director of the San Diego Urban League, believes 
Pratt "has done an exceptional job. He's surprised a lot of people with his 
ability to grasp the larger issues. He has a tremendous amount of pressure on 
him, because his balance makes him the swing factor a lot of times. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, as he matures, he will learn to exercise the power in more 
far-reaching ways," Cawthorne added. 
</P>
<P>
George Stevens, an aide to Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) and Pratt's opponent in 
the council race, praises Pratt for his stand on the police review issue and 
for his responsiveness to neighborhood needs. 
</P>
<P>
But Stevens believes that Pratt should be supporting a committee recommendation 
to include King's full name in the convention center title instead of Pratt's 
proposal of "San Diego King Convention Center." And he believes Pratt should 
have gotten an even larger share of this year's Community Development block 
grant money than the $2 million his district received. 
</P>
<P>
A rare politician who does not feel the need to give extended speeches before 
each vote, the quiet, burly Pratt has earned the respect of colleagues with his 
allegiance to doing what is right. 
</P>
<P>
"Wes Pratts don't come along very often," said Mayor Maureen O'Connor. "He's 
got a rare quality about him." And "99% of the time he's on the side of the 
angels," she added. 
</P>
<P>
"I basically want to be about the business of good government," Pratt said. "I 
will continue to do that. I don't feel I have to wave a big flag. Wes Pratt is 
not going to be here forever. People have to take up the mantle and serve." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Henderson has taken a prominent role in some important citywide and 
district issues. Henderson was the architect of Proposition K, the advisory 
ballot measure calling for a mandatory, citywide program of staggered work 
hours to reduce peak-hour traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Along with several other council members, he has championed an ordinance to 
preserve single-family neighborhoods, which make up a sizable part of his 6th 
District, which includes Pacific Beach, Mission Beach and Clairemont. He led 
the fight to equip the city's police force with two helicopters captured from 
drug runners. One chopper is now operating and the other is being outfitted. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson continues to be the council's maverick on its $1.5-billion sewer 
system upgrade, insisting that the effort is not necessary. He also led 
opposition to a $1.5-million consulting contract to publicize the issue, 
narrowly losing his effort to sharply reduce the program, but managing to pare 
$300,000 from the price tag. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that sizable first-year agenda, Henderson is best known inside City 
Hall for the publicity stunts, his long, sometimes unfocused speeches and his 
class-clown tendency to interrupt colleagues during council sessions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blowup Sharks, Posters 
</P>
<P>
Henderson has filled the council chamber with the ominous background music from 
the film "Jaws" and adorned the room with inflatable sharks to make his point 
that "consultant sharks" are feeding on public tax dollars. He altered a "Jaws" 
poster to show the shark munching a dollar bill. 
</P>
<P>
His "Fly Me" poster focused attention on the helicopters. He handed out a 
commuter survival kit at a press conference to exhort voters to approve 
Proposition K. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson has "a sense of humor, a different way of doing things," said 
O'Connor, who concedes she has at times become exasperated trying to silence 
Henderson at council meetings. "He has fun and doesn't take it personally. . . 
. He does make you laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"He tries to exaggerate to make his point. And, through his exaggerations, he 
makes his points. That's his way of doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson agrees that he's trying "just to have a little fun" during council 
meetings that can stretch eight hours or more. 
</P>
<P>
"The sharks captured the council's attention," he said. "I didn't win, but at 
least I saved the city $300,000." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Admits to 'Fine Line' 
</P>
<P>
But, he acknowledges, "I have to be careful because there's a fine line between 
using them and amusing (council members) and over-using them and irritating 
(council members)." 
</P>
<P>
Behind the clowning, council members agree, is a keen mind and a financial 
acumen that many other council members lack. Henderson has also concentrated on 
his district, focusing on a traffic study of Mission Bay, Pacific Beach and La 
Jolla and closely scrutinizing requests for exemptions from the city's Interim 
Development Ordinance in his neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
He has also maneuvered himself into the chairmanship of the Public Facilities 
and Recreation Committee, where he will have a more direct impact on Mission 
Bay Park. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson was perhaps the council's most outspoken opponent of the 
growth-management plan, though he did vote for it after weeks of negotiation. 
"I didn't like H . . ., " he said of Proposition H. "I was very pleased by the 
voters, that they rejected it." Henderson called the voters' decision "a 
reaffirmation of representative democracy," because it put the future of growth 
management back in the council's hands. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, "I think, has been less of an environmental supporter than we had 
expected," said Barbara Bamberger, the Sierra Club's conservation coordinator. 
"And we didn't expect much." 
</P>
<P>
This has not been Bob Filner's month. 
</P>
<P>
It started Nov. 29 when a coalition of five council members relieved him of 
$1.7 million in Community Development block grant funds that City Manager John 
Lockwood had recommended for his 8th District. The following day, the same 
group turned down O'Connor's suggestion that Filner head a council committee 
and installed Henderson as chairman instead. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, they were at it again, refusing to allow Filner to represent the 
council on the Metropolitan Transit Development Board. 
</P>
<P>
Filner's colleagues say they were trying to teach him a lesson. They say he is 
abrasive, that he takes political and philosophical debate and raises it to the 
level of personal attack. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob tends to personalize it: 'you're evil, you're bad, you're mean, you've 
broken the law, and I don't like you, and I'm going to take my football and go 
home,' " Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, one of the group of moderate-to-conservative Republicans who 
engineered Filner's thrashing, claims he was motivated by Filner's attempt, 
during back-corridor wrangling over committee chairmanships, to put together a 
slate that would have left Roberts without a chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Convenient Target? 
</P>
<P>
Filner remains defiant, claiming that the group he has dubbed "the Gang of 
Five" was motivated by common ideological and political goals, not personal 
ones. As perhaps the council's most liberal member, Filner believes he makes a 
convenient target. 
</P>
<P>
"The defeat of the H and J has emboldened the pro-development forces on the 
council," he said, referring to council members Ron Roberts, Bruce Henderson, 
Judy McCarty, Ed Struiksma and Gloria McColl. "I think that's what is behind 
some of the recent votes with the Gang of Five. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an ideological, partisan effort to make sure I am kept weak," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He does not deny trying to put together a slate of committee chairmen without 
Roberts on it. "Why is my attempting to put together a slate that's helpful to 
me any worse or better than his trying to put together a slate that's 
beneficial to him?," he asked. 
</P>
<P>
The answer is that Roberts had the votes to win and Filner didn't. Votes are 
the bottom line, said Andrea Skorepa, executive director of a San Ysidro social 
service agency and a Filner antagonist who supported his opponent, Mike 
Aguirre, in the most recent election. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, for our community, he hasn't been as effective a representative as he 
could be," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the year, Filner watched helplessly as the council overruled his 
recommendation and gave a publicly run recreation center in his district to 
Skorepa's organization. 
</P>
<P>
The internal conflict has overshadowed Filner's accomplishments in his large, 
meandering district, which stretches from Hillcrest through downtown and 
includes San Ysidro and Otay Mesa. A fanatical worker, he is perhaps the 
council's most cerebral member, who has a tendency to intellectual honesty even 
if his views are not politically popular. He is on leave from San Diego State 
University, where he teaches history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Concerns 
</P>
<P>
Filner was the only council member to oppose placing Charter Commission 
initiatives directly on the ballot without review, arguing that the position 
was an abdication of the council's responsibilities. In recent months, some of 
his colleagues have begun to agree. 
</P>
<P>
Filner guided the Balboa Park Master Plan to adoption, insisting that it call 
for maximizing open space. He has brought capital improvement funds to South 
Bay parks and worked on the revitalization of San Ysidro Boulevard. Last month 
he called for higher taxes to put more police on city streets. 
</P>
<P>
Filner has proven himself one of the council's most ardent slow-growth 
advocates and remains a solid pro-environment vote. He has defended the Sierra 
Club from attempts to oust the organization from its Balboa Park office. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob Filner is one of the few consistent supporters, who has been out there and 
has been aggressively fighting for the preservation of open space and sensitive 
lands," said the Sierra Club's Bamberger. 
</P>
<P>
Filner pledged to soften his tone if it will mean more success for his 
district, which could be vulnerable in next year's redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm willing to look at my own behavior," he said. "If it's hurting me from 
achieving things for my district, that will change." 
</P>
<P>
But he adds: "I'm an outspoken person. I represent a district that has 
historically been powerless. I'm going to continue to (be outspoken). If that 
gets me into trouble, so be it." 
</P>

SUPPORT FOR SHERIFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was quite surprised at how uninformed the L.A. Times was in writing the 
editorial on Sheriff Duffy, ("It's Time to Hear From Sheriff Duffy," Dec. 11). 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Union reported a case where an ex-deputy was cleared by a jury of 
brutality. A victory for the Sheriff's Department. This jury saw through the 
absurdity of this lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
It should be against the law to file frivolous lawsuits. The courts are already 
overburdened. It's a waste of taxpayers' money. These claims of brutality are 
probably being blown out of proportion, never occurred, or cons trying to con 
the county out of money. In fact, I hope that the sheriff's deputies 
countersue. 
</P>
<P>
The Times says that Duffy should speak out. Well, I'm sure that the reason he 
or his designated official won't say anything is that anything they say might 
be detrimental to the cases. He has already won one case, and I'm sure he'll 
win more without saying anything. 
</P>
<P>
The Times wants to consider a civilian review board. A law enforcement 
officer's worst nightmare is to have a civilian, who is not trained in the law 
enforcement procedures, who does not have to deal with the bad side of the 
public, to judge whether the law enforcement officer was right or wrong. All 
The Times has to do is check their stories to see that the Sheriff's Department 
does "police" its own. The media have reported at least three cases, that I 
know of, where sheriff's deputies were fired from the department and/or cases 
taken to the district attorney for criminal charges to be filed. I say no to a 
civilian review board. 
</P>
<P>
In my opinion, the Sheriff's Department is doing a good job. To reiterate what 
I saw on a bumper sticker, "San Diego County Sheriff -- Law Enforcement at its 
Best."

A CHARGED IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An idea recently occurred to me that may be worthy of community support. 
Because San Diego is considering buying out San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, how 
about going ahead and acquiring the Chargers as well? Just ponder the plethora 
of possibilities: 
</P>
<P>
Lighting the stadium would be absolutely free, and Charger fans may be eligible 
to apply for a rebate on ticket prices from the Public Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
As part of incentive clauses for free agents, the city/Chargers could offer 
such bonuses as light bulbs, generators, consulting fees and preferred stock. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, in her spare time, could coach the team. 
</P>
<P>
We could trade Tom Page and Steve Ortmayer for a Tucson utility and a 
substance-abusing linebacker to be named later. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the Russian arts festival, the Chargers might scrimmage with members 
of the Kirov Ballet. Perhaps the San Diego Chicken could hatch out of a giant 
Faberge egg during halftime and do a humorous rendition of Swan Lake. 
</P>
<P>
If all this wouldn't give that mean old ogre of a Howard Allen from Southern 
California Edison fits, I don't know what will. Think about it, San Diego. 
SDG&amp;E and the Chargers . . . what an electric combo! Why, everybody, not 
just the skinheads, could go out and paint the old town red.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT: CRUMBS FOR MIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dec. 18 article ("Breaking Camp") relating to the housing problem of 
migrant farm workers in North San Diego County was indeed upsetting, but not 
surprising. 
</P>
<P>
During my four years as California state director of migrant education, I had 
the opportunity to visit many migrant camps and other farm worker housing 
throughout the state. The impressions leave a lasting dismal memory in my mind 
. . . as well as deep anger that our society can treat one segment of our 
population so callously. 
</P>
<P>
To the farmer, as well as the community, the workers are an implement to be 
used for bringing in the crops, then to be ignored, like machinery or farm 
animals. They are not perceived as human beings. . . . like you and me. 
</P>
<P>
Yet they are very human . . . perhaps most of them are more decent humans than 
many of us. They live in a close-knit family, loyal to each other, with high 
moral values, and of deep religious beliefs. They are a proud people, unwilling 
to take a "handout": welfare or social services for which they have not worked. 
Crime, drug or alcohol abuse is rare in these families. 
</P>
<P>
Housing is always a problem. They stay in a community for only part of a year. 
Thus, permanent housing is out of the question. Rental payment for middle-class 
apartments or houses is well beyond their means. So they are forced to live in 
camps, caves, shacks, trailers, their cars . . . wherever. Consequently, both 
they and their children tend to be of poor health, with little chance to learn 
English and not accepted as part of the community. 
</P>
<P>
During the '60s, over 20 camps were built for the migratory farm workers in the 
central valleys of California. The funds came from the federal government to 
the state, which built the camps cooperatively with the counties, which then 
managed the camps that were built on land donated by farmers. These facilities 
are fairly decent temporary housing, and far better than the alternative. Each 
camp houses about 100 families; and several hundred are turned away each year 
because supply does not meet demand. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, I am on the board of directors of the Coachella Valley Housing 
Coalition. We are a small, nonprofit organization, building farm worker 
housing, both apartments and self-help homes. Our first two projects, built 
with federal and state funds, provided very decent multi-bedroom housing for 
100 families, and we are funded for an additional 140 units. Five hundred 
families applied for the first 50 units. We'll keep building until all families 
are out of the ditches and shacks and filthy camps . . . or until the money 
runs out. 
</P>
<P>
So I read about the solution used in North San Diego County: bulldoze the only 
housing the farm workers have been able to provide for themselves! Assure that 
14,000 workers and their families are homeless. Despite the rationalizations by 
the local officials, this action is the most brutal which has yet come to my 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
I guess Congressman Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) speaks for the majority of the 
folks in that area when he throws the responsibility for finding housing and 
meeting health regulations back on the migrant workers. I wish he could spend a 
few days living under their circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
There are solutions. Let the growers, who need the workers, donate a few acres 
each for camps. At the state level, Proposition 84 specifically provides $10 
million for the construction of migrant farm labor camps. It wouldn't take 
much, in terms of federal or state spending. And, provide something more decent 
than the current proposal down there: a 14-foot plastic unit to house a family 
of four. Unbelievable! Would Congressman Packard move his family into such a 
unit? 
</P>
<P>
Just think! If readers of this letter are compassionate, or if they are 
Republicans who believe the private sector should solve all problems . . . if 
all those readers contributed $10 each; then that money might be sufficient to 
house an awful lot of workers who provide the food on our table, and who live 
worse than any other segment of our population. 
</P>
<P>
But then, who really cares?

LINGUISTS DELVE MANY MILLENIA INTO PAST TO FIND MAN'S MOTHER TONGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If this renegade group of linguists could board a time machine, they probably 
would press the accelerator to the floor -- moving backward through the ages to 
a time before Sanskrit, English, Punjabi or Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Hurtling back to a remote part of the past before people ever learned to farm, 
past the era when humans first used fire to a period 100,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
That is the time they think they will find the critical evidence, the seedlings 
that produced all of the world's languages, something they like to call the 
Mother Tongue of Man. 
</P>
<P>
Such a discovery, this group of mostly Soviet and East European researchers 
believe, would prove what is called the monogenesis of language, the evolution 
of the spoken word from a single tongue. 
</P>
<P>
But while even these scientists think the 100,000-year mark could eventually 
prove to be too deep in the remote past, they have made headway in 
reconstructing hundreds of words they believe were spoken 15,000 to 30,000 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Historical linguist Vitaly Shevoroshkin of the University of Michigan in Ann 
Arbor sees a host of applications for biology and anthropology in the work he 
and his colleagues in the Soviet Union have done. 
</P>
<P>
For one, the evolution of language not only shows "how some words have become 
petrified," by not changing much over time but also how people have migrated 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he laments the work has generated little interest in the West. 
</P>
<P>
To hear Shevoroshkin tell it, only a handful of Americans are interested in 
learning the words spoken by early Homo sapiens sapiens, the prehistoric humans 
whom paleobiologists believe first appeared 100,000 years ago and are the 
direct ancestors of modern people. 
</P>
<P>
Shevoroshkin theorizes that it is possible to pinpoint at least a few original 
words of man, elements from a language that served as the progenitor for all of 
those ever spoken on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to reconstruct the proto-proto-proto language, if you will, the 
Mother Tongue. 
</P>
<P>
"A proto language means a language family like Indo-European. If you say 
proto-proto that's an ancestor of a family, not everybody accepts that idea 
especially people in the West. 
</P>
<P>
"But when you say proto-proto-proto, that's something completely different. 
Perhaps we may not find the mother tongue, the language of the world, maybe we 
can go back only 30,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a big gap between people speaking some type of language 30,000 years 
ago and one spoken 100,000 years ago. That is a very big gap and we don't know 
how to fill it." 
</P>
<P>
As part of his quest, however, Shevoroshkin hopes to find the links that tie 
the world's languages together and link them to the past. 
</P>
<P>
To this end, he is building on the work of Soviet linguists Sergei Starostin, 
Vladislav Marakovic Illic-Svityc and Aaron Dolgopolsky who more than 20 years 
ago tediously reconstructed a language spoken 15,000 years ago they call 
Nostratic, which means "our language." 
</P>
<P>
Shevoroshkin said 1,000 words of Nostratic have been reconstructed by analysis 
of common elements from languages he and other scholars believe grew out of the 
ancient tongue. 
</P>
<P>
Nostratic, they believe, gave rise to the Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, 
Kartvelian, Euralic, Dravidian, Altaic and Eskimo-Aleutian language families. 
Hence, making Nostratic a superfamily of languages, or as Shevoroshkin would 
put it -- a proto-proto language. 
</P>
<P>
His hope is to continue on to the proto-proto-proto stage, if he can find the 
clues that will link him to the remote past. 
</P>
<P>
Language is unique to the human species, Shevoroshkin said, and one of the 
primary characteristics like upright walking and a highly evolved brain that 
set humans apart from their cousin primates, the Great Apes. 
</P>
<P>
He believes by way of a technique called deep reconstruction, he can tap into 
the vocabularies of ancient humans, seeking first those elements that exist in 
every language in the world -- first and second person pronouns and names for 
parts of the body. 
</P>
<P>
Such studies produced one of the startling findings in Nostratic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
By studying the word for "eye" in many languages, Soviet researchers were able 
to surmise what the word was in Nostratic. 
</P>
<P>
"In English, the word is eye. But in German it is auge, very similar. In old 
Russian it is oko and in Nostratic we believe it was huka." 
</P>
<P>
Words for nature also lend themselves to historic analysis, he said, 
emphasizing that because there was no agriculture before 10,000 years ago there 
are no words for domesticated animals other than dog. 
</P>
<P>
Nostratic scholars have been able to trace that noun among others, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But even Shevoroshkin admits this is an arduous task and acknowledges that many 
historical linguists doubt he can delve too deeply into the remote past to find 
a language before Nostratic. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford University linguistic anthropologist Joseph Greenberg, who has 
developed a technique called mass comparisons for analyzing various languages, 
is one who questions how well Shevoroshkin will do. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg, himself interested in the evolution of the various languages of the 
world, prefers not to seek the vocabularies of early humankind but to classify 
Earth's myriad tongues past and present. 
</P>
<P>
His work produced the classification of African languages in the 1950s, the 
groupings generally accepted by linguists today. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg would not call the efforts of Shevoroshkin and his co-investigators 
futile but allowed the exercise could prove tedious. 
</P>
<P>
"There's enough to show that all human languages have a common origin," said 
Greenberg. "I think the really interesting part comes in constructing a family 
tree (of languages)." 
</P>
<P>
But the problem with family trees, Shevoroshkin said, is that it is easy to 
leave out vast groups of languages and never show how one is related to 
another. 
</P>
<P>
"Linguists divide languages into several families such as Uralic, Indo-European 
or Afro-Asiatic, and so on. They usually say they are not related and if they 
are there is no proof. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our intention to find the proof and to go beyond that," Shevoroshkin 
said of his endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
"People in this area usually talk about relationships and that makes little 
sense to me," offered Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
But linguist Merritt Ruhlen, formerly of Stanford, acknowledged recently in the 
journal Science that Shevoroshkin probably is right, that there is an ancient 
link tying the world's languages to a common tongue.

TRYING TIME FOR NEW COURTHOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY, BUILDER BATTLE OVER UNFINISHED VAN NUYS PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At its unveiling in mid-October, it was hailed as one of the finest court 
buildings in the nation, a gleaming glass-and-granite edifice to justice that 
would thrust the San Fernando Valley into the forefront of courthouse design. 
</P>
<P>
But the new $52-million Van Nuys Municipal Courthouse may become the subject of 
litigation unless a multimillion-dollar dispute between the contractor and Los 
Angeles County officials is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, plans had called for Municipal Court personnel to move into the 
plush, 11-story, 23-court building, which has its own helipad, 10th-floor 
balcony and state-of-the-art security system, in August. 
</P>
<P>
But 4 months later, the new building is still occupied by construction workers. 
The Municipal Court staff continues to use cramped, makeshift quarters in 
bungalows and trailers and on a floor of the Van Nuys Superior Court building 
next door. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Locked in Negotiations 
</P>
<P>
County officials and Sylmar-based Tutor-Saliba Corp., the contractor, are 
locked in negotiations over claims that each side is responsible for the delays 
and owes the other millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The county on Dec. 1 assessed Tutor-Saliba with late penalties of $3 million 
for failing to have the building ready by Aug. 15, the completion date 
specified in the contract. 
</P>
<P>
The penalties will continue to mount at the rate of $28,000 for each day beyond 
the completion date, said Thomas V. Schriber, the county's chief manager on the 
courthouse project. The total by the end of December was $3.8 million, county 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Such penalties are standard in construction projects and were spelled out in 
the 1985 contract between the county and Tutor-Saliba, the low bidder for the 
project, Schriber said. 
</P>
<P>
The penalties represent the cost to the county of not being able to occupy the 
building, he said. For instance, the county must keep inspectors and project 
managers at the site, lease space elsewhere and pay other costs because the new 
building is not yet open, Schriber said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charges Contested 
</P>
<P>
Tutor-Saliba is contesting the extra charges and accuses the county of causing 
the delays. Tutor-Saliba has filed a claim seeking $1.7 million from the county 
for costs that the company says it has incurred because of the delays. 
</P>
<P>
"On numerous occasions over the past 8 months, this office has advised your 
firm . . . of our serious concern over your firm's lack of progress on 
completing this project," Schriber wrote in a Dec. 1 letter to Tutor-Saliba. 
</P>
<P>
Schriber's letter said work was not complete on courthouse communications and 
elevator systems, nor on mechanical, fire, safety and electrical systems. 
</P>
<P>
It cited the need to replace damaged glass windows, carpets and doors that were 
not inspected for fire safety. 
</P>
<P>
"To our view, the contractor is not performing as well as we would like," said 
Jim Abbott, senior deputy director of the county Facilities Management 
Department. "It's fair to say the quality of the work is fine; it's just that 
it's taking longer to get the work done than we feel it should have. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the courthouse dedication was held," Abbott said, Tutor-Saliba "lost 
their concentration on the job." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
President Blames County 
</P>
<P>
Ronald N. Tutor, Tutor-Saliba's president, scoffed at the charges and accused 
the county of "trying to cover up their own inadequacies" by blaming the 
contractor for delays. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a bunch of nonsense. The job is being finished up in spite of the 
county, not because of it," Tutor said. "The county couldn't build a building 
on time if it tried. 
</P>
<P>
"They know they don't have a prayer in hell of collecting any part" of the 
penalty fees, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Tutor said the project has taken longer than scheduled because the county has 
repeatedly changed specifications, a charge that Abbott denies. Tutor claims 
that the company is entitled to more time to complete the project without late 
penalties because the county has required so many changes. 
</P>
<P>
The delays are inconveniencing Municipal Court personnel in Van Nuys, said 
Aviva K. Bobb, the court's presiding judge. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned by the 6-month delay in occupying the building. We are 
anxious to move in as soon as possible," Bobb said. "The major hardship has 
been that the court is spread all over the block. . . . It causes a lot of 
delays, inefficiencies." 
</P>
<P>
The county has also had to delay plans to renovate the Superior Court building 
and to open Juvenile Courts in bungalows now occupied by Municipal courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The latest tentative plans call for the county to occupy the courthouse in 
mid-January and open it to the public in mid-February, said Peggy Shuttleworth, 
Valley division chief of the Los Angeles Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
The building still has to pass inspection by county employees and state fire 
marshals, Abbott said. It has failed several preliminary fire inspections in 
part because doors were not properly fitted and certified as fire-resistant, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The county is trying to resolve the problems through negotiations with the 
company's top management, Abbott said. If negotiations break down, a lawsuit is 
one of several options that would be considered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If Tutor-Saliba fails to finish the job, Schriber said, the county would 
suspend the firm's contract and have the work done elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The building was formally dedicated Oct. 14 at a ceremony attended by more than 
500 people, including county and court officials, politicians and state Supreme 
Court Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Graffiti-Resistant Interior 
</P>
<P>
The new courthouse features a graffiti-resistant interior; electronic message 
boards, similar to those used at ballparks, to provide information on court 
services, and a specially designed, high-security courtroom featuring a 
bulletproof glass shield to separate spectators from trial participants. The 
court's advanced security system features metal detectors, baggage X-ray 
machines and closed-circuit cameras in public hallways and high-volume 
courtrooms as well as custody areas. 
</P>
<P>
The courthouse was funded by the sale of public bonds and by the Robbins 
Construction Fund, which adds a penalty assessment to traffic and parking 
tickets, said Jerry Orland, head of the project management division of the 
Facilities Management Department. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the first time that Tutor-Saliba has been accused of foot-dragging on 
a county courthouse project. The contractor is building a $19-million Los 
Angeles Municipal Courthouse in Cerritos, which is 6 months behind schedule and 
has engendered similar charges and countercharges, Orland said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the same boat there," Orland said. 
</P>
<P>
Tutor-Saliba is one of the largest general contractors in California, ranking 
70th nationwide in 1987 with $305.3 million in contract awards, according to 
Engineering News-Record, a trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
Tutor-Saliba was awarded an $18.3-million contract by the state Department of 
Transportation to widen a 2-mile stretch of the Ventura Freeway from Valley 
Circle Boulevard to White Oak Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Built Airport Terminal 
</P>
<P>
The company built the $125-million Tom Bradley International Terminal at Los 
Angeles International Airport and is doing $124 million worth of work on the 
Metro Rail subway project in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the items cited in the county's Dec. 1 letter have since been fixed, 
but some problems remain, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent tour of the courthouse, county inspectors pointed out such defects 
as seams and discolorations on carpets, scratches on glass windows and walls 
that needed touch-up paint. Other problems included double doors that must be 
replaced because they were too narrow to lock and wheelchair lifts that failed 
to function during a recent inspection. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, a lot of the changes are just cosmetic stuff and 98% of the 
work is already done," said Mike McNeil, county building inspector. "But when 
you're talking about a $52-million building, that 2% adds up to a lot of little 
things left to be done."

GETTING TO KNOW HIM; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILIARITY WITH CURTIS R. TUCKER JR. MAY BE IN NAME ONLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who is Curtis R. Tucker Jr.? 
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, he was a little-known legislative aide whose father -- Curtis 
R. Tucker, the feisty political patriarch of Inglewood -- was on his way to an 
eighth term as assemblyman from the 50th District. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the younger Tucker is considered the heavy favorite in a special 
election to replace his father, who died of cancer in October. One of the 
state's most powerful politicians, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco), has made it clear that he intends to use his financial and 
political muscle to get Tucker elected. Brown even persuaded Gov. George 
Deukmejian to move up the election from April 11 to Feb. 7, shortening the time 
that other candidates have to raise money and campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's heavy support for Tucker appears to have discouraged several other 
potentially strong candidates from entering the race. The four candidates who 
decided to run against Tucker are considered unlikely to raise enough money to 
compete with Brown's resources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little-Known Candidate 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, many elected officials and others in Inglewood -- the political 
heart of the district -- say they know little about Tucker. The other 
candidates in the race plan to exploit the voters' lack of familiarity with 
Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
"Why hasn't he made himself known?" asks candidate Rod Wright, a veteran 
political consultant. "You don't say, 'My father did this and this, so vote for 
me.' That's not the way it works in America." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker acknowledges that he has kept a low profile in the district. While his 
brother-in-law, John Gibbs, served as the assemblyman's legislative aide in the 
50th District, Tucker worked five years as an aide to mid-Wilshire Assemblyman 
Mike Roos, the Assembly speaker pro tem, before going to work for Assemblywoman 
Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) in the neighboring 49th District eight months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't spent as much time in the (50th) district as I would have liked," 
Tucker said. "But I am known in the district. I know the players." 
</P>
<P>
The heir apparent is 34, a tall, husky, bearded man with glasses. In an 
interview last week, he seemed comfortable with his new role in the limelight. 
He talked freely about the issue that may dominate the abbreviated campaign: 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"If they spend all their time making me an issue, fine," he said. "I'll be 
talking about the real issues: health, crime, airport noise." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Brown's Puppet 
</P>
<P>
Of his critics and rival candidates -- who dismiss him as a puppet of Brown 
whose only credential is his name -- Tucker said: 
</P>
<P>
"They're discounting what I've done for the past six years, who I know, and how 
the real world works. It's sour grapes." 
</P>
<P>
Asserting that most people in politics have a mentor, he added: "They have to 
realize the nature of politics and remember how they got where they are." 
</P>
<P>
Rival candidate Lois Hill-Hale, an Inglewood school board member and former 
aide to state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), said voters will resent 
Brown's "big boss" tactics. She said she has never encountered Tucker during 10 
years of political work in Sacramento and in the 50th District. She said many 
voters do not know that the elder Tucker has died, and she predicted that her 
opponent would exploit that confusion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's going to keep as low a profile as possible and hope that as many 
as people as possible will not find out that his father has passed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker responded: "A lot of people have told me, don't use 'junior' on your 
name, don't change the color of your father's campaign signs, don't use your 
picture on literature. But I'm not trying to fool anybody. I'll always be 
junior." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Follow Father's Agenda 
</P>
<P>
Tucker promises to carry on his father's policies, particularly the careful 
attention to constituents that was the foundation of the assemblyman's 
strength, along with big war chests financed by the health industry and labor. 
Tucker says his legislative office will provide "one-stop" service for 
constituents who need help. He says his differences with his father are largely 
a matter of style, though he considers himself slightly more conservative on 
issues such as crime. 
</P>
<P>
"He favored capital punishment, but I'd be more likely to use it," he said. "I 
believe it's a deterrent, and I believe it's cheaper to throw the switch than 
to pay to keep someone in jail." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's upbringing was steeped in politics. His family was known as "the 
Tucker army" because of their involvement in the career of their father, who 
was appointed Inglewood's first black councilman in 1972, was elected to the 
Assembly two years later and eventually became Health Committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
As the third of five children and the only son of a "very strong" father, 
Tucker says he was restless and resisted his father's pressure to follow a 
rapid career path. Instead, he attended several colleges, finally earning a 
bachelor's degree in history from Cal State Dominguez Hills in 1980. He also 
worked in construction for Pacific Telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to see what was out there," Tucker said. "I liked climbing poles and 
filling manholes. It gave me a different perspective on life. My father didn't 
like it, but he knew I'd eventually get tired of getting wet and dirty." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker, who is married and has two children, entered politics in 1983 as a 
legislative assistant based in Roos' 46th District field office. He acted as a 
liaison with community groups on several projects, according to people who 
worked with him, including a 1986 bill (AB 2700) to toughen penalties on 
apartment owners who did not cooperate with police against drug-dealing 
tenants. He also worked on preparing a 1987 bill (AB 1700) that provided 
incentives to the Los Angeles Unified School District to build multistory 
school buildings rather than tear down neighboring homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives the school board money to build more creatively on less land," Tucker 
said. "It suppresses the need of cutting further into housing stock." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Praised Effort 
</P>
<P>
A legislative staffer who knows Tucker's work praised his efforts on that bill. 
"The school district was happy and the homeowners were happy," the staffer 
said. "I'd give Curtis an 'A' on that one." 
</P>
<P>
The staffer described Tucker as intelligent and capable. But Tucker's work 
sometimes suffered because of absenteeism and a seeming lack of motivation, the 
staffer said: "There was some concern about the quality of his work. . . . I 
think he has the chance to be an above-average assembly member. He has the 
intellect. The question is, does he have the drive, the fire in the belly?" 
</P>
<P>
Tucker responded: "I would say that's one person's opinion. Everyone is not 
going to thrilled with your performance. That goes without saying." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, George Allen, executive director of the Wilshire Chamber of 
Commerce on which Tucker served as Roos' representative, had nothing but 
praise. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an outstanding young man and a hard worker," Allen said. "I highly 
recommend him." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Positioning for Future 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Tucker's early doubts about a future in politics, he said his move 
this year to Assemblywoman Moore's office was calculated to bring him closer to 
the 50th District and position him for the future. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why his father did not hire him as an aide, Tucker said they both 
believed it was better they did not work in the same office for both political 
and personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"The press would have had a field day with it," he said. "One family member 
shouldn't work directly for another." 
</P>
<P>
But the family had a synchronized political agenda, Tucker said. Having turned 
70, Assemblyman Tucker intended his 1988-90 term to be his last; in 1990, the 
plan was for Curtis Jr. to take center stage. 
</P>
<P>
"My father always wanted to be mayor of Inglewood," Tucker said. "He would have 
run for mayor, and I would have run for Assembly in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
But the elder Tucker's death has "speeded up the process tremendously," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's sudden emergence appears to have frustrated the ambitions of potential 
rivals, such as Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent and Councilman Daniel Tabor, 
both of whom have carefully built their careers toward a run for the Assembly. 
Both have said Tucker is not entitled to the seat simply because of his name. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Has He Paid His Dues?' 
</P>
<P>
"The opportunity to select among a qualified field of candidates has been 
eliminated," Tabor said. Alluding to the predominantly black voter base in the 
district, he added: "The real question is, how well does the African-American 
community manage the process of preparing leaders for the future? You tell 
people to go out and pay dues. Has he paid his dues?" 
</P>
<P>
Tucker says he has. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no prerequisite course for being a member of the Assembly," he said. 
"There should be a need to serve and a desire to do a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker hopes to win election Feb. 7 by capturing more than 50% of the vote, 
thus avoiding an April 11 runoff against Mike Davis, the only Republican 
running. Tucker says his campaign plans to spend between $100,000 and $150,000 
on the race and will use an adviser from Brown's Sacramento operation, as well 
as political consultant Parke Skelton, who ran the elder Tucker's last 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
If elected, Tucker said he will follow his father's lead in giving special 
attention to health matters; he hopes to work on a comprehensive package of 
health-care legislation being prepared by Brown that will be named after the 
elder Tucker. He also said that although his father had a mild aversion to 
publicity, especially television, he plans to have a higher profile and use the 
media to report on what he is doing in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's opponents look forward to confronting him on equal footing at debates 
scheduled for next month. They say Tucker's advantage will crumble when voters 
compare the candidates in person. 
</P>
<P>
But Frank Lewis, an Inglewood dentist and longtime Tucker ally, said Tucker 
will live up to his father's legacy. 
</P>
<P>
"He's quiet," Lewis said. "But he knows politics. He's well-versed. People are 
going to be surprised." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker said: "So many people who go into politics have a puffed up sense of 
self-worth. My father never took himself seriously. . . . And I'm still the 
same person who hung off telephone poles. I have no illusions about who I am." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TUCKER ON RECORD 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't spent as much time in the (50th) district as I would have liked, but 
I am known in the district. I know the players." 
</P>
<P>
"(My critics) are discounting what I've done for the past six years, who I 
know, and how the real world works. It's sour grapes." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have told me, don't use 'junior' on your name, don't change 
the color of your father's campaign signs, don't use your picture on 
literature. But I'm not trying to fool anybody. I'll always be junior." 
</P>
<P>
"(My father) favored capital punishment, but I'd be more likely to use it. I 
believe it's a deterrent, and I believe it's cheaper to throw the switch than 
to pay to keep someone in jail." 
</P>
<P>
"My father always wanted to be mayor of Inglewood. He would have run for mayor, 
and I would have run for Assembly in 1990. (But the elder Tucker's death has 
"speeded up the process tremendously."

Officials of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles say they have been 
patient with Antonia Martin, but their patience has run out. 
</P>
<P>
They want the 59-year-old Torrance woman to pack her bags and leave the 
church-owned Torrance house where she has lived for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Martin says she can't afford to move. 
</P>
<P>
So on Jan. 11, the archdiocese will ask a South Bay Municipal Court judge to 
evict her. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paid No Rent 
</P>
<P>
The 600-square-foot wood-frame house at 20535 Anza Blvd. is on the grounds of 
St. James Catholic School, where Antonia's late husband, Angel, was a custodian 
from 1968 until his death in July of 1987. The church allowed the couple and 
their two daughters to live there rent-free while he worked at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Now that he is gone, the church wants Antonia Martin out of the house so it can 
be used for school faculty meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who lives alone, contends that a priest at St. James Catholic Church in 
Redondo Beach, which runs the school, told her in November that she could stay 
until she could afford to move. Now, she said, church officials have gone back 
on their word. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that the church would be more sensitive toward me," said Martin, who 
came with her husband to the South Bay from Cuba in 1967. "I thought they would 
be more considerate." 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who said she has a back ailment that prevents her from working, lives 
on $340-a-month disability checks. She said she can't find a suitable apartment 
that she can afford. 
</P>
<P>
"I would move if I could afford it," she said. "I just can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stay Until June 
</P>
<P>
Martin said she only wants to stay in the home until June, when she turns 60 
and becomes eligible for Social Security benefits. She said she does not know 
how much the payments will be, but she hopes the money will enable her to 
afford an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Neal Blaney director of real estate for the archdiocese, said that if the 
priest -- who is on vacation and could not be reached -- did promise to let 
Martin stay, he did not mean she could stay until June, nearly two years after 
her husband's death. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to give this house to her rent-free forever," he said. 
"Months have gone by, and we have had no indication that she has found or 
intends to find other housing." 
</P>
<P>
The church referred Martin to the Catholic Charities social service agency in 
Long Beach, but Lupe Macker the regional director, said Martin has "not been 
very cooperative." 
</P>
<P>
Macker said Martin was offered several housing options, including group housing 
for the elderly and care and board facilities, but none appealed to her. 
</P>
<P>
"She has not accepted the reality that she has to move," Macker said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said she wants to stay in the Torrance area and the housing offered by 
the agency was too far away or had other drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Todd, a paralegal working for the archdiocese, said the church has offered 
to allow Martin to stay in the home rent-free until Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
"But that is our final offer," he said. "I think the church has been very 
lenient. There is no doubt about it." 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Kirby, a Hermosa Beach attorney who has taken Martin's case, says 
Martin should be allowed to stay in the house until June because church 
officials told Martin "to take all the time you need." 
</P>
<P>
"Besides," Kirby said, "if the school has been without a meeting place for 20 
years, why can't they wait a few more months?" 
</P>
<P>
Kirby said Martin cannot find other housing because of her limited income. 
</P>
<P>
"You try to find an apartment for $340 a month and see how you do," she said. 
Martin has applied to several retirement homes, but they were too expensive or 
had long waiting lists, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said she does not want to seek help or move in with one of her two grown 
daughters, one in Lomita and one in Cerritos, because "they have their own 
lives, and I don't want to burden them." 
</P>
<P>
Both church officials and Martin said they are willing to negotiate. But if 
negotiations fail and the case goes to court, Martin said, "I just hope God's 
grace is with me."

FLORA OF THE VALLEY: COCKLEBURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cockleburs, a common plant in fields and riverbeds, along roadsides and near 
reservoirs, is easily recognized by its prickly burs. 
</P>
<P>
With numerous species, cockleburs are plentiful throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The most frequently seen in California are Xanthium strumarium and Xanthium 
spinosum. Xanthium is a Greek word meaning yellow and was the ancient name of a 
plant used to dye hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Although their origin is unknown, cockleburs are not considered native plants. 
Often pesky, they can develop solid stands on river flood plains covering many 
acres. 
</P>
<P>
Because each bur-like fruit contains two seeds that produces its own generation 
of offspring, cockleburs are difficult to eradicate once started. One of the 
seeds requires much more oxygen than the other and remains dormant for a year 
longer than its twin. Seeds are protected by airtight coats. 
</P>
<P>
Cockleburs are bushy plants that grow to about 3 feet tall. Their inconspicuous 
flowers are greenish and minute. 
</P>
<P>
The hairy, egg-shaped burs are about half-an-inch long and covered with hooked 
prickles that attach themselves to animal fur, manes and tails. 
</P>
<P>
The stems are covered with tiny hairs. The oval to wedge-shaped leaves are 
toothed and 2 to 5 inches long. They are thick in texture and usually are 
three-lobed. 
</P>
<P>
Cockleburs in the seedling stage are poisonous to animals. MAYERENE BARKER

TRAIN KILLS MAN PLAYING 'CHICKEN' IN OCEANSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old Escondido man, who was apparently playing a game of dare with 
friends, was killed Friday night when he put his head on a railroad track and 
was struck by a southbound train passing through Oceanside, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn James Schultz, while playing a game of "chicken" with friends about 11 
p.m., laid down and placed his head on the tracks at Oceanside Boulevard, 
between Cleveland and Myers streets, Sgt. Reggie Grigsby said. 
</P>
<P>
He was struck and killed instantly by the Amtrak train bound for San Diego from 
Los Angeles, police said, adding that the train was traveling 30-40 m.p.h.

JIM MURRAY: 1988: IT WAS VINTAGE YEAR FOR LOSERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hello 1989, I thought you'd never get here. 
</P>
<P>
1988? I thought you'd never leave. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, it was the Year of the Loser. In order, they were: 
</P>
<P>
1. Ben Johnson -- Oh, rare, Ben Johnson. How can anyone lose more devastatingly 
than at the very hour of achieving his life's ambition? When it all falls to 
ashes just after all one's dreams are realized, when the world is at his feet, 
when what you have worked for, strived for, dreamed of all your life has just 
come true -- and someone comes in and tells you it's all been a mistake. Ben 
had just won the Olympic gold medal, set the world record and identified 
himself as the greatest sprinter of all time when suddenly a man in a white lab 
coat turns it to nightmare. When they stripped Jim Thorpe of his medals, he 
became an object of pity. Ben Johnson became an object of scorn. He lost more 
than a medal. He lost respect. Ben makes loser-of-the-year unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
2. Dave Stieb -- Would you classify as a loser a pitcher who lost a no-hitter 
with two-out in the bottom on the ninth to a bad-hop single through the 
infield? OK, how about a pitcher who lost two no-hitters in a row that way? 
That, my friends, is major-league losing. Just a twist here and you're looking 
at the second guy in major-league history to pitch back-to-back no- hitters. 
You are looking at Johnny Vander Meer II. You are looking at a guy who will 
become the answer to a trivia question through 2000 A.D. Alas! The ball hopped. 
</P>
<P>
3. Pat Dye -- How do you become a loser-of-the-year when you have the ball on 
your opponents' 13-yard line, 3 points behind, with 4 seconds left to play? 
Right! You kick a field goal. A losers' play. You go for the tie. You strike 
your colors, fold your hand, cry uncle. It's what Auburn coach Pat Dye did in 
last year's Sugar Bowl against Syracuse. Whatever happened to "Winning isn't 
everything, it's the only thing?" Whatever became of Fight, fight, fight? 
Stonewall Jackson would never understand. Neither would George Gipp. Woody 
Hayes would hit somebody. 
</P>
<P>
4. Davey Johnson -- How would you like to be in Game 7 of the playoff series 
for the National League pennant and have a pitcher on your staff who is known 
as "Dr.K," who has struck out more than 1,000 batters, won 18 games in the 
season and is only 23 years old. He is on the bench with 3 days rest. The 
opposition is starting its best pitcher who has had only 3 days rest and has 
already pitched 3 times in the series. Nevertheless, Manager Davey Johnson 
doesn't start Dwight Gooden in the most important game of the season. The Mets 
manager starts Ron Darling with predictable results. He doesn't save Gooden 
anyway. Dwight gets in the game with the score 6-0 and the pennant gone. In the 
other dugout, Manager Tom Lasorda plays the ace -- Orel Hershiser. Davey 
Johnson makes loser-of-the-year by acclamation, the pinup boy for every 
second-guesser east of the Tehachapis. 
</P>
<P>
5. Dennis Eckersley -- How would you like to be the best relief pitcher in the 
American League with a league-leading 45 saves, an ERA of 2.35, a record of 
having only walked 11 batsmen all year and a record of having finished 53 of 
the 60 games you appeared -- and in the ninth inning of the first World Series 
game, you are breezing along with a 4-3 lead and have just retired the first 
two batters to face you, one by strikeout, the other by weak grounder. You need 
an out to, maybe, just clinch the whole World Series when up comes this batter 
who has hit just .196 all year with no great reputation for power (he has hit 2 
home runs and has 17 runs-batted-in). He strikes out a lot (once every 4 1/2 
times at-bat). 
</P>
<P>
This is not Babe Ruth but you, you, unaccountably, begin to pitch to him as if 
he were. The next thing you know, you have just walked Mike Davis and put the 
tying run on first base. But, never mind. Get a load of the guy who's coming up 
to pinch-hit. He looks like a guy leaving a train wreck. He can hardly walk. He 
winces just lifting the bat. He's only going to tap the ball into play some 
place and hope for a big break. This is the only at-bat he'll get in the whole 
Series and he doesn't look as if he can handle even this. You get two quick 
strikes on this refugee from the disabled list and this looks like a mismatch. 
The chances are good he couldn't get around on a medium-good fastball if you 
sent it up there with stamps on it. So, for some reasons best known to the 
gremlins of baseball, you decide to try what you call a "backdoor slider" on 
him. Now, the slider is the pitch the late Fresco Thompson used to say was 
going to put * lot of .270 hitters in the Hall of Fame. It was, he said, the 
pitch that let Maris break Babe Ruth's home-run record. 
</P>
<P>
It has been variously described as the "nickel curve," the "downtown pitch," 
and, when it doesn't work, as "the slop slider." This one you let go of is all 
three. At the bat, Kirk Gibson can't believe his good luck. His eyes get big, 
his groin doesn't hurt any more. He dreams of pitches like this. As Joe 
Garagiola would say, "you couldn't order a better one from room service." 
Gibson swings. Not hard, just about like a guy lofting a 9-iron to a trapped 
green. It is out of the lot the minute it leaves the bat. It is one of the 
historic home runs of baseball history. It wins, to all intents and purposes, 
the World Series. It is a pitch Dennis Eckersley probably wanted to run after 
and retrieve the minute he let go of it. To call time. Pray for an earthquake. 
Anything to get that ball back in his glove before it goes into the right-field 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
That pitch is one of the great losers of 1988. It is a game-loser and a 
Series-loser. They don't get any worse than that.

CHICAGO ROLLS PAST PHILADELPHIA AS FOG BLANKETS SOLDIER FIELD 
</P>

CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You just couldn't see the Chicago Bears beating the Philadelphia Eagles 
Saturday in their National Football Conference semifinal playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, the Bears won, 20-12. You just couldn't see it. 
</P>
<P>
Or much of anything else on a day when fog, rolling in off Lake Michigan, 
severely hampered visibility at Soldier Field. Veterans in the press box said 
it was the worst they'd seen, or rather not seen, at this stadium in half a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Who knows? When they review the film, they may yet discover Philadelphia won. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Ditka vs. Buddy Ryan? This was more like Sherlock Holmes vs. Professor 
Moriarty. 
</P>
<P>
But in the end, as is often the case at Soldier Field, blue sky or no sky, the 
game came down to the Bear defensive unit. Ranked No. 2 in the National 
Football League, it lived up to its ranking, intercepting 3 Randall Cunningham 
passes and holding the Eagles to 52 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
And the Eagles helped out by constantly breaking down offensively. Penalties, 
dropped passes, missed opportunities -- Philadelphia was guilty of all that as 
it failed to reach the end zone despite the fact that Cunningham completed 27 
of 54 passes for 407 yards. 
</P>
<P>
At times, the players couldn't even see the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"What I could see was about 20 yards downfield," Cunningham said. "If you take 
your 10-yard dropback, you could see only about 15 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to change to our short routes. They knew that. But let me say first, we 
beat ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
And much to the delight of the crowd of 65,534. Or at least that portion of the 
crowd that could see what was going on. Pity the poor fan who shelled out $30 
to sit in a seat and watch the blurry figures fade in and out of the mist. Kind 
of like paying for a big fight to be beamed into your living room only to have 
the picture go out on your television set. 
</P>
<P>
In the press box, the media were reduced to listening to reports from the field 
or watching monitors. 
</P>
<P>
How often do you hear the public address announcer say, "There's word of a flag 
on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Never mind instant replay. Saturday's game may begin a debate over the use of 
radar. 
</P>
<P>
It was a great day for getting away with holding, 12 men on the field or the 
hidden-ball trick. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been a great afternoon for legendary Bear runner Red Grange, 
known as the Galloping Ghost. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the home-field advantage. The fans can't cheer for what they can 
only hear. 
</P>
<P>
Strangely enough, the day began with a bright blue sky and the temperature in 
the 30s. 
</P>
<P>
It was under those conditions that the Bears took an early lead. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Mike Tomczak, starting his first NFL playoff game, made his first 
completion a memorable one, connecting with Dennis McKinnon on a 64-yard 
touchdown pass play in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a problem with the coverage, and I think we might have had the right 
play called," Tomczak said. (Receiver Glen) Kozlowski cut underneath, and I 
think the corner (Roynell Young) was starting to move inside, apparently 
thinking Dennis was also going inside. Dennis just headed upfield and had the 
corner beat. It was a great fake on Dennis' part." 
</P>
<P>
It also helped that safety Andre Waters, the only man with a shot at McKinnon, 
fell down. 
</P>
<P>
He got up after McKinnon had caught the ball at the Philadelphia 40 and had a 
shot at the Bear receiver but missed the tackle, leaving McKinnon to celebrate 
the last 15 yards. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Tomczak completed 10 of 20 for 172 yards before he was forced out in 
the third quarter on a play in which he had his third interception, this one to 
Terry Hoage. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie White hit Tomczak, reinjuring the left shoulder that Tomczak had 
separated several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Jim McMahon, originally forced to the sideline with a twisted knee and then 
kept there by Tomczak's success as a starter, finished the game. 
</P>
<P>
Ditka, the Bear coach, said he would wait to see how severe Tomczak's injury is 
before naming a starter for next week's NFC championship game, where the Bears 
will play host to the winner of today's Minnesota Vikings-San Francisco 49ers 
game. 
</P>
<P>
After giving up the bomb to McKinnon, the Eagles responded with their own 
aerial attack. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, the sun was still out at this point, and the end zone was clearly in 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond reach. 
</P>
<P>
On their first drive after the touchdown, the Eagles wound up with nothing when 
Luis Zendejas missed a 43-yard field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia got the ball back on the first play of the Bears' next drive on 
Seth Joyner's interception. 
</P>
<P>
Then came one of the Eagles' most frustrating drives of the season, exceeded 
only by its next drive. 
</P>
<P>
More about that later. 
</P>
<P>
Taking over at the Chicago 30, Philadelphia drove to the 9, where Cunningham 
hit Cris Carter with a pass in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent touchdown was called back because of illegal motion by running 
back Anthony Toney. 
</P>
<P>
So Cunningham came right back and fired it into the end zone again. This time, 
4 men touched the ball. Defenders Dave Duerson and Mike Richardson got a hand 
on it. Carter also got a piece, batting the ball into the arms of fellow 
receiver Mike Quick. 
</P>
<P>
Touchdown at last? 
</P>
<P>
Not quite. Again a penalty. Again Toney. This time holding. 
</P>
<P>
So the Eagles settled for Zendejas' 42-yard field goal. In all, he would kick 
4, the others coming from 29, 30 and 35 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles' frustration, however, was just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
On their next drive, they reached the Chicago 4, where they faced a fourth and 
1. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham kept the ball on a draw and was hit at the line by Dante Jones. 
</P>
<P>
The officials brought out the chains. And measured. And checked. And checked 
again. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict? 
</P>
<P>
Short by an inch. 
</P>
<P>
On their next drive, the Eagles again apparently had a touchdown in their 
grasp. Keith Jackson was wide open in the end zone, but he jumped too soon for 
Cunningham's perfect pass and dropped it. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago took the ensuing kickoff and drove to another touchdown, Neal Anderson 
going in from the Eagle 4 off left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
By now the fog rolled in, and the Eagles were ready to roll out of postseason 
play. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears added 6 points on Kevin Butler's field goals of 46 and 27 yards. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, Eagle Coach Buddy Ryan, a former assistant at Chicago, where 
he had a long-running feud with Ditka, was asked if he had shaken hands with 
his former head coach. 
</P>
<P>
"What," he asked, "was there to shake about?" 
</P>
<P>
NFC Playoff Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago interceptions were by Mickey Pruitt, Vestee Jackson and Maurice 
Douglass. . . . Keith Jackson, despite his drop, had a big day receiving with 7 
catches for 142 yards. Running back Keith Byars made 9 catches for 103 yards. 
Byars was Philadelphia's leading ballcarrier with 34 yards in 7 carries. . . . 
Thomas Sanders led Chicago with 94 yards rushing, 58 coming on a second-quarter 
run.

Prior to this season, Geoff Courtnall, the Washington Capitals' hard-hitting, 
high-scoring left wing was mainly used as a checker and a guy who would give up 
his body to go into the boards and create havoc with opposing players. If he 
scored, all well and good, but his main job was disturbing the other team's 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
This year all of that has changed and Courtnall is the leading scorer on the 
Capitals and one of the driving offensive forces in the team's surge for first 
place in the Patrick Division of the National Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
"My job in the past was to go after the other guy," said Courtnall, who has 19 
goals and 19 assists entering Tuesday night's game at the Capital Centre at 
Landover, Md., against the Philadelphia Flyers. "My concern was not scoring, 
but stirring things up. I like it much better this year. I like being involved 
in the scoring. I always had a good shot and I always believed I could score, 
but that wasn't my primary role. I did what I was supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
In his previous five seasons with the Boston Bruins, Courtnall, 6-feet-1, 
195-pound, a native of Victoria, British Columbia, scored 82 goals and handed 
out 85 assists in 271 games. Last season, one which he split between Boston and 
Edmonton, was his best scoring year with 36 goals and 30 assists. Barring 
serious injury, he should easily surpass both figures this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals acquired Courtnall, 26, from Edmonton for Greg Adams last July. 
</P>
<P>
"Geoff Courtnall has added a new dimension to our power play and has been our 
most consistent scorer," said Capitals Coach Bryan Murray. "He is a very aware 
hockey player. He sees so much of the ice. Not only is he a very adept passer, 
but he has a tremendous shot. He really has a gun as he has demonstrated on 
many occasions this season. He has been a very welcome addition to our hockey 
club." 
</P>
<P>
Courtnall, whose twin brother Russ plays for the Montreal Canadiens, leads the 
Capitals in home scoring with 12 goals and 10 assists and had the second 
longest scoring streak in team history when he scored in 15 consecutive games 
earlier this season. He leads the team in shots with 120 and collected his 
200th National Hockey League point Dec. 7 against the New Jersey Devils. He 
also has nine power-play goals. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, in his eighth season with Washington, achieved his 300th NHL coaching 
victory Dec. 15. He has coached 581 games and is tied with Tommy Ivan for 16th 
on the all-time victory list. Ivan coached Detroit and Chicago from 1947 until 
1958. 
</P>
<P>
Voting for the teams that will compete in the 40th NHL All-Star game Feb. 7 in 
Edmonton, Alberta, will end Sunday. Voting began in November. 
</P>
<P>
The Wales conference All-Stars will be coached by Terry O'Reilly of the Boston 
Bruins and the Campbell conference team will be coached by Glen Sather of the 
Edmonton Oilers. Norm Ullman and Bruce MacGregor, both former NHL players, have 
been named honorary captains for the game. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford wing Sylvain Turgeon underwent surgery on a separated left shoulder 
Thursday and will be sidelined for three months. The Whalers recalled Dallas 
Gaume from Binghamton of the American Hockey League to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
Where are they now? Reggie Leach, who scored the most goals in a season (61 in 
1976) for the Philadelphia Flyers and played 13 seasons with the Flyers, 
Boston, California and Detroit. He won the Conn Smythe Trophy in 1976 when the 
Flyers won the Stanley Cup by beating Montreal, 4-0. He scored 666 points in 
934 games, including 381 goals. Leach owns Sports Lawn Service in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Hockey fans in Pittsburgh have missed Wayne Gretzky two years in a row. Last 
season, when he was with Edmonton, he missed the Oilers' only game in 
Pittsburgh because of an injury, and this season he missed the Kings' only game 
in Pittsburgh because of his grandmother's funeral. Gretzky said that his 
grandmother, Mary Gretzky, used to sit in a chair and play goalie for him when 
he practiced his shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Petr Klima of the Detroit Red Wings has been going through some highs and lows 
lately. Last week, he went to the airport to meet his parents, Josef and Kveta 
Klima, for a reunion. He had not seen them since he defected from 
Czechoslovakia in August 1985. The next day, he was in court, pleading guilty 
to a drunken driving charge and leaving an accident scene. It was his second 
conviction.

SPORTS COLD WAR IS BEGINNING TO THAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GERGEN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consider it a positive development in international relations that the Soviets 
have become frequent tourists. Familiarity has diluted contempt. Alas, it also 
has dulled the expectations of such meetings. 
</P>
<P>
When Mikhail Gorbachev stepped out of a limousine to shake hands with U.S. 
citizens during his recent visit, he followed the inclination of his nation's 
athletes. For more than a decade, they have enjoyed North American hospitality 
in increasing numbers. Until the advent of glasnost, they just lacked the 
freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
Now there is as much interest, if not more, in what they say as in the way they 
play. When the Central Red Army team meets the New York Islanders at Nassau 
Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y., Thursday night, the focus will be on defenseman 
Vyatcheslav Fetisov, not only because he may be the best in the world at what 
he does, but also because he has made public his frustration in being prevented 
from joining the New Jersey Devils. "If it weren't for Gorbachev," he said 
Wednesday, "this (discussion) would be impossible." 
</P>
<P>
But the sports exchanges between East and West preceded the improved dialogue 
between government officials. This marks the seventh tour of NHL rinks by one 
or more Soviet clubs in the last 13 years, and that doesn't include such 
special events as the Challenge Cup, the Canada Cup or the Rendez-Vous '87 
series. And hockey is merely the tip of the iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Soviet teams have competed in basketball, volleyball, boxing, 
wrestling and, yes, even baseball on U.S. soil. The U.S.S.R. has sent us 
wrestlers and weightlifters, among others, in the past. A decade ago, it even 
entered a team in World Team Tennis. The team wasn't very good, but it was the 
only one in the league that managed to turn a profit. 
</P>
<P>
And now we have in our midst the Red Army team and Dynamo Riga team, which 
played the second game on a western swing Wednesday night in Edmonton, Alberta. 
The NHL is billing it as a Super Series, but it's more superfluous than 
anything. We have passed the point where either side has much to prove in terms 
of superiority. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't the case in 1972, of course. The Soviets were regarded as amateurs 
(in the most derisive sense of the word) by the Canadian hockey establishment 
when the NHL agreed to make available its seasoned pros in an eight-game hockey 
summit. 
</P>
<P>
Officials laughed at the Soviets' equipment before the first game at the 
Montreal Forum, and at least one newspaper columnist promised to eat his words 
if Team Canada lost as much as one game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was our first training camp," Islanders President Bill Torrey recalled 
Wednesday. "We watched the game at the beautiful Holiday Inn in Peterborough 
(Ontario). We went up 2-0 and everyone was saying this is going to be a piece 
of cake." 
</P>
<P>
But the Soviets stormed back to win the first game in a rout, and the NHL's 
best didn't clinch a 4-3-1 series victory until the final minute of the final 
game, played in Moscow. "That was my last year of midgets," said Bryan 
Trottier, then a 16-year-old in rural Saskatchewan. "I remember the last game 
was on at 11 o'clock. The whole school shut down and we all went to the 
auditorium to watch it on television." 
</P>
<P>
The drama, intensified by the belief that the teams were upholding a way of 
life, was riveting. And the lack of previous contact between the groups led to 
suspicion. There was the story of Wayne Cashman, who, convinced his hotel room 
in Moscow was bugged, located a foreign-looking object underneath the carpet 
and proceeded to unscrew it, sending a chandelier in the room below toppling to 
the floor. 
</P>
<P>
From a sporting standpoint, the cold war between East and West ended on the ice 
in Moscow. The World Hockey Association sent a team of all-stars to Moscow two 
years later and, in 1976, the Soviets sent two club teams to tour North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
On the evening before the Red Army made its initial appearance at the Coliseum 
almost 13 years ago, Islanders owner Roy Boe hosted a reception for the 
visitors. "If you want plenty of beer or vodka," he said, "we'll do what we can 
to help." 
</P>
<P>
North American teams have since gone beyond providing alcohol for the visitors. 
Last summer, the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association 
worked to rehabilitate the Achilles injury that had sidelined Soviet center 
Arvidas Sabonis. He returned from the injury in time to lead his country to an 
upset of the U.S. team in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Such consideration didn't make everyone in the United States happy. John 
Thompson, for one, was critical of Americans giving aid to the enemy even 
before the team he coached was ambushed in Seoul, South Korea. But, as the 
Trail Blazers explained, they were only protecting their own investment. They 
had drafted Sabonis and were hopeful that he would be permitted to wear a 
Portland uniform after the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
They're still waiting, as are the Devils for Fetisov. Many on both sides 
believe it's inevitable that individual Soviet athletes will be permitted to 
play for professional teams in North America, further blurring the distinctions 
in lifestyle that once gave such bite to games between the East and West. 
</P>
<P>
"In the actual situation of world extension, of the relationship between our 
countries," Soviet forward Igor Larionov said Wednesday through an interpreter, 
"it's a good step." Larionov has been drafted by the Vancouver Canucks. Is he 
interested in playing here? "Why not?" he replied, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps some day there will be Soviets sprinkled throughout the NHL, the NBA 
and other professional leagues. And perhaps at such a time the presence of even 
the leader of the U.S.S.R. won't halt traffic in New York.

DYNAMO RIGA PROVES TOO MUCH FOR KINGS, 'COACH' MCNALL, 5-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Owner Bruce McNall was behind the Kings' bench for the game against the Soviet 
team Saturday night, wearing a sweater proclaiming him, "Coach." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, when they presented him with the chance to coach the team in this 
exhibition game, they expected it to be a pleasant experience. The Kings were 
supposed to beat Dynamo Riga. 
</P>
<P>
The big surprise was that Dynamo Riga defeated the Kings, 5-3, before a crowd 
of 11,490 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"The coaches wanted me to see what it was like behind the bench," McNall said. 
"I found out that it's confusing. It's upsetting. I don't know how they do it. 
. . . It was interesting. But I guess I did something wrong. Anyway, they told 
me that's the last time I coach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty humiliating for me to be canned after my coaching debut." 
</P>
<P>
It was pretty humiliating for the Kings to lose to Dynamo Riga, a young team 
that was playing its fourth game in 5 days after traveling from Calgary to 
Edmonton to Vancouver to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Dynamo Riga, the weaker of the two Soviet teams making a tour of the National 
Hockey League, had been losing ground with every game. The visitors opened with 
a 2-2 tie at Calgary, lost at Edmonton, 2-1, then lost at Vancouver, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
But against the Kings, they jumped out to a 5-1 lead before Wayne McBean and 
Wayne Gretzky narrowed the gap with third-period goals. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Robbie Ftorek of the Kings said: "We weren't trying to make light of this 
game by asking Bruce to coach, but we thought it would be a good time to let 
him see what happens during a game. 
</P>
<P>
"We might have given the impression that this game was not important to us, but 
it's only not important until you step on the ice. Then you want to win. 
</P>
<P>
"We have three big (Smythe Division) games coming up, and we wanted to play 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the third period, we asked the guys to go out and try to win the period 
to put us in a good frame of mind for going to Calgary, and they did that," 
Ftorek said. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings won the final period, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
But that was after the Soviets won the first, 2-1, and the second, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Dynamo Riga Coach Vladimir Yurzinov said: "I am satisfied with how my team 
played tonight. It was a very important game for our team from a psychological 
point of view. If we had lost this game, it would have put us in a difficult 
position." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the difference between the 2 teams, Yurzinov said: "The L.A. Kings 
were not fast tonight. The difference in their speed and ours was just about 
the same difference as between us and Vancouver." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets struck for 2 quick goals in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
On the first goal, Anatoli Semenov put his stick on the ice to deflect a pass, 
which sent the puck flying over goalie Mark Fitzpatrick's left shoulder at 
14:38. 
</P>
<P>
Andrei Lomakin got an unassisted goal at 15:31 when Fitzpatrick apparently 
thought he had made the stop, but the puck had another couple of inches of 
momentum. It glanced off his stick and into the corner of the goal . 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Nicholls scored the first goal for the Kings at 16:26 of the first 
period, a wrist shot from the left circle. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets took a 3-1 lead in the second period, taking advantage of the power 
play after Mike Krushelnyski was called for hooking. Sergei Selyanin lifted a 
left-handed slap shot over the outstretched glove of Fitzpatrick at 6:47. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets went ahead, 4-1, when Alexi Frolikov picked up a loose puck, turned 
and fired from 40 feet away. Dynamo Riga made it 5-1 when Alexander Smirnov 
sent the puck from the blue line, through traffic, and past Fitzpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
Left wing Bob Carpenter of the Kings suffered a bruised right wrist early in 
the third period and was taken to Centinela Hospital Medical Center for X-rays.

MORNING BRIEFING: SOME WINNING QUOTATIONS FROM 1988 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Happy New Year. Here are some selected one-liners from 1988: 
</P>
<P>
 Frank King, chairman of the Calgary Winter Olympics organizing committee: 
"Wherever I go, people are waving at me. Maybe if I do a good job, they'll use 
all their fingers." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Valvano, North Carolina State basketball coach and athletic director, on 
college administrators: "Monday through Friday, they want you to be like 
Harvard. On Saturday, they want you to play like Oklahoma." 
</P>
<P>
Julius Erving, on Charles Barkley of the Philadelphia 76ers: "When Charles 
first came into the league, his body proportions were out of whack. He looked 
more like Dom DeLuise. Now he looks like Michelangelo's statue David. The only 
thing that is fat now is his head." 
</P>
<P>
Lee Trevino, to a woman who saw him washing the windows at his home and asked 
him how much he charged: "Lady, the woman in this house lets me sleep with 
her." 
</P>
<P>
Billy Martin, asked if he had a drinking problem: "The only problem is that you 
run into a guy who's a banker in the afternoon and thinks he's King Kong at 
night. If one of those guys tries something with me, I'll drop him." 
</P>
<P>
Golfer JoAnne Carner, crediting Martin with teaching her how to win: "The only 
thing I never learned from Billy Martin was how to knock a guy out in a bar." 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Mike Scott of the Houston Astros, after the attendance figure of 1938 
was put on the scoreboard in Atlanta: "I didn't know if that was the attendance 
or the year Nolan Ryan was born." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Manger Tom Lasorda, asked by Chicago reporters how fast Don Sutton was 
pitching: "We had him clocked at 92 -- 45 going to Rick Dempsey and 47 coming 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Thompson of Georgetown, on the criticism he's received: "It doesn't 
bother me. The more I'm criticized, the more my speaking fee goes up." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rodman of the Detroit Pistons, asked if he would kiss Magic Johnson on 
the cheek as Isiah Thomas did: "I think we should get engaged first." 
</P>
<P>
Comedian Jackie Mason, claiming Michael Spinks didn't train properly for Mike 
Tyson: "He should have taken voice lessons, so he could have yelled for help." 
</P>
<P>
CBS announcer Jim Nantz, at a roast for Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson: "The only 
time Jimmy didn't run up the score was 27 years ago, when he took the SAT." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Lou Holtz of Notre Dame, on his youth: "You hear people talking about an 
inferiority complex. Me, I didn't have a complex. I was inferior." 
</P>
<P>
David Letterman: "Baseball was an exhibition sport in the Olympics this year -- 
sort of like it was in Baltimore." 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Hatcher of the Dodgers, on Kirk Gibson's ninth-inning home run in Game 1 
of the World Series: "I wanted to go out and kiss the guy, but he never 
shaves." 
</P>
<P>
Oakland's Jose Canseco, on Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser: "I'm going to hire 
him as my personal hitting coach." 
</P>
<P>
Craig Fertig, former USC quarterback and assistant coach who is the new 
associate athletic director at UC Irvine: "There's a rumor we're going to start 
playing football. The first call I get is from Terry Donahue. He wants to 
schedule us." 
</P>
<P>
Lou Holtz, asked the effect the suspension of two players for being late to a 
team meal had on the team's punctuality: "At the next pregame meal, our guys 
came and watched them prepare it."

STRUGGLING BILLS MAY HAVE THEIR DIFFICULTIES AGAINST THOSE ORNERY OILERS 
</P>

ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Houston Oilers are coming, the Houston Oilers are coming. 
</P>
<P>
America's incorrigibles are on the road again, their reputations preceding 
them, threatening another hometown darling. Today it's the Buffalo Bills, 
playing their first playoff game at home in 22 years before their wild, crazy, 
longest-suffering, ready-to-party-hearty fans. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills are 3 1/2-point favorites, although a look at their recent record 
makes you wonder. 
</P>
<P>
Meet the Paper Bills? 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo had the league's best record -- 11-1 -- until losing 3 of its last 4. 
The Bills were outrushed in the losses, 232 to 110 yards, 110-39 and 53-19, an 
ominous sign for a conservative team. Also, Shane Conlan, the inside linebacker 
who was a key to their rushing defense until he missed all of the late losses, 
is expected to sit out again; quarterback Jim Kelly is under increasing fire, 
and some of it is coming from a teammate. 
</P>
<P>
That's halfback Robb Riddick, who recently told a TV station in Rochester, 
N.Y., "I just don't feel Jim is doing the job he is being paid to do." 
</P>
<P>
Riddick was upset that the backs weren't being thrown enough passes, although 
you have to wonder which games he has been watching. More than one-third of 
Kelly's completions have gone to his backs. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Marv Levy was upset with the timing of the remarks and said there was 
nothing to it. 
</P>
<P>
"Robb came back and called Jim Kelly that night," Levy said. "He told him the 
remarks came out much different than he'd expected and apologized for whatever 
embarrassment there was. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim said, 'Forget it, I know how these things happen, we've got more important 
things to deal with than that.' " 
</P>
<P>
That Kelly is a brick, isn't he? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, he may have been a tiny bit more perturbed than Levy said he was. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly is generally considered one of the game's best young quarterbacks, has 
just made the Pro Bowl over such candidates as Dan Marino and John Elway . . . 
and has been getting ripped in letters to the editor and on radio talk shows by 
the arch-supportive Bills faithful. There's a reason for it too -- try 15 
touchdown passes against 17 interceptions, compared to the 41-28 ratio he 
compiled in his first 2 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Irony: As he starts to get his greatest praise since entering the league, he's 
drawing his most heat, too. 
</P>
<P>
Bottom line: He's getting angry about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so tired of hearing about negative things," he said last week, when the 
Riddick question came up. 
</P>
<P>
But hadn't Riddick called to apologize, etc.? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," said Kelly, without enthusiasm, "he called." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Bills still have Bruce Smith (11 sacks in 12 games), 
Cornelius Bennett (9 1/2), Fred Smerlas and the rest of that rock-ribbed 
defense that got them here. The Oilers, renowned, warm-weather warriors, will 
face a more forbidding day than they got last week at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills are already braced for all of those Oiler tough-guy tactics, vowing 
not to retaliate, as the Browns' Ernest Byner did, earning back-to-back 
roughing penalties and killing a drive. However, you might conclude that the 
Oilers' Raider-type reputation is already working for them: the Bills are 
spending all this time worrying about what the Oilers will do and how they'll 
handle it. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Oilers have been on their best behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Glanville, fresh from eliminating the Browns and bringing down their 
coaching staff, took it easy on Buffalo, where he was an assistant 1 season. He 
said nothing bad about the town, which has provided fertile material for so 
many comedians, except to remark that he was leaving tickets for the late Jay 
Silverheels, the local actor who used to play Tonto. 
</P>
<P>
For a change, the most hated Oiler isn't their macho little coach but General 
Manager Ladd Herzeg. It was Herzeg who, in 1987, was accused of having made an, 
uh, impolite gesture during an argument at the team's hotel with members of a 
wedding party. 
</P>
<P>
Assault charges were filed against Herzeg but dropped by a Buffalo judge, on 
the condition that Herzeg stays out of local trouble. 
</P>
<P>
If those wedding receptions quit hassling him, he'll be fine. 
</P>
<P>
AFC Playoff Notes 
</P>
<P>
Come Back, Shane: the Bills sent Shane Conlan to Birmingham, Ala., last week to 
have Dr. James Andrews look at his injured arch which isn't responding to rest 
or therapy. Said Coach Marv Levy: "We're not counting on him, but we haven't 
counted him out." . . . Classic confrontation: Houston's offensive line, with 
its three, high No. 1 picks (Pro Bowl guards Bruce Matthews and Mike Munchak, 
and tackle Dean Steinkuhler) against the Bills' defensive front, which has four 
No. 1s (Pro Bowl players Bruce Smith, Cornelius Bennett, Conlan and Art Still) 
and two No. 2s (Pro Bowl player Fred Smerlas and Darryl Talley). . . . Key 
matchup, or Battle of the Bruces: Oiler left tackle Bruce Davis, the former 
Raider, vs. Bill right end Bruce Smith, second only to the Eagles' Reggie White 
in potential to disable an entire offense by himself. Smerlas, the colorful 
nose tackle, faces center Jay Pennison, who the Raiders considered the Oiler 
line's weak link. Of course, the Raiders thought Smerlas was a hype, too. . . . 
The Bills are 11-1 when they have rushed for more than 100 yards. However, the 
underrated Oiler defense was No. 1 in the American Football Conference against 
the run. . . . Levy, on defensing the Oilers: "They're not one dimensional. 
There's no one thing to stop. We can't say something like, 'Stop Eric Dickerson 
and you'll stop the Colts. It's not that simple. They have a superior offensive 
line, great receivers, a fine quarterback (Warren Moon) who gets better all the 
time and that tremendous stable of runners."

IT HAS BEEN QUITE A REIGN FOR DUKE; 
</P>
<P>
BIG TEN COMMISSIONER WILL RETIRE WHEN A REPLACEMENT IS CHOSEN 
</P>

One of Wayne Duke's most prized possessions is the clipping from Sports 
Illustrated that pictures him with John Wayne at the Rose parade. John Wayne 
sent him the clipping and signed it, "To Wayne Duke from Duke Wayne." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Duke, commissioner of the Big Ten, smiles when he tells about that 
now-fading momento. 
</P>
<P>
So you see, Duke does have some fond memories of the annual trip he has made to 
California for the Rose Bowl every year for the past 18 years. But ask him 
about the highlights and lowlights of his New Year's Day ritual and he gives 
that familiar Wayne Duke grimace. 
</P>
<P>
He had been in town less than 3 hours Wednesday and he had already been asked 
why the Big Ten can't win the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Since announcing his retirement last summer, a retirement that will become 
effective in the upcoming year when a successor is chosen, Duke has had plenty 
of opportunities to review his tenure as leader of the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
The conference boasts the largest football and basketball attendance in the 
country, and that comes from winning a lot of games. 
</P>
<P>
Duke was chairman of the NCAA basketball tournament committee that expanded the 
field to 64 teams and upped the TV rights so that the tournament now brings in 
about $55 million. 
</P>
<P>
Duke was on the committee that put together a $103 million TV package between 
the Big Ten and the Rose Bowl that will run through 1997. 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl game is truly dear to his heart. Duke has always been able to 
refer to the game as "the granddaddy of them all" without cracking a smile at 
the corny sound. He believes it. 
</P>
<P>
It's a traditional matchup, and Duke believes that college football should be 
more traditional, should match schools and school spirits for the pride and the 
memories and the glory, not an abstract No. 1 and No. 2 for a mythical title. 
</P>
<P>
"You can have a 'national championship' game in Phoenix this year, or, from 
time to time, in Miami, but this game will be sold out year after year after 
year," Duke said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl is his kind of college football. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Byers, the longtime executive director of the NCAA, now retired, who 
strongly influenced Duke during his early years in the NCAA office, told the 
Chicago Tribune: "We both came from the romantic era in sports. Emphasis was 
placed on values to be learned from the game. You competed because you enjoyed 
it." 
</P>
<P>
While he can get quite philosophical about the over-emphasis on winning and 
losing, even at the level of eighth-grade soccer his grandson plays, Duke 
cannot deny the impact it has on him to have to see his teams lose. 
</P>
<P>
"I go in the dressing rooms," Duke said. "I try to go to our team's dressing 
room after any game I see in the conference. I always go down after the Rose 
Bowl game. And there's a disappointment in there after a loss. People who are 
critical of our bowl record, or even people who are critical of the team's 
performance that day, don't have to see, first hand, the terrible 
disappointment that is felt by the players and the coaches who have put so much 
into the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy up in the stands who has been tailgating all day and who thinks he has 
all the answers, doesn't have to see what losing does to the players and the 
coaches." 
</P>
<P>
Or what it does to Duke, who has come back up to the pressbox looking so 
distressed that writers have joked about keeping an eye on him so he doesn't 
jump from the roof. 
</P>
<P>
Duke tries to keep smiling. "Tom Hansen (commissioner of the Pacific 10) tells 
me I'm a very good loser," Duke said. "I tell him, that's because I've had a 
lot of practice." 
</P>
<P>
But it doesn't get easier. 
</P>
<P>
As he flipped through the pages of his memories, Duke could not seem to 
separate good times and bad times in Southern California from the wins and the 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you the contrast," Duke said. "The first year we were here and 
something that happened just last year make a good contrast." 
</P>
<P>
The first year Duke and his wife, Martha, came out for the Rose Bowl game, 
Stanford beat Michigan. It was after the 1971 season. 
</P>
<P>
For the Duke family, it was an emotional time, anyway. He had become Big Ten 
commissioner on Sept. 1, 1971, after 8 years as commissioner of the Big Eight 
and 11 years of service in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. office. They 
had just sold their home of 19 years to make the move to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
After all those years of going to Miami every holiday season for the Orange 
Bowl, they were in Southern California -- where it was raining. 
</P>
<P>
The Michigan team was having to practice in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing was looking too rosy. 
</P>
<P>
And then, the all-important game. In the final minutes of the game, Michigan 
got a safety to go ahead of Stanford, 12-10. But Don Bunce, the Stanford 
quarterback, took Stanford down the field and Rod Garcia kicked a field goal to 
beat the Wolverines. 
</P>
<P>
"Martha and I had been talking about how the final standings would go if 
Michigan lost, and we knew that Big Eight teams were going to be 1-2-3," Duke 
said. "We'd been talking about that for days. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, Lawrence Welk was grand marshal of the parade that year, and he was at 
the Tournament House that night for the party. He stood up there and said, 'A-1 
and a-2 and a-3,' and Martha burst into tears." 
</P>
<P>
Not a happy memory. 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes decided in subsequent years to skip the party at the Tournament 
House. It was a celebration. Often the Big Ten contingent didn't feel like 
celebrating. The Dukes would go back to the presidential suite at the Pasadena 
Hilton to spend the evening with Big Ten guests. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, when Michigan State beat USC, they again skipped the Tournament 
House celebration. It wouldn't look right to show up only after a victory. 
</P>
<P>
So the Dukes were back in their suite that evening, savoring a victory that, 
admittedly, was a "blue collar win . . . a game we won after USC fumbled, but 
we'd lost a lot of games that way" when there was a knock at the door. 
</P>
<P>
"All the Rose Bowl officers -- Harriman Cronk and all the rest -- came to bring 
me my Rose Bowl watch," Duke said. "That was a highlight. They left their 
celebration to bring that to me, and I appreciated that." 
</P>
<P>
There were some points in their long relationship when some of the Rose Bowl 
folks were not too happy with Duke, when he sided with the movement to exclude 
the exclusivity clause from the Rose Bowl contract. 
</P>
<P>
Some feared that allowing Big Ten and Pac-10 teams to compete in other bowls, 
also, would dilute the impact of the Rose Bowl. Duke believed that the Rose 
Bowl, matching the champions of the conferences, would remain as strong as ever 
while letting more teams compete would be of benefit to both conferences. 
</P>
<P>
He was right, as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few years, Big Ten and Pac-10 schools have claimed an average of 
40% of the total bowl pot of about $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
Duke points out that opening opportunities was good for parity in his 
conference, good for attendance, good for recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
"When I had just been named commissioner of the Big Eight, and I was only 34 
years old at the time, one of the first things I faced was the news that the 
Orange Bowl was terminating our exclusive contract," Duke said. "They wanted to 
be able to invite the top teams, to have a 'national championship' game. 
</P>
<P>
"Sports Illustrated wrote that the loss of that contract would be the death 
knoll of the Big Eight. Actually, it turned out to be a boon to the Big Eight. 
It opened up vistas for other bowls. We went to the Cotton Bowl, the Sugar Bowl 
and the Orange Bowl. It was great for our conference." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Rose Bowl changed its policy, and the Big Ten started to compete in 
other bowls in 1976, Big Ten schools have taken 56 bowl berths. 
</P>
<P>
Duke and his wife have been at a bowl game on New Year's Day for the last 26 
years. They might attend a bowl game just for fun next year. Or they might not. 
</P>
<P>
If he's not at the Rose Bowl next year, he says he'll miss it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been to most of the bowl games at one time or another," Duke said. "I've 
been to all the major bowls -- Orange, Cotton, Sugar. . . . And this is not to 
degrade any of the others. But I think the Rose Bowl is special."

FOOTBALL GIVES OKLAHOMA BLACK EYE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN STEADMAN, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a proposal for the governor of Oklahoma, the honorable Henry Bellmon. 
Roll up your sleeves, take a broom from the maintenance shed and, in one quick 
motion, sweep out the entire administration of the state university ... 
specifically the interim president, athletic director and football coach. Not 
under the rug, but out the door. 
</P>
<P>
It's particularly distressing that violations of recruiting rules have once 
again brought deep embarrassment to the school, its faculty and proud alumni. 
The University of Oklahoma has been slapped with a three-year probation for 
blatant disregard of the NCAA code. Too bad. 
</P>
<P>
There's something wrong in the thought process when Oklahoma puts such an 
emphasis on winning football games that it pays $1,000 to an athlete and 
provides an individual scalping service for varsity players so they can 
conveniently pocket the ticket money. If the governor isn't ashamed, then he's 
not conversant with what's going on in the state that elected him to provide 
proper guidance and supervision. 
</P>
<P>
It's personally distressing because we never met a man (or woman) from Oklahoma 
we didn't like. We once hitch-hiked from Tulsa to Claremore to visit the Will 
Rogers Museum in an effort to learn more about the old rope-spinning, 
yarn-telling cowboy philosopher. Our interest in Oklahoma has been so extensive 
that it resulted in the state's officially confirming upon us the title of 
"Honorary Okie," with an actual certificate and button to go with it. 
</P>
<P>
Now Oklahoma, in a football way, has gone and inflicted injury to itself by 
drawing still another suspension. This is the fourth time the football program 
has been penalized in as many decades. How much longer is this type of 
despicable conduct going to continue? 
</P>
<P>
The violation shows Oklahoma has found still another way to disgrace itself. 
It's also reminiscent of what the former OU president, speaking facetiously, 
once said: "We're going to build a university the football team can be proud 
of." Humorous or not, it's disgusting that education at Oklahoma is besmirched 
by what's going on in the hunt for prospects who can block and tackle. 
</P>
<P>
As for Coach Barry Switzer, the NCAA statement declared he "failed to exercise 
supervisory control." It's as though he went out to lunch and stayed when the 
problems were occurring. The duty to conduct a clean operation belongs to him. 
If his assistants and office help were involved in illegal tactics, then he is 
the one who should be compelled to pay the penalty. 
</P>
<P>
If it was the military and something such as this happened, then the duty 
officer in charge would be brought up on allegations of incompetency and maybe 
even stripped of his commission. Switzer should be taking the rap for what has 
happened. How can he be held blameless? 
</P>
<P>
The governor should ask for his resignation by nightfall and advise him to take 
his services to Texas A&amp;M, Houston or SMU. The assessment of the charges, 
bringing severe discipline, tells the public Switzer doesn't know what's going 
on in his own shop, or coaching offices. It's time to assess Barry's value to 
Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
It would be within the bounds of the governor's authority to suggest Switzer 
clean out his desk and be off the parking lot before the band strikes up the 
refrain of "Bye-Bye, Barry." It's obvious the transgressions need to be 
addressed from the governor's office and dealt with expeditiously. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma has been thrown for a severe loss. And what did the president, David 
Swank, who has the role on a temporary basis, say about it? He reacted by 
disclosing the university could lose between $750,000 and $1 million in each of 
the next two seasons. Athletic Director Donnie Duncan said, "I think the way of 
summing up the way I feel is they wanted us and they got us." 
</P>
<P>
This is a play for sympathy, trying to paint a picture of the NCAA 
investigators as being biased against the Sooners. That's a cop-out. When one 
of the dominant football-playing universities in the land puts itself in this 
position, how can it permit the man it pays to head its football show to open 
his arms and say he didn't know what the men and women he hired were doing? 
</P>
<P>
There has to be a line of responsibility somewhere. And the man out in front 
leading the entire effort is the head coach, Switzer. Does he walk away while 
two assistant coaches, Mike Jones and Scott Hill, and a recruiting coordinator, 
Shirley Vaughan, who was removed from her job, are painted as scapegoats and 
burned at the goal post? 
</P>
<P>
Switzer is an adult and has been at Oklahoma for 16 years. He knows the burden 
is on his shoulders. The university should consider terminating his contract 
and suspending football for the next five years. This would demonstrate good 
faith and do wonders for reclaiming the clean and ethical reputation Oklahoma 
deserves to have.

<P>
Alabama may have defeated Northeast Louisiana, but the Crimson Tide took a 
beating off the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
Thieves broke into Bryant Hall, the school's athletic dormitory, before 
Thursday night's game and stole about $2,000 worth of property belonging to 4 
Alabama players, campus police said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Mark Shockley of the University Police Department said the thieves entered 
two rooms Thursday between 6 and 7 p.m., just before the beginning of the 
Crimson Tide's 80-65 victory over Northeast Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some electronic items stolen, some clothes, shoes and items of that 
nature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Wimp Sanderson said the thieves stole a television and video cassette 
recorder belonging to freshman Robert Horry. Another freshman, Marcus Webb, 
lost a gold watch and other items. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the guys lost clothes," Sanderson told the Tuscaloosa News. "Some lost 
just about everything they had." 
</P>
<P>
Shockley said Bryant Hall "appeared to have been open" at the time of the 
heist. "The rooms which they entered also appear to have been open," he added. 
"Some other rooms appear to have been tampered with but we are not sure about 
that at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson said the thieves "had to be . . . fairly familiar with the dorm. They 
would seem to have known where the basketball players live, when they would 
have been out of the dorm and they knew the football players and some of the 
staff were out of town for Christmas. The basketball players were the only ones 
who would have had things there." 
</P>
<P>
University police are investigating the crime, and Sanderson also is trying to 
help recover some of the stolen items. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is anyone out there who knows how to help these guys get their things 
back, then I will post a reward," the coach said. "We would really just like to 
recover their property."

STEVE PATE RETURNING TO SAN DIEGO AREA -- ONE OF HIS FAVORITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mal Florence 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's understandable if Steve Pate is partial to the San Diego area. The PGA 
Tour was in its early stages last year and he had already won two tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
The former UCLA All-American won the MONY Tournament of Champions at La Costa 
followed by a victory in the Shearson Lehman Hutton Open, formerly known as the 
San Diego Open. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal last year was to win twice and I did it in San Diego, so I'd have to 
say it's been a pretty good area for me," Pate said. 
</P>
<P>
Pate would, of course, like the new year to be as rewarding as 1988. Winning 
early certainly eases any anxiety he might have as to how he's progressing. 
</P>
<P>
Pate, 27, who will defend his title in the Tournament of Champions starting 
Thursday at La Costa, has steadily advanced on the money list in his 4 years on 
the Tour. 
</P>
<P>
He earned $89,358 in 1985, $176,100 in 1986, $335,728 in 1987 and $582,473 in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
"After that great start I was hoping to win more," Pate said. "I guess I was a 
little greedy, but I had a good stretch at the end of the year even though I 
didn't win. Coming back to La Costa puts me in a winning frame of mind again." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he has any long-term goals, the Simi Valley resident said: "I'd like 
to win every week but, obviously, that isn't going to happen. I'd like to win 
more than once this year and defend one of my championships. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't made any major changes in my game, or mental approach. I'm just 
getting better at it, like refining my swing. And I don't let bad things bother 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Pate says the T of C is the best quality field of the year. To qualify one must 
win a PGA Tour tournament, or the British Open in the 12 months since the last 
Tournament of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
And there's quite an attrition rate from year to year. Of the record 38 
qualifiers in 1988, only 13 will return to shoot for the first prize of 
$135,000 and a total purse of $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
Pate, who finished 12th on the money list in 1988, played in 30 tour events in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to try to play less than 30 tournaments this year, but I hate to 
read about people making all that money while I'm sitting at home." 
</P>
<P>
The Nabisco Championships last November at Pebble Beach paid Curtis Strange 
$360,000 for winning a playoff with Tom Kite. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Nabisco tournament unfairly tilts the money winning total, Pate 
said: "I think it does. That it can swing that much in one week I don't think 
is particularly fair. But if I had to make a decision of not having the 
tournament, or having it, I'd have it the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
Pate is sometimes confused by galleries with Jerry Pate, a former U.S. Open 
winner, whose career has been curtailed by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Pate takes it in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I look a whole like Jerry," "A lot of people follow me because 
they think I'm Jerry. In an offhand way it gives me more recognition. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people even ask me about diving in a lake." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Pate made a famous splash after winning the Tournament Players 
Championship in 1982 -- and the memory lingers on. 
</P>
<P>
As for Steve Pate, he might not be adverse to diving in a lake if he shoots 
consecutive rounds of 66 as he did last year on his way to winning the rain 
abbreviated T of C by a stroke over Larry Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
After he won last year, taking a check for $90,000, Pate said: "I'm not going 
to lie to you that I was disappointed that the last round was canceled. A win 
is a win. You take it any way you can." 
</P>
<P>
He has been sharp lately, shooting a 64 to tie the course record at Kapalua in 
Maui in the Kirin Cup competition. 
</P>
<P>
It was also a memorable year off the course for Pate. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on the fifth hole playing in the Honda tournament when I got word that 
my wife, Sheri, was about ready to have our first child. I ran off the course, 
set a speed record driving to the Miami Airport and just missed the plane by 2 
minutes," he said. "I had to wait 4 hours for the next flight. 
</P>
<P>
"In Los Angeles, I raced to the hospital from LAX and missed my daughter 
Nicole's birth by an hour. Fortunately, Sheri and Nicole came through in great 
shape, but I was a nervous wreck." 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes

Orel Hershiser, the Dodger Cy Young Award winner; New York Mets catcher Gary 
Carter and Julius (Dr. J) Irving, the former star forward for the Philadelphia 
76ers, will be among celebrities in the 30th annual Bob Hope Chrysler Classic 
to be held Jan. 11-15 over four courses in the Palm Springs area. Other 
celebrities include baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth, and former 
professional sports stars Don Meredith, Johnny Bench and George Blanda. Former 
president Gerald Ford is among the traditional participants. . . . Howard 
Cosell's Day with the All-Americans celebrity tournament precedes the Bob Hope 
tournament on Jan. 10 at the Morningside resort course at Rancho Mirage.

Rare eagles: Cliff Rettig eagled a 495-yard par-5 hole at the San Luis Obispo 
Country Club. Not that newsowrthy in itself. However, his wife, Pat, eagled the 
same hole the next day with a 7-wood shot from 135 yards. . . . Jim Porter has 
been named director of golf at Oakmont Country Club. He replaces Skip Whitt,

BENIRSCHKE HAS MASTERED HIS NEW JOB, DOWN TO THE LETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Rolf Benirschke, the excellent former kicker for the San Diego Chargers, is 
going to be the new host of the daytime "Wheel of Fortune." A bit of a surprise 
choice, wouldn't you say, considering that Rolf Benirschke is not exactly a 
household name -- unless you're in the Zendejas house. Really, let's say you're 
spinning the wheel, and the puzzle's a name, and B, N, R, S, C, H and K are 
already lit, and you buy the I and E. Now you're looking at the whole name, and 
you still can't place it or pronounce it, so you're thinking: It has to be a 
trick puzzle. "Pat, I'd like to buy an A." 
</P>
<P>
Last year in an interview, Vanna White was asked what tips she would give to 
Wheel wanna-bes, and she said, "You have to know the whole alphabet." 
</P>
<P>
Of course! 
</P>
<P>
How stupid I was to think I could get away with stopping at S. 
</P>
<P>
The way Benirschke got the gig is pure Hollywood. He was a guest on an L.A. 
morning TV show, chatting about staying healthy -- you might remember 
Benirschke's near-fatal bout with ulcerative colitis -- and who should be 
watching the show but jaunty little rich guy Merv Griffin, creator of "Wheel of 
Fortune." Merv was so taken by Benirschke, he offered him the host's job on 
"Windfall," Merv's newest game show. According to Benirschke's assistant, 
Debbie Marshall, "Merv conveyed this to Rolf: 'You're a genuine, sincere person 
who loves people, and that's what I'm looking for.' " Gosh darn it, that's what 
separates Merv from the pack, the ability to see all that in one guest shot. 
</P>
<P>
As well he should have been, Benirschke was slightly embarrassed. He hadn't 
gone to college and majored in zoology to be a game-show host. (Years ago I did 
a story on Rick Barry, who told me his ambition was to be a game-show host. He 
was the first real, live person to say that to me. Before that, I assumed 
game-show hosts were bionic Ken dolls.) But Benirschke agreed to do an 
audition. "It was my illness jumping in," Benirschke said, explaining, 
"Surviving my illness taught me how neat life really is, and that you should 
live it and enjoy all of its experiences and possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Benirschke's audition was so impressive that Merv suggested he forget about 
"Windfall" entirely, and aim higher: at The Wheel. In all, 30 tried out for The 
Wheel, including Jimmy Connors. (Hard to believe Jimbo knows all 26 letters. He 
usually gets stuck on "I"; he must have gotten coaching.) Why Benirschke? This 
is a direct quote from Shannon Williams of Merv Griffin Productions: "They 
liked his open and sincere quality. He was real sincere with Vanna. He looks 
good with Vanna -- that's very important -- they make a good look. (They make a 
good look?) Vanna likes him. And he understands the game." Excuse me, the 
people who don't understand the game, what stumps them, is it tricky consonants 
like J and V? Do they think the game is unfair, that it aims too high up the 
intelligentsia ladder? 
</P>
<P>
Some will ask if Rolf Benirschke was really the most qualified man to fill Pat 
Sajak's shoes. (We're talking gigantic shoes in game-show annal.) Merv liked 
him, and that's good enough for me. Don't laugh. Dan Quayle got to be vice 
president because George Bush liked him, and that was good enough for you. Come 
to think of it, Dan Quayle looks just like a game-show host. Anyway, what are 
the qualifications? The ability to spell his own name seems to overqualify Rolf 
Benirschke for "Wheel of Fortune." Anybody can spell Vanna White. Well, that 
double-N might be too much for some people, but it's not like the only thing 
keeping if off PBS. 
</P>
<P>
A fine, bright and charitable fellow -- the NFL's "Man of the Year" in 1983 and 
co-chairman of the National Foundation for Ileitis and Colitis -- Benirschke 
has maintained his sense of humor about his new job. The other day he was asked 
if it didn't feel a bit preposterous to be a game-show host, and he said, 
"Obviously it does. My father (Dr. Kurt Benirschke) is an internationally known 
professor of pathology, a physician, an author, and his son is asking people: 
'Do you want to buy a vowel?' " 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, it's a breakthrough. Other athletes have become actors, such as Ed 
Marinaro, Mike Warren, Fred Dryer and Alex Karras. But game-show hosting is a 
whole new field for jocks to consider. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie (Silent Movie) Murray, for example. He's well suited for a non-verbal 
show like "Win, Lose or Draw." Tommy Lasorda could guest-host, and they could 
change the name of the show to "Win, Lose or Eat." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, who's in more "Jeopardy" than Jerry Tarkanian? 
</P>
<P>
"The Newlywed Game" is a natural for veterans Joe Montana or Hal Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
George Steinbrenner could host "The Price Is Right," and yell out, "Billy 
Martin, you sly boots, come on down . . . again!" 
</P>
<P>
Mike and Robin absolutely have to co-host "Love Connection." 
</P>
<P>
For "The Dating Game," the leaders in the clubhouse are Wade (Mr. Polaroid) 
Boggs and Mark (Do You Think I'm Sexy, Or Simply Stupid) Gastineau. 
</P>
<P>
So Rolf, good luck, we'll be watching. And remember, it's A, E, I, O, U and 
sometimes Y.

BRILLIANCE ROUTINE FOR MARIO LEMIEUX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF JACOBS, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PITTSBURGH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rob Brown, who resembles Benjamin Franklin and is almost as quotable, looked at 
the questioner as if he were some kind of heretic. 
</P>
<P>
"Does ANYTHING Mario Lemieux do on the ice surprise me?" Brown, 20, a 
Pittsburgh Penguins winger, said, repeating the question. "People who only see 
him play once in a while may be shocked when they see Mario make some 
incredible move or score some unbelievable goal. But when you see him play all 
the time and he's on your team, you are not surprised. You are just thankful 
that you can expect his greatness." 
</P>
<P>
What Brown is describing is routine brilliance. 
</P>
<P>
Routine brilliance. 
</P>
<P>
Those two words aren't compatible, because there is nothing humdrum about 
greatness. But it is within the domain of night-in and night-out performance 
that Lemieux has risen to such a consistent level that even at 23 he is 
knocking on the door of immortality. It is difficult to describe this 6-foot-4, 
215-pound skating octopus any other way. Lemieux's combination of size, reach, 
skill and strength handling the puck are unique. 
</P>
<P>
He's a playmaker with a feathery touch and field of vision second only to Wayne 
Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
He can work free in front of the net and unleash a sniper's bullet a la Phil 
Esposito in his prime. 
</P>
<P>
And he uses what seems like 15-foot rubber arms to control the puck and the 
tempo of the game like no one else in NHL history. 
</P>
<P>
"God only knows what's going to come from Mario Lemieux next," Edmonton's Craig 
Simpson said of his former Penguins teammate. 
</P>
<P>
"When Gretzky broke 200 points and went on to set the record (215 points in 
1985-86), everybody wondered if it would ever be broken," Hartford Whalers 
President and General Manager Emile Francis said. "Forget in Gretzky's 
lifetime. Lemieux might do it while Wayne's still in his prime." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in his NHL career, the critics complained the kid didn't care enough. 
He didn't have enough heart. He was two zones away while his team was on 
defense. He turned it on and off as his mood hit and, like the Penguins, folded 
down the stretch. All that has changed the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
"Wayne Gretzky taught Mario how to win," said Mr. Hockey, Gordie Howe. "In my 
mind, Mario became a hockey player at last year's Canada Cup. Before he was a 
talent, a great talent. But he was weak defensively and didn't seem to be 
involved at all times. Now, he's damn near as good a hockey player as Wayne is. 
</P>
<P>
"And he can do things that Wayne isn't physically able to do. The way he uses 
those arms and his strength to control the puck when it's about five feet away 
from him is unbelievable. That big son of a gun is something else." 
</P>
<P>
As much as the Universal Gretzky Adoration Society does not want to admit it, 
the time has come when Lemieux perhaps should no longer be held in comparison 
to Gretzky. At this point, Gretzky probably should be compared to Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
After being limited to one assist in a 2-2 tie in New Jersey on Friday, Lemieux 
entered Monday night's game against the Whalers at the Hartford Civic Center 
leading the NHL with 92 points (36 goals, 56 assists) in 33 games. If Lemieux 
doesn't miss any more games to injury, his 2.79-points-a-game pace would give 
him an NHL record 217 points. His goal pace is headed for 85, which would be 
second only to Gretzky's 92 goals in 1981-82. All those projections won't mean 
a hill of beans if Lemieux rips off another 41-point barrage like he did in the 
first 12 games of this season before missing a few games with a wrist injury. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to win the scoring title, with Gretzky (82 points), Bernie Nicholls 
(83) and myself there's a challenge," Lemieux said. "I want to be the best I 
can. But after a while all the Lemieux vs. Gretzky (comparisons) can get a 
little old. I'm sure Wayne feels the same way. I really admire him. But I want 
to be recognized as Mario Lemieux and judged on what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
"There's got to be some friendly competition between the two," Brown said. "But 
Mario hears it so much. Wouldn't you get tired of it, too?" 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that Gretzky served as a teacher in Lemieux's maturation process. 
Gretzky showed Lemieux the door to immortality, but Lemieux had to be the one 
to open it. 
</P>
<P>
At the 1987 Canada Cup, Lemieux played on Gretzky's wing. They pushed each 
other to a higher level. As Team Canada Coach Jean Perron said at the time, 
"Buckle up because we're going into hockey space." 
</P>
<P>
The two complemented each other. They challenged each other. Much of it was 
done not in words, but in the reflex actions of peerless talents. Lemieux 
scored 11 goals in nine games. Gretzky assisted on nine of them. 
</P>
<P>
For purists, the three-game Canada Cup series against the Soviets may well have 
been the greatest hockey ever played. And the riveting overtime thriller in 
Game 2 at Hamilton may have been the greatest single game in hockey history. 
Lemieux won it. Gretzky assisted. In the final minute of the decisive third 
game, Canada broke the deadlock. Goal Lemieux. Assist Gretzky. Match to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no denying how much winning at the Canada Cup meant to me," Lemieux 
said, criticized in the past for turning down invitations to the world 
championships after Pittsburgh had failed to make the NHL playoffs. "Wayne was 
terrific. It gave me confidence that I could play with the best in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Howe is big buddies with Gretzky. It would be a major upset for him to admit 
publicly that Lemieux is better. But others have said it. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, Mario Lemieux is the best player in the world," Detroit Coach 
Jacques Demers said. 
</P>
<P>
A Lemieux vs. Gretzky poll in the Whalers' locker room earlier this season 
showed that more players believed Lemieux's talent was No. 1, but that they'd 
still want Gretzky when it mattered most. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Liut said you don't surpass Gretzky. You can only match him. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Peterson said, "For the regular season, I'd take Lemieux. For the 
playoffs, I'd take Gretzky." 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux cannot be shocked by such talk. Even though Gretzky missed 16 games 
because of injury last season, Lemieux scored NHL highs of 70 goals and 168 
points to break Gretzky's run of eight Hart Trophies as league MVP. And his 
six-point performance in last year's All-Star Game in St. Louis was frightening 
in its dominance.

The Paris-Dakar rally moved into Sebha, the boyhood home of Libyan leader 
Moammar Kadafi, with Belgian Jacky Ickx holding the automobile lead and 
Spaniard Carlos Mas edging ahead in the motorcycle division. 
</P>
<P>
Upon reaching the checkpoint after a day's drive through the desert, exhausted 
rally drivers were greeted with promises from Kadafi for a special New Year's 
Eve day banquet for the racers and for permission to exclude the drivers and 
their support teams from the ban on alcohol in his Islamic society.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;

<P>
LOUISVILLE ROLLS OVER KENTUCKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Cornelius Holden knew Louisville fans were looking for a big victory over 
Kentucky Saturday. He and his teammates were more than happy to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
"People didn't just want us to beat them," Holden said. "They wanted us to blow 
them out." 
</P>
<P>
It might not have been a blowout, but the No. 14-ranked Cardinals used a 
balanced scoring attack and their superior depth to score a decisive 97-75 
victory at Louisville's Freedom Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville had not beaten Kentucky since a 71-64 victory in Freedom Hall Dec. 
15, 1984. The Wildcats, who had won the last 3 meetings, still hold a 14-6 
series advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"The victory is a step in the right direction because we finished December 
undefeated," said Pervis Ellison, who led Louisville with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville's reserves, paced by Everick Sullivan with 15 points, outscored 
Kentucky's reserves, 31-3, as the Cardinals (7-2) won their seventh straight 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville Coach Denny Crum said his ability to send in fresh players at will 
forced Kentucky (5-7) into an up-tempo game. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing we wanted them to do was to run and shoot in an 
up-tempo game," Crum said. "We took advantage of our depth and got good play 
off our bench." 
</P>
<P>
Consecutive 3-point shots by Derrick Miller pulled Kentucky to within 54-43 
with 1:43 left, but Louisville scored 11 of the next 14 points to put the game 
out of reach, 65-46, at the 11:20 mark. Kentucky never got closer than 12. 
</P>
<P>
Miller led Kentucky with 34 points, including 5 3-pointers. Freshman scored 13 
points for the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri 96, Morgan State 66 -- Lee Coward scored 7 points and Gary Leonard 
added 4 during a 20-2 run that gave the Tigers a 36-13 lead with 5:18 remaining 
in the first half, and No. 11 Missouri went on to rout the Bears at Columbia, 
Mo. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard, a senior center whose previous career high was 17 points, led the 
Tigers (12-3) with 23. Morgan State's James McCoy led all scorers with 27 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan State (4-5) was outrebounded, 44-28. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas Little Rock 89, Marshall 79 -- Johnnie Bell scored 20 points and had 
13 rebounds to lead the Trojans past the Thundering Herd in the championship 
game of the Arkansas Little Rock tournament at Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans were ahead, 66-50, with 11 minutes left when Marshall mounted a 
comeback to pull within 82-76 with 1:29 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State 72, Clemson 58 -- The victory at Portland late Friday night gave 
the Beavers their second straight Far West tournament title. It was their 17th 
title in the tournament's 33-year history. 
</P>
<P>
The championship also was the seventh for Ralph Miller in his 19 seasons at 
Oregon State. Miller, 69, is retiring at the end of this season. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State (7-3) took the lead for good at 44-41 with 15:40 to play on one of 
Gary Payton's 4 3-point shots. The basket started an 18-9 run that gave the 
Beavers a 59-50 lead on another Payton 3-pointer with 7:26 left. 
</P>
<P>
Payton, a junior guard, scored 18 points, had 7 assists and was named the 
tournament MVP. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers are 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois 96, Hawaii 87 -- Senior guard Kenny Battle scored a career-high 29 
points and Nick Anderson added 26 as the No. 4 Illini remained unbeaten at 12-0 
by winning the Rainbow tournament late Friday night at Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
With 14:06 remaining in the game, Chris Gaines gave Hawaii a 60-58 lead when he 
scored on a fast-break layup. Anderson, who scored 18 of his points in the 
second half, then made a 3-point play with 13:48 to go, giving Illinois a lead 
it never relinquished. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii (7-4), which lost its first home game, was led by Reggie Cross with 24 
points. 
</P>
<P>
No. 17 Georgia Tech beat Purdue, 72-69, for third place.

Zola Budd says she would like to run again for Britain but that she never will 
denounce apartheid despite pressure from opponents of the racial separation 
laws of her native South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview telecast on Britain's ITV network, the former world champion 
middle-distance runner said that although her personal beliefs do not favor 
apartheid, she would refrain from public criticism of the South African regime 
or its policies. 
</P>
<P>
"I will never regret not denouncing apartheid," she said. "I have strong views 
about South African politics and I still don't feel I need to make public 
statements." 
</P>
<P>
Budd returned to South Africa from Britain last spring after anti-apartheid 
groups applied pressure to keep her from competing for her adopted country in 
the world cross-country championships in New Zealand.

STEROID REPORT A REVELATION TO CIF HIERARCHY; 
</P>
<P>
'EPIDEMIC' SURPRISES ADMINISTRATORS, COACHES

The heads of 2 commissions that oversee athletics in all public high schools in 
Southern California said that they were surprised by the findings of a recent 
national survey indicating that 1 of every 15 boys in 12th grade has used 
anabolic steroids. Both said that they have never received a report of a 
student using the muscle-building drug. 
</P>
<P>
But a national expert on drug abuse said that steroid use among high school 
students is rising sharply and is at epidemic levels in some Southern 
California communities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a frightening situation," said Dr. Forest S. Tennant of West Covina, a 
leader in the treatment of substance abuse. Tennant has treated many 
professional athletes for cocaine dependency, including former Dodger pitcher 
Steve Howe and NBA star Walter Davis. "I have seen blood-test results from 
users of anabolic steroids. I have been shocked to see the dramatic effects 
they have on the human body." 
</P>
<P>
Tennant, who operates a drug abuse treatment center in Van Nuys, said that his 
studies have shown steroids to have a dramatic impact on the adrenal gland and 
the immune system and to cause cholesterol levels to soar in most users. 
</P>
<P>
A study published last month in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., 
purported to be the first nationwide survey of steroid use among high school 
boys, found that of the 3,403 seniors interviewed at 46 schools, 6.6% of them 
said that they were using or had used steroids. Most said that they took the 
drug to enhance their athletic performance, but 26.7% were non-athletes who 
said that they used steroids to build muscles and improve their physical 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Thomas, the commissioner of the of the California Interscholastic 
Federation Southern Section -- which oversees more than 500 schools -- said 
that his organization has never had a report of steroid use by a local high 
school athlete. 
</P>
<P>
"None. Not a single report," Thomas said. "But I am certain it goes on. It's 
like marijuana use in your high school. You'd be crazy to say it doesn't go on. 
It's the same thing with steroids. 
</P>
<P>
"But I am just overwhelmed to hear those numbers. The numbers are scary." 
</P>
<P>
Hal Harkness, the director of interscholastic athletics for the City Section -- 
which oversees 49 Los Angeles School District programs -- said that he knows of 
no incidents involving steroid use by athletes in city schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I have had no calls about it, ever," he said. "I have heard absolutely no 
comments in over two years in this position from anyone in our schools 
regarding steroids." 
</P>
<P>
Tennant said that the reason for the lack of reports on steroid use by students 
is that coaches and administrators don't know what they're looking for. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are waiting to get reports on steroid use like they get reports of 
kids using marijuana or cocaine, then they will never get any reports," Tennant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Steroids are not taken in that manner, at lunchtime or at smoke break at 
school. Steroids are taken in a very programmed way, at a very intentional time 
and place, most likely away from the school. Users of cocaine and marijuana 
take those drugs when they are passed to them." 
</P>
<P>
The study reported that more than one-third of the seniors who said they have 
taken steroids took them both orally and by injection. Only one-fifth of those 
who claimed to use steroids said they got the drugs from a health-care 
professional. The majority obtained the steroids from other athletes, coaches 
and people who frequent gyms, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
Tennant said that he began to see widespread steroid use among adolescents 4 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The figures in the national study just released are not only believable, but 
in Southern California I think they are higher than that," he said. "It is 
spotty. In some communities people have never seen or heard about anabolic 
steroids. In others, it's an epidemic. As long as four years ago, I had 
substantiated reports of parents and coaches giving steroids to Little League 
baseball players and Pop Warner football players. 
</P>
<P>
"This study is a validation of something I have seen for the last four years. I 
support what it said and I agree with its findings." 
</P>
<P>
Tennant was especially alarmed at the reasons some steroid users gave for 
taking the drug. 
</P>
<P>
"The most frightening aspect of steroid use is that adolescents are using them 
to alter their basic physical appearance," he said. "They perceive that doing 
that will make them more sexually attractive or give them some success in life 
that they can't achieve otherwise. It symbolizes something that has gone sour 
in our society, that our natural body and our natural talents are not worthy 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Redell, a veteran high school football coach who recently resigned from 
his post at Crespi High, said that he encountered only 1 player at Crespi whom 
he suspected of using steroids. But he said that the results of the national 
study are not unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't surprise me a bit to see those numbers," said Redell, who also 
played and coached in the defunct U. S. Football League. "The pressure on the 
kids today to win, and to perform well, is greater than ever. There are parents 
who pressure their own kids into taking steroids, not only not condemning 
steroid use but actually encouraging it. The pressure is to gain major college 
scholarships." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon High Coach Harry Welch, who has run the Valley-area's most successful 
football program for the past 7 years, said that he has never encountered 
steroid use among his players. 
</P>
<P>
"We discuss drugs but I haven't discussed steroids because I've never seen the 
need," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Welch added that he condemns steroid use, equating it with so-called 
recreational drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"It really scares me," he said. "I've read that it affects the reproductive 
system. To even flirt with using something that could affect your sexual 
identity or the future of your children . . . I would condemn it in the 
harshest way." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland High Coach Steve Landress found it difficult to believe the 
statistics, saying that he has never heard of high school athletes -- or 
students -- using steroids during his 13 years of coaching. 
</P>
<P>
He especially ruled out athletes, saying top players have no need for such 
drugs at the high school level. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys who are Division I-type players are so much better than other players 
they don't need it," he said. "Even a few years ago when it wasn't such a big 
thing to say you used steroids, I never heard anyone talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said that the Southern Section has never discussed the issue of steroids 
with coaches and has never sent memos to coaches informing them of indications 
of steroid use by players. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we felt it should be common sense," Thomas said. "If a kid goes from 
165 pounds to 205 pounds in six months, a coach should have a clue that 
steroids might be involved. I guess we assumed they would know. But I'm not 
satisfied anymore with where we are with this issue. We have to do more." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, however, said that the Southern Section has no firm plan to deal with 
steroid use. He said that the organization is involved in an educational 
program sponsored by the Los Angeles Amateur Athletic Foundation and is 
participating in another steroid awareness program sponsored by the Orange 
County Sheriff's Deparment. 
</P>
<P>
"We have run articles about steroid use in our football game programs," Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Testing players for steroids has never been seriously considered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly have to admit we have been remiss in the world of drug abuse," 
Thomas said. "Drugs are a problem in our high schools in general, but the CIF 
Southern Section should take a leadership role (against) drug abuse, including 
the use of steroids." 
</P>
<P>
Harkness said that the City Section may implement a steroid awareness program 
early next year. There will be no drug testing, however. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not even consider voluntary drug testing," he said. "To begin with, 
voluntary testing is not effective. Those individuals who even think they might 
test positively for steroids simply won't volunteer for the testing. And 
mandatory testing is absolutely out of the question. We just don't have the 
right to do that and it wouldn't even be considered." 
</P>
<P>
Tennant said that the solution is a massive and immediate educational program. 
</P>
<P>
"The educational pitch is simple," he said. "No. 1, sports are here only to 
spend a little time in your young years competing, learning team spirit and 
discipline and fitness and competition. Anabolic steroids just don't have a 
place in that. They don't belong, and don't use them. Ever. They will hurt you. 
</P>
<P>
"And we have to repeat that message to our kids, over and over. Repetition. 
That's how we got people to wear seat belts and to brush their teeth and to 
lose weight. You keep giving them this message, again and again: Don't use 
steroids."

BASKETBALL RACE SHAPES UP AS RERUN; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENDING CHAMPIONS VENTURA, SANTA MONICA FAVORED IN REALIGNED WSC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Santa Monica and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
That is the answer, which comes without hesitation, from Western State 
Conference basketball coaches asked to name the favorites in this season's race 
for the WSC title. 
</P>
<P>
"Those two are head and shoulders above everyone else in the conference 
talent-wise," Glendale Coach Brian Beauchemin said. "Everybody else is right 
there together." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica and Ventura shared the championship last season with 11-2 records, 
and no one affiliated with the conference is bold enough to predict that it 
might not be a similar scenario this time around. 
</P>
<P>
The WSC has been slightly realigned after the defection of Allan Hancock 
College to the Central Valley Conference and the entry of Valley and West Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Valley, which played in the Southern California Conference last season, and 
West L. A. will join the South Division, which also includes Santa Monica, 
Canyons, Glendale and Bakersfield. The North Division comprises Ventura, 
Moorpark, Cuesta, Santa Barbara and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Coach John McMullen grudgingly admits that his Corsairs may be the 
team to beat. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose on our preseason record and returning lettermen that's the case," 
said McMullen, whose team is 15-3 and has won the Rancho Santiago, Compton, 
Merced and Pasadena tournaments. "If that's true, we're not that far ahead of 
anybody else. I've seen Valley, Canyons, Moorpark and Glendale, and they're all 
competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, all of the Valley-area teams have tasted success during the 
preconference schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons (9-8), though plagued by inconsistency, has looked spectacular at 
times. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars finished 8-5 in the WSC last season and made the playoffs for the 
fourth year in a row. This season, they finished second in the Glendale 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Smelser, in his 20th season as coach at Canyons, said the WSC likely will 
be one of the best conferences in the state. Whether his team will be among the 
best in the conference, however, will depend on its ability to eliminate 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a manner of transition, trying to be halfway decent and struggling," 
said Smelser, whose team opens WSC play Tuesday at West L. A. "We haven't been 
able to put the whole package together. That's been kind of frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
For a variety of reasons, Glendale (9-6) lost 4 players -- potentially, a 
strong nucleus -- from a young team that finished 6-7 in the WSC last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros, who open WSC play Wednesday at Santa Monica, are once again a 
young outfit, but the team has shown steady improvement despite its youth. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing all right considering what happened," said Beauchemin, who is in 
his 10th season with the Vaqueros. "The players are starting to respond." 
</P>
<P>
Valley (10-6), which joins the WSC after competing in the Southern California 
Conference, has a talented team led by center Oral Elrington and could give 
some teams trouble if the Monarchs are able to develop depth. Valley's first 
test comes Wednesday at Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark (8-7 entering the weekend), though dominated by freshmen, should 
improve steadily under Al Nordquist, who is in his 22nd season with the 
Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Roger Thomas, a freshman from Leuzinger High, is averaging 10.9 
points a game to lead the Raiders. Moorpark opens its conference schedule 
Wednesday at home against Cuesta. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard, which finished 1-12 last season, is the most improved team in the WSC. 
Santa Barbara won its own tournament and also is considered a conference dark 
horse. 
</P>
<P>
But in a conference with Santa Monica and Ventura, every team is a long-shot to 
displace the reigning co-champions. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura (13-2 entering the weekend) might have lost conference MVP Cedric 
Ceballos, but the Pirates have been buoyed by the play of all-conference point 
guard Tony Walker, who is averaging 9.6 assists, and freshman forward Reggie 
Betton, who is averaging 13.9 points. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, which opens WSC play Wednesday at Santa Barbara, has won the Cypress 
and Ventura tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica has 7 players back from a team that lost to Merced in the 
quarterfinals of the state tournament last season, including All-WSC forward 
Keith Amerson, forwards Von Shuler and Kemo Patrick and guards DeShawn Pullard 
and Troy Batiste, all of whom average more than 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks to me as if this is one of the strongest conferences overall in 
Southern California," McMullen said. "I feel that everybody has a team that can 
beat anybody else on a given night."

FACES TO WATCH NEXT SEASON: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HIGH SCHOOLS 
</P>
<P>
Chris Alexander, Hawthorne track -- The state's dominant track team continues 
to produce blue-chip talent. The latest could be Alexander, who was on the 
state champion relays last June as a freshman. He also plays football, but a 
broken arm ended his season early. 
</P>
<P>
Piper Hahn and Kristal Attwood, Mira Costa volleyball -- Mira Costa bowed out 
in the CIF 5-A finals, but then this was a rebuilding year with an entirely 
underclass lineup. Hahn figures to be one of the top prep players in the nation 
next year, with Attwood not far behind. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Clover, Rolling Hills basketball -- The junior guard has blossomed into 
one of the Southland's top 3-point shooters and will be a coveted college 
recruit next year when he will be out of John Hardy's shadow. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Leslie, Morningside basketball -- College coaches will have to wait for 
the next dominating center, because she'll only be a high school senior next 
year. The 6-foot-5 Monarch is already rated in the top handful of female 
players in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Nkosi Littleton, Carson football -- The Colts' all-star defensive tackle may be 
the most athletic lineman around next year. The only non-senior on the All-City 
first team, the 6-2, 210-pound junior is also one of the school's best 
basketball players. 
</P>
<P>
John Ma'ae and Derek Sparks, Banning football -- Opponents have to cringe at 
the thought of quarterback Ma'ae, who will be a three-year starter, handing off 
to the powerful running back Sparks, who emerged this year as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNITY COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
Marcel Bridges, Harbor College football -- It was difficult for a receiver to 
stand out in Harbor's offense, but the talented freshman earned all-conference 
honors and all-state honorable mention. Now if the Seahawks can only find a 
quarterback. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Frank Dolce, El Camino College football -- El Camino has been "Quarterbacks R 
Us" for most of the decade, and Dolce will return with some impressive stats. 
Most impressive -- he led the Warriors to their second straight PONY Bowl 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Haro, El Camino College soccer -- The L.A. high school player of the year 
wasted no time establishing himself on the community college level, leading the 
Warriors to the Southern California Conference title while earning SCC Player 
of the Year honors. 
</P>
<P>
UNIVERSITIES 
</P>
<P>
Devon Akita, Dominguez Hills volleyball/basketball -- Two programs trying to 
establish themselves are counting on the 5-7 sophomore. She may have the talent 
to earn all-conference honors in both sports. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Barksdale, Dominguez Hills basketball -- In Dick Vitale slang, the Toro 
sophomore guard is a "Dow Joneser" -- up and down. But by the time he's a 
senior the 6-foot-1 Barksdale could be the best shooting point guard in school 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Miah Bradbury, Mike McNary and Tim Williams, Loyola Marymount baseball -- The 
Lions have had a string of All-Americans in recent years, and this trio is 
bidding to join them. Bradbury, a strong-armed, heavy-hitting catcher, was one 
of the hitting stars of the NCAA Regionals last spring. McNary, a poised 
sophomore right-hander, toils in lefty Steve Surico's shadow but figures to be 
a staff mainstay. Line drives jump off the bat of Williams, also a sophomore, 
who is looking for a home either at first or in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Donlon, Loyola Marymount volleyball -- The Lions' men's team is trying to 
turn the corner, and Donlon may be the cornerstone in becoming more 
competitive. The 6-6 sophomore may be Loyola's best player since Olympian Paul 
Sunderland in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Flanagan, Dominguez Hills soccer -- The Toro forward was outshined this 
year by the scoring of transfer Willie Ayala -- who also returns -- but 
Flanagan figures to end his senior year leading the Toros in virtually every 
career offensive category. 
</P>
<P>
Terrell Lowery, Loyola Marymount basketball -- Hank Gathers, Bo Kimble and Jeff 
Fryer figure to be filling up the basket again next season, but the key man in 
Paul Westhead's offense is the point guard, and the slender freshman figures to 
be the one getting them the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Kristi White, Dominguez Hills soccer -- The midfielder has earned post-season 
honors for the Toros, but Coach Marine Cano is still waiting for her to develop 
the scoring touch he anticipated. If she blossoms as a senior, the Toros could 
have a devastating attack. ALAN DROOZ

GRANADA HILLS SCOUT RATES FOOTBALL PROSPECTS TO PROVIDE SHOPPING ASSISTANCE BY

<P>
Foster Andersen at a high school football game: He draws a bead on an offensive 
lineman's feet. Are they quick feet? Or slow feet? Then he focuses on a 
defensive back's hips. How fast can they switch gears from forward to reverse? 
Next, he zeroes in on a receiver's hands. Soft or hard? And the quarterback's 
arm. How strong? 
</P>
<P>
To Andersen, winning isn't everything, anatomy is. Every week during the 
football season, he sees a minimum of 3 high school and 2 junior college games. 
He doesn't care about results. He doesn't root. He just scrutinizes hands and 
feet and hips and arms and puts all the body parts together to form a 
well-rounded opinion of a player. 
</P>
<P>
As the owner of Sports Search, a scouting service he runs out of his Granada 
Hills home, Andersen judges football prospects and sells his evaluations to 
major colleges such as USC, UCLA and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
This past season, he and 2 associates analyzed the college potential of 400 
high school and 400 junior college players in the vast football caldron of 
Southern California. That's a lot of body parts. 
</P>
<P>
"But I never get tired of going to games," says Andersen, 48, a two-way lineman 
for UCLA in the early 1960s and former head coach at Cal State L. A. "It's the 
parking that bugs me." 
</P>
<P>
Scouting services such as Andersen's are in vogue -- USC subscribes to about 50 
-- because the NCAA has tightened the screws on recruiting. As of this year, 
colleges cannot even scout a prospect until Nov. 1. To cover ground quickly and 
thoroughly, they buy reports from scouting services, which rate the best 
players. Andersen sells his service for as much as $800 a year for voluminous 
compilations or as little as $75 for, say, a breakdown on quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Our reports allow a college staff to prioritize its time," Andersen says. "We 
tell them who they should concentrate on and who's a waste of time." 
</P>
<P>
The fear of missing a blue-chip player also drives colleges to subscribe to 
scouting services. "We cross-reference players rated by the various services," 
says USC recruiting coordinator Jack Himebauch. 
</P>
<P>
Andersen assigns a rating to each player he scouts. The best is a 1+, which 
represents "the guys I'd want if I were coach at USC or UCLA," he says. Players 
rated as a 1 or 1- are Division I caliber. A 2+ would be the best player 
available for Division II schools. Of the 400 high school players he has 
evaluated this year, "150 are capable of playing in Division I and maybe 30 are 
rated 1+," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But his ratings are not chiseled in stone. Colleges use scouting services as an 
aid, not a directive, often disagreeing with or ignoring their recommendations. 
"Coaches still make their own evaluations," Himebauch says. "They don't rely on 
somebody else's opinion to offer a player a scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Andersen says he was pushing Jack Swan of El Camino Royal High as 
"the best offensive lineman in the Valley." But neither USC nor UCLA recruited 
him, Andersen says, because at 6-3, he was shorter than their prototype 
lineman. But one of Sports Search's subscribers, the University of Georgia, 
gave Swan a scholarship and "think they stole him out of Southern California," 
Andersen says. 
</P>
<P>
Andersen puts all his information in an IBM computer in the family room of his 
ranch house. Players are listed alphabetically and by position. Aside from 
ratings, Andersen includes capsule comments on each player, "little bits of 
information coaches like." Typing on the computer keyboard -- "I had to learn 
to type to go into this business," he says -- Andersen called up Hart High 
tight end Brian Allen. The comment read: 
</P>
<P>
"Catches with hands. Doesn't look like he'll fill out for different positions 
because of body type." 
</P>
<P>
Andersen explained, "Coaches don't necessarily like receivers who catch the 
ball against their pads, and they also want to know if a prospect has the 
potential to play other positions," such as offensive or defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
In the analysis of Crespi running back Russell White, Andersen mentioned that 
he could also be "a great defensive back." White, of course, got Andersen's 
highest rating despite nagging injuries and a "weak offensive line" this 
season. "I watched him in practice," Andersen says, "and his work ethic is 
very, very good." 
</P>
<P>
But who is the best back in the L. A. area? Andersen likes Hawthorne 
quarterback Curtis Conway, projecting him as a college tailback. Andersen's 
computer comment says Conway "may be the next Marcus Allen." 
</P>
<P>
An assistant coach at USC under Ted Tollner, Andersen was out of a job when 
Larry Smith brought in his own assistants 2 years ago. So Andersen, along with 
computer expert Dick Laugens, started Sports Search, hiring former USC 
assistants Larry Bryan and Nate Shaw to help with the scouting. They specialize 
in Southern California players "because California supplies 15% of the players 
in Division I," Andersen says. 
</P>
<P>
Andersen has opinions on where to find the best players in the area. "Banning 
and Carson have the premier concentration of athletes in public schools," he 
says. "In private schools, it's Loyola and Crespi. They have good coaches and 
an administration that wants football to be a unifying force on campus." 
</P>
<P>
Andersen says that San Fernando High has the best talent in the Valley this 
year and Orange County "is where you'll find the great linemen." Inner-city 
schools, he says, "traditionally produce great running backs and receivers." 
</P>
<P>
Andersen sometimes disagrees with all-star teams, which he says are based on 
"politics." For instance, the Golden League put defensive lineman Sean McCune 
of Canyon High on its second team. "I think he'd leave some of the first team 
in the dirt," Andersen says. He gave Granada Hills defensive lineman Anthony 
Hall a 1+ but Hall didn't make All-North Valley League. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 1988 season is behind him, Andersen will not be taking it easy 
until the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Scouting is a full-time, year-round job. "We're working on our spring list -- 
juniors in high school," he says. So he will be attending spring practices -- 
and watching lots of body parts.

With apologies to David Letterman, we offer lists detailing what happened in 
1988 and, in some cases, how 1988 will impact 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven reasons the Padres' 1989 season will be different from 1988: 
</P>
<P>
1. They won't have to worry about a club president making an obscene gesture to 
the fans on Fan Appreciation Night. 
</P>
<P>
First, the Padres no longer have a club president. Chub Feeney resigned last 
fall within hours of wagging an obscene right-hand gesture at some heckling 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
Second, Feeney has reportedly moved back to the comforts of San Francisco, 
where his gesture is the social equivalent of a handshake. 
</P>
<P>
Third, if club officials are smart, they will hold this year's fan appreciation 
activities during an afternoon game. Even if Feeney chooses to fly down for an 
encore, he'll probably be napping at that hour if last year's routine is any 
indication. 
</P>
<P>
2. They won't have to worry about a manager engaging in a fist fight with any 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bowa is gone. Stanley Jefferson is gone. 
</P>
<P>
And the last person dumb enough to mess with Jack McKeon, Bowa's replacement, 
still has the cigar burns to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
3. They won't have to worry about firing a manager at 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
It worked with Bowa, who was canned on May 28 in New York while still in his 
pajamas. But it won't work with McKeon. Virtually every day on the road at 7 
a.m., he's in church. Considering the erratic history of Padre management, 
that's not a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
4. They won't have to worry about losing a starting third baseman for 3 days 
with a bruised tooth root. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Brown is gone. 
</P>
<P>
Come to think of it, the Padres also won't have to worry about losing a 
starting third baseman for a week because he twisted his heel walking off the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Or worry about losing a starting third baseman for a week because he hurt his 
thumb sucker-punching one of the club's reserve outfielders (Marvell Wynne). 
</P>
<P>
Or worry about losing a starting third baseman for 5 minutes during the middle 
of the game because of a broken jockstrap. 
</P>
<P>
Where did Chris Brown go? 
</P>
<P>
Does it matter? 
</P>
<P>
5. They won't have to worry about their home-run hitter turning a cartwheel 
after a home run. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Moreland is gone, having been shipped with Brown to Detroit. In Detroit, 
the players turn cartwheels following every home run, delighted that they have 
just trotted 360 feet in public without being shot. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' new home run hitter, Jack Clark, turned his first and last 
cartwheel when he found he was being traded here from the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Jack McKeon was dumb enough to try a cartwheel just once, and he has the cigar 
burns to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
6. They won't have to worry about any frustrated manager or fan wanting to tear 
Jimmy Jones' face off. 
</P>
<P>
The mild-mannered and erratic starting pitcher has been traded to the New York 
Yankees. The latest New York Post insta-poll says his face won't make it to the 
All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
7. They won't have to worry about pitcher Andy Hawkins' shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins became a free agent and signed with the New York Yankees for about 
double what he would have been paid in San Diego, partially because the Padres 
were worried about a right shoulder that caused him trouble in 1987 and may 
have hindered him late in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In his first press conference as a Yankee, he said he was looking forward to 
moving out of San Diego and settling his wife and family in New York. The 
Yankees aren't worried about his shoulder -- they are worried about his head.

AMERICA'S CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With apologies to David Letterman, we offer lists detailing what happened in 
1988 and, in some cases, how 1988 will impact 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven reasons why the 1988 America's Cup defense was a farce: 
</P>
<P>
1. It did not occur to New Zealand's Michael Fay that Stars &amp; Stripes would 
be a catamaran. 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand had made its surprise challenge in a 90-foot monohull in July 1987, 
assuming Sail America would respond in kind. 
</P>
<P>
The Kiwi challenge, based on a literal interpretation of the America's Cup Deed 
of Gift, was upheld in the New York Supreme Court in November 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But the same literal interpretation of the Deed of Gift caused Sail America to 
respond with the catamaran. 
</P>
<P>
2. San Diego, home of the San Diego Yacht Club, was left hanging for months on 
whether the 1988 races would be held off the San Diego coast. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the City of San Diego was actually rebuffed in court in an 
attempt to assert its right to be a party to the competition. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, on Jan. 22, Sail America announced that the races would be held off 
either Long Beach or Hawaii. In March, Sail America finally announced that the 
races would be off the San Diego coast in September. 
</P>
<P>
3. Michael Fay complained about Stars &amp; Stripes' commercialism. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the Marlboro logo on Stars &amp; Stripes, New Zealand hoisted a 
sail that said: "Surgeon General's Warning: Quitting Smoking Now Greatly 
Reduces Serious Risks to Your Health" in the days leading up to the first race. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, Stars &amp; Stripes skipper Dennis Conner was race commodore for an 
American Cancer Society regatta. 
</P>
<P>
4. Michael Fay whined and complained about how horrible this mismatch was going 
to be. 
</P>
<P>
For months and months, he complained. 
</P>
<P>
Encountering a couple of women bicyclists near the Kiwi compound, he said: "Do 
you ladies know what this race will be like? Why, it will be like you two 
racing your bicycles against motorbikes." 
</P>
<P>
Just before the racing, Fay announced the results of a Kiwi-commissioned Gallup 
Poll which concluded that 53% of Americans thought the race was unfair. 
</P>
<P>
He did not make a big issue of the fact that 51% of Americans polled were 
unaware of any such controversy. 
</P>
<P>
5. The races were horrible mismatches. 
</P>
<P>
Stars &amp; Stripes won the first race by 18 minutes 15 seconds on Sept. 7 and 
concluded a sweep of the best-of-three series with a 21-minute 10-second 
victory 2 days later. 
</P>
<P>
6. Sportsmanship was as horrible as the competition. 
</P>
<P>
The Kiwis accused Conner of intentionally sandbagging to keep the margin of 
victory from being even greater than it was. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider what they did to be disgraceful," skipper David Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
"They should have gone out there and beaten us by 1 1/2 to 2 hours," designer 
Bruce Farr said. 
</P>
<P>
That was after the first race. After the second race, a press conference turned 
into a literal and verbal shoving match with grown men called each other liars 
and losers. 
</P>
<P>
7. It's not over. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, Michael Fay went back to the New York Supreme Court to ask that the 
race be forfeited to New Zealand because of how unfair it was that his monohull 
had to race against a catamaran. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, the outcome of this continuing legal hassle will provide a farcical 
beginning to 1989. DAVE DISTEL

SOCKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS ELLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With apologies to David Letterman, we offer lists detailing what happened in 
1988 and, in some cases, how 1988 will impact 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Six steps that made the Sockers' spring and summer seem like a walk through 
the Twilight Zone, or the Museum of the Hard-To-Believe: 
</P>
<P>
1. There's a sign post up ahead, and your next stop is ... 
</P>
<P>
The first indication this would not be a typical year came April 25. Ron 
Fowler, the chairman of Sockers' Management Inc., filed for protection from 
creditors in a Federal Bankruptcy Court under Chapter 11. This action came 
despite the Sockers' status as one of the most successful franchises in league 
history. 
</P>
<P>
2. They come back, but Segota goes. 
</P>
<P>
In Game 7 of the Western Division finals on May 28, Branko Segota, the Sockers' 
leading scorer, injured his shoulder and was lost for the remainder of the 
playoffs. The Sockers advanced to the MISL Championship Series against the 
Cleveland Force without him, beating the Kansas City Comets, 8-5. 
</P>
<P>
There was a sign the Kansas City series would be bizarre in Game 3, when the 
Sockers blew a 6-1 lead in the fourth quarter and lost in overtime, 7-6. Kansas 
City had a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series before the Sockers rallied. 
</P>
<P>
3. Break up the Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
The great all-star Sockers team of the 1980s played its last game together on 
June 7 and produced a 7-4 victory over Cleveland, wrapping up a four-game sweep 
of the MISL Championship Series and a sixth title in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Because of salary cutbacks, it was apparent that players such as Segota, Juli 
Veee, Hugo Perez, Kevin Crow, Fernando Clavijo, Zoltan Toth and Jim Gorsek 
would not all be able to come back for another season. 
</P>
<P>
But Cleveland saw the Sockers at their best in the final game. Waad Hirmez 
notched a hat trick, and Perez broke a 4-4 tie with 3:34 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
4. Fowler makes his bid ... 
</P>
<P>
After it became obvious that nobody else was interested in buying the 
franchise, Fowler announced an offer to buy it out of bankruptcy for $825,000 
on June 17. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler's bid was eventually lowered to $470,000. He will also threatened to 
withdraw it on June 29. 
</P>
<P>
5. . . . but on second thought . . . 
</P>
<P>
On the morning of July 8, Fowler arrived in court and was told by local 
reporter that the Tacoma Stars and Chicago Sting had folded, leaving the league 
with seven franchises. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler, who maintained all along that the league must have at least eight 
franchises to exist, called a press conference that afternoon and announced 
that soccer in San Diego was pretty much dead. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a week later, a group in Tacoma announced that it was going to try 
and re-start the Stars. So Fowler kept his offer alive. 
</P>
<P>
Tacoma was eventually re-started, but Cleveland folded on July 22. After a 
weekend's worth of meetings, the league decided to try another season with 
seven teams. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler, who had come this far, elected to stick it out, and his second bid is 
accepted by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Peter W. Bowie on July 29. 
</P>
<P>
6. Back to soccer. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 5, after the team's most tumultuous off-season, the Sockers opened 
their 1988-89 season against the Los Angeles Lazers. Gone were Gorsek, Hirmez, 
Veee, Perez, Clavijo, Brian Schmetzer, Raffaele Ruotolo and Jacques Ladouceur. 
</P>
<P>
As if to put on exclamation point on the summer's activities, ex-Sockers Hirmez 
and Gorsek led the Lazers to a 5-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 22, the Sockers signed Steve Zungul, the top scorer in the history of 
the game. Reunited with Segota, Zungul goes on a scoring spree (six goals in 
his first six games) and the Sockers are 7-7 going into the New Year. CHRIS

With apologies to David Letterman, we offer lists detailing what happened in 
1988 and, in some cases, how 1988 will impact 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything else you wanted to know about but were afraid to ask: 
</P>
<P>
1. A Pair for Pate. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Pate thought San Diego was a great golf town. 
</P>
<P>
On windy Sunday Jan. 17, after three delays because of rain and one because of 
hail, the Tournament of Champions was called off, and Pate was declared the 
winner after 54 holes at La Costa. Pate was awarded the $90,000 first prize for 
his 14-under-par score of 202, one stroke better than Larry Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 21, Pate sank a 6-foot putt for a birdie on the final hole for a 
1-stroke victory over Jay Haas in the Shearson Lehman Hutton Andy Williams Open 
at Torrey Pines Golf Course. Pate became only the second golfer to win the San 
Diego double -- the T of C and the Andy Williams. (Tom Watson did it in 1980.) 
Pate's putt gave him a final round of 68 and a 72-hole total of 19-under par 
269. 
</P>
<P>
Pate also will be the last Andy Williams winner. After a 21-year affiliation, 
the Century Club of San Diego announced Nov. 22 that Williams has ended his 
involvement as host of the tournament. It will now be known as the Shearson 
Lehman Hutton Open. 
</P>
<P>
2. The meet belongs to Olympians. 
</P>
<P>
A host of track and field stars showed up at the Michelob Invitational outdoor 
track meet in June. 
</P>
<P>
Double Olympic gold medalist Jackie Joyner-Kersee took just three long jumps. 
Two were fouls, but her first -- 24 feet 3 inches -- was just 2 1/2 inches 
short of her American record. After competing, Joyner-Kersee attended the 
wedding of UCLA's Gail Devers, formerly of Sweetwater, and Ron Roberts, a 
former Bruin distance runner. 
</P>
<P>
Florence Griffith Joyner -- Flo Jo -- gave an indication of Olympic glory to 
come, winning the 100 meters in 10.89 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Decker Slaney had an easy time in the 2,000 meters, winning in 5 minutes 
36.35 seconds. Ramona Pagel became the first American woman to surpass 20 
meters in the shot put with a throw of 66-2 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
3. And the rest of the story. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Joan Hansen, a Solana Beach distance runner, decided not to try to compete 
in her second Olympics in 1988, opting instead to help start the San Diego 
National Athletes Fund, a nonprofit corporation designed to raise money for 
local athletes in training. In '84, Hansen ran in the 3,000-meter race with 
Mary Decker. Both fell, but few knew about Hansen because of the controversy 
surrounding Decker, who didn't finish. Hansen did, placing eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Major League Volleyball was a major league bust in May. Just 254 fans 
showed up for a match between the New York Liberties and the Chicago Breeze. 
The Breeze won. The MLV lost. The paltry attendance figures didn't entice San 
Diego investors to support a team here. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In June, it was announced that San Diego State and USD would not play each 
other in men's basketball for the first time in 9 years. The rivalry was put on 
hold for a year because the two schools could not agree on a date. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An estimated 3,000 athletes descended on San Diego to participate in 13 
sports at 25 venues in the inaugural California State Games in mid July. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the men's open division championship of the 35th Over-the-Line 
tournament at Fiesta Island July 17, the Beachcomber team of Steve Miner, Billy 
Bright and John Torchia came out of the loser's bracket to defeat the Pennant 
Pups for the title. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Christy Erb of Bonita and Kevin Kemp of Greensboro, N.C. won the girls' and 
boys' 15-17 divisions of the Optimist Junior World Golf Championships at Torrey 
Pines July 22. 
</P>
<P>
 -- With 8 seconds to play and the game tied, 14-14, Torrey Pines fullback Tim 
Walker kicked a 39-yard field goal to give the San Diego Section All-Stars a 
17-14 victory over the Los Angeles City Section team at Mesa College July 30. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Roger Gunn of Napa won the Buie San Diego County Open with a 6-under-par-66 
on the North Course at Torrey Pines Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stephanie Rehe breezed by Ann Grossman, 6-1, 6-1, to win the Virginia Slims 
of San Diego singles title Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Some top names were missing Aug. 12, but after a 4-year hiatus, the NBA 
returned to the San Diego Sports Arena for an all-star game that included 
former Aztec Michael Cage and Morse High alumnus Cliff Levingston (35 points, 
MVP). 
</P>
<P>
 -- A local all-star team returned home in mid August after winning the 
International Boys' Baseball Friendship Tournament in Bejing, China. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Dodd, who attended SDSU, and Tim Hovland won $50,000 in the Cuervo 
Gold Crown volleyball series Sept. 17 at Mission Bay's Mariner's Point. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two drivers in the championship race of the Miller High Life Thunderboat 
Regatta at Mission Bay Sept. 18 escaped serious injury when the 
turbine/jet-powered hydroplanes boats they were racing flipped over and broke 
apart after being launched by a gust of wind. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wayne Gretzky had a goal and an assist for the Los Angeles Kings, who lost, 
5-4, to the Winnipeg Jets in an exhibition before a sellout crowd of 13,155 at 
the Sports Arena Sept. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut was the first gymnast inducted into the 
International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in Oceanside on Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rockers Bobby Blotzer of Ratt, "Motor City Madman" Ted Nugent and Tommy Lee 
of Motley Crue finished 1-2-3 in the Dodge International Star Challenge car 
race on Oct. 22 at the Del Mar Fairgrounds. The next day, Tom Hessert won the 
championship race of the Camel Grand Prix of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Former world record-holder and 2-time Olympian Tom Petranoff of Oceanside, 
along with several other track and field athletes, was suspended indefinitely 
by The Athletics Congress for participation in a series of meets in South 
Africa. TAC serves as the U.S. agent of the International Amateur Athletic 
Federation, which does not sanction meets in South Africa because of that 
government's official policy of racial separation. KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, and DON

CHINO ENDS POINT LOMA'S HOME WINNING STREAK AT 143 GAMES

<TEXT>
<P>
There is nothing discrete about the state championship banners that hang in the 
high school gym at Point Loma High. The four gold-and-maroon flags represent, 
in part, the accomplishments of the Pointer girls' basketball teams, which 
until Saturday afternoon had won 143 consecutive games there. 
</P>
<P>
But Chino (12-0), the defending Southern Section 2-A champion from the Baseline 
League in Pomona Valley, wasn't intimidated by the banners, the streak or the 
gym and said so in a resounding 50-39 victory for the championship of the Ben 
Fisher tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"They have those four banners hanging here," Chino Coach Joe Murillo said. "We 
wanted to see what it would be like to come down here and play a ranked team." 
</P>
<P>
They found out. Using a zone defense to negate Point Loma's speed, Chino was 
able to curtail the scoring of Monica Filer and Tyeast Brown, who were held to 
6 and 11 points, respectively. Sophomore Chris Drumm led the Pointers with 15, 
including a fourth-quarter 3-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
"We just couldn't match up with them," Point Loma Coach Lee Trepanier said. 
"Big people wear you down, and they did a good job of it." 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma's tallest player is Brown at 5-feet 11-inches. Chino has four 
players who are taller than 6 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"We're tall," Murillo said. "Sometimes the kids don't realize we can take 
advantage of that. In the third quarter, we started taking advantage of our 
size." 
</P>
<P>
The third quarter proved to be Point Loma's undoing. The Pointers had leads of 
14-12 after a quarter and 22-21 at halftime, but Chino came out and outscored 
Point Loma, 14-6, in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma was also hurt by its free-throw shooting. The Pointers were just 4 
of 10 from the line. 
</P>
<P>
With the loss, Point Loma must start another winning streak from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
"Records are made to be broken," Trepanier said. "So now we start a new one. 
You don't get better if you don't play better teams, and we're still the best 
team in San Diego County." 
</P>
<P>
Felicia Franke and Francine Moreno led Chino with 22 and 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
In other tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
Poway 56, Oceanside 39 -- Dawn Gigstad and Julie Schwan each scored 12 as Poway 
took third place. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry 49, Bonita Vista 36 -- Bonita Vista was able to stay within six 
points of Patrick Henry until the fourth quarter, when several turnovers cost 
the Barons in the fifth-place game. The Patriots outscored Bonita Vista, 19-10, 
in the final quarter. Rochelle Johnson (23) and Sorii Epps (14) combined for 37 
of Patrick Henry's points. Johnson also was the leading rebounder with 17. 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos 43, Chula Vista 35 -- San Marcos (4-1 in the tournament, 5-5 
overall) led, 28-15, at halftime but lost some momentum when the game's leading 
scorer, Susie O'Brien (20) collected her fourth foul and left at the start of 
the third quarter. Chula Vista pulled within 38-35, but with 6 minutes 
remaining, O'Brien returned and San Marcos pulled away to take seventh place.

AZTECS TAKE LOW-KEY ROAD, BUT GET BY VERMONT

SAN DIEGO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vermont certainly is not North Carolina. The first clue came midway through the 
first half of Saturday's Vermont-San Diego State basketball game, when a 
Catamount pass on a fast-break attempt catapulted out of bounds off a Catamount 
head. 
</P>
<P>
The second clue came early in the second half. SDSU was leading by five with 
17:47 left when Aztec Coach Jim Brandenburg called a timeout. Shawn Bell -- in 
the midst of his best game at San Diego State -- walked to the bench and looked 
at the scoreboard. Then he yawned. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs won, 83-76, but the atmosphere in the San Diego Sports Arena wasn't 
exactly as festive as Thursday's 103-92 loss to North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have rather been in a dental chair with no novocaine than endure that 
for 40 minutes," was the way Brandenburg explained it. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,529, the fewest to attend an Aztec home game since 836 watched 
SDSU play Hawaii in the final game of the 1986-1987 season, watched SDSU 
improve to 6-4. Against North Carolina, the Aztecs had set a home attendance 
record of 13,106. 
</P>
<P>
The fallout from the empty arena reached the court, where it was so quiet you 
could hear the ball drop. SDSU had 21 turnovers and Vermont 18. Both teams shot 
48% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"And my New Year's resolution was to not take another drink all year long," 
Brandenburg said. "But I think (the letdown) was very evident -- and 
predictable. We were tremendously emotionally high Thursday, and when you get 
that high, you valley out. We valleyed out really bad." 
</P>
<P>
One of the spectators at the North Carolina game was on the Vermont bench 
Saturday, and Tom Brennan, the Catamount coach, got exactly what he had hoped 
for. 
</P>
<P>
"We caught them at the right time," said Brennan, whose team is 1-5 and has 
lost 10 consecutive road games. "After playing in front of 13,000 rockin' and 
rollin' fans Thursday, and then to play in front of (something like) 13 . . . I 
kept saying 'stay ahead, stay ahead' (to the Aztecs) Thursday because I knew 
there had to be an emotional letdown." 
</P>
<P>
Bell, a transfer from Chicago State, finished with 22 points and 10 rebounds -- 
both personal bests at SDSU. Guard Tony Ross had a season-high 23 points, and 
his four second-half 3-pointers (he had five total) sparked the listless Aztecs 
enough to stop a handful of Vermont comebacks. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs built a 12-point halftime lead, 38-26, as Bell surpassed his 
9.8-point scoring average with 15. Vermont whittled it down to five, 40-35, 
just 2 minutes into the second half and eventually cut it to three, 52-49, with 
12:09 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
It was 55-51 with 10:38 left, but Ross made three 3-pointers in the next 3:24 
to give SDSU some room to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
"Shawn and Tony came through for us when everyone else was really struggling," 
Brandenburg said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Brennan: "Ross and Bell were great tonight." 
</P>
<P>
SDSU guard Bryan Williams wasn't bad, either. He had 9 assists, giving him 19 
for the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to get up for this game, but a lot of people were tired," Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Aztec center Mitch McMullen: "It was a win. You've got to take every one 
you can get." 
</P>
<P>
McMullen, who had career highs of 29 points and 12 rebounds against North 
Carolina, managed just 10 points and 5 rebounds before fouling out with 2:41 to 
play. Joe Calavita led Vermont with 20 points.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: RECORD-SETTING EFFORTS LEAD CHRISTIAN HERITAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two records fell, and the Christian Heritage men's basketball team scored 21 
points in overtime to defeat Point Loma Nazarene College, 123-114, Saturday 
night at Granite Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
In his first game for Christian Heritage, junior forward Brad Soucie, a 
transfer from Eastern Michigan, scored 46 points and broke the single-game 
school record (33) set last year by his brother, senior forward Bill. Brad 
Soucie, who also holds the NCAA Division I playoff record for the most 3-point 
goals in a game (8) had six 3-pointers against the Crusaders. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Kraatz had 19 assists to break the school record he set last year. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Heritage (10-2) now has the best record in NAIA District 3 after its 
second victory this year over Point Loma Nazarene (2-8). Christian Heritage 
evened its all-time mark against PLNC at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Regulation ended at 102-102. 
</P>
<P>
Will Cunningham had 20 points and Kraatz added 17 for the winning Hawks. Mark 
Ryan and Mark Bulgin led Point Loma Nazarene with 35 and 26 points. Bulgin had 
four 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks were 43 of 67 from the field and 28 of 37 from the foul line. Point 
Loma Nazarene was 44 of 82 from the field, 15 of 22 in free throws. 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
U.S. International University (2-10) lost its ninth in a row, 84-74, to 
Missouri at the Larry Lawrence Community Center in La Jolla. USIU had an 18-10 
lead early but was tied at 31-31 on a 16-foot shot by Missouri's Marcia Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
Sonia Carter scored 30 points for USIU. 
</P>
<P>
The University of San Diego lost, 73-59, to Murray State at the USD Sports 
Center. Rochelle Lightner and Paula Mascari each scored 12 points for USD 
(3-5). Sheila Smith scored 24 for Murray State (9-1). 
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego seniors Laurie Bertanyi and Ellen Chi were named to the college 
division first team of the 1988 GTE Academic All-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Bertanyi and Chi were among 39 athletes named to the three academic teams in 
university and college divisions. To qualify, an athlete must be a varsity 
starter or key reserve and maintain a cumulative 3.2 grade point average. 
</P>
<P>
Bertanyi, a setter from Santa Barbara, is a biochemistry major and has a 3.74 
GPA. Chi, also a biochemistry major, is from Downey and maintains a 3.84 GPA.

Was 1988 the year of the dead in the Orange County arts scene? Well, it was the 
year Pacific Symphony conductor Keith Clark was termed "a dead fish," the year 
William Shakespeare was nearly a dead duck in Garden Grove and the year the 
rock zanies in Oingo Boingo held yet another "Dead Man's Party" at Irvine 
Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Jokes notwithstanding, there were encouraging signs of life locally. South 
Coast Repertory Theatre won major national recognition with the 1988 Tony Award 
as best regional theater in the country. The Grove Theatre Co. triumphed over 
considerable civic adversity that threatened for a time to shut down the 
county's only annual Shakespeare festival. The Pacific Symphony demonstrated 
new enthusiasm, with concerts led by guest conductors vying for the 
soon-to-be-vacated music director post. 
</P>
<P>
Local rock bands seemed to flourish, live and on record, despite a paucity of 
clubs in the county that would book them or radio stations that would air their 
music. The Improv in Irvine paved the way for a significant increase in the 
quantity and quality of stand-up comedy in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, in the following four pages critics for The Times Orange 
County Edition offer compendiums of the best -- and in some cases, the worst 
and the silliest -- that the county had to offer during the year in art, music, 
dance, theater, pop and comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 *"Chris Burden: A 20-Year Survey," at the Newport Harbor Art Museum. Orange 
County's major art exhibition of 1988, a massive display of prickly and 
sometimes downright ornery works that are ultimately revelatory of a 
continually questioning, first-rate mind. 
</P>
<P>
*"The Figurative Fifties," at Newport Harbor. Another major show, conceptually 
not as strong as it might have been but with important work on paper by Willem 
de Kooning and terrifically ebullient pieces by the likes of Larry Rivers, 
Grace Hartigan and George McNeil. 
</P>
<P>
*"The Early Works of Charles E. Burchfield," at the Laguna Art Museum. The 
year's most enjoyable historical show, with passionate, idiosyncratic paintings 
by an American original. 
</P>
<P>
*Works from the Pauline Hirsh collection at Laguna Art Museum and the museum's 
South Coast Plaza annex. Provocative early pieces by several mostly 
lesser-known contemporary artists. 
</P>
<P>
*The Lorrin and Deane Wong collection at the Art Institute of Southern 
California. Pieces by important contemporary American and European artists, 
many of whom have never shown in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
*"Bare Facts, Sly Humor," at the Irvine Fine Arts Center and "Suburban Visions, 
Middle-Class Dreams," at the Muckenthaler Cultural Center in Fullerton. Recent 
unconventional work in photography and a timely subject illustrated with some 
wonderfully quirky picks. Both of these shows were part of "Photography: Inside 
Out," a countywide series of exhibits that helped boost the level of community 
art center offerings this year. 
</P>
<P>
* Angie Bray's "Night Lies" installation at BC Space in Laguna Beach: An 
installation tapping 
</P>
<P>
deep psychological veins via artlessly simple means, and also very possibly a 
breakthrough for the Laguna Beach artist. 
</P>
<P>
*"Inside Out" at BC Space. Shattering images and voices of the mentally ill 
imprisoned in a locked ward (by Mary Ellen Mark) or trying to make it on their 
own in the "real" world (by Lonnie Shavelson) -- surely the year's most 
significant show addressing a major social issue. CATHY CURTIS

</P>
<P>
 *International star Fernando Bujones danced Lensky in John Cranko's "Onegin" 
as a guest with the National Ballet of Canada, June 7 to 12, at the Center. But 
the company was not lacking in its own roster of dancers. Among a trio of 
casts, Sabina Allemann was a most lyric, expressive Tatiana, and Frank Augustyn 
a cold, world-weary Onegin. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadians also brought Glen Tetley's "Alice," with Kimberly Glasco as a 
melting Young Alice and Rex Harrington as a Byronic Lewis Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
As a curtain-raiser, the company danced no less than Balanchine's profound "The 
Four Temperaments" -- and danced it superbly. 
</P>
<P>
*Merche Esmeralda brought demonic power, shattering intensity to "Medea" during 
the Royal Spanish National Ballet run at the Center, Aug. 2 to 7. 
</P>
<P>
*American Ballet Theatre unveiled a costly new staging of "Swan Lake" by 
company artistic director Mikhail Baryshnikov during its Nov. 29 to Dec. 11 run 
at the Center. Five pairs of Swan Queens and Siegfrieds danced in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
ABT excelled in Balanchine's masterpiece, "Stravinsky Violin Concerto." 
</P>
<P>
Also during ABT's run, three former members of Twyla Tharp Dance company (Kevin 
O'Day, Jamie Bishton and Daniel Sanchez) -- folded into the New York company 
now that Tharp is artistic associate of ABT -- appeared in her inventive, 
virtuoso "The Fugue," danced to silence. 
</P>
<P>
*The dance department at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa sponsored two dance 
and music events in October and netted about $3,000 to benefit ACTION (AIDS 
Coalition to Identify Orange County Needs), a 4-year-old grass-roots 
organization that provides educational services and coordinates informational 
meetings for the public, among other aims. 
</P>
<P>
Participating groups included Rhapsody in Taps (formerly LTD/Dance Unlimited), 
the Gloria Newman Dance Theatre, Ecos de Espana, Middle Eastern dancer Angelika 
Nemeth and composer Lisbeth Woodies. CHRIS PASLES

UTILITY SUES IN THEFT OF POWER

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. filed a $500,000 lawsuit against a Lakeside 
couple for allegedly stealing more than $40,000 worth of gas and electricity 
from the utility over three years. Beth Eagleson, SDG&amp;E's corporate 
attorney, said Friday that the suit against Jerry P. and Cathy A. Goulart seeks 
to recover punitive damages and about $42,500 worth of energy stolen from the 
utility. "Based upon measurement of actual use compared to their load 
information, a back bill for gas and electric service was prepared," Eagleson 
said. According to company spokesman Dave Smith, load information refers to the 
energy used by household appliances. The law allows utilities to try to recover 
the cost of stolen electricity, plus treble damages. In this case, Eagleson 
said, that amounts to $127,789.50. In addition, she said, SDG&amp;E is seeking 
$300,000 in punitive damages. Eagleson did not say how the Goularts' case was 
discovered. According to the San Diego County district attorney's office, 
criminal charges are also involved. In addition to fiscal penalties, Eagleson 
said, "It's important to remember that energy diversion is also dangerous."

1988: A HUMBLING YEAR FOR THE MIGHTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Orange County in 1988, the natural disasters were few. The human misfortunes 
were many. 
</P>
<P>
The ground didn't shake too much, and even the drought-parched canyons did not 
ignite. True, there was the winter storm early in the year that caused the 
newly rebuilt Huntington Beach Pier to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
But that was nothing compared to the collapse of careers and the tumbling of 
stature among many of the county's once-towering figures. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year that the mighty fell: 
</P>
<P>
* A rising star in the Republican Party plummeted when he forged a signature on 
a check in a last-ditch effort to bail out his campaign for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
* A millionaire video producer from Newport Beach was charged with making 
illegal campaign contributions to failed Democratic presidential hopeful Gary 
Hart and other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
* An Orange County supervisor, running for Congress, was caught red-faced when 
it was revealed that she did not graduate from college, as her biographies 
stated. 
</P>
<P>
* Even the always-powerful Orange County Republican Party took it on the chin 
when it posted uniformed security guards at polling places in Latino areas of 
Santa Ana to warn non-citizens not to vote, prompting an FBI investigation into 
allegations of voter intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, 1988 was the election year that many people would like to forget. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the venerable Rep. Robert E. Badham (R-Newport Beach), a six-term 
congressman, surprised supporters by announcing that he would not run for 
reelection, which opened the door to a free-for-all that led to a promising 
young politician's demise. 
</P>
<P>
C. David Baker, Irvine city councilman and former college basketball star, 
seemed to be the heir-apparent to Badham's seat until C. Christopher Cox gave 
him a run for his money in the June primary. And when that money began to run 
short in the final days before the election, a desperate Baker turned to the 
bank account of a nonprofit health foundation that he directed for an advance 
on a loan that was a few days late. He wrote a $48,000 check to himself, 
signing his own name and forging the signature of a judge, a foundation 
director. He stopped payment on the check shortly after it was written, but the 
damage was done. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who was narrowly defeated by Cox, pleaded guilty to a felony forgery 
count, but a Superior Court judge later reduced the charge to a misdemeanor. 
The judge ordered Baker to perform community service and gave him a year's 
probation and a 1-year suspended jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of what the penalty was today, this will not be over," Baker said 
on the day he was sentenced. Even when the sentence was imposed, Baker was 
delivering hot meals to the elderly and working with children. "Some good will 
come out of this one way or another. I'm not really sure how." 
</P>
<P>
Another legislative seat unexpectedly opened with the death of Assemblyman 
Richard E. Longshore (R-Santa Ana) the day after voters nominated him for a 
second term. 
</P>
<P>
That opened up a king-sized contest between Republicans and Democrats for his 
seat, and that race, too, led to a finish-line stumble. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sent Out the Guards 
</P>
<P>
In their fervor to see their candidate, Curt Pringle, win, county Republican 
Party officials not only got out the vote on Nov. 8, they also sent out the 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
Uniformed security guards were hired by the party to stand watch at heavily 
Latino polling places to warn people that it was illegal for non-citizens to 
vote. The Democrats cried foul, and even high-ranking Republicans denounced the 
move. The FBI and district attorney's office are now investigating whether 
election laws were violated, and several Latino and labor organizations have 
filed suit to overturn the election results in the 72nd Assembly District, 
where Pringle ended up winning by a mere 867 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder's election foibles left her with a red face. 
Running for Congress in the June primary, Wieder conceded under pressure from 
her opponent that she had left uncorrected a 25-year-old error on her biography 
that stated she had received a bachelor's degree in journalism from Wayne State 
University in Detroit. In truth, she was unable to attend college because of 
family finances. Also under fire from slow-growth advocates for her votes on 
development agreements, Wieder lost the race. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Karl Stubbed His Toe 
</P>
<P>
Republicans did not have a monopoly on election-year problems. Stuart Karl Jr., 
the millionaire producer of the Jane Fonda workout tapes, was fined $60,000 and 
placed on 3 years' probation for making $185,000 in illegal campaign 
contributions to self-destructing presidential candidate Gary Hart and others. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, I'm not sure why I did these things," Karl said after his 
sentencing. "You're attracted to the lure of being involved. People begin to 
make you feel important. I should have looked deeper and not done the things I 
did. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Hamburger magnate Carl N. Karcher also took a tumble. Known for his fast food 
and patriotism, the founder of Carl's Jr. restaurants was accused by the 
federal government of insider trading, for allegedly tipping off his relatives 
about some bad news that his company was about to release. While a federal 
judge has ruled that Karcher's son, Carl Leo Karcher, did engage in the illegal 
behavior, the case against the senior Karcher is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
"These charges are totally false," Karcher said after the civil lawsuit was 
filed in April. "My wife and I did not sell any of our stock, nor did we tell 
anyone else to do so. . . . To suggest that any of us would intentionally 
violate the securities laws is highly offensive."

Crystal Cathedral Cutback 
</P>
<P>
Even God's squad was taken down a notch or two in 1988. While televangelist 
Robert H. Schuller stayed clear of the scandals that rocked his collared 
colleagues, the fallout hit the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove. In May, 
Schuller announced sharp cutbacks in his "Hour of Power" broadcast ministry, a 
result of reduced contributions because of televangelism scandal "shock waves," 
the October, 1987, stock market crash and the decision by a New York City cable 
television station to eliminate paid religious programming. 
</P>
<P>
Still, not everyone had a bad 1988. Braving the Siberian cold, marathon swimmer 
Lynne Cox of Los Alamitos became the first person to navigate a significant 
distance across the Soviet Union's Lake Baikal, the world's deepest lake. 
America's darling and Placentia's own Janet Evans won three gold medals in the 
pool at the Summer Olympics in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
And despite the misfortunes of other politicians, two former White House aides 
were launched on promising careers. Cox, after toughing it out with Baker in 
the congressional primary, sailed to easy victory in November. Dana 
Rohrabacher, after tipping off voters to Wieder's erroneous resume, was elected 
to the 42nd Congressional District post that was vacated by Daniel E. Lungren 
(R-Long Beach), who tried -- and failed -- to become the state's treasurer.

</P>
<P>
Political Comeback 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was perhaps no bigger political comeback in Orange County in 1988 
than the one that took place on a gentle hillside in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
The honoree was not able to attend, but hundreds of supporters gathered to 
watch a bulldozer scrape up the first bucket of dirt where a library soon will 
stand to house the papers and mementos of Orange County's native son and the 
nation's only resigned president, Richard M. Nixon.

development, was defeated 55.7% to 44.3% in the June 7 primary. The initiative 
had been favored in early, pre-primary polls, but growth proponents, who 
collected and spent nearly $2 million, poured it on as the election neared. 
Those favoring growth controls spent little and campaigned less for the failed 
measure. MARK BOSTER / Los Angeles Times; Photo, Anaheim Motorcycle Officer

Jan. 18. Plans are for the pier to be rebuilt, reopening possibly in the spring 
of 1991. KEN HIVELY / Los Angeles Times; Photo, A crowd of 1,500 gathered in

1988 THE YEAR IN REVIEW;

NONPARTISAN LOCAL ELECTIONS: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our readers wrote letters throughout 1988 expressing their viewpoints on a 
variety of issues. Here are condensed versions of some of those letters. We 
appreciate their taking the time to share their viewpoints and look forward to 
hearing from you in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo's elections were marked by an evil partisanship that destroys 
the fabric of a local community. There are many very good reasons that city 
councils, supervisors, school boards, judges, city attorneys and planning 
commissions should not be elected on a national political party basis. 
</P>
<P>
The chief rationale is that the issues they decide involve quasi-judicial 
functions and executive-legislative interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
Neither party serves the local constituency well by attempting to influence the 
voter to vote along party lines. 
</P>
<P>
The motivation is purely selfish and defeats the essence of local control. The 
issues are essentially nonpartisan.

Pamela Dilday-Davis on leash laws: 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach police have finally caught up with me. After a year of 
reckless disregard for the law, I was cited recently for walking my dog off the 
leash. I have difficulty with the leash law, which dictates that all dogs, even 
those with no criminal record, have to be restrained when outdoors. No such law 
pertains to the roving gangs of tough cats. The officer allowed that he thought 
it was indeed a shame that dogs in Newport Beach had no place to run free. I 
don't walk Sophie without a leash anymore. I'd like to say that I've been 
rehabilitated. But every once in a while, when it's dark and no one can see us, 
the old urge to run free takes hold, and we're off on another crime spree in 
the streets of Newport Beach.

Donald A. Sizemore on the homeless: 
</P>
<P>
For all our concern with morality we are confronted daily with an immense evil 
that few seem to care about and fewer still seek to halt. That evil is 
homelessness in Orange County, and its companions: poverty, illness and hunger. 
For most, accustomed to our county's image of prosperity, it is virtually 
impossible to believe that thousands of Orange County residents are living in 
conditions reminiscent of the Appalachia of 3 decades ago. For the few who 
become aware of this issue there is always the comfortable lie that the poor 
deserve their rags, malnutrition and loss of dignity. The truth is a horrifying 
indictment of Orange County's values and priorities -- both public and private. 
It takes only $4 a day to shelter, feed and assist the homeless. The issue is 
seldom a lack of resources -- it is usually lack of concern, leadership or, in 
a very real sense, a lack of morality when it comes to the poor.

David Camplin on drug use: 
</P>
<P>
I see the problem every day I'm in school. Friends ditch school to go to the 
beach and do drugs. Friends skip class and go to a field to smoke a quick 
joint. People in my classes sell paraphernalia as well as the drugs right in 
class. I see kids destroying their lives with such substances as pot, cocaine, 
crack, acid, speed and many other drugs. We've got to wage a war against drug 
abuse. Some users just need someone to accept them and be their friend -- 
outside of the drug circles. We need to care enough to listen and be willing to 
help them. If drug users do not respond to that we need to inform as many 
authorities as necessary to get the person off drugs. I've seen some beautiful 
lives produced from horrible ones because they were forced into programs.

Jerry Collins on new fatherhood: 
</P>
<P>
Life doesn't begin at 55, but it sure can take a fresh turn. It has for me . I 
have a baby son. It's an odd feeling being a father again. A daughter, 25, a 
son, 18, and a baby. I must take note of the change in the delivery process. 
Back in the '60s, husbands had little to do with it. It was a mother's affair, 
and the doctor's business. The husband's principal task was to stay out of the 
way -- just get mom to the hospital in time. This time I was there. In the 
delivery room, actually being helpful. The years and the participation in the 
delivery have given me new perspective on new little human beings. I look upon 
them for what they are, not what they will be. They are struggling, curious, 
funny and courageous. Little things mean a lot to them. Children are children. 
They are not, nor should they ever be expected to be, small adults. Twenty 
years ago, it couldn't have been this way. Fathers felt foolish pushing their 
babies along in strollers, or sharing a rattle with them in a public park. Not 
today. Fathers may now feel a little clumsy, but not foolish. That's the way it 
is with Jeremy and me.

 In every survey of Orange County issues and in every poll of attitudes, 
transportation and traffic congestion consistently emerge as the No. 1 concern 
on people's minds today. But we don't need polls and surveys to tell us traffic 
is a problem. And we can all feel the frustrations of thinking that no one, 
anywhere, is doing anything about it. 
</P>
<P>
Well, some positive things are being done: widening the San Diego Freeway, 
rebuilding the aged Santa Ana-Costa Mesa freeways interchange and lengthening 
the Costa Mesa Freeway past the Orange County Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
These freeway improvements are only one part of our energetic effort to meet 
our transportation problems head-on. New transportation facilities are needed. 
More flexible work hours, more ride-sharing and other transportation-management 
techniques are on tap.

 To vote or not to vote? That was the question Orange County voters faced Nov. 
8. That question became difficult in the 72nd Assembly District when the Orange 
County Republican Party sent uniformed security guards to 20 Santa Ana 
precincts to intimidate Hispanic voters. 
</P>
<P>
As a registered Republican, even I am amazed at how bold our leaders have 
become. Our elective process is founded on the principle that the voter not be 
intimidated at the ballot box. Not since the 1960s have such tactics been used. 
They were unjust then, and they are outrageously unjust now.

 Let's look at growth in Orange County as if we all had a stake in tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
One way or another, our children are going to pay for the countless ills 
brought about by unwise development. There's still time, however, to move into 
the next century with style. 
</P>
<P>
Let's work together to find ways to preserve open space and recreation land, to 
develop affordable housing, to create jobs, to control traffic and to improve 
the quality of life. Nuts to those of limited vision who would surrender our 
future to past mistakes.

Orange County. I opened up the newspaper and read, among other things, that the 
average Orange County home price is $175,000, highest in the nation. It is no 
wonder that the middle-class dream of owning a home is now out of reach for 
most young Orange County families. I'm a case in point. Before moving we lived 
in a two-bedroom apartment in Westminster for $610 a month. I accepted a job in 
Denver. We moved into a brand new three-bedroom, two-story home. It includes a 
yard, a full basement and a view of the mountains. We bought the house for 
$110,000 at a 7.8% fixed, 30-year mortgage rate. A staffing manager who 
recruits professional workers for my new company told me that the richest pool 
of engineers is in Southern California -- it's easy to lure them away because 
of the high cost of housing.

We want Janet. 
</P>
<P>
We want Janet shampoo (She cleaned up at Seoul, now she wants to clean up your 
scalp), we want Janet toothpaste (She'll do to your plaque what she did to the 
East Germans) and we want Janet Cliff Notes (When gold medals get in the way of 
The Great Gatsby). We want Janet-Jammies, we want JANET-LAND and yes, we want 
our JTV. 
</P>
<P>
We want Janet Evans in our newspapers and magazines, on our coffee tables and 
television screens. We want Janet because she's the best, the brightest and 
because she giggles after she wins Olympic gold medals, sets swimming world 
records or eats pizza. 
</P>
<P>
We want Janet Evans so badly that when she returned home to Placentia after 
winning three gold medals (400-meter individual medley, 400- and 800-freestyle) 
during the Seoul Summer Olympics, we practically chased her back to South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Television cameras, still photographers, newspaper reporters, magazine writers, 
TV personalities. And that was just Day 1. Taking in the crush of media-types 
onto Placentia's El Dorado High School, where Evans is a senior and reigning 
homecoming queen, classmate Shane Borowski said, "We all feel sorry for her. I 
mean, look at that." 
</P>
<P>
Evans claimed she wanted to be "Just Janet," but her commercial value has been 
assessed in mega-bucks. Still, she's balked at signing professional 
endorsements, choosing to search for a semblance of a normal life. 
</P>
<P>
Good luck. At age 17, Janet Evans was Orange County's top sports story of 1988. 
The 105-pound girl from Placentia was bigger than the play-dead Angels and 
their amazing revolving managers (Mauch-to-Cookie-to-Moose-to-Rader). 
</P>
<P>
Bigger than the Rams, whose Super Bowl hopes got as far as a wild-card game in 
Minnesota. That's where they lost under climatic conditions usually reserved 
for better shops and department stores. 
</P>
<P>
She made a bigger splash than Lynne Cox, who swam a Russian lake in search of a 
different kind of medal. (What's so funny about peace, love and understanding?) 
She was a bigger hit than Angel catcher Bob Boone, who had his best year 
batting and then bolted the Angels for the Kansas City Royals for just one 
dollar more than he earned with the Angels in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Evans headed an amazing army of Orange County athletes under 21 years of age 
who showed up their elders during the year. Placentia's Michael Chang, 16, 
became the youngest male to win a singles match at Wimbledon and went on to 
become, along with Andre Agassi, the next great hope for American tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Placentia's Michele Granger, 18, now a freshman at California, was recognized 
as the world's greatest softball pitcher, setting a dizzying array of national 
softball pitching records while at Valencia High. 
</P>
<P>
There was Servite High's Derek Brown, 17, who set the county single-season 
rushing record and University of Houston running back Chuck Weatherspoon, 20, a 
La Habra High alumnus who rushed for 1,005 yards and led the nation in yards 
per carry (8.5). 
</P>
<P>
There were Elaine Youngs (El Toro), Jenny Evans (Newport Harbor) and Laurie 
Jones (Huntington Beach) who, as freshmen, played major roles on the UCLA 
women's volleyball team that went 34-0 before losing in the semifinals of the 
NCAA championships. Bob Hamelin, at age 20, batted .514 for Rancho Santiago 
College and hit a state-record 31 home runs and 105 RBIs in 48 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Mater Dei boys' basketball team won its fourth consecutive 5-A championship 
despite recruiting allegations made against its athletic programs and the 
team's failure to win the league title. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar High, with an enrollment of only 1,400, won Southern Section 
championships in girls' track, girls' tennis, water polo, football and a state 
championship in boys' cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine High girls' volleyball team won its second straight state 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
The grownups' table -- filled with resignations, firings, disappointment and 
guys named Moose -- did have some bright spots. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Louganis of the Mission Viejo Nadadores became the first male to sweep 
gold medals in diving in two Olympics. Newport Harbor's Greg Barton won two 
gold medals in kayaking during the Summer Olympics, becoming the first American 
to win a gold medal in singles kayaking. The Rams' Jim Everett set team 
single-season records for pass completions, yards and touchdowns. Receiver 
Henry Ellard set a season record for receptions. The Angels' Johnny Ray was an 
All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
But overall, it was the kids who were more than all right in 1988. And leading 
the way were . . . 
</P>
<P>
NOT JUST JANET ANYMORE 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Troup, director of U.S. Swimming Inc., had tested more than 1,000 
swimmers for energy efficiency when he came across Janet Evans. After testing 
her prior to the Summer Games, he proclaimed Evans the most energy efficient 
"male or female" swimmer today. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll stop short of saying Janet's a fish," said Troup, in a Sports Illustrated 
article, "but physiologically she's very similar." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever she was, she was like nothing most people had ever seen -- three gold 
medals and one world record in events long dominated by women with thick 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
She tore through the Olympic pool with a slapping stroke that, above water, 
looked like the last desperate plea of a drowning victim. 
</P>
<P>
Experts told us what happens above the water doesn't matter, it's what happens 
below, and below the water, they said, Janet Evans was perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Three gold medals made that easy to figure. But what seemed to endear Evans to 
the American public was what happened above the water: the block-long smile, 
the giggles, the absolute absence of pretense. 
</P>
<P>
She became insta-star, America's kid sister. Swimmer Matt Biondi won more gold 
medals (5), sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner was more awesome to watch, Carl 
Lewis and Greg Louganis might have proven themselves the nation's greatest 
Olympians, but no American came back from Seoul more adored than Janet Evans. 
</P>
<P>
She walked off a plane and in front of a television camera. Make that cameras. 
Returning to Placentia, the Evans' family car passed under banners thanking 
Janet, lawns drafting her ("Janet For Mayor," the placards read) and home to a 
block party attended by 500 close friends, well-wishers, strangers, gawkers and 
minicams. 
</P>
<P>
Her first day back at school was no less hectic: battalions of reporters and 
photographers descending upon El Dorado High. 
</P>
<P>
She appeared with rich man, Johnny Carson of The Tonight Show, and Poorman, on 
KROQ radio with deejay The Poorman, and received an invitation to the White 
House from The Man. 
</P>
<P>
She rode in the Disneyland Parade, the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade and was grand 
marshal of the Placentia Heritage Days Parade. 
</P>
<P>
Naively, she observed, "I've never come from a meet and had anything like this 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back with several months of perspective, she revised, "I guess I should 
have realized that it was the Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
She said that sitting in a hotel room in Phoenix, the day before she was to be 
grand marshal of the Fiesta Day Parade. She has been the toast at banquets, 
luncheons and award presentations. But she has refused to sign any endorsement 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
Though the media demand for her is much less frenzied, "it's died down a lot," 
it is still constant -- there are a couple national magazine covers planned for 
her for early 1989. There are more than a few companies that would love to have 
her on their side of the debit column. But no. One call to Biondi, who did sign 
the endorsement deals, persuaded her. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me he didn't have a home, that he just lived from hotel room to hotel 
room, 'just going where they tell me to,' " Evans said. "We talked to them 
(companies) and they said I could make a lot of money but it would be a 
full-time job, that I would be so busy that I wouldn't be able to finish high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"I know if I did it, I could be set for life, but finishing high school is very 
important to me, so I said no." 
</P>
<P>
And then she probably smiled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THREE IN A FISHBOWL 
</P>
<P>
Michael Chang stepped into 1988 already having the distinction of being the 
youngest male tennis player to win the U.S. Tennis Assn. national 18-and-under 
singles title and the youngest to win a singles match at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, at 16, he became the youngest to win a singles match at Wimbledon. He 
advanced to the U.S. Open's fourth round this year before being eliminated by 
the 18-year-old Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
With the best tennis players in the world now residing in West Germany and 
Sweden, Chang and Agassi's coming of age signaled hope for American men's 
tennis, which has been mired in post-Jimbo/Big Mac depression. 
</P>
<P>
Like Agassi, Chang hits the ball with amazing velocity and moves his body just 
about as fast. Pancho Segura compared him to a young Ken Rosewall. 
</P>
<P>
France's Henry LeConte succinctly summed up Chang's past, present and future 
when he said, "He moves so quickly with such good timing. I'm thinking, 
'Sixteen years old?' God." 
</P>
<P>
Michele Granger did everything in 1988 to confirm that she is the best softball 
pitcher in the world. She ended her high school career at Valencia holding 
national records for single-season strikeouts, career strikeouts, career 
no-hitters and tied the mark for single-season no-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
But while she has won numerous national and international titles -- including a 
gold medal during the 1987 Pan American Games -- she failed to win a Southern 
Section championship in her 4 years at Valencia High. Her high school career 
came to a bizarre end during a 25-inning, 3-A semifinal game against La Mirada 
that took 2 days to play. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia had 10 hits in the game but failed to score. The Tigers also made 9 
errors, 3 of which led to La Mirada's 1 run and the victory. Granger struck out 
40 in the game and afterward, in, perhaps, 1988's greatest overstatement said, 
"I let my team down." 
</P>
<P>
Derek Brown came into 1988 having performed well in 2 varsity seasons as the 
starting tailback for arguably Orange County's highest-profile football program 
-- Servite High in Anaheim. But he played in the long shadow cast by Crespi 
High's Russell White, who came into this year a two-time winner of the 
large-school division's most valuable player award. 
</P>
<P>
White began the season with the publicity, but Brown eventually made the season 
his own. In a memorable October meeting between the two backs, Brown outgained 
White 312 yards to 81 as Servite won the game 35-20. 
</P>
<P>
Brown went on to lead the Southern Section in rushing and set an Orange County 
single-season rushing record with 2,301 yards. He and Fountain Valley 
quarterback David Henigan were named co-Division 1 most valuable players. 
</P>
<P>
When it was clear that Brown was having a better season than White, the Crespi 
back quipped, "He better remember who was the originator and who is the 
imitator." 
</P>
<P>
By year's end, Derek Brown and the rest of Orange County's kid wonders made 
certain they'd be remembered for quite a while.

STOCK WATCH: SOME COMPANIES HIT HARDEST BY CRASH PICKED UP THE PIECES, CAME OUT 
AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SCHINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Friday, the last trading day of 1988, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
briefly climbed above the level it had enjoyed before the October, 1987, market 
collapse. It was a fitting end to a year that proved stronger than expected, 
with the Dow increasing 12%. 
</P>
<P>
It was equally fitting that the best performing Orange County stocks of 1988 
were among those hardest hit by the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's star performers managed to rescue themselves from the rubble to 
either approach or surpass their pre-crash highs. In most cases, analysts said, 
they are solid companies that enjoyed healthy returns. 
</P>
<P>
ICN Biomedicals, a Costa Mesa medical instruments and chemicals company, led 
the pack on a percentage basis. The stock rose 331%, starting the year at $3.25 
and finishing at $14. 
</P>
<P>
For the first 9 months of its current fiscal year, ICN Biomedicals has enjoyed 
a 35% increase in earnings. Its third-quarter performance was even stronger, 
with profits up 59%. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco Corp., an Irvine manufacturer of office copier and printer products, 
placed second, appreciating 126% for the year. Gradco stock, which began the 
year at $5.875, closed at $13.25. 
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year ended March, 1988, Gradco reported net income of $4.1 
million on sales of $90.9 million, and the company continued to post strong 
numbers over the latter part of the year. 
</P>
<P>
During the past 12 months, most investors steered clear of small companies. 
Many had been burned badly by the crash. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the smaller Orange County companies are not very liquid, and they 
just got hammered in the crash, as people fell over themselves to get out of 
them," said Larry Selwitz, director of research at Cruttenden &amp; Co., a 
Newport Beach brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
Many investors who got back into the market in 1988 initially chose to buy 
stocks in larger, more established companies. 
</P>
<P>
But as the year wore on and many Orange County companies began to report strong 
earnings, investors started funneling money into such companies as ICN 
Biomedicals, Ropak and Gradco. 
</P>
<P>
"The stock of some of these companies had become so oversold that people 
realized these prices offered unusually good value," Selwitz said. "It was an 
opportunity for people to make a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the county's biggest market losers generally reflected unspectacular 
corporate performance. 
</P>
<P>
Resdel Industries, a Newport Beach electronics firm, lost the most ground in 
1988. Its stock began the year at $5.25 a share and crashed to $1.4375, a 73% 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
The company posted an $8.3-million loss for the year ended June 30 and 
disclosed in October that it had laid off 130 people, or more than a third of 
its work force. The firm's problems were attributed primarily to unsuccessful 
efforts to expand through acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
Another bomb was Diceon Electronics, which began the year trading at $30.50 but 
declined to $12.50 at year end, losing 59% of its value. 
</P>
<P>
Diceon had sales of $147 million and earned $9.8 million in the fiscal year 
ended in September. But most of its profits were realized in the first 6 months 
of the year, while the second half was a dud. Analysts are projecting that the 
company will have flat earnings for the first half of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Diceon, which for several years has been one of Orange County's 
top performing growth companies, was snubbed by analysts and investors. 
</P>
<P>
Preston Athey, a growth fund manager for T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, said he 
continues to hold Diceon and several other Orange County stocks because of what 
he believes are bright prospects for small growth companies in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
T. Rowe Price has about $1.3 billion invested in emerging growth funds. The 
investment firm's Orange County holdings include National Education of Irvine, 
Silicon Systems of Tustin and Archive Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Athey said a statistical indicator used by T. Rowe Price recently signaled that 
many, small growth companies "are grossly undervalued" relative to historic 
norms. 
</P>
<P>
"If the past is any indication, 1989 is the year that these stocks will do very 
well relative to the rest of the market," Athey said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is particularly bullish about small growth companies because many 
economists and analysts are projecting that their earnings growth will outpace 
larger companies in 1989.
