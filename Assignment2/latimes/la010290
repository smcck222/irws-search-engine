NAVY CHEFS TAKE SAVORY VOYAGE AT SAN DIEGO SCHOOL; 
</P>
<P>
COOKING: THE SERVICE IS OUT TO IMPROVE ITS CULINARY IMAGE BY TRAINING ITS BEST 
AND BRIGHTEST CHEFS AT A SCHOOL FOR ADVANCED COOKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"No guts, no glory," said former Navy Master Chief Petty Officer Romeo Basmayor 
as he wielded a knife in front of 20 sailors. 
</P>
<P>
With surgical precision, he attacked a turnip, deftly carving it into a 
pristine white rose. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're out on a six-month deployment aboard a destroyer, don't just dump 
out all your parsley," Basmayor ordered. "Because you won't be getting any 
more." 
</P>
<P>
At the Navy's only advanced culinary school, 25 students hone specialized 
skills such as cake decorating, garnishing and ice carving. They are the Navy's 
best and brightest cooks, who earn the cumbersome title of mess management 
specialist. They can whip up beef stew for 300 or bake Virginia ham with 
pineapple raisin sauce for an admiral and visiting dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
A Navy vessel "is a big city that floats, so you need people with different 
specialties," said Lt. Ken Luchka, spokesman for the Naval Training Center, 
which hosts the advanced food preparation school as well as boot camp for 
thousands of sailors. 
</P>
<P>
For sailor-chefs, kitchens of the sea pose unique challenges. Mike Burkhart, 
19, had just made nine coconut cream pies when his submarine abruptly dove 
down, sending the pies flying. 
</P>
<P>
"We're supposed to get warned before they do that," said Burkhart, an Orrville, 
Ohio, native stationed aboard the submarine James Madison. 
</P>
<P>
Burkhart and others come to the school in San Diego because they love their 
trade, despite the aggravations. Most sailor-chefs acknowledge that Navy 
cuisine suffers an image problem and that crews usually call cooks "stewheads." 
</P>
<P>
"Cooks have a really bad reputation -- it's come with the years," said Colleen 
Larreau, a 28-year-old New Jersey resident who used to cook for Adm. William J. 
Crowe, the retired former chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff. "The Navy is 
trying to teach more pride and professionalism." 
</P>
<P>
Each year, about 300 sailors graduate from the advanced food preparation 
school. In groups of 25, they attend the three-week school that includes 
classes in Italian and French cooking, and teaches how to manage a kitchen 
aboard a sea-bound vessel for up to six months. When they cook, they must pay 
attention to nutrition, taste, cost, visual appeal, color scheme and morale. 
</P>
<P>
"If sailors start a day with a bad stomach, it's not only that you messed up a 
meal but you've possibly made a bad crew," said Lt. Cmdr. John Pemberton, 
director of supply schools at the training center. "You're concerned not only 
with the person eating, but morale. And the further you are from payday, the 
more you need to serve morale-boosting food." 
</P>
<P>
In the Navy, that means pizza, steak, ice cream, strawberry shortcake and, when 
possible, lobster. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the cooks, the reward is in the creation and appreciation of the 
meal. "It really gets me going when someone comes back and says, 'Great chow,' 
" said Walt Berrey, a 26-year-old Washington native who cooks aboard the 
submarine Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
Others rein in their creative instincts to cater to the more traditional 
palates of crews. And they all, more or less, follow the prescribed recipes 
devised by the Armed Forces Recipe Service. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people in the Navy grew up with overcooked green beans. So I won't cook 
al dente," said Regis McDonald, 32, a Louisville, Ohio, native who enlisted 12 
years ago. "You try subtle changes -- you do a little at a time." 
</P>
<P>
For sailor-chefs, garnishing, ice carving and cake decorating are one of their 
few chances at culinary creativity. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Burns, a 19-year-old Minnesota resident, gazes at an undecorated cake 
like an artist looking at an empty canvas. "I look at it and think of what I 
can do," said Burns, who adds that an award-winning cake takes about two hours 
to decorate. Burns won four first-place awards in Minneapolis contests 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
Burns and others sometimes buck their families when they join the Navy and 
become cooks. "My family was shocked," said Burns, whose father had hoped he 
would follow in his footsteps and become a foreman in a utility plant. "I say 
that's just not me." 
</P>
<P>
About 90% of the school's graduates end up on vessels at sea. But most would 
rather be on shore and close to their hometown, Pemberton said. "We say, 'Join 
the Navy and see the world.' Most students don't want to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Only those at the top get to choose their assignments. Aside from short 
postings, duty aboard the newer vessels, like Aegis cruisers, are usually 
popular because of the more modern and spacious kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
The school is an effort to bolster the flagging image of Navy cuisine, dubbed 
"mess," by instilling more pride in cooks, officials say. Some, including 
cooks, say it's an uphill battle. But those at the school are confident that 
they will win. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days, only the captains' food was garnished. When it comes to 
garnishing, if it looks good, I bet it tastes good," Basmayor said. "The 
majority of people eat with their eyes." 
</P>
<P>
To prove his point in one recent class, Basmayor showed students how to make 
bachelor's button flowers out of radishes, a bird-shaped bowl from a pineapple 
and a banana, a rose bush from celery and turnips, and rosebuds from tomato 
peel. 
</P>
<P>
For major holidays or events such as change-of-command ceremonies, Basmayor 
suggests the chefs make ice sculptures from 3-foot-tall blocks of ice, which 
cost about $37. 
</P>
<P>
Using such niceties, officials say they hope to stem the attrition of sailors 
and boost morale aboard Navy vessels. But as a former Navy man, Basmayor 
recognizes that not all commanding officers will look favorably upon frills 
like garnishing. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, you run into some who say, 'Don't garnish, it's a waste of time and 
money.' But I'd rather spend a little money on garnishing rather than just 
throwing the food down," he said. "Garnishing is what? It's imagination."

MAN STABBED DURING FIGHT OVER VAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A newspaper delivery man making his rounds Monday stabbed a man who was trying 
to steal his van in the Pacific Beach area, San Diego police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Robert McGee, a newspaper carrier for the San Diego Union, was 
delivering his papers about 6:35 a.m. in the 1300 block of Thomas Avenue and 
had momentarily left the van unattended with its engine running. 
</P>
<P>
As McGee, 47, returned to the van, a man climbed inside and began driving away, 
police said. McGee jumped in front of the van three times, finally forcing the 
van to roll to a stop, they said. 
</P>
<P>
A fight then broke out in the street, and McGee stabbed the man in the back 
with a knife, police said. Although it was unclear who owned the knife, police 
said McGee acted in self-defense during the fight. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded man, Daniel Hernandez, 31, was listed in fair condition at Scripps 
Memorial Hospital in La Jolla. Police said he was booked on suspicion of auto 
theft.

INVESTIGATORS PROBE SCATTERED EXPLOSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least five explosions rocked scattered sites in San Diego early New Year's 
Day, breaking windows at a neighborhood market, scattering customers at a bar 
and destroying a residential mailbox, among other damage. 
</P>
<P>
One person suffered minor injuries in the blasts, the Fire Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said it was not clear whether there was any link between the 
explosions, which varied considerably in intensity and occurred intermittently 
during an almost six-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
Police and Fire Department arson experts were investigating. 
</P>
<P>
At least five explosions were confirmed, but authorities said there may have 
been additional blasts. Information on some of the incidents was still sketchy 
late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The first explosion occurred at 12:49 a.m. at the Lancer's cocktail lounge on 
Park Boulevard in North Park, police said. 
</P>
<P>
According to an employee, someone tossed an explosive device through the side 
door of the bar, stunning the 60 or so New Year's revelers present. No one was 
injured, said the employee, who added that it took 20 minutes for the smoke to 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
At 1:12 a.m., Fire Capt. William Middleton said, a pipe bomb exploded in the 
3200 block of Myrtle Avenue in the City Heights section. The powerful blast 
blew the glass out of doors and windows at the Park Villa Market. 
</P>
<P>
At 3:38 a.m., Middleton said, explosives destroyed a mailbox in the 1000 block 
of 30th Street, scattering mail on the street. U.S. Postal Service officials 
were investigating. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 6 a.m., a device -- evidently a large firecracker -- was set off 
near a downtown bench on C Street where a man was apparently sleeping. The man 
received minor injuries, Middleton said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police also reported a loud explosion at 1:04 a.m. in the 4000 block 
of Alabama Street in North Park, but no other details were available.

MAN FOUND SHOT TO DEATH IN SANTEE GARAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unidentified man was found shot to death Monday in a garage in Santee, and 
San Diego County Sheriff's Department investigators were questioning three 
residents at the house. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Kim Carson said deputies were called to the home in the 10100 block of 
Magnolia Avenue about 7 a.m. by one of the residents, who dialed 911 and 
reported a shooting at that location. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies found a dead man in the garage, apparently the victim of a gunshot. 
His identity was not released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said three occupants of the house were removed for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
"It is believed one of the occupants may have fired the weapon, but the 
circumstances around the shooting are not yet known," Carson said.

SALVADORAN WITNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times editorial on Dec. 15 ("Will Peace Be Given A Chance?") suggested that 
if two fundamentally important points agreed to at the Central American 
Presidents summit were honored, "this could go a long way toward ending the 
civil war in El Salvador and the Contra war in Nicaragua." The two points are: 
(1) that he FMLN rebels resume negotiations with Salvadoran President 
Cristiani, and (2) that the U.S. stop supporting the Contras and instead devote 
its aid to disbanding them. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Salvadoran war, however, resumption of negotiations would 
only put the parties back on square one, where they were before the rebel 
military offensive started last month. In the negotiations taking place shortly 
before the offensive began, the Salvadoran government negotiators refused to 
accept any proposals for changes oriented toward democratization, economic 
reform, greater social justice, or an end to repression. Instead the government 
launched a series of attacks against churches, peace and human rights groups, 
labor unions, the university, and other elements of the popular movement. 
</P>
<P>
As long as the tiny, wealthy Salvadoran oligarchy and the military refuse to 
change the grossly unequal, unjust socioeconomic system and refuse to end the 
barbaric repression with which they maintain the system, the Salvadoran civil 
war will continue. And as long as the U.S. continues to send massive amounts of 
economic and military aid to maintain the Salvadoran system, the oligarchy and 
the military will cling to their wealth and power and refuse to make 
concessions or to permit reforms.

WEARING FUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I wear fur and I wear it proudly. As an American, I have the right whether to 
wear fur, or leather shoes, or eat chicken. 
</P>
<P>
I'm tired of the shock-wave media and propaganda of animal activists. And I'm 
horrified that they will destroy property ("Animal Activists Blamed in Wide 
Ranch Sabotage," Nov. 19) to get their message across. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, I found out exactly how the fur industry operates, its role in the 
conservation of our natural habitats and species, and no difference in the 
raising of fur or chicken, and the trapping of animals to prevent 
overpopulation and spread of disease. I am educated, I care about ecology, I 
care about the survival of our planet, and in having a choice, I'm wearing my 
decision.

SPECTER OF FAMINE IN ETHIOPIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A famine as grave as that of 1985 is threatening 5 million Ethiopians, 
prompting a global appeal for help from United Nations Secretary General Javier 
Perez de Cuellar. There has been a quick response from the United States and 
the European Community, but the effectiveness of the relief mission is clouded 
by civil strife in that country and restrictions imposed by the Ethiopian 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Food supplies in the northern provinces will be exhausted in the first months 
of the new year, according to an assessment by the U.N. Food and Agriculture 
Organization. The impact of the drought has been made worse by the continuing 
warfare being waged between government forces and guerrilla organizations in 
both Tigre, where the drought is worst, and Eritrea. 
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian officials have approved a flow of aid to rebel-controlled territory 
but only through the Joint Relief Program, a consortium of Ethiopian relief 
groups. This will facilitate the flow of American aid which is sent through 
Catholic Relief Services, an agency working closely with the joint program. But 
thus far the Ethiopian government has not approved the flow of aid from the 
International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations into the northern 
provinces where the civil warfare is raging. 
</P>
<P>
The initial American commitment of 165,000 metric tons of grains is about 
one-fifth of the estimated total food aid needed for 1990. In addition, the 
United States is providing food assistance to three other African food crisis 
areas, Sudan, Mozambique and Angola, all three caught in devastating civil 
strife. 
</P>
<P>
Deterioration of the food situation in Ethiopia comes at a time when developing 
nations throughout the world are falling behind in food production. This year, 
cereal production in the nations of Africa, Asia and Latin America increased 
only 1%, substantially less than population growth.

PLUGGING THE DROPOUT HOLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All junior high school students face the universal adolescent anxiety of 
fitting in. In the Southland, many also face problems like persistent poverty, 
abuse, a new language, a new step-parent or their own new baby. No wonder so 
many drop out. 
</P>
<P>
The junior high dropout rate was 7.4% in the Los Angeles public schools last 
year with more than 8,000 students calling it quits because of sex, drugs, 
alcohol, crime or because they were illiterate and bored. 
</P>
<P>
Those dropouts needed help, but not enough was available. What is available 
reaches only a lucky few. The state spends more than $12 million to keep 
high-risk students in school, primarily in urban school districts like Los 
Angeles and Santa Ana in Orange County, but that is only enough money to reach 
hundreds of students when the need is in the tens of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District supplements state funding of nearly $1 
million per year with an additional $400,000, enough to help an average of only 
100 students on 32 campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Motivating students who are at risk is expensive but worthwhile. The schools 
involved in the state dropout effort have been effective in reducing dropout 
rates, increasing attendance and improving academic achievement, according to a 
preliminary evaluation completed last week. 
</P>
<P>
Helping more youngsters on the verge of dropping out is just one aspect of the 
problem. More must be done at the start of the education process to keep 
students from reaching that point. Early efforts must be made to help 
youngsters form good habits. Take something as simple as paying closer 
attention to a student's attendance record. Perfect attendance is hard to 
achieve. Only one pupil out of four in the kindergarten classes at Garvanza 
Elementary School in Highland Park came close in any given month last year. The 
poor showing prompted the dropout prevention counselor to bring a thermometer 
to school and teach kindergarten pupils to stay home only when they are sick, 
not when they want to go shopping with a parent. Attendance improved. Nearly 
one-third attended school every day last month. Such early intervention is 
essential because problems that start in elementary school can exacerbate in 
junior high. 
</P>
<P>
To overcome another problem -- the switch from the small pond of elementary 
school to the ocean of junior high campuses -- El Sereno Junior High in 
northeast Los Angeles has grouped together 97 seventh-graders to form what is 
in effect a school within a school. Within the comfortable confines of the 
small group, the students get to know their teachers and classmates; their 
teachers get to know them. After one year, the close-knit group tends to have 
slightly better grades and a better outlook about school, solid antidotes to 
the temptation to drop out. 
</P>
<P>
El Sereno and other schools with dropout programs can refer failing youngsters 
to a student study team. The team, which includes parents, counselors and 
teachers, tries to correct mistakes without blaming the child. No meeting 
begins with a scolding. Each session begins with a look at a potential 
dropout's strengths, which are not always obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Junior high students often need close attention simply because they are at a 
difficult stage. They rarely get it. Special dropout programs are providing 
that attention for students at a few schools in Los Angeles. An expanded state 
dropout program would give even more youngsters a chance, a goal that Gov. 
George Deukmejian and the Legislature should put high on their agendas for 
1990.

IF THE COLLAPSE OF MARRIAGE IS NOBODY'S 'FAULT,' WHY DO WOMEN PAY?; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: TWENTY YEARS AGO, CALIFORNIA MOVED TO MAKE DIVORCE RATIONAL, EVEN 
CIVILIZED. ENTER THE HORROR STORIES.

<P>
At the very end of "The War of the Roses," Danny de Vito delivers the moral to 
his cautionary tale about the mutually assured destruction of a marriage. 
"Civilized divorce," he concludes, "is a contradiction in terms." 
</P>
<P>
This is more than a punch line to the movie. It may serve as the footnote to 
that product of wishful thinking and right-minded reform that marks its 20th 
anniversary this week: no-fault divorce. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1970, the state of California put into effect a kind of peace 
treaty. No-fault divorce was to end the use of the courtroom as a battleground 
between divorcing parties. 
</P>
<P>
Until that moment, divorce in America was for the most part awarded only after 
one party was proved to be guilty for ending the marriage. This was a messy and 
often deceitful process to prove that one person was at fault, guilty of 
adultery or cruelty, and that there were "grounds" for divorce. 
</P>
<P>
In a legislative sweep of the hand, California eliminated fault as the grounds 
for divorce, or for awarding alimony, or for dividing property, which was to be 
split equally. The law, signed by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan, was hailed as the 
first step to making divorce rational, equitable, modern, quick and, yes, 
civilized. 
</P>
<P>
Where California led, the country followed. In relatively rapid order, no-fault 
divorce became common in every state. And so, too, more slowly, did the horror 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Wallerstein, the author of "Second Chances," says now from the vantage 
point of two decades, "How little we anticipated what the results might be. We 
passed legislation without a sufficient attempt to foresee the consequences." 
</P>
<P>
What were the consequences? No-fault divorce did make the legal process less 
scandalous. But the new law and the loss of the old bargaining chip, fault, 
contributed to an economic disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Lenore Weitzman's seminal book, "The Divorce Revolution," was the first to 
document the real-life effect of the law in California. "No fault was taken to 
mean no responsibility," says Weitzman, now a sociology professor at Harvard. 
The results were "a systematic impoverishment of women and children." 
</P>
<P>
In the early flush of feminism, the law presumed and the judges rigorously, 
even ruthlessly, implemented the idea that women should be able to support 
themselves, even if they'd been out of the work force for years. The strict 
equal treatment of economic unequals was financially disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
Alimony or spousal support diminished in amount and length. Ordered to divide 
property equally, couples had to sell homes, taking children away from their 
old neighborhoods and schools. There was no allowance made for the one real 
economic asset of a modern marriage: present and future earning power. 
</P>
<P>
"No-fault was the vehicle or the excuse for saying that what happened in the 
past didn't matter, what matters is that you divide up the property and each go 
your own way, "says Weitzman. " Judges used it to cut women off." 
</P>
<P>
To this day, economists argue about how much no-fault divorce added to the 
plight of women and children. But they all agree it was a factor. Today, 
nationally, five years after divorce, a woman's income is still 30% of what it 
was during the marriage. A man's income is 14% more. 
</P>
<P>
Now there is a movement to reform the reform. The movement says that no fault 
is not the same as no responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Once again California has been among the first to experiment. It has, among 
other things, revised the standards for spousal support and the duration of 
that support. Equally important, it is changing judicial attitudes about 
property division that forced the sale of children's homes. 
</P>
<P>
Across the country, the second wave is pointed not only at a more viable 
spousal support, but also at enforcing child-support decrees. There is heated 
discussion as well about whether business assets and professional credentials 
should be considered "marital property" upon divorce. 
</P>
<P>
But this reform wave, like the last one, takes place in a larger context. Today 
most families need two incomes. When one family becomes two single households, 
there is rarely enough. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, for all the rhetoric and real change, most women still enter marriage 
earning less. They often go on earning less throughout marriage and especially 
motherhood. And so they leave a marriage earning less. 
</P>
<P>
There are limits to how much any divorce law can make up for the inequities of 
a whole society. The old reforms continued and even exaggerated those 
inequities. All these reforms can try to do, as Weitzman puts it, is to see at 
least that husband and wife "both share the burdens of divorce in America." 
</P>
<P>
So a truce signed 20 years ago with high ideals about marital peace and 
domestic justice and gender equality has come up against economic reality and 
more than a touch of emotional cynicism. It just may be that a civilized 
divorce law is also a contradiction in terms.

JUSTICE FOR NORIEGA ISN'T IN THE CARDS; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: OLLIE NORTH'S CLOAK OF DISPENSATIONS WOULD FIT THE GENERAL JUST AS WELL. 
THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T AFFORD TO TRY HIM -- OR TO LET HIM FREE.

<P>
The one country we can be certain Manuel Noriega will not ask to be sent to is 
Romania. The new revolutionary government's concept of justice -- secret 
"trial," no appeal, quick execution -- is unlikely to appeal to Noriega's sense 
of survival. 
</P>
<P>
Like many tyrants of the past, Noriega will be seeking a peaceful and luxurious 
retirement. And if history is a guide to the future, he will find some fellow 
dictator willing to extend him a professional courtesy. Among the modern 
precedents is the hospitality extended to mass murderer Idi Amin by Saudi 
Arabia, and the welcome mat rolled out for Nazi war criminals by Paraguay and 
Syria. Even civilized countries like the United States and France have given 
sanctuary to despots -- like the Shah of Iran, Ferdinand Marcos and Jean-Claude 
"Baby Doc" Duvalier, wanted for trial in their own countries. 
</P>
<P>
Administration sources, pointing to Noriega's indictment on drug charges, have 
tried to distinguish the case by arguing that he is "a common criminal." But 
the Shah, Marcos and Duvalier were also regarded as criminals by their own 
people. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that we sent in the U.S. Army to capture Noriega weakens our claim 
that he is a "common criminal" as distinguished from a political opponent. He 
may well be both. The U.S. government certainly did not regard him as a common 
criminal when our CIA worked hand-in-hand with him over a considerable number 
of years. We treated him as the powerful political figure he was. He may have 
been an s.o.b., but as Franklin Roosevelt once said of another U.S.-supported 
Central American dictator: "At least he's our s.o.b." 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Noriega is no longer our s.o.b., but he apparently knows a lot about 
other s.o.b.'s with whom we are, and have been, dealing. He also knows about 
our CIA operations throughout Central and South America. It is for this reason 
that knowledgeable sources are doubting that President Bush really wants him to 
be tried in an American court. Under the rules of evidence, Noriega's lawyers 
could demand disclosure of highly embarrassing government files. If our 
intelligence services refuse to produce those files, the charges against 
Noriega might have to be dropped, as several charges were dropped against 
Oliver North, John Poindexter and others. 
</P>
<P>
The difference is that the Bush Administration and the Central Intelligence 
Agency wanted the charges dropped against North and Poindexter. They used the 
cloak of national security as an excuse for helping their friends. Noriega is 
nobody's friend. The last thing the Administration wants now is a trial in an 
American court that results in a dismissal of charges against him. Our legal 
system is based on precedents. The crowning irony would be for the precedent 
established in the case of hero Ollie North to be used to free villain Manuel 
Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
There were many officials in Washington who were hoping that Noriega would 
suffer the fate of Nicolae Ceausescu, the Romanian dictator executed by his own 
army, or of Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, the Medellin drug boss killed in a 
shootout. 
</P>
<P>
Short of Noriega being killed, the next best outcome for the Administration may 
well be the one that is currently playing itself out. The problem is now 
squarely in the hands of the Vatican. No one expects us to use gunboat 
diplomacy on the nunciature. Our hands are tied. We did the best we could. Or 
did we? Is it possible that Noriega's all-too-obvious Vatican option did not 
occur to a single Washington official? Could we not have surrounded the 
nunciature to prevent Noriega from sneaking in? Or did we really close our eyes 
to this possibility? 
</P>
<P>
It's not too late to get our hands on the fugitive who has continued to make a 
fool of us. We can simply wait him out. Although international law may forbid 
us from physically entering the nunciature and grabbing Noriega, he remains 
subject to capture as soon as he tries to leave. Cars, helicopters and 
airplanes -- even those bearing the seal of the Vatican -- are not the 
"territory" of the Vatican as the nunciature is. If the Vatican were to decide 
to allow Noriega to seek asylum in Cuba or some other country, we need not 
allow him safe passage. 
</P>
<P>
Remember that not so long ago, we forcibly stopped an Egyptian aircraft 
carrying terrorists and made it land in Italy, where the terrorists were 
apprehended. We could do the same with Noriega. But there are many who believe 
that we will not do everything in our legal, diplomatic and military power to 
see to it that Noriega is brought to trial in a America. courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
As a Noriega lawyer put it to me: "They know that the case of the United States 
vs. Manuel Noriega would really turn out to be the case of Manuel Noriega vs. 
the CIA, Ronald Reagan and George Bush."

MISSING GIRL SPOTTED AT A THIRD REST STOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The search for Leticia Hernandez was given new promise Monday when a witness 
reported seeing the 7-year-old Oceanside girl with a man and woman at a highway 
rest stop near El Paso, Tex., police said. 
</P>
<P>
The report brings to three the number of sightings of the girl, who has been 
missing since Dec. 16 from her home in the 1300 block of Bush Street. "It 
really gives us new hope," said Mary Jane Midstokk, an Oceanside police 
officer. "It's a positive sign." 
</P>
<P>
A child matching Leticia's description was first spotted at a Buckman Springs 
rest stop on Interstate 8 in east San Diego County on the day of her 
disappearance, but the witness did not report the sighting until five days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
A second sighting occurred Wednesday morning and was reported within 24 hours. 
In that incident, several witnesses reported seeing a girl resembling Leticia 
at the San Simon rest stop on Interstate 10 in Arizona, just west of New 
Mexico. The girl was seen with a man and a woman, and witnesses said she 
appeared distraught, scared and intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest sighting, which occurred about 4:30 a.m. Friday, the girl was 
seen at a third rest stop, this one east of El Paso on Interstate 10. A witness 
told authorities Monday that he saw the girl leave the ladies bathroom and 
return to an older car. A man was in the car, but police said the witness did 
not get a good description of him. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the woman accompanying the girl was described as a white female, 
mid-30s, 5 feet, 10 inches tall, about 130 pounds, with dirty blond 
collar-length hair. The car was described as a dirty maroon midsize sedan, 
possibly a 1975 or 1976 model. 
</P>
<P>
"They were in the female restroom, they were out of the car and using the 
facilities." said Sgt. Bill Krunglevich of the Oceanside Police. "The 
indication we have is that the girl seemed to be OK and in the company of the 
female." 
</P>
<P>
The woman, the girl and the vehicle match descriptions given in the San Simon 
sighting, police said. Police also noted that the couple is moving the girl 
eastward to an undetermined location. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears to be a continuation of the same sightings, with one male and one 
female and the vehicle, along with the young girl, in an easterly direction on 
the interstate," Krunglevich said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that a photograph of Leticia and a composite drawing of the woman had 
been shown on west Texas television stations Thursday night, and that the El 
Paso witness apparently saw the pictures on TV before the sighting. 
</P>
<P>
Police are attempting to get more public service announcements on television 
stations in Houston and Dallas, as well as stations in Louisiana and Arkansas, 
on the belief that the couple will continue eastward. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still pushing with the media," Krunglevich said. "We're still working 
with the FBI. And now we're working hard in the state of Texas." 
</P>
<P>
He hopes police can catch up with the little girl. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems they're heading east on an extremely slow pace," he said. "They're 
moving very slow, always on the interstate, always pulling off at interstate 
rest stops." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information about the case should call Oceanside Police at 
966-4911.

Coastal and inland winds may reach 25 m.p.h. tonight, and up to 30 m.p.h. in 
the mountain areas. Mountains in San Diego County should receive anywhere from 
6 inches to 1 foot of snow today at the 5,000-feet level. 
</P>
<P>
The showers and cloudiness will decrease tonight and early Wednesday morning, 
when the storm system heads east. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the temperatures will remain cool, with the coastal and inland areas 
experiencing highs ranging 57 to 63 degrees, dropping overnight to 46 to 51 on 
the coast and to 38 to 46 inland. 
</P>
<P>
Daytime temperatures in the mountains will range 36 to 44 and fall to 26 to 34 
degrees at night. The deserts will reach 58 to 66 degrees today and have 
overnight lows of 38 to 46. 
</P>
<P>
The surf is 3 to 6 feet at 13 second intervals, with occasional breakers as 
high as 8 feet. The water temperature is a brisk 59 degrees.

Sajak Buys W-E-D: The host of "Wheel of Fortune" and CBS's late-night talk show 
has a new role: husband. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Sajak, 42, married Lesly Brown, 24, in a private service late on New Year's 
Eve in Annapolis, Md. The Baltimore Sun reports the newlyweds ducked in a side 
door of St. Mary's Catholic Church to avoid about two dozen onlookers, and -- 
after a service featuring a 25-piece orchestra -- left with similar stealth. 
Sajak fans waiting in the rain outside the church were mollified, however, by a 
glimpse of Vanna White, Sajak's "Wheel of Fortune" co-star. Claudia Puig

After-Christmas Present: The La Jolla Playhouse is facing a cheerier new year, 
thanks to a $400,000 gift from the Joan B. Kroc Foundation. Kroc is the widow 
of Ray Kroc, founder of McDonald's. The grant, which enabled the Playhouse to 
balance its 1989 operations budget, is separate from the theater's current 
financial stabilization campaign, which is lobbying to raise $1 million by June 
30. Claudia Puig

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : CLASSICAL MUSIC; 
</P>
<P>
OPERA, SYMPHONY CHIEFS HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH HERMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1990s, San Diego's classical music institutions hope to atone for the 
sins of the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
At Symphony Hall, incoming music director Yoav Talmi will undertake the musical 
reconstruction of an orchestra that has been without a music director for three 
years, while executive director Wesley Brustad and board members look for a 
generous donor whose "naming gift" will absorb half of the lingering $4-million 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
Ian Campbell, having put San Diego Opera's house in fiscal order, is more 
concerned with righting the sins of omission (mainly in programming) over the 
last decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Our immediate challenge is to include 20th-Century repertory in our seasons as 
a matter of course," said Campbell, the opera's general director. "Not that the 
company hasn't done this repertory in the past, but we've had no regular diet 
to allow our audiences to grow into newer operas. As we enter the last decade 
of the century, we need to do a gentle catch-up." 
</P>
<P>
Not only is Campbell promising 20th-Century opera in every season -- and he 
insisted that he means operas more adventuresome than late Puccini and Richard 
Strauss -- he intends to restore American opera to the company's offerings at 
least every other year. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have two 20th-Century operas in 1991, including (American composer) 
Carlisle Floyd's 'The Passion of Jonathan Wade,' with Floyd directing the 
production." Less well-known than Floyd's other operas -- "Susannah" and "Of 
Mice and Men" are his calling cards -- "The Passion of Jonathan Wade" is echt 
Americana, set in South Carolina immediately after the Civil War. Commissioned 
by New York City Opera, the opera was first performed in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a cautious expansion of the company's season at Civic Theatre, 
Campbell sees a five-opera season for the first half of the 1990s and a 
six-opera season by the second half of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
"I see the market place more complex in the 1990s, and we have to be practical 
about expanding," Campbell explained. He noted, however, that the success of 
"Cats," "Les Miserables," and "Phantom of the Opera" on the popular 
contemporary music stage could be beneficial for traditional opera. 
</P>
<P>
"These shows are actually opera in their form, because they are sung all the 
way through with little or no dialogue. They could act as a bridge for people 
who have previously avoided opera and encourage them to try something like 
"Madama Butterfly." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, recently returned from a European scouting mission, had no news to 
report about up-and-coming tenor superstars to add to the performances. He did, 
however, manage to sign the promising young German baritone Hans Peter 
Blochwitz to sing a recital here in October, 1990, which will mark his American 
recital debut. 
</P>
<P>
Other singers Campbell promises in San Diego Opera productions during the 1990s 
include familiar names such as Carol Vaness, Hakan Hagegard, Ashley Putnam and 
Diana Soviero. Among the younger singers, he has signed American tenors Richard 
Leech and Gary Lakes, as well as baritone Thomas Hampson. 
</P>
<P>
"In the coming decade, we will be hiring fewer foreign singers in major roles 
because a new crop of American singers is just now coming into its own." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell also indicated that his company might dabble in the Gilbert and 
Sullivan repertory or include an occasional classic American musical in its 
lineup, although not without first talking with local companies who specialize 
in these areas to ensure that the opera company will undertake complementary 
offerings. He is also keeping his eye on the vacant -- and currently unrestored 
-- Balboa Theater as a potential venue for chamber opera, an alternative season 
geared to appeal to a new audience. 
</P>
<P>
When Campbell pulls out his wish list, the Australian native dreams of a 
dramatic new opera complex on the San Diego harbor, much like the 
architecturally stunning opera house in Sydney. Although with a probable price 
tag of $150 million, Campbell's company is not about to undertake a building 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
For the decade's close, Campbell envisions the company commissioning an opera 
to herald the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
"For a new century, we need to premiere a new opera. San Diego Opera hasn't 
commissioned an opera since Menotti's 'La Loca' (1979). We need to do it as a 
statement." 
</P>
<P>
For the San Diego Symphony, Brustad has concrete plans for the next three to 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, the orchestra will be recording for first time ever on a major 
label. When we start seeing the records in stores, it won't be a big money 
thing, but it will be a significant achievement for the musicians," Brustad 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, Yoav (Talmi) and I are committed to the touring of the orchestra, 
not because we think that we are the Philadelphia Orchestra, but for the 
artistic development of the orchestra's ensemble by playing in other venues in 
different cities. Touring also brings back good will here to the city. If 
people here in town read in an out-of-town newspaper, 'These guys played like 
angels,' then they're more than just the hometown boys." 
</P>
<P>
Concerning changes in the orchestra's programming, the ball is now in Talmi's 
court. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a wide repertory," Brustad noted, "but I'm curious to see how it will 
play in the first couple of years. It's different to talk about varied 
programming and then get into the music director's chair, where you're the one 
who's going to be shot at. You tend to tighten up a little bit. It will be 
interesting for me to see how he maneuvers his way through. I know that he does 
not want to isolate contemporary music into a single series by itself, 
however." 
</P>
<P>
Brustad's biggest hope for the decade is to move from Hospitality Point on 
Mission Bay into a new home for the symphony's summer concerts. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've got out there is cute and nice, but it's a little temporary. After 
eight years, we need something more substantial, a larger, permanent venue on 
the water that will allow us to move toward more of a Hollywood Bowl venue and 
program." 
</P>
<P>
According to Brustad, he is not simply empire building. This type of summer 
facility with income-producing events augmenting the pops programs is essential 
for the orchestra's future economic stability. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see this town supporting its orchestra like they do in Boston. It's 
simple as the weather. It's just too nice to live here, which is why the summer 
pops works so beautifully -- it's outdoors. You don't fight the weather; you're 
part of it."

CULT: PAINFUL SINCERITY AMID THE RIFFS

After opening with the "one day a rain's gonna come and wash all the scum off 
the streets" rap popularized by a certain former taxi driver, the Cult 
kerranng! in the New Year before a capacity crowd at the Long Beach Arena. 
Balloons cascaded from the ceiling as the Cult tossed off a 
learned-it-at-soundcheck version of "Auld Lang Syne" that was distinguishable 
from the rest of the set by virtue of its once having had a memorable melody. 
</P>
<P>
Cheap joke. After all, the British hard-rock quartet has at least 30 minutes of 
solid material, as demonstrated throughout the course of its 90-minute set. 
</P>
<P>
Having devolved from gloom-doom boomers to college radio faves for the usual 
three days to the ele-metal rock band with two gold LPs, these big-noise boys 
can now truck around a big-time stage set-up, complete with a light truss that 
rotates at big moments to reveal a big red Maltese cross, but they really don't 
need the spectacle. The energy they expend running around striking poses alone 
could've lit up the whole city of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, guitarist Billy Duffy played nothin' but racket. Bassist Jamie 
Stewart -- another minimalist -- and this year's tour drummer were as tight as 
the space between the blocks of the pyramids and about as solid, and vocalist 
Ian Astbury carried on as if he were Jim Morrison's baby brother, the 
Salamander Prince himself. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of rock offspring, Bonham -- the British quartet led by drummer Jason 
Bonham, son o' late Led Zeppelin drummer John -- preceded the Cult with a 
50-minute set that sounded alternately like his father and Foreigner-type radio 
fodder (the hit "Wait for You"). These Led Clones might have a (birth)right to 
the sound, but the shameless "my dad was blah-blah-blah and I'm gonna do this 
one for him" rap before the rendition of the Zep's magnificent "Black Dog" 
(lowlighted by the guitarist's leaving about half the solo's notes in the 
dressing room) must've had dad rockin' -- but mostly rollin' over -- in his 
grave. That is, if the rip-off of "Kashmir" hadn't already flipped pop's top. 
</P>
<P>
The Cult, of course, has its own rip-off of "Kashmir." Laying on the '60s 
imagery with a hod full of soul, it's also got a song about deceased Warhol 
scenemaker Edie Sedgwick, written as a cautionary drug tale. It's that crazy 
combination of flagrant riff-lifting and painful sincerity that makes the Cult 
the closest thing pop music has to the Troggs nowadays. Can't wait for the 
bootlegs of the studio bickering to surface. DON WALLER

Matisse Works Stolen: A cat burglar stole eight works by French master Henri 
Matisse worth $12.5 million from the artist's former apartment in Nice, police 
said Monday. The works include the celebrated oil paintings "View Over the Port 
of Collioure," "Woman in Brittany" and "Devilacqua." 
</P>
<P>
Police said the plush apartment located in the hills overlooking the 
Mediterranean was Matisse's home from 1938 until his death in 1954, but it had 
not been lived in regularly for more than 20 years. According to police 
sources, the apartment and paintings were bequeathed jointly to Matisse's 
heirs, who had been unable to agree on how the legacy should be divided. The 
painter's daughter-in-law, Maria Matisse, discovered the theft. The thief 
climbed up the front of the building, broke a window to get into the 
third-floor apartment and cut five oils, two pencil drawings and an etching 
from their frames, police said. The collection of works kept at the apartment 
are well known and police said it would be difficult for the thieves to sell 
them on the legitimate art market. Claudia Puig

68 ARRESTED, 8 HURT IN NEW YEAR'S GUNFIRE;

<P>
SHOOTINGS: POLICE SAY A PUBLIC INFORMATION CAMPAIGN DID CUT DOWN ON THE 
SOMETIMES DEADLY TRADITION. BUT SHOTS STILL RANG OUT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY.

<P>
Betty Green could scarcely believe her eyes and ears when she drove onto her 
street just after midnight Monday on her way home from a church meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of men and women, Green's neighbors, were standing in the street, 
shooting into the air and taking potshots at street lights, even blasting the 
limbs off magnolia trees lining West 53rd Street in South Los Angeles. Some of 
the revelers burned Christmas trees in the fog-shrouded road. 
</P>
<P>
Green, 60, said she sat quaking in her parked car for 10 minutes, then sprinted 
into her house. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guns went boom so loud the whole house vibrated," Green recalled a few 
hours later. "I said, 'This is too much.' " 
</P>
<P>
It was a scene played out -- albeit to a lesser degree, in most cases -- in 
many parts of the county, as once again New Year's in Los Angeles produced 
outbursts of random gunfire that could be heard from Watts to Beverly Hills. 
Celebrants, many of them tipsy, shot wildly skyward, into the ground and, 
occasionally, at each other. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement campaigns to end the sometimes deadly tradition, coupled with 
threats of felony prosecution, apparently did curb the gunfire somewhat Sunday 
night and Monday morning and led to more arrests. Los Angeles police arrested 
37 people on felony charges of discharging weapons in a reckless manner. The 
Sheriff's Department arrested 31. 
</P>
<P>
Countywide, at least eight people were injured in the gunfire, two by Los 
Angeles police officers who say the celebrants, taken by surprise, fired on 
them with a shotgun. Scores of weapons were confiscated throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
To curb the gunfire this year, LAPD Deputy Chief William Rathburn said, the 
department devised a plan that included the deployment of hundreds of officers 
in cars and on foot, especially in South Los Angeles and the Rampart and 
Hollenbeck divisions, where police say most of the shooting occurs. 
</P>
<P>
During December, flyers discouraging New Year's Eve shooting were distributed 
to schoolchildren and posted in businesses all over the city. The flyers 
included a telephone hot line that residents could use to identify shooters to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
All through the day on New Year's Eve, unprecedented numbers of officers were 
deployed in two of the city's largest housing projects, Nickerson Gardens and 
Jordan Downs, and in nearby Imperial Courts. The amount of shooting in all 
three, particularly in the early evening, was significantly lower than last 
year, most officers interviewed said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said some of the heaviest gunfire this year occurred in the southeast 
corner of the city. Heavy gunfire was also reported in the Wilshire area and in 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"From everything we can see," the police media campaign "was largely 
successful," Police Department spokesman Bill Frio said. "What we'd like is to 
have nobody shooting in the air. But it may take years before we can get 
everybody to stop." As midnight approached, citizens -- and even police 
officers -- sought refuge from the falling lead by staying indoors or parking 
their vehicles in isolated areas and under freeway overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
Bennie Townsend, 40, of Compton sat with a friend inside a car parked behind 
his newly painted blue Mack truck, beneath an overpass on Central Avenue in 
Watts at 11:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Last New Year's Eve, Townsend said, the truck was hit near the engine and 
suffered $600 worth of damage. "I can't see any bullets going through it again 
-- not this year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not far away, in a truck terminal, officers sat in two cars that had been 
parked close to huge trailers. During the worst of the barrage, bullets could 
be heard zinging against the trailers and crashing through trees. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that's good-natured celebrating," mused Capt. Stephen Gates of 
the Southeast Division as someone repeatedly fired a semiautomatic weapon 
nearby. Seconds later, a bullet kicked up gravel a few feet away from the cars. 
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of deaths anywhere in Los Angeles County. In the city of 
Los Angeles, there were no reports of injuries from errant bullets. One of the 
men shot by police, Thedeus Jenkins, 18, was hit in the buttocks with shotgun 
pellets. His companion, a 16-year-old whose name was not released, was hit by 
pellets in the face. Both were held on suspicion of assaulting a police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
The six injuries in areas under the sheriff's jurisdiction included a 
3-year-old girl who was hit in the leg as her father held her in his arms in 
the Florence area, and a pregnant woman who was grazed in the back as she was 
tending a back yard barbecue in the Willowbrook area. A Bellflower man was hit 
in the thigh and ankle by ricocheting bullets his neighbor had fired into the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the arrests in the city occurred Monday morning after citizens called 
police and reported that their neighbors had been shooting. Police and deputy 
district attorneys had set up a command post to prepare arrest warrants and 
process those hauled in. 
</P>
<P>
On one street in South-Central Los Angeles on Monday morning, children ran 
through the block filling their pockets with spent shotgun and rifle shells. 
Nearby, a 19-year-old man who spoke on condition his name not be used boasted 
that he had fired a M-1 rifle and a .38-caliber pistol into the air and at 
street lights. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're not shooting a gun on New Year's Eve, you shouldn't be outside," 
said the young man, standing beside a mound of spent shells and wine bottles 
swept up by neighbors. "Shooting up in the air? There's nobody up there. 
Besides, by the time the bullets get up there, they're not going to hurt 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing could be further from the truth, say police officers, pointing out that 
what goes up must come down. At least five people in recent years have been 
killed by bullets that hit them on their way to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Officers say a bullet fired into the air can travel more than a mile and fall 
to the ground at nearly the same velocity it left the muzzle. That is more than 
enough speed to pierce a body, even a roof. 
</P>
<P>
The LAPD's Gates said that traditionally, the shooting is done by normally 
law-abiding people who have been drinking alcohol.

VIOLATORS TAKE NOTICE OF BILLS FOR REMOVING POSTERS; 
</P>
<P>
ADVERTISING: 528 RESIDENTS WERE ASSESSED CHARGES FOR REMOVING THEIR NAILED AND 
THUMBTACKED SIGNS FROM PUBLIC PROPERTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
On a warm afternoon last October, Woodland Hills resident Richard Linder 
carefully printed "House for Rent" on six pieces of 8 1/2-by-11-inch paper, 
stuffed a box of thumbtacks in his pocket and drove around Van Nuys pinning the 
sheets on telephone poles. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a stunned Linder discovered that the mundane task would cost him 
$194.20. "Your signs have been illegally posted," stated a city letter that 
ordered the 63-year-old contractor to pay a high price for creating "blighted 
conditions" in his community. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked. I'm just a little guy trying to rent a house," Linder said. "I 
freely admit I hung the signs. But this seems like a severe penalty for tacking 
a sign on a pole." 
</P>
<P>
Linder is among 528 Los Angeles lawbreakers, who have received the first batch 
of costly bills from the Los Angeles Department of Public Works as part of an 
aggressive new law enforcement program in which city crews are tearing away 
illegally posted signs and billing offenders for the removal service. 
</P>
<P>
The days of stapling, nailing and taping "Garage Sale," "For Sale" and even 
"Lost Dog" signs on telephone and street light poles are over, said public 
works officials. The city aims to slap heavy fees on lawbreakers -- homeowners, 
big developers and entrepreneurs alike -- to deter them from what has long been 
a widespread practice. 
</P>
<P>
"You can no longer use public property as a free form of advertising," said 
Patrick D. Howard, director of the Public Works Department's Bureau of Street 
Maintenance. "This type of blight is offensive to a vast majority of the 
population. It is visual pollution. Our goal is to stop it." 
</P>
<P>
The tough law, approved by the City Council last August, was born of vehement 
complaints from San Fernando Valley and Westside homeowners who scorn the 
multitude of real estate and other signs that clutter city streets. At times 
over the past three years, anger has reached such heights that self-proclaimed 
"sign vigilantes" roved streets in the Valley and elsewhere ripping down outlaw 
posters to protest weak city sign ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
Although tacking signs on public property has been a misdemeanor offense for 
more than 40 years, city officials had to actually catch an offender in the act 
to bring charges. Only a handful of violators had been prosecuted in the last 
few years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
There are about half a million illegally posted signs citywide on any given 
day, a figure arrived at through a sample survey of busy thoroughfares, street 
maintenance officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The new law, introduced by north Valley Councilman Hal Bernson, established a 
principle called "rebuttable presumption," which assumes that the person 
benefiting from the sign can be held responsible for paying the cost of its 
removal. 
</P>
<P>
So, in Linder's case, as well as in scores of others involving everything from 
dance hall operators to religious organizations, 16 city work crews have torn 
and peeled away signs, tracked down the owners and billed the party for the 
cost of the removal job. Officials said the law applies equally to political 
candidates who post election placards. 
</P>
<P>
The first sign, regardless of its size, costs $190.40 to remove, an amount 
calculated by city accountants who tabulated the cost of a two-man crew, their 
new van, equipment and staff time to find the offender. Each additional sign 
costs $1.60 to remove because the crew is already on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Those who use glue to paste up signs will be charged $48.50 for each additional 
removal because it takes crews longer to scrape the paper away with a chemical 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
A two-person crew dons hard hats, gloves and goggles to remove up to 300 signs 
a day. And the work can be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"All these staples and nails can come popping out at you," said Juan Reyes, 30, 
of Arleta who often uses a shovel or crowbar to pry off stubborn nailed-in 
posters. 
</P>
<P>
The workers take a Polaroid camera snapshot of the illegal posters for evidence 
and write down the information such as names, addresses and phone numbers on 
the sign. This is turned over to an inspector who tracks down and then bills 
the owner. 
</P>
<P>
In the first Dec. 15 billing, the city has charged offenders a total of 
$119,108 for their misdeeds. Officials hope to collect more than $600,000 in 
fines this year to pay for the cost of running the program. So far, only $1,847 
has been paid. Misdemeanor criminal charges may be filed against those who fail 
to pay within 30 days, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
Many incensed violators claim they did not know the law was in place and have 
demanded first-offender leniency. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, said Rabbi Boruch Shlomo Cunin, of Chabad House in North Hollywood and 
West Los Angeles, the city will not charge his charitable organization $408 for 
posting dozens of "L'chayim to Life" telethon posters around town. "I intend to 
come to the hearing and bring the 1,000 posters we did not hang to show them 
since we became aware of the illegality of this," Cunin said. "We are a 
charitable organization that helps the homeless. We hope the city will be very 
kind to us and waive the fees." 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they have been merciful to a few first-time offenders -- 
such as parents of children who hung up lost puppy signs and homeowners who 
hung garage sale signs. 
</P>
<P>
"I sent them a warning letter," said John Kissler, the West Valley inspector. 
"But if there is a second offense, they will be charged." 
</P>
<P>
But profit-takers beware. City officials said they have little sympathy for 
business people who use public property for personal gain. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going after people who post signs for commercial purposes as part of 
their business operations," said William E. White, chief street-use inspector. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Graves, a co-owner of Economy Electrical and Plumbing of Sun Valley, has 
been charged $388 for distributing about 200 signs advertising "Plumber 
Services" throughout the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"The business we got from those signs kept us from going under when we started 
up last August," Graves said. "It was a cheap, effective and easy way to let 
people know we were out there." 
</P>
<P>
Since receiving the bill, Graves dispatched workers to remove his remaining 
signs. He said he intends to write off the charges as "the cost of doing 
business." 
</P>
<P>
"I just wish we could have gotten some kind of warning that this was against 
the law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But another violator, the owners of about 300 fluorescent-colored signs 
throughout the Valley publicizing "Six Foot and Under Basketball," say they 
plan to fight their $816.80 bill. Ray Danish, a partner in the nonprofit Sports 
League, said that the city removal fee is "ridiculous. . . . It only costs us 
15 cents to hang them up. It shouldn't cost the city more than 20 cents to take 
them down. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Danish argued, "Our signs are neat and colorful. They should be 
allowed to stay up." 
</P>
<P>
But for folks like Richard Linder, who was trying to rent out a small house 
with his few hand-made signs, the lesson has been more sobering. 
</P>
<P>
"I know ignorance of the law is no excuse," Linder lamented. "But the bill came 
the day before Christmas. It just seems like such a high cost for my minor 
offense."

DRIVER WHO 'JUST WANTED TO GET HOME' KEEPS GOING IN BURNING, WRECKED CAR 
</P>

The engine was on fire, the windshield was smashed in, two of the tires were 
flat, the roof was partially caved in and the right front side was ripped open. 
But Goorgen Hukassians of Saugus managed to drive his car about a mile in a 
vain attempt to get home after an accident Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like it," said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy 
Steve Grossman of the Santa Clarita Valley Substation. Grossman arrested 
Hukassians at the scene on suspicion of hit-and-run driving, drunk driving and 
damage to city property. 
</P>
<P>
"It's incredible a car in that condition was able to move a foot, let alone as 
far as he got," the deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman said that Hukassians, 22, who was able to walk away from the wrecked 
car, lost control of the Pontiac Fiero soon after he left the Golden State 
Freeway at the Valencia Boulevard exit. 
</P>
<P>
"For unknown reasons, he flips over once or twice -- he said he couldn't 
remember how many times," Grossman said, "and knocks over a fire hydrant near 
Rockwell Canyon Road in front of the College of the Canyons." 
</P>
<P>
But Hukassians managed to keep driving the car up Valencia Boulevard until it 
finally died near Bouquet Canyon Road, Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
A security guard working near the area reported a car on fire to the sheriff's 
office. When Grossman was on his way to the scene, he said, he heard a report 
on his police radio that the fire hydrant had been knocked over and was spewing 
water. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured they were related, and the man who was driving the car did not deny 
hitting the fire hydrant," Grossman said. "But when I asked him why he had 
tried to drive away from the scene, he said, 'I was just trying to get home. I 
just wanted to get home.' "

JUSTICE: JUDGES AND LAWYERS SAY A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS. BUT SOME 
SAY WELL-EDITED VIDEOS CAN MISREPRESENT SITUATIONS. AND SOME LEGAL EXPERTS FEAR 
JURIES MAY GIVE UNDUE WEIGHT TO A VIDEO PRESENTATION.

<P>
In 1937, Josephine Heiman sued the Market Street Railway Co. for damages after 
she was hit by a streetcar in San Francisco. In her lawsuit, she claimed she 
had suffered devastating injuries and was left incapacitated by the incident. 
</P>
<P>
But when the case came to trial, lawyers for the railway showed a film that 
purported to show Heiman going about her normal activities shortly after the 
accident. Influenced by the film, jurors in the case gave the woman a far lower 
financial award than she had sought. 
</P>
<P>
That case demonstrated to lawyers the potential of moving pictures to support 
or contradict the testimony of witnesses in jury trials. But the high cost of 
making a film for use in court generally restricted the practice to wealthy 
parties involved in high-stakes cases. 
</P>
<P>
The development of low-cost video technology, however, has leveled the legal 
playing field. Now, numerous lawyers regularly use videos to help them make 
their cases. Videos reconstructing accidents, demonstrating allegedly faulty 
products and depicting a typical "day in the life" of a plaintiff have become 
common in California civil trials, including cases in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Videos were used recently, for example, in civil trials involving a paralyzed 
woman who was raped in a North Hollywood nursing home, a man injured in a 
Castaic Lake accident and an Encino woman collecting damages against the 
manufacturer of the Dalkon Shield. And lawyers plan to use videos in court in 
the case of a Simi Valley student hit by a car while crossing the street. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes videos are praised for helping jurors draw their own conclusions 
about a person, place or event without having to rely on witnesses' 
descriptions. 
</P>
<P>
"Video makes it possible for someone, even on a limited budget, to come into 
court and show the court what is happening somewhere," said San Fernando 
Superior Court Judge David Schacter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the old saying, a picture is worth a thousand words," said Van Nuys 
Superior Court Judge Thomas Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
Yet judges and lawyers say the recent cases in the Valley indicate that slick, 
well-edited videos can misrepresent situations by taking scenes out of context. 
And some legal experts fear juries may give undue weight to a video 
presentation. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a sense that jurors are able to critically analyze television in 
the same way that they do a live person," said UCLA law school professor Paul 
Bergman, who teaches trial advocacy. 
</P>
<P>
"A lawyer will have to become almost like a film critic," Bergman said. "He 
will have to think about the other side's videotape and how to counter that." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent trial in San Fernando Superior Court, San Diego-based attorney 
David Brennan saw first-hand how easily raw video footage can be slanted to 
make a point. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan was defending Seacrest, the manufacturer of a motorized recreational 
water vehicle known as a wetbike, against a $15-million claim by a man who 
sustained major brain damage and other injuries in a 1982 collision between his 
wetbike and a motorboat on Castaic Lake. Richard S. Brownstein, the plaintiff, 
contended that the collision occurred because the wetbike was unstable and 
uncontrollable. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Brownstein's attorney showed a seven-minute video of a naval 
safety expert riding a wetbike. On the tape, the wetbike jumped out of the 
water several times as it crossed boat wakes. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan called his own expert witness to analyze the tape. The expert said that 
a single sequence during which the rider shook the bike to make it unstable had 
been edited into the tape at several points. Brennan also subpoenaed the 
plaintiff's unedited footage and played it in court. 
</P>
<P>
"We demanded the entire film that he had taken. When they viewed the totality 
of the film, they said, 'This is baloney.' They saw that he was perfectly 
capable of controlling the bike," Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
The jury eventually ruled that the wetbike manufacturer was not liable for 
causing Brownstein's accident. 
</P>
<P>
"Video is a powerful tool in the courts, but it can be manipulated pretty 
easily. Properly used, it can demonstrate truth to the jury. Unfortunately, you 
can do a variety of things to demonstrate something you are trying to prove, 
even if it isn't true," Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
Other legal experts say that a particularly emotional video depicting a 
plaintiff's suffering may impair a jury's ability to rationally consider the 
facts of a case, as perhaps occurred in the case of Andree Nerpel. 
</P>
<P>
Nerpel, a severely brain-damaged woman, was raped and impregnated at the 
Laurelwood nursing home, and her family sued the North Hollywood facility for 
damages. The jury awarded her $7.5 million, but Judge David M. Schacter set 
aside the award because he said there was "not one shred of evidence" that the 
nursing home was negligent in caring for their patient. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Nerpel's attorney played a video of Nerpel as she lay 
helplessly in bed, semi-paralyzed and unable to speak as a result of injuries 
incurred in a 1969 automobile accident. The video showed her lifting her hand 
to grab her grandmother's hand, putting her hands behind her head and becoming 
agitated when a stranger came into the room. 
</P>
<P>
Richard B. Castle, the lawyer who represented the nursing home, said the 
videotape "clouded the issues" 
</P>
<P>
for the jurors, whose decision was based "purely on emotion." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Schacter and Castle agree the video had a place in the court. 
</P>
<P>
"She was the plaintiff in this case, and she had no other way to get here. The 
jury had a right to see that," Schacter said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers and legal video specialists admit that "day in the life" videos, which 
show the injuries sustained by a plaintiff in a civil suit, are designed to 
appeal to jurors' emotions. But, they said, it is important for jurors to 
understand exactly how a plaintiff's life has been affected by the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a documentary," said legal video producer Peter Meilen. 
</P>
<P>
Meilen recently filmed 14-year-old Jennifer Joyce, who was in a coma for 22 
days after she was hit by a car last May while crossing a street behind Sequoia 
Junior High School in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce's family is suing the city and the Simi Valley Unified School District 
for negligence for leaving the school's back gate open, allowing the students 
to cross the street unsupervised. 
</P>
<P>
To dramatize how Joyce's life has been altered since the accident, Meilen 
filmed her as she attended three hours of speech, occupational and physical 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
When Joyce banged her head on the table in frustration at her inability to 
follow the simplest of commands during her occupational therapy session, Meilen 
captured the moment. The hours of tape would eventually be cut to 35 minutes to 
be presented in court, but he said he thought that scene would stay. 
</P>
<P>
In response to criticism that such videos can be skewed with skillful editing, 
Meilen said: "We do try to select what we feel are the more poignant moments, 
but I am not creating anything other than what's there. We don't ask her to do 
anything different than she does in a normal day. We don't stage anything." 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about the potential for abuse of videos as evidence in trials are not 
new. They were voiced initially nearly 50 years ago, shortly after the 
California Supreme Court ruled that movies could be shown in court. The issue 
came to the court when Josephine Heiman appealed the use of the movie in her 
case against the Market Street Railway. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that there was no reason to bar moving pictures from being 
introduced as evidence in court, noting that movies are just a series of still 
photographs and that still photographs had long been accepted as admissible in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, however, a state appellate court warned judges that "moving 
pictures should be received as evidence with caution." 
</P>
<P>
"The modern art of photography and the devices of an ingenious director 
frequently produces results which may be quite deceiving. . . . Telescopic 
lenses, ingenious setting of the stage, the elimination of unfavorable portions 
of the film, the angle from which a picture is taken, and the genius of the 
director may tend to create misleading impressions," the decision stated. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent abuses, judges scrutinize the footage before the juries see it, to 
be sure a video does not misrepresent the events of the case in which it is 
introduced. If it does, a judge will rule the film inadmissible. 
</P>
<P>
Videos are also used, without controversy, to save time and money by recording 
the testimony of distant experts and witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
When hundreds of women across the country sued the manufacturer of the Dalkon 
Shield, A.H. Robbins, the videotape deposition of Howard Tuttle became a 
cornerstone of many of their cases. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle was the former staff attorney for the company, and in his deposition, he 
testified that he had been ordered to shred company documents showing that 
Robbins had early indications of the dangers of the shield. 
</P>
<P>
"Dalkon Shield cases were tried all over the U.S. The video was shown all over 
the place," said Jeff Holl, a San Francisco-based attorney who represented many 
women in their claims against the Robbins company. 
</P>
<P>
Among those Holl represented was an Encino woman who sued A.H. Robbins in Van 
Nuys Superior Court and eventually was awarded $165,000. Judge Thomas 
Schneider, who heard the case, said the Tuttle tape lasted several hours and 
was critical to proving that the Robbins company had been negligent. 
</P>
<P>
In the pre-video era, his testimony would have been read to jurors from a 
transcript of a deposition taken earlier. But judges say jurors are likely to 
pay more attention to a deposition on video and can better evaluate the 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
In a video, "you can see the person talking, and the impact is better," 
Schneider said. "If someone licks their lips, that might be a sign of 
nervousness that you would never pick up in a written deposition." 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1987, legislators, recognizing the advantages of such testimony, 
amended the California Code of Civil Procedure so lawyers no longer needed 
special permission to introduce videotape depositions. The code was also 
changed to allow videos of experts to be used, even if the expert witness is 
available to testify in person. 
</P>
<P>
But it is a judge in Sandusky, Ohio, who has realized the full potential of 
using videos to save time. Since 1971, more than 300 civil trials in the Erie 
County Court of Common Pleas -- the equivalent of California's Superior Court 
-- have been conducted completely on video. 
</P>
<P>
In these trials, all the evidence is prerecorded, then edited by the judge, who 
removes any inadmissible testimony and the questions that prompted that 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
After selecting a jury, the lawyers make their opening statements live, then 
jurors watch a videotape of the evidence while the judge retires to his 
chambers to edit the testimony for the next trial. 
</P>
<P>
Common Pleas Judge James McCrystal, who initiated the video trials, said they 
are one-third faster than trials with live witnesses. He also said they are 
fairer, because jurors do not hear evidence that is later ruled inadmissible. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't ignore what you have already heard. As the old saying goes, you 
can't unring a bell," McCrystal said. 
</P>
<P>
During a videotaped trial, jurors never have to sit around while attorneys 
argue in chambers with the judge about admissible evidence, and the jurors are 
not influenced by attorneys' outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
"We have polled more than 800 jurors. Most of them feel that they do a better 
job when the trial is on tape," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McCrystal hopes videotaped trials will become the norm in the future. He 
travels around the country promoting the idea, but he said many attorneys are 
reluctant to try it because they enjoy "performing live" in front of a jury. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of losing center stage scares them to death," he said.

NEW DECADE ECONOMIC VIEW OF S.D. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego's increasingly diversified economy kept humming right along in 1989, 
with job and economic growth outperforming that of both the state and nation. 
But pundits were uncertain at year's end how well the region would withstand 
the deep cuts in defense spending planned by the Bush Administration for coming 
years. 
</P>
<P>
During 1989, the San Diego region lost the headquarters of several publicly 
owned companies and financial institutions to mergers and acquisitions, lending 
substance to San Diego's image of being, essentially, a branch office town. 
Such an image would be reinforced if the proposed merger of San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric by SCEcorp, now midway through its second year of hearings and legal 
skirmishing, goes through. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism continued to flourish in 1989, with another bumper crop of visitors 
expected in 1990 with the new San Diego Convention Center heading into its 
first full year of trade shows and conventions. The center is expected to pull 
up to 14,000 additional visitors into San Diego each week, adding $250 million 
to 1990 visitor spending. 
</P>
<P>
And foreign manufacturers continued to flock to Baja California to set up 
maquiladoras, the in-bond plants where goods destined for the U.S. market are 
made with low cost Mexican labor. What was different in 1989 was that two heavy 
industrial manufacturers, Hyundai and Louisiana-Pacific, announced plans to set 
up operations in Tijuana and Ensenada, respectively. Heretofore, the 
overwhelming majority of maquiladoras have involved the assembly of components 
shipped in from foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego gross regional product, the sum of goods and services produced, 
grew by 4.6% in 1989, according to Wells Fargo Bank economist Joseph Wahed. 
That's down from the growth rates of the previous two years but still ahead of 
the state and U.S. overall. Jobs in San Diego County increased 3.7% to 1.1 
million over the year and the unemployment rate as of October was 3.8%, a full 
percentage point less than the state's. 
</P>
<P>
But the good times in San Diego over the past decade have been fueled in no 
small measure by the defense build-up sought by the Reagan Administration. And 
those dollars could drop off substantially if the Bush Administration carries 
out its aim to reduce defense spending by as much as $180 billion over a 
three-year period beginning in the 1991 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Direct defense expenditures in the county totaled $9.7 billion last year, or 
more than 20% of the county's gross regional product, and should come in at 
roughly the same amount in 1989, according to the Greater San Diego Chamber of 
Commerce's economic research department. Since 1975, defense spending has risen 
here nearly fivefold from $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Local economists generally view the San Diego economy as being diversified 
enough now to avoid the devastation that defense spending cuts wrought in the 
early 1960s. Still, any significant spending cut will be felt in a county that 
is home to 144,000 uniformed service men and women, 34,000 civilian employees 
and an estimated 72,000 workers directly involved in defense contracts. 
</P>
<P>
There was a rash of acquisitions of locally based public companies and banks by 
outsiders during the year, including Gen-Probe (acquired by Chugai 
Pharmaceutical), Monitor Technologies (Lear Siegler Measurement Controls), 
Pancretec (Abbott Laboratories), Smith Laboratories (proposed merger with 
Columbia Hospital Corp.), Torrey Pines Bank (Wells Fargo), La Jolla Bank &amp; 
Trust and Southwest Bank (both by Security Pacific Corp.) 
</P>
<P>
Western Health Plans, parent of Greater San Diego Health Plan, filed for 
bankruptcy and sold its membership to a group of local hospitals. Both Syntro 
and Henley Group moved their headquarters away from San Diego and Cipher Data 
Products, which last month received an unsolicited takeover bid from Archive 
Corp. of Costa Mesa, could be on the verge of disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
The local business community was startled by the arrest of Yuba Natural 
Resources Chairman Richard Silberman in April in connection with attempted 
money laundering, one of a host of problems that the San Diego-based gold 
mining company faced. Silberman is the husband of county supervisor Susan 
Golding, a former partner of Jack in the Box fast food chain founder Robert O. 
Peterson and a former state cabinet secretary under California Governor Jerry 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
The three major savings and loans headquartered in San Diego -- HomeFed Bank, 
Great American Bank and Imperial Savings -- each faced problems of varying 
degrees of seriousness in 1989 as did many other U.S. thrifts. All were 
knuckling under tough new capital standards imposed by the federal S&amp;L 
rescue bill passed over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Savings President Kenneth Thygerson, who resigned in July, saw the 
defeat of his "nontraditional" approach to S&amp;L management when ICA's junk 
bond portfolio of investments lost more than $200 million in market value, 
resulting in write-downs that left the S&amp;L with a negative net worth at 
year's end and vulnerable to a federal takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Great American continued to wrestle with its troubled Arizona loan portfolio 
which so far has caused the S&amp;L to take more than $100 million in loan loss 
reserves. Even HomeFed, the strongest of the three local thrifts, saw its stock 
price drop precipitously on reports of problems with its real estate loans. 
</P>
<P>
A bright light in the local economic firmament was tourism. Visitor spending 
for the first 10 months of 1989 was up 5% over the previous year to $2.6 
billion. Total visitors were up 1.6% and hotel room nights sold rose 2.8%. The 
San Diego Convention Center which opened in late November but which will host 
its first full fledged convention this month, should bump those tourism 
increases up to even higher levels in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World of San Diego, one of the area's top tourist draws, was sold by parent 
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, along with five other theme parks, to Anheuser-Busch 
for $1.1 billion. The sale was necessitated by the need to pay down debt 
incurred by HBJ's costly restructuring in 1987.

HOTELS READY AND WAITING FOR CONVENTION CENTER TO FILL THEIR REGISTERS; 
</P>
<P>
TOURISM: DELAYS IN THE CENTER'S CONSTRUCTION LEFT SAN DIEGO WITH A HOTEL ROOM 
GLUT, BUT OWNERS ARE HOPEFUL THAT 1990 WILL BE A DIFFERENT STORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In June, 1985, hotel consultants Laventhol &amp; Horwath told developers in a 
report that if they didn't "get cracking" to build hotels in downtown San 
Diego, there would be a serious shortage of rooms by the time the San Diego 
Convention Center, then in its planning stages, opened its doors. 
</P>
<P>
Smelling the potential for profit, hoteliers heeded the call and began breaking 
ground on dozens of hotels countywide, eventually adding some 11,000 rooms to 
the county's supply over the next four years, a construction boom unequaled in 
the United States except in Las Vegas and Orlando, Fla., said Al Reese, 
spokesman for the San Diego Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the consultants nor the developers could know that the Convention 
Center's opening would be plagued by two years of delays. Now, a few days 
before the center stages its first large-scale convention, San Diego finds 
itself in the midst of a hotel room glut that has given travelers more choice 
and better rates, but has made it more difficult for hotels to fill their rooms 
with guests. 
</P>
<P>
"When you add 11,000 rooms to any area, obviously the pie gets sliced a little 
thinner," said Larry Saward, general manager of the Sheraton Grand on Harbor 
Island. "With more rooms, the competition is keener, and that contributes, to 
some extent, to lower occupancy rates." 
</P>
<P>
Total hotel rooms in the county now number more than 40,000, a 50% increase 
since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Although the county's average occupancy rate of 69.6% from January through 
October of last year is better than the national average of 68.4%, the figure 
represents a significant drop from previous years. In fact, the county's 
year-to-date occupancy rate has dropped 3.6% from the comparable 1988 period, 
and is at its lowest level since at least 1983, according to statistics 
compiled by Laventhol &amp; Horwath. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in occupancy occurred despite a 1.6% increase in overnight visitors 
to the San Diego area during the same period and a 2.8% rise in total hotel 
room nights sold. That the occupancy rate softened despite increased visitor 
traffic shows that hotel room supply is outpacing demand. 
</P>
<P>
But the glut may be short-lived, or so hotel owners hope. The San Diego 
Convention Center, which hosted its first consumer show in November and will 
stage its first full-fledged convention Wednesday through Saturday, is expected 
to generate 242,000 additional hotel room night sales in 1990, a 2.4% increase 
in demand by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
The center so far has booked 32 conventions and trade shows for 1990, ranging 
in size from 3,000 to 15,000 visitors per show, including such groups as the 
National Spa &amp; Pool Institute, the National Needlework Assn. and the Assn. 
of Secondary School Principals, Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
Through much of 1989, the oversupply of hotel rooms was quite beneficial to San 
Diego hotel guests. Overall, average room rates countywide for the first nine 
months of 1989 hardly budged from the previous year, increasing just 2 cents, 
to $78.35 per night, a rate of increase that didn't begin to keep pace with 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Average room prices were up only slightly in downtown, and bay-area hotels and 
hotels in Old Town on average had to cut prices by 3.4%, according to 
statistics compiled by the Pannell Kerr Forster accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
From a hotel owner's point of view, however, the addition of so many hotel 
rooms to the market before the city was able to generate enough demand had a 
devastating effect. Especially hard hit were those that lacked the meeting 
space needed to host large groups of visitors and that were depending on the 
Convention Center to fill its rooms with guests. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating the Convention Center opening, originally set for 1987, developers 
began to build and restore a number of hotels in the 1980s, including the U.S. 
Grant, the Omni San Diego, the San Diego Marriott and the Horton Grand. 
</P>
<P>
But Convention Center construction soon fell behind schedule. Excavation of the 
waterfront site where the center would eventually stand took months longer than 
expected. Then, after the initial bids came in millions of dollars over budget, 
port officials reluctantly agreed to a rebid, which set back the construction 
date a full year. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Marriott, which timed the opening date of its second tower to 
coincide with the opening of the Convention Center, had no choice but to press 
forward with its construction plans, even if it meant opening nearly two years 
before the Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Hotel development is not something you can turn on and off like a faucet," 
said Laventhol &amp; Horwath principal Greg Peerbolte. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the Marriott suffered little from the delay in the Convention 
Center's completion. With more than 1,300 rooms, the Marriott has been able to 
stay in the black by hosting smaller business conventions and meetings, general 
manager Joel Rothman said. 
</P>
<P>
But for many other hotels, the delay wrought serious financial damage. Two 
years ago, the U.S. Grant filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal 
Bankruptcy Code, finally pulling out of its financial troubles last April. By 
that time, the Omni San Diego had also gone bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
"It's common knowledge downtown that hotels were built, and this one restored, 
on the understanding that the Convention Center would be completed earlier," 
said U.S. Grant spokesman David Rushton. "The occupancy levels were not as high 
as anyone anticipated." 
</P>
<P>
Even with 32 trade shows and conventions scheduled for this year, officials 
predict it could be at least a year before the center begins operating at a 
pace that would satisfy the local hotel industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I would venture to guess that within another couple of years, there might be 
another wave of hotels being booked," said Paul Desrochers, assistant vice 
president of the Centre City Development Corp. "It appears we could still 
support a couple more hotels in a couple years -- and I'm being conservative." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Guthrie, director of sales and marketing for the Westgate Hotel in 
downtown San Diego, agreed: "I think a lot of us are glad 1989 is over. We had 
a lot of premature growth this last year, with a lot of rooms opening up before 
the Convention Center. But the downtown hotels will be immediately affected by 
the Convention Center opening, and certainly we're optimistic we'll have a much 
better year because of it." 
</P>
<P>
Reese, of the Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau, however, was more cautious 
about the immediate effect the Convention Center. His agency faces "a very 
serious challenge" trying to market San Diego to get the hotel rooms filled, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to do our best to bring it (the decline in occupancy rates) to an 
end, but, looking at the number of new hotel rooms that are scheduled to come 
on line here in the next few years, it is quite likely that it will continue." 
</P>
<P>
Estimates on the number of new hotel rooms expected to be added to the county's 
inventory next year range up to 2,250 new rooms, a 5.6% increase from the year 
before. Hotels expected to open this year include the Symphony Towers Marriott 
and the Pan Pacific Hotel, both downtown, the Radisson Inn in National City and 
the Carlsbad Village Hotel in North County. 
</P>
<P>
About half the new rooms will be located in downtown San Diego, with the 
majority of the rest in North County.

CIRCUIT CITY HAS BOOMED TO AN ELECTRONICS METROPOLIS 
</P>

People who like to stay home evenings, pop a frozen dinner in the microwave and 
watch a rented video have made Richard L. Sharp a happy man. 
</P>
<P>
"That's clearly one of the trends which has contributed to the popularity of 
the VCR and microwave," said Sharp, president and chief executive officer of 
Circuit City Stores Inc., which has ridden to phenomenal success the boom in 
the two consumer products over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp has seen his business grow from a small seller of consumer electronic 
items, with half its operations in other company's stores, to one of the 
nation's largest retailers of brand-name electronics and appliances. 
</P>
<P>
Circuit City operates in 53 U.S. markets, most of which have one or more of the 
company's huge Superstores displaying a vast array of wares. In 1989, the chain 
entered the local market as it opened stores in San Diego and National City. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the growth in operations and sales has come impressive stock gains. 
</P>
<P>
Circuit City's shares, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, increased 
more than 8,100% during the 1980s, from an adjusted-for-splits price of 26 
cents a share at the beginning of the decade to $21.75 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The gains made Circuit City one of the top 20 stock winners of the '80s. The 
company has 125 Superstores, usually 32,000-square-foot operations that feature 
rows and rows of stereos, televisions, freezers, refrigerators and other 
products. Roaming through the displays are aggressive sales personnel -- a 
large portion of the company's 15,000-member work force -- seeking out buyers 
for the low-priced goods. 
</P>
<P>
Circuit City still has 20 smaller stores, but Ann Collier, financial relations 
manager for the company, said those outlets eventually will be replaced with 
Superstores. 
</P>
<P>
The Richmond-based company's operations stretch along the Eastern Seaboard from 
Pennsylvania to Florida, and are in three Western states: California, Nevada 
and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the decade, almost half of Circuit City's 70 selling units, 
which then carried electronics but not appliances, were departments operating 
inside other stores, Collier said. 
</P>
<P>
But then the company repositioned itself to cash in on the popularity of VCRs 
and microwaves with its megastores. It also got out of New York City, where 
real estate prices prohibited the Superstore format, "to focus our resources in 
the areas of greatest opportunity," Collier said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, she said, 23% of the company's sales come from VCRs and video cameras, 
providing a nice balance to the 24% that comes from TV sales, 22% from audio 
equipment and 20% from appliances. Sales of other electronic items make up the 
remaining 11%. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp, Circuit City's chief since 1986, pushed the company into five new 
markets in 1989, including its first stores in Philadelphia and Phoenix. He 
also replaced two regular stores with Superstores in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of its fiscal year, which ended Nov. 30, the 
company's sales reached $1.4 billion, a 21% increase over the same period a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Saut, director of research at the Richmond investment firm Branch, Cabell 
&amp; Co., was wary about recommending Circuit City stock. 
</P>
<P>
"If the economy is going to have a soft landing, it's a buy," he said, 
referring to the gentle reduction in economic activity than is the goal of the 
Federal Reserve Board. "If it's a hard landing, then it's questionable." 
</P>
<P>
Saut said the company's appliance sales are showing some weakness but that the 
electronics are still doing well. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp acknowledges that it's easier to grow faster when sales are $100 million 
a year instead of approaching $2 billion.

SABAN SEEKS OLDER TV AUDIENCE; 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAMS: THE FOUNDER OF SABAN ENTERTAINMENT, WHICH PRODUCES CHILDREN'S SHOWS, 
TAKES THE LEAP TO PRIME TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Haim Saban can hardly sit still when he talks. The founder, chairman and chief 
executive of Burbank-based Saban Entertainment twitches nervously in his chair, 
cracks a joke, then jumps up and scurries across the room without explanation. 
</P>
<P>
But all this energy doesn't go unused. The 45-year-old Israeli native works 
16-hour days, seven days a week, trying to build his company into a diversified 
entertainment concern. 
</P>
<P>
Since he founded Saban Entertainment in 1980, Saban has primarily produced 
musical scores for children's programming, as well as producing children's TV 
shows. His programs include "Kidd Video," an MTV-like show that ran for two 
years on NBC, "ALF Tales," an animated fairy-tale adventure series currently on 
NBC, and "Camp Candy," an animated NBC series featuring the voice of actor John 
Candy. 
</P>
<P>
But Saban has bigger plans and is setting his sights on prime time. His company 
is producing six miniseries and TV movies, including "Phantom of the Opera," a 
miniseries starring Burt Lancaster and Charles Dance that will appear on NBC in 
the spring. The company is also producing its first late-night show, a 
comedy/variety series called "Offshore TV," hosted by the Hudson Brothers, 
which it plans to sell in first-run syndication. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens in this city is people specialize in areas," Saban said. "We 
don't want to be put in any niche. We're in kids, we're in first-run 
syndication, we're in prime time, we're in late night, and we intend to stay 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
Some industry veterans say the jump from daytime to prime time won't be easy. 
"You're dealing with a completely different type of audience," said Larry 
Friedericks, executive vice president of Fries International, a subsidiary of 
the television production company Fries Entertainment. "Having a cute little 
dog arfing is different than having dramatic actresses and actors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But prime-time shows can be far more lucrative than daytime children's shows, 
and Saban said he wants to be as diversified as possible. "Being in all those 
businesses allows us to hedge our bets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Saban moved to the United States in 1980, after a career as a record 
producer in France, his company has grown steadily, and in the past couple of 
years he's hired executives to help manage and maintain that growth. In August, 
he brought on Tom Palmieri, who quit his executive post at MTM Enterprises 
("The Bob Newhart Show," "St. Elsewhere," "Hill Street Blues"). Palmieri is now 
Saban's president. In 1988 Saban also hired Stan Golden from Horizon 
International TV to head Saban's international distribution arm. 
</P>
<P>
Palmieri said he moved to Saban because the company "reminded me of the way MTM 
was when I joined them nine years ago -- in the early stages, with a high 
energy level and a lot of things going on." 
</P>
<P>
In all, Saban produces or co-produces about 16 children's shows currently 
running on network, cable TV or in syndication. Palmieri said the company has 
grown fivefold since 1986 and will log "well in excess of $50 million" in 
revenues in 1989, although he declined to break down those figures. Since 
February, Palmieri said, Saban has funded more than $35 million in program 
production, and "everything is done out of our own working capital. We are 
completely debt free." 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, one of Saban's most lucrative assets is its 1,050-title library 
of prime-time and children's programming, which includes Saban's own 
productions and rights it acquired to other programming by foreign and domestic 
companies. The library includes series such as "Unsolved Mysteries," the 
docudrama based on real-life crimes, as well as various animated children's 
series, such as foreign-made versions of "Pinocchio" and "Peter Pan." 
</P>
<P>
The company distributes the titles in foreign markets such as Britain, Germany, 
France, Switzerland and Australia. Many of these countries have a strong demand 
for American-made entertainment because of the deregulation of television and 
the growth of satellite and cable. 
</P>
<P>
To keep the momentum, Saban recently teamed with Edgar Scherick, a veteran film 
and TV producer who was the head of programming at ABC-TV during the 1960s. 
Saban/Scherick Productions, a division of Saban Entertainment, will focus on 
miniseries and made-for-TV movies. Scherick was a producer of feature films 
such as "Sleuth" and "The Heartbreak Kid," and, more recently, TV movies and 
miniseries such as "Little Gloria . . . Happy at Last," and "The Kennedys of 
Massachusetts." 
</P>
<P>
Saban/Scherick's first efforts are the "Phantom of the Opera" miniseries, and 
"The Secret Life of Ian Fleming," a movie that will appear on the TNT cable 
network early this year. 
</P>
<P>
Industry veterans say the partnership with Scherick will help give Saban 
credibility when dealing with the networks. "It's a smart play," said TV 
producer Leonard ("Rags to Riches") Hill. But he warned that luring Scherick 
was only "a first tentative step" for Saban, and that the company will need to 
establish a stable of successful producers in order to become a major 
competitive force. "The only prime-time, creative, credible entity within Saban 
is Edgar Scherick," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Saban got into show business when he started managing bands in Israel at the 
age of 22. He was a well-known music promoter by age 25. But when the 1973 Yom 
Kippur War broke out, Saban lost nearly all his money. 
</P>
<P>
Starting over in France with his partner, composer Shuki Levy, Saban soon 
became a successful record producer. Saban Record's first release, by a 
9-year-old Israeli boy, Noam Kaniel, went platinum with sales of 2 million 
copies. Within seven years, the company had 15 gold and platinum records. 
Meanwhile, Saban Records began creating sound tracks for French TV shows and 
for the European versions of American shows such as "Dallas" and "Hart to 
Hart." 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Saban decided to move to the United States, and after spending 
$150,000 to build a recording studio here, he began targeting the market for TV 
sound tracks. By 1983 his company had formed an association with Burbank-based 
DIC Enterprises, a leading producer of animated children's programs. Saban 
produced original sound tracks to DIC shows such as "Inspector Gadget." In 
1985, Saban launched into program production by co-producing with DIC "Kidd 
Video," a show for children that mixed animation with live action in an 
MTV-like format. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Tucker Vinson, vice president of children's programming for NBC, 
recalled meeting Saban in the early 1980s and being impressed with his new 
ideas. "We had been looking for a way to update Saturday morning music," said 
Vinson. Saban "offered to do some demos for us. He came up quickly with a theme 
we liked. It was more contemporary and hip, and we thought kids were listening 
to hip music on radio and then tuning into TV and hearing babyish sounds." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Saban continues to run the business end of things, while his original 
partner, Levy -- who is married to actress Deborah Shelton of "Dallas" fame -- 
continues to write music. 
</P>
<P>
Saban said he hopes to expand the company through acquisitions. He is also 
"dabbling" with a new record label and has signed his first artist, actor and 
musician Gary ("The Buddy Holly Story") Busey.

VALLEY EARNINGS: SFE TECHNOLOGIES LOSSES GROW IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SFE Technologies, a San Fernando electronics firm, reported its losses widened 
to $8.8 million in the fiscal fourth quarter that ended Oct. 28 from a 
$3-million loss a year earlier. Revenues fell 20% to $7 million from $8.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The loss in the latest period included a $7-million charge to provide for a 
writedown for excess and obsolete inventory. SFE Chairman William Kuehn, who 
joined the company in November, said SFE is repositioning itself from mass 
markets for electronic components to manufacturing more specialized electronic 
components for use by the military and private industry. 
</P>
<P>
For the year that ended Oct. 28, SFE said it lost $9.7 million, compared to a 
$4.3-million loss in fiscal 1988. Revenues were $30.4 million, down 16% from 
$36.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Kuehn said SFE's West-Cap Arizona subsidiary negotiated a plea 
agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. West-Cap agreed to plead guilty 
to two counts involving violations of quality control testing and reporting 
procedures for electronic components West-Cap manufactured for the military. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum penalty West-Cap faces is a $10,000 fine per count, which may be 
increased to $50,000, plus restitution, Kuehn said. He expects the West-Cap 
matter to be resolved by June.

THOMAS BROS. BEGINS COMPUTER MAPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
Thomas Bros., the venerable map maker that has helped guide generations of 
Southern California drivers, entered the high-tech era last month with the 
release of its first book of fully computer-generated maps. 
</P>
<P>
The new guide for Sacramento is the first product of a three-year effort by 
Thomas Bros. to develop a system for electronically storing and updating the 
millions of pieces of information that go into a street map. 
</P>
<P>
The first Los Angeles and Orange counties guide to use the new system will be 
published in about a year. Warren Wilson, president and chief executive officer 
of Thomas Bros., said the company hopes to have all of its 24 map books 
computerized within two years. 
</P>
<P>
The Sacramento guide features a new, brighter cover, and is slightly larger 
than the traditional guide. 
</P>
<P>
The map pages have a cleaner look, with more color and better graphics, and the 
text is larger and easier to read. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said Sacramento is serving as a trial site because it has the right mix 
of characteristics and is not an important market for the company, which serves 
every county in California and several other areas in Western states. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Bros.' digital mapping system converts geographical information from 
aerial photographs into millions of bits of information that can be stored and 
manipulated by a computer. Once the basic data is in the system, it can be 
augmented or amended easily with a few keystrokes. 
</P>
<P>
Even more important, having a computer database of map information will enable 
Thomas Bros. to generate special-purpose maps and other information that might 
be useful to businesses, government agencies, universities or individuals. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Wilson said the company would be using data collected in the 
1990 census and combining it with its map information to produce maps showing 
the demographic characteristics of areas. 
</P>
<P>
The company has set up a new subsidiary, called Thomas Bros. Information 
Systems, to develop and market specialized products derived from the master 
database. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be moving into these ancillary product areas, as well as publishing 
traditional guides," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Thomas Bros. has invested $3 million to $4 million thus far in 
developing the digital mapping system. 
</P>
<P>
One of Thomas Bros.' biggest concerns in launching the new guides is that they 
will use a new page and grid system that will not correspond to the old system. 
For customers who count on the Thomas Bros. reference points to find a 
location, the guide provides a conversion chart, and the company has 
established a toll-free phone number to respond to any questions.

The American auto industry underwent more wrenching change in the 1980s than in 
any era since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The decade began with an energy crunch and an economic slump that left 
Detroit's Big Three reeling. 
</P>
<P>
It is ending with the Big Three slipping once more into recession and their 
Japanese rivals still setting the pace in the car market. Despite a 
multibillion-dollar drive by the domestic industry to catch up, Detroit never 
has been able to match Japanese car makers on quality. 
</P>
<P>
And car buyers are increasingly turning their backs on the domestics. In 1980, 
Japanese manufacturers held 19.7% of the American car market; today, they have 
24.66%, a figure held back by import quotas imposed in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Japanese are leapfrogging Detroit to compete head-on with European 
firms in the luxury market, and, as a result, sales of pricey West German and 
British cars are starting to slide. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japanese car makers have moved much of their production to the 
United States in order to skirt trade restraints. They now have eight assembly 
plants in this country and soon will have the capacity to build 2 million cars 
and trucks a year here -- roughly the same as Chrysler's North American 
production. 
</P>
<P>
To compete, Detroit has been forced to form a complex web of joint ventures 
with Japanese and European companies. Ford, for instance, now counts on Mazda 
of Japan for its subcompact development, Kia of Korea to assemble its smallest 
cars and Ford of Europe to develop its mid-size cars. Meanwhile, it has just 
purchased Jaguar to compete with the German luxury car builders. 
</P>
<P>
As the 1990s begin, import restraints remain in place on Japanese cars but now 
seem irrelevant because of Japan's U.S. production facilities. The major 
Japanese auto makers are not even filling their quota allocations from Japan 
because they are selling so many American-built cars. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 1990s, look for Japanese car makers to take on an increasingly 
American look. JAMES RISEN

The defense industry's thrill ride up the Reagan Administration military 
spending boom is quickly changing into one of the scariest plunges in the 
industry's long history, threatening a major consolidation in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s opened with a national consensus to rebuild America's military 
forces, a goal that led to a doubling of defense acquisition and the awarding 
of major weapons programs to virtually every prime contractor in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
But a series of national scandals involving criminal fraud in the industry, 
overpriced spare parts and faulty weapons systems led to a congressional 
backlash. Regulations exploded, profit margins were squeezed and financing 
terms became penurious, forcing major increases in debt loads. 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, the Reagan spending boom encouraged the industry to add industrial 
capacity at a time when most experts agreed that there was already excess 
capacity. Another Pentagon policy of fostering competition failed to cut costs, 
but profits suffered. 
</P>
<P>
By 1985, the great boom had already peaked and leveled out, though the long 
pipeline of funding from Washington continued to allow many contractors to grow 
for several years. 
</P>
<P>
Although the thawing of the Cold War has just begun, it already seems likely 
that the nation's 2.2-million-member armed forces will be reduced -- and the 
arms industry along with it. Annual spending on defense has already been 
declining at 2% after inflation for several years, and political pressure is 
building to accelerate that decline. 
</P>
<P>
Excess capacity will have to be reduced; some companies will leave the defense 
industry permanently, and contractors will be thinned out further by mergers 
among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
But the aerospace industry has a bright future in commercial aircraft, in which 
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas have backlogs that will extend production into the 
next century. And the civilian space program is growing rapidly once again.

For Hollywood, the opening act of the 1980s was sheer warfare. The major 
studios battled outsiders who sought to distribute movies through new 
technologies such as cable networks and home videocassettes. MCA Inc. and Walt 
Disney Co. fought Sony Corp.'s importation of video players all the way to the 
U.S. Supreme Court, and MCA and several other studios tried to foil Time Inc.'s 
Home Box Office by launching their own pay-cable service. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood lost both battles, but it pocketed awesome sums of money from the 
licensing of its movies to the new players. Now, video and cable sales generate 
about 57% of Hollywood's revenue -- compared to about 30% earned at the box 
office, according to Paul Kagan Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Being pragmatic, the major studios have been merging with one-time enemies. The 
common quest: to control not only the programming but strategic portions of the 
distribution "pipeline." 
</P>
<P>
In the past year alone, Warner Communications Inc. combined with Time Inc., and 
Columbia Pictures Entertainment agreed to an acquisition by Sony. Three years 
earlier, 20th Century Fox Film Corp. joined the global empire of Rupert 
Murdoch, who spent more than $2 billion to buy the studio and seven TV stations 
and is now building a satellite-delivery TV service in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The entertainment industry will be dominated in the 1990s by such media giants, 
according to some analysts, who add Tele-Communications Inc., Disney and 
Capital Cities/ABC to the list. (Indeed, control of all three TV networks 
changed hands in the '80s, with only CBS not now owned by a huge conglomerate.) 
</P>
<P>
The decade had its subplots, of course -- and some befit the propaganda films 
of the 1940s. Little was said when Australians bid for Hollywood studios, but 
the arrival of Japanese buyers has touched a nationalistic nerve. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Isgur, Paine Webber's veteran entertainment industry analyst, predicts that 
the power of American film making will speed Japanese assimilation into Western 
culture, rather than the other way around. "The joke," said Isgur, "is did we 
buy Japan, or did they buy Columbia Pictures?" KATHRYN HARRIS

The oil business started the 1980s with gas lines, stalled with a worldwide oil 
price collapse, accelerated with a wave of megamergers, stalled again when the 
Exxon Valdez ran aground and is now creeping cautiously into the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, the nation's demand for energy will confront environmental 
worries in the wake of the Valdez incident, drilling bans, clean-air laws and 
concerns about global warming, the so-called greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices that fell in 1986 to about $9 should hold at the current $19 or $20 
a barrel at least through the early part of the decade. Such prices would help 
the recovery of an industry still reeling from a decade of restructuring, 
downsizing and streamlining. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990s could see a modest resurgence of alternative sources of energy -- 
perhaps even a smaller, safer nuclear industry. But most analysts expect 
continued reliance on oil. 
</P>
<P>
New technology should lead to more efficient energy use and improve production 
from existing U.S. wells. Currently off-limits areas such as the Arctic 
National Wildlife Refuge and coastal areas could eventually be opened to 
exploration. 
</P>
<P>
But few analysts expect U.S. oil production to turn up again, and the U.S. oil 
industry will become more international, with most exploration and production 
taking place overseas -- especially in Pacific Rim areas. 
</P>
<P>
The big question will be when oil companies can expect the already overdue 
collapse of the so-called natural gas bubble, or oversupply. New clean-air 
regulations should increase demand for cleaner-burning gas, which is also used 
to make methanol and other alternative fuels. That would lead to higher prices 
-- and that would be good news for U.S. companies with sizable reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Because U.S. oil and gas production fell in the 1980s, imports increased, and 
that has set the stage for a re-emergence of the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries as a world force -- if it can keep quotas in line. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, national oil companies of countries such as Kuwait, Venezuela and 
Saudi Arabia will dominate the worldwide industry, analysts say. Those 
companies will continue moving into the refining and marketing end of the 
business in the United States and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
As the 1980s showed, developments in the oil business can come swiftly and 
unexpectedly, and analysts are not ruling out price shocks or shortages later 
in the decade. PATRICK LEE

POLITICAL CHANGES BOLSTER STOCK INVESTMENTS ABROAD; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETS: EXCHANGES IN JAPAN AND EUROPE POSTED DOUBLE-DIGIT GAINS IN 1989. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The planned 1992 unification of Europe and the opening of the Eastern Bloc 
created the prospect of economic opportunities that propelled major foreign 
stock markets to double-digit gains in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Investors worldwide scrambled to put money on the Continent. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. investors pumped money into mutual funds that invest in Europe, and the 
Japanese set up their own stock funds invested specifically in West German 
companies, seen as the most immediate beneficiaries of the Iron Curtain's 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two months, foreign appetite for German stocks has helped boost the 
Frankfurt market to an annual net gain of 35%. 
</P>
<P>
But Germany's market performance was not an isolated one. Key stock indexes in 
London and Milan also rose impressively, as did the world's largest stock 
market, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's stock market seemed to be on a record-setting spree throughout the 
year. The 225-issue Nikkei stock index opened the year at a record high of 
30,243.66; it finished the year Friday at 38,915.87, the fourth-consecutive day 
of record closings and a 29% gain over 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Tokyo said the market overcame a number of obstacles this year, 
including the death of Emperor Hirohito in January, political instability, 
currency fluctuations and fear of creeping inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The market's strength was underscored in October when the Nikkei failed to 
follow Wall Street's precipitous Oct. 13 drop, when the Dow Jones industrial 
index fell 7.1% in value. 
</P>
<P>
The key British stock index fell 3.2%, and the Frankfurt market lost 13.2% in 
response to Wall Street's drop, but Tokyo shares declined only 1.8% before 
rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the mini-crash, "the biggest event of the year is the opening up of 
Eastern Europe," said Robert Rolland, executive vice president at Shearson 
Lehman Hutton Inc., in New York. "That's definitely the theme going into the 
'90s, and it obviously overshadows any one-day drop in the stock market." 
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the FAZ 100-share index rose 35% to finish the year at 740.90, up 
from 549.86 at the start of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Rolland characterized the recent buying of German stocks and stock funds -- 
particularly by the Japanese -- as "almost a frenzy." Because German stocks 
typically are not split, their prices can become prohibitively expensive. 
Deutsche Bank, for example, is trading in the $490-a-share range. 
</P>
<P>
But the Germany Fund, a closed-end mutual fund that trades on the New York 
Stock Exchange, can be had for $19 a share, Rolland said. About a year ago the 
Germany Fund sold for $6.625 a share. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished the year 
at 2,422.7, up from 1,793.1 at the beginning of 1989. Investors were attracted 
to British companies because they have issued little debt in comparison to 
their American counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
But volume was disappointing, prompting investment firms to cut costs through 
layoffs and other measures. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Europe, takeover fever gripped France in 1989 and helped push the 
CAC-40 index up 27% on the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only was it takeovers driving the market, but the possibility of takeovers 
. . . ahead of 1992," when Europe will meld into a single, barrier-free market, 
Rolland said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the larger deals, the bank holding company Cie. Financiere de Suez took 
over Cie. Industrielle and its insurance subsidiary Groupe Victoire for about 
$4.1 billion after a brief but bitter fight. 
</P>
<P>
In Italy, the key BCI index rose 17%, to 687.44 on Friday from 589.72. Italy 
also is positioning itself for 1992, but the country's overwhelming debt -- 
which roughly equals its gross national product -- has created drag on the 
stock market, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a perception of negativity" in Italy, said Guy Stern, an analyst at 
ABD Securities Corp. in New York. "They have to re-evaluate their national 
strategy and how they will expand." 
</P>
<P>
The Italian market began to rally in late May when giant Fiat announced a major 
share buyback program, but it stumbled later over an Italian bank's 
unauthorized loans to the Iraqi government. The country was dealt a further 
blow when Fiat failed to strike a deal with the Swedish auto maker Saab, which 
instead allied itself with General Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The unheralded growth market was Spain. It is not yet attracting much foreign 
capital, and the Madrid General Index rose just 8% this year. But Stern noted 
that, except for Portugal, Spain has the fastest growing gross domestic product 
of any European country.

The 1990s will realize some of Wall Street's brightest hopes and darkest fears. 
</P>
<P>
The decade will bring a much closer integration of world capital markets, a 
development that will sharply increase demand for brokerage and underwriting 
services. But with the new integration will come booming competition from 
abroad and home, shaving profits in some areas razor thin. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street firms were preparing for this new reality in the 1980s. Many sought 
to bolster their financial resources by merging or forming alliances with 
wealthy outsiders. Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. was purchased by General Electric, 
for example, while Paine Webber sold an 18% stake to Yasuda Mutual Life 
Insurance, and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. sold a 12.5% stake to Sumitomo Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The need for capital was partly due to the threat of increased competition from 
commercial banks, which were barred from the securities business for half a 
century by the Glass-Steagall Act. With deregulation, the act has been slowly 
unwound. And the one remaining barrier -- which prevents commercial banks from 
underwriting stock issues -- eventually may be swept away as well. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the tough new competitive climate, analysts expect Wall Street's big 
full-service firms to be forced to become much more nimble in the 1990s, 
jumping quickly into new ventures and out of them just as quickly if they don't 
pay off. This means that the big firms' payrolls will rise and fall swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
Merger advice, which has provided up to 40% of some big investment banks' 
earnings in this decade, will probably earn them less over the next several 
years if a recession materializes. Further out, however, integration of the 
world economy will set off a new round of corporate mergers. There may also be 
big moneymaking opportunities as the U.S. firms that have taken on so much debt 
in the 1990s issue new stock, sell assets or take other steps to strengthen 
their financial positions. 
</P>
<P>
For the regional stock brokerages that sell investments to individuals, life in 
the 1990s may change much less. Their best customers, Americans over 50 years 
old, will grow sharply in number and will still be willing to pay well for 
financial services. PAUL RICHTER

CENSUS DATA ASSISTS BUSINESS WHERE IT COUNTS: ACCURATE DEMOGRAPHICS; 
</P>
<P>
RESEARCH: THE NATIONWIDE COUNT YIELDS UNEQUALED DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION FOR 
MARKETING STRATEGISTS.

<P>
When Southern California residents fill out their 1990 census forms this 
spring, most will assume that they're participating in more than just another 
marketing survey. The census, after all, is carried out by the federal 
government under a constitutional mandate, and its avowed purpose is to count 
the population so that political representation and government funds can be 
properly distributed. 
</P>
<P>
But the census also serves as a comprehensive study of American consumers, 
producing reams of information on the income and life styles of people who live 
in a certain county or on a particular city block. It's the kind of demographic 
information that makes marketing strategists drool, and no other data source 
can touch the census in terms of its scope and accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
It's no surprise, then, that census information is sold and resold and 
reshuffled for an incredible array of business purposes. "Virtually every 
business uses census data," said Mark Baldassare, a professor of social ecology 
at the University of California, Irvine who uses the census extensively 
himself. "It's omnipresent." 
</P>
<P>
Retailers use census information in deciding where to locate new stores. Banks 
use it in determining how to market certificates of deposit. Health-care 
companies use it to plan new services. Maura Eggan, marketing director for 
South Coast Plaza, puts it simply, "The census shows where our customers are, 
and in what numbers." 
</P>
<P>
The basic census questionnaire -- which will be sent to every home in the 
country by April 1 -- simply records the number of people in a household, their 
ages, sex, marital status, race and the type of housing in which they reside. 
That's useful information for any marketing department. 
</P>
<P>
But even more mouthwatering is the information that comes from the so-called 
long form, or sample form -- sent to one out of every six households, which 
involves 45 additional questions that elicit detailed information on household 
income, mortgage payments, commuting patterns, energy usage and many other 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
The volume of information collected in the census is so staggering, however, 
that making good use of it can be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau, which spends $2.6 billion collecting the information, does 
not slice and dice the data to fit every possible use, and not many businesses 
have the computer equipment or manpower to crunch the numbers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The basic data set has another liability: With 10 years between censuses, it 
gets old. And it takes the Census Bureau so long to compile everything -- the 
basic 1990 "head count" should be ready by year-end, but much of the more 
detailed data will not be available until 1993 -- that some of the information 
is old even before it's published. 
</P>
<P>
Solving these two problems is how the raft of independent information vendors 
make their livings. Companies such as Donnelley Marketing Information Services, 
National Planning Data Corp., Urban Decision Systems Inc. and National Decision 
Systems function as what Jeri Denniston, marketing manager at National 
Decisions Systems in Encinitas, calls "value-added resellers of census data." 
</P>
<P>
For a price, these firms will provide demographic data for any population area. 
Thinking of a new store at a certain intersection? A profile of the population 
within a 2-mile radius of that intersection -- or a 20-mile radius, or a 
200-mile radius -- is just a phone call away. "We repackage, reformat and 
resell the data in bite-sized chunks," said Jim Paris, senior associate at Los 
Angeles-based Urban Decision Systems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau tabulates data in a geographic hierarchy that begins with 
city blocks and moves through groups of blocks, cities, counties, states and 
the nation as a whole. But, for example, pulling out the precise block groups 
that are necessary to define a certain area can be a painstaking process for 
the unequipped. 
</P>
<P>
The information vendors also continually update the census information and 
develop projections by using sophisticated statistical techniques and other 
sources of information varying from state Department of Finance surveys to 
postal delivery records. Donnelley also incorporates information collected by 
other units of parent company Dun &amp; Bradstreet, such as A. C. Nielsen and 
Dun's Marketing Services. 
</P>
<P>
And for customers who want it, the information companies will go even further 
and overlay highly detailed life style profiles onto the demographic profiles. 
They'll tell you not only how much money people in a certain neighborhood make, 
how much education they have, and how many cars they own (information that 
comes directly from the census), but also what make of car they're likely to 
drive, how often they eat out, and what vacation destinations they frequent 
(information extrapolated from marketing and sociological studies). 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the census data is several times removed from its original source. 
Several years ago, Mel Curland needed more Volvos for his booming Mission Viejo 
dealership, but he was having trouble persuading executives in Sweden to give 
him a larger allocation. The tremendous affluence and high growth rates in 
southern Orange County, it seems, were not very obvious to Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
Curland needed figures to show that the people in his market area fit Volvo's 
profile of the typical Volvo customer. 
</P>
<P>
He got those figures from Market Profiles, a Costa Mesa consulting company, 
which had, in turn, purchased them from Urban Decision Systems, which itself 
had bought them from the Census Bureau and then updated them with some of its 
own data. Curland said he ultimately got the additional cars. 
</P>
<P>
Larger businesses, however, often get closer to the primary source. Census 
information can be purchased directly from the Census Bureau in printed form or 
on computer tapes, and this year for the first time some data will be offered 
on optical disks, as well. 
</P>
<P>
Buying the tapes -- at about $175 each -- is a practical option only if a 
company has a mainframe computer and some in-house programming capabilities, 
but for big companies that's not too big an obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Stiles, marketing research manager at FHP Inc., a health maintenance 
organization in Fountain Valley, said his company has purchased directly from 
the Census Bureau as well as from outside providers, but that it is now relying 
more heavily on the latter. "The bureau is a data dumper. You can filter it 
yourself, but it gets to be a headache," he said. "The vendors will organize it 
for you." 
</P>
<P>
FHP, Stiles added, uses the information for a broad variety of purposes. If the 
company is considering entering a new market area, it will look at the profile 
of the population there and see how it compares with areas where the company 
currently does well. In an existing market area, the company will compare the 
characteristics of members and non-members to see who is using the services. 
</P>
<P>
FHP also uses census data classified by ZIP code to assist in its targeted 
mailing efforts, an application that is extremely valuable for any company that 
sells its products or services via the post office. 
</P>
<P>
And though the information vendors claim that their updates are extremely 
accurate -- and that the new data from the 1990 census is therefore not a huge 
event -- some of the users are not so sure. Stiles noted that the projections 
get weaker and weaker every year beyond the census and that staying up-to-date 
is especially difficult in a fast-growing and fast-changing area such as Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 census form, although mostly unchanged from 1980, contains a few 
innovations that will make it even more useful for local businesses. For 
example, the multiple-choice question on housing value now uses $500,000 or 
over as the top classification; the old category of $200,000 or over was 
virtually useless in much of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers are excited that the census will for the first time ask about second 
mortgages, one of the hottest areas of bank lending. 
</P>
<P>
And though everyone will have to wait a couple of more years for all the 
information, the data promises to be more accessible than ever before. Not only 
are there more information vendors doing more things with it, but the Census 
Bureau itself is also working to disseminate the data in more usable forms. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Hugg, an information specialist with the Census Bureau's regional office 
in Van Nuys, noted that some information will now be available not only in 
published reports -- the basic source for seven out of 10 users -- and computer 
tapes, but also on optical disks that can be read by properly equipped personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the data is available on-line through some electronic information 
services, and the bureau will produce printouts of data that is not contained 
in published reports. 
</P>
<P>
And considering what you get, it's not very expensive. Summary reports in 
published form cost from $29 to $50, and in 1980 the entire census data bank -- 
711 mainframe computer tapes -- could be purchased for $124,425, said Paris of 
Urban Decision Systems. Hugg said there will be "thousands" of tapes for the 
1990 count, so it might be a bit more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
VALUABLE DATA: 1990 is the year of the census, and that's a boon for marketing 
strategists. The nationwide count yields unequaled demographic information.

Raytheon Co. won a $273.7-million contract to build three sophisticated 
over-the-horizon radar systems for the Navy, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The work, to be done at its manufacturing plant in Waltham and engineering 
facilities in Sudbury and Wayland, will not require new hiring but will "help 
maintain our manufacturing (employment) base," said Maria McClellan, a company 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The market for such systems could nearly quadruple to about $1 billion in the 
next few years, McClellan said. 
</P>
<P>
The current contract should be completed by July, 1993, she said.

ROSE BOWL: MICHIGAN'S SCHEMBECHLER FINISHES CAREER AT 2-8 IN PASADENA AS USC 
WINS ON LATE TOUCHDOWN.

<P>
Bo Schembechler's coaching career ended just like so many of his seasons at 
Michigan -- with a loss in the Rose Bowl and without a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
And with Bo seething at the officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing I won't miss in retirement is incompetent officials," he said 
after his 27-year coaching career ended with a 17-10 loss to No. 12 Southern 
California. "It's the most unbelievable call and I got it in my last game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a Pac-10 official and it happens every time I come out here." 
</P>
<P>
As do losses in the Rose Bowl -- Schembechler was 2-8 in the New Year's Day 
game. 
</P>
<P>
His ire was provoked by a costly penalty that turned the tide to Southern Cal 
late in the game. The Wolverines, with fourth-and-2 from their 46, picked up 24 
yards and a first down on a run by Chris Stapleton off a fake punt. 
</P>
<P>
But the play was called back on a holding penalty against Michigan. 
Schembechler then yelled at the officials, who threw a flag in his direction 
and marched off 15 more yards to go with the 10-yard assessment for holding. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines then punted, and Southern Cal began the winning drive from its 
25-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"It's over, unfortunately I lost my last game," said Schembechler, who 
announced Dec. 13 that the Rose Bowl would close his coaching career. "We 
couldn't seem to get anything going. We really did not play a very good 
football game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm mad because we lost the game, but there's nothing we can do." 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans (9-2-1), snapping a two-game losing streak in the Rose Bowl, got 
the winning touchdown on a 14-yard run by Ricky Ervins, the game's most 
valuable player, with 1:10 remaining. The score capped the 75-yard drive 
engineered by Todd Marinovich in the closing minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it was Bo's last game but we put that out of our minds," said Michigan 
safety Vida Murray. "We knew what we needed to do, but we just couldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler, whose Wolverines beat Southern Cal 22-14 in the Rose Bowl a year 
ago, will remain the school's athletic director. Assistant Gary Moeller will 
become the head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler wound up his head coaching career with a 234-65-8 record, 
including 194-48-5 during 21 years at Michigan. He finished as the fifth 
winningest coach in Division 1-A history, four behind Woody Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just the ole whistle-tooter," Schembechler said. "I have to go, but I'll 
always be Michigan." 
</P>
<P>
Southern Cal's Larry Smith, who began his college coaching career as an 
assistant under Schembechler and remains his friend, said, "I'm sorry that he's 
leaving the game. But you never apologize for winning." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a football game. He wouldn't have wanted me to coach any differently," 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Ervins, asked if it was of special significance to play against Schembechler in 
the coach's last game, said, "No. ... The fact that it was the Rose Bowl made 
it a big game." 
</P>
<P>
Ervins carried 30 times for 126 yards, and broke off tackle to score the 
winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Redshirt freshman Marinovich guided the Trojans on the winning march beginning 
with 5:15 to play, including a 20-yard completion to John Jackson on 
third-and-5 at the Michigan 44. 
</P>
<P>
USC led at the half, 10-3. But that relatively uneventful score was misleading. 
</P>
<P>
The first half of the 1990 Rose Bowl game was marked by strange decisions by 
each team. Or, in a number of cases, strange non-decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The strangest involved USC's version of a late drive before the half ended. 
After holding Michigan deep in its own territory and forcing the Wolverines 
into a punting situation, USC blithely let the clock tick seconds off while 
Michigan slowly got its punting team on the field. This despite the fact that 
the Trojans had all three of their timeouts remaining. 
</P>
<P>
When USC took over at its 26 after a punt return of eight yards by Calvin 
Holmes and a clipping penalty of 15 yards, there was only 1:37 left to play in 
the half. Shortly before Michigan fielded its punting team, there had been more 
than two minutes on the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Then, having put themselves up against much tougher odds than necessary, USC 
marched down the field like a Johnny Unitas-led pro team working a two-minute 
drill. Soon, freshman quarterback Todd Marinovich had the Trojans at the 
Michigan seven after scrambling 23 yards. But rather than call a timeout, 
Marinovich chose, strangely, to re-gather his team and set up for a snap. He 
then threw the ball over Joel Scott's head to stop the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Ervins rushed to the four, and USC took its first timeout with 27 seconds 
left. Next, Marinovich rolled left and threw into a crowd. The pass was broken 
up, but USC got another break when holding away from the ball was called 
against Michigan. That carried with it an automatic first down and put the ball 
at the Wolverine two. 
</P>
<P>
With 21 seconds to play and two timeouts left, Marinovich rolled left again, 
was rushed and clearly dumped the ball off intentionally. That's the way the 
officials called it, putting the ball back on the Michigan 19 and causing loss 
of down. 
</P>
<P>
On second down from the 19, Marinovich rolled left yet again, was rushed, but 
found Frank Griffin, a backup tight end, wide open in the middle of the field. 
Griffin caught the pass, started up field but slipped at the 16. USC was able 
to call a timeout, its second, with three seconds left, allowing Quin Rodriquez 
to kick a 34-yard field goal on the last play of the half. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the fact that Griffin slipped undoubtedly saved the Trojans. 
Through classic mismanagement of the clock, they had put themselves in a 
situation where, had he continued toward the end zone, he probably would have 
been tackled short of the goal with time elapsed. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans had thoroughly dominated the first quarter, consuming nearly five 
minutes with an opening drive that ended when Marinovich threw an interception 
at Michigan's 33. Later in the quarter, Rodriquez missed a 32-yard field goal 
that appeared to barely float over -- and wide of -- the left upright. 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, defensive guard Dan Owens broke through and blocked a 
punt by Michigan's Chris Stapleton. The ball was picked up by USC's Junior 
Seau, who returned it 24 yards to the Wolverine 11. 
</P>
<P>
But even then, it took the Trojans six plays to finally get the ball into the 
end zone, and when they did, it appeared that luck, once again, was involved. 
</P>
<P>
After USC gained a first down on fourth and inches from the two -- by inches on 
a sneak by Marinovich -- the quarterback set his team up, second and inches shy 
of the goal. He went to hand off to fullback Leroy Holt, but kept the ball 
instead and slipped over left tackle, into the end zone. The play appeared to 
be a broken handoff, because when Marinovich turned to head toward the end 
zone, he looked confused. 
</P>
<P>
With Rodriquez's kick, the score was 7-0, and Michigan had done little. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after USC passed up a possible 45-yard field goal attempt for a 
fourth-and-ten incompletion, Wolverine running back Leroy Hoard finally got 
untracked. Hoard started right and cut back over the middle for a 46-yard gain 
that set up an eventual 20-yard field goal by Michigan with 6:30 left in the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
But before J.D. Carlson put up the three points for the Wolverines, Michigan 
Coach Bo Schembechler called a halfback option pass and a quarterback draw from 
the five. 
</P>
<P>
Hoard finished the half with 86 yards rushing, significant in that the best 
full game this season against the Trojans was Tony Rice's 99 yards for Notre 
Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan managed only three first downs in the half, to 10 for USC, and the 
Wolverines were outgained, 239 yards to 127. Marinovich threw 26 times and 
completed 18 for 129 yards, that for a school that used to throw that many 
times in, say, the first four games of its season. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Hoard -- the most valuable player in the Wolverine's 22-14 
victory over USC in the 1989 Rose Bowl -- really started to get into the flow. 
The 220-pound junior from New Orleans, who scored two late touchdowns in last 
year's Rose Bowl in rushing for 142 yards against the Trojans, set up the 
Wolverines' tying touchdown with a 31-yard run midway through the period. 
</P>
<P>
As he did in his breakaway in the first half, Hoard used dazzling open-field 
moves to put Michigan in position for Allen Jefferson's two-yard scoring run 
with 4:05 to play in the third quarter that made the score 10-10.

DESPITE LOSS, BO WON'T GO OUT LIKE A LAMB

<P>
It would have been a shame for Bo Schembechler's career to end in a tie. A tie 
is -- what? A dance with your sister, a kiss from a French general, a card game 
with your aunt? A title fight shouldn't end in a draw, a war shouldn't end in a 
stalemate at Panmunjom. A great career shouldn't end in a tie. 
</P>
<P>
Golfers don't lay up in U.S. Opens, cleanup hitters don't bunt in the World 
Series, tennis players don't send up lobs in the fifth set at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
And Bo Schembechler didn't fall on the ball in the 76th Rose Bowl Monday. He 
went out with his guns out, his boots on. He didn't say "I'll play these." He 
faded the shooter. He wanted to go out the way he came in -- breathing 
defiance, daring the tiger, knocking the chip off the shoulder of the bully. 
His way. 
</P>
<P>
So, Bo didn't go out with a whimper. His team didn't tie one for the old Bo. Bo 
didn't even punt. Bo didn't just call. Bo bumped the pot, didn't stand on any 
18. He went for the pin. 
</P>
<P>
So, he didn't go out with a any chicken-salad tie. He went out a loser. 
</P>
<P>
The situation was this: Bo's Michigan team had somehow managed to tie the 
score, 10-10. No one knows how. USC was faster, deeper and, on the whole, 
niftier, than Bo's team. But they kept shooting themselves in the foot. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with about 7:30 to play, the situation was this: Bo's team had the ball on 
its 46-yard line, fourth down and two to go. You punt in that situation. Even 
if you're behind. Tied, you punt for certain. 
</P>
<P>
Bo didn't. His punter took the ball and set sail around left end for 24 yards 
to USC's 30-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
There goes the old ballgame, right? I mean, from there Michigan goes in to 
score, chewing up the clock as it goes. A game-winning call has just been made. 
A field goal at least, right? 
</P>
<P>
Well, you have to understand Bo and the Rose Bowl. What the famine was to Job, 
the plague to Joseph, the Rose Bowl was to Bo -- a hoodoo. A cross to bear. 
</P>
<P>
Bo's first Rose Bowl game, he had a heart attack. And the situation went 
downhill from there. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a game, it was a jinx. Bo lost two Rose Bowl games because enemy 
teams failed to punt on fourth down in their own territory. Stanford did it to 
him in 1972. Washington did it in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
So, Bo finally turned the tables? Guess again. As the play is finished, this 
little yellow handkerchief comes fluttering out on the field. Play nullified. 
Victory nullified. Ten-yard penalty. Bo is entitled to say, "Me again, huh, 
God?" 
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines, Bo goes quietly crazy. He swells up with rage, charges the 
official. He is berserk. 
</P>
<P>
Bad Bo. Fifteen-yard penalty. Move the ball back to the Michigan 21. 
</P>
<P>
Now, punt. Now, fold the hand. Take back the blue chips. 
</P>
<P>
That was the pivotal part of the game. Bottom line: Bo loses again. He's 2-8 in 
the Rose Bowl. This is a coach who is 194-47-5 at Michigan. He was good enough 
to come to 10 Rose Bowls. He always showed up with a smart, well-drilled, 
resourceful, take-no-prisoners, coal yard type of football team. 
Over-achievers, really. 
</P>
<P>
He may have cost his team this Rose Bowl. The resultant punt, after Bo's 
tantrum and penalty, from the 21 is barely adequate. USC is in position to 
mount a closing drive that produced a touchdown with 1:10 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
The betting in the press interview room is even-money whether Bo will show up 
after this dismal loss. His mentor, the late Woody Hayes, would have stayed in 
the bunker and licked his wounds and cursed the Fates -- to say nothing of the 
refs. 
</P>
<P>
If he does show up, the betting is 1-to-5 he'll be coming into the room like a 
crashing plane. Aflame and spewing destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Bo is smiling as he enters the room. He is leaving the Rose Bowl as he entered 
it -- a loser. 
</P>
<P>
Only he doesn't act like one. Bo is downright jovial. His team is sobbing in 
the dressing room, he admits, but Bo is still full of fight. Bo doesn't cry. Bo 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
It is reminiscent of the time Joe Louis lay in a locker room after being 
knocked out by Rocky Marciano. Around him, people are tearing their hair, 
ripping their garments, crying out to the heavens. Louis opened an eye, looked 
up. "Hey!" he protested. "I knocked out lots of guys!" 
</P>
<P>
Bo didn't go out crying. He knocked out lots of guys, too. 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't forgive the officials. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all," he said, "we didn't deserve to win the game. We were miserable 
in the first half. I don't think we played well all day. It surprised me we 
gave up so many yards. Was SC faster than us? Well, we didn't think so going 
in." 
</P>
<P>
The call that cost him all chance at the 1990 Rose Bowl game was not so 
charitably viewed by Bo. "Most unbelievable call," Bo said, shaking his head. 
But he was smiling as he said it. "It was the most ridiculous call ever and, if 
I see the films and decide it was justified, I will be glad to retract. Was it 
a Pac-10 official? Naturally! But I will say that the worst call ever made on 
me here was by a Big Ten official once. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, one guy said it was called because of blocking below the waist. Another 
said it was old-fashioned holding. I'll guarantee you it was a late call. 
</P>
<P>
"Will they take it up with the supervisory officials? Listen, I want you to 
know, in the history of the game, according to supervisory officials, there has 
never been a bad call. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to know what my humble opinion is? My humble opinion is that the game 
has passed up (the capabilities) of all amateur officials. It's too fast, it's 
too complex. It should have competent, professional officials." 
</P>
<P>
So, the Rose Bowl is not going to have Bo Schembechler to kick around any more. 
It's probably fitting he went out the way he came in. The Rose Bowl remained 
his bete noire to the end, the cloud over his head, his personal hex. 
</P>
<P>
Bo never got the hang of it. He never lost by more than a touchdown except once 
when he lost by 10 points -- to UCLA in '83. He never flinched, got reckless, 
or even played the game of a desperate man. The Rose Bowl always knew it was in 
a fight. 
</P>
<P>
Bo could beat Ohio State, Bo could win Big Ten titles, Bo could even beat Notre 
Dame if it came to that. Bo was just overmatched by a hex, not a team. 
Actually, he almost beat USC -- and the hex -- Monday. He took his shot. The 
Rose Bowl just got on its broom and flew away, cackling. The old bawd never 
gave Bo an honest cut of the cards. 
</P>
<P>
Bo will miss the Rose Bowl. But not as much as the Rose Bowl will miss Bo.

</P>

ORANGE BOWL: NOTRE DAME DODGES FIRST-HALF BULLETS, THEN SHOOTS A ROCKET AT 
PREVIOUSLY UNBEATEN COLORADO, 21-6. HOLTZ SAYS IRISH SHOULD BE NO. 1.

MIAMI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A campaign began, a dream ended Monday night as Notre Dame defeated Colorado, 
21-6, in an Orange Bowl game that sent shivers down the national rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado began the night as No. 1, but didn't end it there. Notre Dame, ranked 
fourth -- for now -- saw to that as it granted the Buffaloes three first-half 
scoring wishes and survived to tell about it. 
</P>
<P>
After that, the Irish unleashed Raghib (The Rocket) Ismail, their little 
speedburner of a tailback, who left powder burns on a stunned CU defense and 
caused a packed house of 81,191 to shake their heads in admiration. His 110 
rushing yards, 83 of them in the second half, helped break open a game that was 
0-0 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Ismail was presented with the most valuable player award and 
a miniature Orange Bowl trophy, which he carried as easily as he toted the 
Irish offense Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Ismail scored once in the third quarter, on a 35-yard reverse, and fullback 
Anthony Johnson added two other short touchdown runs to give Notre Dame a 
victory in a place that has haunted them for years. At last, the Irish left 
this aging stadium with a win, their first in their last six tries. 
</P>
<P>
And if you can believe Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz, the Irish also left with 
another national championship, which would be their second in as many seasons. 
According to Holtz, Notre Dame's convincing victory over Colorado negated 
anything that happened between Miami and Alabama at the Sugar Bowl. To make his 
point, Holtz delivered a stern sermon to the assembled press, some of whom will 
cast ballots for the Associated Press final poll. 
</P>
<P>
"I can honestly say right now that we got the best record and the toughest 
schedule," Holtz said. "And I don't know how you can decide on anyone else 
being No. 1. Now that's my personal opinion. Unless you want to say, 'Who was 
the best team on Nov. 25?' (the night Notre Dame lost to Miami and lost its No. 
1 ranking). We did not play well, we came off an emotional victory at Penn 
State. 
</P>
<P>
"But we played the toughest schedule and had the best record and we were No. 1 
for 11 weeks. The one week we're out of No. 1, we come back and beat No. 1 by 
15 points." 
</P>
<P>
Holtz's voice took on a frosty edge, as if he wanted all to know precisely how 
he felt about the poll war that will be waged between Notre Dame and Miami 
until the rankings are made public today. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to campaign or anything like that, but I just believe in my 
heart that if you have the best record against the toughest schedule . . . case 
rest." 
</P>
<P>
As if Holtz wasn't forceful enough, quarterback Tony Rice offered his postgame 
assessment of the voting process. 
</P>
<P>
"We have played 13 games and won 12 of them," he said. "We beat the undefeated, 
No. 1 team. We deserve to be No. 1. We better be No. 1!" 
</P>
<P>
It is a situation filled with ironies. In a way, Notre Dame, playing in the 
stadium used by the Hurricanes, might have helped Miami's cause more than its 
own. Maybe that's why Miami offered the Irish use of its practice facilities 
and locker room. 
</P>
<P>
Should Notre Dame squeeze past Miami in the final rankings, it can thank the 
Irish defense for confounding a Buffalo offense used to scoring early and 
often. Colorado quarterback Darian Hagan completed just four of 13 passes, 
which tended to diminish the importance of his 116 rushing yards and one 
scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt very confident in the huddle, but unfortunately, we'd get it down 
close and couldn't punch it in," Hagan said. "It wasn't frustrating at first, 
but in the second half we didn't play with as much intensity. They went up, 
14-0, and we wanted to show we weren't going to lie down. But we didn't come up 
with enough points." 
</P>
<P>
It's not as if they didn't have their chances. The Buffaloes will forever 
remember the first half and what might have been. And if they don't, someone 
ought to remind them. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of quarters came and went and with it, at least three Colorado scoring 
opportunities, maybe four if you count Notre Dame's Tony Rice nearly being 
tackled for a safety. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado's offense wasn't choosy with its mistakes. It fumbled away a sure 
touchdown, missed a chip-shot field goal, failed three times from the Notre 
Dame one-yard line and then botched a questionable fake field goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Three times inside the Notre Dame 20. Zero points. 
</P>
<P>
The Colorado offensive line couldn't be faulted. So wide were the running lanes 
in the first half that Ralphie, the buffalo mascot, could have dashed through 
untouched. Instead, tailback Eric Bieniemy, back in the lineup after missing 
half of the season with a broken leg, and Hagan did the honors on the 
Buffaloes' first failed scoring drive. 
</P>
<P>
Down the field Colorado went until, with a second-and-five from the Irish 35, 
Bieniemy burst through the line on what appeared to be a clear path to the end 
zone. About halfway there, Bieniemy tried switching the ball from his left to 
right hand . . . and dropped it. Notre Dame recovered. 
</P>
<P>
One possession later, after using 11 plays to move to the Notre Dame five-yard 
line, Colorado kicker Ken Culbertson jogged onto the field for a 23-yard field 
goal attempt. Moments later, his skulled attempt barely cleared the line before 
swerving far left of the upright. 
</P>
<P>
Gone were three more points. 
</P>
<P>
The frustration didn't end with Culbertson's shank. Colorado got the ball back, 
promptly drove to the Irish one-yard line, where the Buffaloes failed three 
consecutive times to squirm into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
On fourth-and-three, Culbertson returned for a 20-yard attempt. Ram Coach John 
Robinson can empathize with what happened next. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than let Culbertson kick away, the Buffaloes had holder Jeff Campbell 
try for a touchdown. Campbell took the snap, looked for a receiver and then 
dashed for the right corner of the end zone. It would have been a fine play had 
Notre Dame defensive tackle Troy Ridgely not been waiting for him at the two. 
</P>
<P>
Poof went another three points, six if Colorado had been able to punch it in 
from the one. 
</P>
<P>
So what could have been perhaps a 17-point halftime lead, became a series of 
calamities that ultimately took their toll on the Buffaloes. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming away from the first half without any points, after controlling the game 
for a while, was too much to overcome," Colorado Coach Bill McCartney said. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame had only one scoring opportunity in the first half and also blew it. 
After a series of timeouts, Bill Hackett's 27-yard field goal was blocked, 
ending two quarters of frustration.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE'S NOT A QUARTERBACK SINCE TEAM PUT QUARTER IN THE RACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former USC quarterback Sean Salisbury might be the first pro football player to 
be cut because of a quote in a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Salisbury led the Winnipeg Blue Bombers to the 1988 Grey Cup championship, and 
then, in 16 games this season, passed for 26 touchdowns, including six in one 
game, and nearly 4,100 yards. But he was cut with one week left in the Canadian 
Football League's regular season. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Bombers, it seems, were upset about a quote that appeared in the Times 
Oct. 25. It was included in a story that said Salisbury, who was in the midst 
of the contract dispute with the team, could become the biggest sports star in 
Winnipeg if he would commit to a long-term contract. 
</P>
<P>
Salisbury was quoted: "That I would love to stay in Winnipeg is . . . a little 
far-fetched. I tell the people that in the media here so they'll get off my 
back. But I'd love to stay?" 
</P>
<P>
Salisbury was benched in the second quarter of the next game and was cut the 
next day. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know whether to laugh or cry," said Salisbury, who is living in 
Denver. "There was nothing wrong with the article, and I knew they (Blue Bomber 
executives) would probably see it. The whole thing turned into a debacle. It 
was a nightmare. I thought I'd never wake up." 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, Salisbury has found a silver lining. "It turned out to be a 
blessing," he said. "Now I'm a free agent and can get an early start shopping 
my services to the NFL. There's already been some interest." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Jan. 2, 1961, who passed for three touchdowns and kicked a 
field goal and the extra points to give the Houston Oilers a 24-16 victory over 
the then-Los Angeles Chargers in the first American Football League 
championship game? 
</P>
<P>
Out of the kitchen: Jerry Reynolds, promoted to the front office of the 
Sacramento Kings, says he finally realized he was too thin-skinned to be an NBA 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds told the Sacramento Bee Saturday that he was listening to a sports 
talk show while driving home after a game when a fan called to criticize the 
coach for misusing his timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
"He was saying I had called a dumb timeout," Reynolds said. "He didn't even 
know that the timeout in question was a mandatory one. The refs called it, not 
me. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought to myself, 'Why, you dumb s.o.b.! And that's the kind of thing I 
have to get used to?' I knew I'd never get used to that. 
</P>
<P>
"Some coaches can take it, but they're wired different than me. They're 
hard-shelled. The bad doesn't affect them like it does me. That's the kind of 
guy we're looking for to replace me." 
</P>
<P>
Waxing successful: John Randall, 39, a mail handler at the U.S. Postal 
Service's main station in Portland, had a winning 14-game ticket in Oregon's 
NFL lottery last week -- his second in seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"People call me 'Hot Candle' Randall," he said, "and when I'm hot, I'm really 
hot." 
</P>
<P>
Randall was one of three who won $15,165.80 last week. His other winner was 
worth $12,560. 
</P>
<P>
His secret? 
</P>
<P>
"I can read between the lines on the statistics, and I've followed certain 
players since they were in college," Randall said. "I know which ones are 
winners and which ones are losers." 
</P>
<P>
Randall said he is eager to play Oregon's NBA lottery beginning this week. "The 
ball in basketball is round," he said, "and the game should have a little more 
consistency than football." 
</P>
<P>
Perfectly clear: Pete Arbogast, the KNX radio announcer for Saturday's 
USC-Northern Arizona basketball game, on Trojan reserve Josh Oppenheimer: 
</P>
<P>
"He's from Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks. There's a Notre Dame High 
School in Riverside. That's why you've got the different pronunciations." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: George Blanda. 
</P>

HE WAS A TOWER OF POWER ON USC'S WINNING DRIVE; 
</P>
<P>
MVP: RICKY ERVINS, WHO CARRIED THE FOOTBALL 30 TIMES FOR 126 YARDS, SAYS THE 
TROJANS WORE DOWN THE WOLVERINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When USC needed a big play on the ground, they ran a simple off-tackle blast 
with tailback Ricky Ervins carrying the ball behind the blocking of fullback 
Leroy Holt. 
</P>
<P>
In the Trojans' playbook, the play is called "86," which calls for quarterback 
Todd Marinovich to roll outside his strongside tackle and hand off to Ervins. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing fancy, just power football. But against Michigan in Monday's Rose Bowl 
game, it was a play that buried the Wolverines. 
</P>
<P>
With a first down on Michigan's 14-yard line with 1:21 remaining, the Trojans 
again called on Ervins. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be the last time they would need the Rose Bowl game MVP. 
Behind Holt and pulling strongside guard Mark Tucker, Ervins powered into the 
Wolverines' secondary and received a key block from Gary Wellman. He ran over 
Michigan All-American safety Tripp Welborne at the seven-yard line and 
high-stepped into the end zone, ending USC's two-game losing streak in the Rose 
Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
"All game long, they couldn't stop it," Ervins said about the "86" play. "We 
just wore them down at the end." 
</P>
<P>
On the final drive, USC needed 11 plays to travel 75 yards, but after reaching 
Michigan's 24-yard line, the Trojans were content to keep the ball on the 
ground to set up a game-winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
But in the huddle before Ervins' touchdown, the Trojans were confident that 
they could score a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd came into the huddle and told us that we are going to score on this 
play," Ervins said. "All I said was, 'Oh really?' " 
</P>
<P>
What made Marinovich so sure of his prediction was the Trojans' previous 
blocking success with the play. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the play) worked all day," Marinovich said. "I told the line to stay on 
their blocks a little longer and he (Ervins) will score, just like he did." 
</P>
<P>
With All-Pacific 10 tight end Scott Galbraith helping senior tackle Bill 
Schultz on a double-team block of Michigan defensive tackle Sylvester Stanley, 
the Trojans were able to open a hole for Holt and Tucker to clear for Ervins. 
</P>
<P>
"We were this close from breaking it every time we had ran it," Galbraith said, 
holding his thumb and index finger an inch apart. "Their defensive line was big 
and strong, but I was surprised that they were so blockable." 
</P>
<P>
USC quarterback coach Ray Dorr, who did most of the play calling from the press 
box, said that Coach Larry Smith called for the winning play. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Smith said that he wanted to run the ball off-tackle to run off some of 
the clock," Dorr said. "When I heard he had made the call, I said 'Great.' It 
wasn't a hard call." 
</P>
<P>
USC did not use the play until its sixth game against California. 
</P>
<P>
"The play has always worked for us," Tucker said. "And today, we knew that 
Ricky was close to breaking it into the end zone every time we ran it. 
</P>
<P>
"They never made any kind of adjustments and they never were able to stop it. 
When I pull around like that, it becomes like a sweep for me." 
</P>
<P>
Ervins, a junior, began the season as third-string tailback. On his first "86" 
carry, Ervins gained 12 yards. He carried 30 times for 126 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"The offensive line was blocking great all game," Ervins said, who used to work 
as a Rose Bowl parking attendant when he played at Pasadena Muir High. "Early 
in the game I was not hitting the right holes, but they where there. It was 
just up to me to make the runs." 
</P>
<P>
It was Ervins' eighth 100-yard rushing game of the season and he finished with 
1,395 yards, 12th in school history. He joins Charles White (1979 and 1980), 
Sam Cunningham (1973), O.J. Simpson (1968) and Erny Pinckett (1932) as Trojan 
running backs named Rose Bowl game MVP.

TELEVISION: A HARD DAY'S NIGHT OF FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, there can be too much football. 
</P>
<P>
There was some good football on New Year's Day -- particularly for USC, Notre 
Dame and Miami fans -- but seven games in one day is about four too many. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL presents a nice, neat postseason tournament, culminating with Super 
Bowl Sunday. What the colleges present is a mess. 
</P>
<P>
Watching seven games within an 11-hour span is enough to make your head spin 
more than a New Year's Day hangover. 
</P>
<P>
The first game Monday was the Hall of Fame Bowl, which began shortly after 10 
a.m. The last one, the Sugar Bowl, didn't end until 9:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
ABC made the most of its late sign-off and asked viewers to call in their votes 
for the No. 1 team in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
At last count, Notre Dame had a pretty healthy lead over Miami, 55% to 26%, 
after 50,000 calls. 
</P>
<P>
NBC and ABC each televised three games and CBS one. 
</P>
<P>
NBC got a head start on ABC with the Hall of Fame Bowl starting a half-hour 
earlier than the Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
NBC had to cut away from its coverage of the Rose Parade a little early, but at 
least it didn't run into the overlapping problems later in the day that ABC 
did. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's Hall of Fame Bowl ended at 1:27 p.m. and the network wasted little time 
switching to the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
It was a far better switch than ABC's from the Citrus Bowl to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
ABC planned to be on the air from Pasadena at 1:45 p.m., and the kickoff was 
scheduled for shortly after 2. 
</P>
<P>
But, as things turned out, the kickoff was delayed until 2:21. 
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the delay was that the Citrus Bowl didn't end until 2:03. 
Then, making matters worse, ABC took its time making the switch, to say the 
least. 
</P>
<P>
After the Citrus Bowl was over, ABC showed a promotional spot for the upcoming 
Rose Bowl. Thanks, but we knew it was coming. 
</P>
<P>
Then came a promo for ABC Sports, then a "thank you" promotional spot to an 
airline that provides free air travel. 
</P>
<P>
There were two promos for ABC shows, followed by a news brief. 
</P>
<P>
It was almost 2:10. 
</P>
<P>
What next? Three consecutive commercials and a Channel 7 promo for Todd 
Donoho's "New Year's Live" postgame show. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Donoho's show wasn't bad. He played it pretty straight, and his 
look-a-likes segment was interesting. John Robinson and Duke Snider was one of 
his best. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, ABC was still a long way from the Rose Bowl kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
After some ABC Sports graphics, there was a Big Ten promo, then more graphics 
and finally a glimpse of the Rose Bowl, where the crowd was completing the 
national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
Then came an intro from announcer Keith Jackson and another taped piece on 
Schembechler, this one showing a 1971 pep talk. 
</P>
<P>
Next was another commercial, then a Pacific 10 promo followed by one more 
commercial. 
</P>
<P>
At 2:16, the teams took the field, and Jackson and commentator Bob Griese 
offered a little pregame analysis. 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl kickoff came 18 minutes after the end of the Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
ABC had met with Rose Bowl officials at about 1 p.m. and asked for a later 
kickoff, so the teams knew what was coming. 
</P>
<P>
But it was unnerving to viewers at home and fans at the game, making them wait 
and wait. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-minute break wouldn't have been so bad had ABC not crammed in all those 
commercials and promos. 
</P>
<P>
There were 20 minutes between the Fiesta Bowl and Orange Bowl on NBC, but that 
network used the time mostly for analysis and features. 
</P>
<P>
It used the time for only a few commercials and promos. 
</P>
<P>
ABC producer Bob Goodrich, who was in charge of the Rose Bowl coverage, had 
plenty of material planned for his pregame show, but someone higher up at ABC 
decided against using it. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Goodrich, director Larry Kamm, announcers Jackson and Griese and the 
rest of the ABC crew put out an excellent Rose Bowl telecast -- once it got 
going. 
</P>
<P>
ABC got some definitive shots the holding call on Michigan's fake punt in the 
fourth quarter, but the most conclusive shot wasn't shown until halftime of the 
Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
It showed that Michigan's Bobby Abrams held, but it was far away from the play 
and the flag was late. 
</P>
<P>
Usually sideline reporters offer little, but NBC's O.J. Simpson came up with 
some good information during the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson, working the Colorado sideline while Ralph Wiley handled the Notre Dame 
bench, explained why the entire teams of both schools went on the field before 
the kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said when the Colorado players saw the whole Notre Dame team coming 
out, they did the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson also explained what went wrong on Colorado's fake field goal try early 
in the game, pointing out that the key receiver forgot to run a pattern. 
</P>
<P>
In the Orange Bowl booth, Dick Enberg and Bill Walsh had one of their best 
games. It was refreshing to hear how excited Walsh was. 
</P>
<P>
He even apologized for a profanity. Actually, all he said was 'that was a 
helluva play." 
</P>
<P>
Viewers of the Hall of Fame Bowl saw one of the all-time hits when Ohio State's 
Zack Dumas leveled Auburn's Stacy Danley. 
</P>
<P>
Announcer Don Criqui first said: "That's got to be the hardest hit of the 
'89-90 bowl season." 
</P>
<P>
Then, after viewing a replay, Criqui said: "It's the hardest hit I've seen in 
football in years." 
</P>
<P>
Criqui at one point forgot he was at the Hall of Fame Bowl. Talking about 
Auburn's Shayne Wasden's punt returns of 30 and 34 yards, he said they broke 
the Orange Bowl record. 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe you can't blame Criqui for being confused. He worked the last eight 
Orange Bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of flubs, Simpson, during halftime of the Hall of Fame Bowl, referred 
to Notre Dame's George Gipp as George Kemp. However, Simpson did catch the 
mistake and corrected it. 
</P>
<P>
In referring to Gipp's death, comparing it to the death of Colorado quarterback 
Sal Aunese, Simpson said it occurred a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Colleague Bob Costas, fearing Simpson's attempt at sarcasm was probably lost on 
most viewers, added: "It was more than a few years ago. It was so long ago that 
a young Ronald Reagan could play Gipp (in the 1940 movie, 'Knute Rockne -- All 
American')." 
</P>
<P>
During halftime of the Fiesta Bowl, Gayle Gardner -- yes, she still works for 
NBC -- had an excellent feature on the once-troubled Colorado football program 
and the death of Aunese last September. 
</P>
<P>
CBS deserves kudos for the halftime piece it showed during the Cotton Bowl. It 
chronicled the highlights of college football during the 1980s, including 
California's 1982 kickoff against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
NBC broke a story Monday afternoon that Notre Dame defensive coordinator Barry 
Alvarez would be leaving the school to become head coach at Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
The network had Wiley interview Alvarez later in the day, but because of 
technical problems, had to cut away from it earlier than planned. 
</P>
<P>
On this day and night of football, the coverage and the announcing, overall, 
was fine. 
</P>
<P>
It's just that something needs to be done about the logjam. The way things are 
now, it's impossible to see everything. 
</P>
<P>
And that's depriving viewers. You don't see the NFL scheduling seven games on 
Super Bowl Sunday.

MARINOVICH GOES FROM A COLT TO A TROJAN HORSE; 
</P>
<P>
QUARTERBACK: THERE WERE A LOT OF DOUBTERS WHEN THE SEASON STARTED, BUT NEARLY 
EVERYBODY BELIEVES IN HIS TALENT NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For just a moment, between the waves of reporters coming at him to ask 
questions, the tall red-haired player with the cocksure smile looked around and 
studied all that had become his domain. 
</P>
<P>
It was only a messy locker room, strewn with everything from shoes and socks to 
supporters, both the elastic and human kind. 
</P>
<P>
But to the young man named Marinovich, age 20 going on 45, it was everything 
that boyhood dreams are made of. All around him, fellow USC football players, 
most of them older and most of them doubters when he first came on the scene, 
sang his praises. Reporters not only asked him about him; they asked them about 
him. 
</P>
<P>
The phrase "born leader" came from one of his receivers, junior Frank Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
Another receiver, senior John Jackson, called him "my right-hand man, even if 
he is left-handed." 
</P>
<P>
Yet another, the team's leader in spirit and machismo, senior All-American Tim 
Ryan, a defensive tackle, called him "precocious" and added that he "has become 
a great player and a great friend of mine." 
</P>
<P>
So it was at the Rose Bowl Monday for Todd Marinovich, the freshman quarterback 
from Capistrano Valley. In one of the toughest situations in sport, the 
pressure of the closing minutes of a tied Rose Bowl game, Marinovich had 
delivered. 
</P>
<P>
He had taken his Trojans on a late drive, had set up the winning touchdown with 
a key third-down pass to his buddy, Jackson, and had called the winning 
touchdown play, an off-tackle blast by Ricky Ervins, like he was Bobby Layne 
with a full-week's growth of beard. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd said we'd run 86 off right tackle," Ervins said. "He said it would work, 
that it would go all the way. I said, 'Oh, really.' He said it would go. Next 
thing, I just walked into the end zone." Marinovich's version was similar, yet 
more understated. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told the linemen to stay on their blocks a bit longer on this one, that 
it'd go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And said like a true veteran, a guy with 20 games or so under his belt. He 
didn't spit on the floor when he said it, but he could have. 
</P>
<P>
So much has happened to Marinovich since Pat O'Hara went down with a knee 
injury scant days before USC was to open against Illinois; since he fairly well 
stunk out the joint against the Fighting Illini and had his older, grizzled 
teammates beseeching the heavens for an alternative to this local kid with 
mouth to match press clippings. 
</P>
<P>
Just six months after his 20th birthday, he had completed 197 passes for 2,400 
yards and 16 touchdowns, had led the Trojans to an 8-2-1 record, a Pac-10 title 
and had led his team into the Rose Bowl. The doubters were now believers. 
</P>
<P>
And after passing for 178 yards, rushing for 35 more and engineering the late 
75-yard scoring drive that ended Bo Schembechler's career with a boo, 
Marinovich had truly come of age. The colt had become a real Trojan horse. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't ask for anything more from him," said Jackson, who caught five 
passes for 56 yards, ended the season with 62 and established a Pac-10 record 
with a reception in his 37th consecutive game Monday. "As a receiver, your MVP 
has to be the quarterback. When he took over at the beginning of the year, we 
were all worried. But he worked with me, we kept at it, and I can say now that 
Todd has had more to do than anybody with my career blossoming like it has." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the game's key connection was Marinovich to Jackson with just over two 
minutes left. It was third down and five at Michigan's 44, and this drive was 
going to be it for the Trojans. Do or be tied. Marinovich went back, found 
Jackson in the middle of the field, and USC was suddenly looking very rosy at 
the Wolverine 24. Four plays later, it was 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm supposed to be reading on that play, looking over everybody," Marinovich 
said. "But the truth is, I just looked at John, watched him all the way. And 
there he was." 
</P>
<P>
To Jackson, it was equally simple. 
</P>
<P>
"Surprisingly, that was the only time all day that we called that play," he 
said. "I noticed their linebackers weren't getting back far enough, and they 
didn't on that play, so I just curled into a spot and the ball was there, just 
like it always is." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson wasn't surprised. A story about the first Marinovich-to-Jackson 
connection explained why. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't like me to tell this, but he said it's OK today, and we still kid 
about it a lot," Jackson said, recalling a scenario with Marinovich that goes 
back to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a senior at Bishop Amat High School," Jackson said. "He was at Mater 
Dei, before he transferred to Capistrano Valley. Even back then, when he was 
really just a kid, he was the whole show. Our whole defense was geared for him. 
They sent four guys out for passes on every play. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, this night, I catch three touchdown passes and we win, 28-8. But the 
thing I remembered more than anything else is that I played defense, too, back 
then and I made a pick (interception) against him. I think that was an omen. 
That was 60-some receptions ago, the start of a real good hookup." 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of Jackson's story, Marinovich walked past, smiled and said, "He 
was just lucky that night." 
</P>
<P>
Then he swaggered off into the night, looking part Ken Stabler and part Clint 
Eastwood. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson watched him leave, sighed, and said, "I wish I had a couple of years of 
eligibility left."

SCHEMBECHLER GOES OUT IN (HIS) STYLE; 
</P>
<P>
COACH: BO THROWS A FIT IN HIS FINAL GAME ON SIDELINES, THEN BERATES OFFICIALS 
IN HIS FINAL POSTGAME INTERVIEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It seems only fitting that Bo Schembechler bowed out of coaching on what he 
perceived as an unbelievable call by an official. 
</P>
<P>
And, it occurred, of course, at the Rose Bowl, where Bo has been been burned so 
often in the past, either by an official or an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler said his team didn't deserve to beat USC Monday in the 76th Rose 
Bowl game and it didn't, losing, 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he was emphatic that a holding call assessed against his team on a 
successful run on a fake punt in the fourth quarter should not have been made. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't the end of it, either. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler seemingly risked another heart attack as he fumed on the 
sidelines. He threw down his clipboard, got tangled in the wires of his headset 
and almost fell. And he was cited for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The score was tied, 10-10, when Chris Stapleton went back in punt formation on 
fourth-and-two from the Michigan 46-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Stapleton fooled USC's defenders and took off around left end for 24 yards. But 
the big play was nullified. Michigan linebacker Bobby Abrams was the apparent 
offender as he was called for holding on the play. 
</P>
<P>
That was a 10-yard penalty. Then Schembechler, storming on the sidelines, drew 
another 15 yards for unsportsmanlike conduct as he screamed at the officials. 
</P>
<P>
So Michigan had to punt again, losing field position, and the Trojans then 
drove 75 yards to the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing I won't miss in retirement is incompetent officials," 
Schembechler said. "It's the most unbelievable call I've ever seen and I got it 
in my last game. " 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler had already announced his retirement as Michigan's coach a few 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler said that Abrams shoved an unidentified USC player which, in his 
opinion, was perfectly legal. 
</P>
<P>
"The call the guy (line judge Charles Czubin) made to me was blocking below the 
waist," Schembechler said. "Then, they tell me he went on to the referee (Jim 
Kemerling) and said it was a holding call." 
</P>
<P>
When asked which official threw the flag, Schembechler brightened and said: 
</P>
<P>
"The most incompetent one. The call was ridiculous. If I see the film I'll 
retract it. But every indication I had from people in the press box (his 
coaches) and people who saw it on television was that it was a ridiculous call. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it was fate because we played so poorly that the Lord wanted the right 
team to win." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler said he was aware that the call was made by a Pac-10 official. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I do know that. And it happens every time. One of the things they should 
do in this game, in my judgment, is to have a neutral crew. 
</P>
<P>
"This business of split crews doesn't work out. Don't get me wrong. The worst 
call I've ever had was by a Big Ten official out here. But this one ranks." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler was referring to USC tailback Charles White's phantom touchdown in 
the 1979 Rose Bowl game. White was credited with a touchdown even though 
television instant replay clearly showed that he lost the ball on the 
three-yard line on his dive into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure I was angry because I knew it was a bad call," Schembechler said, 
referring again to the holding on the fake punt. "You'd be angry, too. We had a 
shot at that time." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't clearly evident on instant replay whether Abrams was guilty of 
holding. 
</P>
<P>
Abrams said he didn't hold and didn't know that he was the culprit until 
informed by some of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
USC linebacker Bruce Luizzi, who was defending as an end on the play, said that 
he was definitely held, but he insisted that Michigan safety Tripp Welborne 
committed the infraction. "I said, 'He's holding me, he's holding me,' and the 
official dropped the flag," Luizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
Someone asked Schembechler if he contributed to his team's defeat with his 
unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"I contributed greatly," Bo acknowledged, "but the call shouldn't have been 
thrown on me. He (the referee) backed up his buddy." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler made it clear, though, that Michigan didn't deserve to win. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't seem to get anything going," he said. "I'm surprised our defense 
gave up so much yardage. We were fortunate to be only seven down at halftime." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler didn't want to detract from USC, though, saying the Trojans 
deserved to win and were the best team Michigan has met other than Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler wasn't through berating the officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The game has passed up almost all amateur officials. The game is too fast, too 
complicated. They don't have enough training. They're not pros. They have other 
jobs. So you will get those things. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't go out and find another official to make that call." 
</P>
<P>
Then, Schembechler became sentimental. He is leaving Michigan as head coach 
after 21 years, but he'll remain as athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was the last time. I'll be in sports again," he said. "I won't be on 
the field ever. I'm no longer a field coach. I'll be in the background 
somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
"I'll always be a Michigan man. Michigan is my school." 
</P>
<P>
As for the Rose Bowl, where he said goodby with a 2-8 record and some 
questionable calls by his reckoning, the historic stadium won't be prominent in 
his memoirs.

SANTA ANITA; 
</P>
<P>
AKINEMOD MIGHT NOT KNOW IT, BUT SHE MIGHT BE QUITE A FILLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With her easy victory Monday in the $107,650 La Brea Breeders' Cup Stakes at 
Santa Anita, Akinemod ran her win streak to five, the only blemish on her 
record coming when she was a troubled fourth in her debut last April. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a filly who still hasn't figured out exactly what she's supposed to 
be doing for a living. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a big game to her," said Gary Stevens after steering the Time To 
Explode filly to a two-length win over Fantastic Look. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel she knows what she's doing. I still feel there's room for 
improvement." 
</P>
<P>
This would be disheartening news to those who chased her home Monday. After 
battling with Pat Copelan and Linda Card through a :22 and :44 1/5 half, she 
opened up by 2 1/2 lengths about a furlong from the finish. Fantastic Look, the 
beneficiary of a perfect trip and who looked dangerous around the turn, could 
make no impact late. 
</P>
<P>
Covering the seven furlongs in 1:21 3/5, the 6-5 favorite earned herself a 
start in the middle leg of the La Canada series, the El Encino Stakes Jan. 15. 
That would mark her initial venture around two turns, and among her likely 
opponents is Breeders' Cup Distaff runner-up Gorgeous. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how far she wants to go, but we'll run her in the next one and 
see," said Jerry Fanning, who trains Akinemod for owner Jack Klugman. "I wasn't 
so much worried about the speed in the race as when I saw (Fantastic Look) 
coming up so fast. 
</P>
<P>
"But Akinemod just kept running. She finished well and she's just a good 
filly." 
</P>
<P>
Although she had never bled in a race, Akinemod did so in her Dec. 22 work and 
that's why she ran with Lasix Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We scoped her and it kind of worried us a little," Fanning said. "We gave her 
Lasix for her next work (Dec. 28) and if she hadn't worked well with it, we 
wouldn't have run her with Lasix." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, who has ridden her in half of her lifetime starts, thinks Akinemod 
will handle a distance of ground. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel it's going to be any problem," he said. "She galloped out real 
strong and I didn't get her pulled up until the middle of the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
"She's real relaxed early and she's not speed crazy. She relaxed well today 
with a horse inside (Linda Card) of her and a horse (Pat Copelan) outside of 
her. She's a natural athlete. She's got more natural ability than 90% of them." 
</P>
<P>
Akinemod's victory completed a dream afternoon for Klugman. In the opener, his 
Flor 'em Jak, a 4-year-old Jaklin Klugman gelding, broke his maiden at first 
asking. He is also trained by Fanning and was ridden by Stevens, who was aboard 
three winners Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like being reborn," Klugman said. "My heart is going a mile a minute. I 
think I've owned two winners on one card once before in my life and that was 
years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Fantastic Look, the 9-2 second choice, was 3 1/2 lengths clear of Reluctant 
Guest, then came Affirmed Classic, Kiwi, Linda Card, Stocks Up and Pat Copelan. 
</P>
<P>
Opening Verse, the unluckiest loser the first week of the meeting, may come 
back in the San Fernando Stakes a week from Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Trained by Richard Lundy and owned by Allen Paulson, Opening Verse made his 
U.S. and main track debut in Sunday's seventh race. The 4-year-old son of The 
Minstrel drew the rail in the classified allowance mile, moved up comfortably 
to be just off the leaders down the backside, then had nowhere to go almost the 
rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
When he finally did get some room, it was too late and he was beaten a 
half-length by Attesa, the longest shot in the field who had rallied from last 
and had clear sailing outside. 
</P>
<P>
"He sure proved he had a lot of heart in that race," said Pat Mitchell, Lundy's 
assistant. "He was ready to run some more when he came back to unsaddle. He was 
fine this morning and the plan is to nominate him to the San Fernando." 
</P>
<P>
A poll of the media covering Santa Anita selected John Henry, Laffit Pincay and 
Charlie Whittingham as the "best" in California thoroughbred racing through the 
just-concluded 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
John Henry, who was horse of the year in both 1981 and '84, received 17 of the 
20 votes cast. Alysheba, Spectacular Bid and Ferdinand received one apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Pincay, who is the world's second-winningest rider behind Bill Shoemaker, 
outpolled Chris McCarron and Eddie Delahoussaye. Whittingham and Wayne Lukas 
were the only trainers to be mentioned.

RAM NOTEBOOK;

IF GIANTS ARE LOOKING FOR HELP, THEY WON'T GET IT FROM MEDIA

If the Rams adhered to Buddy Ryan's pregame philosophy, they'd already be 
sinking their teeth into the New York Giants, this Sunday's NFC divisional 
playoff game opponent at the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Taylor? That wimp? The same All-Pro linebacker who was held to two 
excuse-me tackles and no sacks in the Rams' 31-10 thrashing of the Giants in 
November? What's this washout doing on a playoff team? 
</P>
<P>
No such bulletin-board luck for the Giants. The Rams know better, having just 
wiped a week's worth of juiced-up quotes in the face of Ryan's Philadelphia 
Eagles in the form of a 21-7 wild-card victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams will make it a point to low-key their approach against the Giants, 
despite having dominated the NFC East champions the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1988, quarterback Jim Everett tossed five touchdown passes in the 
Rams' 45-31 win over the Giants in the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
Last Nov. 12, at Anaheim Stadium, the Rams flattened the Giants, 31-10, in a 
game they led, 31-3, at one point in the fourth quarter. New York shared the 
NFC's best record entering the game at 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants have sacked Everett just once in the two meetings. Ram left tackle 
Irv Pankey seems to have what it takes to stop Taylor, who was invisible in the 
November game, drawing public address attention only for two penalties called 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams match up well against the Giants across the board. 
</P>
<P>
You could say the Rams had the Giants' number, but the Rams wouldn't dare. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had a chance to play them in the playoffs yet," Everett said. 
"There's no doubt we think they're a good football team. It'll probably be much 
different. They wouldn't have the record they have if they're not a good 
football team." 
</P>
<P>
What kind of game does tailback Greg Bell think it's going to be? Another rout 
like the previous two? Bite your tongue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a very physical game," Bell said. "We know each other, we've 
been fortunate to come out the victors the last two times we met. I know we're 
going to approach the game the same way we approached this one (against 
Philadelphia). It's going to be a dogfight and it's going to last until there's 
one second left on the clock. If we're in control of the ball, the last five 
minutes, we're going to run the clock out." 
</P>
<P>
Bad question/good answer: Everett, who has passed for 8,274 yards and 60 
touchdowns the past two seasons, was asked after Sunday's game if he felt he is 
starting to arrive as an NFL quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I arriving?" Everett responded. "I hate that question. You guys be the 
judge." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Everett feels that he hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I base my arriving on something that has to do with the (Super)Dome this 
year," he said. "My judgment of what a quarterback is, is one who wins the 
Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
After 14 seasons in the league, Ram offensive tackle Jackie Slater has seen it 
all. Oh, really? 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't gotten to the point where I think I know it all," he said. "All you 
have to do is go out to practice and have some of these youngsters beat you. 
It's a humbling enough experience. My position is one where you've constantly 
got to work to stay good at it, otherwise you get dominated." 
</P>
<P>
Slater proved again Sunday that he's still good enough. He limited Eagles' 
All-Pro defensive end Reggie White to one sack. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't getting any easier, though. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys like Reggie White and Bruce Smith keep popping up," he said. "They get 
bigger, faster and stronger. They're guys that can dominate. I hate to think 
how big and fast offensive and defensive linemen are eventually going to get." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's win over Philadelphia was the Rams' first playoff win since they 
defeated the Dallas Cowboys, 20-0, in a first-round divisional game in 1985. It 
was the team's first wild-card win since a victory over Dallas in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been awhile," Pankey said. "I think everybody believes. We've been 
through our four-week stretch where we lost games in the last 28 seconds. We've 
been to the down side." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' all-linebacker pass rush team of Kevin Greene, Brett Faryniarz, 
George Bethune and Fred Strickland averages 244 pounds per man if you believe 
the team's current weight listings. Don't believe them. The average is closer 
to 235 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Any more questions about the Rams being wimps in cold weather? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how many times you have to play in bad weather to become a 
bad-weather team," guard Tom Newberry said after consecutive wins at New 
England and Philadelphia, both games played in less-than-desirable conditions.

FIRST TROOPS PULLED OUT OF PANAMA; 
</P>
<P>
DEPLOYMENTS: 141 ARTILLERYMEN FROM FT. ORD ARE ON THEIR WAY HOME. BUSH SAYS 
THERE ARE NO NEW DEVELOPMENTS ON THE NORIEGA STANDOFF.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pentagon has begun withdrawing the U.S. invasion force from Panama, sending 
141 soldiers on their way home to Ft. Ord, Calif., the White House announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal, the first since President Bush launched an invasion of Panama 
in the early morning darkness of Dec. 20, was announced aboard Air Force One as 
the President flew from Montgomery, Ala., to Andrews Air Force Base outside 
Washington at the end of a New Year's holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"The President is glad to see some of the troops coming home and hopes the rest 
can leave as soon as possible," White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Bush made no public comments about the withdrawal, but the White House 
indicated that more troops are likely to return home within the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
The troops were among the units that overthrew the regime of Panamanian 
strongman Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
After eluding capture for 4 1/2 days, Noriega sought refuge on Christmas Eve in 
the Vatican's embassy in Panama City. Vatican, Panamanian and U.S. officials 
have been involved since then in negotiations in an effort to solve what Bush 
has called a "conundrum" over the former Panamanian leader's future. 
</P>
<P>
These talks, initially conducted through diplomatic channels in Washington, 
Panama City and the Vatican, intensified beginning Saturday, with 
representatives of all three parties reported to be holding sessions in Panama 
City in an effort to come to a solution. 
</P>
<P>
The United States wants to bring Noriega to trial in federal court in Florida 
on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering contained in indictments 
returned by grand juries in Miami and Tampa. Panama's attorney general has 
announced that he is preparing murder charges against Noriega in the killing of 
10 Panama Defense Forces officers involved in a failed attempt to topple the 
strongman last Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Asked on Monday whether there were any developments leading to a resolution of 
the Noriega question, Bush replied, "Nope." 
</P>
<P>
He has carefully sought to avoid any comment on the matter in recent days in an 
effort to avoid angering the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican traditionally grants sanctuary to persons fleeing religious or 
political persecution. But the United States maintains that Noriega is fleeing 
criminal indictments and is not entitled to political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
The first unit to be withdrawn is made up of 56 soldiers forming part of an 
artillery battery from Ft. Ord. The troops arrived at Kelly Air Force Base in 
San Antonio late Monday night and are scheduled to leave for Ft. Ord. early 
today, an Army spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon official said another plane carrying troops ultimately bound for Ft. 
Ord was due at Kelly but the timing was not immediately clear. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the first pullout was large enough to be considered a withdrawal, 
Fitzwater said: "You've got to start with one. We want them all to come out as 
soon as possible. Chances are they'll come out piecemeal like this." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, asked Sunday about how soon the troops would start coming home, gave no 
hint that a withdrawal was about to begin, saying only, "The sooner the 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking with reporters aboard the presidential jet, Fitzwater said on Monday 
that "we want them all to come out as soon as possible, except the 12,000 there 
permanently." 
</P>
<P>
Quarry Heights, Panama, is headquarters of the U.S. Southern Command, which has 
jurisdiction over all American military forces south of the U.S. frontier with 
Mexico. About 12,000 service people are permanently stationed at Quarry Heights 
and at other U.S.-operated bases extending along the Panama Canal. Their 
primary mission is the defense and protection of the canal under the Panama 
Canal Treaties of 1977. 
</P>
<P>
As it built up its forces for last month's invasion, the Pentagon dispatched an 
additional 12,000 troops and support personnel to Panama, and once the invasion 
was under way, up to 2,000 additional troops were sent there. The operational 
force encountered difficulties during the first days of the invasion in 
combatting civil disorders that followed the defeat of the Panama Defense 
Forces, up until then Panama's sole military, police and security force. 
Noriega was commander of the now-disbanded PDF. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is we'll see small groups like this coming out on a continuing basis 
from now on," Fitzwater said. "The chances are that they'll come out piecemeal 
like this because of varying duty assignments and mop-up details." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater's expectation was confirmed in Panama by an official of the Southern 
Command who said that an unidentified contingent with 15 vehicles will be 
leaving there today and that "additional redeployment" will take place over the 
next several days. 
</P>
<P>
Under standard military operating procedure, withdrawal of combat troops begins 
within weeks of a successful invasion, after initial objectives have been 
achieved. The remaining troops are assigned a mixture of duties, including 
taking over the operations of decimated military units in the invaded country. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Bush has encountered public demonstrations protesting the 
invasion and demanding that the troops be called home. 
</P>
<P>
He ran into such demonstrations over the weekend in Texas. These included 
protests that took place during a short trip made by the President between 
three military bases in San Antonio -- one of them Kelly Air Force Base -- 
during a morning he spent visiting with soldiers and Marines injured in the 
invasion and brought back to Texas for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, about three dozen protesters demanding a withdrawal from Panama 
greeted him Sunday afternoon in Houston outside the hotel where he maintains a 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
In visiting the wounded troops, Bush made a point of telling them: "The country 
. . . is behind what you did. (Although) every once in a while, somebody might 
take a shot at all of us." 
</P>

THE 1990 TOURNAMENT OF ROSES PARADE; 
</P>
<P>
TV REVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
VIEW FROM THE COUCH: CHANNEL-BY-CHANNEL RATING OF PARADE COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Tournament of Roses didn't go unnoticed Monday -- by Channel 2 or 4 or 5 or 
7 or 11. It was a giant talk-off. 
</P>
<P>
If you were flipping to one of these stations and you stumbled across Channel 
13, you saw people scurrying through city streets. They weren't running to 
watch the parade; they were panicked, fleeing Godzilla. 
</P>
<P>
KCOP, declaring itself neutral in the war of the words, counterprogrammed with 
a likeness of a Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtle hosting a Godzilla marathon of 
English-dubbed Japanese movies. 
</P>
<P>
Zillions watched the parade from curbside in Pasadena -- which is what parade 
watching is about. You can't get the crack and thunder of a marching band or 
the majesty of a giant float through a living-room TV screen. 
</P>
<P>
But the home coverage still reflects, year after year, the marvel of it all. 
Just beware of the banter. 
</P>
<P>
Coverage began with pre-parade trivia and preparatory superlatives at 7 a.m. 
with the most aggressive of the hostiles, KTLA (5) and KTTV (11). In their ads, 
both promised the best camera locations, the best commentators, the best stereo 
sound. And both would keep their cameras on the parade without departing for 
commercials. (Plugs for the sponsors were laid over the parade images.) 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to assess bests. The commentators all work from the basic facts and 
factoids assembled by the parade producers. 
</P>
<P>
But certain truths emerge from watching the swirl of coverage. One is that for 
such occasions, you need professionals. Professionals in the art of banter. 
</P>
<P>
NBC (KNBC, Channel 4) assigned commentating duty to actors Blair Underwood and 
Barbara Eden, who were about as compatible as oil and water. He was mostly 
uncomfortable; her contribution was mostly "oh wow," "oooh," "wooo" and "oh my 
heavens!" 
</P>
<P>
She also did her Zsa Zsa Gabor impression as the real Zsa Zsa bounced by on a 
Tennessee Walker. 
</P>
<P>
On CBS (KCBS, Channel 2), actor-hosts Kevin Dobson and Mary Frann were out of 
sync. She particularly seemed out of character waxing philosophical about the 
state of the world and invoking Albert Schweitzer quotations about how people 
can only be truly happy helping others. On ABC (KABC, Channel 7), Joan Lunden 
and Jim McKay, who have careers in banter, were generally the least silly and 
had the best sense for reporting the parade. Their program included some snappy 
interviews with just-folks along the parade route and a few features like one 
from inside the Baskin-Robbins float -- mother cow and wobbly calf -- that said 
more about the magnificence of these floats than anything else presented the 
whole day. 
</P>
<P>
ABC also seemed to be the only station to report that police carted some 
protesters away from the parade. Others instead flipped to footage of smiling 
Grand Marshal John Glenn, the former-astronaut-turned-senator who probably was 
happy that the protest had nothing to do with the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
On KTLA, Stephanie Edwards and Bob Eubanks are vets of such events, and their 
asides were sensibly chosen. Eubanks did soften his usual raucousness. He, of 
course, is snared in a controversy about a tasteless AIDS-Jewish women joke 
that he cracked for the cameras and that now is being shown in the current 
docucomedy film "Roger and Me." 
</P>
<P>
Rival KTTV employed a panel of three for its color -- actress Deidre Hall, 
"Jeopardy" host Alex Trebek and veteran reporter Bill Welsh, who figures this 
was his 43rd straight Rose Parade. 
</P>
<P>
KTLA and KTTV distinctly had the best camera spots, as both had promised, and 
some of their close-ups brought nice dimension to the parade. But it was a 
tossup, although KTTV's coverage ran one minute longer than KTLA's. 
</P>
<P>
And in a coverage overwrought with platitudes and superlatives, Trebek spoke 
the final cliche of the day: "A good time was had by all." 
</P>
<P>
A good time also was had by all on Channel 13. Earth was saved once more, just 
at the last moment, and that always makes for a good day. 
</P>
<P>
Now, on with the football. . . .

100 SOVIET JEWS ARRIVE IN ISRAEL ON DIRECT EL AL FLIGHT FROM MOSCOW

<P>
More than 100 Soviet Jews arrived in Israel on Monday from Moscow on an 
unprecedented direct chartered flight by the Israeli national airline El Al. 
</P>
<P>
Among those greeting the immigrants at Ben-Gurion International Airport near 
Tel Aviv was Uri Gordon, head of the immigration and absorption department in 
the Jewish Agency, which helps resettle newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very moving, a historic moment," Gordon said. "One can see on their 
faces what it means to them to come to the Jewish state." 
</P>
<P>
Sources in Israel's Transport Ministry and El Al expressed hope that the flight 
will increase the chances of an agreement to allow regular flights between the 
two countries, the Israeli daily Haaretz reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union broke ties with Israel after the 1967 Israeli-Arab War, but 
relations have warmed in the past two years with an exchange of consular 
missions and dozens of cultural activities. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, about 12,000 Soviet Jews emigrated to Israel. This is the highest 
number of immigrants to arrive in Israel from the Soviet Union since the 1970s, 
Israel Radio reported. In December alone, 3,500 out of the 8,500 Jews who left 
the Soviet Union came to settle in Israel, the radio reported.

Efforts to find a compromise that would keep Israel's divided government intact 
were deadlocked Monday, and officials close to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir 
said that he is determined to assert his authority over dovish ministers in the 
teetering coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister is standing firm," said Yosef Ben-Aharon, a top aide to 
Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir, who heads the rightist Likud Party, fired Science Minister Ezer 
Weizman, from the center-left Labor Party, for making direct and indirect 
contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization and discussing peace 
proposals with the group. The Sunday dismissal set off the government crisis. 
</P>
<P>
However, there were wire service reports early today that President Chaim 
Herzog had stepped into the crisis and suggested a compromise that might defuse 
the issue. They quoted Israel Television as saying that, in a private meeting 
with Shamir, Herzog said the crisis calls for a "proper legal inquiry" and that 
Weizeman should be allowed to keep his Cabinet post until the inquiry is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
Labor wants Weizman reinstated. Both parties were busily courting minor 
political groups in order to build a narrow coalition should the coalition 
shatter. But Labor, the junior partner in the national unity government, is 
also looking for a compromise. Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Labor said he 
views "the continuation of the national unity government as the need of the 
hour." 
</P>
<P>
However, Israel Television said that Shimon Peres, vice prime minister and 
Labor Party leader, quickly rejected the Herzog proposal, saying the damage had 
already been done. 
</P>
<P>
One solution under discussion is to remove Weizman from the policy-making Inner 
Cabinet, which is made up of six members each from Labor and Likud. Yitzhak 
Peretz, leader of the small, religious Shas party who is trying to mediate a 
compromise, reported no headway Monday. "It is hard to say I see a way out," 
Peretz said. 
</P>
<P>
Under government rules, the dismissal of Weizman, a flamboyant former fighter 
pilot and defense minister, is set to become final today. A vote of confidence 
in the government has been scheduled later in the week -- not because of 
Weizman and the PLO but because religious parties object to government 
authorization of a protest rally last week on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
He's Sending Messages 
</P>
<P>
Likud officials said that, by firing Weizman, the prime minister is sending out 
a variety of messages, not only to political rivals at home but to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
First, he is trying to re-establish his own authority, which he saw as being 
eroded by Weizman's contacts with the PLO, government spokesman Yosef Olmert 
said. The Labor Party, led by Finance Minister Shimon Peres, has been trying to 
pull Shamir toward compromise on the issue of giving up the occupied West Bank 
and Gaza Strip in return for peace with rebellious Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
"Shamir is saying, 'I'm the boss,' in case anyone forgot," Olmert declared. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir was also shoring up his hold on the Likud, where he was under attack for 
being soft on talks with the PLO, Olmert added. 
</P>
<P>
The message for Washington arises from Shamir's perception that the Bush 
Administration intends to try to corner him into talks with the PLO. Shamir 
opposes PLO participation in peace talks because he views the group's demand 
for an independent Palestinian state as a means of setting up a hostile base 
next door to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"If people in Washington think the prime minister wants a fig leaf to talk with 
the PLO, I can say that this prime minister does not play with fig leaves," 
Olmert said. 
</P>
<P>
Israel is engaged in laborious talks with the Bush Administration over plans to 
negotiate with a Palestinian peace delegation. The PLO has been responding to 
the American overtures for talks through Egyptian mediation. Under a plan 
authored by Secretary of State James A. Baker III, the United States, Egypt and 
Israel have agreed to meet in the coming weeks to discuss the formation of a 
Palestinian negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
Weizman expressed pleasure at being the center of a political storm. On Israel 
Radio, he stated flatly that he hopes the coalition will fall over his ouster. 
Weizman is a proponent of Israeli-PLO talks. 
</P>
<P>
Weizman was a key participant in the crafting of the 1979 Camp David peace 
treaty between Israel and Egypt. The experience converted him from a hawk -- he 
belonged to the Likud at the time -- to a dove. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of Weizman's PLO connection center on an Israeli Arab physician named 
Ahmed Tibi, whose name had surfaced publicly in efforts to contact the PLO over 
missing Israeli prisoners in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Weizman told a Labor Party caucus Monday that not long ago he received a phone 
call from Tibi who was visiting Tunis, the headquarters of the PLO. Tibi asked 
him if the PLO should accept the Baker plan for peace talks. Weizman put Tibi 
on hold and phoned an unnamed Israeli official. 
</P>
<P>
He went back to Tibi and advised the PLO to accept U.S. plans to hold talks and 
if it had reservations, to put them in the form of conditions that could then 
be negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO has accepted Baker's plan in principle but is demanding that it select 
the Palestinian panel. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir learned of Weizman's activities from the Shin Bet, Israel's domestic 
intelligence service, officials in the prime minister's office said. It was not 
clear whether the agency was spying on Weizman -- that would require 
authorization from Shamir himself.

LEBANON: PRO-IRANIAN HEZBOLLAH TRIES TO KEEP IT QUIET BUT NIGHT SPOTS ARE HOT

<P>
With only hours to go before Lebanon left the tragic 1980s and headed for a new 
decade, Beirutis on both sides of the Green Line rushed about gathering the 
ingredients for Ras-issini, Arabic for New Year's. Shops opened Sunday, 
allowing residents to buy everything from sequin gowns to Seagram's gin and 
smoked salmon. 
</P>
<P>
Since the deployment of Syrian troops in Muslim West Beirut in February, 1987, 
the influence of Hezbollah -- the fundamentalist, pro-Iranian "Party of God" -- 
over West Beirut night life and the beverages usually associated with it has 
been restricted to the areas it controls in Beirut's predominantly Shiite 
Muslim southern suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
El Mustapha supermarket, located in one of those suburbs, was well-stocked with 
party hats, noisemakers and balloons. There were even a few artificial 
Christmas trees left and a handful of Christmas cards as well. The supermarket 
also sells non-alcoholic beer which, like the cards, comes from Iran. 
</P>
<P>
But early Sunday morning, members of Hezbollah put a damper on partying. 
Touring areas under its control with loudspeakers, it warned residents that 
after 9 p.m. New Year's Eve, no one would be allowed into the area for the rest 
of the night. And those leaving the area could not return before 7 a.m. Monday. 
One resident reckoned that this move was an attempt to keep people from 
bringing in alcoholic beverages from other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Another resident admitted that he already had his whiskey hidden away but that 
he would celebrate at home watching television. Even that was difficult as 
electricity rationing left most of the city dark. 
</P>
<P>
Using a home generator could have been the answer, but "Hezbollah Ordinance II" 
ordered that no generator noise would be allowed after 10 p.m. The noise, the 
militiamen said, would interfere with the call to evening prayers. 
</P>
<P>
Even battery-run boom boxes were included in the noise ordinance. Hezbollah 
warned that loud music would not be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, just minutes away from the southern suburbs are two of West 
Beirut's hottest night spots -- Summerland and the Coral Beach night club. 
Dinner, dancing and drinks cost a couple nearly $200 there. Hezbollah holds no 
sway in that area because the Syrian headquarters are just down the street. 
</P>
<P>
The Syrian presence in West Beirut has made merrymaking safe and profitable for 
merchants who once took a dangerous risk to openly sell alcohol. On the other 
hand, staying on good terms with the Syrians requires diplomacy and occasional 
seasonal largess. It is, in other words, the merchants duty to provide free 
shopping from time to time to Syrian soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
For a Good Time . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to have a good time tonight (New Year's Eve)," said a traveler to 
his American seatmate as they landed at Beirut airport, "go to East Beirut. 
That's were the action is." 
</P>
<P>
Christian East Beirut's posh restaurants such as Don Carlos offered a gala 
dinner, free-flowing drinks, party hats and an orchestra to set the mood, all 
for $130 a couple. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lebanon has the reputation of being war-torn and poor, New Year's Eve 
is no time to search for evidence to prove it on either side of the Green Line, 
which separates mainly Muslim West Beirut from Christian-dominated East Beirut. 
Jimmy's Disco in West Beirut had entertainment as well as dinner and drinks for 
$300 a couple. "Down and Out in Beirut" wouldn't make such a bad movie title, 
when one comes to think about it. 
</P>
<P>
In East Beirut, the striking of the clock at midnight gave way to an odd scene. 
Lebanese Forces militiamen, standing on apartment balconies and back-lit by 
Christmas trees, fired thousands of tracer bullets from their M-16s. 
</P>
<P>
In the western sector, the Syrians followed suit, and militias on the Green 
Line joined the fun as their streams of tracers crisscrossed a sky already lit 
up by flashes of lightning. 
</P>
<P>
On the official government level, New Year's activities began and ended with 
Lebanon's new president giving a five-minute, year-end message, promising the 
Lebanese "a strong and capable state" in 1990. Using the slogan "Reconciliation 
is the path to reforms," President Elias Hrawi aimed his comments at Lebanon's 
rebellious army commander, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, who has refused to vacate 
Baabda Palace, the Lebanese White House. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun does not recognize Hrawi as president, accusing him of being a Syrian 
stooge. Aoun's demand for a complete Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon is what was 
behind the six months of intense fighting that claimed more than 900 lives 
between March and September. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how noisy it was New Year's Eve, it wasn't anything like the hours of 
crashing shells and rocket exchanges that characterized "night life" in Beirut 
last spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Aoun's supporters held a bash outside Baabda Palace on Sunday 
night, bringing their own food and drink. Dubbed the most popular (and 
cheapest) hangout in East Beirut, the palace grounds swarmed with merrymakers 
in spite of rain.

Israel on Monday imposed an indefinite curfew on 650,000 Arabs in the Gaza 
Strip, reinforcing troops there and in the West Bank to prevent demonstrations, 
the army said. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leaders of a two-year revolt against Israeli rule in the occupied 
territories had called for celebrations Monday commemorating the founding in 
1965 of Fatah, the mainstream Palestine Liberation Organization group headed by 
Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
Journalists are barred from the Gaza Strip unless accompanied by an army 
escort, an army spokesman said.

<P>
The army also imposed curfews Sunday on the Hebron market and Ramallah in the

ROMANIA: THE NEW GOVERNMENT ALSO DOES AWAY WITH THE DEATH PENALTY AND SHORTENS 
THE WORKWEEK TO FIVE DAYS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The new Romanian government announced Monday that it has abolished the death 
penalty, disbanded Nicolae Ceausescu's hated secret police, the Securitate, and 
will introduce a five-day workweek. 
</P>
<P>
A week after Ceausescu, 71, and his wife, Elena, were executed by a military 
firing squad, the revocation of the death penalty and other steps were made 
public by interim President Ion Iliescu in a New Year's television address. 
</P>
<P>
"The two executions will be the last to be carried out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The interim president's speech was part of an energetic campaign by the new 
government to win the trust of 23 million Romanians who lived for the last 24 
years under one of the world's most oppressive Communist regimes. 
</P>
<P>
"No attempt by the remains of the old regime is capable of turning back the 
wheel of history again," Iliescu said. "The process that has occurred is 
irreversible. The popular revolution has triumphed, and it will remain 
unvanquishable." 
</P>
<P>
He announced a decree abolishing the Securitate, the vast secret police 
organization that was a pervasive presence in Romanian society. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to members of the Securitate who have not yet surrendered, he said 
that "all further terrorists will be prosecuted according to the valid laws of 
the land." 
</P>
<P>
Iliescu said the five-day workweek will be introduced in March. A six-day week 
had been customary. 
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the government is abandoning a principle of the 
Ceausescu regime that considered all land the property of the state. 
Henceforth, he said, homeowners can consider the land that their houses stand 
on as their own. Farmers, he said, will be allowed to buy land adjoining their 
houses and will be able to farm privately and sell their produce on the free 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Romanians who were forced to relocate to cities and towns under Ceausescu's 
scheme to move farmers off land will be allowed to move back and will be 
alloted six-tenths of an acre of land, "providing they commit themselves to pay 
taxes and cultivate the land well." 
</P>
<P>
In moves to build public confidence, leading figures in the interim government 
began appearing in television interviews Sunday to explain their past 
connections with the Communist Party, run with an iron hand by Ceausescu and 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling National Salvation Front council decided to tackle head-on the 
complaints voiced by some Romanians that too many Communists have been included 
in the new government, which will run the country until free elections are held 
in April. 
</P>
<P>
Silviu Brucan, a 73-year-old former diplomat and possibly the most widely 
respected member of the 11-member council at the head of the National Salvation 
Front, appeared on television Sunday night in an hourlong interview. He 
explained that he and others on the council had constituted virtually the only 
opposition to the Ceausescu regime in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Brucan was placed under house arrest in 1987 for protesting in an open letter 
to Ceausescu that Romanians were sufferring under the Draconian austerity 
program he imposed on the country. The letter charged that the people were 
faced with starvation and were "freezing in their own houses." 
</P>
<P>
Brucan said that in the future, "there can be no 'isms' in Romania." 
</P>
<P>
"We are not Communists," Brucan said. "We are not anything. Theory has been 
destroyed in this country." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview earlier in the day, Brucan indicated that the National 
Salvation Front decided to move quickly to counter any suggestion that its 
leading members had been sympathetic in any way to the Ceausescu regime. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a matter of establishing our credentials," Brucan said. "It is an 
overriding consideration. People must know what we did." 
</P>
<P>
In the coming days, he said, Petre Roman, the interim prime minister, and 
interim President Iliescu will make similar television appearances. 
</P>
<P>
National Salvation Front sources said Sunday that, in effect, they are in the 
initial stages of what will likely become their campaign for the April 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
So far, six organizations have announced they intend to form political parties 
with a view to competing in the elections. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the National Peasants Party, after a meeting with Dumitru 
Mazilu, a vice president of the council, said they were assured that the 
National Salvation Front is committed to free and fair elections.

NEW CZECH LEADER ORDERS AMNESTY FOR UP TO 30,000

<P>
Newly installed President Vaclav Havel, a playwright who spent five years in 
jail as a dissident, announced a nationwide amnesty Monday that could cover up 
to 30,000 prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
In an announcement read on television, he said he will free all prisoners 
facing or serving sentences of up to two years for crimes committed 
deliberately, and also prisoners with terms of three years for crimes committed 
out of negligence. 
</P>
<P>
Those with longer sentences would have up to half remitted. 
</P>
<P>
The amnesty does not cover people charged with abuse of public position, 
including former Communist officials, and with a number of criminal offenses 
such as murder, armed robbery and rape. 
</P>
<P>
Petr Uhl, a member of a government committee set up to investigate prison 
conditions, estimated that about 40,000 people are imprisoned in 
Czechoslovakia. He said that up to three-quarters of them apparently would be 
eligible for amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of political prisoners have already been released under an amnesty 
granted by former President Gustav Husak. He acted last year after huge 
pro-democracy protests and the fall of Communist hard-liners. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, who took office last week, was jailed for his dissident activities by 
the former government. 
</P>
<P>
In a New Year's message before the amnesty announcement, Havel pledged to lift 
his country from a mire of political hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing is that we live in a contaminated moral environment . . . 
because we became used to saying something different from what we thought," 
Havel declared. He called on Czechoslovakia to rediscover its self-confidence 
and help Europe restore the concept of morality in politics.

Bus fares and gasoline doubled in price and electricity quadrupled Monday under 
a radical plan by the non-Communist government to transform Poland's centrally 
planned economy to capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
The price of coal, a major source of heat in Polish homes, officially increased 
by 600%, the cost of electricity by 400% and the price of heating gas by 400%. 
</P>
<P>
Rail and intercity bus passengers found that ticket prices had gone up an 
average of 250%, while the price of municipal bus tickets doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Most gasoline stations were shut for the New Year's holiday. However, those 
open were selling regular gasoline for 2,400 zlotys per liter, up from 1,200 
zlotys. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz acknowledged that there will be hardships 
in the coming months. However, he stressed that the increases are needed to 
halt Poland's 900% annual inflation and to end the nation's economic decline. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no solutions devoid of risk," the official news agency PAP quoted 
him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The far-reaching plan is intended to supplant the centrally directed economy 
run by the Communists during their four-decade rule. But there is concern that 
the economic shock will be too much for Poles, who earn an average monthly wage 
of 350,000 zlotys ($37).

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev continued a New Year's tradition and 
wished the American people a happy new year and said the 1990s will be "a 
decade of the drawing of the United States and the Soviet Union closer 
together." 
</P>
<P>
In a companion message broadcast on Soviet television, President Bush praised 
Gorbachev as "a good partner in peace" and invited the people of the Soviet 
Union today to "look forward to a new century, and a new millennium, of peace, 
freedom and prosperity." 
</P>
<P>
The messages continued an exchange begun by Gorbachev and former President 
Reagan in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's video message said, "The year 1990 can and must bring nearer a 
genuinely peaceful period of world history. There are still hesitations, 
wait-and-see attitudes, doubts and suspicions. But all this only reaffirms the 
crucial nature of the current situation." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev called for making the 1990s "a decade of the drawing of the United 
States and the Soviet Union closer together on the basis of universal human 
values and the balance of interests. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"The entire world proceeds ahead. It wants happiness, freedom and prosperity. 
And it would be naive, senseless and dangerous to try to thwart this aspiration 
for a better future. 
</P>
<P>
"During the Malta meeting, President Bush and I agreed that it was essential to 
get away from the Cold War and to abandon the Cold War instruments as well, so 
that 1990 and subsequent years could open up a period of genuine cooperation 
before us." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev concluded by saying, "I wholeheartedly wish all Americans a happy new 
year."

29 DIE IN TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS OVER HOLIDAY; DRUNK DRIVER ARRESTS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
During what traffic officials refer to as the "deadliest season of the year," 
29 people died on California roads as the New Year's weekend drew to a close. 
</P>
<P>
Though the number was down from 33 deaths during the same period last year, 
drunk driving arrests went up, California Highway Patrol Sgt. Mike Brey said. 
</P>
<P>
From 6 p.m. Friday, when the holiday reporting period began, to 6 a.m. Monday, 
2,156 people were arrested, compared with 1,725 last year, the Highway Patrol 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were hesitant to say if a new law that went into effect on New 
Year's Day, lowering the blood alcohol content standard for legal drunkenness 
from .10 to .08, led to the increase in the number of people arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"We may make more arrests but that is not the point," Brey said. "It won't be 
the number of arrests that will change attitudes about drinking and driving. 
That will come when the public understands the position law enforcement has 
taken -- that you don't have to be falling down drunk for your driving to be 
impaired. If you exhibit symptoms of intoxication, regardless of whether you 
are over the legal limit or not, you can still be arrested and booked for DUI." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, police said they arrested 188 drivers, 128 of them on New 
Year's Eve. The total was about the same as last year, police said.

USC BEATS BO IN HIS LAST ROSE BOWL, 17-10 
</P>

Ricky Ervins scored on a 14-yard run with 1:10 to play, lifting 12th-ranked USC 
to a 17-10 victory over third-ranked Michigan in the Rose Bowl game at Pasadena 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Schembechler, in his last game as Michigan's coach, closed his career with a 
2-8 record in Rose Bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans finished the season 9-2-1; Michigan is 10-2. 
</P>
<P>
In Monday's other bowl games: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Peter Tom Willis threw for 422 yards and five touchdowns, both Fiesta Bowl 
records, as fifth-ranked Florida State routed No. 6 Nebraska 41-17 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The victory capped a 10-2 season for Florida State, which won its final 10 
games. Nebraska also finished at 10-2. 
</P>
<P>
It was the worst overall loss for Nebraska since Oklahoma beat the Cornhuskers 
38-7 in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chuck Webb ran for 250 yards, the second-best rushing performance in Cotton 
Bowl history, as eighth-ranked Tennessee beat 10th-ranked Arkansas, 31-27, at 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Webb, a freshman, carried 26 times and scored twice, including a 78-yard run. 
Rice's Dicky Maegle set the Cotton Bowl record of 265 yards against Alabama in 
1954. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee finished with an 11-1 record; Arkansas is 10-2. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reggie Slack completed his last 12 passes before halftime and led 
ninth-ranked Auburn to a 31-14 victory over 21st-ranked Ohio State in the Hall 
of Fame Bowl at Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
After suffering two interceptions, Slack threw touchdown passes of 11 and 4 
yards to Greg Taylor that gave the Tigers the lead for good. Greg Frey, 
quarterback for Ohio State, was sacked four times. Auburn finished at 10-2, 
Ohio State at 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the Citrus Bowl at Orlando, Fla., Jeff George passed for a season-high 
321 yards and three touchdowns as 11th-ranked Illinois defeated 15th-ranked 
Virginia, 31-21. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first bowl game victory for the Illini (11-2) since their 17-7 win 
over Washington in the 1964 Rose Bowl. The Cavaliers finished at 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
The final rankings in the Associated Press poll will be released today.

COCAINE DEATH SQUAD CHIEF SEIZED, POLICE SAY

<TEXT>
<P>
The chief of the death squads organized by the Medellin cocaine cartel was 
arrested at a police roadblock in central Colombia, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest drug-trafficking suspect to be arrested was Jose Manuel Cruz 
Aguirre, who is wanted in Peru, the Administrative Security Police said in a 
communique Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz Aguirre was arrested Friday evening on a highway about 35 miles south of 
Bogota, the security police said. There were no immediate details on what 
charges he faces. 
</P>
<P>
Death squads financed by drug traffickers have killed scores of peasants 
suspected of sympathizing with leftist guerrillas, who have tried to extort 
money from cattle ranchers in areas where traffickers hold property. 
</P>
<P>
The squads also have killed about 740 members of the country's biggest leftist 
political party, the Patriotic Union, presumably because the party has the 
support of the country's estimated 10,000 guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz Aguirre was part owner of one of Colombia's professional soccer teams, 
Deportes Tolima, the security police said. Colombian authorities have contended 
for years that drug bosses are among the owners of several professional soccer 
teams in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre was the third purported member of the Medellin cartel arrested in four 
days. The others were Jose Antonio Ocampo Obando and Camilo Antonio Ruiz Vega. 
</P>
<P>
Ocampo Obando, arrested Friday, is wanted for extradition by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz Vega, arrested Thursday, was a top confidant of Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, 
the No. 2 man killed by police Dec. 15.

A suspected drunk driver was shot to death in his driveway by California 
Highway Patrol officers when he fired an assault rifle at them, officials said. 
Officers Brian Smith and Tom Sayles tried to stop Mark Ivey, 28, as he drove 
eastbound on Casa Loma Drive about 1:15 a.m., CHP dispatcher Linda Stevens 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ivey did not stop his pickup truck, so the officers pursued him until he 
stopped in his driveway in the Rexland Acres area, Stevens said. As Officers 
Ken Perez and Victor Lacey arrived to join Smith and Sayles, Ivey pulled out an 
assault rifle resembling an Uzi and fired at least one round at the officers, 
Stevens said. All four of the officers returned fire.

State transportation officials have warned riders of San Francisco Bay ferries 
that they must continue to use the service if they hope to win the battle for 
extended service between San Francisco and the East Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of dollars will be needed to save the service that began in the 
transportation crisis that followed the Oct. 17 earthquake, officials said. The 
state Department of Transportation has warned ferry riders that subsidies will 
run out March 23. Although exact figures are not available, officials estimate 
that 3,000 riders use the ferries daily, compared to 15,000 passengers daily 
when the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge was closed after the quake.

TELEVISION / LARRY STEWART: BOWL GAME LINEUP: TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, there is such a thing as too much football. 
</P>
<P>
Seven bowl games on New Year's Day is about four too many. 
</P>
<P>
While the NFL presents a nice, neat postseason tournament, what the colleges 
present is a mess. 
</P>
<P>
Try watching seven games within an 11-hour span. It's enough to make your head 
spin worse than any New Year's Day hangover. 
</P>
<P>
The first game Monday was the Hall of Fame Bowl game. NBC had to cut away from 
its coverage of the Rose Parade, but at least it didn't run into the 
overlapping problems that ABC did. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Fame Bowl game ended, NBC wasted little time switching to the 
Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
It was nice and clean, far better than ABC's switch from the Florida Citrus 
Bowl game to the Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
ABC took its time making the switch. ABC started off by showing a promotional 
spot for the upcoming Rose Bowl game. Thanks, but we knew it was coming. 
</P>
<P>
Then came a promo for ABC Sports, then a 'thank-you" promo to an airline that 
provides it with free travel. Then there were two promos for ABC shows, 
followed by a news brief. 
</P>
<P>
What next? Three consecutive commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, an introduction for the Rose Bowl game, followed by a taped interview 
with Bo Schembechler. 
</P>
<P>
Then came more ABC Sports graphics and two more commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, by the way, the Cotton Bowl on CBS was still going on. Arkansas scored on a 
long pass play and after a failed two-point conversion attempt, the Razorbacks 
trailed Tennessee, 31-27, with 1:29 left. 
</P>
<P>
OK, we were finally going to see the Rose Bowl game kickoff, right? Nah. 
</P>
<P>
First there was a Big Ten promo, more ABC graphics and then finally a glimpse 
of the Rose Bowl, where the crowd was finishing singing the National Anthem. 
</P>
<P>
Then came an introduction from announcer Keith Jackson, and another taped piece 
on Schembechler, this one showing a 1971 pep talk. 
</P>
<P>
Next was another commercial, then a Pacific 10 promo followed by one more 
commercial. 
</P>
<P>
The teams finally took the field, and Jackson and commentator Bob Griese then 
offered a little pregame analysis, as if there already hadn't been enough. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Fiesta Bowl game, Florida State missed a field-goal attempt 
and trailed Nebraska, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Rose Bowl game kickoff came, 18 minutes after the end of the 
Citrus Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
One play after the kickoff at the Rose Bowl game, Florida State recovered a 
fumble to set up its first touchdown to tie the score on the way to a rout of 
the Cornhuskers. 
</P>
<P>
At least we were down to only two games, the Cotton Bowl game having ended. 
</P>
<P>
It was quite a task trying to watch the Hall of Fame, the Citrus and the Cotton 
Bowl games all at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The Cotton Bowl game was the last of the three early games to start. 
</P>
<P>
The Citrus Bowl game began shortly after ABC went from Pasadena to Orlando, 
Fla.But it didn't take long to realize there was going to be a time squeeze 
later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly Citrus Bowl game announcer Gary Bender sensed it. As officials 
discussed a first-quarter penalty, Bender said: "Come on, fellas, we've got a 
lot of football to play today." 
</P>
<P>
If you happened to be watching the Hall of Fame Bowl game you saw Ohio State's 
Zack Dumas level Auburn's Stacy Danley. 
</P>
<P>
Announcer Don Criqui first said: "That's got to be the hardest hit of the 
'89-90 bowl season." 
</P>
<P>
Then, after viewing a replay, Criqui said: "It's the hardest hit I've seen in 
football in years." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed it was. 
</P>
<P>
A little later in the game, Criqui, talking about Auburn's Shayne Wasden's punt 
returns of 30 and 34 yards, said they broke the Orange Bowl game record. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe you can't blame Criqui for being confused. He worked the last eight 
Orange Bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of flubs, O.J. Simpson, during halftime of the Hall of Fame Bowl game, 
referred to Notre Dame's George Gipp as George Kemp, or something like that. 
However, Simpson did catch the mistake and corrected himself. 
</P>
<P>
In referring to Gipp's death, comparing it to the death of Colorado quarterback 
Sal Aunese, Simpson said it occurred a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
NBC colleague Bob Costas, fearing Simpson's attempt at sarcasm was probably 
lost on most viewers, added: "It was more than a few years ago. It was so long 
ago that a young Ronald Reagan could play Gipp (in the 1940 movie, 'The Knute 
Rockne All-American')." 
</P>
<P>
During halftime of the Hall of Fame Bowl game, Gayle Gardner -- yes, she still 
works for NBC -- did a nice taped interview with Miami Coach Dennis Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
And Gardner, during halftime of the Fiesta Bowl game, offered an excellent 
feature on the once-troubled Colorado football program and the death of Aunese 
this past September. 
</P>
<P>
CBS, meanwhile, deserves kudos for a halftime segment it showed during the 
Cotton Bowl. It chronicled the highlights of college football during the 1980s, 
including California's 1982 kickoff return against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
NBC broke a story that Notre Dame defensive coordinator Barry Alvarez would 
become coach at Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
The network had Ralph Wiley interview Alvarez later in the day, but because of 
technical problems, had to cut away from it earlier than planned. 
</P>
<P>
On this long day and night of football, the overall coverage and the announcing 
was fine. 
</P>
<P>
But something needs to be done about the logjam. The way things are now, it's 
impossible to see everything. 
</P>
<P>
Just trying is a real job -- and no fun.

TV GAME SHOW PILOTS FIGHTING FOR AIR TIME; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: WITH A HUGE POTENTIAL PAYOFF AT STAKE, PRODUCERS OF PROGRAMS FOR 
SYNDICATION HOPE TO SPELL TROUBLE FOR 'WHEEL OF FORTUNE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KAYE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A videotape is popped into a machine and Merv Griffin appears, eager to tell 
everyone about "the biggest project I've ever worked on." Best known today for 
his involvement with hotels and TV programs, Griffin is now out pushing an 
enterprise that combines elements of both: "Monopoly," a syndicated game show. 
</P>
<P>
After Griffin's brief spiel on the tape -- "Peter Tomarken is a wonnnnderful 
host" -- the pilot for the program runs. Salespeople representing Griffin and 
King World, which will distribute the show, are blanketing the country, playing 
the cassette for TV station executives who might buy "Monopoly." 
</P>
<P>
Griffin and King World already produce and distribute the nation's top two 
syndicated shows, "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" If they can sell their 
video version of the classic board game to enough stations to make it worth 
producing, they stand to make millions. 
</P>
<P>
But it won't be easy. The offices of TV station executives are thick with 
salespeople these days. This is selling season for the syndicated television 
industry, a period that will culminate with frenzied deal-making this month at 
the National Assn. of Television Program Executives convention in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of syndicated offerings are vying for attention in categories ranging 
from talk shows ("Voices of America With Jesse Jackson"), to series ("The New 
Dragnet") to network reruns ("Head of the Class") to the offbeat ("TV 
Personals"). Nowhere does the competition appear steeper than in game shows, 
however. The bright lights, bells, buzzers and toothsome hosts belie the 
cutthroat nature of the business. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting for syndicated slots this round -- the programmers' convention will be 
the Bonus Round -- are "Monopoly"; "Trump Card" from Warner Bros.; "The 
Challengers" from Dick Clark Productions and Buena Vista Television; "Quiz Kids 
Challenge" from Guber-Peters; and remakes of "Tic Tac Dough" from ITC, "The 
Joker's Wild" from Orbis Communications and "Name That Tune" from Orion. 
</P>
<P>
Out of those game shows, which are considered to be the major contenders for 
success, and the countless lesser hopefuls, only two, maybe three will make it 
into production, say industry experts. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that there are few time slots available for new syndicated 
shows. Besides "Wheel" and "Jeopardy!," which each appear on more than 200 
stations across the country, valuable time slots already are taken by other 
types of syndicated programs. "Oprah Winfrey," "Entertainment Tonight" and "A 
Current Affair" are still going strong. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the potential payoff is great enough that for many production 
companies it is worth the expense of taping a pilot and unleashing a sales 
team. Most game-show producers sell their programs through "cash plus barter." 
That means they not only get paid by the stations buying the show, but they 
keep the rights to some of the available commercial time, which they sell 
themselves. If they syndicate their program to enough stations -- 70% of the 
country is generally considered the minimum -- the producers can sell lucrative 
national advertising spots. 
</P>
<P>
Game-show sales may also get a boost this year from an advertiser backlash 
against trashy programs. "There's advertiser resistance to titillating talk 
shows and magazine shows of a tabloid nature," says Jon Gluck, vice president 
of programming for MMT Sales Inc., which advises stations. National advertisers 
are growing concerned about advertising on "the 'Geraldos,' the 'Hard Copies,' 
the 'Current Affairs' and even the 'Oprahs' and 'Donahues,' " he said. Games 
shows, says Gluck, offer "a very healthy advertising environment." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the lure of cash and lovely prizes that await successful 
game-show producers, this year's contestants smell an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a feeling that the time is right to challenge 'Wheel,' " says Gluck. 
Although it remains a strong No. 1, Vanna White's show is slipping in the 
ratings and competitors are anxiously awaiting the day the wheel stops 
spinning. 
</P>
<P>
While each game-show producer is trying to carve a separate niche, all keep an 
eye on the basic elements that have made "Wheel" an institution. More than 
anything else, game shows have to get viewers involved. Part of the genius of 
"Wheel," say observers, is that it's designed to make the folks at home feel 
smarter than the contestants. Even when an answer becomes obvious, the show's 
contestants often must wait to guess. By that time, viewers are ready to burst, 
wishing they could tell Vanna the answer.

"You've got to have a game show people can play along with," says Rick Feldman, 
general manager of Los Angeles station KCOP Channel 13. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman already has purchased "Tic Tac Dough" and "Joker's Wild" for next year, 
believing that the remakes already have "recognizability." 
</P>
<P>
A look at some of the games shows considered to have the best chance of making 
it: 
</P>
<P>
* "Monopoly" -- Griffin and the King Brothers have managed to boil down the 
board game so it takes less than a half hour to play. But Monopoly purist may 
squirm at the way this is accomplished. Contestants gain properties by guessing 
easy questions (Q: Wabbit hunter. A: Elmer Fudd.). The players buy houses and 
hotels off-camera during the commercial breaks and a midget in a tux runs 
around a giant board to mark where each player has landed. The host, the midget 
and winner dance around the board at the end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Michael King of King World says that his Monopoly rules are a little different 
than the standard rules, but he argues that "nobody really plays Monopoly by 
the same set of rules." 
</P>
<P>
"Merv may not know what casinos to buy, but he knows what game shows to buy," 
says Bill Carroll, director of programming for Katz American Television, a 
consulting firm. "Merv was able to take hangman and make 'Wheel of Fortune.' I 
can't discount his ability to take a board game and make it a video game." 
Nonetheless, he says it's too early to tell whether the show will make it. 
</P>
<P>
* "Challengers" -- With Dick Clark as host, this game asks contestants tough, 
often topical and newsy questions. The producers plan to tape the show 
year-round so they can keep the questions current. The show is designed to air 
just before or after evening newscasts, a lucrative location for syndicated 
fare. "We thought the audience interest in question-and-answer shows was being 
underserved," says Jamie Bennett, senior vice president at Buena Vista 
Television, which will distribute the program. " 'Wheel of Fortune' is a 
wonderful show, but you don't watch 'Wheel of Fortune' to get information. 
There is a viewer benefit when you get information." 
</P>
<P>
" 'Challengers' is the obvious front-runner," says Carroll of the Katz 
consulting firm. "They've got the Big Mo. They were first in the marketplace, 
they have a good pilot, a credible host, an aggressive syndicator. Put that all 
together you've got deals." 
</P>
<P>
Feldman, on the other hand, complains that "Challengers" is "derivative -- too 
much like 'Jeopardy!' for its own good." 
</P>
<P>
Sample pilot question: Name the two sons in "Death of a Salesman." 
</P>
<P>
* "Trump Card" -- Donald Trump has lent his name to the show, but not his body. 
The show is like bingo with the winner spelling out T-R-U-M-P. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now they have a name, they don't have a game," scoffs Carroll. "If I 
want to play bingo, I go to the parish hall." 
</P>
<P>
* "Name That Tune" -- Entertainer Peter Allen is set to host this remake. "They 
have a good pilot," says Feldman. "It's really more miscellaneous trivia than a 
quiz show." 
</P>
<P>
"It's played more for entertainment value than anything else," says Carroll. He 
found host Allen a little too much "like a hyperactive kid," but declared that 
"fixable." 
</P>
<P>
* "Quiz Kids Challenge" -- The first game show from movie moguls Jon Peters and 
Peter Guber will pit kids against adults in a battle of the brains.

MUSEUM DONORS EXHIBIT THE ART OF GIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Philip and Beatrice Gersh collect art for an old-fashioned reason: They love 
the stuff. And they deal with their most valuable possessions in an 
old-fashioned way: They give them away. 
</P>
<P>
As owner of a long-established talent agency and a collector for 35 years, 
Philip Gersh has had calls from studio executives seeking advice on how to 
invest in art. His answer: "We don't buy that way. You have to buy because you 
love the art. If you are concerned about liquidity and investment, forget it." 
</P>
<P>
He and and his wife, who is a trustee of the Museum of Contemporary Art, are 
dismayed by wealthy collectors who cash in on their art at auction. "They don't 
need the money," Philip Gersh scoffed. "You hear that certain pieces have 
become too valuable to keep in private collections. If the art is so valuable, 
it should be given to museums. The more valuable it is, the more reason that a 
museum should have it." 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, before the art market zoomed into the stratosphere and before 
the 1986 income-tax law reduced art donors' deductions to the purchase price of 
an artwork, instead of the appreciated price, the Gershes' attitude toward 
their collection was relatively commonplace. But the new tax law has reduced 
gifts of art to museums by 63%, a study by the Assn. of Art Museum Directors 
shows. At the same time, rising prices have shut museums out of the market. 
With paintings going for $20 million, $30 million, $40 million or even $50 
million a pop at auction, generosity seems to be an idea whose time has passed. 
</P>
<P>
"Is the ethic of philanthropy an archaic notion? I'm afraid that's about 90% 
accurate," Philip Gersh said. That fear is part of the reason for a current 
show of the Gersh collection at the Museum of Contemporary Art. The exhibition 
at MOCA (to March 11) includes eight works that the Gershes have given or 
promised to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Prime among them is "Cubi III," an 8-foot-tall aluminum sculpture by David 
Smith, whose works have brought as much as $1.3 million at auction. When the 
show opened, the 1961 sculpture was promised to the museum, but the couple have 
subsequently made a "partial gift" of the valuable work and have agreed to give 
the piece entirely to MOCA soon. 
</P>
<P>
The towering sculpture -- which is one of two "Cubi" pieces still in private 
hands -- is essential to a contemporary art museum's collection, MOCA director 
Richard Koshalek said. 
</P>
<P>
Another "partial gift" from the Gershes is "Number 3," a small 1948 drip 
painting by Jackson Pollock, whose auction record is $10.5 million. The other 
Gersh gifts are less pricey but highly desirable acquisitions for the museum: a 
mixed-media collage by Alexis Smith, a photograph by Boyd Webb and paintings by 
Ed Ruscha, Susan Rothenberg, Neil Jenney and Tom Wudl. 
</P>
<P>
The Gershes hope that MOCA's show of their collection will encourage others to 
give. Their example has already produced at least two followers: their sons 
Robert and David Gersh who collect contemporary art and support the museum. 
</P>
<P>
"Collecting has enriched our lives," Beatrice Gersh said. "Art is not a 
commodity. It's something that gives great pleasure because of its quiet 
beauty, which can take many different forms. We feel strongly that the works we 
have should live together in our home and we've spent many years refining the 
collection." 
</P>
<P>
Every work that has become part of their collection has a life story. Wandering 
around the show and marveling at how different the art looks in a museum 
setting, the Gershes recounted tales of artworks bought in a fit of passion and 
others purchased after long periods of deliberation, dusty artworks rescued 
from storage bins and fresh ones snapped off delivery trucks. 
</P>
<P>
There are also stories about artworks lost and gained. One dealer reneged on 
the sale of a Jean Dubuffet collage when a more valued client wanted it, but 
then came through with a better piece. Beatrice Gersh once missed a Francis 
Bacon painting because her husband found it too disturbing, she said. Years 
later, when she saw Bacon's "Portrait of a Man With Glasses" in a London show, 
she announced that she wouldn't leave the gallery until they bought it. The 
small 1963 portrait is on view at MOCA in an intimate display of works by 
20th-Century masters. 
</P>
<P>
"In the early years Bea was way ahead of me, but now our eyes have adjusted to 
the point that we often go for exactly the same thing," Philip Gersh said. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was ahead it's only because I devoted more time to it," Beatrice Gersh 
said. "One problem with many collectors starting out now is that they don't 
have any idea of the past and how it relates to the art of our time. You have 
to put in a lot of time, going to galleries and museums, looking and getting 
trained." 
</P>
<P>
The Gershes have never employed a curator or an adviser to tell them what to 
buy. Instead, they have taken their own education in hand, traveling widely to 
see exhibitions and continually working to keep up with the changing scene. 
</P>
<P>
They stand out as a rare example of public-spirited collectors, but they are 
not entirely alone in Los Angeles. Earlier this year, the Museum of 
Contemporary Art received a $60-million donation of classic modern and 
contemporary art from the Rita and Taft Schreiber collection. Among the 18 
works by 13 artists are paintings by Pollock, Mark Rothko, Piet Mondrian and 
Arshile Gorky, and sculpture by Alberto Giacometti. 
</P>
<P>
During the past three years, MOCA has also received works by Christian 
Boltanski and Sarah Charlesworth from Peter and Eileen Norton; a John 
Chamberlain sculpture from Robert Halff; and Red Grooms' near life-size 
re-creation of a "Discount Store" from Irma and Norman Braman. Among other 
gifts, MOCA trustees Eli Broad and Douglas S. Cramer have each donated funds 
for the purchase of art. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Museum of Art also has angels who remain devoted despite 
current tax laws. Pop singer Graham Nash recently announced that he will 
present the museum with about 140 photographs, plus half the profits from an 
upcoming auction of his photography collection. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond and Frances Bushell have donated 141 Japanese netsuke as part of a 
larger miniature sculpture collection promised to the county museum. Mary 
Stansbury Ruiz bequeathed more than 600 Mannerist prints to LACMA, while Hans 
and Varya Cohn have donated more than 200 examples of ancient, Sasanian, 
Islamic and Indian glass. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors Howard and Gwen Laurie Smits in 1987 gave the museum 171 
contemporary ceramic works and subsequently established an endowment fund for 
the purchase of 20th-Century ceramics. In making the gift, the Smits said that 
the donation was the best way to make "maximum use" of their collection. 
</P>
<P>
Film producer Ray Stark last year gave the museum Ellsworth Kelly's "White 
Sculpture II," a massive painted aluminum piece. "I have another one and I 
thought this sculpture would go well with the museum's collection," Stark said. 
Denying that he has "great altruistic motivations," Stark nonetheless said that 
he plans to give most of his sculpture collection to the County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a shame that the government discourages gifts of art. I can 
understand people who don't want to give now (under present tax laws), but my 
personal feeling is that eventually I would like most of my sculpture to go to 
the museum," Stark said. 
</P>
<P>
The Gershes, like many other museum supporters, hope that income tax laws will 
be changed again to allow deductions for the appreciated value of art. "All our 
great museums have been endowed by great private collectors. The Reagan and 
Bush administrations have emphasized the responsibility of the private sector, 
but private collectors are selling at auction now -- and at astronomical 
prices," Philip Gersh said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple used to buy at auction, when bargains could be had, but now they 
stay away. And they entertain no thoughts of cashing in. "We're very happy in 
giving. We know people are going to enjoy the art," Beatrice Gersh said.

'FORBIDDEN CITY': SONG-AND-DANCE BRILLIANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1930s, Charlie Low came to San Francisco from his native Nevada, as he 
tells film maker Arthur Dong in "Forbidden City U.S.A." (tonight at 9, Channels 
15 and 28), "with different ideas in the back of my head." What emerged was a 
fairly stunning and charming episode in the history of America's cultural 
diversity: The first nightclub with an all-Chinese floor show. 
</P>
<P>
As in "Cabaret," where a Berlin nightclub became a medium through which the 
corrupt Weimar German society was revealed, Dong's film gracefully shows how 
one semi-underground club brought all manner of American contradictions to the 
surface. The young entertainers first had to break from centuries of cultural 
codes: that men ran the business, that women stayed at home and that 
performers' lives were sinful. 
</P>
<P>
Then, they had to prove their stuff to white producers and audiences. Like 
their non-white counterparts, the Asian-American hoofers and singers had to be 
twice as good as the white competition. But there was an extra burden -- the 
assumption, as one "Forbidden City" veteran recalled, "that Chinese couldn't 
swing." 
</P>
<P>
One look at the elegant film sequences of Paul Wing and Dorothy Toy -- billed 
as a kind of Chinese Astaire and Rogers, even though Toy was actually Japanese 
-- buries that silly claim forever. But, like much of "Forbidden City U.S.A.," 
the joy of uncovering this buried nugget of song-and-dance brilliance has a 
bittersweet edge. Once Hollywood beckoned the duo during the early days of 
World War II, the U.S. government barred Toy from employment because of her 
Japanese ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
Low's club just wasn't the same after the war. As Paul Wing notes: "The novelty 
wore off." Not even Chinese girls prancing around the room, dressed in nothing 
but big feathers, could draw them in. Dong's predictable style, cutting back 
and forth between talking heads and photos and footage, makes "Forbidden City 
U.S.A." less than it could be. And yet the now-old faces reveal the ticklish 
excitement of the days when they dared to do something sweetly forbidden.

WILSON WILL MAKE MUSIC WITH NEA GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It sure is a nice way to start the decade," said Gerald Wilson, who has just 
received a $20,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts under the 
American Masters Fellowship program. "Not just for the money, but because I'm 
happy to be of service by making some fresh music available to the community. 
</P>
<P>
"With this award," the Southland composer said, "I can do a few things for the 
orchestra that I haven't had the opportunity to do -- things I hope will be of 
lasting interest. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year I went out on a tour, conducting various college orchestras -- 
Rutgers, Berklee and several others. After leading the college orchestras I 
donated 10 or 12 of my original compositions to their libraries." 
</P>
<P>
One of Wilson's stops, at the New England Conservatory, found him sharing a 
concert with George Russell, another grant recipient. Russell, 66, is a teacher 
at the Conservatory. Pianist-composer Cecil Taylor, 60, the third award-winner, 
has long been active as an avant-gardist and teacher at several Eastern 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with the music he plans to write under the funding, 71-year-old Wilson 
will expand his activities this year, taking his own band to leading jazz 
festivals across the country. Meanwhile, he is set for two weekends at Marla's 
Memory Lane starting Feb. 2 and a concert at the Wadsworth Theater on Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Originally prominent as a trumpeter and arranger with the Jimmie Lunceford 
Orchestra, Wilson settled in Los Angeles in 1942 and formed his own Big Band 
two years later. He found out, the hard way, that keeping an 18-member band 
together in the post-Swing Era was as simple as juggling 18 balls in the air. 
But because he wanted a showcase for his unique, highly personal music, he 
never gave up. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been able to keep my music out there," he said, "with the help of Albert 
Marx, who's produced all my albums since 1961 -- first for Pacific Jazz, and 
now on his own Discovery Records. But I've been lucky enough to do quite a few 
other things." 
</P>
<P>
When band dates wore thin, he spent several years as the host of a record show 
on KBCA (now KKGO). From 1969 he taught jazz history at Cal State Northridge. 
Since 1983 he has been a part-time professor at Cal State L.A. In 1972 he 
composed the first of eight works performed at the Music Center by Zubin Mehta 
and the Los Angeles Philharmonic with a large gospel choir. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great honor," summed up Wilson, "particularly since this is not 
something you can apply for." 
</P>
<P>
Previous winner of the endowment fellowships have included Count Basie and 
Dizzy Gillespie-in both of whose bands Wilson played in the late 1940-and Ella 
Fitzgerald.

VENTURA BANK OPENS TRADING ON NASDAQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the opening of the stock market today, shares of Ventura County National 
Bancorp will start trading on the NASDAQ National Market System -- the big 
leagues of over-the-counter market governed by the National Assn. of Securities 
Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, VCNB, whose main unit is Oxnard-based Ventura County National Bank, 
had been a "pink-sheet" stock that was thinly traded and virtually ignored by 
analysts. By moving to the National Market System, the stock's visibility among 
investors improves greatly. 
</P>
<P>
For William E. McAleer, president of the holding company and chairman of its 
bank, the new listing also could help his expansion plans for VCNB. 
</P>
<P>
VCNB, which caters mostly to local, mid-size businesses with annual sales of $1 
million to $50 million, has grown to $243 million in assets since it was 
founded by 11 local business people in 1982. VCNB is still a pipsqueak, but 
McAleer expects his bank to keep growing -- with its assets hitting $450 
million or $500 million by late 1990 -- in part by buying other banks. 
</P>
<P>
"Our plan is to add another acquisition, or at least be able to announce one, 
before the middle of next year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking with four banks now," he added, declining to identify the 
potential partners. 
</P>
<P>
Once VCNB finds a bank to buy, it might want to purchase it with its stock 
rather than cash. In that case, having its stock on the National Market System, 
where many more investors are available to buy or sell the shares compared with 
the pink-sheet market, could make VCNB's offer more palatable to the target 
bank's sellers. 
</P>
<P>
For all of McAleer's growth plans, the likelihood is that, in the 1990s, VCNB 
will be bought. Beginning in 1991, East Coast banks will be allowed to buy 
California banks. In other areas of the nation where interstate banking has 
been introduced, tiny yet well-run banks like VCNB have been gobbled up. Of 
course, the bigger VCNB gets, the more likely its stockholders are to profit if 
the bank is acquired. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to sell, because I need a job," McAleer said, adding that he 
hopes to keep VCNB independent. But the total value of VCNB's stock today is 
about $44 million, and VCNB's management would be hard-pressed to fend off any 
viable offer. 
</P>
<P>
McAleer -- who earned $185,000 in salary and bonuses in 1988 -- owns less than 
1% of VCNB's stock, and none of the bank's officers own more than 5%. Together, 
however, the officers and VCNB's employee stock ownership plan own about 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Even if it is not bought right away, VCNB must grow to survive in the early 
1990s after banks from the East Coast and elsewhere set up shop here. "It's 
going to take that critical size in order . . . to compete," McAleer said. 
</P>
<P>
VCNB already has bought two other business banks: Conejo Valley National Bank, 
based in Thousand Oaks, which VCNB bought in exchange for its stock in late 
1986; and Frontier Group, owner of the one-office Frontier Bank in La Palma, 
which VCNB bought for $8 million in mid-1989. The Frontier deal gave VCNB a 
beachhead in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But McAleer's sights are broader. "We have 19 areas within Southern California 
that we consider the areas of intense commercial-industrial growth," he said. 
Among them are the National City-San Ysidro and El Cajon areas near San Diego, 
and the Fontana-Upland region east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We would love to be in these areas," said McAleer, whose second-floor office 
is in a 14-story building that, with Union Bank's skyscraper, highlight 
Oxnard's financial center next to the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees with McAleer's approach, including Marshall C. Milligan, 
president of Levy Bancorp, the Ventura-based parent of the Bank of A. Levy and 
VCNB's neighborhood rival. Milligan's bank, which serves both consumer and 
business, is twice VCNB's size, with $582 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
"In contrast to VCNB, I don't believe in growth for growth's sake," Milligan 
said. "I frankly don't understand that strategy, and I don't understand the 
strategy of buying a bank in Orange County. We feel we serve the customer best 
when we target ourselves, as opposed to broadening our scope." 
</P>
<P>
McAleer said he bought Frontier, which kept its name, for a simple reason: "We 
could immediately make more money with it." Frontier is a small bank ($70 
million in assets) that had loaned out 52% of its deposits, compared to 85% at 
VCNB. Under VCNB's guidance, Frontier quickly put an additional $13 million of 
loans on its books and raised its pretax profit by $500,000, McAleer said. 
</P>
<P>
Frontier also gives VCNB entrance into the huge Orange County commercial 
market, he said, dismissing suggestions that Orange County already has plenty 
of hometown business banks. "None of them are large," that is, with assets 
above $500 million, he said. "There's a lot of room for competition." 
</P>
<P>
Whether McAleer can repeat that success in other parts of Southern California 
remains to be seen, but VCNB generally has maintained strong profits while it 
has grown. 
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of 1989, VCNB earned $2.1 million -- equal to its 
profit for all of 1988 -- and its return on average assets, or ROA, in the nine 
months and in 1988 were 1.22% and 1.10%, respectively, well above the 1% 
reading that is considered an excellent performance. An ROA shows how 
profitably a bank uses assets at its disposal. (The figure is found by dividing 
a bank's annual profit by its average assets for the period.) 
</P>
<P>
VCNB's only down year came in 1986, when its earnings plunged to $225,000 from 
$1.3 million the previous year. The drop reflected costs associated with VCNB's 
purchase of Conejo Valley National Bank. One of Conejo Valley's subsidiaries 
was saddled with problem loans, McAleer said. 
</P>
<P>
VCNB's stock price has advanced with its earnings growth. After going public at 
$10 a share in 1982, the stock now sells for the equivalent of $43.75 a share, 
if subsequent stock splits and stock dividends were excluded. (Adjusted for 
those items, the stock now trades at about $10 a share.) 
</P>
<P>
McAleer, a Los Angeles native, worked for Security Pacific, Barclay's and 
Orange County Bank in Southern California. He moved to Oklahoma in 1979 and 
held executive positions at two banks in the Tulsa area. He left Oklahoma just 
as the state's energy woes were about to make trouble for many banks there, and 
in 1982 got the job as VCNB's first president after seeing the bank's 
help-wanted ad in a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's searching for other banks to buy, but he noted that much of VCNB's 
growth is internally generated. VCNB attributes much of that growth to services 
it provides business customers, such as couriers to pick up deposits, and a 
computer system that enables clients to quickly monitor and adjust their 
checking accounts, investments and loans. 
</P>
<P>
McAleer still has a way to go just to impress his hometown rival, Levy 
Bancorp's Milligan. "They haven't taken a big chunk of our business," Milligan 
said. "They've been more effective at creating that image, but I don't think 
that actually translates into volume of business. We do a lot more business 
banking in the county than they do." 
</P>
<P>
But one thing Milligan can't dismiss: In seven years, VCNB has become half as 
large as Levy, which was founded 100 years earlier.

CHP, POLICE ARREST 250 MOTORISTS 
</P>

<P>
On what turned out to be an unusually quiet New Year's weekend, Orange County 
police agencies ushered in 1990 by rounding up more than 250 suspected drunk 
drivers and investigating sporadic reports of holiday gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of the driving-under-the-influence, or DUI, arrests were made 
by the Costa Mesa police, Santa Ana police and California Highway Patrol, who 
conducted intensive crackdowns with roving patrols. 
</P>
<P>
Most other Orange County cities, however, reported only a smattering of DUI 
arrests during the three-day holiday, despite a new state law that, effective 
Monday, lowered the blood-alcohol level for drunk driving from 0.10% to 0.08%. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police said they made only four DUI arrests all weekend, even though 
they set up sobriety checkpoints both Friday night and New Year's Eve and 
questioned more than 1,500 motorists. Two years ago, by comparison, Anaheim 
police arrested eight people on suspicion of drunk driving at a single New 
Year's Eve checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that, hopefully, people are finally wising up and letting their 
friends drive if they drink," said Anaheim Police Sgt. Frank Van DeWeerd. 
</P>
<P>
In Huntington Beach, where police arrested three suspected drunk drivers, Sgt. 
Luis Ochoa attributed the low number of arrests to a dense layer of fog that 
blanketed many coastal areas and reduced New Year's Eve traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very, very quiet, which is unusual for us on New Year's Eve," Ochoa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the hazardous driving conditions, Orange County law enforcement 
officials reported no upsurge in traffic accidents and no fatal accidents over 
the holiday weekend. The fog extended as far inland as Fountain Valley, where 
things were so slow that officers made only seven DUI arrests and were sent out 
on just four complaints of wild parties. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked years past where we couldn't stop" all night long, Sgt. Don 
Nielsen said. 
</P>
<P>
The holiday was also comparatively quiet in terms of gunfire from holiday 
revelers, a tradition in predominantly Latino areas of the county. Immigrants 
from Mexico and other Latin American countries, police officials say, are used 
to celebrating the new year with pistol shots into the air. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to past years, when hundreds of bullets rained down over vast 
portions of Orange County, only police in Santa Ana and Westminster had any 
significant shooting activity to report. Police attributed the apparent 
downturn in shooting to an education campaign that included the distribution of 
leaflets in Latino neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, seven mobile homes "took a round through the roof" from falling 
bullets, Lt. Greg Cooper said. Last year, by comparison, Santa Ana police 
fielded 24 reports of property damage from holiday gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
The only reported injury on New Year's Eve was to a pedestrian in Santa Ana who 
suffered a graze wound to the leg from one of the falling bullets. But Cooper 
said it was so superficial that the man did not require medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
In Westminster, police received five reports of shots being fired into the air 
and recovered one pistol that had been discarded by a reveler as officers sped 
to one of the scenes. No damage or injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Compared to last year, it was almost like there was nothing going on," 
Westminster Police Lt. Bob Burnett said. 
</P>
<P>
The busiest police activity over the New Year's weekend was generated by the 
drunk-driving patrols instituted by the CHP and by police in Costa Mesa and 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa police arrested 46 suspected drunk drivers during a nine-hour 
enforcement program that began Sunday evening. The arrests, made by a 14-person 
task force on roving patrols, topped last year's arrest total by 16, Sgt. Tom 
Winter said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very, very effective program," Winter said. 
</P>
<P>
Those arrested were detained in Costa Mesa City Jail, which was staffed with 
extra personnel to process records and paper work, Winter said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police, also operating in roving patrols, arrested 55 suspected drunk 
drivers during a special crackdown period between Friday afternoon and Monday 
morning, Lt. Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers arrested 101 motorists in the county during the same period, CHP 
spokesman Keith Thornhill said. The arrest breakdown included 46 in the CHP's 
Santa Ana district, 30 in the San Juan Capistrano district and 25 in the 
Westminster district, Thornhill said.

AFTER 5-PLUS YEARS OF DELAY, MURDER CASE TO BE HEARD

<P>
The Thomas Maniscalco case is about biker culture and murder -- three people 
shot down in their home in a middle-class Westminster neighborhood on Memorial 
Day weekend in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
But in the five-plus years since Maniscalco's arrest, murder often has been a 
secondary issue in his case. Instead, the radical lawyer who helped found the 
Hessian motorcycle gang has pitted himself against the justice system, 
challenging the grand jury process, his judges, his prosecutors, and even his 
jailers. 
</P>
<P>
The case has also been plagued by problems no one could foresee -- including a 
major foul-up in a court reporter's transcript and even a judge's suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, the focus finally shifts back to the house on Navajo Road where 
two men and a young woman were found shot to death. Twelve jurors and six 
alternates will hear Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard M. King's opening statement 
about a tale of drugs and counterfeit money among the bikers, who lived 
incongruously in a neighborhood of working-class families and weekend 
barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
Maniscalco, prosecutors contend, may have been a lawyer by day, but at other 
times he was heavily involved in the trafficking of drugs and counterfeit money 
-- $500,000 in fake $50 and $100 bills. Maniscalco, now 44, was the leader of a 
group of younger people from the drug culture to whom he opened up his home, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
Internal problems in the group, they theorize, led to the execution-style 
murder of Richard (Rabbit) Rizzone, 36, who had been Maniscalco's best friend 
and had lived with him at times. The other two victims, they say, were simply 
unfortunate enough to be in the house with Rizzone. One of them was a 
19-year-old girl, killed after she was raped and then forced to lead the 
killers through the house to find Rizzone's keys. 
</P>
<P>
Maniscalco has denied killing the three. 
</P>
<P>
Maniscalco and Rizzone had grown up in New York together, had moved to 
California together, and were part of the group that founded the Hessians 
during the Vietnam War years. 
</P>
<P>
When Rizzone was arrested on drug charges in 1978, he listed Maniscalco's name 
in the "next of kin" box. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't kill Rabbit; Rabbit was my friend," Maniscalco said in a jailhouse 
interview several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors claim that the friendship of Maniscalco and Rizzone had waned. 
Maniscalco had told friends that Rizzone had taken for himself more than 
$30,000 in counterfeit money and also stolen drugs from him, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men living at Maniscalco's house, Robert Robbins, later testified 
that Maniscalco first tried to kill Rizzone by brushing poison on counterfeit 
bills he sent him, so that Rizzone eventually would ingest the poison off his 
finger. 
</P>
<P>
When that failed, Maniscalco and confederates Phil Warren, Daniel Duffy and 
Robbins went to Rizzone's home to kill him, Robbins said. Warren did the actual 
killing, Robbins testified. He alleges it was also Warren who raped the young 
woman, Rena Miley, before killing her. And, he said, it was Warren who killed 
Thomas Monahan, 28, a friend of Rizzone who stayed with him sometimes and who 
came to the house right after Rizzone was shot. But it was Maniscalco who was 
in charge, Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said Maniscalco ordered him to take Rizzone's Harley Davidson 
motorcycle with him when Robbins and Warren left for Michigan the next day. 
Prosecutors contend that Maniscalco planned to have Robbins killed, so that 
when the motorcycle was traced back to Rizzone, police would blame Robbins for 
the triple slaying in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Maniscalco's lawyer, Joanne Harrold, has her own theories about what happened. 
She points out that another key witness against Maniscalco -- a biker named 
Bruce Van Arsdell -- ended up in Michigan with Warren and Robbins. The three of 
them, she contends, killed the people in the Westminster house and planned all 
along to make Maniscalco their fall guy. 
</P>
<P>
Maniscalco and Duffy, who now face a death penalty if convicted, were arrested 
in March, 1984, after Van Arsdell agreed to talk to investigators. He had been 
living with Maniscalco at the time of the shootings and has key evidence about 
the lawyer's activities unrelated to his law practice. 
</P>
<P>
Warren may have been a victim of his own fears of being arrested. He was 
questioned by police in Moore, Okla., on July 30, 1982, when he tried to use a 
phony name on a driver's license application. The surprised officers were 
forced to shoot him to death after he tried to kill both of them with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, who is under protection from the authorities, without question is the 
star witness. Prosecutor King will have to rely on many witnesses who either 
were engaged in criminal activities or are now in jail convicted of crimes. But 
his witness list also includes law enforcement authorities from five police 
departments, the FBI, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and 
the U.S. Secret Service. 
</P>
<P>
King has declined to comment on the facts of the case. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just delighted that finally the community is going to have its day in 
court," King said. 
</P>
<P>
King's office has been seething for years over the trial delays, almost all 
caused by the defense. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense has everything to gain and nothing to lose from delaying the 
trial," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Brent F. Romney, who has handled most of the 
pretrial motions. "Especially with the penalty their client could face." 
</P>
<P>
The first major problem was that charges were dismissed for tactical reasons so 
that Maniscalco could be indicted after a grand jury hearing. But the grand 
jury transcript was so riddled with errors it was unusable, and prosecutors had 
to seek a "superseding" grand jury indictment. It took more than a year and two 
trips to the state Supreme Court to resolve the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The next issue to stall the case was Maniscalco's objections to Superior Court 
Judge Theodore E. Millard as the trial judge. Millard was a former prosecutor 
who had been peripherally involved with one of Maniscalco's former clients, who 
was also a potential witness in his case. 
</P>
<P>
After more than a year of court hearings, Millard decided in 1988 to excuse 
himself from the case, so that it wouldn't be delayed further. He was replaced 
by Judge James R. Franks II. But because of a serious illness, Judge Franks had 
to relinquish the case -- after he had already begun jury selection -- to Judge 
Kathleen E. O'Leary last summer. When Judge Franks committed suicide in August, 
the case was further delayed because he had been scheduled to finish up one 
stage of jury selection. 
</P>
<P>
O'Leary ordered several hearings to run into the night -- from 8 a.m. to 7:30 
p.m. -- to prevent further delays in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
All of the judges on the case have faced a near avalanche of defense motions, 
many of which were not relevant to the case, prosecutors have claimed. 
Maniscalco's attorney Harrold and her co-counsel, Andrew Roth, also asked for 
sanctions against prosecutors, claiming they had deliberately withheld evidence 
to hamper the defense. O'Leary denied the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
The arguments were bitter at the least. 
</P>
<P>
"Ms. Harrold is lying," prosecutor King said at one hearing in O'Leary's court. 
"If Ms. Harrold were Pinocchio, her nose would grow so long it would go out the 
door and all the way down the hallway." 
</P>
<P>
Harrold seethed. But she has made biting comments of her own. "Prosecutors have 
resisted and interfered with discovery (providing the defense with information, 
required by law) repeatedly," she wrote in court papers. She called the 
Maniscalco case "a classic example" of an ongoing district attorney practice of 
not providing defense lawyers with evidence to which they are entitled. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the defense bristled again. Maniscalco had been ordered to court 
from the Orange County Jail on Thursday by mistake. On Friday, when Maniscalco 
was supposed to be in court, Harrold did not show up and Judge O'Leary had to 
wait into the noon hour for co-counsel Roth to appear instead at a final 
hearing. Prosecutors had asked for the court session to expand the dates on the 
papers charging Maniscalco with the murders, to include the Friday before 
Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
"This is bizarre," Roth complained. "Five and a half years (go by) and they 
just now decide what day they want to say the murders occurred." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy D.A. Romney emphasizes that many of the defense motions were meritorious 
enough to resolve in court. But, he added, "far too many of them were frivolous 
in my opinion, and that's had a lot to do with why this case has taken so long 
to get to trial." 
</P>
<P>
Harrold blames prosecutors for the delays. In addition to the dispute over 
discovery, she criticizes King and Romney for trying to make it a drug and 
counterfeit case. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was defending a murder case," she said. "But Rick King is going to 
throw in everything he can to muddy up the waters." 
</P>
<P>
In his court papers, King contends that the counterfeit and drug evidence is 
important to show Maniscalco's motive for wanting Rizzone dead. 
</P>
<P>
Maniscalco has not been idle during his 5 1/2 years in jail. He has gained 
notoriety as a jailhouse lawyer and has been a leader in a move to improve jail 
conditions. Many claim, however, that Maniscalco has manufactured many of the 
complaints he has made about jail deputies beating inmates. Now his lawyers say 
his trial could be affected by his need for medical attention. He suffers from 
back pains and needs dental work. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony in the case will not begin until Wednesday. One person who will no 
doubt follow the Maniscalco case carefully from the Orange County Jail will be 
Duffy. His trial on the same charges is scheduled to follow Maniscalco's. 
</P>
<P>
"The witnesses are the same," one lawyer involved said. "If Maniscalco hangs, 
Duffy knows it will be bleak for him."

DEVELOPMENT: HUNTINGTON BEACH OFFICIALS SEE ALL THE CONSTRUCTION AS A GOOD

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bounded by the ocean on one side and thickly settled cities on the other, this 
80-year-old beach town would appear to have been built out long ago. 
</P>
<P>
But appearances are deceiving. The city, the third-largest in the county, 
expects to add about 35,000 residents over the next 20 years -- as many as the 
entire population of Brea. 
</P>
<P>
"The city currently has a population of about 189,000," said Hal Simmons, 
senior planner for the city. "By the time we reach build-out, which we forecast 
in 2010, the city will have a population of about 225,000." 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for former oil fields in the southwest corner of the city to be 
cleared for for a 768-acre housing and commercial development called 
Holly-Seacliff. North of the city, a development proposal for the Bolsa Chica 
area, long in dispute between builders and environmentalists, has been settled, 
clearing the way for several hundred homes to be built. The blighted downtown 
area is being redeveloped, and construction of new condominiums and apartments 
throughout the city is accelerating. 
</P>
<P>
The growth spurt -- expected to add about 15,000 homes by the year 2010 -- will 
mean more taxable income. It also is expected to bring more children to the 
city's school districts, which have suffered declining enrollments over the 
past decade. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Riddell, executive vice president of the Huntington Beach Chamber of 
Commerce, said the new growth "is very exciting." The new housing will "bring 
increased tax increments to the city," Riddell said, "and the new residential 
areas will be nice additions to the city. The future is very bright for 
Huntington Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Diana Peters, superintendent of Huntington Beach City School District, whose 
elementary schools are in most of the areas targeted for growth in the 1990s, 
also was enthusiastic about the new residential developments. 
</P>
<P>
Until last year, the district had been losing pupils for more than a decade. 
Peters said at least one new elementary school for 650 children may be needed 
to accommodate the expected jump in enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly more stimulating to be thinking about growth than (about) those 
years of declining enrollment, which brought about painful things such as cuts 
and layoffs," Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
But there is also a downside to all the growth, some residents say. 
</P>
<P>
"I see large problems," said Loretta Wolfe, president of Huntington Beach 
Tomorrow, a residents group concerned about planning in the city. "This growth 
will bring an infrastructure problem -- things such as water availability and 
sewer capacity. The sewers are already at max in that area, and Coast Highway, 
which is the main link to the freeways from that area, is already overloaded." 
</P>
<P>
Dianne Easterling, a director of Huntington Beach Tomorrow, calls traffic "a 
major concern." 
</P>
<P>
"We're also concerned about density and open space," Easterling said. "The 
Holly-Seacliff development is so big it's like a city within a city." 
</P>
<P>
The final master plan for Holly-Seacliff is scheduled to go before the City 
Council at its Jan. 8 meeting. That plan, which the city staff has urged the 
council to approve, calls for 5,330 housing units, a neighborhood shopping 
center and business offices. The project would be built in the area bounded 
roughly by Ellis Avenue on the north, Huntington and Main streets on the east, 
Yorktown and Clay avenues to the south, and the bluffs west of Edwards Street 
on the west. The site is now mostly vacant except for a number of oil pumps 
that are scheduled to be removed. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Thomas J. Mays is bullish on the project. 
</P>
<P>
"Holly-Seacliff will convert basically degraded land covered with oil wells and 
make it into one of the most beautiful areas of the city -- complete with at 
least four new parks in that area," Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
To the west of the Holly-Seacliff area, about 5,000 new houses have been 
proposed for the bluffs near the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, after years of legal wrangling between environmentalists and Signal 
Landmark Corp., the principal landowner and developer, a settlement was reached 
that will allow development to proceed. The terms of the agreement call for 
Signal Landmark to donate a large share of the land for use as wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Mays is also optimistic about this project. 
</P>
<P>
"Bolsa Chica will go from 300 acres of restored wetlands to 1,150 acres -- one 
of the largest wetlands on the California coast, while still allowing 
development on the bluffs," Mays said. "The restored wetlands are going to be 
such a tourist attraction that we expect people will be coming from all over to 
see this area." 
</P>
<P>
Bolsa Chica is outside the city limits, but Huntington Beach intends to annex 
the area as development gets under way. James Colangelo, director of the county 
Local Area Formation Commission, said that the Bolsa Chica has already been 
placed in Huntington Beach's "sphere of influence," a step leading to eventual 
annexation. 
</P>
<P>
In the downtown area near the pier, about 336 acres along Pacific Coast Highway 
and Main Street are being redeveloped to include luxury condominiums, hotels 
and a shopping area. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the old dwellings have been replaced by higher-density residential 
units," Simmons said. "We expect an increase of about 5,000 more units of 
housing from the recycling that is going on in the downtown area." 
</P>
<P>
Mays said planning is the key to coping with the changes expected to occur with 
the new growth of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to maintain the level of service we now have for our residents while 
growing to handle the new residents," Mays said. "I think planning is very 
important, and I'm working for a strategic plan that would look at a 10-year 
period of time. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can plan for growth in a proper fashion, then the up side of that growth 
will be that we will be able to develop an economically viable base for the 
city, with enough revenue to maintain and improve the current services of that 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be city with a redeveloped downtown that is the real hub of 
activity -- the most viable downtown in the entire county."

PAIR FIGHT TO KEEP CANYON FROM BEING TURNED INTO BALLPARKS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Art Padgett and Charles Gorenstein acknowledge that Chapparosa Canyon, a 
narrow, seven-acre gorge hemmed in by rows of new stucco houses, is not much to 
look at. 
</P>
<P>
Home to several deer, a few hawks, toads and crawfish and some scattered clumps 
of bulrushes, the small canyon is not as visibly stirring as the expansive 
Laguna Canyon or the Bolsa Chica wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
But the grassy slice of rural countryside, a reminder of what Laguna Niguel 
once was, has stirred the two men to launch a campaign to save it. 
</P>
<P>
Chapparosa Canyon, the largest wetlands canyon that remains in rapidly growing 
Laguna Niguel, is scheduled for extinction under a city plan to convert the 
shallow gorge into ball fields. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have said there are not enough playing fields in Laguna Niguel, 
and, as a consequence, hundreds of youngsters have been unable to join 
organized sports. 
</P>
<P>
Pledging their opposition to the project, Gorenstein and Padgett have founded 
the Laguna Niguel Environmental Coalition and are pressing for preservation of 
the canyon as natural open space. 
</P>
<P>
Padgett, an engineering consultant, and Gorenstein, a UC Irvine professor of 
neural pharmacology, are lobbying to see the canyon transformed into an 
educational nature center instead of baseball diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
"This canyon is a diamond in the rough," said Gorenstein, who suggests planting 
native California shrubs, grasses and trees to create a living museum for area 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be a showplace for Laguna Niguel," Gorenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
The canyon, between Street of the Golden Lantern and Niguel Road, is fed by an 
underground spring that drains into Salt Creek and eventually into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
It is part of the 260-acre Salt Creek Community Park, much of which is now 
undeveloped but may in the future be used for a variety of recreational 
purposes, City Manager Warren S. (Ben) Benson said. 
</P>
<P>
The canyon, next to the 18-acre Chapparosa Park, would be filled in with 
130,000 cubic feet of dirt from Monarch Beach, and two ballparks would be built 
on the resulting flatland as an addition to the four existing fields in 
Chapparosa Park, Benson said. 
</P>
<P>
Australia-based Qintex America Inc. has agreed to complete the $2.6-million 
ball fields as part of an agreement with the city for a development project in 
Monarch Beach, Benson said. He said that despite the company's recent financial 
problems, the agreement remains intact. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Qintex, which backed out of a plan to develop a Dana Point 
resort in November, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Gorenstein and Padgett, however, said they have repeatedly proposed that the 
city find an alternate site for the ball fields. 
</P>
<P>
The public comment period on the project's environmental impact report ended 
Jan. 1, but coalition members have spent the past few weeks passing out 
thousands of flyers to drum up support for their cause. 
</P>
<P>
They have also escorted City Council members on a tour of the canyon and have 
urged residents to send letters of opposition to City Hall. So far, Benson 
said, city officials have received about 150 statements of opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The pair are scheduled to meet with Mayor Patricia Bates today to discuss their 
plan to build a nature center. 
</P>
<P>
Padgett and Gorenstein's effort is the latest in a growing trend in the South 
County to preserve what is left of undeveloped areas around suburban 
neighborhoods. Slow growth, in fact, has been a major political issue among San 
Clemente and San Juan Capistrano officials, who have been faced with cries to 
protect the shrinking open space. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the San Juan Capistrano City Council passed a law to preserve 
its miles of ridgelines and announced a plan to turn 120 acres of land north of 
Mission San Juan Capistrano into a "Central Park." 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Canyon and Laguna Beach residents have been fighting development plans 
in their communities, and San Clemente officials have criticized a proposal to 
build a regional airport in the hilly country north of their city. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is becoming more and more sensitive to issues of environment," 
Gorenstein said. "We talk about saving the rain forests and the whales. But 
there is something wrong if we can't save a simple canyon in our own back 
yard." 
</P>
<P>
Padgett added: "City Council members don't appear as sensitive to environmental 
issues as we thought they would be. It's almost as if they were 
pro-development." 
</P>
<P>
Several city officials said they have seriously been considering the 
coalition's suggestions but have not made up their minds. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen James F. Krembas, Paul M. Christiansen and Thomas W. Wilson said 
they support the concept of a nature park but also see a need for more 
recreational facilities for youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"I take exception to the comments that any of the council members are not 
responsive to the concerns over the environment," said Krembas, principal of 
San Clemente High School. 
</P>
<P>
"On the one side, I understand their concerns. But on the other side, we need 
more ball fields." 
</P>
<P>
Krembas said that he would prefer to relocate the playing fields. "I consider 
myself a strong advocate for the environment. That canyon is a unique area," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials have so far been unable to find a suitable alternative site 
for the playing fields, Krembas said. "We will have to take a good hard look at 
the issue."

AUDUBON, IRVINE CO. PROTECT THE HERONS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Bloom used to watch the great blue herons on Irvine Lake when he played 
there as a child. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Bloom is vice president of the Sea and Sage chapter of the Audubon 
Society and he is working with the Irvine Co. on a plan to build new homes in 
his childhood playground without disturbing the county's largest colony of the 
giant, graceful birds. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom and Ginny Chester, also of the Audubon Society, helped negotiate the East 
Orange General Plan, which was approved by the Orange City Council in December, 
so that the Irvine Co.'s development plans would not endanger the heron. 
</P>
<P>
At Bloom's suggestion, the company agreed to relocate two housing tracts and 
preserve 200 acres of wild oak groves near the proposed Limestone Canyon 
Regional Park. It also agreed to a five-year study and relocation plan for a 
colony of great blue herons that nest on the north shore of the lake where the 
company wants to build a road. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 pairs of herons nest in sycamore and oak trees along the shore of the 
Irvine Lake, also known as Santiago Reservoir. The Irvine Co. has agreed to 
either get the birds to move to new nests or abandon its plans to build a road 
there, said Lee Jones, resource specialist for Michael Brandman Associates, 
which prepared the environmental impact report for the development. 
</P>
<P>
In the study, biologists will determine where the herons eat, how many are 
breeding successfully and where they go in the winter. They will also 
coordinate the study with the federal Fish and Wildlife Service and the state 
Department of Fish and Game, Jones said. Leg bands will be placed on the young 
birds to keep track of them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After studying the birds, the biologists hope to encourage the herons to nest 
somewhere else, either along the southwest edge of the lake, on an island in 
the lake or elsewhere in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, herons are found along the Santa Ana River, Bolsa Chica 
Reserve, Upper Newport Bay, San Joaquin Marsh, Anaheim Lake and Dana Point 
Harbor. Bloom said the Irvine Lake rookery is the largest in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said the relocation program might include the planting of vegetation at 
other sites and the use of nesting platforms or heron decoys to encourage the 
birds to breed elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
After monitoring the new nesting site for three years and conducting annual 
counts of the breeding colonies, biologists will decide whether they can 
develop in the area without damaging the heron colony. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between the Audubon Society and the Irvine Co., the road 
could be built if at least 50% of the birds from the Irvine Lake rookery are 
nesting elsewhere. If not, the company could continue the relocation program or 
abandon its plans to build the road. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Irvine Co. does this right, meaning funding the study properly, this 
could be a one-of-a-kind study," Bloom said. Not much is known about the habits 
of great blue herons, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Adult great blue herons stand three to four feet high, with a wing span of 
about six feet. Sometimes mistaken for cranes, herons can be distinguished from 
other birds by the U-shape of their neck in flight. 
</P>
<P>
Although they were hunted for their colorful blue-gray plumage earlier in the 
century, great blue herons are not now listed as endangered or threatened. But 
biologists say that development has reduced the habitat of herons, putting them 
at risk. SHANNON SANDS

COUGAR POPULATION APPEARS STABLE

<P>
Orange County's mountain lions, faced with encroachment by housing development 
and highways, have so far held on, actually managing to carve a wild niche in 
an increasingly urban environment. 
</P>
<P>
Three new litters this year have added to a population of about 35 of the 
pale-brown hunters, and though several of the cubs have probably died young, 
researchers say the lion population appears stable, at least for the time 
being. These days, lion sightings in the county are not uncommon, with at least 
two unconfirmed reports a month, according to Tim Miller, manager of the 
county's regional parks. 
</P>
<P>
But the lions' habitat is fast disappearing, and experts fear that their time 
in Orange County could soon end unless action is taken to buffer them from 
people. 
</P>
<P>
One proposal to protect those habitats will go before California voters in 
June, and would set aside $30 million a year to protect habitats, $10 million 
of which would be targeted toward deer and lion areas. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would also permanently ban sport hunting of mountain lions, but 
wildlife experts are unconvinced that the ban is needed. Mountain lions, also 
known as cougars or pumas, are not endangered, and in fact have staged a 
decade-long comeback in California, rebounding from a population of less than 
1,000 in the early 1970s to between 2,500 and 6,000 today, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no biological justification for the hunting ban," said Paul Beier, 
project director of an Orange County mountain lion study that has collared and 
tracked cougars in the county since 1986, when, in separate incidents, two 
children were attacked and mauled by lions at Ronald W. Caspers Wilderness 
Park, near San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
During that study, nine lions have been collared, and seven currently carry the 
radio transmitters. Using those devices to track and map the cougars, Beier and 
his colleagues have been able to determine that they range over wide areas in 
and around Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Each of four females living near Caspers Park, for instance, has established a 
"home range" of up to 77 square miles, traveling mainly along canyon bottoms 
and hunting deer mostly at night. 
</P>
<P>
Although the lions do not seek contact with humans and attacks are rare, the 
crush of civilization brings lions and people ever closer. That worries some 
experts, who hope to save the lions and protect humans at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question but that conflicts are going to occur," Miller said. 
"We've got all these young kittens out there, and the growth is, of course, 
continuing. We're concerned. That's why we're studying the lions very 
carefully." JIM NEWTON

PEOPLE: TRUMPETER SPREADS THE JOY OF MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Douglas Thompson has spent most his life playing music for the love of it. 
</P>
<P>
Financially, "I'm not doing too bad, but then again I'm not doing too great," 
said Thompson, who favors the trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
Many times, "When I'm at a low ebb, I've had to find jobs outside music to 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach resident decided at age 21 to become a professional 
entertainer. Later he wanted to be a professional trumpet player. He finally 
settled on being a band leader and director. 
</P>
<P>
While he currently works in customer relations at a car agency, Thompson is the 
director of the Businessman's Band, although not all the players are 
businessmen. In fact, the band has had several names including Music Man's 
Band, Fountain Valley Community Band and Band X. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Thompson went to Washington as a member of what he said was the 
world's largest non-marching marching band. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't march, we just played march music," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a lot of joy working with my music and with people in music," said 
trumpeter Thompson, who sometimes switches to piano, trombone or drums. "I've 
always said if you do music for the money in it, then you're not doing music." 
</P>
<P>
Added Thompson: "In fact, serious musicians are strictly in it for the 
creativity, love and sharing of music and that's the 100% feeling most of us 
have." 
</P>
<P>
But while there is love for music, "a musician has to keep his financial life 
on an even keel and that's why I have to take a number of different jobs," he 
continued. "It goes with being a musician." 
</P>
<P>
And he knows of what he speaks. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in college (Cal State Los Angeles) I titled my term paper "Earning 
a Living as a Musician," which he said addressed the problem of keeping body 
and soul together while being an artist. 
</P>
<P>
He also attended Orange Coast College and Huntington Beach High School. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Thompson is attempting to develop a 200-member community band that 
he hopes will consist mainly of businessmen, but that is open to "anyone who 
can read music and play," as he put it. 
</P>
<P>
The current 32-member band rehearses Thursday nights at Costa Mesa High School 
and plays at Orange Coast College football and basketball games as well as 
other community functions. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who once was assistant director of a U.S. Army band in West Germany, 
complains about the small number of community bands in Orange County as well as 
the limited number of places for adults to learn and perform music. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to see a complete dry-up in community performing arts training," 
moaned the one-time church choir singer who said he was part of 13 performing 
arts groups when he was 17. 
</P>
<P>
After his Army discharge, Thompson went to Sacramento in hopes of persuading 
lobbyists and legislators to push for more funding for the performing arts. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't a whole lot of performing arts training going on and the future 
of musicians was at stake," he said. "It was difficult getting the attention of 
the right people." 
</P>
<P>
But later, besides his work with community bands and orchestras, he also got 
the attention of Boy Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1974 we formed Band Explorer Post 808," said Thompson, who was the post 
leader. "The Boy Scout Council said it was the first (such band) ever formed in 
the western half of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Some scoundrel stole the American flag from the Garden Grove home of Lu and 
Paul Bole, who have flown the flag atop a 25-foot pole 24 hours a day for the 
past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Word about the theft reached Mac McCullock, Americanism co-chairman for the 
Garden Grove Elks Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
Within a day he presented the couple with a flag that had been flown over the 
Capitol in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Flying the American Flag is an important part of the Elks Americanism 
program," he said.

PACIFIC STORM BRINGS AREA CHANCE OF RAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small Pacific storm will bring cloudy skies and a 50% chance of showers to 
Orange County today, but provide little relief from the drought, the National 
Weather Service predicted Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a small system moving through. However, it is not going to give us 
what we need," a weather service spokesman said. "This certainly won't affect 
the drought. We could catch up later this year, you never know." 
</P>
<P>
The front moving through Southern California this morning could bring a 
quarter-inch of rain along the coast and one-half to three-fourths of an inch 
in the mountain areas. Snow is predicted above 5,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
As the front moves east into the deserts, forecasters say, the chance of 
showers will diminish from 50% to 30%, leaving partly cloudy skies tonight. 
Clear, cool and windy weather is expected Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lows will be in the upper 40s except for some inland valleys, which could get 
temperatures as low as 35. Highs will be in the low 60s. Winds up to 15 m.p.h. 
will come out of the south and shift to west-to-northwest with velocities of 20 
to 30 m.p.h. by this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, a low-pressure system stretched along the East Coast from Canada 
through New York, New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania and Maryland into Virginia, 
bringing rain and raising temperatures into the 40s and 50s. Intermittent rain 
and fog clouded parts of the Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
Light snow and freezing rain made end-of-the-holiday traveling hazardous in the 
Great Lakes region, the upper Ohio Valley and parts of the northern Atlantic 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
A cold front brought rain to much of the South, where temperatures were 
generally mild. Meanwhile, a dry air mass covering much of New Mexico, 
Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana drove temperatures down overnight 
Sunday and early Monday, to the teens in the Texas Panhandle and the 40s in the 
Rio Grande Valley.

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: CROOKS' VALUE TO EDISON CAN BE FOUND OFF THE BOARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Talia Crooks wasn't named the most valuable player of last week's Marina girls' 
basketball tournament, but her value to the Edison High School girls' 
basketball team was all too evident. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Coach Philip Abraham. 
</P>
<P>
"(Tournament MVP) Debbie Fischer has been stealing the limelight, but Talia is 
the reason we are able to play teams with big posts," Abraham said. 
</P>
<P>
From pillar to post, Crooks, the Times' Athlete of the Week, had her way last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Crooks, 5-feet-9 and 140 pounds, is averaging 11 rebounds and 12 points this 
season. She had 44 rebounds and 47 points in four games of the Marina 
tournament as Edison (9-2) upset Ocean View, 58-53, in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
"Talia is really quick and she uses that," Abraham said. "She's thin but 
muscular. 
</P>
<P>
"Laura Finch and Talia set solid screens and they are really good at rolling to 
the hoop." 
</P>
<P>
Crooks is not Edison's primary offensive threat. 
</P>
<P>
"Talia gets most of her points off of rebounds and post moves," Abraham said. 
"She has a good sense for the ball and tremendous timing, which is so important 
for rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a great volleyball player and that helps with timing." 
</P>
<P>
Crooks agrees. "I think volleyball has helped. I'm not that great a jumper but 
I work at it," she said. "In volleyball you learn to jump with the timing of 
the set ball, so I guess I'm used to it (timing rebounds)." 
</P>
<P>
Hard work and concentration also help hone rebounding skills, and Crooks posts 
high marks in those areas too. 
</P>
<P>
She had 11 rebounds against Lakewood's front line of three 6-footers in 
Edison's 56-54 victory last week. That takes a little more effort for a 5-9 
player than letting the ball bounce into her hands. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't just 6-footers," Abraham said. "They were all legitimately good 
players. But Talia's presence is constantly felt on the floor. She plays clean 
and always plays very hard." 
</P>
<P>
And Crooks doesn't care how tall the opposition is.

"They don't intimidate me just because they're taller," Crooks said. "The first 
thing I look for is to rebound. I hurry to get position and screen out. We're a 
running team, so usually the tall girls are slower and don't keep up."

BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: WHITLOCK GIVES LOARA MORE THAN A SHOT IN THE ARM 
</P>

<P>
Two things could be predicted about the Loara High School basketball team the 
last two seasons: Tes Whitlock would score a lot and the Saxons would lose a 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman, Whitlock averaged about 15 points a game and Loara won five only 
games. Last year as a sophomore, he averaged 22.7 and the Saxons won four. 
</P>
<P>
This season, there has been quite a turnaround. Whitlock is averaging 30.8 
points, but the Saxons are 11-0. 
</P>
<P>
It's the Saxons' best start in the history of the school and the most games 
they have won in a season since 1978, also the last time they qualified for the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"If I didn't score 28 (last year) we weren't even close," Whitlock said. "This 
year I can score 14 and we can still win." 
</P>
<P>
That hasn't happened often this season for Whitlock, the Times' Athlete of the 
Week. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, he scored 40 points, including 17 of the team's 19 first-quarter 
points, in Loara's 70-65 victory over Pacifica in the championship game of the 
Pacifica tournament. He also scored Loara's first 17 points, making his first 
seven shots. He made 14 of 20 shots in the game, missing only a dunk and five 
three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock, whose full first name is Monttes, scored 108 points in three 
tournament games and was named the most valuable player of the event. He also 
led Loara to the championship of the Garden Grove tournament earlier in the 
month and was named the MVP. 
</P>
<P>
But it's a mistake if opponents believe that they can stop the Saxons if they 
can stop Whitlock, said Coach Jerry Halpin, who is in his first season at 
Loara. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not just a Tes team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Though Whitlock scored 27 of Loara's 37 first-half points against Pacifica, the 
Saxons still trailed by five. It was only when other Loara players contributed 
that the game was turned around. Whitlock only scored 13 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Halpin said Whitlock, who moved with his family from Chattanooga, Tenn., before 
the seventh grade, has improved his perimeter shooting since last season when 
opponents would stop his drives and force him to shoot outside. 
</P>
<P>
"He's killing people who are doing that to him this year," Halpin said. 
</P>
<P>
But Whitlock, who is averaging 8.8 assists, isn't selfish, Halpin said. He only 
takes shots when he is open and there are no plays designed to get him the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I get a lot of individual attention, but the team knows I'm with them," 
Whitlock said. "It's not just me. We won two tournaments together." 
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Guard Augustin Heredia of Estancia averaged 21 points in four games to lead the 
Eagles to third place in their tournament. Heredia scored 26 points on Saturday 
as Estancia defeated Los Alamitos, 79-60. 
</P>
<P>
Cherokee Parks averaged 26 points and 12 rebounds for Marina in the Orange 
tournament. Wednesday, he had 37 points and 19 rebounds, making 14 of 15 field 
goals in an 82-71 overtime victory over El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda's Keith Walker set a school record on Saturday by making 26 of 28 
free throws as he scored 47 points in the Wildcats' 84-53 championship victory 
over Compton in the Brea-Olinda tournament. Walker also had 16 rebounds and six 
assists before fouling out with a minute to play.

RAM NOTEBOOK;

IF GIANTS ARE LOOKING FOR HELP, THEY WON'T GET IT FROM MEDIA

<P>
If the Rams adhered to Buddy Ryan's pregame philosophy, they'd already be 
sinking their teeth into the New York Giants, this Sunday's NFC divisional 
playoff game opponent at the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Taylor? That wimp? The same All-Pro linebacker who was held to two 
excuse-me tackles and no sacks in the Rams' 31-10 thrashing of the Giants in 
November? What's this washout doing on a playoff team? 
</P>
<P>
No such bulletin-board luck for the Giants. The Rams know better, having just 
wiped a week's worth of juiced-up quotes in the face of Ryan's Philadelphia 
Eagles in the form of a 21-7 wild-card victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams will make it a point to low-key their approach against the Giants, 
despite having dominated the NFC East champions the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1988, quarterback Jim Everett tossed five touchdown passes in the 
Rams' 45-31 win over the Giants in the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
Last Nov. 12, at Anaheim Stadium, the Rams flattened the Giants, 31-10, in a 
game they led, 31-3, at one point in the fourth quarter. New York shared the 
NFC's best record entering the game at 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants have sacked Everett just once in the two meetings. Ram left tackle 
Irv Pankey seems to have what it takes to stop Taylor, who was invisible in the 
November game, drawing public address attention only for two penalties called 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams match up well against the Giants across the board. 
</P>
<P>
You could say the Rams had the Giants' number, but the Rams wouldn't dare. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had a chance to play them in the playoffs yet," Everett said. 
"There's no doubt we think they're a good football team. It'll probably be much 
different. They wouldn't have the record they have if they're not a good 
football team." 
</P>
<P>
What kind of game does tailback Greg Bell think it's going to be? Another rout 
like the previous two? Bite your tongue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a very physical game," Bell said. "We know each other, we've 
been fortunate to come out the victors the last two times we met. I know we're 
going to approach the game the same way we approached this one (against 
Philadelphia). It's going to be a dogfight and it's going to last until there's 
one second left on the clock. If we're in control of the ball, the last five 
minutes, we're going to run the clock out." 
</P>
<P>
Bad question/good answer: Everett, who has passed for 8,274 yards and 60 
touchdowns the past two seasons, was asked after Sunday's game if he felt he is 
starting to arrive as an NFL quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I arriving?" Everett responded. "I hate that question. You guys be the 
judge." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Everett feels that he hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I base my arriving on something that has to do with the (Super)Dome this 
year," he said. "My judgment of what a quarterback is, is one who wins the 
Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
After 14 seasons in the league, Ram offensive tackle Jackie Slater has seen it 
all. Oh, really? 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't gotten to the point where I think I know it all," he said. "All you 
have to do is go out to practice and have some of these youngsters beat you. 
It's a humbling enough experience. My position is one where you've constantly 
got to work to stay good at it, otherwise you get dominated." 
</P>
<P>
Slater proved again Sunday that he's still good enough. He limited Eagles' 
All-Pro defensive end Reggie White to one sack. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't getting any easier, though. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys like Reggie White and Bruce Smith keep popping up," he said. "They get 
bigger, faster and stronger. They're guys that can dominate. I hate to think 
how big and fast offensive and defensive linemen are eventually going to get." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's win over Philadelphia was the Rams' first playoff win since they 
defeated the Dallas Cowboys, 20-0, in a first-round divisional game in 1985. It 
was team's first wild-card win since a win over Dallas in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been awhile," Pankey said. "I think everybody believes. We've been 
through our four-week stretch where we lost games in the last 28 seconds. We've 
been to the down side." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' all-linebacker pass rush team of Kevin Greene, Brett Faryniarz, 
George Bethune and Fred Strickland averages 244 pounds per man if you believe 
the team's current weight listings. Don't believe them. The average is closer 
to 235 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Any more questions about the Rams being wimps in cold weather? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how many times you have to play in bad weather to become a 
bad-weather team," guard Tom Newberry said after consecutive wins at New 
England and Philadelphia, both games played in less-than-desirable conditions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE RAMS BY THE NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
Highlight 
</P>
<P>
JACKIE SLATER 
</P>
<P>
No one, least of all the loud-mouthed Philadelphia Eagles, had to tell this 
14-year pro that he and his mates had to provide maximum protection for 
quarterback Jim Everett if the Rams were to win Sunday's NFC wild-card game. In 
Reggie White and Jerome Brown, the Eagles have two of the league's premier pass 
rushers. So, Slater and his offensive line mates responded with one of their 
finest efforts of the season, not only limiting the Giants to two sacks but 
giving Everett sufficient time to complete 18 of 33 passes for 265 yards and 
two touchdowns.

<TEXT>
<P>
It's an uncommonly balmy October evening here at the exclusive Woodholme 
Country Club. Guests nibble imported crackers laced with Russian caviar. The 
Dom Perignon flows. Mock cheerleaders greet guests at the door, begging for 
autographs. 
</P>
<P>
A raspy-voiced, slightly crazed Wolfman Jack imitator emcees the proceedings; 
the Vandellas and the Shirelles are belting out '50s tunes. The host, Harold 
Goldsmith, is hanging out near the bandstand. 
</P>
<P>
This is a 10th anniversary party celebrating a decade of wedded bliss for 
Goldsmith and his second wife, Beth. But it could just as easily be a class 
reunion for a group of kids from Northwest Baltimore who grew up to find fame 
and fortune in business, entertainment and politics. 
</P>
<P>
The group -- which included Goldsmith; his business partner, Leonard (Boogie) 
Weinglass, and film director Barry Levinson -- spent much of the early 1960s 
hanging out at the Hilltop Diner on Reisterstown Road. That eatery, and the 
young men who met there, eventually became the inspiration for the film 
"Diner," Levinson's highly acclaimed film about rites of passage. 
</P>
<P>
It was somehow fitting that this bash, attended by so many former "Diner" guys, 
was being hosted by Goldsmith, the chairman and brains behind the $400-million 
Merry-Go-Round clothing chain and, by his own design, perhaps the group's 
least-known and most successful member. 
</P>
<P>
His financial and real estate acumen turned a handful of downtown row houses -- 
the first of which he got as a bar mitzvah gift -- into a banking and retail 
empire. And Goldsmith, a millionaire many times over at 47, apparently thinks 
there is a lot more where that came from. 
</P>
<P>
He holds stakes in several Baltimore-Washington-area thrifts and last year 
waged a protracted, unsuccessful bid for control of Arlington, Va.-based 
Columbia First Federal Savings and Loan Assn. Ultimately, associates say, he is 
angling to build a financial empire spanning Maryland, Virginia and the 
District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
"Other guys have hobbies; Harold makes money," says Larry Oberfeld, a friend 
since junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith has already profited handsomely on Merry-Go-Round. Its initial stock 
offering in July, 1983, netted him $13 million; he walked away with another $16 
million in a secondary offering this fall. 
</P>
<P>
And he still owns a sizable piece of the retail chain, about 19%. The stock 
closed recently at $18.50 a share, making his stake worth about $36 million. He 
also holds most of the stock of Eastern Savings Bank, a privately held 
Baltimore thrift he bought in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and associates figure he is worth about $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Harold always wanted to be rich. It's been a real driving force in his life," 
says Weinglass, the MGR vice chairman and a longtime friend. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith is a member of an elite corporate fraternity, a gifted few for whom 
success has come with astonishing speed. Says longtime buddy Levinson: "Harold 
was one of those 'most-likely-to' guys, the sort who would do well in 
business." 
</P>
<P>
A Lincolnesque countenance, prominent nose and dark curly hair make Goldsmith 
look more like a scientist than crackerjack financier. He does not care much 
for the trappings of success, and he buys his clothes off the rack. 
</P>
<P>
People who know him invariably describe Goldsmith as intelligent, focused and 
above all intense, whether it is adding a new filly to his stable of businesses 
or devoting an hour to lifting weights. 
</P>
<P>
Says Barry Stern, a childhood friend who runs a Washington development firm: 
"If Harold decides to work out from 1 to 2 and you call him at 1:30, you can 
forget it." 
</P>
<P>
For a man so well-known in business circles, though, Goldsmith is private, 
intensely so. In more than a decade as president of publicly held 
Merry-Go-Round, he never granted an interview. 
</P>
<P>
His aversion to publicity is only one facet of a complex, contradictory 
personality. His 7,000-square-foot hilltop mansion is filled with personal 
treasures amassed over the years, among them fine Persian rugs and an antique 
mahogany Steinway. But it is empty most of the time: He lives mostly in Aspen, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
He eschews public displays of affection, swears liberally and can be downright 
ornery at times, yet he is generous almost to the point of eccentricity. He was 
once so wowed by some design work done by Trahan Burden &amp; Charles that he 
sent the advertising agency more money than the contract called for. "It was 
the only time a client ever said we didn't charge them enough," recalls 
principal Allan Charles. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Goldsmith and his older sister, Ilene, grew up in a modest home above 
their father's grocery store in East Baltimore. Childhood friends remember the 
family as a close-knit one that stressed the traditional values of education 
and hard work. His father, a great believer in moving up in the world, bought 
real estate on the side. 
</P>
<P>
A gifted student, young Harold skipped a couple of grades and, as a result, 
often hung around with peers a couple of years older than he was. In junior 
high school, he met the buddies that would later become the "Diner" crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Even then, the gaunt, bespectacled kid had a reputation for smarts and an 
amazing dexterity with numbers. Chip Silverman, a member of the group and 
author of "Diner Guys," a book that follows the characters of "Diner" through 
four decades, remembers Harold winning many a late-night bet with his ability 
to add numbers in his head. 
</P>
<P>
He was also known for dropping liars in their tracks, friends recall. Guys 
would come into the diner boasting of their accomplishments in sports or with 
girls. Harold would cross-examine them so skillfully that people started 
checking to see whether he was around before spinning tall tales. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith enrolled at the University of Maryland, where he majored in English 
literature. Associates say he could have graduated at 19 but dropped out a 
couple of semesters shy of that to go into his father's real estate business. 
According to Silverman's book, he eventually completed his education and 
returned to the family's real estate business. A few years later, he went into 
business with old friend Stern. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Weinglass was trying his hand in the retail business. In 1968, he 
and a partner put up $750 apiece and bought a supply of jeans and other 
counterculture gear in New York. They rented a place on Atlanta's Peachtree 
Street and called it Merry-Go-Round. To get publicity, they pulled such 
outrageous stunts as dressing in drag or giving free clothes to the fifth 
Oriental or seventh black person to cross the threshold. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years later, Goldsmith called Weinglass for advice on opening his 
own shop in Baltimore and ended up making his old friend an offer: half his 
real estate for a 50% stake in Merry-Go-Round. 
</P>
<P>
Whether he plans to make a run at another thrift remains to be seen. But he has 
apparently shaken up the management of at least one of the companies in which 
he owns shares. Maryland Federal Savings &amp; Loan of Hyattsville, a 
profitable, 15-branch thrift in which he acquired a 5.2% stake, hastily called 
a special stockholders meeting in September and adopted defensive measures 
against a hostile takeover. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever moves Goldsmith makes to build a regional financial empire, he 
will be making them from a distance. A couple of years ago, Goldsmith moved 
from Baltimore to Aspen in an attempt to slow down. Has it worked? Well, not 
exactly. These days he talks about business deals while hiking mountain trails. 
</P>
<P>
Is Harold Goldsmith really out to create an S&amp;L empire? Only time will 
tell. But based on his successes, a lot of people can see it happening. "I 
think he could visualize owning a group of thrifts," Stern says. "Harold's the 
kind of guy who makes things happen."

SHAMIR RETREATS, ENDING CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
WON'T FIRE SCIENCE MINISTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

JERUSALEM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defusing a political crisis that threatened the coalition government, Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir today canceled his decision to fire Science Minister 
Ezer Weizman for alleged contacts with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
In a political compromise, Weizman agreed to quit the decision-making inner 
Cabinet. The announcement came after Shamir summoned Weizman today. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between Weizman and Shamir ended two days of intense efforts to 
save the coalition of the conservative Likud bloc that Shamir heads and the 
center-left Labor Party of which Weizman is a senior member. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis was the worst to shake a Likud-Labor alliance in six years and 
concerned a major issue that has split the nation -- how to resolve Israel's 
festering conflict with Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Shamir gave Weizman written notice that he was fired as of today 
because of contacts with the PLO in which Weizman allegedly divulged secret 
Israeli strategy that he learned in meetings of the 12-member inner Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Weizman told reporters after the five-minute meeting that Shamir had not 
confronted him with evidence of the PLO contacts. 
</P>
<P>
"Firstly, the crisis is over. Secondly, all attempts to say I am guilty or not 
I don't accept because for me guilt is a matter of being brought to court or 
not," Weizman told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Weizman, 65, a former defense minister who defected from Likud, said Shamir 
took back the dismissal letter. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement was worked out before the meeting and finalized in Shamir's 
office "with smiles and a handshake," Weizman said, adding he will go ahead 
with a planned trip to Moscow on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise, Weizman will remain science minister in the overall, 
26-member Cabinet but will no longer sit in sessions of the inner Cabinet, 
where government strategy is decided. 
</P>
<P>
Eliakim Rubinstein, the Cabinet secretary and a top Shamir aide, said Shamir 
will consider restoring Weizman to the inner Cabinet in 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister stressed to Mr. Weizman the seriousness with which he 
viewed all contacts with terrorist organizations, leading them the PLO," 
Rubinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Labor had demanded that Weizman not be ousted without a chance to see and 
respond to evidence against him. Labor leaders were split, however, over how 
far to go in defending Weizman, who has openly advocated talks with the PLO 
despite government policy against any dealings with the organization. 
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, Iraq, a Palestine Liberation Organization official said Shamir had 
sent a message to PLO leader Yasser Arafat a few months ago on a possible 
settlement of the Mideast crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder why Shamir is making a lot of noise about Weizman's contacts with the 
PLO when he and other senior Israeli politicians made similar contacts," said 
Bassam Abu Sharif, Arafat's political adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Abu Sharif, who is known to have contacted Israeli officials on behalf of the 
PLO, declined to reveal the precise contents of the message or say who was the 
intermediary.

GOLDEN STATE FREEWAY BESET BY SNOW AND ICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rain, snow and ice combined to create numerous traffic problems and accidents 
this morning but no serious injuries in northern Los Angeles County, the 
California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
Overnight snow and ice slowed traffic on the Golden State Freeway near Gorman 
during the morning commute, and at least 12 accidents occurred between 7 and 9 
a.m., said CHP Lt. Bob Caldwell. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a pretty good snow -- a couple inches," said Caldwell, who was 
heading Operation Snowflake, in which CHP cruisers escort motorists on the 
freeway at safe speeds. "We haven't had any serious accidents. Mostly spin-outs 
and people off to the side." 
</P>
<P>
Caldwell said nine California Department of Transportation trucks were plowing 
the snow and dropping sand on a 15-mile stretch of the freeway. He said four 
lanes remained open to traffic but the going was slow. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the morning, rain caused accidents that forced the closure of the 
truck lanes of the Golden State and Foothill freeways near Sylmar for about 
four hours. 
</P>
<P>
A northbound truck pulling a double set of trailers jackknifed in the rain and 
the rear trailer overturned about midnight near the interchange of the two 
freeways, CHP spokesman Ralph Elvira said. Two other big-rig trucks skidded off 
the freeway nearby a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
The northbound and westbound truck lanes were closed in the area for about four 
hours while the trucks were cleared -- an operation slowed because the 
overturned trailer was loaded with household chemicals that had to be unloaded 
before the trailer was righted.

<P>
A fire in the offices of a Granada Hills school caused an estimated $150,000 in 
damages this morning but did not delay classes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported at 4:20 a.m. at Porter Junior High School and quickly 
extinguished by about 20 firefighters, said Los Angeles Fire Department 
spokesman Pat Marek. There were no injuries and the cause of the blaze was 
still under investigation, Marek said. 
</P>
<P>
A water main at the school burst after the fire was out and flooded several 
offices, said Rich Mendoza, school plant manager. 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza said that although water and fire damage to the office complex at the 
school was extensive, no classrooms were damaged; classes proceeded this 
morning as scheduled.

L.A. GETS HALF INCH, FIRST RAIN SINCE THANKSGIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The luscious clouds that delivered up almost half an inch of rain to Los 
Angeles and several inches of snow to the mountains have moved on, leaving but 
a 20% chance of rain for the rest of the day and a windy day Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The post-midnight thunder and lightning storm provided the first rain since 
Thanksgiving, but it left the region still three inches below normal for the 
season -- normal being about 4.5 inches, said a National Weather Service 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a lot more of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Snow in the mountains was enough to close schools in the Rim of the World 
School District in Running Springs near Lake Arrowhead. Four or five inches of 
snow fell there and at Big Bear, according to the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
For the second time in five days, snow chains were required but only on the 
roads above 6,500 feet, such as those going into the Big Bear area, said CHP 
Officer D. A. Walker. "The holidays are over; we're not getting that much 
traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Although lows will be lower tonight -- in the low to mid-40s -- highs will be 
higher, reaching well into the 60s, according to the Weather Service.

Romania's new deputy foreign minister has died of a stroke, a government member 
said today. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
Corneliu Bogdan died late Monday, said Sergiu Nicolaescu, a film director and 
member of the National Salvation Front leadership that has sought to run the 
country since the hated dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was deposed. 
</P>
<P>
Bogdan served as Romanian ambassador to the United States from 1969 through 
1977. He returned to Bucharest and was out of government for a time but later 
was named to a post in the Foreign Ministry that gave him authority over 
Western Hemisphere relations. Bogdan's stepdaughter, Svetlana Hoge, said there 
was friction between her father and the government of Ceausescu and that he 
again left the ministry and was placed under what amounted to house arrest. She 
said he was allowed to travel to Washington in 1988 on a Woodrow Wilson 
Fellowship and that he remained in the United States until a month ago.

CONGRESSMAN CONVICTED IN WEDTECH CASE QUITS

<P>
Rep. Robert Garcia, the Bronx Democrat convicted with his wife last year in the 
Wedtech scandal, announced today he is resigning from the congressional seat he 
has held for more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who was the first Puerto Rican member of Congress, said in a statement 
that he will officially step down Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It is with deep sadness that I announce my resignation from the United States 
Congress," said the 56-year-old politician who earned a reputation as a 
national Latino leader by fighting for his constituents in one of the poorest 
districts in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of the Bronx have always been the most important part of my life 
and representing them is the greatest honor I could ever know," the statement 
said. "But I have always said that, if I could not serve their best interests, 
I would leave office. That time has come." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia and his wife, Jane Lee, 48, were convicted Oct. 20 of conspiracy and 
extortion for their part in the Wedtech scandal. Both face up to 45 years in 
prison and $750,000 in fines when they are sentenced Jan. 19 by Judge Leonard 
Sand in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
The couple were found guilty of taking tens of thousands of dollars in illegal 
payments, loans and jewelry from the now-defunct Wedtech Corp., a small Bronx 
machine shop that blossomed into a major government and defense contractor, 
allegedly by bribing influential officials. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's attorneys have said they plan to appeal their convictions. 
</P>
<P>
The Garcias' trial was the last major case to grow out of the Wedtech scandal, 
which ruined the careers of several Bronx politicians, including 10-term Rep. 
Mario Biaggi. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said he is timing his resignation to allow New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo 
to call for a special election to fill out the remaining year of his term. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of Democrats have already lined up to seek the post, but Bronx 
Democratic leaders have privately suggested state Assemblyman Jose Serrano is 
Garcia's likely successor. The district is overwhelmingly Democratic, and 
whoever gets the party's endorsement would be a clear front-runner.

BERLIN WALL WILL BE PULLED DOWN, EAST GERMAN TELLS HAVEL

<TEXT>
<P>
The Berlin Wall, which symbolized the schism between Eastern and Western Europe 
for 28 years, will be pulled down, an East German official said today in a 
dramatic demonstration of the liberalization of the East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
East German head of state Manfred Gerlach told visiting Czechoslovak President 
Vaclav Havel that the wall will be torn down. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pulling down the wall. It has become superfluous. It will be replaced 
by normal border markings," Gerlach said in the interview with the West German 
daily, Bild. 
</P>
<P>
Gerlach said that no date has been set for the wall's removal but that the East 
German government would discuss it soon. 
</P>
<P>
Bild said it interviewed him after he had taken Havel to see the wall and the 
historic Brandenburg Gate today. 
</P>
<P>
Havel told reporters that he was amazed that the wall, built in 1961 and a 
symbol of Germany's and Europe's division until East Germany opened its borders 
in November, is still standing. 
</P>
<P>
"Gerlach told me work would soon start to tear it down. I told him if he had 
any problems we could send some independent Czechoslovak workers to help free 
of charge," he said to loud applause. 
</P>
<P>
Havel also told journalists he would like to say "Ich bin ein Berliner" -- "I 
am a Berliner" -- as did President John F. Kennedy during his visit to Berlin 
in June, 1963, two years after the wall was built. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to take the liberty to repeat this sentence at a new time and in 
a new context," Havel said. 
</P>
<P>
He said all walls and barriers in Europe must fall. 
</P>
<P>
Built by Soviet-backed East German troops Aug. 13, 1961, the wall was first 
breached last Nov. 9 as East German authorities were moving away from the 
Stalinist policies that had been their trademark for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Havel visited the East German capital briefly before seeing West German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Munich, his first official visits since he was 
elected president Friday as part of an agreement among the Czechoslovak 
government, opposition groups and the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
His trips to the Germanys ahead of one to the Soviet Union reflected a shift in 
Czechoslovakia's foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Havel said his visits originally were to be symbolic but turned out to be 
"working visits." 
</P>
<P>
"We managed to discuss many concrete issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to a question, Havel said he is opposed to the death penalty but he 
said last week's execution of Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife 
may have saved many lives. 
</P>
<P>
After talks with Gerlach and Prime Minister Hans Modrow, Havel praised recent 
developments in East Germany, which has moved away from the Stalinist policies 
it had adhered to since its founding 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us Europeans must thank the GDR (East Germany) for having started 
pulling down one of the worst walls," said Havel, a playwright and essayist, 
who gained prominence during the spring 1968 uprising in Prague that was 
crushed by Warsaw Pact tanks. 
</P>
<P>
"This decade must become the decade of Europeans," said Kohl after meeting with 
Havel in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
The Czechoslovakian leader also met with West German Foreign Minister 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, President Richard von Weizsaecker and opposition leader 
Hans-Jochen Vogel. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, who was jailed for five years for his opposition to the Communist 
authorities, was awarded the annual Peace Prize of the Frankfurt Book Fair last 
year. The Czechoslovakian government had prevented his traveling to West 
Germany to collect the award. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Havel declared a New Year's amnesty for common criminals and said his 
biggest task is to lead Czechoslovakia toward free elections without violence. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovak Justice Minister Dagmar Buresova said in a radio address that the 
amnesty will be extensive because many prisoners are serving excessively harsh 
sentences. But she said corrupt public officials will be excluded from the 
amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear how many prisoners will be affected by the 
amnesty.

CONSTRUCTION SPENDING AT 10-MONTH HIGH

Construction spending jumped 1.5% in November, rebounding from a 0.1% decrease 
in October and reaching a 10-month high, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and government 
construction spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $421.7 
billion in November. 
</P>
<P>
It was the highest level of spending since last January's $423-billion rate. 
</P>
<P>
Total spending in October was revised downward from the 1% increase reported 
initially. 
</P>
<P>
The November surge was due to a 7% jump in government spending, which 
represents about 20% of construction spending, combined with a 0.6% gain in 
residential construction, which accounts for about 50% of the total. 
Non-residential spending was off 0.7%. 
</P>
<P>
Construction spending fell to a yearly low rate of $410.3 billion last July. It 
has been among the sectors of the economy hardest hit by higher interest rates 
earlier this year, brought about by the Federal Reserve Board's efforts to 
restrain inflation by tightening credit. 
</P>
<P>
But as inflation moderated, the Fed began last June to let short-term rates 
drop and analysts have been saying the lower rates should result in increased 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
Fixed-rate mortgages declined from a peak of 11.22% last March to 9.74% at the 
end of November, according to a weekly survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corp.

The price on the Sentra has been increased $100 and the prices for the Stanza

"The new prices, which represent an increase of approximately 1%, are the

"While this action is necessary, we are pleased to note that we are maintaining

BIG THREE'S SALES SLUMP 22% IN MID-DECEMBER FROM YEAR AGO

Sales of North American-made cars and light trucks by the Big Three slumped 22% 
in mid-December from a year earlier, when buyers rushed showrooms to take 
advantage of expiring incentives, the companies said today. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. reported that their 
vehicles sold at an average daily rate of 25,795 during the Dec. 11-20 period 
last year compared with a rate of 33,082 during the same time in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Car sales dropped 27.4%, while sales of light trucks fell 13.3%. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the Big Three had incentive programs in effect and set to expire 
Dec. 31. As a result, buyers headed to dealerships to cash in on specials at 
the year's end, normally a slow period for car and truck sales. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, consumers have become numbed by incentives, and the market has been 
saturated with new cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Big Three, Ford's mid-December combined car and truck sales dropped 
the most, falling 25.2% from a year ago. Chrysler's vehicle sales for 
mid-December were down 22.8% and GM's sales fell 19.5%.

DOW SOARS 56.95 TO ALL-TIME HIGH;

WALL STREET: INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE BREAKS THE 2,800 BARRIER FOR THE FIRST TIME.

<P>
Wall Street began the new year with a bang today, surging to the all-time 
closing high in the year's first session. 
</P>
<P>
A blue chip rally carried the Dow Jones industrial average up 56.95 points to 
2,810.15, it's first-ever close above the 2,800 mark. 
</P>
<P>
The closing high tops the previous Dow record close of 2,791.41 reached on Oct. 
9, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The rally was not linked to any specific news event but was instead viewed as 
enthusiastic start-of-the year buying of selected blue chips such as IBM, which 
led the market with a gain of 3 3/4 points to 98 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
The broader market also chalked up big gains, but volume was light as some 
traders took an extended New Year's holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks began the session by falling as traders nervously awaited the National 
Assn. of Purchasing Management monthly report on the manufacturing economy 
during December. 
</P>
<P>
But prices moved broadly higher when the association's survey of its members 
indicated that the industrial sector remained weak for the eighth straight 
month. Traders believe the Federal Reserve is more likely to nudge interest 
rates lower if the economy is slowing. 
</P>
<P>
Prices also were boosted as institutional investors, flush with cash after 
liquidating some of their holdings at year's end, began to pick up stocks, 
especially the blue chips. 
</P>
<P>
Program trading also added to the gains, especially in the last half-hour, when 
the Dow average surged more than 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
On the trading floor as of 3 p.m., Manufacturers Hanover was the most active 
NYSE issue, up sharply. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris followed, posting a gain. IBM was third, also sharply higher as 
the technology sector rebounded after a year-end slump. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other blue chips, AT&amp;T, General Electric, Eastman Kodak, 
Woolworth and International Paper all were higher. 
</P>
<P>
In the technology sector, Unisys was higher while Digital Equipment, Compaq and 
Hewlett-Packard rose sharply. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outdistanced decliners by a margin of about 3 to 1 on the New 
York Stock Exchange, with 1,254 stock rising, 404 falling and 333 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 162.07 million shares, against 145.94 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 2.95 to 197.99. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were mixed in early trading today as the market absorbed a new 
report on U.S. manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was down 1/32 point, or 31 cents 
for every $1,000 in face value, at around midday. Its yield was unchanged from 
Friday at 7.97%. 
</P>
<P>
The market was closed Monday for the New Years Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government 
issues were unchanged to 1/32 point higher, intermediate maturities had edged 
up 1/32 point to 1/16 point and long-term issues were unchanged to 1/16 point 
lower, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, was down 0.18 at 1,188.23. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8 7/16%, up from 7 1/2% on Friday.

'TANGO' DANCES TO TOP AS BOX OFFICE REBOUNDS

<P>
The Christmas box-office blues are over, with most of the season's top movies 
enjoying a huge leap in business during the New Year's Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"Tango &amp; Cash," Warner's Sylvester Stallone-Kurt Russell buddy movie, moved 
up 53% to top the chart with about $10.4 million, according to preliminary 
figures released today. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Danny De Vito's black comedy about divorce, "War of the Roses," 
jumped more than 140%, with roughly $10 million worth of tickets sold over the 
four-day weekend. And children flocked to see Disney's animated feature, "The 
Little Mermaid." 
</P>
<P>
Its early business may have been disappointing -- particularly considering the 
critical acclaim surrounding the old-fashioned fairy tale -- but ticket sales 
jumped nearly 200% over the weekend to nearly $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Universal's "Back to the Future II," which opened more than a month ago, also 
made a big comeback with more than $8 million in ticket sales, a 100% increase 
over the Christmas weekend. NINA J. EASTON

"When you look ethnic it's that much harder," he said. "Everyone is thin and

LIZ SMITH: BARR AND MADONNA WILL RIDE OUT THE STORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIZ SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROSEANNE BARR is a shooting star, one who many Hollywood observers believe is 
consistently shooting herself in the foot. I don't feel this is necessarily so, 
but it is true that Barr, who leaped from obscurity to superstardom in one 
year, is now too hot not to cool down. We are, in fact, experiencing a Roseanne 
backlash right this very moment, due to the failure of her first motion 
picture, "She-Devil" (critics and fans didn't think Roseanne was "funny" 
enough, completely missing the point of her role). 
</P>
<P>
This professional setback, coupled with the star's sometimes bizarre real-life 
behavior and increasingly sensational and unsavory press coverage, has fed the 
public's growing realization that Barr is not your typical, wacky, lovable 
comedienne. She's a deadly serious, admittedly neurotic, intelligent, testy 
woman. She has also become one of the most powerful women in show business, 
causing all the usual gripes about what a bitch she is for wanting control over 
her own creation and product, the ABC sitcom "Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
Sudden power and popularity have, naturally, wreaked havoc on Barr's private 
life (this almost always happens). Her longtime marriage fell apart, the 
daughter she gave up for adoption when she was a teen-ager was discovered by 
the National Enquirer and this painful episode had to be played out for an 
audience of millions. Most recently, Roseanne called off marriage plans, and 
her fiance, writer and comic Tom Arnold, entered a drug rehabilitation center. 
Nevertheless, all this sturm und drang aside, I believe Roseanne Barr is in for 
the long haul, as an actress, and in time, probably behind the scenes, 
producing and directing. Her private life (well, her public/private life) will 
continue to be fodder for gossip columns and tabloids, and that may be her most 
difficult adjustment. I do not see Roseanne as a flash in the pan. I do not see 
her disappearing. She will not go unnoticed in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
MADONNA MAY be the biggest movie star in the world. Despite the fact she's 
never starred in a major hit movie. And Madonna will remain "the biggest" even 
if her upcoming endeavor with Warren Beatty, "Dick Tracy," turns into another 
flop. 
</P>
<P>
The publicity, excitement and controversy that Madonna generates can only be 
compared to the great motion picture stars of previous generations. When her 
bomb "Who's That Girl?" opened in New York two years ago, Times Square was 
jammed with thousands of frenzied fans. She already has, due to her videos, a 
film image -- what she needs is a good movie. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Madonna is endlessly fascinating, and she has been since the moment she 
burst on the scene with her crucifixes, lace ankle socks, bustieres and that 
astonishing air of confidence, bordering on arrogance. And with what to back it 
all up? Her talents did not seem extraordinary. But Madonna kept pressing what 
was left of society's propriety buttons, both in her work and her real life, so 
that now who she is and all that that represents is far more important and 
interesting than what she actually does. (Though, as "Like a Prayer" 
demonstrated, what she does is also very interesting indeed!) 
</P>
<P>
As her own self, blonde or brunette, in Spandex or peasant skirt, looking like 
a goddess or a pizzeria waitress, she is bigger and more controversial than any 
project in which she becomes involved. (Remember how "Speed-The-Plow" became 
"Madonna's play"?) This kind of super-fame is a double-edged sword. Intense 
public interest assures her survival as a star and a commodity upon which 
Hollywood will continue to risk millions. 
</P>
<P>
Such white heat, however gets in the way of one's viewing her at all 
dispassionately -- as a serious artist (which she is. Take a look at her 
powerful "Oh, Father" video), or even as a human being. 
</P>
<P>
So Madonna, like Cher before her, will have to work hard for respect, for 
intelligent analysis of her work, and for the right movie roles that will 
finally put her over. And I see her political activism and influence growing, 
too. She will succeed brilliantly. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, there will be fallow periods to be sure. And spectacular comebacks -- de 
rigueur for a genuine article like Madonna. She was hot in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Now watch Madonna explode in the '90s.

Anabolic steroids may have a greater effect on the minds than the bodies of 
athletes trying to improve their performances, a British television documentary 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"QED: The Steroid Myth" presents evidence from the United States, Britain and 
Italy challenging the view that the physical effects alone of steroids can turn 
good athletes into world champions. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea that steroids enhance performance may be another damaging myth," the 
program, scheduled for airing Wednesday, concludes. 
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing today, the program's producer, Chris Thau, said the 
muscle-building powers attributed to steroids can help certain athletes at 
certain times.

The National Collegiate Athletic Assn. plans to move into its new headquarters 
in Overland Park, Kan., in February, but the visitors' center in the building 
won't be open until September, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The association's executives had hoped to announce the NCAA national basketball 
tournament pairings at the new visitors' center in March. But design of video 
displays and other items in the center have taken longer than expected, Rich 
Hunter, NCAA director of operations, said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a highly technical area," Hunter said. "There are going to be a lot of 
interactive computer videos. The design of those things and how they fit into 
the space is something that has delayed the opening."

MACLEOD WAITS FOR KINGS' CALL

Former Dallas Mavericks Coach John MacLeod said he is "just waiting" to hear 
from the Sacramento Kings, who reportedly narrowed their search for a new head 
coach to MacLeod and two others. 
</P>
<P>
MacLeod spent the last hours of 1989 trying to start 1990 with a job. 
</P>
<P>
He met Sunday with Kings officials in Sacramento to discuss the Kings' coaching 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
"I left the house at 5 a.m. and I got back home right at midnight," MacLeod 
told the Dallas Times Herald on Monday. "I spent the whole day going to 
Sacramento and back." 
</P>
<P>
MacLeod was the third person to interview formally for the position. Orlando 
Magic assistant Bob Weiss, a former Mavericks assistant, was interviewed on 
Thursday, and Golden State Warriors assistant Mike Schuler visited on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We had about a three-hour session and dinner," MacLeod said. "They asked a lot 
of questions, and I asked a lot of questions. It was a good session, but no 
offer has been made and no decision has been made. That's about all I can say 
right now. I'm just waiting." 
</P>
<P>
MacLeod, whom the Mavericks fired Nov. 29, is considered the leading candidate. 
He ranks eighth in career victories among NBA coaches and has close ties to 
Jerry Reynolds, the Kings' director of player personnel.

French yacht Charles Jourdan sailed into a whale today and sustained 
substantial damage, organizers of the Whitbread round-the-world ocean race 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The yacht, in seventh place at the time of the collision, is to continue the 
third leg of the race from Fremantle, Australia, to Auckland. 
</P>
<P>
Race officials in Auckland said skipper Max-Philippe Couteau had radioed to say 
the French yacht hit the whale early this afternoon. He said the planking on 
the starboard side had been damaged and there was a gash 6 feet long and 1 foot 
wide. 
</P>
<P>
"We are attempting to make temporary repairs at sea," Couteau told officials. 
"If possible and weather permitting, we will continue our route towards 
Auckland." 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand yachts Steinlager II and Fisher and Paykel continued to lead the 
23-yacht fleet late today.

University of Kentucky basketball fans too far away to pick up Wildcat radio 
broadcasts won't have to scramble any more to listen; they can let their 
fingers do the walking. 
</P>
<P>
With Host Communications, owner of broadcast-television rights, and originating 
station WVLK, the university is offering seven games via a 900 number. 
</P>
<P>
Listeners will have to pay 75 cents for the first minute and 45 cents for each 
minute thereafter to dial 900-903-3700 to get the Wildcats live by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be really interesting," said Ralph Hacker, executive general 
manager of WVLK. "The best idea would be to get a bunch of buddies together to 
help share the cost, then put it on a speaker phone." 
</P>
<P>
Approximate cost of listening to a two-hour game broadcast is $54.30. Also 
available will be several shows, featuring call-ins, Coach Rick Pitino, game 
stars and scoreboard reports, before and after the game, extending the 
presentation to as long as 5 1/2 hours. The cost of listening to it all would 
be about $148.80. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Dodson, network coordinator for Host, said Kentucky fans have gone to 
great lengths to get radio broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
"They've driven around and parked under a bridge, angled their car one way and 
their antenna another, rolled down the window and told the dog in the back seat 
not to move," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hacker said several fans have called during pregame talk shows to ask about the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
"Two calls were from Florida and one from Texas," he said. "A lot of fans go 
down to Florida to spend the winter." 
</P>
<P>
Fans need not subscribe in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Games on the 900 service will be Florida on Jan. 10, Alabama on Jan. 17, 
Tennessee on Jan. 20, at Florida on Feb. 12, at Alabama on Feb. 17, at 
Tennessee on Feb. 21 and at Notre Dame on March 5.
