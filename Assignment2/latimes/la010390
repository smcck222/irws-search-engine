CORNELIU BOGDAN; ROMANIA DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Corneliu Bogdan, 68, Romania's new deputy foreign minister. Bogdan served as 
Romanian ambassador to the United States from 1969 through 1977. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to Bucharest and was out of government for a time but later was 
named to a post in the foreign ministry that gave him authority over Western 
Hemisphere relations. However, there was friction with the government of 
Nicolae Ceausescu and he again left the ministry and was placed under what 
amounted to house arrest. He was allowed to travel to Washington in 1988 on a 
Woodrow Wilson fellowship and remained in the United States until a month ago 
when he joined the National Salvation Front leadership that has sought to run 
the country after Ceausescu was deposed. In Bucharest on Monday after a stroke.

LILLY DACHE, 97; FRENCH MILLINER, TREND-SETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lilly Dache, who came to the United States from France as a young woman and 
established herself at the forefront of the millinery world in an era where 
hats were a prime consideration of style, has died at a nursing home in 
Louvecienne, France. 
</P>
<P>
She was 97 and died Sunday. Although she had been retired for many years, her 
name continued to be synonymous with hats, particularly the turbans she created 
by draping fabric directly onto her clients' heads and then creating a personal 
design based on what she and the customer envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
Her annual showing of hats in this country came to be a highly anticipated 
event in the world of fashion. She visited the major department stores in the 
United States, charming fashion writers and store managers with her sparkle and 
chic accent. She often traveled with her husband, Jean Despres, an executive at 
Coty Inc., the cosmetics house. Most recently, she and Despres divided their 
time between homes in Delray Beach, Fla., and Meudon, France. Despres died last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Dache's clientele over the years included such Hollywood stars as Audrey 
Hepburn, Carole Lombard, Loretta Young, Sonja Henie and Marlene Dietrich. 
</P>
<P>
Like Coco Chanel, Miss Dache began as a milliner in her native France, then 
proceeded to fashion, cosmetics, furs, stockings, wigs, jewelry and even 
menswear. She became president of three cosmetics companies, Lilly Dache, Marie 
Earle and Lucien Lelong, all of which were later purchased by Pfizer 
Pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
Her first job in this country came when she was only 16 and saw a help-wanted 
sign in a hat shop on Broadway in New York City. She and another woman 
eventually bought the shop. Their business boomed in the 1930s when 
Depression-era women found that they could afford a new hat even if they could 
not buy a dress. 
</P>
<P>
Business prospered until the late 1950s when head wear gradually began to go 
out of style and she and her husband retired. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include a daughter and two grandchildren.

G. FEYNMAN; LANDSCAPE EXPERT, PHYSICIST'S WIDOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A funeral service is scheduled today at 2 p.m. at Mountain View Chapel in 
Altadena for Gweneth Margaret Howarth Feynman, a free-lance landscape designer, 
singer and widow of Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Feynman died Sunday of cancer at UCLA Medical Center, said Frances Lewine, 
a cousin. 
</P>
<P>
She was 55 and traveling in Egypt when her final illness began. Earlier she had 
been in the Antarctica, the last of the world's continents she had not visited. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Feynman began a free-lance landscaping business as an outgrowth of home 
gardening, Lewine said. 
</P>
<P>
A native of England, Mrs. Feynman came to the United States in 1959 and had 
lived in Altadena for the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
She was one of the founders of the Noyes Library at Alfred E. Noyes Elementary 
School in Altadena and of the Arroyo Singers, a non-professional women's choral 
group that was founded by the wives of several Caltech faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Feynman was the Nobel laureate's third wife. Her husband taught at Caltech 
and died in February, 1988. She is survived by a son, a daughter and a sister. 
</P>
<P>
In lieu of flowers, donations are asked to the John Wayne Cancer Clinic at UCLA 
Medical Center, P.O. Box 24209, Los Angeles 90024

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: ENTREPRENEUR WITH PARKING SOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Loses His Patience in San Francisco 
</P>
<P>
Bill Schwenker did not leave his heart in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old San Diegan thought he had a sure-fire idea for the chronic 
parking needs of San Francisco: a West German invention called a Park Lift that 
allows cars to be stacked, thus putting, for example, two full-size 
Mercedes-Benzes in a one-car garage. 
</P>
<P>
As a former broker for Shearson Lehman in La Jolla and former operator of 
fitness parlors in Oceanside, Solana Beach, Escondido and Pacific Beach, 
Schwenker also figured he knew something about being insistent and coping 
</P>
<P>
with bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it," Schwenker said. "I could never get a straight answer 
on what permits I'd need and how long it would take. I saw city employees 
drinking coffee, reading the newspaper, talking to their friends. One told me 
if I really wanted to open a business, I should try Oakland." 
</P>
<P>
The Oct. 17 earthquake, Schwenker concluded, has become an all-purpose excuse 
for civic inertia. 
</P>
<P>
In frustration, he wrote to Mayor Art Agnos. Nothing. He wrote to all 11 
members of the Board of Supervisors. Nothing times 11. 
</P>
<P>
He tried to call Agnos' $93,000-a-year deputy mayor for parking and 
transportation. The $93,000 deputy mayor was out, and his answering machine was 
on the fritz. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote a scalding letter ("rudeness is so pervasive that I can only assume it 
is city policy") to the San Francisco Examiner. The paper printed his letter on 
Christmas but misspelled his name. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, Schwenker will make another run at The City. He has decided that, 
although San Francisco is rightfully proud of its highbrow life style, it has 
disdain for most business ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he's got a stratagem for getting appointments with important officials, 
a way to tweak the interest of even the most lead-bottomed bureaucrat. 
</P>
<P>
He's going to tell them he wants to open a fancy restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
When Less Means More 
</P>
<P>
Here's what I hear. 
</P>
<P>
* Newly elected San Diego Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt has surprised her 
council colleagues with a mid-year request for two additional staff members. 
</P>
<P>
Her rationale is interesting: Under the new district elections system I'm 
responsible only for my own district. Thus I'm entitled to a larger staff than 
my predecessor Ed Struiksma, whose responsibility was citywide. 
</P>
<P>
More for less. If you don't understand the logic, you have a lot to learn about 
government. 
</P>
<P>
* The Union-Tribune has a long history of fighting against official secrecy. 
The newspapers' attorneys have gone to court a number of times to protect the 
public's right to know. 
</P>
<P>
There are limits, however. 
</P>
<P>
The U-T management asked the Newspaper Guild to agree to a news blackout on the 
mediation sessions set to begin today. The guild refused. 
</P>
<P>
* The cold and rain have meant an increased number of homeless people seeking 
shelter in the downtown library. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning, the men's room on the second floor was jammed with 
homeless men changing their clothes, shaving and taking sponge baths. Others 
were sleeping at reading tables. 
</P>
<P>
* The Naval Academy Glee Club is scheduled for a free public concert Thursday 
at the Balboa Park Organ Pavilion. The group has even gone modern, with a rock 
'n' roll troupe that promoters promise is "a Naval Academy version of Sha Na 
Na." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conservative Verse 
</P>
<P>
Ready for Libertarian poetry? Here's some light-hearted verse from the San 
Diego party's recent newsletter: 
</P>
<P>
If you have two apples 
</P>
<P>
 and I have but one 
</P>
<P>
 it's unfair, not right 
</P>
<P>
 undemocratic 
</P>
<P>
 I'll join a union 
</P>
<P>
 or a movement 
</P>
<P>
 start a riot 
</P>
<P>
 and kill you for your extra apple. 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, I prefer "I once knew a liberal from Nantucket . . . "

EVALUATORS GIVE SCHOOLS' DROPOUT PREVENTION EFFORT AN 'F' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The major effort by San Diego city schools to help students at risk of failing 
their grade -- as well as at risk of becoming dropouts -- has itself failed 
most of those students during its three-year history, school trustees were told 
Tuesday in a pair of highly critical evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
Without significant improvements in the district's ability to turn students 
around, the more than 18,000 now identified as at risk -- 15% of the almost 
120,000 students in the district -- will continue to fail, the studies said. In 
addition, a high percentage will continue to end up as dropouts, with blacks 
and Latinos showing up in disproportionate numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The reports, one each on efforts at the elementary and secondary level, 
criticized principals, teachers and central office administrators alike for 
drawing up plans that fail to address why students are not learning, that fail 
to do more than exhort students to do better at what they now do badly and that 
fail to suggest new ways of learning to motivate students or involve their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, students have underlying health or family problems -- often 
connected to poverty -- which affect their school performance but which 
teachers and counselors fail to take into account, either because of overwork 
or lack of training, the evaluation department reports say. The few students 
who improve do so on their own, according to the reports. 
</P>
<P>
The only bright signs found occur at a few schools experimenting on their own 
under the district's site autonomy program with innovative ways of reaching 
students who are doing poorly in school for a variety of reasons. Evaluators 
also found potential lessons for the district in the fact that they could find 
no 7th- or 10th-grade Asian students -- the two grades examined at the 
secondary level -- at risk anywhere in San Diego city schools during the first 
semester of 1988-89, the period chosen for the study. Previous studies for the 
district have talked of strong parental support and respect for learning among 
Asian groups. 
</P>
<P>
Using case studies of students, evaluators looked at the promotion and 
retention policy of the district, the nation's eighth-largest urban school 
system. That policy, passed in 1985, placed the district between those 
advocates urging that more students each year be retained by grade and those 
who believe grade failure stigmatizes a student for life. 
</P>
<P>
It calls for students in danger of being kept back a grade to be identified by 
teachers each fall and then be given an intervention plan to bring them up to 
grade level -- as measured by reading tests at the elementary level or by 
graduation credits at the secondary level. 
</P>
<P>
Although schools identify such students properly, the intervention plans have 
not worked, schools Supt. Tom Payzant conceded Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Four years ago, we tried to have the idea that you don't simply have a child 
repeat something that was not successful," Payzant said. "But what happened is 
that we were lulled by our own rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
But Payzant said that, even if the district improves academic intervention, it 
"alone may be simplistic, given the powerful needs of the students identified 
in the case studies." The studies told of students with difficult family 
situations, with inadequate food on the table, with lack of support from 
parents or friends. 
</P>
<P>
The most important factor, new board president Kay Davis said, is "we are not 
cutting it with the bottom-end kid. There may be a lot of reasons but, based on 
these reports, it's pointless for us to be holding kids back, if we're just 
doing the same (ineffective) stuff over." 
</P>
<P>
Davis argued that more needs to be done at the elementary level, "to be more 
aggressive" because otherwise the students will be promoted into junior and 
senior highs, where it is even more difficult to help a failing student. 
</P>
<P>
New board vice president Shirley Weber bemoaned a lack of caring comments from 
teachers and principals in the report. 
</P>
<P>
"There seemed to be no heart in the process, no enthusiasm for turning around 
students, to see the staff expressing some concern. . . . The kids (in the 
study) keep saying, 'No one really cares.' " 
</P>
<P>
Evaluation department director Betty Tomblin said later she was also 
disappointed with the lack of caring expressed in the report, "but there are 
many teachers who do care, but many may be tired." 
</P>
<P>
The board ordered Payzant to meet with community leaders involved with dropout 
prevention and recovery programs to come up with a list of recommendations. 
Trustees cited several efforts being tried at individual schools in pointing 
out that at least some educators are working successfully to help at-risk 
students succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Payzant agreed, saying he hopes the district's autonomy plans will bring forth 
a variety of ideas that can be widely tried. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we should rethink our entire approach" to at-risk students, Payzant 
said, pushing his belief that not all students learn at the same pace. He 
reiterated his interest Tuesday in programs in which, for example, elementary 
students might be placed in a multigrade situation to master the prescribed 
curriculum over three to four years. High school students might be given a year 
beyond the existing four-year system to complete required credits without 
stigma, he said.

NORTH COUNTY TRASH TRANSFER SITES URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A North County trash-collection plan to be unveiled next week calls for the 
installation of seven transfer stations where trash will be dumped and sorted 
for recycling before being hauled to distant landfills or trash-to-energy 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
Considerable opposition is likely from residents living near the proposed trash 
way stations. Strong protests also are likely to come from groups seeking to 
block the construction of a trash-to-energy plant in San Marcos and from those 
promoting more stringent recycling efforts than the county plan envisions. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Rollin, project manager for the North County transfer station project, said 
Tuesday that the plan, circulated to North County city officials last week, has 
drawn little reaction either way. Most city officials contacted Tuesday 
reserved comment on the lengthy report until they have time to study it. 
</P>
<P>
A meeting will be held at 4 p.m. Jan. 11 at Escondido City Hall for North 
County elected officials and technical staff members to comment on the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by San Francisco-based consultants Brown, Vence &amp; 
Associates, recommends trash way stations be situated in Oceanside, Vista, 
Carlsbad, San Marcos, Escondido, Fallbrook and the San Dieguito area. Seventeen 
suggested sites found to be "technically feasible, environmentally suitable and 
acceptable to the local community" are listed. 
</P>
<P>
Rollin stressed that the proposal is still in its draft stages. Final selection 
of the number and location of the way stations won't occur until public 
presentations are made in each North County city and community, starting Jan. 
15 in Fallbrook and ending Feb. 20 in Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
County supervisors will have the final say on the program and probably will 
tackle the decision in late March, Rollin said. After supervisors accept the 
report, an in-depth environmental study must be conducted on each of the 
selected sites, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
He said the study was ordered because landfills near urban areas are quickly 
running out of space. The existing North County landfill south of San Marcos 
will be full by mid-1991, he explained, long before transfer centers can be 
built to house the rubbish collected from coastal and inland cities until heavy 
semi-trailers haul the trash to new landfills situated far from the cities 
served. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside Councilwoman Melba Bishop, a crusader against any program that 
escalates trash fees for the public, said the trash way stations are "nothing 
but mini-dumps which would benefit the trash-hauler, not the public. They will 
have to fight me if they want to locate one of those dumps in Oceanside." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the way-station plan, she favors a single close-in landfill, in the 
central part of North County's population area, with rigid curbside recycling 
programs to cut down drastically on the trash that must be disposed of. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop also criticized the report for its lack of cost estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"How can we expect to make an intelligent decision when we have no idea what 
this system will cost?" she said. Bishop predicted that cost efficiencies in 
hauling trash to distant landfills "would benefit the haulers, not the public," 
and that the way-station project would cause trash-collection fees to 
skyrocket. 
</P>
<P>
The draft report released last week contained no cost figures but a report in 
June contained estimates on construction, equipment and land costs amounting to 
$108.4 million for a seven-station project. 
</P>
<P>
Rollin said the program would be paid by increases in tipping fees (charges 
trash collectors pay to empty their trucks), which in turn are paid by the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
Although the transfer centers will be located in non-residential areas and will 
be built so that most of the dumping and loading operations occur within an 
enclosed building, there is little that can be done about the parade of garbage 
trucks that must come to the centers to dump their local loads or the number of 
18-wheel trucks that will travel between the way stations and distant 
landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Truck traffic and the lack of an aggressive recycling program are expected to 
be two of the main reasons for opposing the transfer-station proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The 17 possible sites listed in the report are: 
</P>
<P>
Escondido: A strip west of Interstate 15, south of California 78 and north of 
Mission Road, and a smaller site south of Washington Avenue, west of Spruce 
Street. Both sites are next to the Santa Fe Railway spur tracks. 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos: Two sites in the hills south of Lake San Marcos along Questhaven 
Road and a third triangular site south of California 78 and bounded by Via Vera 
Cruz, Linda Vista Drive and Las Posas Road. 
</P>
<P>
Vista: Two sites along Sycamore Avenue south of the Shadow Ridge development. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad: Four sites along Palomar Airport Road, running from Camino del Norte 
on the west to the San Marcos city limits on the east, and a fifth site on El 
Camino Real, north of Palomar Airport Road and east of Palomar Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside: A site north of Mission Avenue and directly east of the Oceanside 
Municipal Airport runway, and a larger site, divided by Loma Alta Creek, north 
of Oceanside Boulevard and east of El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
Encinitas (San Dieguito area): A site at the southeast corner of the El Camino 
Real-Questhaven Road intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook: Two sites east of I-15 and north of Pala Road along Stewart Canyon 
Road.

NAVY SECRETARY TORPEDOES PLAN TO ADD BAY ENTRY; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH BAY: IN A LETTER TO CONGRESS NOT WIDELY DISSEMINATED, THE NAVY CONCLUDES 
THAT THE PROPOSED OUTLET THROUGH THE SILVER STRAND WOULD HARM MORE THAN HELP 
IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The effort to build a second entrance into San Diego Bay has hit another 
obstacle, the Navy telling Congress that the "marginal" benefits of a Silver 
Strand cut-through "are outweighed by potentially adverse effects" on Navy 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy's conclusions are contained in a letter from Navy Secretary H. 
Lawrence Garrett III to Rep. Bill Hefner (D-N.C.), who heads the House 
subcommittee on military construction. 
</P>
<P>
Although Garrett's letter is dated Oct. 27, it has not received wide 
dissemination, and only recently have opponents of the project become aware of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the San Diego Unified Port District, which is evaluating the 
feasibility of a second harbor entrance, said Monday that the agency was not 
aware of the Navy's findings. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of Rep. Bill Lowery (R-San Diego), the Navy was required to 
"identify and evaluate benefits of a second harbor entrance" as part of the 
1989 military construction appropriations bill. 
</P>
<P>
The results of the Navy's analysis, according to Garrett's letter, are that, 
although a Silver Strand entrance would be of some help, the cut-through would 
probably lead to more headaches. "No manpower or security benefits could be 
identified," Garrett said in summarizing the Navy's analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Among the benefits the Navy found are that a second harbor entrance "would 
increase operational efficiency for small craft during emergency dispersal from 
San Diego Bay," and that congestion at the Point Loma entrance to the bay would 
be reduced, decreasing the possibility of collisions. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a second entrance would reduce the time it takes small naval vessels to 
travel to training areas off Silver Strand, but the Navy placed savings as only 
"one hour per operation." And, based on an estimated 1,340 small craft 
operations a year in the Silver Strand area, the Navy said the shorter transit 
time would save about 35,622 gallons of fuel, a savings it put at about 
$23,000. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to the Navy secretary, "benefits to the Navy are outweighed by 
potentially adverse effects." The Navy's concerns are that an entrance in the 
South Bay would lead to more pleasure-boat traffic, "which may interfere with 
ship movements" in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Navy is worried about a second harbor entrance interfering with its 
shipment of "flammable and explosive materials" to North Island Naval Air 
Station and the Naval Amphibious Base, both in Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
The only highway access to the two bases is from either the Coronado Bridge or 
up the spine of the Silver Strand on California 75. But, because the transport 
of flammable and explosive materials is restricted on the bridge, the Navy 
relies on the state highway for these materials. 
</P>
<P>
"The Navy is concerned that the same kind of restrictions would be placed on 
the channel crossing for the new harbor entrance," according to Garrett. "We 
would then have to barge these materials, and the result would be decreased 
operational efficiency and significantly higher transportation costs." 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, the Navy says a second harbor entrance "may also present a serious 
encroachment problem to the Naval Radio Receiving Facility at Imperial Beach." 
Specifically, the Navy is concerned with the "electromagnetic/radio frequency 
interferences" that could be generated by the new bay entrance. 
</P>
<P>
"This facility is essential to our national defense posture," said Garrett in 
his letter. "Any development which has the potential for degradation of this 
facility's mission effectiveness would be unacceptable to the Navy." 
</P>
<P>
"After an examination of the issues associated with this proposal," the Navy 
secretary said, "we have concluded that a second harbor entrance would be of 
some marginal benefits to the Navy, and adverse effects outweigh those 
benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the the Navy's report was varied. 
</P>
<P>
Don Wood, president of C-3, a volunteer urban-planning and environmental group 
in San Diego, on Monday characterized the Navy's conclusions as "another nail 
in a coffin that's already closed." 
</P>
<P>
"This is another good reason why the Port Commission shouldn't be wasting 
money" on the proposal, Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
Many local environmentalists have criticized the lastest push for a second 
harbor entrance, saying a Silver Strand channel would lead to an environmental 
disaster in San Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
But proponents of the cut-through said they weren't surprised by the Navy's 
report. James E. Fink, chairman of the Second Harbor Entrance Project (SHEP), a 
private group that two years ago revived the issue and has been its leading 
advocate, said Monday that, contrary to the Navy secretary's letter, the Navy 
really wants the second entrance built. 
</P>
<P>
"They would love to see it but they don't want to pay for it," Fink said. "And 
I don't blame them. If they say it's a good thing for the Navy" they might be 
placed in a position of having to push for its construction. 
</P>
<P>
Fink, who said he's been aware of the letter from the Navy for several weeks, 
said he believes this to be true based on private conversations he has with 
Navy officers stationed at the amphibious base. "They want it as much as we 
do," Fink claimed. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of creating a second bay entrance has been discussed for more 
than 70 years and was the focus of a critical Army Corps of Engineers study in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
Early last year, the Port District tentatively approved allocating $600,000 to 
SHEP to begin initial environmental studies as well as to work with the nearly 
2 dozen government agencies with interests in or authority over the proposed 
cut-through. 
</P>
<P>
But last May, SHEP told the Port District to keep the money and instead asked 
the agency to take over the workload, which the Port District did. 
</P>
<P>
Port District Director Don Nay emphasized at the time that agencies such as the 
State Lands Commission and the Army Corps of Engineers "have absolute veto 
power" over the project. 
</P>
<P>
In taking over from SHEP, the Port District said it in no way was committed to 
the project beyond making initial inquiries into its feasibility.

Who has the world's toughest meter-maids? It could be Paramount (the city, not 
the studio). 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Paramount Lions Club received permission from the city to 
install a cautionary holiday display consisting of a wrecked automobile and a 
"Don't Drink and Drive" sign in a vacant lot. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks later, a reporter noticed that the battered heap had been slapped 
with a citation giving the owner 72 hours to remove it or face towing charges. 
In a classic understatement, the meter maid checked a box on the citation that 
said, "Apparently inoperative." 
</P>
<P>
Told of the ticket, city officials suspected it might be a joke. But a check 
revealed that it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently the officer came up from behind the car and didn't notice the 
sign," explained Deputy City Manager Pat West, adding that the warning won't be 
enforced. 
</P>
<P>
West pointed out that its enthusiastic traffic officers have helped Paramount 
develop a "strong vehicle abatement program. We've caused 1,000 inoperative or 
wrecked vehicles to be removed from the city in the last year." 
</P>
<P>
Make that 999. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. wasn't ignored in the end-of-the-year summaries of national publications: 
</P>
<P>
* A People magazine poll found that the Beverly Hills cop-slapper was the 
choice when its readers were asked: "Which of the following celebrities -- Zsa 
Zsa Gabor, Morton Downey Jr., Sean Penn, Joan Rivers or Donald Trump -- would 
you least like to be trapped in an elevator with?" Mort was second. 
</P>
<P>
* Esquire magazine's "Dubious Achievements of 1989" section listed this item in 
its "We-Are-but-Flowers/I'll-Have-My-Stamen-Call-Your-Stamen" category: "A club 
in L.A. featured poetry recitals by Judd Nelson, Robert Downey Jr. and Justine 
Bateman." 
</P>
<P>
* And, in its own dubious-taste poll, Newsweek magazine conferred the title of 
"Worst Amusement Park Ride" upon Universal Studios for "Earthquake," its 
simulation of a San Francisco disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Is this the '90s, or the free-love era of the '60s? 
</P>
<P>
A muffler-shop sign north of the Civic Center area says: 
</P>
<P>
FREE INSPECTION BRAKES SHOCK SEXHAUST 
</P>
<P>
There was quite a commotion at a small Mexican restaurant on Ventura Boulevard 
the other night when a customer discovered that he had misplaced his keys after 
locking his car. 
</P>
<P>
Helpful employees, as well as some customers, got down on their knees to search 
under the tables. Trash cans were emptied. Counter containers of two varieties 
of salsa were searched as a sanitary precaution. Flashlights were aimed inside 
the car. The hunt lasted nearly a half hour. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a valet from a nearby Greek restaurant appeared. He calmly walked to 
the rear of the car and pulled the keys out of the trunk lock. Always nice to 
have a professional around. 
</P>
<P>
But back to the '90s. Is this really going to be the decade for social 
consciousness? 
</P>
<P>
The Times received a call from one person complaining that, because of all 
those responsible revelers who avoided driving New Year's Eve, it was 
impossible to catch a taxi ride home from a Malibu restaurant.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POSTAL SERVICE TO BUILD GIGANTIC MAIL 
FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Postal Service has agreed to pay Newhall Land and Farming Co. $26.8 
million for 65 acres in the Santa Clarita Valley, where it plans to build a 
giant mail processing facility to serve northern Los Angeles County, company 
officials announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The new facility is scheduled for completion in 1993, said Ron Cook, a Postal 
Service spokesman. It is being built to relieve an overburdened postal facility 
in Van Nuys, which serves as the main distribution center for the San Fernando 
and Santa Clarita valleys and portions of eastern Ventura County, he said. 
</P>
<P>
With the explosive growth of northern Los Angeles County, the amount of mail in 
the region has increased 84% in the last 10 years, Cook said. The Van Nuys 
facility now handles 5 million letters and packages a day, and officials 
predict that amount will grow 85% by 2005.

A teen-ager pleaded guilty Tuesday to charges he used his home computer to make 
telephone bomb threats to a school and a restaurant and to tie up the phone 
lines of two law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old high school student from San Gabriel pleaded guilty in Pasadena 
Juvenile Court to two felony counts of making a false bomb report and one 
felony count of obtaining telephone services by fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Lowenstein said the youth used his home computer to 
make telephone bomb threats to Flintridge Academy and a fast-food restaurant in 
Temple City. He also used his computer's automatic re-dialing feature to tie up 
the telephone lines -- including the 911 emergency line -- of the Hayward 
Police Department and the Sheriff's Department's La Crescenta substation.

PASSENGER AIR SERVICE RETURNS TO PALMDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back in June, 1971, when the first commercial flight took off from the new 
airport in Palmdale, Joan Lewallen was there to snare the first ticket of the 
day. She saved it as a souvenir of what she thought was an auspicious beginning 
for an airport with a bright future. 
</P>
<P>
It was a future that never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
After 18 years of waiting, Lewallen was back at Palmdale Regional Airport again 
early Tuesday to once again snare the first ticket of the day, this time for a 
trip to Las Vegas. And once again, she had no intention of making the trip. But 
that wasn't what mattered. 
</P>
<P>
The little-known airport returned to life Tuesday with its first commercial 
passenger flight in five years. The flight not only marked the return of daily 
air service to the area but boosted residents' ardent hopes for the growth of 
the airport and their community. 
</P>
<P>
Souvenir hounds, aviation fans, a flock of real estate brokers and others 
boarded a 37-seat Boeing de Havilland Dash 8 turboprop Tuesday morning, making 
them the first passengers out of Palmdale on America West Airlines' new service 
to Las Vegas. The airline, the nation's 10th largest, plans four daily 
round-trips. 
</P>
<P>
"Today is an excellent day for this area. This is just marvelous," said 
Lewallen, who celebrated the start-up with about 50 others at the terminal. The 
60-year-old Palmdale resident stayed behind, though, preferring to save her $79 
one-way ticket as another souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
America West Flight 1017 took off at 11:05 a.m., 10 minutes behind schedule and 
carrying 30 passengers. After a relatively smooth flight of 47 minutes, the 
twin-engine airplane touched down in Las Vegas at 11:52 a.m., eight minutes 
ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Palmdale airport offered commercial service from 1971 to 1985, it 
never became well established and when the last carrier ceased operations 
there, the airport fell into disuse. It was a letdown for Los Angeles airport 
officials, who envisioned Palmdale as an alternative to the city's busy 
international airport. 
</P>
<P>
America West's decision to start service out of Palmdale had area residents and 
airport officials predicting Tuesday that the airport now is destined to expand 
with the surrounding Antelope Valley, one of the fastest-growing areas in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just the beginning of things to come," said Bob Van Dyke, a 
Quartz Hill resident who was on the first flight. "We see it as a coming-of-age 
for the area." 
</P>
<P>
The initial flight got rave reviews from passengers who praised the convenience 
of the terminal for its free parking and lack of congestion. 
</P>
<P>
"This is terrific. I've been waiting for service to come out of Palmdale for 
years," said passenger Dale Harrison, an engineer with Rockwell International 
Corp. He predicted that many people involved in the region's booming aerospace 
industry will opt for Palmdale over Los Angeles International and Burbank 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
Among the passengers Tuesday was Ron Rafferty, an aircraft mechanic and Mojave 
resident. Rafferty was accompanying his wife, Beverly, to Travis Air Force 
Base, where she was scheduled to have surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"To go to LAX is a real . . . " Rafferty said, trailing off. "It's hard to get 
in and out of there. They needed something like this up here." 
</P>
<P>
Woody Weber, America West's new station manager in Palmdale, said the airline 
is committed to staying in Palmdale, even though routine flights out may be 
only one-quarter full until the service becomes better-known. But he predicted 
that higher passenger volumes would come within three to six months.

CHILD CENTER CLOSES, OWNER LOSES LICENSE IN MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A day-care center in Santa Clarita where five children were sexually molested 
during a four-year period was permanently closed Tuesday and its owner 
prohibited from operating a day-care center, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement with the state Department of Social Services revokes the license 
of Mary Lee Koontz, owner of Koontz Day Care, but does not implicate her in the 
molestations that occurred in the center she operated at her home on Juneda 
Drive, said Mark Reese, a staff attorney with the department in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
But the agreement states that Koontz failed to protect children under her care 
and should have known that the boy, who was not identified, had molested girls 
and boys on at least 18 occasions at the center between 1983 and 1987. The boy 
is now a teen-ager, but officials have declined to say how old the boy was when 
the children were molested. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached in December but effective Tuesday, revokes Koontz's 
license but allows her to work for other licensed day-care facilities, Reese 
said. She obtained her license to operate a center Feb. 3, 1989, but had cared 
for children at her home since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
William R. Lively, an attorney representing Koontz, said the boy was not an 
employee of the center but declined to identify him further. The agreement 
acknowledged that the molestations took place but did not explain how the boy 
had access to the children or his relationship to Koontz Day Care. 
</P>
<P>
Koontz is the estranged wife of Santa Clarita City Councilman Dennis Koontz. He 
was not mentioned in the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department received complaints about the 
center and notified the state of the incidents in March. The department decided 
not to prosecute the boy, Lively said. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Social Services closed Koontz Day Care temporarily May 19 as 
a step toward revoking Koontz's license. The case was scheduled to go before an 
administrative law judge last month but the agreement precluded the need for a 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Lively said Koontz spared the victims the ordeal of the administrative hearing 
by agreeing to settle the case. He called it a magnanimous gesture to protect 
the children.

$150,000 FIRE IN SCHOOL OFFICES DESTROYS STUDENTS' RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fire swept through the offices of a Granada Hills junior high school Tuesday, 
causing an estimated $150,000 damage, the loss of student records and a delay 
in classes, authorities said. There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The fire left administrators at George K. Porter Junior High School scrambling 
to find new office space on the campus in the 15900 block of Kingsbury Street 
and replacement records for most of the school's 1,350 students. 
</P>
<P>
"Luckily, we think we have backup for most of the records, but it will take 
hundreds of hours to rebuild the students' files," said Principal Martin Pattee 
as he surveyed the damage to the school's administration wing. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported about 4:20 a.m., said Los Angeles Fire Department 
spokesman Pat Marek. The blaze appeared to have started in the school's 
counseling center, where student files are located, and spread to offices of 
two assistant principals, the health and attendance offices and a computer 
room, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Inspector Ed Reed said the cause of the fire was still under investigation. 
Pattee said arson investigators were at the scene throughout the morning and 
had said the cause was suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 20 firefighters extinguished the blaze, a water pipe broke in the 
ceiling of the administrative wing. The front office, which had not been fire 
damaged, was flooded until water to the school was turned off, said Rich 
Mendoza, plant manager at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Following a school district policy of not allowing classes in a school where 
there is no water, classes were delayed at Porter for about an hour until the 
pipe break was capped and water turned back on, Pattee said. 
</P>
<P>
He said $15,000 worth of computers were destroyed but backup computer disks 
containing many student records were housed in a fireproof box and appeared to 
have survived the fire. Still, complete records of students' academic careers 
will have to be pieced together. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have to scrape around and see what data exists," said Assistant 
Principal Betty White, director of counseling and guidance at the school. 
</P>
<P>
White said the Los Angeles school district will have students' grade records 
from prior schools but other individual information pertaining to counseling or 
focus of study may be completely lost. "We'll have to start from scratch," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Pattee estimated that it could take more than a year before the school is 
repaired and returns to normal.

At least three patrons were wounded and another 200 fled in terror early

"There was a tremendous amount of gunfire -- more than 50 rounds," said Sgt. 
Dan Irvin of the Culver City Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
"As the officers rolled up, the people came pouring out the door . . . with 
shots still being fired. 
</P>
<P>
"There were people running in all directions and cars driving in all 
directions," he said. "It looked like a mass migration." 
</P>
<P>
Irvin said no arrests had been made and no weapons had been recovered, and 
detectives had not determined what led to the gunfight. 
</P>
<P>
One woman suffered a chest wound and was in critical condition at Brotman 
Medical Center in Culver City, Irvin said. A man was treated at Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center for a minor hand wound and a woman was treated at 
Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood for a minor elbow wound. 
</P>
<P>
The identities of the victims were withheld pending notification of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin said more than 200 guests had responded to posted flyers and paid an 
entrance fee to attend the party at the Cover Girl Lounge at 9300 Jefferson 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing we know is that there was some sort of an altercation," the 
police sergeant said. "We know that there was more than one handgun and more 
than one gunman." 
</P>
<P>
Irvin said a man working across the street heard the shots and called police at 
2:40 a.m. A nearby patrol unit arrived moments later, police said, but the 
patrons fled so quickly that officers were able to interview only about 25 of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The gunmen apparently escaped with the fleeing patrons.

MCMARTIN JURORS RESUME DELIBERATIONS AFTER HOLIDAY BREAK; 
</P>
<P>
MOLESTATION CASE: THE JUDGE EXPRESSES RELIEF THAT THE PANEL IS SAFELY BACK. 
THEY STILL MUST DECIDE ON 40 COUNTS. 
</P>

Smiling and looking refreshed after a two-week vacation, all 12 jurors in the 
McMartin Pre-School molestation trial returned Tuesday to the downtown Criminal 
Courts Building and resumed deliberations in the longest criminal proceeding in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Beaming, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders said he was relieved 
that the eight-man, four-woman panel was safely back in the jury room. He had 
expressed fears earlier that the loss of a juror could result in a mistrial -- 
and a waste of the more than $15 million the case has cost county taxpayers -- 
but agreed to honor the jury's wishes that its partial verdicts not be unsealed 
and made final before the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Just before leaving on vacation, the jury -- which had turned in verdicts on 
only two of the 65 counts against Ray Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin 
Buckey, in six weeks of deliberations -- suddenly returned a flurry of 24 more 
verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
But optimism that it was winding up deliberations was premature, as the 
verdicts apparently concerned no more than three of the 11 alleged child 
victims. The jury still must decide 38 counts of molestation involving the 
remaining eight children, and a count of conspiracy against each defendant. 
</P>
<P>
No verdicts were turned in Tuesday, although the panel asked to see more 
exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
Pounders said Tuesday that he does not plan to unseal the verdicts piecemeal 
now, unless the jury appears to be bogging down or the loss of a juror seems 
imminent. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm willing to wait as long as they are making progress," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The verdicts are not official until they are affirmed by each individual juror 
in open court. 
</P>
<P>
The case, which first surfaced in 1983 with the arrest of Ray Buckey, now 31, 
based on a mother's allegation that her 2 1/2-year-old son had been sodomized 
at the seaside nursery school in Manhattan Beach, has been in trial for nearly 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation led to the arrests of the school's founder, elderly Virginia 
McMartin, and six teachers at her family-owned preschool. All seven were 
ordered to stand trial after an 18-month preliminary hearing, but Los Angeles 
County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner dropped charges against five, citing weak 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
As the investigation widened, scores of "uncharged suspects" were questioned, 
and nine South Bay nursery schools ultimately were closed.

NEW YEAR'S GUNFIRE REDUCED; 
</P>
<P>
SHOOTINGS: L.A.'S POLICE CHIEF CREDITS NEIGHBORHOOD WITNESSES AND FELONY 
PROSECUTION THREATS FOR THE DECREASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Surrounded by more than 100 guns confiscated over the holiday weekend, Los 
Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates on Tuesday credited threats of felony 
prosecution and a campaign urging citizens to report neighbors seen shooting 
skyward with a dramatic reduction in random gunfire on New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Gates said police arrested 66 people and seized 124 guns 
of all descriptions "capable of snuffing out someone's life whether you shoot 
directly at them or into the air." 
</P>
<P>
"Because of a lot of work of Neighborhood Watch programs and good citizens, and 
very fine police work," the chief said, "we have reduced what has been a very, 
very serious problem -- not to the extent we want to reduce it, but to a point 
where we feel we have had some success and an impact." 
</P>
<P>
While arrests were higher than ever, the number of reports of shots fired in 
the city was down 43% from last year, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually get about 1,300 calls," he said. "This year, we logged 706, which 
is an amazing difference." 
</P>
<P>
Felony charges are being filed against the 66 people, many of whose arrests 
were based on information supplied by their neighbors -- a fact that may 
present problems for county prosecutors needing witnesses to win a conviction, 
Gates acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
"These cases are difficult to prosecute without witnesses," the chief said. 
"But we are not going to pit neighbor against neighbor; that won't work. If we 
get into a situation where we are doing just that, we will probably drop the 
charges." 
</P>
<P>
Gates added, however, that "most citizens who complained, believe me . . . said 
they care, said they are tired of this and said they are willing to testify." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have a witness to get a conviction," said Sandi Gibbons, 
spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. "Fortunately, in the majority 
of the . . . felony cases we filed Tuesday, our witnesses are officers who saw 
the defendants fire the weapons into the air." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the fact that citizens often alerted police to the shootings in the 
first place bothered residents in some parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
For example, South Los Angeles resident Pat O'Neal, whose 19-year-old son was 
arrested Monday morning by police with search warrants, said she believes that 
the person who identified her son as a shooter may have had a grudge against 
her family, which owns and rents several houses on her street. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to tell police I don't know who called and set my son up like this," 
O'Neal said. "But I resent them coming over here and taking him out like he was 
a convict, and I resent my home being invaded by police." 
</P>
<P>
April Netterville, 21, who lives across the street from O'Neal, said police 
used search warrants to raid her home Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"They broke my bed," Netterville said. "They didn't find anything. They didn't 
arrest anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the problem of pitting neighbor against neighbor, Lt. Bruce Hagerty 
suggested additional problems in prosecuting the cases. 
</P>
<P>
"It will all depend on how good the investigation is and whether they 
(detectives) can show it was a negligent act," Hagerty said. 
</P>
<P>
"Shooting at something in a vacant field, for example, probably wouldn't be 
seen as a felony," the lieutenant said. "But shooting in the air in a 
neighborhood is a dangerous and negligent act." 
</P>
<P>
Conviction on a felony charge of discharging a weapon in a reckless manner 
carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Gates chastised a South Los Angeles gun dealer, Western Surplus, 
for staying open longer than usual on New Year's Eve in order to sell 
ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked them to suspend sales and they said, 'No way. This is the biggest 
time of the year for us to make money,' " Gates said. "I think the county 
district attorney ought to take a look at them." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Al Campbell, manager of Western Surplus, denied that 
police officials asked him to suspend ammunition sales and said his decision to 
stay open an extra four hours on New Year's Eve was a "matter of supply and 
demand." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell insisted that "we sell guns and ammunition in a legal manner." 
</P>
<P>
"We can't play judge and jury with our customers," he said. "Why do they let 
liquor stores sell liquor on New Year's Eve when they know people are going to 
drink and drive?" 
</P>
<P>
However, Campbell also admitted that some of his customers make no effort to 
hide the fact they intend to start the new year by shooting skyward at 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
"One customer said he was going to blow the hell out of 1989, because it was 
such a bad year for him," Campbell said.

8 HURT IN CRASH TRIGGERED BY SUSPECTED DRUNK DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A pickup truck driven by an alleged drunk driver fleeing the scene of an 
accident in Boyle Heights collided with another vehicle Tuesday, triggering a 
chain-reaction pileup that seriously injured three pedestrians, one of them a 
3-year-old girl, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In all, eight people were injured and four vehicles were involved in the 
chaotic event, which occurred near 1st and St. Louis streets and less than a 
block from the the city's Hollenbeck Police Station. 
</P>
<P>
Four men from the pickup, all of whom suffered moderate injuries, attempted to 
run away from the final crash, police said, but they were quickly apprehended 
by Hollenbeck officers who had heard the collision, rushed outside to 
investigate and saw them fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
The pickup's driver, Francisco Fonseca, 20, of Highland Park, was taken to 
County-USC Medical Center with chest injuries. 
</P>
<P>
He was booked on suspicion of felony drunk driving and felony hit and run 
driving, according to Lars Oakander, a Los Angeles Police Department traffic 
detective. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the chain-reaction accident occurred about 2 p.m., moments after 
the pickup collided with a car on St. Louis Street. 
</P>
<P>
According to Oakander, the driver of the pickup sped away from the first 
accident, in which there were no injuries. He headed south on St. Louis Street 
and sped through a stop sign at the intersection of 1st Street. 
</P>
<P>
In the intersection, the pickup slammed into a Ford Falcon, which struck a 
middle-aged male pedestrian and crashed into a telephone pole. The pickup, 
meanwhile, hit a Boyle Heights man and his 3-year-old daughter as they crossed 
1st Street in a crosswalk. The pickup also struck a 1979 Ford Mustang before 
coming to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the man and his daughter, whose identities also were not available, 
were both rushed to County-USC with serious injuries. The two were initially 
trapped under the pickup, and were pulled out by bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
The third pedestrian also was seriously injured and taken to County-USC, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The three other suspects in the pickup, and the driver of the Falcon, all 
suffered moderate injuries, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the Mustang, Angelina Rodriguez, 25, was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"I just saw the truck come head up with me," Rodriguez recalled later. "I heard 
people screaming, it was coming pretty fast." 
</P>
<P>
Five Los Angeles paramedic ambulances were called to take the victims to 
County-USC and White Memorial Medical Center. Police handcuffed the pickup 
truck driver and passengers before placing them in the ambulances. At least one 
of the suspects "got quite belligerent and threatening," Oakander said. 
</P>
<P>
A 13-year-old boy, who was in the Video Box shop at the corner of 1st and St. 
Louis streets described the impact as "a loud boom." 
</P>
<P>
"When I came out of the video store, people were lying all around the street," 
said the youth, who declined to give his name. "There were people trying to 
pull the truck off a man and a little girl. We have accidents around here all 
the time. Every Friday you see an accident around here. This is the worst by 
far." 
</P>
<P>
"There were pedestrians underneath the pickup," said Naomi Reyes, who works at 
a medical clinic on the block where the collision occured. "It was a terrible 
accident."

CEAUSESCU'S EXECUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A story by Times staff writer Robert C. Toth (Part A, Dec. 23) concerning 
deposed Romanian dictator Ceausescu poses a disturbing question about our 
government's behavior now and in the past 100 years. "Ceausescu's fall," 
comments the writer, "is laden with irony. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his brutally repressive domestic policies, he was long treated by 
Washington as the darling of East European leaders because during his 24 years, 
he refused to follow Moscow's foreign policy line." 
</P>
<P>
We have long been good at cozying up to brutal and repressive rulers 
(exchanging state visits, toasting the tyrants' devotion to "freedom," training 
and equipping their "defense forces," and otherwise propping them up) so long 
as they remain supportive of our own foreign policy objectives. Worse still, 
the dictators have often been our own creation, imposed by the American Marines 
or the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
Witness Marcos in the Philippines, Somoza in Nicaragua, Batista in Cuba, 
Pinochet in Chile, the Arena party with its death squads in El Salvador, to 
name but a few. Our record in Latin America has been particularly 
reprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
As one who loves the United States as his native country, I devoutly hope and 
pray for the day when devotion to human rights at home and abroad and respect 
for the dignity and sovereignty of all nations will replace narrow 
self-interest as the cornerstone of our country's foreign policy.

CEAUSESCU'S EXECUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The execution of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu illustrates the virtual 
impossibility of due process being dispensed by a revolutionary tribunal. Had 
the National Salvation Front conducted an open trial, one that required the 
prosecution to prove its allegations, while allowing Ceausescu the right of a 
legal defense, the verdict would have been the same, and so would his 
well-deserved sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of whether a kangaroo court or a constitutional court had passed 
sentence on Ceausescu, he still would have taken his rightful place in history 
along side the likes of Quisling, Laval, Stalin and Idi Amin. The problem with 
Ceausescu's summary execution is, that like the French Revolution 200 years 
ago, revolutionary justice provides the opportunity for a modern-day 
Robespierre to emerge from the existing vacuum and begin another reign of 
terror. 
</P>
<P>
To this end, it is critical that Romanian nationwide elections be held within 
the shortest possible time, and that the trials of Ceausescu's police state 
traitors be postponed until a duly elected government is in place.

UNCOMFORTABLE OCCUPATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two weeks after U.S. military forces invaded Panama, the first American troops 
were pulled out of the country as two batteries of Army artillery, 141 
soldiers, returned home to Fort Ord, near Monterey. The Bush Administration 
publicized the withdrawal to show that the process of getting our troops out of 
Panama is under way. But the sad truth is that U.S. soldiers are likely to be 
in Panama a long time, and the continued occupation runs the risk of 
counteracting the good that came from the brief war that toppled Gen. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
In point of fact, the military side of the Panama invasion was handled with 
relative ease. Resistance by Noriega's Panama Defense Forces and civilian 
militia ended within a few days, an indication of how shallow the thuggish 
dictator's popular support was. Unfortunately, the looting and chaos that 
followed the collapse of the PDF, which also controlled all of Panama's police, 
created a challenge that few military planners had anticipated. So we now see 
the incongruous image of American soldiers, in jungle gear and faces painted 
for camouflage, patroling the streets of Panama City like traffic cops. 
</P>
<P>
American soldiers are not trained to be cops. Or diplomats, for that matter, as 
should be obvious after several troubling incidents that occurred after 
military resistance ended and Noriega found refuge in the papal nunciature in 
Panama City. The initial American response to finding Noriega -- surrounding 
the building, shooting out the street lights around it, then blaring loud music 
at the facility at all hours to disorient the occupants -- was military. It 
took a couple of days for U.S. officials to realize that what they had on their 
hands was a sensitive diplomatic standoff that could better be handled by 
lowering the volume a bit. 
</P>
<P>
This past weekend's raid by American troops on the residence of Nicaragua's 
ambassador to Panama was another case of military priorities taking precedence 
when the rules of diplomacy should have prevailed. Whatever suspicions U.S. 
officials may have harbored towards Nicaraguan diplomats in Panama, these 
diplomats are entitled to the same protection and courtesy that U.S. diplomats 
demand, and receive, in trouble spots all over the world. The military raid on 
the Nicaraguan ambassador's residence was such an egregious violation of those 
rules that even President Bush was forced to publicly call it "a screw-up." But 
the raid was only the most publicized of several incidents in which American 
troops in Panama took actions that, while understandable in strictly military 
terms (such as stopping and searching diplomatic vehicles and detaining 
diplomatic personnel for brief periods of time) could undermine the long-term 
goals of U.S. policy, not just in Panama but elsewhere around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The primary goals in Panama are political and diplomatic -- getting the new 
government of President Guillermo Endara to work and getting the Endara 
government accepted as legitimate by other countries. The dilemma that the 
Administration faces is that an overwhelming U.S. presence is both helpful and 
a hindrance. 
</P>
<P>
Endara might not survive without the United States behind him. Panama is all 
but broke after years of Noriega's thievery and a U.S. economic boycott. The 
government money Endara has at his disposal comes from accounts controlled by 
U.S. officials. American troops keep law and order in most parts of Panama 
because the effort to build the remnants of the PDF into a new police agency, 
called the Popular Force, has been halting at best. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the longer the United States props Endara up, the more other nations, and 
especially Panama's wary Latin American neighbors, will regard him as an 
American puppet. And the longer U.S. forces stay in Panama, the more they 
dissipate the genuine relief, even gratitude, with which the troops were 
greeted by Panamanians in the immediate aftermath of the invasion.

OFFSHORE DRILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am sure that your article correctly reported the results of the hearing that 
banned offshore drilling in California waters, so I am appalled that such a 
momentous step was taken using scare tactics that to any reasonable person 
should have dictated exactly the opposite result ("Off-Limits Signs Go Up 
Offshore," Part A, Dec. 7). 
</P>
<P>
That a couple of politicians such as Gray Davis and Leo McCarthy could use the 
Exxon Valdez as an excuse to ban oil drilling offshore means that they are 
deliberately distorting or ignoring facts that every schoolchild should 
recognize. 
</P>
<P>
The Exxon Valdez oil spill, which was used as the primary argument for the 
drilling ban, was a tanker spill, not an oil drilling accident. The sheer size 
of this catastrophe was made possible by the concentration of oil production of 
many wells into one vessel in the hands of a negligent and very cavalier oil 
company. It should be punished accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
The truth of the matter is that we have only three places to get the oil we use 
so profligately in California: domestic production (declining and under great 
pressure from "environmentalists"); offshore oil drilling in our own waters 
(with a good environmental record), and guess what -- giant tankers from Alaska 
and foreign producers, each carrying millions of gallons of oil. 
</P>
<P>
Recently I drove the Oregon and Northern California coast and admired its 
pristine beauty. I'd like to protect it from tanker spills, too. I vote for 
offshore drilling with strict accountability for safety by the oil companies.

MISSING BAGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Travelers who find their luggage missing would do well to file a police report, 
not just a complaint with the airline -- their luggage may well have been 
stolen, not lost. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department detective who recovered my two bags (empty) 
from the home of an arrested receiver of stolen goods advised me that such 
theft is a common occurrence at all airlines at all airports. 
</P>
<P>
This receiver had 150 bags at his home when arrested. The detective told me a 
thief can waltz out with perhaps four bags a day, selling them each (unopened) 
to a receiver for $75 apiece. (One such bag contained $10,000 worth of cocaine, 
one thief told the detective.) 
</P>
<P>
Such people are ripping off us, the airlines and their insurance companies. 
Perhaps if enough "lost" luggage were repored to the police, security would be 
tightened at the baggage claim areas. Since we have electronic readers to route 
the bags, can't electronic readers be used to assure that only the proper 
owners can retrieve the bags? 
</P>
<P>
I'm glad my real valuables were in my carry-on luggage.

BUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About once every 18 months The Times publishes a letter complaining that buses 
add to pollution and traffic congestion (letter, Dec. 17). True, their engine 
emissions need improvement. 
</P>
<P>
But I wondered today, as I stood in the aisle with 40 other passengers, what it 
would be like if we all occupied the same space on the street in 40 
automobiles, based on the prevailing statistic of approximately one person per 
car. 
</P>
<P>
Other impediments to drivers are pedestrians and those pesky bicycles. I can 
only imagine the annoyance of one motorist when I asked him to back up his 
100-plus-horsepower getaway special, which had me and a woman with a baby 
carriage trapped in the crosswalk.

THE DUBIOUS VALUE OF NO. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz made a strong case Tuesday for ranking his Irish as 
the No. 1 college football team in the nation. Alas, the nation's sportswriters 
and coaches already were voting to put Miami in the top spot since the Florida 
school was the only one to defeat Notre Dame in 1989. Beyond that, Holtz should 
not have felt compelled to lobby so vigorously for the mythical national 
championship since it is -- remember -- only mythical. The Notre Dame record 
speaks for itself, both academically and on the athletic field. 
</P>
<P>
The debate this year over who's No. 1 went to extremes. This frenzy has once 
again prompted proposals for a playoff system that would determine a true 
national champion, one that could not be questioned or debated. But several 
rounds of playoffs would only exacerbate the real problem with intercollegiate 
athletics today: Too many games, too much national television exposure for the 
top teams, too much money at stake and too much pressure to win, win, win. 
</P>
<P>
The nation already has one professional football league with a monthlong 
playoff period, including the obscene two-week hype before the annual Super 
Bowl. The guys in the NFL are there for money, not education. It is supposed to 
be different for students. But college sports seasons are already so long that 
fewer than 30% of football and basketball players graduate, according to this 
week's U.S. News &amp; World Report. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, there is no guarantee that a college football playoff system would end 
the controversy over who's No. 1. What if the flu hit an undefeated No. 1 team 
just before the semifinal or championship game? And even the best team goes 
flat once in awhile, as in Notre Dame's 27-10 loss to Miami in the last game of 
the 1989 regular season -- or Miami's defeat by Florida State for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
The solution is not to lengthen the season and play more games before national 
television audiences. What is needed is for the academic world to recapture 
control of intercollegiate athletics. College and university presidents should 
finally summon the intellectual fortitude needed to reverse the stampede toward 
professionalization and commercialization of college athletics.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego police officer was legally justified in shooting a 70-year-old man 
last fall when the man fired a handgun at the officer in an attempt to keep his 
son from being arrested, the San Diego County district attorney's office has 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Andrew T. Hoffman had "no choice but to defend himself with deadly 
force" when he fired 15 rounds at Lawrence W. Jarman, striking him in the groin 
and leg during an altercation near 29th Street and Imperial Avenue, the 
district attorney concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Jarman, who recovered from his wounds, later pleaded guilty to brandishing a 
firearm. The officer was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
According to the district attorney's report -- dated Oct. 19 but released by 
police Tuesday -- Hoffman and a civilian ride-along responded to a fight 
outside Jarman's home Oct. 1. While attempting to arrest Jarman's son, the 
officer was confronted by the elderly Jarman, who, according to the report, 
appeared behind the screen door and demanded that Hoffman let go of his son. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after the shooting, Hoffman said he "turned around, looked at 
the screen door and saw Jarman behind the door holding the gun with his arm 
extended." 
</P>
<P>
Believing the elder Jarman should have easily recognized him as a police 
officer, Hoffman said, he began firing when the man did not lower his handgun. 
</P>
<P>
Jarman, in a separate interview with authorities, said he genuinely worried for 
the safety of his son, Lawrence W. Jarman Jr., during the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him (the officer) to get . . . off of my son or I'd shoot him . . . and 
I meant it. I didn't know at the time he was a police officer."

An elderly man was found dead Tuesday morning in the bedroom of his East San 
Diego home, his hands tied behind his back, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The dead man was identified as Romie Hall, 84, a retired security guard. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of death and motive for the apparent homicide are unknown. An autopsy 
will be performed today, a spokeswoman for the San Diego County coroner said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said neighbors became concerned when they discovered Hall's front door 
ajar and his car missing Monday evening, although no one called 911 until 
Tuesday morning. When officers arrived at 9:43 a.m., they found Hall lying face 
down in a bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
The burned-out shell of Hall's car was found Tuesday night by San Diego police.

More than 400 pounds of oranges were removed from the shelves of a supermarket 
in Point Loma Tuesday after the FBI notified police that the fruit may have 
been injected with poison. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Police Department received a call shortly after 5 p.m., saying 
the oranges may have been injected with nicotine sulfate, which, taken in 
large-enough doses, can be lethal. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Jake Hughes said employees of the Vons market in the 1600 block of 
Rosecrans Street were contacted by an anonymous caller, who claimed to have 
made the injections. Hughes said supervisors at the store called the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at the supermarket declined comment Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Nicotine sulfate is nicotine, nothing more," said Greg Przekwas, spokesman 
with the San Diego Regional Poison Center. "It is poisonous in high enough 
concentrations." 
</P>
<P>
The oranges are being held by the San Diego Police Department pending further 
investigation.

A 38-year-old man became the city's first homicide victim of 1990 when an 
apparent argument over drugs in Southeast San Diego ended with a shotgun blast, 
police reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Jose Ayala of San Diego was arguing with two men when one of them shot 
him in the face with a shotgun, police said. 
</P>
<P>
There have been no arrests in the slaying, but police said their investigation 
has uncovered leads. Monday's 8:30 p.m. shooting occurred in the 3600 block of 
Ocean View Boulevard. No weapon was found. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala was shot "at very close range, and was dead at the scene," police said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that Ayala and two men were arguing over the right to 
deal drugs at the location. One of the men left, then returned with a shotgun, 
aimed it at Ayala's face and fired once. 
</P>
<P>
The site where the slaying occurred is "a pretty high narcotics use and sales 
area," said Sgt. Jim Duncan.

STRUGGLING USIU FEELS A BIT BETTER AFTER PUTTING AWAY CORNELL

<P>
Gary Zarecky, the U.S. International University basketball coach, picked up an 
eraser and attempted to wipe a chalk board clean in the middle of the clamor of 
the winning locker room Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Zarecky didn't get far. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, don't do that," a high-pitched voice screeched from a pack of celebrating 
Gulls. 
</P>
<P>
Written on the board was: "Victory is oh so sweet when it's an Ivy League team 
you beat." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to blame the USIU players if they wanted to gaze at the words a 
little longer. For a team that has recently been struggling with mediocrity, 
their 95-86 victory over visiting Cornell was much needed. 
</P>
<P>
USIU did everything it needed to do against Cornell, putting together a scoring 
spurt when it trailed early and hitting nine of 10 free throws in the closing 
minutes to clinch the game. That was in sharp contrast to recent weeks, when 
USIU (5-10) seemed to do everything in needed to lose. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys have invented the newest ride at a state fair with all the ups and 
downs we've had this season," Zarecky said. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, it has mostly been down. In the past two weeks, the Gulls lost to 
previously winless Colgate and a Winthrop team it easily could have beaten to 
drop to 2-3 on their nine-game home stand and virtually guarantee their ninth 
consecutive losing season. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been in pain," Zarecky said. "The team has been trying to get away from 
that pain. 
</P>
<P>
"My athletic director came to me and said 'Maybe we should take our 
concentration away from that pain.' We've been wallowing in self-pity and 
heartbreak." 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls were feeling no pain when the season started with five returning 
starters, guard Kevin Bradshaw and 17 games at home. 
</P>
<P>
That quickly changed when USIU was routed by Oklahoma and Arkansas and then 
began losing games at home to teams it should have beaten. 
</P>
<P>
"Our schedule stripped us early on and took with it some of our confidence," 
Zarecky said. "We're still trying to get that confidence back." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the Gulls beat a team it should have by showing an intensity that had 
all but disappeared the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Cornell took a 9-6 lead behind three consecutive baskets and a free throw by 
center Bernard Jackson. But 6-foot-11 center Mike Sterner came in off the bench 
and shut Jackson down as the Gulls went on a 13-0 run and took a 17-9 lead. 
USIU never trailed again. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw scored seven points and freshman Issac Brown added six in USIU's 
scoring run. The Gulls led, 36-27, at halftime and began to spread the lead 
early in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls had their biggest lead, 73-57, with 8:31 remaining. Cornell (3-7) 
chipped away to trail by just 84-79 with 1:37 left, but four USIU players 
combined to make seven of seven free throws in the final 1:32 to clinch the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw scored 28 points, and Demetrius Laffitte added 25 for USIU. Jackson 
had 32 points for Cornell. Steve Smith, having his finest year at point guard, 
had 11 points for USIU and also had 11 assists to give him 110 for the season. 
Smith should easily break the single-season record of 127 he set last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls play host to Central Connecticut State, which lost to SDSU Saturday, 
tonight at 7:30 at Golden Hall. USIU will close out its home stand against 
Sacramento State Tuesday and Point Loma Nazarene next Thursday.

ANTELOPES REBOUND, HOLD OFF HART, 59-56 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Although its offense often sputtered, Antelope Valley High regained some of the 
respect it recently lost by holding off a late Hart surge for a 59-56 nonleague 
victory Tuesday night . 
</P>
<P>
Just five days ago, the Antelopes (11-3) were humiliated in a 46-point loss to 
Cleveland. But they bounced back well at Hart. 
</P>
<P>
"That Cleveland game took us out real bad," said guard Jabbar Briggs, who 
finished with 12 points Tuesday. "We had to rebound. That's what we're capable 
of and that's what we did." 
</P>
<P>
With a minute to play and Hart trailing, 57-53, the Indians worked for a shot 
but were unable to find one for 30 seconds. Finally, three players set a screen 
at the top of the key, allowing Micah Ohlman to unload a 23-foot, three-point 
bomb that cut the deficit to a point. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley turned the ball over and the Indians had a chance to take their 
first lead since the first quarter. After a timeout, however, Ohlman fouled B. 
J. Petersen. Ohlman made amends by grabbing the rebound when Petersen missed 
the front end of a one-and-one. 
</P>
<P>
Hart (11-4) called a timeout with 10 seconds to play but turned the ball over 
after Briggs batted it from Renato Rivas' hands. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Paiz, who was fouled with five seconds left, made both free throws to ice 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Brock Chase scored six of his 10 points in the final quarter to pace the 
Antelopes. Rivas scored eight points in the final quarter, but the Indians were 
otherwise limited to Ohlman's three-point basket and a field goal by Marty 
Downen. 
</P>
<P>
Hart Coach Greg Herrick, whose squad also lost to Cleveland, was not impressed 
by either team Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything you could possibly do poorly, we did," Herrick said. "Two 
high-powered, up-tempo teams and it's 59-56? I can't believe Antelope Valley 
can apply more pressure than Cleveland. We just fell apart." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Walters led all scorers with 17 points for the Antelopes. Downen and 
Rivas paced Hart with 12 points each.

SANTA MONICA BEGINS SEASON THAT COUNTS AS TEAM TO BEAT

<P>
The preconference season is over, so the optimism that junior college 
basketball coaches and players shared before the season began has been reborn. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale, Moorpark, Valley and College of the Canyons will begin their Western 
State Conference schedules this week, and each team knows that no matter how it 
has performed up to this point, its season depends on the next 14 or 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
"Preseason records don't mean too much," Santa Monica Coach John McMullen 
observed, "because everyone starts off undefeated in conference." 
</P>
<P>
True enough, but any team with designs on the WSC championship must knock off 
Santa Monica, which finished undefeated in conference play last season and is 
on another roll entering its opener tonight against Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
The Corsairs are 16-3 and coming off a victory Friday over previously unbeaten 
Rancho Santiago, which was ranked No. 1 in the state by the JC Athletic Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica is led by forwards Cornelius Banks and Mark Moten. Banks, a 
freshman, is averaging 15 points and eight rebounds a game. Moten, a sophomore, 
averages 15 points and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica is favored to repeat as champion of the WSC Southern Division, 
which also includes Glendale, Valley, Canyons, Bakersfield and West Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark and Ventura are co-favorites in the Northern Division, which also 
includes Oxnard, Santa Barbara and Cuesta. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (12-6) will play West L. A. today at 2 p.m. at Veterans Auditorium in 
Culver City. Glendale had won seven games in a row before losing to Mt. San 
Jacinto in the Palomar tournament last week. Sophomore guard Bruce Heicke is 
Glendale's leading scorer, averaging 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
Valley (9-8) will play tonight at Canyons (7-10). 
</P>
<P>
Five Valley players are averaging in double figures, including forwards Steve 
Ward (17.8) and Shawn DeLaittre (13.8). 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark (12-5) will open conference play Saturday night at Cuesta. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman point guard Sam Crawford is the Raiders' catalyst, averaging 18.8 
points and 11.9 assists.

HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: MCRAE'S MISS PROVED TO BE BIG HIT 
</P>

<P>
Cleveland High Coach Marc Paez says with a very straight face that the play 
"set the tone for the game." 
</P>
<P>
Tone? If this were music, the tone would be an off-the-scale Z-flat, a definite 
"clang." If it were color, the tone would be something between metallic gray 
and smog-bound brown. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of the ebb and flow of basketball, however, Paez says that the word 
means establishing presence with authority. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the coach insists that Bobby McRae definitely wrote a tome on 
tone. 
</P>
<P>
The scene: A showdown with highly regarded Antelope Valley in a semifinal game 
of the Hart tournament. Antelope Valley had been installed as the 
pre-tournament favorite by many. 
</P>
<P>
The set-up: Cleveland center Trenton Cornelius swats the opening tip to McRae, 
who gathers the ball and makes a power move to the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
McRae, who last week was selected the most valuable player of the Hart 
tournament, attempts to dunk the ball a scant two or three seconds into the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The result: The ball hits the iron harder than a steroid-chomping weightlifter 
and ricochets into the lights. 
</P>
<P>
McRae might have learned a lesson about the gravity of gravity, but he showed 
Antelope Valley that Cleveland meant business. The Cavaliers dashed past 
Antelope Valley, 26-9, in the first quarter en route to a 92-46 win. 
</P>
<P>
How lopsided was it? Antelope Valley Coach Skip Adams said that his team had 
been "embarrassed" by the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
"He missed the dunk," Paez said of McRae, "but he established that we were 
going to play our game." 
</P>
<P>
McRae didn't miss much of anything else in the tournament, leading Cleveland to 
the title by scoring a team-high 15 points in a 71-61 victory over stubborn 
Hart in the final. 
</P>
<P>
However, McRae said that after averaging a steady-but-unspectacular 14 points 
over four tournament games, he found his selection as MVP a little surprising. 
He expected the honor to go to one of Cleveland's many flashy, ubiquitous 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I did it as much with my defense and rebounding," said McRae, who 
averaged 11 rebounds in the tournament. "My scoring was pretty average, but I 
rebounded good." 
</P>
<P>
Good, for McRae, is when he's bad. Or more accurately, when he's mad. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, former Coach Bob Braswell likened McRae's on-the-floor countenance 
to that of former NBA enforcer Maurice Lucas, whose legendary scowl could melt 
an opponent's shoelaces. 
</P>
<P>
"That's because I always look mad," McRae said with a grin. "He said that my 
game face reminded him of (Lucas), that I never smiled." 
</P>
<P>
Things have been a little more cheerful this season for McRae, a two-year 
starter and three-year letterman. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore, McRae spent most of the season on the bench in what he termed a 
"watch-and-learn season." 
</P>
<P>
The primary object of his court-side vision, as often as not, was Cal-bound 
power forward Rich Branham. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, McRae learned just as much starting alongside front-liners Lucious 
Harris (Cal State Long Beach) and Warren Harrell (New Mexico State). Hardly bad 
role models. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, he improved by osmosis, if nothing else. In his first two 
years on the team, McRae's main contribution offensively was an occasional 
15-foot jump shot from near the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior, he has scored most of his points inside, ripping down offensive 
rebounds and knocking in the put-back. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hitting the boards harder, trailing on the break, helping out however I 
can," said McRae, 6-foot-5, 185 pounds. "I want to be more in the offense this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Paez found that McRae's presence is worth more than a few points. McRae was 
absent for much of the summer-league schedule after suffering a broken right 
wrist -- just as Paez was taking over for Braswell. 
</P>
<P>
"When he came back," Paez said, "there was an immediate upswing in the 
confidence of the other players." 
</P>
<P>
McRae's emergence has sparked an about-face in the team's overall performance 
too. Cleveland struggled to a 1-3 start but has bounced back to win nine of 10. 
</P>
<P>
"He does so many things that aren't in the score book," Paez said. "His 
defense, rebounding, his intensity and leadership . . . He leads both by 
example and by exhorting his teammates." 
</P>
<P>
And the coach isn't talking about the proverbial, rah-rah stuff. Sometimes, 
exhortation can take the form of a missed dunk. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, he said everything we wanted to say on that one 
play," Paez said. "Who cares if he missed?"

UTAH STATE NEXT STOP FOR HAMPTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three Glendale College football players have committed to four-year schools and 
will transfer in a few weeks at the semester break, Glendale Coach John Cicuto 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Sean Hampton, a graduate of Sylmar High, will attend Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
Hampton rushed for 760 yards and seven touchdowns last season for Glendale and 
also caught 11 passes for 147 yards and two touchdowns. In 1988, Hampton gained 
1,150 yards and scored 13 touchdowns and was an All-Western State Conference 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Pat Lynch, who played at Burroughs High, will attend San Jose 
State. Lynch had 39 receptions for 581 yards and five touchdowns this season. 
</P>
<P>
Mark MacMillan, an all-state defensive back for the Vaqueros in 1988, chose 
Alabama over USC. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans might have lost MacMillan, but they gained an offensive lineman 
when Reseda High's Jason Keiderling orally committed to USC. Keiderling (6-5, 
255), an All-City 3-A Division selection, had scheduled trips to Cal, Oregon, 
Stanford and UCLA but canceled them after committing to USC. 
</P>
<P>
Keiderling said that he liked USC's winning tradition and its strong academic 
program in business. He carries a 3.4 grade-point average and said that he has 
scored 1,130 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK / STEVE ELLING: SAN FERNANDO DECKED BY TAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Their eyes seemed red and bleary, their legs a little wobbly. Their shooting 
touch was unsteady, but San Fernando Coach Dick Crowell chalked it up to a road 
trip and a long layoff. 
</P>
<P>
After winning a first-round game in the Las Vegas Eldorado tournament, the 
catatonic Tigers lost to host Eldorado in the second round. San Fernando fell 
in its third and final game too, but Crowell figured that its 12-day layoff 
before the tournament and the four-hour bus ride to the event finally had taken 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
Until he checked out of the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
As Crowell signed the final tab, he noticed that a group of players had charged 
a series of videotape rentals to the bill on the first night of their stay. 
</P>
<P>
"The hotel offered tape rentals," Crowell said. "Nothing X-rated or anything, 
just regular movies." 
</P>
<P>
In terms of the movies' effect, though, it was strictly horror fare. Night of 
the Living Dead comes close to describing how San Fernando played in its last 
two games. 
</P>
<P>
Crowell said that after winning their first-round game, players were given a 2 
a.m. curfew because the second-round game wasn't scheduled until 7:30 the 
following evening. 
</P>
<P>
Sounds reasonable, you say? Well, the VCR wasn't even getting warmed up at 2. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill said they had signed out tapes at 3, 5 and 7 in the morning," Crowell 
said. "It turns out that we went out for brunch, and they slept the rest of the 
day when we got back." 
</P>
<P>
They napped during the game too. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them that when you snooze, you lose," Crowell said. 
</P>
<P>
Old habits die hard: Jermoine Brantley says that it was all a misunderstanding. 
And, apparently, it still is. 
</P>
<P>
For the first two years of his varsity basketball career at Granada Hills, 
Brantley answered to the first name of Jamal. He now admits that that's where 
the problem all started, and that it was his fault. 
</P>
<P>
"A bunch of the kids in the neighborhood always called me Jamal because they 
couldn't remember Jermoine," said Brantley, who lives in Los Angeles. "Jermoine 
has always been my name, but nobody was getting it right when I started at 
Granada Hills, either, so I told them they could call me Jamal. But I told 
Coach that when he wrote it down for the record that I wanted to be called 
Jermoine." 
</P>
<P>
Well, something is still amiss. When his coach, Bob Johnson, recently called 
Brantley to the telephone, Brantley answered to Jamal. 
</P>
<P>
Does Brantley still react when called Jamal? 
</P>
<P>
"He does to me," Johnson said.

DIGEST: MAYOR TO HONOR AMERICAN LEGION WORLD CHAMPIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley will present the members of the Woodland Hills West American 
Legion team with a commendation today, honoring the team for winning the world 
series last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley will present the proclamation to the team at El Camino Real High at 
2:45 p.m. The West team was composed of players from El Camino Real and Canoga 
Park highs. 
</P>
<P>
Woodland Hills West, the only team from the Valley's District 20 to win the 
national championship, defeated Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, 11-5, in the 
championship game in Millington, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The proclamation, which lists every player and coach on the team, singles out 
El Camino Real graduates Del Marine and Carl McFadden, who won individual 
trophies for their performances in the national tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Humphrey, a starting guard on the Cal State Northridge basketball team, 
is expected to miss tonight's game against Biola because of a bruised right 
thigh and a sore back. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey, averaging 9.4 points and 3.5 assists a game, did not play in the 
second half of Saturday's loss at Sacramento State after sustaining the thigh 
injury in the first half. He injured his back two days earlier when he was the 
victim in a hit-and-run auto accident. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Bill Mazurie will start in place of Humphrey, who is also questionable 
for Friday's game at Southern Utah State.

PEOPLE: DREXEL GIVES SHER ADDITIONAL POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. on Tuesday named Allan Sher, 58, the senior 
management official assigned last year to supervise the firm's Beverly Hills 
operations, to the additional post of vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
With the addition of Sher, the firm will have three vice chairmen, including 
Fred Joseph, the firm's chief executive, and Herbert Bachelor, who oversees 
corporate finance activities. 
</P>
<P>
Sher, who has been with Drexel since 1983, was already on Drexel's board and 
continues as a member of the firm's executive committee. Sher's appointment 
last year to oversee Drexel's Beverly Hills-based corporate finance, high-yield 
and capital markets departments was a result of the firm's settlement of 
securities fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the Beverly Hills operations had been inadequately supervised 
from Drexel's New York headquarters while Michael Milken was head of the high 
yield junk bond department, the SEC had insisted that Drexel name a senior 
management official who would live in the Los Angeles area to oversee the West 
Coast operations. Before Sher was given that job, he had served as head of 
Drexel's retail division. The firm eliminated that division last year. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Anreder, Drexel's spokesman, said Sher's promotion had nothing to do 
with the SEC settlement. He said it was based simply on a decision by the 
firm's board to give Sher additional recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Securities industry analysts noted that during Joseph's term as chief executive 
a variety of executives in addition to Joseph have been vice chairmen, and they 
said the Sher's promotion doesn't appear to change Joseph's status within the 
firm. Perrin Long, an analyst at Lipper Analytical Services, said Sher's 
promotion appeared to be part of a current Drexel policy "to reward people by 
giving them bigger titles." 
</P>
<P>
Drexel also named three new senior vice presidents, including John H. Kissick, 
48, who last year was named to succeed Milken as head of Drexel's high-yield 
department. The other two new senior vice presidents are Burton M. Siegel, 54, 
in charge of the firm's international activities, and Richard J. Wright, 38, 
the firm's chief financial officer. SCOT J. PALTROW

BOND PRICES DIP IN REACTION TO ECONOMIC DATA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wires Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bond prices finished mostly lower Tuesday, weakened by a new report on U.S. 
manufacturing showing that the pace of economic decline has slowed. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell 3/16 point, or $1.87 for every 
$1,000 in face value. Its yield, which rises when the price declines, increased 
to 7.99% from 7.97% on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The market was closed Monday for the New Year's Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said bond prices were tipped lower by a new report by the nation's 
purchasing managers showing that the industrial economy slowed in December for 
the eighth straight month but at the lowest rate of decline in six months. The 
National Assn. of Purchasing Management, which charts economic trends by 
polling its members, said its index registered 48% in December, up from 46.6% 
in November but down from 57.3% in December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"It indicates that the decline in the manufacturing economy has probably 
bottomed out," said Elizabeth Reiners, a vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Bond traders believe that the Federal Reserve is more likely to relax credit 
and allow interest rates to fall if the economy is slowing. The report of a 
pickup in the economy led them to believe that the Fed would not push rates 
downward. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight 
loans, was quoted late in the day at 8.50%, up from 7.50% on Friday. Analysts 
said the steep jump was due mainly to technical market factors. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Makes Gains as Gold Declines 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended the trading day with a strong advance against most major 
currencies despite reported efforts by the Federal Reserve to drive it down, 
particularly against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices declined following a mixed performance overseas. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery 
settled at $399.60 an ounce, down $2.90 from late Friday. Republic National 
Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $399.75, off $3.25 from Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Although domestic and most European markets reopened Tuesday, trading was 
described as thin as Tokyo extended the New Year's Day holiday and many offices 
in New York and abroad remained partially staffed. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, currency dealers said, it remained to be seen whether the dollar was 
on its way up again after an extended decline in the last weeks of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was selling at 146.15 Japanese yen in London late Tuesday, up from 
143.40 in Tokyo last Friday. In New York, the dollar soared to 146.40 yen from 
143.85 yen. 
</P>
<P>
In London, one British pound cost $1.6115 late Tuesday, unchanged from Friday. 
Sterling fetched $1.6085 in New York, less than Friday's $1.6105. 
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Crude Oil, Gas Up; Precious Metals Fall 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil and gasoline prices rose sharply, as did orange juice futures, while 
precious metals fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil and gasoline rose in reaction to production slowdowns, plus 
technically triggered buy signals. 
</P>
<P>
Spot unleaded gasoline soared nearly 4 cents a gallon on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange to 65.69 cents, while the spot price of benchmark West 
Texas Intermediate crude surged $1.07 a barrel to $22.89. 
</P>
<P>
Energy traders said gasoline futures started the rally as traders bought 
unleaded gasoline and sold heating oil. Forecasts for milder weather across the 
United States, which would reduce heating oil demand, encouraged selling, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's crop-damaging freeze has left Florida, but orange juice futures 
continued higher out of fear the damage will produce shortages and higher cash 
prices, traders said. Florida produces about 70% of the U.S. citrus crop. 
</P>
<P>
Frozen concentrated orange juice futures traded on the New York Cotton Exchange 
rose the 8-cent-per-pound daily limit again in deferred contracts. Spot January 
was up 4.60 cents at 170.25. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. shortages spurred Brazil, a leading orange juice exporter, to raise 
prices, adding fuel to the futures rally, traders said.

The Mirror Maker: Stories &amp; Essays by Primo Levi, translated by Raymond 
Rosenthal (Schocken Books: $16.95, 176 pages) 
</P>
<P>
A radio talk show on KCRW-FM recently devoted two hours to a debate on Woody 
Allen's eminently debatable film, "Crimes and Misdemeanors." The participants 
included a film critic, a rabbi and a New York psychoanalyst who appears in the 
motion picture in the role of the immigrant professor who delivers a message of 
courage, dignity and hope in the face of a cruel and senseless world -- and 
then, tragically and inexplicably, takes his own life by jumping out the 
window. All of the panelists referred to the figure of the doomed European 
intellectual as "the Primo Levi character." 
</P>
<P>
The real Primo Levi, of course, was an Italian-Jewish chemist who survived 
Auschwitz, chronicled the experience of the Holocaust in a series of brilliant 
memoirs and novels, and then, only three years ago, threw himself down the 
stairwell of his apartment building in Turin, Italy. And so we approach "The 
Mirror Maker," a posthumous anthology of Levi's poems, stories and essays, with 
both reverence and deep, urgent curiosity: Is there a clue in these pages to 
the suicide of a Holocaust survivor whose work came to be regarded as a 
stirring affirmation of life in the face of death and despair? 
</P>
<P>
In no sense, of course, did Levi intend the "The Mirror Maker" to be a suicide 
note. These short pieces first appeared in "La Stampa," a Turin newspaper to 
which Levi contributed from time to time over the last 25 years of his life. 
And so the book, by its very nature, is modest in scale and ambition; few of 
these pieces exceed two or three pages in length, and many of them are simply 
the author's passing reflections on the headlines -- an early Apollo mission, 
the scandal over the spiking of Austrian wines with antifreeze, the publication 
of a book about gossip, the negotiations over nuclear disarmament -- or his 
musings on Horace, Kafka, Jack London, the importance of rhyme in poetry. 
</P>
<P>
"I beg the reader not to go in search of messages," Levi writes in the 
introduction to "The Mirror Maker," which was published in its original Italian 
edition during his lifetime. "I'm a normal man with a good memory who fell into 
a maelstrom and out of it more by luck than by virtue, and who from that time 
on has preserved a certain curiosity about maelstroms large and small, 
metaphorical and actual." 
</P>
<P>
But Levi's memory is too powerful, too vivid, and too persistent for us to 
dismiss even his most ephemeral writing. Aside from the occasional piece that 
may be regarded as inconsequential or merely unsuccessful, the book is nothing 
less than a contemplation of moral order in the universe. In that sense, it is 
a fitting coda to such enduring and important work as "Survival in Auschwitz" 
and "The Awakening." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the memory of Auschwitz -- that is, the memory of suffering, both 
spiritual and physical -- haunts all of Levi's writing, and flashes of the 
Holocaust illuminate "The Mirror Maker" like heat lightning. Thus, for example, 
Levi is referring to the Apollo mission and Auschwitz when he writes, both in 
joy and despair: "We are driven by atavistic impulses, and by reason, and at 
the same time by a 'cheerful strength,' so that, if an enterprise can be 
accomplished, be it good or evil, it cannot be set aside but must be carried 
through." 
</P>
<P>
His stories of fantasy and science fiction, I felt, were the least successful. 
Levi gives us a comic encounter between an Earthling and a visitor from another 
planet ("He wanted to know at what age clothes begin to develop"); he devotes 
several short pieces to imaginary interviews with animals: a gull, a mole, even 
a form of intestinal bacteria called E. coli ("Now bear with me for a moment, 
I'm in mitosis. . . ."). But even these stories offer moments when Levi's 
horrific experiences in the real world add a kind of poignancy and resonance to 
his wildest imaginings -- a young girl who sprouts wings and learns to fly; or 
an imprisoned alchemist who discovers how to pass through solid matter and then 
merges with the body of his lover "into a perpetual night of impossibility." 
</P>
<P>
Several of the essays in "The Mirror Maker" are explicitly concerned with the 
meaning and memory of the Holocaust. Levi eulogizes the fighters of the Warsaw 
Ghetto: "They have demonstrated that even when everything is lost, it is 
granted to man to save, together with his own dignity, that of future 
generations." And he condemns the revisionism of contemporary German historians 
who seek to minimize the crimes of the Holocaust by comparing Nazi genocide to 
the Soviet gulag: 
</P>
<P>
"That 'the gulag came before Auschwitz' is true; but one cannot forget that the 
aims of the two infernos were not the same," Levi retorts. "The first was a 
massacre among peers; it was not based on racial primacy and did not divide 
humanity into supermen and submen. . . . This contempt for the fundamental 
equality of rights among all human beings is shown by a mass of symbolic 
details, starting with the Auschwitz tattoo and going all the way to the use in 
the gas chambers of the poison originally produced to disinfest the holds of 
ships invaded by rats." 
</P>
<P>
As in his other recent writing, Levi invokes his own career in the field of 
chemistry as a context in which to consider the morality of science, the 
possibility of miracles, and the order -- or lack thereof -- of the universe. 
"It seems strange to me that varnishes are displacing Auschwitz as the 'ground 
floor' of my memory," Levi writes of his special expertise as an industrial 
chemist. "I realize this from my dreams, from which the Lager has disappeared 
and in which, with increasing frequency, I am faced with a varnish maker's 
problem that I cannot solve." 
</P>
<P>
Here, I believe, may be a clue to Levi's decision to take his own life. Despite 
his strongest instincts and loftiest aspirations -- "In my writing, for good or 
evil, knowingly or not, I've always tried to pass from the darkness into the 
light" -- Levi, at the age of 67, despaired at finding himself in a world where 
the lapse of collective memory threatens to obliterate even Auschwitz. Perhaps 
it was that "varnish maker's problem" that drove the survivor to suicide.

<P>
Seeking to sharpen up your videotapes? Consider SensorLight, a cordless 
camcorder light that, its manufacturers say, can double the time of similar 
rechargeable units, providing up to 40 minutes of illumination. 
</P>
<P>
Recently introduced by Sima Products Corp., a Skokie, Ill., manufacturer of 
video and photographic products, SensorLight also features a built-in computer 
circuit that reads the light in an area and adjusts the brightness to produce 
the right illumination for sharp videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
It attaches to a camcorder shoe-mount and is powered by a rechargeable 
six-volt, nickel-cadmium power pack. It also can run on any of the Sony-type 
camcorder batteries and comes with a UL-approved battery charger. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested retail for SensorLight is $179.95. It's available nationally at video 
stores and electronics specialty outlets. In the Los Angeles area, you can find 
it at Adray's, Dow Stereo, Fedco and Rogersound Labs. If you can't locate 
SensorLight in your area, contact Sima Products Corp.. 8707 N. Skokie Blvd., 
Skokie, Ill. 60077; phone, (312) 679-7462.

Getting a Lock on Household Repairs 
</P>
<P>
If you have some fixing up to do around the house and plan to use your 
battery-powered, cordless screwdriver, you might also want to have a LockBit, a 
key-less drill-chuck. It holds conventional round drill bits up to 1/4-inch in 
diameter, so you can use the screwdriver as a drill. 
</P>
<P>
Manufactured by WorkTools Inc., the LockBit, with its hex shank, fits all the 
popular cordless screwdrivers, its manufacturer says. 
</P>
<P>
The LockBit is available by mail order from WorkTools for $7.50, which includes 
shipping and handling. Contact WorkTools Inc., 20759 Plummer St., Chatsworth, 
Calif. 91311; phone, (818) 407-1503.

Smoking Out New Year's Resolutions 
</P>
<P>
Did a friend or relative just make a New Year's resolution to quit smoking? You 
might offer some help with the CigArrest Stop Smoking Starter Kit, which sells 
for a little more than a carton of smokes. 
</P>
<P>
The money-back-guaranteed CigArrest kit is nonprescription and has no nicotine 
products. It includes 15 smoking deterrent tablets (containing lobeline 
sulfate, which is derived from the tobacco plant and mimics tobacco's effects, 
although it's nonaddictive), seven multivitamin pills, a behavior modification 
audio tape and a manual with tips on how to stop smoking in seven days. 
</P>
<P>
A sample piece of smoking alternative gum is also included by the manufacturer, 
More Direct Health Products of Carlsbad. The kit retails for $19.95; a 24-piece 
packet of gum, $9.95. Additional packages of 15 tablets and 42 vitamins are 
sold separately for $9.95 each. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles area, the kits can be found at K mart, Fedco, CVS, Longs and 
Sav-on drugstores and Alpha Beta markets. If you can't find them in your area 
contact CigArrest marketing firm, Advantage Life Products, 26051 Merit Circle, 
Laguna Hills 92654. California residents may call (714) 582-0035; out-of-state, 
(800) 548-8663. 
</P>
<P>
Take a Swing at Better Putting 
</P>
<P>
An Arizona firm has introduced Putt-Par-Fectour, a new indoor device to help 
golfers practice and improve their putting. 
</P>
<P>
It's endorsed by PGA tour pro Don Pooley, who ranked Nos. 2 and 1 in 1987 and 
'88, and tied for third in '89 in the golf association's putting statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Pooley said the device helps putting alignment and perfects a consistent 
stroke. 
</P>
<P>
The putting board has a five-foot long, simulated grass surface with a steel 
base that can be raised on one end to simulate longer putts. White edges on the 
sides of the board are used as guides to keep the putter blade on a parallel 
path throughout the stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Putt-Par-Fectour costs $39.95, plus $5.75 for shipping and handling, and can be 
ordered from Align-Rite Co., 1942 E. 17th St., Tucson, Ariz., 85719; phone, 
(602) 624-4438. LYNN SIMROSS

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: ALCOHOL AFFECTS CHILDREN, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What does it mean to grow up as a child of an alcoholic parent? Here's a chance 
to compare your views with those of some experts. True or false? 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Most children of alcoholics, having seen what alcoholism can do, shun 
drinking themselves. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Children of alcoholics tend to put great emphasis on control in their own 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- As adults, children of alcoholics are no more vulnerable to illness than 
others. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- A child's having to feel responsible for parents isn't such a bad thing. 
</P>
<P>
5 -- Neglect, broken promises and inconsistency are usually the worst problems 
associated with homes where one or both parents are alcoholic. 
</P>
<P>
6 -- If an adult child's parents are still getting into trouble with alcohol, 
the child should help them. 
</P>
<P>
7 -- Because children of alcoholics have usually lived with lies, they're often 
scrupulously honest. 
</P>
<P>
8 -- So much damage has been done to children of alcoholics that support groups 
are generally less effective than with other victims of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWERS: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- FALSE. More than half of all alcoholics have at least one alcoholic 
parent. While some children of alcoholics are violently opposed to drink, 30% 
of children raised by alcoholic parents become or marry alcoholics. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- TRUE. Many adult children of alcoholics fear that if they don't maintain 
tight control, they'll become like their parents. They put an extraordinary 
emphasis on control of anger and emotions. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- FALSE. Children of alcoholics are more vulnerable to many stress 
illnesses. As children, they're more likely to be bed-wetters, to be 
hyperactive and asthmatic, and as adults, they tend to have ulcers, colitis, 
migraines and bulimia. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- FALSE. Children who grow up having to feel responsible for their parents 
almost always have difficulties with intimacy. The overly responsible child 
doesn't learn how to play, to be spontaneous and to share in decision making. 
</P>
<P>
5 -- FALSE. Violence, incest and sexual abuse are three times more common in 
alcoholic households than in the general population. 
</P>
<P>
6 -- FALSE. One way to help break the destructive pattern is for the child to 
stop covering up for the parents' drink-induced behavior. 
</P>
<P>
7 -- FALSE. Unfortunately, lying frequently becomes a way of life, and as 
adults, these children often lie when it may be just as easy to tell the truth. 
</P>
<P>
8 -- FALSE. Alateen, a support group for the children of alcoholics, Al-Anon, 
for adults with alcoholic relatives or friends, and ACA, Adult Children of 
Alcoholics, are effective in helping victims recognize the disease. 
</P>
<P>
If you answered six of these questions correctly, you're better informed than 
most on this subject.

DON'T IGNORE SINUSITIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I went to my doctor because I wasn't feeling well, and he told me 
that I had a case of sinusitis. 
</P>
<P>
He also seemed concerned that I had waited as long as I had before making an 
appointment to speak with him. I'm not a hero, and if I had a pain in my chest 
or anything like that I'd get myself to an emergency room as soon as possible. 
But I don't think that a case of sinusitis is in the same ballpark. Why is it 
such a big deal? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Sinusitis can be a serious infection. Under some circumstances, for 
example, it can lead to brain abscesses.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: POP MUSIC; 
</P>
<P>
HIGHER TICKET PRICES, OK, BUT COUNTRY DICK AS MAYOR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD

<TEXT>
<P>
What's in store for the San Diego pop-music scene in the 1990s? Here are my 
predictions: 
</P>
<P>
* The price of concert tickets will continue to go up, with the average cost 
doubling to $40 by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
* We're going to see a lot more pay-per-view concerts on cable TV as more and 
more superstars limit their tours to the major markets. 
</P>
<P>
* Due to the proliferation of oldies acts hitting the road, there will be a 
trend toward packaging three to five has-beens together under a common theme, 
such as a British Invasion package, a Motown package, a Summer of Love package. 
</P>
<P>
* San Diego's original-music scene will enjoy a brief renaissance, just as it 
did in the early 1980s, and produce another crop of talented bands capable of 
drawing standing-room-only nightclub crowds. Inevitably, however, public 
interest will soon fade, prompting most of these bands to either break up or 
flee to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
* Home-grown bands will not only continue to release their own records, tapes 
and CDs, but will start putting out self-produced videos as well. Of course, 
local TV will ignore these, just as local radio has long ignored these records, 
tapes and CDs. 
</P>
<P>
Here's what some of the San Diego pop scene's veteran movers and shakers 
predict will happen in the coming decade: 
</P>
<P>
* Bill Silva, concert promoter, Bill Silva Presents: "In the 1990s, I believe 
that eventually -- probably sooner than later -- a major outdoor concert 
facility will be constructed that will create a whole new market for upper-end 
artists. I also think you're going to see more special events, like Street 
Scene, and better packages of two or three big artists. The public is no longer 
as excited about going to concerts as they were 10 or 15 years ago, and 
therefore it's going to take a special event to entice them to spend the big 
bucks to see a show." 
</P>
<P>
* David Swift, concert promoter, Avalon Attractions: "I expect the economy will 
slow down and, as a result, there will be fewer shows, and some of the bigger 
bands might be playing smaller venues. The free-wheeling spending days of the 
yuppies are coming to an end, so we as promoters are going to have to be more 
cautious about what we book. If we don't, we're going to be in trouble, because 
with people spending less and saving more, it's going to be harder to get them 
to go to shows." 
</P>
<P>
* Kenny Weissberg, concert promoter, Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay: "I think 
the pop-jazz phenomenon that has been our bread and butter for the last eight 
years will wane in popularity by 1992 and that people will start turning out 
more and more for music from other cultures -- world-beat music -- from places 
like Brazil, Africa and the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
* Phil Quinn, vice president and general manager of the San Diego Sports Arena: 
"I know 1990 will be extremely busy in the concert scene, judging from what 
we've got coming up, starting in February and continuing through the summer. As 
for the rest of the decade, I don't know, but I think there will always be that 
desire to see the performer live. Our own plans are to build a new arena 
downtown, with 22,000 seats, by 1993, and I'm hoping that's going to entice 
more bigger acts to come down here in the future." 
</P>
<P>
* Dave Hodges, owner, Belly Up Tavern: "My prediction is the Beat Farmers will 
make it so big that Country Dick (Montana) opens a chain of small, rowdy 
nightclubs and provides young, upcoming garage bands with a place to expand 
their knowledge and further their endeavors. These will be the future bands of 
the Belly Up Tavern." 
</P>
<P>
* Buddy Blue, leader of San Diego blue-eyed soul group the Jacks: The local 
original-music scene "has to get better because it can't get any worse. I'm 
hoping we'll see better bands, better clubs, better fans." 
</P>
<P>
* Country Dick Montana, drummer with San Diego roots rockers the Beat Farmers: 
"I predict that I will become mayor of San Diego. We will secede from the union 
and become the entertainment capital of the world. Our high-powered glitz and 
sleaze will make Las Vegas look like Salt Lake City in comparison." 
</P>
<P>
* Robert Vaughn, leader of local rock band Robert Vaughn and the Shadows: 
"Acoustic instruments and pure American rock 'n' roll will be the thing of the 
1990s. Everyone's burned out with the sterile, plastic '80s -- the wimpy 
synthesizer, pop, the blond-haired heavy-metal bass players, the discos where 
deejays are stars, all the Spandex, all the posing." 
</P>
<P>
* Mojo Nixon, one-half of San Diego's manic-talkin' blues duo, Mojo Nixon and 
Skid Roper: "I think we're going to see the demise of the Spirit and the 
opening of Country Dick's Libation City. I think the Bacchanal will eventually 
take over the entire shopping plaza where they're at, and the Belly Up Tavern 
will have to move to the Miramar Naval Air Station so people can make as much 
noise as they damn well want. I also predict that Jose Sinatra will become a 
giant star and become the heir-apparent to the Liberace tradition." 
</P>
<P>
* Bartley Mendoza, leader of local mod group Manuel Scan: "I predict the 
perseverance of a lot of San Diego's top original bands will finally pay off 
and you're going to see an explosion of local talent on vinyl that's going to 
take off nationwide. I also think pointy shoes will make a major comeback." 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: There's a good chance that Aerosmith and Skid Row's upcoming U.S. 
tour will include a March 2 stop at the San Diego Sports Arena. . . . Laurie 
Anderson has just been booked to play Symphony Hall downtown Feb. 15, with 
tickets scheduled to go on sale at 10 a.m. Jan. 15. It's the avant-garde 
performance artist's first San Diego appearance in six years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tickets go on sale at 3 p.m. Friday for two upcoming shows at the California 
Theatre downtown: the Jesus and Mary Chain, Feb. 2, and the Smithereens, Feb. 
7. Tickets go on sale at 10 a.m. Saturday for Motley Crue's Feb. 11 concert at 
the Sports Arena. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: the Psychedelic Furs and East of Eden, 
tonight at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa; Rosie Flores, Friday at the Belly Up 
Tavern in Solana Beach; the Walking Wounded, also Friday, at the Casbah; 
Delaney Bramlett, Saturday at the Belly Up Tavern; and the Neville Brothers, 
Saturday and Sunday at the Bacchanal.

All-Led Zeppelin Format: A Florida radio station has switched to what it claims 
-- and who would doubt them? -- is the world's only all-Led Zeppelin radio 
format. WKRL-FM in Clearwater made the cutover on New Year's Day after spending 
New Year's Eve repeatedly playing the 1971 hit "Stairway to Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Led Zeppelin is "just a very, very strong classic rock group, very prolific and 
engaging," said Daniel DiLoreto, manager of WKRL, which until Monday was the 
Tampa area's "only classic rock station." The new format is so restrictive that 
even solo efforts from members of the now-defunct British band will not be 
aired. The group released 10 albums over a 12-year period, and broke up in 
December, 1980, after drummer John Bonham died of an alcohol overdose. Shauna

Paintings, Furniture Stolen: Thieves raided an Italian villa designated to 
house a collection of the Guggenheim Foundation, stealing four paintings and a 
piece of furniture valued at $115,000, police said Tuesday. The stolen 
paintings were not part of the 110-piece collection of minimal and conceptual 
art, mostly by U.S. artists, which will be donated to the American foundation 
by Giuseppe Panza di Biumo.Shauna Snow

Professor Griff's Solo Debut: A solo debut album by Professor Griff, the 
controversial Public Enemy "community liaison" coordinator, will include a 
recording of the May 22 Washington Times interview in which Griff (real name: 
Richard Griffin) declared that Jews are responsible for the "majority of evil" 
in the world, starting a swarm of debate around the New York rap group. Griff's 
album, titled "Pawn in the Game," is scheduled to be released Feb. 21 (the same 
day as Public Enemy's new "Fear of a Black Planet" album) by Miami-based Luke 
Skywalker records, best known for releasing sexually explicit recordings by the 
group 2 Live Crew. 
</P>
<P>
Griff's title song will be released as a single on Jan. 15. Public Enemy leader 
Chuck D has not been involved with Griff's record, though the group's Flavor 
Flav has contributed. Shauna Snow

<P>
The federal government provided details on the biggest real estate clearance 
sale in history Tuesday, listing everything from the $75-million Hyatt Grand 
Champions hotel near Palm Springs to a $21,000 home in Pittsburg, Tex., among a 
vast collection of 30,000 properties for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The Resolution Trust Corp., the agency created to sell assets of failed 
thrifts, unveiled its first full inventory of properties obtained by the 
government as a result of the seizure of 281 financially crippled savings and 
loan associations. The S&amp;Ls had foreclosed on the real estate when loans 
went bad. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government is selling the properties to recover some of the nearly 
$300 billion that will be spent on disposing of defunct S&amp;Ls and paying off 
depositors. 
</P>
<P>
The list includes such diverse holdings as the Rusty Pelican restaurant in 
Tempe, Ariz.; the Chandeleur Harbor marina near New Orleans and a $4-million 
mansion in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
"The inventory contains approximately 12,000 single-family homes, 2,500 
commercial properties and 800 parcels of undeveloped land," said David C. 
Cooke, RTC executive director. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our first substantial marketing effort and reflects only a portion of 
the assets the RTC will ultimately have in its inventory," he said. 
"Nonetheless, its size reflects the magnitude of the challenges for the RTC and 
the opportunities for buyers that lie ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Release of the list has been widely anticipated, as the RTC has received 22,000 
inquiries from people interested in bidding on properties. The RTC is hiring 
thousands of people to manage the sales; negotiations for some sales have 
already begun. 
</P>
<P>
The list issued Tuesday is just the first installment. The RTC is expected to 
take control of at least 200 more S&amp;Ls, which own a vast array of shopping 
centers, office buildings, retail stores, condominiums, single family houses 
and raw land. No one knows the total number of properties that will eventually 
be offered for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The computerized tally fills nearly 3,000 pages in four volumes and includes 
30,000 listings, including in some cases each dock slip in a marina and each 
apartment in a big condominium development. 
</P>
<P>
The listings include a brief description of each asset and an estimated price. 
However, many listings contain the initials TBD, "to be determined," an 
indication that the value of the property is highly uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Selling the properties will be a daunting task for RTC officials and local real 
estate agents or auctioneers hired by the government. They hope to collect as 
much revenue as possible as quickly as possible without causing local real 
estate markets to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government will issue a strategic plan for the RTC today, directing 
the agency to act rapidly to sell properties and generate revenue. 
</P>
<P>
However, the S&amp;L rescue legislation that created the RTC also mandated that 
sale prices should be at least 95% of local market value. Realistic values may 
be particularly hard to determine in sections of Texas, Oklahoma and Colorado, 
where real estate markets have been depressed for years. 
</P>
<P>
Texas, Colorado and Arizona are heavily represented in the RTC inventory. 
California has a comparative handful of listings, although it has some of the 
highest-priced: the $75-million Hyatt Grand at Indian Wells near Palm Springs 
and a $4-million, 19-room house in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the more expensive properties include the Scottsdale Camelback Resort 
Hotel near Phoenix, $17 million; Parkwood Professional Plaza, a medical office 
building in Phoenix, $4.2 million; Orchard Pointe, an office building in 
Englewood, Colo., $9.3 million; Skymark Tower, an office building with polished 
marble floors in Arlington, Tex., $5.5 million; Regency Plaza, a 16-story 
office building in Dallas, $13 million; the Bexar Savings Building in San 
Antonio, $19 million; a mini-mall in Jasper, Tex., $14.5 million, and the 
Ramada Hotel in Pompano Beach, Fla., $6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
A wide variety of commercial property is available for sale. Chandeleur Harbor 
marina in New Orleans, with 89 wet slips, 34 boat sheds, a bait shop and six 
gas pumps, is priced at $2.8 million. Boat slips are available at $4,400 each 
in Dock 11 at League City, Tex. The Odessa Car Wash in Odessa, Tex., carries a 
$120,000 price tag. 
</P>
<P>
Four pages of restaurant listings are offered. The Rusty Pelican in Tempe, 
Ariz., is priced at $1.9 million, and the Captain's Walk in Hot Springs, Ark., 
is listed at $199,500. The Hickory House in Perry, Kan., is up for $35,000, and 
the Lost Dutchman in Elk City, Okla., is available for $125,000. But no price 
has been set for the Dairy Queen in Woodland Park, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC's four-volume inventory sells for $50. The commercial and land volumes 
are priced at $10 each, while the two residential volumes sell for $30. The 
toll-free telephone number for ordering is (800) 431-0600. 
</P>
<P>
Although federal law requires the RTC to issue a revised inventory every six 
months, Cooke said his agency will begin making asset information available on 
a more frequent basis. The RTC plans to establish an Asset Information Center 
offering special services such as a listing of properties for sale in 
particular cities.

JAPAN SAID TO FEEL PRESSURE TO LIMIT AUTO PLANT GROWTH 
</P>

<P>
In an unusually aggressive display of its power over Japan's auto industry, the 
Japanese government is pressuring the nation's auto companies to refrain from 
expanding their manufacturing operations in Japan for fear of further damaging 
trade relations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese auto industry officials say the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry, the government agency largely responsible for Japanese industrial 
policy, is working hard to stop some of the nation's biggest auto makers from 
building new assembly plants in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Japanese auto executives say they want to expand only in order to 
satisfy the soaring demand for new cars in Japan's booming domestic market -- 
and have no plans to use the additional car-making capacity to increase exports 
-- Japanese government officials apparently believe that the expansion will put 
pressure on at least some Japanese companies to ship more cars overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The government is trying to reduce the industry's reliance on exports and to 
encourage more balanced trade patterns in the auto sector -- which is still the 
largest single contributor to America's trade deficit with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
While Japanese passenger car exports to the United States are limited to 2.3 
million a year under quotas imposed by the Japanese government, the Japanese 
have been shipping fewer than that in recent years because they have shifted 
much of their auto production to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Japanese government still apparently believes that any increase in 
direct exports would cause a furor in America. Hagime Ito, deputy director of 
MITI's automobile division, noted in a recent interview that he thinks it would 
be "politically risky" for Japan to drop its restrictions on exports to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials have not publicly announced their anti-growth campaign, 
and few auto industry executives are willing to openly discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
But the government's new policy so far seems to have had its biggest impact on 
Mazda, Japan's fourth-largest auto maker. So, not surprisingly, Mazda officials 
have been more vocal in their complaints than executives at the other Japanese 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
The Hiroshima-based auto maker is upset about the government's efforts because 
Mazda has just begun a long-range strategic program to dramatically expand its 
presence in the Japanese home market. 
</P>
<P>
Mazda has just passed Honda to become the third-best-selling car line in Japan. 
Now, the stunning growth of the overall Japanese market -- sales have 
skyrocketed to 7.2 million cars and trucks in 1989, up from just 6 million two 
years ago -- has enticed Mazda to set some ambitious targets for the 1990s. The 
company's goal is to nearly double its Japanese sales, from roughly 480,000 in 
1989 to 800,000 by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
To meet that target, Mazda has decided to expand production at its modern 
assembly complex at Hofu in southwestern Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The government tried to persuade Mazda to cancel its Hofu expansion. But Mazda 
responded by agreeing instead to suspend operations at one of its older 
assembly lines in Hiroshima at the same time it completes its expansion at Hofu 
in 1992. However, Mazda has no plans to lay off any workers in Hiroshima, 
because the company is already struggling with a labor shortage. 
</P>
<P>
"MITI is advising the auto makers not to expand facilities, so we have decided 
to expand in Hofu and close down in Hiroshima," Mazda spokesman Atsuo Katada 
said. "Basically, we will suspend some of the old facilities in order to expand 
our new facilities," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the government's fears of additional domestic manufacturing come at 
a time when many of the largest Japanese auto makers are also planning to 
dramatically expand their operations in the United States and Europe. Nissan, 
Toyota, Honda and Mazda have all announced plans to increase the number of 
U.S.-made cars and auto parts they send back to Japan from their American 
factories in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Most notably, Nissan has altered its long-range strategic plans to rely more 
heavily on U.S.-built cars and trucks to meet its sales targets in the American 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan has been depending on Japanese imports for roughly two-thirds of its 
sales in the United States, with the remainder coming from its big assembly 
complex in Smyrna, Tenn., where Nissan produces light trucks and subcompact 
cars. But the company has announced plans to expand its Smyrna factory to turn 
it into the largest single auto plant in the United States. With the extra U.S. 
car production capacity, Nissan expects that, by the mid-1990s, two out of 
every three vehicles it sells in America will be built in the United States, 
according to Kiyofumi Morimoto, a Nissan managing director. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now moving from a two-to-one ratio in favor of imports compared to cars 
from Smyrna, to a one-to-one ratio between imports and Smyrna," Morimoto said. 
"We hope in the future it will be two-to-one in favor of Smyrna."

RIVAL ATHLETIC SHOE MAKERS FORMED AN ALLIANCE TO BATTLE COUNTERFEITS 
</P>

<P>
When U.S. Customs officials in Arizona called Van Doren Rubber Co. last August 
to notify the company that a shipment of counterfeit Vans athletic shoes had 
been seized, officials at the Orange-based company were not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the company know its goods were being counterfeited, it had 
already joined forces with two competitors -- Reebok and Converse -- in an 
unprecedented joint investigation to find out who was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
The international probe involved a remarkable degree of cooperation among three 
rivals in the fiercely competitive athletic shoe business and among law 
enforcement officials in the United States Mexico, and Chile, according to 
attorneys involved in the case. 
</P>
<P>
It culminated in Friday's indictment of 18 individuals, including eight San 
Diego residents and three South Korean businessmen, on charges of trafficking 
in counterfeit goods, money laundering and making false statements to customs 
authorities. The conspirators allegedly sold millions of pairs of counterfeit 
sneakers bearing the labels of Reebok, Converse, Vans, L.A. Gear and others 
through two rings in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen M. McNamee, U.S. Attorney for the district of Phoenix, said the 
criminal investigation began in August when Mexican customs agents refused to 
allow the importation of a shipment of athletic shoes from Korea. U.S. Customs 
agents at the international port of entry in Nogales, Ariz., examined the 
rejected goods and found sneakers with the "Vans" label in boxes indicating 
that they were manufactured in Korea. 
</P>
<P>
But Vans shoes are all made by the Van Doren Rubber Co. at its plant in Orange, 
and customs agents notified the company that they had seized what appeared to 
be counterfeit goods. Vans, in the meantime, was engaged in a private 
investigation of counterfeiting in conjunction with Reebok and Converse, and 
the three firms were able to provide valuable information to law enforcement 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was spearheaded by New York attorney Harley I. Lewin, who 
initially had been retained by Reebok. Converse eventually joined in the 
investigation after discussions among the attorneys. Vans became involved when 
it asked its local attorney to look into the counterfeiting problem, and the 
attorney approached Lewin. 
</P>
<P>
"Counterfeiting is expensive for us," said Richard Leeuwenburg, president of 
Van Doren."It costs us well in excess of $1 million a year." 
</P>
<P>
"They all decided it would be best to pool information," said Lewin. "Doing 
this kind of investigation, which involves attorneys and investigators in 
multiple countries, is very expensive." He declined to say how much had been 
spent by the three companies. 
</P>
<P>
Lewin said the investigation included substantial undercover work involving 
people posing as buyers and sellers of athletic shoes. That effort, combined 
with the efforts of Mexican customs authorities, brought about the arrest of 
Coronado residents Nathan and Marcos Betech in Mexico City last September. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, authorities in San Diego raided the Betech companies' offices 
there in response to civil lawsuits initiated by Lewin on behalf Reebok, 
Converse and Vans, and a federal judge subsequently ordered a freeze on all the 
assets of the Betech firms, known as Marnatech Enterprises Inc. and Conatech 
S.A. 
</P>
<P>
After the seizure of Vans shoes in August, customs authorities began closing in 
on a second ring, allegedly run by brothers Byron and Glenn McLaughlin of San 
Diego. Byron McLaughlin was arrested in San Diego on Nov. 28, and his brother 
was arrested the same day in Miami after being lured there from Chile by 
customs agents posing as shoe buyers, according to an account of the case 
provided by Reebok. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday and Friday, additional warrants were served and arrests made in 
various U.S. cities and in Mexico and Chile. About $4.5 million in assets has 
been seized in connection with the case, according to the U.S. Attorney's 
office. The money-laundering charges, which allege the transfer of funds for 
criminal purposes, extended the reach of the investigation as far as 
Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
The case appears to be one of the first in which the money-laundering statutes, 
which are aimed primarily at drug dealers, have been used against 
counterfeiters, McNamee said.

FIRM SAYS IT WAS A 'STRAW MAN' IN LINCOLN DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;LS: A BUSINESSMAN SAYS HE SIGNED DOCUMENTS FOR A $14-MILLION LAND DEAL 
MERELY AS A FAVOR FOR A FRIEND.

<P>
An Arizona businessman testified in a federal court Tuesday that his small real 
estate investment company was a "straw man" in a $14-million land transaction 
involving Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Acosta, who was president of Westcontinental Mortgage &amp; Investment 
in Tucson, said his limited partnership was too small to buy the property and 
that he simply signed documents without reading them to help his friend, 
Lincoln borrower Ernest C. Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta's testimony prompted U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin to question the 
safety and soundness of the loans that Westcon received. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta was the third witness to testify for the government in a hearing to test 
the evidence that federal regulators used to justify the April 14 takeover of 
Irvine-based Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Sporkin is taking testimony on four transactions that regulators claim typify 
the failure of Lincoln's parent, American Continental Corp. in Phoenix, to 
operate the S&amp;L safely and soundly and conserve assets. He expects to hear 
from American Continental executives, including its controversial chairman, 
Charles H. Keating Jr., during the next three days. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental claims that regulators lacked sufficient evidence to show 
that Lincoln was operating unsafely and unsoundly and was substantially 
dissipating assets. American Continental had filed for bankruptcy protection 
the day before Lincoln was seized. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of Lincoln could become the nation's single biggest thrift 
failure, with taxpayers forced to pay more than $2 billion to bail out the 
S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
The government's case before Sporkin was jolted Friday when regulators learned 
that Garcia, the key witness in the Westcon transaction and another deal, would 
exercise his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refuse to 
testify in the civil proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
But James P. Murphy and Paul E. Gutermann, lawyers for the Office of Thrift 
Supervision, said they still expect to show that regulators had sufficient 
information to seize Lincoln. They expect to use Garcia's deposition last March 
in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of American Continental 
to bolster their case. 
</P>
<P>
That deposition, along with a Westcon letter admitting that the firm held the 
property as a straw owner, provided regulators with the "smoking gun" they were 
looking for to seal their rationale for seizing Lincoln, according to the 
testimony of Kevin T. O'Connell, an executive at OTS, the nation's thrift 
regulatory agency. 
</P>
<P>
But John C. Luntin, a Phoenix attorney for American Continental, said the 
documents were not the smoking gun and, in fact, showed that the Westcon deal 
was not a sham transaction, as O'Connell claimed. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators claim that developer Garcia needed a loan to buy back an 80% 
interest in his firm that he had previously sold, but Lincoln would supply the 
money only if he bought a vacant parcel in a master-planned community southwest 
of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia did not want to buy the property but arranged for Westcon to buy it on 
March 30, 1987. And he loaned Westcon the $3.5-million down payment from 
Lincoln funds he received, regulators claim. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta said he agreed to be a "nominee" as an "accommodation" to his friend, 
who wanted the property off the books of E. C. Garcia &amp; Co. Acosta said no 
payments were expected because the property was supposed to go back to Garcia 
within 90 days, but it wasn't until more than a year later that Westcon was 
able to get Garcia to take it back. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta testified that he never read the documents he signed, never knew who 
owned the property, never learned what the documents were and never knew that 
he even had received $3.5 million from Garcia and transferred it at the same 
time to Lincoln as a down payment. The judge was concerned that Lincoln would 
make a $10.5-million loan for the balance of the purchase price to Westcon, 
which couldn't pay it back. "It might be considered to be unsafe or unsound," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Luntin, however, said after the court hearing that Lincoln didn't lend Westcon 
any money. The S&amp;L received $3.5 million in cash as a down payment and 
simply took a promissory note back for the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
The down payment, he said, came from Garcia's own pocket. Of the $20.2 million 
loaned to Garcia to purchase his company's stock, $19.6 million was wired 
directly to the seller, and the rest went to Lincoln as loan fees.

Bank of Boston to Write Off $300 Million: Bank of Boston Corp. said its 
earnings for the final quarter of 1989 will be reduced by about $300 million 
largely because of problem real estate loans and the uncertainty of the New 
England economy. The large regional banking company also said it added $280 
million to its loan-loss reserves to cover future losses. However, Bank of 
Boston said it expects to break even for the three months ended Dec. 31 and 
earn a profit for the full year.

ARGENTINA'S INFLATION STRATEGY GREETED WARILY; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AMERICA: HYPERINFLATION HAS RESURGED. BUT SOME FEAR THAT TIGHTENING THE 
MONEY SUPPLY MAY KINDLE A RECESSION.

The latest efforts by Argentina's government to rein in rampant inflation met 
mixed reviews Tuesday from local economists and business people. 
</P>
<P>
As a second wave of hyperinflation in the past six months threatened to cripple 
the country's economy, the government late Monday announced measures to shore 
up the crumbling currency, the austral, and to hold down short-term interest 
rates, which last week soared to 300% a month. 
</P>
<P>
Economy Minister Antonio Erman Gonzalez said the money supply will be 
restricted to support the austral, which lost nearly half its value against the 
U.S. dollar in December. 
</P>
<P>
"The announcements were absolutely clear. The markets will calm down 
gradually," said Argentine Chamber of Commerce President Carlos de la Vega. "We 
don't expect to return to normality in 48 hours after the past weekend's 
madness, but if everything works out we will be all right." 
</P>
<P>
But some worried that the government's moves would break the inflationary cycle 
by causing a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"We have tried this before. This is pure monetarism, and we know that it will 
lead us to a recession. This is not a clear sign for those who want to 
produce," said Jaime Goldenblum, a spokesman for a group of small and 
medium-sized industries. 
</P>
<P>
The government says December's inflation will top 50% and expects a similar 
figure for January. In August, President Carlos Menem had pledged to keep 
inflation down to 15% for all 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Many stores and supermarkets chose to remain closed Tuesday, uncertain about 
how financial markets will react to the new measures when they reopen today. 
</P>
<P>
Some economists said the government was on the right track. But others said 
further austerity measures would be needed to attack what is seen as the root 
of Argentina's economic problems: a massive fiscal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"Once again, thanks to President Menem's intuition, we are on the right path," 
said economist Alvaro Alsogaray, a leader of the small, right-wing Democratic 
Center Union party. 
</P>
<P>
"The measures address part of the problem of the fiscal deficit but they aren't 
enough to close that gap like the government expects them to," said Daniel 
Artana, chief economist at the Latin American Economic Research Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Artana said mounting inflation would erode the state's revenues and force the 
government to raise gasoline prices and public utility rates to quickly 
replenish its coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Menem has been trying to rekindle the trust that allowed him to bring monthly 
inflation down to 5.6% in October from nearly 200% in July, stepping up his 
privatization plans and seeking support from opposition parties. 
</P>
<P>
Trade unionists and politicians of the ruling Peronist party have warned that 
hyperinflation could spark new rioting in slum areas like the food riots that 
occurred shortly before Menem's inauguration in July, when 15 people were 
killed and scores injured.

Toys R Us Posts 22.7% Gain in Holiday Sales: Toys R Us Inc. said its sales 
jumped 22.7% to $2.02 billion during the eight-week Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
Nintendo video games, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures, Barbie and 
Batman products were particularly popular. The company's strong sales results 
were posted despite a generally weaker toy industry. The world's largest toy 
specialty retailing chain, which makes almost half its sales in the eight weeks 
leading up to Dec. 24, said revenue was up 10% on a same-store basis. In the 
year-ago period, Paramus, N.J.-based Toys R Us posted sales of $1.65 billion.

CAMPEAU GETS TWO MORE WEEKS TO NEGOTIATE NEW PACT WITH ITS LENDERS

Troubled Campeau Corp. won two extra weeks Tuesday to work out a new lending 
agreement with a banking syndicate that has provided $2.34 billion in financing 
to its two big department store divisions. 
</P>
<P>
A dispute between Campeau and the Citibank-led banking group had threatened to 
force Campeau's Allied Stores and Federated Department Stores operations to 
seek protection from creditors in bankruptcy court within days. 
</P>
<P>
Campeau officials, however, have conceded that Allied and Federated still might 
file to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code as early as 
this month even if it reaches new terms with its banks. 
</P>
<P>
Campeau's most pressing crisis was prompted by a Dec. 21 letter from Citibank 
asserting that the Allied and Federated lenders could force early repayment of 
the department store companies' bank debt unless they could demonstrate their 
solvency. Citibank had set a deadline of Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
The bank maintained that the Campeau units had fallen into technical default on 
their loans by failing to prove their solvency. Campeau has countered that it 
believes its big retailing units are complying with the loan agreement and are 
not in default. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement announced Tuesday, the banks said they would give Campeau 
until Jan. 15 to satisfy their conditions and promised not to call in the 
Allied and Federated loans before then. As part of the agreement, however, 
Federated said it will pay off early a $250-million loan originally due April 
30.

Di Giorgio Corp. said Tuesday that it has agreed to be acquired by a company 
headed by New Jersey investor Arthur M. Goldberg for $30 a share, or about $155 
million, ending a six-month struggle for control of the food distribution and 
building material company. 
</P>
<P>
Di Giorgio, based in San Francisco, said it had been unable to find another 
bidder who could top the offer from DIG Acquisition Corp., which is owned by

PURCHASERS' INDEX EDGES UP; MANUFACTURING STILL WEAK

Weakness persisted in the manufacturing sector during December but the pace of 
economic decline eased, the nation's purchasing managers reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Purchasing Management, which tracks economic trends by 
polling its members each month, said its index rose to 48% in December from 
46.6% in November. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the unexpectedly big improvement in the widely followed index -- which 
raised it to the highest level since June, 1989 -- the reading suggested that 
the economy still was in a slump. 
</P>
<P>
December marked the eighth-straight month in which the index has come in below 
the dividing line between economic growth and decline. A reading below 50 
generally means that the manufacturing economy is deteriorating, and a reading 
above 50 indicates that it is expanding. 
</P>
<P>
Financial markets keep tabs on the purchasing managers' monthly report on 
business for clues about economic health. Wall Street welcomed the December 
report, and the Dow Jones index of 30 industrial stocks surged 56.95 to a 
record close of 2,810.15, surpassing its previous peak of 2,791.41, reached 
Oct. 9. 
</P>
<P>
But the report was subject to varying interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
It was regarded by some observers as additional evidence that the feeble 
economy needs to be livened up with a dose of lower interest rates. It tended 
to support the notion that the Federal Reserve Board should nudge rates lower 
to stimulate economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the report was taken as a sign that the economic downturn 
may have bottomed out late last year. Some stock market analysts were cheered 
because they thought that the purchasing managers had handed them a reason for 
optimism about the fortunes of industrial companies, which have been held back 
by the sluggish economic conditions of the past year.

U.S. CAR, TRUCK SALES FALL 21.3% IN MID-MONTH

Sales of North American-made cars dropped 21.3% in mid-December from a year 
earlier, when consumers thronged to dealerships to take advantage of 
incentives, auto makers reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The eight major U.S. auto makers said they sold cars and light trucks at an 
average daily rate of 28,417 during the Dec. 11-20 period last year, compared 
to a rate of 34,921 during the same time the year before. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Three -- General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. -- 
were hit the hardest, with their sales falling 22% during the period. Sales 
during the period for autos made in the United States by foreign manufacturers 
mostly were higher. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of light trucks fell 14% during the period, bringing total vehicle sales 
down 18.6%. 
</P>
<P>
During December, 1988, consumers flocked to showrooms to buy vehicles before 
incentives expired on Dec. 31. That pushed the selling rate for mid- and 
late-December to its highest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Incentives also were in effect during December, 1989, but they didn't spark the 
same kind of demand as they did a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is you've got a tired market," said auto analyst Joseph Phillippi 
of Shearson Lehman Hutton of New York. "You're facing a market that's at least 
partially saturated." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, more than 77 million new cars and trucks have been sold in the 
United States, or about one for every three Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, experts say the slowdown of the U.S. economy has contributed to 
the auto industry slowdown, as consumers curtail or delay major purchases. 
</P>
<P>
"They've bought so many cars over the past five or six years and they are still 
paying for them," said analyst Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors Service Inc. 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's pretty weak right now," Sudol said. 
</P>
<P>
With just one 10-day sales period left in 1989, car and truck sales for the 
eight auto makers were 3.7% behind the 1988 pace. Domestic and overseas auto 
makers report their end-of-the-year sales figures Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Car sales for 1989 through Dec. 20 ran 4.8% behind the previous year, and truck 
sales were down 1.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's mid-December combined car and truck sales fell 25.2% from a year 
earlier. Ford's car sales were off 33.2%; light truck sales were down 12.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler's vehicle sales for mid-December were down 22.8%, with car sales 
falling 33.7% and light truck sales dropping 11.3%. 
</P>
<P>
GM car and truck sales fell 19.5% in mid-December, compared to a year earlier. 
Car sales fell 21.6%; truck sales were down 15.3%.

EASTERN CUTS FARES; SAVINGS ON MOST FLIGHTS 25% TO 45%

Eastern Airlines, in a bid to draw more passengers as it struggles to emerge 
from bankruptcy, said Tuesday that it will slash its fares on most domestic 
flights by 25% to 45% below the lowest industry rate. 
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is to maximize revenues on board the airplanes. This initiative 
is aimed at discretionary travelers," said George Brennan, vice president of 
the Texas Air Corp. unit. 
</P>
<P>
"Excluding flights from the Northeast to the West, we are talking about savings 
between 25% and 45%," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The airline said the fares require a seven-day advance purchase and a two-night 
stay. The tickets are refundable, may be changed without penalty and can be 
used from Jan. 9 through May 1, excluding holiday blackout dates. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan said the fare cuts apply to between 90% and 95% of Eastern's domestic 
flights. The remaining fares were cut last week in response to general industry 
reductions, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Under the promotion, Eastern will charge $69 each way for travel between any 
Florida city and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern said flights to Florida from most points in the East start at about $69 
each way. 
</P>
<P>
A flight from New York to Miami will cost $79 each way off-peak and $99 each 
way during peak travel, compared to the lowest industry fares of $149 off-peak 
and $169 on-peak, Eastern said. 
</P>
<P>
The new Eastern fares are based on a round-trip purchase. Off-peak prices are 
available for travel from noon Monday until noon Friday. Weekend fares are an 
additional $20 each way. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern said the new fares are not available for travel to Florida on Feb. 
14-18 and April 12, 13 and 22. They are not available for travel from Florida 
on Feb. 19, Feb. 24-26, April 12-13 and April 21-23. 
</P>
<P>
The fares to and from all other cities are not available April 12-13 and April 
22. 
</P>
<P>
The fare cuts were expected by industry analysts, who said Eastern was trying 
to boost traffic and improve its cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the company said it would eliminate about 600 jobs and temporarily 
cut wages and benefits for some employees in an effort to reduce costs. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, another Texas Air unit said it will raise domestic and 
international air fares by 4% because of soaring jet fuel prices. 
</P>
<P>
Continental Airlines said the fare increases will go into effect on all tickets 
purchased after Jan. 10 for domestic travel and on subsequent January dates on 
international tickets. 
</P>
<P>
The carrier said its fuel costs rose 43% to an average of 71 cents a gallon in 
the fourth quarter of 1989 from an average of 49.6 cents a gallon in the 1988 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Continental said it has seen fuel prices jump to $1.10 from 63.5 cents a gallon 
on the New York market during the past 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Other carriers, including UAL Corp. and Trans World Airlines Inc., said they 
are considering ways to defray rising fuel costs.

A ruptured Exxon pipeline spilled 5,000 to 10,000 gallons of home heating oil 
into the Arthur Kill separating New Jersey and Staten Island, forcing cleanup 
of more than a mile of the busy commercial waterway, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
Shipping was not impeded despite a safety zone set up in the Goethals Bridge 
area so that a local contractor could contain the worst concentration of the 
oil slick, the Coast Guard said. Exxon officials said the spill could be 
cleaned within two days. It had not yet been determined whether the oil caused 
environmental damage, officials said.

STUDY FINDS MEN ALSO LOSE BONE MASS

Men lose roughly 2% of their existing bone mass per year in the same type of 
loss that can severely affect women after menopause, a three-year study 
indicates. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a problem with osteoporosis in men that hasn't been appreciated," 
said Dr. Eric Orwoll, who led the study by the Oregon Health Sciences 
University at Portland. Men apparently suffer gradual bone loss throughout 
their lives, while women often suffer a marked increase in bone loss after they 
reach menopause, Orwoll said. Researchers believe bone loss in women is related 
to the decrease in estrogen levels associated with menopause.

The California Legislature, which reconvenes today, has such a poor public 
image that most voters think it is commonplace for lawmakers to take bribes, 
the Los Angeles Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
Voters believe overwhelmingly that most legislators "are for sale" to fat-cat 
campaign contributors, the survey showed. In fact, voters largely assume that 
all of state government -- the executive as well as legislative branches -- "is 
pretty much run by a few big interests." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, beginning his final year in office, is generating only 
lukewarm support from voters, who have a hard time naming anything that either 
he or the Legislature has accomplished recently. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the governor and the Legislature had their most productive year 
together in 1989, laboring hard to reach complex agreements on highway 
improvement, garbage disposal and compensation for injured workers. 
</P>
<P>
But continuing scandal, including a lingering FBI investigation into Capitol 
political corruption, and the current trial of a state senator on charges of 
extorting bribes and laundering money, has severely tarnished the image of a 
state Legislature that only a few years ago was considered a model for the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Deukmejian Administration, which has maintained a relatively clean 
image throughout most of the governor's two terms, recently has been brushed by 
the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The poll found that the electorate would support financing political campaigns 
with tax dollars and eliminating all private contributions. Voters also like 
the idea of limiting the length of time that legislators and statewide 
officials can remain in office. 
</P>
<P>
The Times poll, directed by I. A. Lewis, asked 2,046 California adults -- 
including 1,594 registered voters -- a series of questions concerning their 
opinions of the Legislature and state government. The margin of error for the 
telephone survey, conducted Dec. 2-6, is three percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
Although just one legislator -- state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) -- 
currently faces a formal charge of soliciting bribes, a majority of voters 
(53%) surveyed by The Times thought that "taking bribes is a relatively common 
practice" among lawmakers in Sacramento. This was especially true of Los 
Angeles County voters and Democrats statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Only 38% felt that bribe-taking was "rare." The most trusting were voters in 
the San Francisco Bay Area and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
By 2 to 1, voters agreed with the thesis that "most state legislators are for 
sale to their largest campaign contributors." 
</P>
<P>
And while many veteran politicos and academicians long for what they consider 
"the good old days" in Sacramento, two-thirds of the voters saw no difference 
between the current crop of legislators and their predecessors when it came to 
honesty. 
</P>
<P>
The ugly image extends beyond the chambers of the Legislature, the survey 
showed. By 2.5 to 1, voters agreed that "state government is pretty much run by 
a few big interests" rather than "for the benefit of all the people." Again, 
the most negative views came from Los Angeles County and from Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Almost half the voters figured that state government pretty much ignores the 
rank-and-file citizenry, paying "not very much or hardly any attention at all 
to what the people think when it decides what to do." 
</P>
<P>
And it was a wash, from the voters' view, between which branch of government is 
the most honest. Democrats thought the Democratic-controlled Legislature the 
most honest. Conversely, Republicans gave the GOP governor higher marks for 
honesty. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, voters estimated on the average that nearly a third of members of 
both the Legislature and executive branch "got there by using unethical or 
illegal methods." 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than half the voters surveyed -- 45% -- approved of "the way George 
Deukmejian is handling his job as governor." The rest were split about evenly 
between those who disapproved of his performance and people who felt they still 
did not know enough about the governor -- despite his seven years in office -- 
to have formed an opinion. 
</P>
<P>
This job performance rating for Deukmejian was roughly similar to one found two 
months earlier by a Times poll. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest survey, six in 10 Republican voters approved of Deukmejian, but 
only one-third of Democrats and independents did. The governor rated high among 
political conservatives, frequent church-goers, people with higher incomes, 
those over age 65 and rural voters. He ranked especially low among union 
members and liberals. 
</P>
<P>
Many voters were at a loss to cite state problems that either the governor or 
the Legislature had dealt with successfully. Four in 10 could not name a 
Deukmejian success and half could not cite a legislative accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
Among voters who offered opinions, Deukmejian's achievements were considered to 
be mostly in the fields of taxes, education and crime. No accomplishment really 
stood out for the Legislature. And both branches of government got low marks 
for "ethics," although the Legislature last year did spend several months 
developing a wide-ranging ballot proposal aimed at cleaning up its image and 
curbing its most flagrant abuses. 
</P>
<P>
Few voters -- fewer than 1 in 10 -- credited Deukmejian with "a great deal . . 
. of leadership and vision as California prepares for the 21st Century." But a 
solid majority said he had provided at least "some" leadership and vision. The 
Legislature, on the other hand, was not given credit for even "some" leadership 
and vision by most of those surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
As the Legislature convenes the second half of a two-year session, there is no 
question what voters regard as "the most important problem facing California 
today." It is crime and drugs, selected by 70% of those asked. No other issue 
came close on the voters' priority list. Blacks were particularly worried about 
this scourge. 
</P>
<P>
Allowed up to two answers each, people also cited education (26%), the 
environment (20%), automobile insurance (16%) and health care (13%) as 
important problems. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than one in 10 voters named transportation or government ethics, two 
issues the Legislature focused heavily on last year. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Legislature's "greatest problem," voters tended to think it was that 
"members are too tied to special interests through campaign contributions." 
</P>
<P>
Three-fourths of those surveyed -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- advocated 
banning every private campaign contribution and providing tax dollars to pay 
for legislative races. Two-thirds also said they would "be willing to have a 
dollar or two added" to their state income tax to finance all political 
campaigns in California and eliminate private donations. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, calling state government a "swamp," has 
proposed a political reform ballot initiative that would provide partial public 
financing of campaigns for the Legislature and statewide office. 
</P>
<P>
His sweeping measure also would impose California's first-ever limits on the 
number of consecutive years elected state officials could remain in office. For 
the state Senate or Assembly, the limit would be 12 years. For statewide 
office, such as governor, the limit would be eight years, or two terms. 
</P>
<P>
Legislative leaders have reacted angrily to Van de Kamp's proposal for term 
limits, accusing him of pandering to the voters. Indeed, the Times poll showed 
that voters do agree with the attorney general. Seven in 10 favored "a limit on 
how long state officials can stay in office." And six in 10 would not allow a 
politician to hold the same job for more than eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in this survey -- especially Republicans -- also tended to think that 
the once-a-decade reapportionment of legislative and congressional districts 
would be more fair if the task were taken away from the Democratic-controlled 
Legislature and given to a bipartisan commission. There are various ballot 
proposals afoot to restrict or completely eliminate the Legislature's role in 
reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
California's initiative system remains popular with voters, despite having 
produced a staggering number of ballot propositions in recent years. By 5 to 3, 
those surveyed said that ballot measures "act as a brake on government" rather 
than "taking over government." 
</P>
<P>
Voters tended to believe that the growth in ballot measures has occurred 
because "the people of California use propositions to force needed reforms." 
Fewer voters subscribed to the thesis that "powerful interests with a lot of 
money use propositions to get around state government." 
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the voters agreed that ballot measures are "complicated." But 
these voters also said that they are nearly as informed about the ballot 
measures as they are the candidates.

ALL MEMBERS OF POLITBURO IN ROMANIA PUT IN PRISON

<P>
The interim government said Tuesday that it has imprisoned about 60 of former 
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's closest associates, including all members of the 
Politburo, and will punish "all evildoers from the old regime." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Constanin Girbea said that judgment will also follow 
for "all members of the Ceausescu family" and that the Defense Ministry will 
announce further details of punishments. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were convicted of genocide and other "grave 
crimes" against Romania at a secret trial and executed Dec. 25. Whether or 
where they were buried has not been disclosed, but the official Yugoslav news 
agency Tanjug quoted Girbea as saying they were "probably buried on the spot." 
</P>
<P>
Girbea told a news conference that all members of the Communist Party Politburo 
are in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"I estimate there are about 60 . . . all close colleagues of Ceausescu," he 
said. "All evildoers from the old regime will be brought to justice." 
</P>
<P>
About 40 Ceausescu relatives are thought to have occupied ranking government 
posts before the popular revolt that ended Ceausescu's 24-year rule. 
</P>
<P>
The Ceausescus' youngest son, Nicu, and only daughter, Zoia, were captured in 
the early days of the violent two-week uprising that claimed thousands of 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, a member of the National Salvation Front and a 
principal architect of the revolution, Silviu Brucan, announced that his 
organization will probably field its own candidates for elections in April. 
</P>
<P>
The front originally had said it would not post candidates for the elections, 
and Brucan did not explain the change of policy in his televised speech late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior economist in the Communist Party, Andrei Vela, told 
reporters that the party was "de facto dissolved already" but had to make its 
liquidation official. 
</P>
<P>
Vela said he belongs to a group of about 60 Communists trying to rebuild a 
political force on the left from the ashes of the party, once numerically the 
strongest in Eastern Europe with 3.8 million members out of a population of 23 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"We failed to take action in time to stop the rise of dictatorship," he said. 
Ceausescu had been allowed to build up a massive apparatus of repression and in 
the end the party lost all power to the dictator. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not take a stand. There was some opposition but it had not the 
necessary unity. Ceausescu was an able manipulator." 
</P>
<P>
Vela, who worked in the central party apparatus, said the Communist Party of 
Romania could no longer be reconstructed. 
</P>
<P>
No date had been set for the congress his initiative group was seeking and he 
did not know how many would attend. Vela said it will have to take place soon, 
since free elections have been scheduled for April. 
</P>
<P>
But he said there was "great hesitation because the center of gravity of fear 
has shifted from the opposition" to the party that once ruled. "It is an 
interesting irony," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bucharest was calm Tuesday. There were no reports of sniper fire or clashes 
between the army and members of Ceausescu's hated Securitate police, which was 
officially disbanded Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of armed secret police agents are still believed to be at large. 
</P>
<P>
The number of people killed in the uprising that toppled Ceausescu is still 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the International Red Cross in Geneva, Juerg Bischof, said 
initial estimates that at one point reached 80,000 were "far too high." But the 
spokesman offered no total. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats in Bucharest estimate that 7,000 to 10,000 people have died 
across the country.

FBI VIDEOTAPE SHOWS MONTOYA ACCEPTING CHECK 
</P>

<P>
Sen. Joseph B. Montoya accepted a $3,000 check from an undercover FBI agent, 
stuck it in his shirt pocket and then joked that the amount was really $30,000, 
in a secret videotape shown in federal court Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At a breakfast meeting punctuated by nasty remarks about several of his 
colleagues, Montoya took the money from a man he thought was a carousing 
Southern businessman, but who later turned out to be FBI Agent George Murray. 
</P>
<P>
As Montoya's trial on political corruption charges entered its second month, 
federal informant John Shahabian, who set up the $3,000 payment for Montoya, 
testified that he also made arrangements to pay three other legislators for 
their votes. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran Senate staff member told a federal court jury that Assemblyman Pat 
Nolan (R-Glendale), Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier) and then-Sen. Paul 
Carpenter (D-Cypress) accepted payments ranging from $5,000 to $20,000 from 
undercover agents. Like Montoya, the lawmakers agreed to support legislation 
benefiting a dummy shrimp importing company set up by the FBI, Shahabian said. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan, Hill and Carpenter remain under investigation by federal agents but have 
not been charged with any crime. Montoya is on trial on 12 counts of extortion, 
racketeering, bribery and money-laundering stemming from a federal undercover 
sting operation that began four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Shahabian said he was caught in the federal sting operation in 1986 when he 
negotiated a payment of $20,000 in campaign contributions from a federal 
undercover agent. The money was supposed to go to several senators, Shahabian 
said, but Carpenter -- Shahabian's boss at the time -- decided that he would 
"take it all." 
</P>
<P>
Though there had been related testimony previously, the 1988 videotape played 
for the jury showed for the first time how Montoya accepted the $3,000 check 
for simply attending a breakfast with Shahabian and Murray. Montoya, a Whittier 
Democrat, later reported the payment as an "honorarium." 
</P>
<P>
Murray posed as Georgia businessman George Miller, a married man who had stayed 
up late the night before drinking champagne with a "lady." 
</P>
<P>
The scene with Montoya was captured on videotape by a female agent sitting at 
the next table with a camera concealed in her purse. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the breakfast at a restaurant near the Capitol, the 50-year-old 
legislator ate fruit and yogurt with granola and made small talk about 
earthquakes, the upcoming Democratic presidential convention and his frequent 
trips to Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
At one point in the conversation Montoya described Sen. Rose Ann Vuich 
(D-Dinuba) as a "royal pain in the ass," saying she frequently slowed meetings 
of the committee she chairs, the Senate Banking and Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Montoya briefly discussed the difficulty of getting legislation for the 
shrimp company out of Vuich's committee several days earlier because of the 
hostile questions she began asking. 
</P>
<P>
Envelope Handed Over 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the breakfast, Murray pulled an envelope out of his briefcase 
and handed it to Montoya, who put it into his shirt pocket without looking 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in an apparent effort to get Montoya to acknowledge the payment on the 
tape, Murray joked that he might have written the check for just $3, because he 
had been drinking the night before. 
</P>
<P>
The senator took the check out of his pocket and joked, "No, it's 30,000, which 
is all right." 
</P>
<P>
A moment later, Montoya promised to be on the Senate floor the next day when 
the shrimp company legislation was scheduled for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be there," the senator said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even more revealing than the videotape was Shahabian's testimony about 
the three elected officials who are under investigation but have not been 
charged as a result of the federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination by defense attorney Michael Sands, Shahabian said that 
after he began cooperating with federal agents, he arranged for $15,000 in 
payments to various legislators who agreed to support the shrimp company 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
That included $7,500 in campaign contributions to Nolan, who was then the 
Assembly Republican leader, Shahabian told the jury. He also said he arranged 
for a $5,000 honorarium to Hill at a meeting similar to the breakfast meeting 
with Montoya. In a boost to the bill, Hill had agreed to become a co-author of 
the measure, Shahabian said. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate aide was first trapped in the sting himself when he was working for 
Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
Shahabian told the jury that he was contacted by an old acquaintance, Marv 
Levin, who was working for a real estate developer near the Capitol. Levin 
introduced Shahabian to a man going by the name of Jack Gordon, who said he was 
attempting to get the state's help in setting up a shrimp-processing plant in 
the Sacramento area. Gordon, it later turned out, was an undercover FBI agent 
who preceded Murray in the sting. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting Shahabian, Gordon asked for help in winning passage of 
legislation and asked how much it would cost. Shahabian told him it would take 
$20,000 -- a figure he testified Tuesday that "he just picked out of the air." 
</P>
<P>
Shahabian said he suggested that $5,000 go to Carpenter, another $5,000 go to 
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), $5,000 more to the 
Senate Democratic Caucus chaired by Sen. Milton Marks (D-San Francisco) and 
another $5,000 be held in reserve for state Treasurer Jesse M. Unruh, whose 
office had indicated that it would oppose the shrimp company bill. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Shahabian took the proposal to Carpenter, who was running a 
successful campaign that year for the State Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, he (Carpenter) decided he would take it all," Shahabian said. 
</P>
<P>
In order to help the bill win passage, Shahabian testified, Carpenter agreed to 
work behind the scenes to get the bill out of a committee where it appeared to 
be blocked. Shahabian said he gave two checks totaling $15,000 to Carpenter. He 
also testified that Carpenter later took another $5,000 directly from Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
Governor Tipped Off 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Shahabian received $7,500 from Carpenter for working on his 
campaign. The shrimp bill passed the Legislature in 1986 and was vetoed by Gov. 
George Deukmejian, who had been tipped off by FBI agents. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Shahabian got a call from Levin, who invited him to a meeting 
regarding the shrimp company's plans. When the Senate staffer walked in, he saw 
enlarged pictures of himself and heard tape recordings of his conversations 
with undercover agents. 
</P>
<P>
Frightened by the prospect of going to prison, Shahabian agreed to cooperate 
with federal agents in exchange for immunity from federal prosecution. He 
assumed his new duties the next day when, armed with a hidden tape recorder, he 
met with Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) to get his advice on how to win passage 
of a second bill in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Shahabian testified that Robbins told him it would take $40,000 in 
contributions to members of the Senate to win passage of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Shahabian said, Robbins agreed to sponsor the bill in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he wouldn't charge as much as Carpenter," Shahabian recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, however, Robbins turned down offers of money from Shahabian saying, 
"I don't need to be taken care of on every bill that comes through."

TESTS PROVE REINFORCING COULD HAVE SAVED NIMITZ 
</P>

<P>
Engineering tests on a still-standing segment of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland 
have confirmed that a relatively simple strengthening of a mile-long elevated 
section could have prevented its collapse in the Oct. 17 Bay Area earthquake, 
Caltrans officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The technique, which involves attaching steel reinforcement to the 
double-decked structure's concrete columns, was never applied to the Nimitz 
because engineers considered the structure to be one of the safest in the state 
until the 7.1-magnitude earthquake turned it into a stack of concrete pancakes, 
killing 42 people. 
</P>
<P>
But now California Department of Transportation engineers are preparing plans 
to use the retrofit technique on five Bay Area freeway segments similar to the 
Nimitz which remain closed because of fears that they, too, might collapse in a 
major quake. Information gleaned from the testing also may be applied to other 
freeways throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
"We now have physical proof that the retrofitting concept works," James 
Roberts, chief of Caltrans' structures division, said in a statement released 
by the department. "We can move forward confidently to apply this seismic 
strengthening to the other structures." 
</P>
<P>
The test results and recent comments by Caltrans officials appear to undercut 
what the department said in the immediate aftermath of the disaster: that the 
Nimitz Freeway columns were never strengthened because the theoretical 
technology to do so did not exist. In October, Caltrans officials said 
repeatedly that any such retrofitting was expected to take years to evolve out 
of research under way at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
That claim was disputed by engineers in the private sector and at universities, 
who said the technology existed to strengthen the Nimitz but the state had 
never thought of applying it. And now, after the quake emboldened Caltrans 
engineers and prompted state officials to provide more funds for research, UC 
Berkeley professors have applied existing technology developed by Caltrans to 
confirm that the structure could have been saved. 
</P>
<P>
Three different retrofit schemes were designed to strengthen the joints 
connecting the upper and lower portions of the concrete columns. Engineers 
agreed that the joints were the weak link that caused the columns to break 
apart and fall, leaving no support for the massive upper deck, which fell upon 
the lower lanes. 
</P>
<P>
In the testing, engineers attached steel bars, plates and beams to the columns 
and then subjected the structure to the kind of vibrations and movement that 
could be expected in a major quake. They used hydraulic jacks to apply more 
than 4 million pounds of lateral force to the structure, moving it more than 10 
inches. The force applied in the test was greater than that caused by the 
earthquake, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
"The structure did suffer some cracking, but did not collapse under the extreme 
forces," Roberts said in the prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Development of this kind of retrofit was not planned before the Bay Area 
earthquake, when Caltrans was focusing its effort on elevated structures 
supported by a single line of columns. But even if the research had been 
envisioned, Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago said, it would have taken much longer 
to complete without the availability of an existing structure to use for the 
testing. Without a chunk of the Nimitz to act as a guinea pig, engineers would 
have had to test their theories on a model. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said plans for retrofitting the closed Bay Area freeways should be 
finished by the end of the month, when they will know how much it will cost. 
The work is expected to be done this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials said the Nimitz Freeway testing was the biggest experiment 
of its kind ever conducted. In addition to confirming the retrofit technique, 
UC engineers were able to collect information that they will use to develop 
advanced mathematical models for further theoretical studies on elevated 
structures statewide. 
</P>
<P>
"The knowledge we have gained from these tests may be applied to other bridges 
across the state built before 1971," Roberts said. Structures built after 1971 
have more advanced designs developed after a major earthquake in the San 
Fernando Valley.

2 RAILROADS IN LINE FOR $52-MILLION TAX REBATE; 
</P>
<P>
UTILITIES: LEGAL SETTLEMENT WOULD GIVE THEM REFUNDS FROM 51 COUNTIES IN THE

With Los Angeles County facing the largest payment, counties across the state 
are being asked to refund the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroads $52.5 
million in back property taxes since 1978, the State Board of Equalization 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed settlement, filed in a San Francisco federal court last week, 
would end a lengthy legal dispute in which California's two major railroads 
have maintained that they were unfairly taxed under Proposition 13, which froze 
tax values for homes but not utilities such as the railroads. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the settlement, Los Angeles County and 50 other counties 
would give the railroads $52.5 million in cash or future property tax breaks in 
exchange for the companies dropping a number of lawsuits in state and federal 
court. The Los Angeles County share would be $14 million, the largest of any 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
Bitter Legal Fight 
</P>
<P>
"We're buying piece of mind here for a very, very, very small sum," Robert 
Tyler, a supervising deputy attorney general, said of the proposed settlement. 
"If the railroads won (the court cases), the counties and ultimately the state 
stand to lose a lot of money. I'm talking two and three times this amount." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed settlement must be ratified by Feb. 9 by a majority of the 
counties or it will be withdrawn, Tyler said. 
</P>
<P>
Ratification would end a bitter legal fight begun almost immediately after 
enactment of Proposition 13, the 1978 tax revolt measure aimed at keeping 
property taxes low in reaction to monumental surges in property values. While 
the measure froze tax values at 1975 levels for homeowners and many 
businessmen, the state Supreme Court held in 1978 that the same protection did 
not extend to utilities like the railroads. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with that opinion, the state's Board of Equalization, which is 
responsible for setting the valuations on utilities, continued to assess 
railroad property at its full market value, bumping it up each year for 
inflation. The result: railroad property tax bills increased annually at a 
faster rate than did those for other commercial concerns, such as shopping 
centers and office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the widening disparity, railroads -- including the Southern Pacific 
Transportation Company and the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Company 
-- filed a series of suits against the state and county tax collectors. The 
railroads argued that the state's tax scheme under Proposition 13 violated a 
1976 federal law that makes it illegal to tax railroads at a higher level than 
other commercial property. 
</P>
<P>
The railroads won an early legal battle in 1982, when a federal court found 
that most commercial property was on the tax rolls at about 63% of its market 
value while the railroads were forced to pay 100%. That continuing disparity 
means that counties across California owe the railroads almost $300 million in 
back taxes, said Phoenix attorney Paul J. Mooney, who represents both Santa Fe 
and Southern Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, the sheer cost of the court dispute prompted both sides to 
sit down and discuss a deal, Mooney said. 
</P>
<P>
The two railroads own about 80% of all railroad land in California. Companies 
owning the other 20% still have similar lawsuits pending against the state and 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
"The litigation had frankly gotten out of hand," Mooney said. "We're dealing 
with a case in which the parties had expended, collectively, $15 million in 
litigation fees and expert testimony." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Bennett, an assistant county counsel for Los Angeles County, declined 
Tuesday to discuss the proposed settlement in detail. But he said the 
announcement by the Board of Equalization was "premature" and could jeopardize 
the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that, while the $14-million share from Los Angeles County would be 
a "burden," the county could find the money in its $9.6-billion budget. "In a 
budget of our size, this amount of money can be found," he said.

FEDERAL INDIAN AGENCY OFFICES IN RIVERSIDE DAMAGED BY BOMB BLAST

<P>
A bomb exploded just before dawn at the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs offices 
here Tuesday, causing extensive property damage but no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
No one had claimed responsibility for the bombing by Tuesday evening, and 
Bureau of Indian Affairs officials said no threats or warnings of any kind had 
been received in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all a big mystery to us at this point," said Steve Gleason, an aide to 
Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs Eddie Brown in Washington. "Everyone is 
just perplexed." 
</P>
<P>
An FBI spokesman in Los Angeles confirmed that an investigation is under way by 
that agency. The spokesman, Jim Neilson, added that investigators will examine 
whether Tuesday's bombing is linked to the explosion of a pipe bomb last week 
on the Morongo Indian Reservation near Banning. 
</P>
<P>
Damage from the Morongo bombing, which occurred at 2 a.m. Friday outside the 
reservation's administrative center, totaled about $4,000 and consisted mostly 
of broken windows and punctured walls. 
</P>
<P>
"At this time, we don't believe the two events are related," said Riverside 
County Sheriff's Capt. Jake Bowser, who is leading the Morongo investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Bowser said so far there are no suspects or known motives in the reservation 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's explosion at the Bureau of Indian Affairs offices occurred at about 
5:20 a.m., a time when none of the agency's 40 employees was at work. The blast 
was not discovered until about two hours later, when an employee arrived to 
find the receptionist area and an adjacent office in the agency's second-story 
suite nearly destroyed, Riverside police spokesman Pete Esquivel said. 
</P>
<P>
Esquivel said police received numerous calls at 5:20 a.m. from residents who 
reported hearing a loud boom. 
</P>
<P>
All businesses in the two-story building, located next to the Riverside Freeway 
at 3600 Lime St., were closed for the day as bomb experts with the Riverside 
Police Department began the tedious job of sifting through broken glass and 
other debris. No monetary estimate of the damage was provided. 
</P>
<P>
Though the explosion caused no fire, walls were blown out, windows were 
shattered and the floor had gaping holes, agency officials said. A business on 
the building's ground floor also sustained moderate damage. 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to specify the type or strength of device used in the attack. 
But Bureau of Indian Affairs officials said they were told that the explosion 
was caused by a pipe bomb placed outside the front door of the suite, where the 
agency's Southern California field office, which serves 23 tribes, has been 
located for five years. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Jaeger, the agency's area director for California, said employees were 
placed on administrative leave until their quarters can be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
Jaeger said he saw no connection between Tuesday's incident and a recent spate 
of mail and package bombings aimed at judges, courts, attorneys and civil 
rights organizations in the South. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't see a link," Jaeger said.

FDA TESTING MILK IN L.A., 12 OTHER CITIES FOR ANIMAL DRUG RESIDUES

The Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday that it has begun testing 
retail milk supplies in 13 cities, including Los Angeles, after an independent 
survey found samples in several areas tainted with potentially harmful drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA said that while it "is concerned that these unconfirmed findings may 
indicate violative drug residues in milk," it sees "no public health threat 
associated with animal drug residues in milk at the levels reported by the Wall 
Street Journal." 
</P>
<P>
The Journal's survey, reported Friday, found that of 50 retail samples 
collected in 10 major cities, 38% were contaminated with antibiotics and sulfa 
drugs used to treat sick cattle. The newspaper said the most troubling in that 
class of drugs is sulfamethazine, a suspected carcinogen. 
</P>
<P>
Another survey by the Center for Science in the Public Interest tested 20 milk 
samples from store shelves in metropolitan Washington and found 20% were 
tainted. 
</P>
<P>
FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit noted that the test both surveys used, called Charm 
II, can detect the presence of the class of drugs known as sulfonamides, but 
that further testing is required to identify which sulfa drug is present. 
</P>
<P>
Nesbit said the FDA will release the results of its latest tests when they are 
completed, probably within two to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The other cities where milk is being tested are Boston, New York, Philadelphia, 
Atlanta, Miami, Chicago, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Kansas City, Denver, Dallas, San 
Francisco and Seattle.

DYMALLY DEFENDS HIS ROLE IN ANGOLAN OIL CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally's (D-Compton) office brushed off a published report 
Tuesday that he had interceded with the president of Marxist Angola to help a 
wealthy Los Angeles supporter nail down a $12-million contract for the sale and 
shipment of Angolan crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally, who has boasted of past attempts to help black-owned U.S. firms get 
business from African and Caribbean governments, was traveling in the Middle 
East and could not be reached for comment on his efforts to assist Richard G. 
Griffey, head of Solar Records in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Griffey and his wife gave $1,750 to Dymally's most recent election campaign. 
Griffey also is reported to be the chief benefactor of the Coalition for a Free 
Africa, which has paid part of Dymally's travel expenses on recent trips to 
Nigeria, Brazil and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
An article in the Washington Post said that Dymally, a five-term House member 
known as the staunchest congressional advocate of Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's 
strongman-president, was accompanied to Angola by Griffey in October, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
While Dymally later reported to Congress that he had discussed "peace efforts" 
in Angola and Namibia with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, Griffey 
also met the Angolan leader on that visit. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, the article said, Griffey's firm -- African Development Public 
Interest Corp. -- received the $12-million shipment of Angolan oil that had 
been promised nearly two years before. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Griffey was invited by Dymally to join in a June, 1987, meeting in 
Washington between the congressman and Angola's minister of petroleum and 
industry, Pedro Van-Dunem. 
</P>
<P>
While the minister wanted to enlist Dymally's help in blocking efforts in 
Congress to impose an embargo against Angola, Griffey complained to him of 
delays in the shipment of oil that Angola had agreed to sell to his firm. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally supported Griffey's position, the Post reported, but the story quoted 
the Los Angeles business executive as saying that Dymally did not demand a quid 
pro quo for opposing the proposed embargo. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his office, Dymally did not challenge the account but 
said that the reporter who wrote the article "spent four months trying to prove 
that I tried to help African-American businessmen, minorities and women gain a 
foothold in Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Dymally said that as far as he knows, "The Department of State is pleased with 
my work in Africa, and more than 30 million African Americans will benefit when 
we are able to do business with Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Griffey, who has been trying to do business with African countries for nearly a 
decade, founded the Coalition for a Free Africa in 1986. Dymally is on its 
board of advisers. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally has acknowledged that he wrote a letter to the president of Uganda in 
1988 to try to get another friend and political supporter a contract for 
handling U.S. food shipments to Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
He defended his strongly worded letter on behalf of Mamadi Diane, however, as 
proper for a black member of Congress in advocating the interests of a 
black-owned American firm. Diane, a native of Guinea who is head of the 
Zaire-American Research Institute, has accompanied Dymally on trips to Zaire 
and acted as his interpreter there. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally has reported that the government of Zaire has paid for his airline 
tickets and hotel expenses within Africa and even a three-day stay on the 
French Riviera for a visit with the vacationing Mobutu. 
</P>
<P>
A recent report by Dymally's campaign fund shows that he picked up a $629 
dinner tab at an expensive Chinese restaurant in Washington to entertain a 
visiting delegation from Angola last April.

The United States sent about 160 women soldiers into Panama with the invasion 
forces -- the most extensive use of armed women in any U.S. conflict, the Army 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Army policy does not permit women to seek out and engage the enemy in combat, 
but women soldiers who come under fire are allowed to defend themselves and 
return gunfire. And they did in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
"Women have always been involved in our conflicts," Army spokeswoman Paige 
Eversole said. "This is the operation where women have played their biggest 
role." 
</P>
<P>
She said there were no casualties among the women soldiers sent into Panama as 
part of the 12,000-strong invasion force Dec. 20 or among the women already 
stationed in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Many of "these women were serving with the MPs (military police) . . . and were 
highly visible. . . . They were receiving fire and returning fire. But they 
were not seeking out and engaging the enemy," Eversole said. 
</P>
<P>
Army Sgt. Melissa Jackson, 22, of El Paso, Texas, assigned to Panama as a 
supply sergeant in October, was one of those caught in the fighting. She 
returned to the United States on Tuesday with other U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're in a situation like that, there's no way they can get you out of 
there," Jackson told reporters in San Antonio. "You can't avoid it. So if 
you're there, you're there. It was scary." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 160 women deployed on the Panama operation, 47 were members of the 16th 
Military Police Brigade from Fort Bragg, N.C., and 43 came from the 7th 
Infantry Division, Ft. Ord, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, 34 women were deployed with the Corps Support Command, 28 were 
from the 525th Military Intelligence Brigade, 14 were from the 35th Signal 
Brigade, four were from Special Operations Command and two each were from the 
18th Airborne Headquarters and the 18th Finance Corps. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no conscious decision to send women; there was no conscious decision 
not to send women," Eversole said, adding that these women were members of 
military units ordered to Panama. "No one got in their way." 
</P>
<P>
The four women from Special Operations sent to Panama were not members either 
of the elite Navy SEALs nor the Delta Force, because these are defined as 
combat groups, Eversole said. Women must have played a support role, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Eight U.S. military women died during the Vietnam War but only one was killed 
from "hostile fire," Eversole said. Some military women were in Grenada after 
the U.S. invasion in 1983, "but they weren't involved to the degree" of those 
sent to Panama, Eversole said.

The Bush Administration, pledging help to restore Panama's ravaged economy, 
turned over to the U.S.-backed regime of President Guillermo Endara $70 million 
in government funds that had been frozen during the dictatorship of Manuel A. 
Noriega, the State Department announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the Administration soon will take 
additional steps, including restoration of another $300 million in blocked 
assets, to repair the damage to the economy caused by the two-week-old American 
invasion and more than two years of U.S. economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
"We are making the frozen Panamanian assets available to the new government of 
Panama in an orderly manner," Boucher said. "Some $70 million in blocked funds 
was transferred back to the Endara government over the weekend." 
</P>
<P>
He said the government is working to restore Panama's access to programs of the 
U.S. Agriculture Department, the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private 
Investment Corp. He added that the United States will resume buying sugar from 
Panama and restore Panama's status as a favored trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said a delegation headed by Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. 
Eagleburger and Deputy Treasury Secretary John Robson will meet today with 
Endara and other top Panamanian officials to determine that nation's economic 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
He said the delegation will determine the level and the nature of a new U.S. 
aid program intended "to restore democratic institutions and processes and to 
promote sustained private-sector-led growth," Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
Although other officials said that Eagleburger has been deeply involved in 
negotiations to bring Noriega to the United States for trial on 
drug-trafficking charges, Boucher said the focus of the delegation will be on 
economic matters. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of their visit is to learn firsthand from the Panamanian 
leadership about their plans for economic recovery and to make recommendations 
to President Bush on ways in which the United States can be of assistance to 
Panamanian recovery efforts," Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Eagleburger and Robson will return to Washington late today but that 
other members of their delegation will remain in Panama for at least a week to 
continue to study the nation's economic requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Endara, apparent winner of last year's Panamanian election before it was 
nullified by Noriega, was installed as chief of state after the U.S. invasion. 
Although the Panamanian election commission certified Endara's victory last 
week, only about 10 nations have joined the United States in recognizing his 
government.

A small contingent of the 14,000 U.S. troops who invaded Panama returned home 
to California on Tuesday, saying they had accomplished their mission of helping 
to install a democratic government. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six Army soldiers of the 7th Light Infantry Division based at Ft. Ord, 
the first uninjured troops to leave Panama since the U.S. invasion on Dec. 20, 
landed aboard a C-141 transport at 6:45 a.m. after a brief stop at Kelly Air 
Force Base in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers, among 141 that left Panama on Monday, said they were well 
received in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
"Now they have a democratic government -- it's what they want. They love 
Americans," said Sgt. John Grauer, 29, of Fresno. "They love what we did." 
</P>
<P>
Spec. 4 Ralph Santos, a 19-year-old from Los Angeles, said the reaction of 
Panamanians boosted the spirits of the troops. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the morale of the soldiers was greatly increased. The infantry guys 
were treated like heroes by the Panamanians," said Santos, who speaks Spanish 
and was called on at times to interpret for military police. 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways I was expecting more of a negative reaction," he said." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the returning soldiers were from field artillery and air defense 
batteries that provided protection for infantrymen in Panama City, at a 
Panamanian army base at Rio Hato on the Pacific coast and in the city of David 
on the Costa Rican border. 
</P>
<P>
"Their military mission is finished," said Pentagon spokesman Maj. David Super. 
"It's just a continued tailoring of the military force in Panama as the need 
for combat troops is diminished. The growing mission down there now is for 
nation-building and civil affairs." 
</P>
<P>
Because they are artillery defense units, many of the troops carried M-60 
machine guns as well as the standard M-16 automatic rifles. 
</P>
<P>
Second Lt. John Jaskwhich said the artillery units were called in to assist 
infantry troops but did not have to fire any weapons other than flares to light 
up the sky for attacking troops. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the artillerymen, however, flew into the Rio Hato area while fighting 
was still intense, and the sound of gunfire made them nervous, the soldiers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The flight crew told us it was pretty hot. The plane was getting shot at when 
we were coming in," said Jaskwhich. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just glad to be back to celebrate a little Christmas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As the C-141 flew into Monterey, soldiers breakfasted on bologna and cheese 
sandwiches, chips and sodas. Some played cards, while others touched up their 
camouflage makeup. 
</P>
<P>
The hulking, gray-and-green four-engine jet landed at the Monterey airport 
about three hours after it had lifted off from the Texas base. The plane was 
taxied to the tarmac opposite the terminal, several hundred yards from a small 
group of civilians who had gathered to watch. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers, still in full battle dress, left the plane and boarded buses for 
the short drive to Ft. Ord. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Davis, a spokesman at Ft. Ord, described the mood there as "very up, very 
up."

ROMANIA: LONGTIME FOES OF COMMUNISM GET TOGETHER TO PUSH FOR NATIONAL UNITY.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The old men had been waiting 40 years for vindication, and they met Tuesday for 
the first time with an excitement that seemed to wipe away all the ills of old 
age, all the rheumatism and high blood pressure and heart problems, in a moment 
of triumph they could barely contain. 
</P>
<P>
The Communists had been routed from Romania. Or at least the Communist, Nicolae 
Ceausescu, had been routed, along with his top henchmen. 
</P>
<P>
"We fought them from the first," said schoolteacher Ion Radu, who at 59 was 
among the youngest of the 60 men who gathered in a cold and empty house in the 
center of Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, they met as a section of the soon-to-be registered National 
Peasants Party. But their real purpose was to establish themselves as an 
organization of former political prisoners -- the first avowed enemies of 
communism in Romania, and the first to suffer because of it. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the men were in their 60s and 70s and had fought with Romanian 
anti-Communist resistance and Partisan movements at the end of World War II. 
They have vivid memories of encampments in the Carpathian Mountains, of 
guerrilla warfare with the Communists who took over at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Others were rounded up in the Stalinist terror that swept the newly Communist 
nations of Eastern Europe after the war. Their prison terms ranged from five to 
15 years, in the period of about 1946 to 1964, when most were released. 
</P>
<P>
They returned to a Romania where communism was deeply entrenched, and they went 
on with their lives, in bitter silence. But they did not forget their fight as 
Romanian society, under the Ceausescu regime, grew steadily more oppressed. 
</P>
<P>
And the mood Tuesday, as the old fighters met, bordered on euphoria, as they 
quarreled energetically over such things as how best to proceed with the 
election of officers, to press their case and, once again, to simply announce 
their existence. 
</P>
<P>
"We suffer from two diseases right now," Radu said. "First, we haven't talked 
in so long that we cannot stop. And second, the longer a man talks, the more 
convinced he is that he is right. You must have patience with us." 
</P>
<P>
Strikingly, these old opponents of communism have found allies in the youngest 
opponents of communism, the youth who probably paid most dearly in the 
revolution that toppled the Ceausescu regime. Both sides see in the other a 
similar combative dedication to the anti-Communist cause. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the war, the Peasants Party won 80% of the vote," said Ion 
Radoi, a 25-year-old youth leader. "But the Communists falsified the election 
results, and many people were imprisoned after this. The common point is that 
they suffered -- and so did we." 
</P>
<P>
The links between the old and the young have parallels in Poland and Hungary, 
where the youth find a closer kinship in political thinking with their 
grandfathers than with their parents. 
</P>
<P>
In Poland, the cult surrounding the memory of Gen. Jozef Pilsudski, who led an 
independent Poland during the years between the world wars -- and was the only 
Polish general to defeat the Soviets in battle -- has equal adherents among the 
young and the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
In Romania, anti-Communists were sent to work in labor camps on the Danube 
River-Black Sea canal project; thousands of them are believed to have died. The 
heads of both the Liberal and Peasants parties were convicted in show trials in 
1947 and died in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most venerable members of the gathering in Bucharest on Tuesday was 
Gregore Brancusi, 79, who said he is a nephew of the Romanian sculptor, 
Constantin Brancusi, and who is famous as the leader of a resistance brigade 
that fought the Communists until 1951. He spent 13 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not interested in revenge," Brancusi said. "We are interested in 
national unity." 
</P>
<P>
In careful handwriting in a small notebook, Brancusi has catalogued the 
veterans' demands, which are to be presented to the new government. They go 
back to the beginning: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The 1946 elections should be declared illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A list of political prisoners who died in prison and labor camps should be 
published. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Proper military decorations should be issued to army members who refused to 
join Communist forces. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The names of political, scientific and cultural figures who died in prison 
should be made public. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Statistics on the number of people passing through prisons and labor camps 
should be published. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Heads of prisons and work colonies should be brought to justice. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Personnel from prisons and work camps who tortured prisoners should be 
named. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lawyers who were appointed to defend political prisoners and who failed to 
present an adequate defense should be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Priests who informed on opposition activists should be expelled from the 
Orthodox Church and their names should be published. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Property taken from political prisoners and their families should be 
restored. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pensions for secret police officers and top police officials should be 
reviewed and possibly revoked. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Romanians in exile should be invited back to contribute to the "moral 
purification" of the country. 
</P>
<P>
It is not likely, given the pressing demands of making a new government work 
and, eventually, of administering elections and reordering a Communist economy, 
that these demands will be a matter of high priority for the new government. 
</P>
<P>
But for most of those gathered Tuesday, this program does not matter. It is 
enough, as one of them said, to say that "we are still here." 
</P>
<P>
"In 1948, they pulled out my fingernails," Alexandru Stoicescu said. "I was a 
lawyer, and when I came out of prison, I made paper bags to sell on the street. 
I lost my wife. I lost my child. But I am here. Today, I am here."

<P>
Czechoslovakia's new President Vaclav Havel, on a quick trip to the two 
Germanys, declared Tuesday that Europe need have no fear of a reunited Germany 
-- so long as it is democratic. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, who assumed the presidency last Friday, met with East German leaders in 
East Berlin and told reporters afterward that Germany "can be as large as it 
wants." 
</P>
<P>
He also made a surprise visit to the Berlin Wall, at the Brandenburg Gate, and 
said he was "amazed that the wall was still standing." According to Havel, the 
acting East German head of state, Manfred Gerlach, said that the wall soon will 
be coming down. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him that if he had any problems we could send some independent 
Czechoslovak workers to help -- free of charge," Havel added. 
</P>
<P>
Gerlach also told the West German newspaper Bild that the wall will soon come 
down. "We are dismantling it," the newspaper quoted Gerlach as saying. "It has 
become superfluous. It will be replaced by ordinary border markers." 
</P>
<P>
Bild said Gerlach had not set a date for tearing down the wall, but had 
indicated that the matter will be taken up soon by his government. 
</P>
<P>
Havel said that the two Germanys should not decide on their future until after 
the euphoria brought on by their recently acquired freedom dies down, and he 
added that they should decide in consultation with the rest of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Democratic awareness and a democratic system," he said, "are more important 
than the possibility that it might become one nation of 60 or 80 million 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Havel, accompanied by Prime Minister Marian Calfa and Foreign Minister Jiri 
Deinstbier, spent four hours in East Berlin, talking with Prime Minister Hans 
Modrow and other officials, before flying to Munich and a meeting with West 
German President Richard von Weizsaecker and Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl said he looks for good relations between Bonn and Prague and went on to 
say, "When I look at the weather here in Munich today -- bright sunshine -- it 
is a good omen for the 1990s that are now beginning." 
</P>
<P>
He said there would be no concrete agreements in his meeting with Havel and 
that "the most important thing today is getting to know one another." 
</P>
<P>
Havel, a popular hero of the November uprising that brought down 
Czechoslovakia's Communist leadership, said he expects East Germany and West 
Germany to agree on their future and that "it must be part of a whole European 
process." 
</P>
<P>
"It must be worked out by negotiations, not through wild gestures," he said. 
"Much of Czechoslovakia borders on East or West Germany; Germany virtually 
surrounds us. It must free its neighbors of fear, specifically the fear of a 
greater Germany."

CHINA MAY LET FANG LIZHI LEAVE FOR AUSTRALIA SOON

China will allow dissident Fang Lizhi to leave the U.S. Embassy in Beijing 
where he has been since June and travel to Australia before the end of this 
month, a Hong Kong magazine said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Both the American and Australian consulates in Hong Kong declined to comment on 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine Pai Shing, without revealing its sources, said a preliminary 
understanding was reached during a visit to Beijing in December by U.S. 
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. It was later approved by senior 
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. 
</P>
<P>
Fang, a scientist and one of China's leading dissidents, sought asylum with his 
wife in the U.S. Embassy shortly after troops crushed pro-democracy protests in 
Beijing on June 4. 
</P>
<P>
Their presence in the embassy is hindering improvement in relations between the 
United States and China. 
</P>
<P>
Pai Shing, usually well-informed on Chinese affairs, said Fang is likely to 
leave Beijing after Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke's visit to China in 
mid-January and before the lunar new year Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, China's ambassador to the United States did not deny the report 
of an impending deal on Fang. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say anything about that," Zhu Qichen told reporters after meeting 
Undersecretary of State Robert Kimmit at the State Department. Asked 
specifically if he would deny that a deal on Fang was in the works, Zhu 
repeated the same reply. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department also refused to discuss the subject.

Four people have died of carbon monoxide poisoning in a motor home outside a

</P>
<P>
Sheriff's investigators said the victims died New Year's Day while camping in 
Mt. Laguna in the Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's office identified them as Katherine Walsh, 30; Michael McCrae, 
32; Conan Lemmer, 28, and Graham Rayner, 28, all of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The four were on a vacation in McCrae's motor home and were using a generator 
to power a heater in the 30-degree weather, but the exhaust pipe was too short 
to allow proper ventilation, deputies said.

Teachers here ended Christmas vacation Tuesday by manning picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
The Stockton Unified School District's latest offer was rejected by 89% of the 
Stockton Teachers Assn. members during a special meeting on New Year's night, 
said Milly Bettinger of the California Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,410-teacher district was hiring substitutes to replace striking teachers, 
spokesman John Klose said. The exact numbers of strikers and substitutes hired 
was unavailable, but Klose estimated that there was one teacher for every 100 
students in the 31,700-student district. Normally, the ratio is one to 30. 
</P>
<P>
The district has offered raises of 4.5% this year and 5% next fall on a salary 
range that starts at $22,700 annually and goes to $39,560 for the most 
experienced, best educated teachers. The teachers are seeking raises of 8% now 
and 9% next year, Bettinger said.

RILEY SAYS LAKERS NOT MAKING THE GRADE

<P>
You probably thought the Lakers were playing well this season. Their 21-6 
record indicates as much. Opponents have offered unsolicited praise. Most in 
the media have lauded their effort. 
</P>
<P>
But is Coach Pat Riley satisfied? Not according to a statistical evaluation he 
and his staff gave to Laker players before their final practice of 1989 on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said that starters and reserves alike are not producing strong enough 
individual statistics in the usual areas -- field goal percentage, rebounding, 
turnovers, steals and assists -- compared to previous seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"They are all down," Riley said. "Overall, from a number standpoint, our top 
four guys (Magic Johnson, James Worthy, Byron Scott and A.C. Green) are all 
down at least 12 to 18% from last year in some areas and are down a hell of a 
lot more from their best years. 
</P>
<P>
"Every one of our players is down in certain areas we think are important. 
We've tried to establish some guidelines for them to shoot for, but it's up to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"Individuals have to want to keep striving. If they're just content with 
winning, then they may not have individual success. The team will carry them. 
But if they can get into increasing their performance, it'll help the team that 
much more." 
</P>
<P>
Added Riley: "The individual player has to be most responsible for his 
individual play across the board. Getting 22 points and 10 rebounds a game -- 
that means nothing to me. They've got to try to develop some consistency in 
their total game. They need to know these things. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can just improve 1% (individually) in a number of these areas . . . 
That 1% could be five-tenths of a rebound or one-tenth of a steal (per game). 
You multiply that 1% by 12 (players), you'll get a significant improvement in 
team performance." 
</P>
<P>
Laker players have come to expect such scrutiny of their performances from 
Riley. His New Year's Day report card -- they reportedly used to include letter 
grades, but no longer -- has been a standard for the past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
This time, they expected a poor report, since the team field goal percentage 
and points per game have dropped significantly. 
</P>
<P>
"We're used to it," Johnson said. "If we didn't have this report card, 
everybody would be looking at (Riley) funny. You're always looking for those 
notes he sends us in the summer and these marks. You always know where you 
stand." 
</P>
<P>
Before talking in generalities about his players' deficiencies, Riley outlined 
his statistical formula. 
</P>
<P>
"We took the (individual) stats from the last three years and their individual 
best year (if it is a different season), then we showed them the team's best 
year, which was (1984-85)," Riley said. "And that's what we've compared to this 
season." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' four "core" players -- Johnson, Worthy, Scott and Green -- are down 
in several areas, according to Riley. 
</P>
<P>
Scott's combined shooting percentage in the four seasons Riley mentioned was 
51.1% This season, Scott has made 45.2% of his shots. Scott had averaged 18.5 
points in the four seasons; 16.1 this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Byron's shooting percentage is down, and he knows he needs to improve on 
that," said Riley, who added that Scott's rebounding and assists totals are 
slightly down from his best season. 
</P>
<P>
Said Scott: "What it is is a friendly reminder of what you're doing out there. 
It doesn't put pressure on you, but it lets you know. Numbers don't lie. I 
mean, you can get 20 points, but not have a good game." 
</P>
<P>
Green, according to Riley, needs to work on his field goal percentage, assists 
and also reduce his fouls. Green's rebounding average has improved from 8.5 a 
game in the four seasons in question to 9.4 this season. But his fouls have 
risen from 2.3 a game to 2.7, and his blocked shots are down to 0.74 from a 
career high of 1.01 in 1986-87. "Across the board, A.C. has to improve in each 
area except his rebounding, which is good," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Green: "I think it's a good evaluation tool. Coach Riley points out those 
things so that you're aware of it. If I can improve 1% in each area, I'll be 
that much better." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Worthy, the two most reliable Lakers, also saw a few statistical 
areas highlighted with a marking pen on their report cards. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy's steals are down from 1.2 over the four-season span to 0.88 this 
season. His shooting percentage has dropped 3% and his turnovers have increased 
to 2.3 from a low of 1.9 in 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the faults Riley found in his game were his field goal percentage 
of 47.1 this season compared to 51.9 in the four seasons, and his 88.8 
free-throw percentage compared to his NBA-best 91.1% last season. 
</P>
<P>
"There are things you still have to improve on as a player," Worthy said. 
"There's a lot of little things, like turnovers. Everybody on the team has a 
category, steals for me. I've got to get my turnovers down to like it was in 
(the 1985-86 season). I've also got to foul less." 
</P>
<P>
Added Johnson: "(Riley) wants my shooting percentage better. He says I'm good 
inside, but it's on the perimeter where I got to improve. The other thing is 
free throws, but I know I'll improve that." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the standard NBA statistics, the Laker staff charts such obscure 
categories as players' shooting accuracy from different spots on the court. 
Center Mychal Thompson, the fifth Laker starter, said every category on his 
report card was highlighted for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's embarrassing," Thompson said. "No matter how long I stayed out of school, 
I still get failing grades. I never made the dean's list in college. But I 
don't care. Just once, I'd like to make Riley's list." 
</P>
<P>
Riley, however, takes these motivational tools seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't going to make or break them, in terms of playing time," Riley said of 
the performance reviews. "But they know it's important. They were nodding at 
me, as if saying, 'You're right.' Well, let's see some results now."

MORNING BRIEFING: THEY TOOK DIFFERENT ROUTES, BUT BOTH WILL BE GIVEN A SALUTE 
</P>

Baseball lost two of its most visible figures last year, Commissioner Bart 
Giamatti and former manager Billy Martin. Baseball historian Warren Goldstein 
contrasted the two for Newsday: 
</P>
<P>
"Italian-Americans both, they had little in common -- just baseball and death 
in the final months of the decade. Still, their anomalous lives remind us of 
the extraordinary richness and power of the game they both loved more than any 
other. 
</P>
<P>
"For all his triumphs as a player and manager, in his soul Billy Martin never 
left his childhood's West Berkeley streets, where his fists starred in the gang 
fight operettas. When you watched him on the dugout steps, you felt a 
consistently unsettling super-concentration. His was, Roger Angell wrote years 
ago, the face 'of a man up an alley when the knives have just come out.' 
</P>
<P>
"Giamatti, hearty and grandiloquent, lived in a different Italy: that of the 
Quattrocento, of Renaissance poetry and Yale Clubs and elegant salons. Billy 
Martin lived in saloons when he wasn't in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Baseball lets us have it both ways. Even more, it doesn't let us choose 
-- it demands that we have it both ways, that we salute A. Bartlett Giamatti 
and Billy Martin." 
</P>
<P>
Add Martin: What chance does Martin have of being elected to the Hall of Fame? 
</P>
<P>
Bob Broeg, former sports editor of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and an 
influential member of the Veterans Committee, said: "Undoubtedly, his name will 
be discussed, but I don't quite see him as a Hall of Famer. He was a volatile, 
aggressive, often winning manager, but I take a dim view of managing as an 
entree to the Hall of Fame. I wish they just took players. Managers like Casey 
(Stengel) are the notable exception." 
</P>
<P>
Hall of Famer Charlie Gehringer, 86, another member of the committee, said: "He 
certainly wouldn't go in as a player. And I don't think a manager is that 
important. If you have a good team, anybody can manage them." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Jan. 3, 1920, Boston Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold 
pitcher-outfielder Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees for $125,000, plus a 
$350,000 loan. The loan was used to produce what Broadway hit? 
</P>
<P>
Board stiff: Hall of Fame defensive lineman Art Donovan, in "Fatso" by Bob 
Drury, on today's NFL players: "Show me a quarterback today, and I'll show you 
a surfer. They got a bunch of beauties now. This guy Troy Aikman that Dallas 
drafted -- they gave him $11.2 million before the guy ever threw a pass in the 
NFL. But he's like the rest of them. . . . He and (John) Elway and (Joe) 
Montana -- they all look like they should be on the Pacific Ocean, hanging 
ten." 
</P>
<P>
Unfriendly skies: San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen writes that when 
a Continental Airlines flight out of Newark, N.J., was two hours late recently, 
the pilot told the passengers, "The Los Angeles Raiders made such a filthy mess 
of this aircraft that it took us two hours to clean it." 
</P>
<P>
Well, almost the same: Chicago Blackhawk defenseman Doug Wilson: "If a concert 
pianist thinks of every key he is going to hit, he's in trouble. Same in 
hockey. When you start thinking instead of reacting, then you've got problems." 
</P>
<P>
On a roll: The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that a Kingman, Ariz., 
real-estate developer, Richard Tomlin, is selling toilet paper bearing the 
likeness of Phoenix Cardinal owner Bill Bidwill. Proceeds are going to a 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: "No, No, Nanette." 
</P>
<P>

upset of the Houston Oilers: "What can you say? We're a lump of coal that,

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ALLAN MALAMUD

<TEXT>
<P>
Lou Holtz should shout, "We're No. 2," and leave it at that. . . . 
</P>
<P>
No. 1? No way. No. 3? No way. The AP sportswriters' poll got it right with 
Miami, Notre Dame and Florida State, in that order. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Florida State might have played the best football the last part of the season, 
but the UPI coaches were being kind to the Seminoles by placing them ahead of 
Notre Dame and behind only Miami. Florida State lost two games. Miami and Notre 
Dame lost one apiece. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And then there is Holtz complaining that his team should be No. 1. I guess he 
wasn't in the Orange Bowl on Nov. 25 when Miami whipped Notre Dame, 27-10. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
The balloting was a little strange, but nothing compared to 1978 when USC 
finished 12-1 and Alabama 11-1. The Trojans beat the Crimson Tide, 24-14, that 
season. At historic Legion Field, no less. Yet Alabama somehow got the writers' 
vote and USC the coaches'. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The most neglected 11-1 team is Tennessee. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I get the feeling that the same people who stuff All-Star ballot boxes make 
multiple calls in those TV polls even if it does cost them a few dollars. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame will have the kind of strong-armed quarterback to utilize the 
talents of Rocket Ismail fully next season. He's 6-foot-3, 205-pound Rick 
Mirer, a freshman who was recognized as the best high school passer in the 
country. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If the Coliseum is rebuilt and USC has to move out for a year, it will find the 
Rose Bowl booked by UCLA on two Trojan home dates. They are Sept. 15 (USC-Penn 
State, UCLA-Stanford) and Oct. 6 (USC-Washington State, UCLA-Arizona). Anybody 
for Anaheim Stadium?. . . . 
</P>
<P>
New Year's Day was a big one for Jackie Robinson's alma mater, Muir High of 
Pasadena. Students Inger Miller and Kandace Watson rode in the Tournament of 
Roses parade as princesses, and alumnus Ricky Ervins was voted MVP of the Rose 
Bowl game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It didn't work, but Alabama executed a high-percentage onside kick near the end 
of the Sugar Bowl. You bounce the ball high off the artificial turf and get the 
equivalent of a basketball jump ball. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bo Schembechler sounded like an NFL coach when he complained about NCAA 
officials: "They don't have enough training. They're not pros. They have other 
jobs." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Heisman '90 update: Illinois is promising quarterback Jeff George a strong 
Heisman push if he plays his senior season instead of opting for the NFL draft. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
And now back to the Pacific 10 basketball race that began sometime late last 
year and then disappeared. . . . 
</P>
<P>
USC, which travels to Westwood tonight, is tied with Oregon State for the 
second most wins by any UCLA rival in Pauley Pavilion. They've each won four, 
two fewer than Notre Dame. The Trojans also have lost 23 since the campus 
facility was opened in the 1965-66 season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Pauley, incidentally, looks as shiny and clean as the night it opened. And you 
can still stick to your diet by sitting in the lower level, where neither food 
nor drink is permitted. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Providence, which is enjoying a banner recruiting year, could join the elite in 
the Big East soon. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Jerry Glanville and Rod Steiger. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Why do people keep asking what's wrong with the Lakers? They're 21-6, compared 
to 17-10 last year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Elgin Baylor should deal at least one of the Clippers' four 
first-round draft choices over the next two years for an experienced inside 
player. The team needs more strength and veteran leadership. . . . 
</P>
<P>
At last glance, Jon Koncak, the Atlanta Hawks' $13.2-million man, was averaging 
four points and four rebounds a game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Most entertaining year-end sports review was Fred Roggin's on Channel 4. Funny 
stuff. . . . Track conditions have a lot more to do with record sprint 
performances by horses than humans, as Sunny Blossom's time of 1:07 1/5 for six 
furlongs at Santa Anita Saturday showed. He had won only six of his previous 22 
starts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The NHL-Soviet exhibition series has become a total waste of time and money. 
Only 6,187 saw the Toronto-Moscow Dynamo game in Maple Leaf Gardens on Sunday. 
And most of the NHL teams have been resting their aces. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sunkist track meet promoter Al Franken notices a big difference in his dealing 
with Soviet track stars lately. Svetlana Kitova, the runner-up in the Grand 
Prix 1,500 meters last year, had a British sports agent represent her in 
negotiations and is getting a $1,200 appearance fee. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The AFC West will be the most improved division in the NFL next season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Only seven more months until the Kickoff Classic.

Anabolic steroids may have a greater effect on the mind than the body of 
athletes, a British television documentary says. 
</P>
<P>
"QED: The Steroid Myth" presents evidence from the United States, Britain and 
Italy challenging the view that the physical effects of steroids can turn good 
athletes into world champions. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea that steroids enhance performance may be another damaging myth," the 
program, scheduled for airing today on British Broadcasting Corporation, 
concludes. 
</P>
<P>
To support this point, the program cites evidence at the University of New 
Mexico at Albuquerque, where a group of male athletes were tested for nine 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
All were injected with a variety of treatments, including steroids and placebos 
-- substances that have no medical effect and are used merely as a testing 
device. 
</P>
<P>
According to the university's Dr. Douglas Crist, there was "no statistical 
significant change in body fat . . . no statistical significant change in 
muscular power." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the athletes reported that they felt stronger.

BIG EAST TRIES TO KEEP LID ON 6-FOUL RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY KEENAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't even think about it. That's what Art Hyland, the Big East's supervisor of 
officials, told the league's referees about the newfangled Six-Foul Rule. Just 
forget it exists. Go ahead with business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no preparation for this, except to tell them that ejection 
occurs after six fouls," said Hyland. "We've done that purposely. We don't want 
the officials to officiate any differently." 
</P>
<P>
After just two league games in December, it's hard to say whether the officials 
have been whistle-happy. One player fouled out (Connecticut's Scott Burrell) 
and four other players reached five fouls without having to leave the game: 
UConn's Nadav Henefeld and Dan Cyrulik; Villanova's Rodney Taylor, and 
Providence's Abdul Shamsid-Deen. So, under last season's rules, five players 
would have fouled out in two games. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm personally in favor of some kind of relief from the present rule, whether 
it's a sixth foul or some other penalty," said Hyland, who suggested extra free 
throws after the fifth foul as an example. "We're dealing with the only sport 
where a player is forced out because of fouls. I think that's difficult to 
rationalize." 
</P>
<P>
In December, the Big East athletic directors voted to sponsor legislation at 
next week's NCAA convention in Dallas that would rescind or delay the 
implementation of controversial Proposal 42 until the Proposition 48 five-year 
study is complete. 
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth season under Prop 48. Proposal 42, which denies athletes who 
do not meet both academic requirements -- a 2.0 grade point average in high 
school core curriculum and a 700 SAT or 15 ACT score -- from receiving any 
institutional financial aid, is to be invoked next fall. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Georgetown officials, the most outspoken opponents of Proposal 42, 
have been lobbying for his vote, St. John's Athletic Director Jack Kaiser said, 
"We've received a fair amount of written material from Georgetown." 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser would not state St. John's position, explaining that it currently is 
being reviewed by the new president, the Rev. Donald J. Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
Lyman DePriest's mother called UConn Coach Jim Calhoun to see if her son could 
skip the Dec. 23 contest against Southern Connecticut and fly home a day early. 
The coach granted this Christmas wish, then said after the 100-37 victory, "I'm 
going to call (Lyman) right now and tell him if he'd have been here, it 
might've been a closer game." 
</P>
<P>
With 2:53 left in Syracuse's 129-72 rout of Division II C.W. Post, Coach Jim 
Boeheim reinserted Derrick Coleman when told that the player needed just one 
assist for his first-ever triple-double. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if that's important," said Boeheim, "but he deserved it. He's so 
unselfish. Probably one of the most unselfish people in the country. He 
probably takes the least amount of shots of any of the great players in the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman needed just 52 seconds to find Tony Scott, who nailed a three-pointer 
to give Coleman 16 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists. 
</P>
<P>
"We left one guy in who could shoot and he got it to him," said Boeheim, not 
exactly complimenting Erik Rogers, Conrad McRae or walk-on point guard Dave 
Bartelstein. 
</P>
<P>
As for Coleman being unselfish, the numbers agree. He has taken just 83 shots 
-- 48 fewer than Billy Owens, 46 fewer than Stephen Thompson, and nine fewer 
than David Johnson. Owens has yet to get a triple-double despite averaging 18.3 
points, 8.6 rebounds and 7.3 assists. 
</P>
<P>
St. John's players keep talking about how well they get along this season. "The 
chemistry is great this year," said Jayson Williams. "Last year nobody spoke up 
because (captain) Matt (Brust) was here. This year, we have more balance. 
Everybody speaks his mind." 
</P>
<P>
Official John Clougherty was supposed to work the Seton Hall-Rutgers game. Big 
deal? Clougherty was the official who made the call on Pirate Gerald Greene 
that sent Michigan's Rumeal Robinson to the line for the game-winning free 
throws in the NCAA title game last March. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been Clougherty's first Seton Hall game since, but he called in 
sick, having suffered broken ribs while stopping a fight in the Navy-Penn game. 
As a Big East official, he's bound to catch up with the Pirates eventually. 
</P>
<P>
"They were trapping with 6-10 and 6-11 NBA players. And we've got a 6-foot 
player whose going to be selling insurance next year," said Cornell Coach Mike 
Dement after losing to Syracuse, 108-56. 
</P>
<P>
Before facing top-ranked Syracuse, Lafayette Coach John Leone told his team, 
"You know, they lace up their sneakers the same way we do. It's not the Celtics 
we're playing." His players looked at him as though he were crazy, so Leone 
said, "Well, it's not the Lakers we're playing." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore: Seton Hall has added 6-1 shooting guard Marco Lokar, 20, of 
Trieste, Italy, to its roster. The freshman is eligible immediately and is said 
to be a four-year player, unlike departed Aussie Andrew Gaze. Lokar was brought 
to P.J. Carlesimo's attention by former Pirate Mergin Sina, who is playing pro 
ball in Italy. ... Georgetown's Dikembe Mutombo is shooting 44 of 58 from the 
field -- an astounding 75.9 percent -- through nine games. But it's not enough 
to qualify him for the NCAA rankings, where he would rank first or second. To 
be counted, a player must make an average of five field goals per game. Mutombo 
is one basket shy. ... Only a junior, Eric Murdock has broken Providence's 
steal record of 207 set by Harold Starks in 86 games from 1983-86. Through 67 
games as a Friar, Murdock has 220 steals.

When he played for the Golden State Warriors, Joe Barry Carroll, or J.B. as he 
was known then, was referred to by a sportswriter as Just Barely Carroll for 
his nonproductive play. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll has switched cities twice since then, but he can't seem to shake his 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
Now even his coach is joining in. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey Net Coach Bill Fitch yanked Carroll after the first six minutes of 
play Tuesday night when Carroll failed to produce a rebound, but the Nets still 
lost on the road to the Washington Bullets, 110-96. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, he's not hurt," Fitch said of Carroll. "I didn't see any 
need to see any more of him out there after the first quarter." 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets also made a change at center, giving Mel Turpin his first start in 
four years, replacing Mark Alarie. Turpin responded with 14 points to augment 
the efforts of Jeff Malone (23 points) and Bernard King (20) as Washington 
broke a five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt real good," said Turpin, whose last NBA start came in his rookie 
season in Cleveland. "They told me this morning. I was surprised, but when they 
call your name, you have to answer the call. If you don't think you can play, 
you shouldn't be in the league." 
</P>
<P>
Purvis Short scored 18 points, and Sam Bowie and Charles Shackleford added 14 
each for New Jersey, now a loser of three in a row and six of its last seven. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 113, New York 99 -- The Knicks' nine-game winning streak, matching the 
Lakers' high for the season, ended as the Suns became the first team to beat 
New York at home this season. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix guard Kevin Johnson scored 11 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter to 
help the Suns pull away. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Johnson scored 22 points and Jeff Hornacek 20 for the Suns, who have won 
three of four road games after losing their first seven away from home. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Wilkins had a season-high 30 points and Patrick Ewing 21 for the Knicks, 
12-1 at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 113, Milwaukee 107 -- People have been saying Moses Malone was slowing 
down since Philadelphia got rid of him nearly four years ago. But here he is, 
in the 1990s, still winning games. 
</P>
<P>
He was a key for the Hawks Tuesday, scoring 31 points -- including hitting all 
17 of his free throws -- along with 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
His four free throws in the last minute assured the Hawks of a victory at home, 
ending the Bucks' five-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Antoine Carr had a season-high 21 points for Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
For Milwaukee, Rickey Pierce came off the bench to score 25 points, 19 in the 
second half. Jack Sikma added 19 points and Alvin Robertson scored 18. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 115, Orlando 113 -- After playing surprising .500 ball through the 
first month of the season, the expansion team in Orlando is losing some of its 
magic and justifying shaky expectations. 
</P>
<P>
The Magic, playing at home, lost for the sixth consecutive time and 14th in the 
last 16 games when the Pistons won at the free-throw line. Detroit scored 15 of 
its last 17 points on free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons' Bill Laimbeer had 26 points and Detroit's only field goal in the 
last six minutes -- a 15-footer that gave the NBA champions a 111-104 lead with 
three minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
James Edwards had 21 points and Joe Dumars added 19 for Detroit, a winner for 
the sixth time in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Otis Smith scored 28 points and Reggie Theus and Terry Catledge had 26 and 22, 
respectively, for the Magic. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando put together a 13-7 run to make it close at the end. Smith's layup 
trimmed the Pistons' lead to 112-110, but the Magic couldn't get any closer in 
the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
The game was marred by eight technical fouls. Orlando's Sidney Green was 
ejected after picking up his second. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 110, Indiana 106 -- Indiana's five-game winning streak ended in Dallas 
when Rolando Blackman scored nine first-quarter points and went on to total 29. 
</P>
<P>
In winning for the fifth time in six games, Dallas was up by as many as 18 
points before Indiana made it close. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Perkins had 24 points and Derek Harper added 23 for Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Miller scored 36 points and Detlef Schrempf contributed 23 for Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 133, Utah 120 -- Terry Teagle scored 36 points in the first half 
and wound up with a career-high 44 on his home court. 
</P>
<P>
Teagle made 14 of 16 shots from the field in the first half, lifting the 
Warriors to a 70-50 lead. At one stretch, Teagle made 12 field goals without a 
miss. 
</P>
<P>
The Jazz got 29 points from Karl Malone. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 119, Miami 95 -- Clyde Drexler scored 25 points, including 15 in the 
third quarter, as the Trail Blazers handed the Heat its seventh loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Duckworth added 24 points to equal his season high for Portland. Glen 
Rice led Miami with 16 points, and Rony Seikaly and Scott Haffner had 14 each.

UCLA'S WALKER GETS FRESH START; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: SENIOR CENTER PUTS SCORING SLUMP BEHIND HIM IN PREPARATION 
FOR GAME AGAINST USC TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While his starting center struggled to escape a four-week slump, UCLA Coach Jim 
Harrick refused to criticize Kevin Walker. 
</P>
<P>
Walker knew, however, that Harrick's patience was wearing thin. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Walker was a starter in name only, introduced to the crowd after 
pregame warmups, but spending more than half of the next 40 minutes on the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
Then, an assistant coach pulled Walker aside one day and told him what Harrick 
would not publicly state, nor even suggest. 
</P>
<P>
"He sat me down and told me that my (limited) production was putting a strain 
on (Harrick) keeping me as a starter," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
He also suggested a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Walker and Harrick met for more than an hour. Afterward, during a 
115-66 rout of East Tennessee State, Walker made six of nine shots, including 
three of three from three-point range, and scored a season-high 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I can definitely use this as a start and consider this the first game 
of my season because everything before this was so bad," Walker said Tuesday, 
as UCLA (8-1 overall and 2-0 in the Pac-10) prepared to play USC (5-3 and 0-2) 
tonight at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
What did Harrick tell him? 
</P>
<P>
"He basically said, 'Your play will dictate your minutes,' so I figured I'd 
better start playing a little better and hopefully my minutes and my production 
would pick up," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick said: "All his problems were mental. He doesn't forget the past and 
think about the future." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, when he started all 31 games, Walker averaged almost 10 points, 
shooting 46.1% from the field, including 66.7% from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-10 shooting guard trapped in a center's body -- he averaged only four 
rebounds a game last season and has averaged only three this season -- Walker 
helped open the inside for forwards Trevor Wilson and Don MacLean, who between 
them averaged 37 points and more than 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
But in UCLA's first eight games this season, Walker averaged only three points, 
shooting 29% from the field and making only one of 16 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
It got so bad that when Harrick brought him off the bench near the end of last 
month's 68-64 victory over Washington State at Pullman, Wash., a fan called out 
from the stands: "Thanks, Coach." Walker made only one of seven shots and 
scored two points. 
</P>
<P>
"My minutes were starting to dwindle and I didn't want the starting job to be a 
consolation prize," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
More and more, he was pulled in favor of freshman Tracy Murray. 
</P>
<P>
Walker's frustration increased. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, that's not a senior season," Walker said. "I kept thinking how bad the 
season was going after I had worked so hard during the summer. I'd think about 
it 24 hours a day. I'd play pretty well in practice, but the games would be a 
totally different situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I started off the first couple of games not shooting well and when I don't 
shoot well, my whole game tends to suffer. I was letting my (poor shooting) 
dictate how I was going to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I was still trying to rebound as best I could and defend, but everything 
revolved around my shooting because I'm known as a shooter. I just put too much 
pressure on myself and I think a game like the other night's can stop all that 
and I can think more positively." 
</P>
<P>
A 230-pounder, Walker is two inches taller and 20 pounds heavier than Murray, 
who is more suited to play forward than center. 
</P>
<P>
"You need Kevin Walker when you face Chris Munk," Harrick said of USC's 6-9, 
230-pound center. "You need him when you face (Louisville's) Felton Spencer and 
when you face the (tall lineups) at Arizona State and Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
After what he has been through, Walker is happy to be needed against anybody.

NHL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
HULL SCORES TWO, BUT OILERS WIN, 6-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Brett Hull took a shot, two good shots as a matter of fact, but still came up 
short of stopping Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Hull, the NHL's co-leader in goals, scored his 34th and 35th of the season for 
St. Louis, but it wasn't enough to stop the visiting Oilers from winning, 6-4. 
It was Edmonton's fifth victory in six games. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton extended its lead over the Kings to seven points. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers were led by Jari Kurri, who had a goal and two assists to reach 
1,000 career points, and Esa Tikkanen, who had two goals. 
</P>
<P>
Kurri became the 25th NHL player to score 1,000 points when he assisted on 
Tikkanen's power-play goal with two minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Edmonton lost to St. Louis was in December of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 5, Buffalo 3 -- The Sabres, leading the Adams Division, lost their 
third consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
John MacLean scored twice, his 22nd and 23rd goals of the season, for the host 
Devils, who are in a fierce battle for first place in the Patrick Division with 
Washington and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey, 8-3-1 in its last 12 games, tied a club record with 23 shots on 
goal in one period. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 4, Vancouver 1 -- Steve Yzerman scored twice in the final period to 
assure the Red Wings of a victory in this struggle of last-place teams. 
</P>
<P>
Glen Hanlon made 32 saves for Detroit, last in the Norris Division. He lost his 
bid for a shutout when Tony Tanti beat him with a low slap shot with 7:21 
remaining in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Yzerman, a 65-goal scorer last season, got his 28th and 29th goals of this 
season, continuing a streak in which he has scored eight goals in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
The Canucks are 1-4-4 in their last nine games and reached the halfway mark 
with a 12-20-8 record, last in the Smythe Division. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary 4, Philadelphia 4 -- Paul Ranheim's goal at 12:53 of the third period 
enabled the Flames to move ahead of the Kings into sole possession of second 
place in the Smythe Division, six points behind Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Ranheim, playing on home ice, took a pass from Jamie Macoun inside the 
Philadelphia blue line and sliced in off the left wing. He beat the long reach 
of defenseman Kjell Samuelsson and flipped a backhand shot over goalie Ken 
Wregget. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 5, Pittsburgh 2 -- The Penguins' Mario Lemieux tied the team record he 
set four years ago when he scored his 26th goal and added an assist, giving him 
a point in 28 consecutive games. It is the fourth-longest streak in league 
history.

MONMOUTH'S 3-POINT BURST BEATS PEPPERDINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pepperdine had defenses for the rest of Monmouth's players, Tuesday night, but 
none to stop the three-point shots of Dave Calloway. 
</P>
<P>
Calloway, a junior guard from Williamstown, N.J., made nine three-pointers, 
tying a Firestone Fieldhouse record and leading the Hawks to a 56-54 victory 
before 1,371. 
</P>
<P>
He finished with a game-high 27 points, making nine of 14 three-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
But Calloway's missed shot on a drive down the lane nearly cost Monmouth a 
chance to win the game in the last seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine had tied the score, 54-54, on a steal by Dexter Howard and a 
breakaway basket by Shann Ferch. 
</P>
<P>
With 12 seconds remaining, Monmouth called a timeout and took the ball out at 
half-court in an attempt to make the winning basket. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks succeeded in getting the ball to Calloway, but he drove the lane and 
missed the shot. Teammate Alex Blackwell got the rebound and made a layup 
shortly before time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
Monmouth (4-6) was trailing, 23-22, in the second half when Calloway went on a 
three-point binge. He made four straight three-pointers around two baskets by 
Craig Davis, and the Hawks went ahead, 32-27, with 14:19 left. Calloway made 
seven three-pointers in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
About four minutes later, the Waves regained the lead, 38-36, on a basket and a 
three-point play by Tom Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
After a sloppy first half, Pepperdine led at intermission, 20-18. 
</P>
<P>
Each team shot 29.2% from the field in the first half, each making seven of 24 
shots. The Waves led only twice -- at 9-8 and at halftime on a Geoff Lear 
basket. 
</P>
<P>
Dexter Howard led Pepperdine (5-6) with 14 points, Craig Davis scored 13 and 
Lewis had 10.

JACKSON GETS 51, LSU STALLS TEXAS, 124-113 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Jackson scored a season-high 51 points as 11th-ranked Louisiana State 
held off a second-half Texas rally for a 124-113 victory Tuesday night at 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson scored eight points in the first 3:29 as the Tigers (7-1), raced to a 
16-3 lead and had a halftime margin of 63-49. 
</P>
<P>
Texas (7-2) cut the deficit to 84-83, but never took the lead. Jackson made 
eight of LSU's next 10 points to put the Tigers back in command. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of talent on this team, and I think we're capable of playing 
like this every night," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers got inside help from Shaquille O'Neal, who had a Southeastern 
Conference record 10 blocked shots, and from Stanley Roberts, who scored a 
career-high 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Blanks scored Texas' first eight points of the second half and led the 
Longhorns with 32 points, and Travis Mays added 30. 
</P>
<P>
"This is truly one of the greatest college basketball games I've ever been 
involved in," LSU Coach Dale Brown said. "We got off to a slow start. I don't 
think I lifted the team enough." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's total tied Southern Methodist's Gene Phillips for the most points 
ever scored against the Longhorns. Phillips scored 51 against Texas on March 2, 
1971. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Jackson set an NCAA Division-I freshman scoring record with 55 
points in one game. His previous high this season was 37 points against 
Southern Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
No. 3 Georgetown 83, Boston College 53 -- Dwayne Bryant, Alonzo Mourning and 
Mark Tillmon led the Hoyas in their Big East Conference opener at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown (10-0, 1-0) led, 43-16, at halftime. The closest Boston College 
(6-5, 0-2) came in the second half was 54-28, with 13:29 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Tillmon scored 18 points, Mourning 17 and Bryant a season-high 16. Doug Able 
scored 15 points and Bryan Edwards added 11 for Boston College, which lost for 
the fourth time in its last five games. 
</P>
<P>
No. 7 Missouri 84, Austin Peay 48 -- Travis Ford scored 18 points, including 
three three-point field goals, to lead the Tigers at Columbia, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
Nathan Buntin led Missouri (12-1) with 10 points and a team-leading nine 
rebounds, and Jamal Coleman came off the bench to add 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
Austin Peay (5-7) scored only 20 points in the first half and 18 field goals 
during the game. Greg Franklin led the Governors with 17 points and Javin 
Johnson added 10. 
</P>
<P>
No. 12 Georgia Tech, 86, Marist 77 -- Dennis Scott scored 26 points, including 
13 in a row in the second half, to lead unbeaten Yellow Jackets at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
With Georgia Tech (9-0) leading, 58-44, Scott made two three-pointers to start 
his 13-point run. The momentum continued in a 24-14 burst that put the game 
away for the Yellow Jackets. Andy Lake led Marist (6-3) with 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
No. 16 St. John's 93, Connecticut 62 -- The Redmen got their seventh 
consecutive victory in their Big East opener at New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Redmen (12-2, 1-0), started the second half with a 14-2 run that gave them 
a 62-34 advantage over the Huskies (10-3, 0-2) with 16:24 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The margin was two points short of St. John's largest in Big East play, a 97-64 
victory over Seton Hall in 1980.

PRINCESS ROYALTY RETURNS TO RACES

<P>
A filly named Princess Royalty makes today's running of the California Breeders 
Champion Stakes at Santa Anita worth watching. 
</P>
<P>
When last seen in the afternoon, Princess Royalty was turning an insignificant 
claiming race at Hollywood Park into a cause celebre that had railbirds 
screeching and the stewards scratching their heads. 
</P>
<P>
Making her competitive debut in the second race on Dec. 22, the daughter of 
Slew's Royalty was listed at 15-1 on the morning line against a mediocre field 
of California-bred maidens. She was bet down to 2-1 by post time and then ran 
her opposition silly, winning by 16 lengths in a quality clocking of 1:10 for 
six furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, Princess Royalty was claimed for $32,000, a price that looked 
like a bargain before the race was half run. Marty Alpert, who owns horses with 
his wife Eileen, looked like the smartest man in the world that day. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been in the market for a Slew's Royalty (offspring), and we'd been 
watching this filly in the mornings," said Alpert, founder of the Big 5 
Sporting Goods chain. "But quite honestly, I didn't go to the races that day 
with the intention of claiming her. I was there to make a bet on a horse in the 
first race. I wasn't even sure she was the right filly until just before the 
races." 
</P>
<P>
As Princess Royalty bounded through the stretch on her way to victory, a chorus 
of boos echoed through the sparse weekday crowd. Stung by what they were 
convinced was a classic betting coup, the fans were showing their displeasure 
for being left out of the loop. Russ Hudak, Hollywood's morning line maker, did 
not blame them at all. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone would feel like they've been slighted somehow," said Hudak, who is 
clocking horses at Fairplex Park during the Santa Anita meet. "My pride was 
already hurt after watching the horse bet down from 15-1. And then for her to 
win the way she did, when her works made it hard to believe she could be ready 
to run such an impressive race." 
</P>
<P>
The Daily Racing Form published its maximum of four workouts for Princess 
Royalty on Dec. 22. None was exceptional. Hudak had access to the filly's prior 
workouts, but he said there was nothing to indicate the ability she showed in 
her race. 
</P>
<P>
"A maiden claiming race like that for 2-year-olds is usually the toughest line 
to make," said Hudak. "Instead of the betting public determining the odds, its 
usually people who know something about the horses who tip the prices one way 
or the other, and then the fans follow along." 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Hector Palma, who prepared Princess Royalty for her impressive debut, 
said he was as surprised as anyone by the margin of victory. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some horses, called morning glories, who work very fast in the 
morning and never run a jump in the afternoon," Palma said. "This filly, I 
think, is just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, she had been bothered by a splint bone," added Palma, describing a 
minor shin condition. "I usually work my horses fast. But I knew she'd be 
running for $32,000, so there was no reason to ask her for that much speed in 
her works. Besides, if she goes off at 15-1, even if she wins, nobody says a 
word." 
</P>
<P>
Palma contends it was a private clocker who touted Princess Royalty around the 
track, drove the price down and inspired Alpert's claim. 
</P>
<P>
"These private clockers got no business on the grounds," Palma said. "They are 
only there to buy and sell horses." 
</P>
<P>
It is the job of the stewards to make sure that any routine inside information 
-- whether it comes from a private clocker or stable personnel -- does not 
cross the line and become a violation of racing rules. 
</P>
<P>
"Horses changing odds that way is not that unusual," said steward Pete 
Pedersen, who was on the phone to Hudak when Princess Royalty's tote-board 
price began to plummet. "But for her to win the way she did, and then to be 
claimed as well, it became a significant matter. Such unusual performances are 
one of our most basic concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"Palma told us that there was a good workout on the filly that did not appear 
in the Racing Form," Pedersen said. "Based on his reputation as someone who 
regularly reports all workouts to the clockers, we've got to give him the 
benefit of the doubt. There's simply no smoking gun. 
</P>
<P>
"So in this case we've found no one that we could say committed an improper 
act," Pedersen added. "But that doesn't mean an improper act wasn't committed." 
</P>
<P>
The fault could lie in the system itself. Hollywood Park, where Princess 
Royalty had been working, is notorious for its poor sight lines when it comes 
to clocking and identifying horses. The main track has several entry points far 
from the stable area. Also, the track dropped one clocker from its payroll 
several years ago, leaving an overworked crew of five. 
</P>
<P>
Even though trainers are obligated to identify a horse before a workout, the 
system has been reduced in many cases to exercise riders shouting out names as 
they gallop past the clockers' stand. Chuck Russell, the senior clocker on the 
local circuit, estimates that his crews are 95% accurate when identifying 
horses. But he hedges when it comes to Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to miss a work, or a trainer wants to try hiding one, that's 
the place it will happen," said Russell, who has been clocking for 21 years. 
"I've asked Hollywood, year after year, to put on more clockers, and nothing 
has happened." 
</P>
<P>
Pedersen sympathizes. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, one of our gravest concerns is that the public not lose its trust 
in the integrity of our clockers," the steward said. "I'd rather have no 
workouts published at all, rather than have inaccurate workouts. A case like 
this is frustrating, because it makes us realize that we have to do a better 
job of guaranteeing the authenticity of workouts." 
</P>
<P>
One thing is for certain: Marty Alpert had a good idea Princess Royalty 
represented at least $32,000 worth of quality. Once he confirmed that the filly 
was indeed the same horse he'd had his eye on, he made a beeline to the 
paymaster's office to fill out the appropriate claiming forms. That was costly, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
"I ended up getting shut out on my bet in the first, and the horse won," Alpert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Princess Royalty, now trained by Jerry Fanning, will have a chance to get 
Alpert even and then some in today's $141,500 Breeders Champion Stakes, a race 
that has been won in the past by such quality California-bred fillies as Rascal 
Lass, Kool Arrival, A Kiss for Luck and Fabulous Notion. 
</P>
<P>
"Gary Stevens got off her after a work the other morning and said she felt like 
Akinemod," said Alpert, referring to the Fanning-trained winner of Monday's La 
Brea Stakes. "I think we've got a good one." 
</P>
<P>
And Palma will be watching with mixed feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I was sorry to lose the filly," he said. "But you know, the day after 
she won we had 15 calls asking for a breeding to Slew's Royalty. As long as I'm 
not running against her, I'll be rooting for her." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Princess Royalty is from the first crop of Slew's Royalty, a swaybacked son of 
Seattle Slew whose brilliance was compromised by chronic unsoundness. Hector 
Palma nursed him through seven starts to four wins and a third in the San Diego 
Handicap. . . . The best of the 3-year-old Cal-bred fillies might have run on 
Monday. Not So Careless, a daughter of Desert Wine bred and owned by film 
producer Ray Stark, broke her maiden by 1 1/4 lengths after being in trouble 
for most of the 6 1/2 furlongs. She is a half sister of Fabulous Notion and is 
trained by Bobby Frankel.

O.C. BOARD NAMES CAPIZZI AS D.A.; CHALLENGER SUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Michael R. Capizzi, Cecil Hicks' longtime choice to succeed him as Orange 
County district attorney, was unanimously selected for the job by the Board of 
Supervisors on Tuesday, just moments before Hicks took the oath as a Superior 
Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi, 50, who has held the title of chief assistant since 1986, directed 
Hicks' campaign against political corruption in the 1970s. He also was 
architect of most of Hicks' major policies in the 1980s, including an end to 
most plea bargaining and closed-door agreements with defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
But his first battle as district attorney may be over the right to keep his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef, one of two challengers to Capizzi within the 
office in the June, 1990, election, filed legal action Tuesday afternoon in 
Superior Court in an attempt to void the supervisors' vote. He was joined by 
Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. Enright, who was next in line to succeed 
Hicks if the supervisors had not acted. 
</P>
<P>
Court Commissioner Julian Cimbaluk has set a Feb. 2 hearing date on Avdeef's 
complaint that the board does not have the authority to replace Hicks. Avdeef 
contends that the law requires that Enright, as chief deputy, replace Hicks 
until a new district attorney is elected. The hearing is scheduled before 
Superior Court Judge Eileen Moore. 
</P>
<P>
If Avdeef's effort fails, Capizzi's appointment Tuesday to serve out the final 
year of Hicks' term means he can run on the June ballot for the 1991-1995 term 
as the incumbent. Most legal and political experts in the county believe that 
would make him unbeatable. Avdeef and Assistant Dist. Atty. Edgar A. Freeman, 
the third candidate in the June race, acknowledge that it will give him "a 
startling advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Few people expect Avdeef's challenge to succeed. Board Chairman Thomas F. Riley 
said he has been assured by the county counsel's office that the supervisors 
have the authority to appoint Hicks' replacement. 
</P>
<P>
There was a small uproar in 1966 when Hicks himself was appointed to fill the 
term of retiring Dist. Atty. Kenneth Williams. But that challenge died without 
going to court. The board has routinely made appointments to fill such 
positions without challenge. 
</P>
<P>
But Avdeef, in a letter to Riley, said he was bringing the issue to the board's 
attention to spare the supervisors "embarrassment." The claim in his lawsuit 
essentially is that the supervisors, as a county body, do not have the 
authority to make an appointment to what amounts to a state agency. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom (Avdeef) is wrong on the law," Capizzi said. "This just doesn't have any 
merit." 
</P>
<P>
If Capizzi was upset by the Avdeef lawsuit, which had been promised for weeks, 
he did not show it. He spent most of the afternoon accepting congratulatory 
telephone calls. A highlight of the day and his career, he said, was to have 
Cecil Hicks administer the oath of office with Capizzi's own family, including 
his mother, Adelaide, watching. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks had endorsed Capizzi's candidacy before his judicial appointment came 
through. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks, 63, who has been district attorney for 23 years, announced five months 
ago that he would not seek reelection in June. Soon after that he let Gov. 
George Deukmejian know of his interest in a judgeship. The governor appointed 
him to the bench on the Friday before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Because Hicks' name is listed on all the criminal pleadings before the court, 
he will not be able to handle criminal cases for a year or two. He was 
appointed by Judge Leonard Goldstein, the new presiding judge, to Department 8, 
which is a family law courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them I'd go wherever I was needed," Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks told reporters that the judicial code of conduct limited any further 
comment on Capizzi's candidacy, but added, "I can say that he is an 
exceptionally outstanding choice to replace me." 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef was present at the Hall of Administration when the supervisors vote 5 to 
0 to appoint Capizzi. While he had said earlier that he might voice his 
objections, he sat silently as the supervisors took turns lavishing praise on 
Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton described Capizzi as Hicks' "field general in the 
war on political corruption" in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike did his job so well that those who would corrupt our political system are 
out of positions of power," Stanton said. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks' investigations led to 42 indictments of political figures during those 
years. The charges stemmed primarily from misuse of public funds, money 
laundering and bribery. Among those indicted were a congressman, Andrew J. 
Hinshaw, and three county supervisors, Robert Battin, Ralph Diedrich and Philip 
Anthony. Battin and Diedrich were forced from office and Anthony, while under 
indictment, was defeated for reelection by Stanton in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez called Capizzi "tough but fair" and said he is 
someone "who will continue that tradition of leadership built by Cecil Hicks." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder quipped that she benefited from Capizzi's 
housecleaning when she began her own political career in the county in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have some of the problems my predecessors had about where the files 
were," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi began his career in the district attorney's office in 1965 right after 
passing the bar. He worked his way up to assistant -- a rank above deputy -- in 
1971. 
</P>
<P>
During the early 1980s, Enright was second-in-command on paper as chief deputy. 
But Hicks in the mid-1970s had turned over most of the major duties for 
day-to-day operations to Capizzi. In 1986, Hicks tried to make Capizzi's powers 
within the office clearer by creating for him the title of chief assistant. 
Enright was still second-in-command in the statutes, but it was Capizzi's name 
under Hicks' in the county directory. 
</P>
<P>
No one within the office doubts who had the real power. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike's appointment really won't mean much different for us," said one deputy 
prosecutor. "He's been running the office for years anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Some in the office had seen Enright as the only viable candidate to run against 
Capizzi in the June election. But Enright has been silent so far about whether 
he will. Many believe now that if he is interested, he has waited too long. 
</P>
<P>
But Enright did feel strongly enough about Capizzi's appointment to ask Avdeef 
if he could join his lawsuit, said Avdeef attorney Kevin McDermott. 
</P>
<P>
Enright's declaration states that he, not Capizzi, has always been in charge 
any time Hicks was out of town or on vacation. Enright also noted that the 
supervisors have never inquired about his interest in replacing Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
Enright and Capizzi have long held a friendly but adversarial relationship 
within the office. While Enright is popular with rank-and-file deputies, 
Capizzi has the support of most of the top supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi is a former president of the Orange County Bar Assn. He won the 
prestigious Outstanding Prosecutor award from the California District Attorneys 
Assn. in 1980 for his political prosecutions. Capizzi received a bachelor of 
science degree from Eastern Michigan University in 1961 and his law degree from 
the University of Michigan in 1964, joining the Orange County district 
attorney's office shortly thereafter.

CAPIZZI'S ASCENSION LONG FORESEEN

He's never had another job. From the time he passed his bar exams in 1965, 
Michael R. Capizzi has been a prosecutor in the Orange County district 
attorney's office. And for more than half of those 25 years, he has been the 
heir apparent to the top post. 
</P>
<P>
When Dist. Atty. Cecil Hicks announced last August that he would not seek 
reelection after 23 years in office, almost everyone expected that Capizzi, his 
chief assistant and hand-picked favorite, would eventually replace him. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came to the office in the 1970s it was just assumed Mike Capizzi would 
be the next district attorney," said one former deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors made it official. After lavishing praise on 
the 50-year-old prosecutor, board members unaniimously selected him to replace 
Hicks, who was appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian to a Superior Court 
judgeship on Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi, who serves until the end of the year, will run for the 1991-1995 term 
in June against Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef and Assistant Dist. Atty. 
Edgar A. Freeman. Avdeef has already filed legal action challenging the board's 
right to appoint anyone before the election. But neither is considered a threat 
to Capizzi in June, especially with Capizzi running as the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Most believe that Capizzi will be the county's chief prosecutor throughout the 
1990s. That brings a few groans from some deputies within the office, and from 
a few former prosecutors. They find Capizzi cold or sometimes insensitive in 
dealing with promotions. 
</P>
<P>
But generally, Capizzi commands respect within the ranks, and many who say they 
were bothered at first by his cool demeanor have become his strongest 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"He is an extremely aggressive prosecutor," said one former colleague. "If you 
liked Cecil Hicks, you will love Mike Capizzi. If you didn't like Cecil Hicks, 
you will hate Mike Capizzi." 
</P>
<P>
That former prosecutor and many others now within the office revere Capizzi for 
his brilliance as a lawyer and what one called his "impeccable honesty." 
</P>
<P>
"I used to cringe when he would come to me with a legal question," one 
prosecutor said. "Because you knew that Capizzi had already done the research 
and already knew the answer. He was just trying to see if he had overlooked 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
One prosecutor exuberant about the Capizzi appointment is Ventura County Dist. 
Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, a longtime friend Capizzi met through the state 
district attorneys' association. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Mike Capizzi 10 years ago that someday he would be district attorney," 
Bradbury said. "He is an outstanding choice; Orange County should consider 
itself very lucky." 
</P>
<P>
But however bright he may be, no one is certain, even Capizzi himself, how he 
managed to stand out among the other deputies in Cecil Hicks' eyes at such an 
early age. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps it's because Cecil and I think very much alike," Capizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither denies his strong affection for the other. When Capizzi took the oath 
of office an hour after the board appointment, he asked Hicks if he would 
administer it. It was fitting, since Hicks was there at the beginning of 
Capizzi's career too. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi got his law degree from the University of Michigan in 1964 and soon 
headed west. The cold winters helped him give up thoughts of a career in 
Detroit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor who interviewed him for his first job was Cecil Hicks, then a 
chief deputy in the office. 
</P>
<P>
At age 32, after just six years in the office, Capizzi was elevated by Hicks, 
then district attorney, to one of just five assistant positions -- a rank above 
deputy. Capizzi was placed in charge of special operations. Many believe that 
it was in the late 1970s that Hicks and Capizzi cemented their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi became what Supervisor Roger R. Stanton has called Hicks' "field 
general" in a series of investigations into political corruption in the county. 
More than 40 political figures, including three county supervisors and a 
congressman, were indicted, many of them winding up in jail. 
</P>
<P>
According to one former prosecutor, "Cecil believed very much in these 
political cases, and he found that Capizzi deeply believed in them too." 
</P>
<P>
After those prosecutions, the former prosecutor theorized, Hicks found himself 
increasingly confiding in Capizzi as he spent less time sharing his views with 
other supervisors within the office. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi said he believes that their relationship is more broadly based than 
that. But he remembers those years as exciting times. 
</P>
<P>
"There was much criticism because these people we were after had many friends 
within the county," Capizzi said. "But we did it because it was the right thing 
to do."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; 
</P>
<P>
REDEVELOPMENT PLAN ON LIST OF PRIORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Now that the initial problems of creating a city are over, Dana Point can 
concentrate on coming up with a redevelopment strategy, developing a general 
plan and increasing services, said Mayor Eileen Krause. 
</P>
<P>
Monday marked the first anniversary of the incorporation of Orange County's 
28th city. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a fast year," Krause said. "We've got ourselves a small foundation 
started. Now we've got to expand on it." 
</P>
<P>
Of all the tasks facing the city, Krause said, she was most enthusiastic about 
redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
Within 90 days, the city staff plans to complete a study pinpointing the city's 
areas of decay. No specific plans have been discussed, but new housing, 
shopping malls and hotels are typical projects, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Redevelopment is a powerful tool," Krause said. "It gives you a lot of money 
to upgrade a whole area of the city at once." 
</P>
<P>
In the next year, the city must also produce a general plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We are required to submit a general plan to the county within 30 months (of 
incorporation)," Krause said. The plan will affect not only land-use and 
traffic, but also "the overall quality of life for citizens," she said. "That's 
why we will actively seek public input." 
</P>
<P>
Krause said Dana Point's new autonomy helps cut red tape on small problems. 
</P>
<P>
For example, shortly after city incorporation, a mini-market franchise to be 
built near Dana Hills High School sought a liquor license, Krause said. Before 
incorporation, the residents who opposed that license would have had to drive 
to Santa Ana to plead their case before the County Board of Supervisors. 
Instead they protested to the City Council, which enacted an urgency ordinance 
to prohibit sale of alcohol within 500 feet of the school. 
</P>
<P>
"As a city, citizens can get what they want," Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the services Dana Point residents will receive this year is street 
sweeping, which will start in March, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, residents will be able to dispose of large household items, such 
as sofas and refrigerators, during city-sponsored cleanup days, which will be 
held at least twice a year. The dates will be announced, Krause said.

Organizers of an effort to create a city out of three South County communities 
north of Mission Viejo are scheduled to announce today that they are launching 
a petition drive in an effort to qualify for the November election. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the plan to incorporate El Toro, Lake Forest and Portola Hills 
have called a 3:30 p.m. press conference in front of Heritage Hill Historical 
Park on Serrano Road near Lake Forest Drive, said Helen Wilson, president of 
Community Coalition for Incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
If incorporated, El Toro would become the 30th city in Orange County and the 
third South County community to incorporate in as many years. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just going to announce to the world that we are ready to go forward," 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers are expected to release updated results of financial studies that 
show the proposed city to be financially able to support itself, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
An earlier financial feasibility report showed that if the communities were 
incorporated into one city in fiscal year 1988-89, the local government would 
have a $5-million surplus, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Christiansen, an Oceanside financial consultant, is expected to complete a 
full financial-feasibility study within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
That study, which compares anticipated city revenues with expenses, should show 
a 25% to 30% reserve in the proposed city's first year of operation, Wilson 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
Coalition members are expected to begin gathering signatures at area shopping 
centers on Saturday, Wilson said. The group needs to gather signatures from 25% 
of the area's 28,000 registered voters to qualify a ballot measure for the 
November election. 
</P>
<P>
Once the feasibility study is complete, the group will approach the Orange 
County Local Agency Formation Commission to formally apply for cityhood. JAMES.

QUAKE-SENSITIVE BUILDINGS LISTED

<P>
The City Council on Tuesday received a report identifying eight potentially 
hazardous, unreinforced masonry buildings in the Old Town area. 
</P>
<P>
The Community Development Department was required by state law to compile the 
report because unreinforced buildings of brick and other masonry materials do 
not withstand earthquakes well. 
</P>
<P>
Such buildings were built before seismic safety codes were enforced and do not 
have steel bars embedded in the walls. 
</P>
<P>
The buildings are: 
</P>
<P>
* Swinging Door/Surfas Furriers, 355 and 365 El Camino Real, built in 1922. 
</P>
<P>
* Tustin Pythian Building, 397 and 399 El Camino Real and 135, 145 and 155 Main 
St., built in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
* Perfit Building, 165, 185, 191, 193 and 195 E. Main St., built in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
* Dance School Building, 401 and 405 El Camino Real and 120, 130, 140 and 150 
E. Main St., built in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
* Tustin Hardware, 115 W. Main St., built in 1912. 
</P>
<P>
* Diocese of Orange, 130 W. Main St., built in 1914. 
</P>
<P>
* Rose Marie's Draperies, 138 W. Main St., built in 1914, modified in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
* Rutabegorz, 140, 148, 150 and 158 W. Main St., built in 1914. 
</P>
<P>
The city is submitting the list to the state Seismic Safety Commission and will 
notify property owners soon. By July, city officials expect to develop an 
ordinance requiring structural repairs to the buildings. Public hearings on the 
ordinance will be held soon. 
</P>
<P>
The city may provide incentives to owners for reinforcing their buildings by 
making available up to $2,000 in Community Development Block Grant funds for 
engineering and design, planning and construction costs. SHANNON SANDS

PROBLEMS OF GROWTH TARGETED BY MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE BOZANICH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Working with surrounding cities to manage growth and coping with a declining 
sales tax base will be the key issues facing Los Alamitos in the year ahead, 
according to Mayor Robert P. Wahlstrom. 
</P>
<P>
While little undeveloped land remains in the city, problems associated with 
growth such as traffic and air quality are the key concerns as 1990 begins, 
according to Wahlstrom. 
</P>
<P>
"It is more of a regional thing than a local thing," he said. "We have to work 
with the various communities around us to solve these problems. We can't combat 
traffic and pollution alone." 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos has a formal agreement with neighboring Cypress that it be 
notified when any major development -- defined as anything of one acre or more 
-- is planned. Wahlstrom said he would like to see more such cooperative 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Congestion on Katella and Cerritos avenues and Los Alamitos Boulevard will 
continue to be a concern in 1990, he said. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, the city will continue to work closely with the county in its 
plans to turn Katella Avenue into a "super street," according to Wahlstrom. It 
will be upgraded in the coming years with synchronized signals, bus turnouts, 
dual left-turn lane pockets, fewer driveways and possibly no on-street parking. 
</P>
<P>
The decrease in sales tax revenue, a major source of money for the city, this 
past year also has the city casting a wary eye toward the future, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It slipped last year, and of course the cost of maintaining the city is always 
increasing," he said. "We still have a balanced budget, but this is something 
we definitely will be watching." 
</P>
<P>
If money is available come the midyear budget review sessions in January, there 
are three specific projects "on the council's wish list," Wahlstrom said. They 
are the installation of a traffic signal in front of Los Alamitos High School, 
building restrooms at Little Cottonwood Park and remodeling the youth 
center.KATHIE BOZANICH

AQMD HAS COMMUTER ON THE RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Eric Newman leaves his house in the early morning gloom and dashes off to work. 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton fire captain doesn't run out the door because he's late. He's 
earning a day off from work. 
</P>
<P>
Newman earned an extra day off in December by taking the city up on its 
challenge to stop driving solo to work and to find an alternative means of 
getting there. About 180 other city workers also earned a day off or $120 in 
cash -- whichever they chose -- by cutting down the number of times they drove 
to work alone in a six-month period. 
</P>
<P>
Since June, Newman, 35, has traded his Chevrolet Suburban for his Etonic 
Streetfighters running shoes on all but two morning commutes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only way to go," said Newman, a Fullerton resident who runs about 
five miles to various city fire stations. "It's doing my bit to help the 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District requires all employers in the 
south coast air basin with 100 or more employees at one location to implement a 
program aimed at cutting the number of employees driving cars to work. Reduced 
automobile trips will mean reduced smog, said Claudia Keith, AQMD spokeswoman. 
About 7,500 businesses will be affected, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of AQMD's program is to cut the miles driven by rush-hour commuters by 
25%. If the program is successful, carbon monoxide pumped into the air will be 
reduced by 100 to 200 tons a day and ozone-producing gases by 25 to 60 tons a 
day, the AQMD predicts. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, which began its trip-reduction program in June, uses the days off 
and the $120 in pay to encourage its workers to car-pool, airplane-pool, walk, 
bicycle, take a bus or even run to work. The money and vacation days will cost 
$50,000 to $76,000 a year, said Kenneth Bane, a city planner who helps 
administer the city program. 
</P>
<P>
The city's goal is to increase the average number of people in each car from 
the 1.08 it was in early 1989 to 1.5, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim, Santa Ana, Irvine and Costa Mesa also have AQMD trip-reduction 
programs. Several other Orange County cities are preparing their plans. 
</P>
<P>
In the past six months, Fullerton's program has encouraged about 300 workers to 
use alternative commuting methods, about 200 of whom have stuck with it for 
most of that time, Bane said. 
</P>
<P>
Newman has participated by running or bicycling to his 24-hour shifts. 
</P>
<P>
The firefighter leaves home about 6:45 a.m. and usually runs along Orangethorpe 
Avenue, Lemon Street, Chapman Avenue, State College Boulevard and Commonwealth 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"I stick to the major streets to avoid the dogs," he said. "You don't have to 
run as fast that way." 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters have been some of the most faithful employees in the 
trip-reduction program, Bane said. At Station 1, where Newman is assigned, 
three bicycles hang from hooks in the shop room. 
</P>
<P>
One of the bikes often hanging from the wall belongs to Battalion Chief John 
Clark, 46, who pedals 15 miles from Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real good feeling of satisfaction, and I also feel I'm in much better 
shape than I was," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the city offered the day off from work, he would bicycle to work only 
occasionally. Now, he said, he cycles about 60% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim has achieved its goal of 1.5 for Civic Center employees, said Martine 
Micozzi, who manages the city's one-year-old program. Anaheim encourages 
employees to reduce car trips by offering shorter work weeks, subsidized van 
pools, bicycle lockers and other incentives. 
</P>
<P>
In Irvine, only about 50 employees are signed up for the program, said 
Bernadette Impellizeri, who recently was hired full time to run the city's 
program. TOM McQUEENEY

that encourages commuters to find alternative means of getting to work. The 
program's goal is to reduce the number of cars on the road and, therefore, 
reduce smog.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;

<P>
PETITION PLANNED TO FORCE VOTE ON ARENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK LANDSBAUM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An opponent of the city's proposed $85-million indoor sports arena said Tuesday 
that he will try to halt the project by circulating a petition to force the 
issue onto the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mayor Fred Hunter, a chief proponent of the 20,000-seat facility, said 
he is unconcerned with the threatened referendum, which comes on the heels of 
the City Council's rezoning of property last week for the arena northeast of 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see it (the referendum) getting off the ground at all," Hunter said. 
"I don't think that's really the will of the voters in this city. Anaheim is 
the type of city that has recreational activities. We're a tourist capital." 
</P>
<P>
But attorney Robert Coldren, who represents the owner of the Orange Tree mobile 
home park next to the arena site, said a petition signed by 5% or 10% of 
Anaheim registered voters -- depending on the turnout in the last election -- 
can force the council to place the matter on the ballot at the next regular 
election, to call a special election, or to rescind the rezoning. 
</P>
<P>
Coldren said he and his client, Campanula Properties Inc., are still 
considering a lawsuit to challenge the council's actions. "We believe this 
matter should be put to a vote of the people," said Coldren, who maintains that 
the city rushed approval of the arena, giving inadequate consideration to 
increased traffic and other environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
"We will circulate a petition indicating the matter should be put up to a 
vote," he said. A referendum would have the effect of staying the rezoning 
until the issue can be decided at the polls, Coldren said. 
</P>
<P>
The council has also adopted a controversial environmental report on the arena 
and authorized the purchase of three acres for the project on Douglass Road, 
north of Katella Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Ground breaking is expected in early February, following a mandatory 30-day 
waiting period to allow legal challenges to the environmental report. City 
officials hope to open the arena and attract a professional basketball team or 
hockey team by the fall of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Coldren said that in the city's "mad rush" for an arena, officials committed 
several procedural mistakes that leave the council's approval open to legal 
challenge. The Los Angeles Rams and California Angels, who play their home 
games a block from the proposed arena, have expressed similar concerns with the 
city's environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
Coldren and other arena critics contend that the city sped approval of the 
arena because of competition from a nearly identical facility proposed in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
But Hunter defends the approval process. He also said Coldren has misjudged 
public sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
A referendum "is a very difficult thing to do," said Hunter, who maintains that 
there is "overwhelming support" for the facility. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a slow-growth issue," Hunter said. "The attorney is way off base 
on this one. He doesn't know Anaheim." MARK LANDSBAUM

MAYOR FEELS DRIVEN TO FINISH ROAD WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several long-awaited improvements to traffic flow will be completed in 1990, 
and work on at least one other major transportation project will begin. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Peter F. Buffa said he also expects the City Council to approve a new 
General Plan by March or April, culminating four years of work to design a new 
blueprint for the city's development. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't remember a time in Costa Mesa when there wasn't some kind of street 
project disruption for drivers to cope with, and it's nice to have the 
resurfacing and flood control improvement project on Harbor Boulevard completed 
this year," Buffa said. 
</P>
<P>
But residents will have to be patient a while longer as the widening of 
Victoria Street continues into 1990, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That project, which is about 20 years late and desperately needed, is 
scheduled for completion this year, along with a comprehensive redevelopment of 
the Triangle Square area," Buffa said. 
</P>
<P>
Work is also scheduled to begin this year to complete the Costa Mesa Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"We have waited over 20 years to finish this project, and I'm really glad to 
see it finally come about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Buffa, who along with Councilman Orville Amburgey is up for reelection this 
year, predicted that the painstaking process of approving the new General Plan 
will proceed without major delays. 
</P>
<P>
"We seem to be striking a balance between the Proposed General Plan presented 
by the City Council and an alternative plan proposed by a citizens' steering 
committee," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan will set the city's first building limits for commercial, industrial 
and institutional land-uses and will reduce the limits for high-density 
residential development. 
</P>
<P>
Future hearings will center on a new land-use designation affecting the Home 
Ranch project, which has been the subject of an extended battle between 
developers and slow-growth proponents. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are the major issues facing us, but there are several sidelights that 
are rather important to me," Buffa said. He cited the Police Department's plan 
to add an anti-gang unit to work with schools, and tentative plans to expand 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service Jobs Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Volunteers from our community literacy project have begun an experimental 
project there to teach English to the workers, and I'm very interested in their 
success," he said. JANICE L. JONES

OVERSIZE BILLBOARD DECISION POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the Planning Commission's recommendation, Councilman John Acosta 
Tuesday night asked the council to allow construction of three billboards at 
least twice the maximum legal size. 
</P>
<P>
But after protests from council colleagues and city residents, Councilman 
Daniel E. Griset called for a postponement of the vote, now set for Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Griset said Acosta's proposal was "gutting community standards" and called 
billboards "an environmental hazard, a piece of clutter in a busy city which we 
don't need." 
</P>
<P>
Acosta replied: "I think you speak with forked tongue. In the last election I 
saw your face on all the billboards you call clutter." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana's city code limits billboards to 35 feet in height and 300 feet 
square. 
</P>
<P>
The three proposed billboards near the Costa Mesa and Garden Grove freeways all 
exceed the height restriction by several feet and are at least twice the size 
in square footage. 
</P>
<P>
One of the billboards, proposed for 2701 S. Grand Ave., would be 65 feet tall 
and three times the allowed square footage. The other two billboard locations 
are at 800 E. Dyer Road and 1969 S. Ritchey St. Regency Outdoor Advertising is 
proposing two of the billboards. J.K. Consulting Services is proposing the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
In reports to the City Council, the Planning Commission recommended against a 
total of nine oversize billboards, including these three, saying they would 
distract drivers and hurt the area's appearance. The council is expected to 
vote on the other six billboards at future meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Mark LaFont told the council Tuesday, "If a poll was taken among Santa 
Ana residents now, nobody would accept these kinds of billboards." LILY ENG

FULLERTON HIGH PRINCIPAL ANTHONY MASON DIES AT 40

<TEXT>
<P>
Anthony Louis Mason, principal of Fullerton High School, has died at UC San 
Diego Medical Center of complications of cancer. He was 40. 
</P>
<P>
The former college basketball star and mathematics teacher was described by 
students and colleagues Tuesday as a man possessed of both a sense of humor and 
a sense of purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"He was one of those people you go to when you need someone to talk to," said 
Frank McCarroll, the varsity basketball coach at La Habra High School, where 
Mason served as assistant principal for two years before being appointed 
Fullerton High principal in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great loss for (Fullerton) because he would have done wonderful things 
for that school," McCarroll said. 
</P>
<P>
Colleen Curz, a junior at Fullerton High, remembered him as a tall, slim, 
bearded man who used to joke to students that he looked like Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
"Most kids don't like administration, but they thought he was really nice," 
Curz said. 
</P>
<P>
During his first few months at Fullerton High, Mason put in motion a plan to 
improve the school's reading test scores, said Assistant Principal Pat Putnam. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a really great man," said Natalie Reed, vice president of the junior 
class at Fullerton High. "He was always involved . . . always talking to the 
kids. Everybody really liked him a lot." 
</P>
<P>
When Fullerton High drama students learned that Mason was to be hospitalized in 
early December, Reed said, they decided to stage a special showing of their 
school play as a tribute. 
</P>
<P>
"They did a special performance just so he could see it," Reed said. "They 
surprised him. He went in and they did the whole play for him, and they gave 
him an ice cream sundae to eat while he watched." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Glendale, Mason had lived in Orange County for 22 years. He attended 
Antelope Valley High School in Lancaster, and graduated from Chapman College in 
1970. 
</P>
<P>
According to Putnam, Mason was a basketball coach and math teacher in the 
Orange Unified School District before becoming an administrator there, and also 
served as an assistant principal in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Mason, who died Saturday, is survived by his wife, Alicia, and four children, 
Kyle, Christina, Aaron and Jennifer of Fullerton; his mother, Betty Jane Mason 
of Ventura; two brothers, Stephan A. Mason of Ventura and Gerald E. Mason of 
Los Angeles; and his grandmother, Margaret Olson of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
A Rosary and memorial service will be at 7:30 tonight at St. Juliana Falconieri 
Church, 1316 N. Acacia Ave., Fullerton. A funeral Mass will be celebrated there 
at 10 a.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The family asks that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to a scholarship 
memorial fund in Mason's name. Checks should be made out to Dollars for 
Scholars and mailed to the Fullerton Joint Union High School District, 780 
Beechwood Ave., Fullerton, Calif. 92635, in care of Shirley Finton.

COACHES' TASK: WINTERIZING FALL ATHLETES; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH SCHOOLS: SOME MAKE THE CHANGE FROM FOOTBALL, WRESTLING AND VOLLEYBALL TO 
BASKETBALL EASILY. OTHERS FIND IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.

<P>
Tim Manning and Jim Farbaniec didn't have much time to celebrate after helping 
Trabuco Hills High School win the Division VIII football championship in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
One day after the Mustangs beat Orange, 13-7, for their second consecutive 
Division VIII title, Manning and Farbaniec were back in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball uniforms, that is. 
</P>
<P>
Manning, a quarterback and a defensive back, threw for a touchdown and 
intercepted a pass in the Friday night football championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four hours later, he came off the bench and played 15 minutes, scoring 
two points in a 67-64 victory over Mission Viejo in the third-place game of the 
Trabuco Hills tournament. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a great performance for Manning, who scored 15 and 17 points in games 
the next two weeks, but it was a start. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim and I went out there, looked at each other and laughed," said Manning, a 
6-foot, 180-pound senior. "We couldn't believe we were doing this. We had just 
won CIF and we were still thinking football." 
</P>
<P>
Manning and Farbaniec are among several Orange County high school athletes who 
make the transition between fall and winter sports. 
</P>
<P>
Some, such as Manning, make the transition easily. Others have difficult, even 
painful experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Farbaniec didn't play against Mission Viejo and was used as a substitute the 
next few weeks. He was still struggling to learn all of the Mustangs' plays. 
</P>
<P>
"We had just won the football championship and I was ready to celebrate," said 
Farbaniec, a 6-4, 260-pound offensive and defensive tackle. "But there I was 
going out and running drills for basketball. It was kind of tough for the first 
few days." 
</P>
<P>
The transition can be particularly frustrating for basketball coaches. 
</P>
<P>
They sometimes struggle early in the season because their best players are 
playing football or volleyball. And, once the players do arrive, their shots 
often draw iron but no net. 
</P>
<P>
Rainer Wulf, Trabuco Hills basketball coach, said he encouraged Manning and 
Farbaniec to play football. But their absence early in the basketball season 
caused problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The positive is that they're doing well in another sport, then come in here 
after winning the CIF championship and they're really pumped up," Wulf said. 
"It injects some energy back into the team. 
</P>
<P>
"But we had to wait to put in some of our presses and things we do offensively 
until Tim got here. They wouldn't work without him in there." 
</P>
<P>
The late arrivals sometimes create frustrating practices. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Henshall, girls' basketball coach at El Dorado, has four volleyball players 
on his team. He spends the first few weeks of practice working with them on 
rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
"They're used to tipping the ball instead of shooting it," he said. "I keep 
reminding them to catch the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Brande, girls' volleyball coach at Corona del Mar, said most volleyball 
players sit out the basketball season to compete for club volleyball teams. 
</P>
<P>
"Because there are so many volleyball scholarships available, it's more 
attractive for them to specialize (in volleyball)," he said. "That's wrong. We 
try to work our club season around so they can play basketball too." 
</P>
<P>
Although Manning's football and basketball seasons overlapped, he had few 
problems adjusting. He is in his third year of varsity basketball and had 
played during the summer, so he picked up the offensive plays right away. 
</P>
<P>
"I still wasn't the player I was last summer," he said. "I was averaging 24 or 
25 (points) last summer." 
</P>
<P>
It was even tougher for Farbaniec, who sat out the basketball season as a 
junior to concentrate on academics and train for the shot put and discus events 
in the upcoming track season. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim had taken a year off from basketball (so) he had to relearn everything," 
Wulf said. "It took a couple of weeks before I could call a play and he 
wouldn't look at me like, 'Uh oh, what was this one?' " 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills had a two-week break in its schedule after playing in the San 
Dieguito tournament in mid-December. Manning said the break has provided a 
chance to get comfortable with the Mustangs' offense. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting everything burned back into our minds," Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes make more than a physical transition, though. 
</P>
<P>
Trevor Cooper of Huntington Beach said the transition from football to 
wrestling was a demanding one physically and mentally. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, a nose guard who wrestles in the 191-pound class, separated his 
shoulder during football practice last fall. He reinjured it in a wrestling 
meet in mid-December and sat out three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Making the transition was a big deal," Cooper said. "There was a lot of 
pressure with football, and the break (in wrestling season) helps. The hunger 
starts to come back, but it's still hard to be out." 
</P>
<P>
Conditioning plays a big part in making the transition from sport to sport, 
coaches say. 
</P>
<P>
Henshall said his volleyball players came to basketball practice in good shape, 
but still had room to improve. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not too bad of a transition," he said. "I don't find too many problems. 
It's harder to go from a sport like basketball to track and field. 
</P>
<P>
"There you're going from an anaerobic sport to an aerobic sport, and from a 
team sport to an individual sport." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Reames, boys' basketball coach at Foothill, said football players make 
"much more aggressive basketball players than regular basketball players." 
</P>
<P>
"Physically, they're tougher," he said. "But conditioning-wise, they still need 
to get their basketball legs back." 
</P>
<P>
Wulf said most football players have trouble playing a full 32 minutes of 
basketball when they initially make the switch. 
</P>
<P>
"They're in long-term shape but not in basketball shape," Wulf said. "We ask 
them to go hard 30 or 40 seconds and then get a few seconds break. In football, 
it's just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
"You notice it especially if the player's a shooter. Tim's (Manning) shots all 
hit the front of the rim that first week he was back. His legs weren't in the 
type of shape to get high enough on his jump shot." 
</P>
<P>
Manning said: "You have to get in shape or your legs die really quick. 
Everything was moving in fast-forward ahead of me. I was confused trying to 
remember plays. You may look ready but still thinking, 'Yeah I've a long way to 
go.' " 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, volleyball players make the switch to basketball with few 
problems, rebounding notwithstanding, Henshall said. 
</P>
<P>
Henshall said the similarities between volleyball and basketball make the 
transition easier. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a conditioning program for basketball, but I would prefer they go out 
for volleyball," Henshall said. "They do a lot of jumping and lateral movement 
in volleyball and that really helps them (for basketball). And they're working 
on the timing of the ball coming to them. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps on defense too. (In volleyball) they're always helping out on 
defense, just like basketball. You get an assist in volleyball, just like 
basketball." 
</P>
<P>
The transition between sports can be a little confusing. At least Manning 
believes so. 
</P>
<P>
"By the San Dieguito tournament (mid-December), I felt more like a basketball 
player instead of a football player trying to play basketball," he said.

PACIFICA'S BASKETBALL TEAM GETS OFF TO A RUNNING START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Last fall, Pacifica High School Coach Rhett Heckel greeted 10 of his basketball 
players with quite a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a sixth-period basketball (conditioning) class and I made the following 
announcement to everyone: 'Congratulations, you're now on the cross-country 
team,' " Heckel said. 
</P>
<P>
Heckel had 10 of his 12 varsity players run cross-country last fall to prepare 
for the basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
Two other basketball players already were out for football, and Heckel wanted 
to get the rest of his team in condition. 
</P>
<P>
And running about five miles a day was a good start. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great," said Heckel, who is in his fourth year as Pacifica's basketball 
coach and his first as cross-country coach. "When basketball season started, we 
spent less time in practice working on conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally we're running sprints at the start of the season, but these guys 
already had a full season of cross-country behind them." 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners have had a tough start (2-), but the conditioning has proven to be 
an asset for leading scorers Randy Schulze (18 points) and Mike Maher (14). 
</P>
<P>
"Running gave us a sense of camaraderie," Heckel said. "We were all out there 
together every day. Cross-country wasn't much fun in practice, but the meets 
sure were." 
</P>
<P>
Heckel's starting backcourt turned in some surprising performances. Larry 
Nagata, a 5-foot-10 point guard, was the team's fourth-fastest runner and Anil 
Hanuman, a 6-2 guard, was fifth-fastest. 
</P>
<P>
"They came out and ran in their high-top (sneakers)," Heckel said. 
</P>
<P>
Heckel said he plans to make another announcement next fall. And once again, 
the Mariners will be running . . . and running . . . and running. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the biggest cross-country team in the (Garden Grove) league this year," 
he said. "We had 32 kids on the varsity while most other teams had eight or 10. 
We had to order bigger buses just to get to the meets." MIKE REILLEY

CMS ENHANCEMENTS PLANNING TO BUILD PLANT IN PAKISTAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While many U.S. high-tech companies are looking to Europe or the Pacific Rim as 
the hot spots for doing business overseas, CMS Enhancements President Jim 
Farooquee is casting a glance toward the Indian subcontinent. 
</P>
<P>
The Tustin computer company is completing plans to set up a manufacturing plant 
in Pakistan, Farooquee's native country. 
</P>
<P>
CMS officials say the company is negotiating a lease on a building and hopes to 
have a production line running early this year. 
</P>
<P>
Farooquee won't say exactly what CMS plans to manufacture in Pakistan, citing 
competitive reasons. But he says the operation will involve simple 
manufacturing assembly work. CMS is a supplier of computer disk drives, tape 
backup systems and other products for personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
CMS, which had sales of $200 million for the year ended June 30, doesn't 
actually manufacture most of its products. It primarily buys disk drives from 
other manufacturers, customizes them for certain PCs, then distributes them 
under the CMS brand name. 
</P>
<P>
The Tustin firm's only other manufacturing facility is in Singapore, where the 
company produces tape systems used to copy data stored on computer hard disk 
drives. 
</P>
<P>
Farooquee says his Pakistani heritage should be an advantage in doing business 
in that country. The CMS chief moved to the United States in 1976 after 
receiving a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from Karachi Technical 
College. 
</P>
<P>
He said many U.S. high technology firms have been reluctant to invest in 
Pakistan because, until the past few years, they have viewed the political 
situation as too unstable. 
</P>
<P>
One of Pakistan's attractions is low-cost labor. The average Pakistani worker 
earns just $30 per month, Farooquee says. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Pakistan is near the developing computer markets in three huge 
countries: India, China and the Soviet Union. And, Farooquee says, products 
manufactured in Pakistan could be transported to the European market cheaper 
than from the United States or the Far East. Compiled by David Olmos / Times

OFFICES, CONDOS AMONG O.C. PROPERTIES UP FOR SALE

<P>
A small office building in Orange built by a defunct thrift whose former owners 
now are convicted swindlers. A $4-million "windmill" nestled in Malibu's 
verdant Ramirez Canyon owned by a troubled Costa Mesa thrift. A $75-million 
hotel near Palm Springs that hosts world champion tennis. A sprawling 
equestrian center in Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
These properties are among scores in California that were built, acquired or 
repossessed by savings and loan associations that went under. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, they found their place on the first comprehensive list of real 
estate put on the auction block by the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal 
agency that is seeking to recover some of the scores of billions of dollars 
that S&amp;L failures will cost taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the roster of California properties is unassuming. A vacant auto park 
in Oxnard. Condominiums in central Los Angeles. Time-share vacation properties 
in Carlsbad and Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
But at least some of the pieces of real estate have acquired a degree of fame. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the former headquarters of the Ramona Savings &amp; Loan 
Assn. is a small, garden-style office building in the city of Orange. A modest 
8,000 square feet, it was built in 1981 by the then high-flying S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
But Ramona collapsed in 1986 after owners John L. Molinaro and Donald P. 
Mangano, in the words of one federal regulator, began using it as a "personal 
piggy bank." 
</P>
<P>
Molinaro was found guilty Oct. 5 on 33 counts of bank fraud, conspiracy and 
causing false information to be entered on Ramona's books. Mangano, 52, was 
convicted on 31 counts of bank fraud and conspiracy. Sentencing is scheduled 
for Monday in Los Angeles federal court. 
</P>
<P>
After Ramona's collapse, the building in Orange was acquired by Midwest Savings 
Assn. of Minneapolis. In February, 1989, after an expansion binge that saw it 
acquire two other failed thrifts in Iowa and Oklahoma, Midwest itself was 
declared in jeopardy and seized by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Other Orange County properties listed for sale are less glamorous: Lakeview 
Office Condos at 4676 Lakeview Ave. in Yorba Linda and Airport West Business 
Park at 245 Fischer Ave. in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
A more high-profile property with Orange County ties is for sale in Malibu. It 
is also one of the most expensive of thousands of single-family homes on the 
Resolution Trust list. 
</P>
<P>
The 19-room, windmill-shaped estate is tucked away in Ramirez Canyon, near 
property owned by singer and actress Barbra Streisand. One of the windmill's 
recent residents has identified himself as "Sir" John Fairchild, although 
reporters were unable to verify his claim to knighthood. 
</P>
<P>
According to real estate records, the owner of record is Pacific Savings and 
Loan Assn., the insolvent Costa Mesa thrift that was taken over by federal 
regulators last February. Pacific Savings was one of the first targets of the 
Bush Administration's effort to clean up the nation's troubled savings and loan 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift was acquired in October by Royal Trustco Ltd., a Canadian financial 
institution, with $550 million in federal assistance. The S&amp;L is now part 
of Pacific First Financial Corp., Royal Trustco's U.S. holding company based in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
But elsewhere in Southern California some high-brow real estate is on the 
block. The Hyatt Grand Champions Resort in Indian Wells, whose tennis courts 
have hosted the likes of Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg, is the site of the 
$700,000 Newsweek Champions Cup, which is played in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1986, the 336-room hotel is "awash with lagoons, swimming pools, 
fountains and waterfalls," according to at least one travel writer, and offers 
guests books in their bathrooms and robes in their closets. 
</P>
<P>
But Simi Valley-based Gibraltar Savings is now in "exclusive negotiations" to 
sell the resort to a buyer whom Richard Post, a Gibraltar senior vice 
president, declined to identify. Like many other troubled S&amp;Ls, Gibraltar 
has been taken over by federal regulators and its asset sales are being run by 
the RTC. 
</P>
<P>
The resort, which cost about $120 million to build and opened in 1986, is 87% 
owned by Gibraltar. The other stockholders are three insurance companies, Post 
said. Resolution Trust listed the property's current appraised value at $75 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Another financially troubled property is the Los Angeles Equestrian Center, 
built on land leased from the city of Los Angeles, and Gibraltar is involved in 
that deal as well. 
</P>
<P>
The $15-million center was an albatross around Gibraltar's neck for most of the 
1980s. The financial institution assumed ownership of the property through 
foreclosure in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1981 on 70 acres of property in Griffith Park, the center has lost 
more than $27 million and been controversial from the time it opened. At one 
time, the property's operators wanted to convert the rented horse stalls into 
condominiums, but the idea was turned down by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Gibraltar Savings has agreed to sell the center for an undisclosed amount to a 
group of private investors led by Gene Harmon, a semi-retired banker from 
Burbank. The sale still needs the approval of the Los Angeles Parks and 
Recreation Department. 
</P>
<P>
Another California property that may soon be disposed of is an 
18,000-square-foot commercial lot in Napa that is home to a historic Victorian 
structure. Its sale is expected to close by the end of the month, according to 
the agent who listed the property. 
</P>
<P>
At various times home to a bed and breakfast, a restaurant and a delicatessen, 
the property had been repossessed by Washington Savings &amp; Loan of Stockton. 
Washington Savings, in turn, was taken over by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The buyer, a Napa company, plans to convert the building into office space. But 
there has been one hitch. The former owner constructed his restaurant kitchen 
and a bathroom on neighboring property without seeking the benefit of an 
easement. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are in progress.

FIRMS DONATE TO RIGS-TO-REEFS FISH PROGRAM

Two energy companies have donated oil field equipment scraps for a program that 
transforms old pipe, rigs and platforms into fish habitats in the Gulf of 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Galveston County officials expect to begin construction early next year on a 
necklace of artificial fishing reefs using 1,000 feet of 10-inch pipe dug up 
from a products pipeline and donated by Conoco Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"To my knowledge, these are the first artificial reefs in the Galveston area, 
perhaps anywhere on the Gulf Coast, to be constructed for this specific 
purpose," said county Commissioner Eddie Barr. 
</P>
<P>
Conoco also has offered to deliver another 4,500 feet of 24-inch pipe to 
Galveston as soon as county workers are ready for it, Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-inch pipe was fabricated as tethers for Conoco's tension-leg well 
platform but became scrap when it was damaged during transport in rough seas. 
</P>
<P>
The pipe will be cut and welded into 20-by-20-by-15-foot structures and sunk at 
various sites off the Galveston shore. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate project, Transco Exploration Partners plans to sink a portion of 
an inactive production platform in the offshore High Island field early next 
year in deeper U.S. waters. 
</P>
<P>
Transco stopped production in the High Island field in 1988 and plans to move 
the rest of the platform. The state has received permission from the Corps of 
Engineers to establish reefs in that field. 
</P>
<P>
Since offshore oil exploration started in the late 1940s, it has been common 
knowledge that marine life cluster around drilling and production platforms to 
feed on tiny organisms clinging to the rigs. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks after rigs sink in the gulf, artificial reefs become crusted with 
marine organisms that attract many species of fish, including red snapper, 
amberjack, Spanish mackerel, kingfish and barracuda, said Tom Kessler, 
Galveston County assistant engineer. 
</P>
<P>
"Fish prefer lots of shaded nooks and crannies in which to school and feed on 
these organisms. These reefs will serve as good facilitators in the food chain 
cycle. They will provide more spawning ground for fish, which can then become a 
managed resource," Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
The oil industry views Texas' rigs-to-reefs program as a way to benefit the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we take petroleum from beneath the sea, it is only natural that we give 
something in return -- especially in our own back yard," said Bob Walker, vice 
president of Conoco's supply and transportation division. 
</P>
<P>
"Helping create a feeding ground for marine life is an excellent opportunity 
for everyone involved. A series of artificial reefs like this could produce 
important economic benefits for the tourism and fishing industries," Walker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Other cities use sunken ships, retired oil platforms and junked cars to attract 
marine life, Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
Barr said county officials are working to coordinate their efforts with the 
Texas Artificial Reefs Committee, which is drawing a map outlining the best 
spots for artificial reefs. 
</P>
<P>
County officials want to sink artificial reefs along a rocky ridge that runs 
parallel to the island where water depths range from 25 feet to 70 feet. Barr 
hopes that the reefs can be put close enough to the island for access by sport 
fishermen in power boats and scuba divers. 
</P>
<P>
County commissioners have applied for a $50,000 grant from the Moody Foundation 
to pay for construction and transportation of the first reefs, which are 
expected to be completed and sunk offshore in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
The Galveston Chamber of Commerce estimates charter fishing generates $2.25 
million annually that turns over three to five times in the local economy, 
yielding an economic impact of up to $11 million.

The New Year will bring the naming of a new music director of the Pacific 
Symphony, the usual impressive imports from the Orange County Philharmonic 
Society and a new production of Mozart's "Don Giovanni" by Opera Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
We may not see the Royal Ballet of Britain, however, which had announced a 
United States tour for July 2 through Aug. 5. The Metropolitan Opera, one of 
the original presenters, now says that the company is having trouble raising 
funds and the Met is no longer involved in the tour. The three-city tour was to 
have included stops in New York, Washington and Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, here are some music and dance picks for the new year. 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC 
</P>
<P>
*The Pacific Symphony's search for a new music director resumes on Jan. 31 and 
Feb. 1 when Boston Symphony assistant conductor Carl St. Clair will lead the 
orchestra in a program of works by Mozart, Tchaikovsky and Joseph Canteloube at 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair is the latest conductor in series of guest conductors that so far 
this season has included Lawrence Foster, Christopher Seaman, Stuart Challender 
and Toshiyuki Shimada. 
</P>
<P>
The contest continues on March 28 and 29 with Richard Buckley, former director 
of the Oakland Symphony, and on May 23 and 24, with Sergiu Comissiona, former 
New York City Opera conductor. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific's music adviser, Kazimierz Kord, who says that he is not a 
candidate, will conduct two pairs of concerts, on April 18 and 19 and on May 2 
and 3. 
</P>
<P>
Orchestra officials say that a decision will be announced this year. 
</P>
<P>
* The Philharmonic Society will sponsor a number of appearances at the Center, 
including Dennis Russell Davies conducting the Orchester der Beethovenhalle, 
Bonn, on March 30, Vladimir Ashkenazy conducting the Radio Symphony of West 
Berlin on May 6, and Yuri Temirkanov leading the Philadelphia Orchestra on May 
31. 
</P>
<P>
* The Garden Grove Symphony will be led by Philippe Bender, music director of 
the Orchestre Regional de Cannes, in a program of music by French composers on 
June 2. In a conductor-exchange program, Edward Peterson, music director of the 
Garden Grove Symphony, will first fly to Cannes, France on Feb. 18 to lead 
Bender's orchestra.

and San Francisco operas) of Puccini's "Turandot," Feb. 16 through March 2, and 
the company's own production of "Don Giovanni," Feb. 21 through March 3. 
(Unfortunately, "Turandot" will open on the same day as Verdi's "Falstaff" by 
the Los Angeles Music Center Opera.) 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa-based company will finish its season with Jerome Kern's classic 
musical "Show Boat" July 13 through 22 at the Center. 
</P>

KTLA GARNERS MOST VIEWERS FOR COVERAGE OF ROSE PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
While the usual mob of early-rising revelers lined the streets of Pasadena, the 
101st Tournament of Roses Parade was also being watched on television in more 
than 2 million Southern California homes. 
</P>
<P>
Between 8 and 10:30 a.m., 83% of all the TV sets that were in use in the Los 
Angeles market were tuned to one of the five stations that aired this year's 
assortment of floats, flowers, celebrities and marching bands. 
</P>
<P>
As in the past, KTLA Channel 5, with its team of Bob Eubanks and Stephanie 
Edwards and its promise of never leaving the parade for commercials, grabbed 
the bulk of the viewing audience. KTLA had 1.1 million households -- more than 
the other four stations combined. 
</P>
<P>
KTTV Channel 11 was a distant second with about 419,000 homes. The three 
network-owned stations, which broadcast the parade with repeated commercial 
breaks to the entire nation, were far behind in the local race. KCBS Channel 2 
attracted about 192,000 homes, while KNBC Channel 4 and KABC Channel 7 drew 
about 143,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
On the football front, with USC shooting for its first bowl win in five years, 
the Rose Bowl on KABC was far and away the most watched game of the day in Los 
Angeles. The Trojans' 17-10 victory over the University of Michigan garnered a 
23.1 local rating, meaning it was seen in more than 1.1 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
Other New Year's Day local Bowl ratings (with each point representing 49,315 
homes): 
</P>
<P>
* Orange Bowl: Notre Dame vs. Colorado, KNBC: 18.3. 
</P>
<P>
* Sugar Bowl: Miami vs. Alabama, KABC: 8.9. 
</P>
<P>
* Hall of Fame: Auburn vs. Ohio St., KNBC: 8. 
</P>
<P>
* Cotton Bowl: Tennessee vs. Arkansas, KCBS: 6. 
</P>
<P>
* Fiesta Bowl: Florida St. vs. Nebraska, KNBC: 4.5. 
</P>
<P>
* Citrus Bowl: Illinois vs. Virginia, KABC: 4.3.

NEVILLE BROS.' VIBRANCE, TALENT A SECRET NO LONGER; 
</P>
<P>
POP: AFTER YEARS, THE GROUP, WHICH PLAYS AT THE COACH HOUSE WEDNESDAY AND 
THURSDAY, FINDS COMMERCIAL SUCCESS ON "YELLOW MOON." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
For most of the 1980s, the Neville Brothers' story was bittersweet. 
</P>
<P>
The band's obvious excellence and originality brought it deep admiration among 
cultists and critics. But its failure to reach a mainstream audience was always 
a cause for sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
Stars like Linda Ronstadt, Keith Richards and Huey Lewis would sing the praises 
of the Nevilles, who play Wednesday and Thursday at the Coach House, and 
sometimes try to give them a boost with opening slots on their high-profile 
tours. Music publications would hail the band for fiery, socially conscious 
albums and performances that embodied the uniquely vibrant soul and R&amp;B 
tradition of the Nevilles' hometown, New Orleans. But always there would be 
that sad side to the tale: The Nevilles' excellence seemed destined to remain 
one of pop's proverbial best-kept secrets. 
</P>
<P>
Then came 1989 and the release of "Yellow Moon," the fifth album by the 
Nevilles since 1977, the year that brothers Art, Charles, Aaron and Cyril 
merged their previously separate musical careers to record as a family band. 
With all that good will built up from the past, and with producer Daniel Lanois 
lending the Nevilles' churning funk the atmospheric cast he had previously 
brought to hit albums by the likes of U2 and Robbie Robertson, "Yellow Moon" 
became the album that broke the Neville Brothers into the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
The accolades kept coming from the cognoscenti -- but there was no longer any 
need to temper admiration with sympathy about undeserved commercial neglect. 
</P>
<P>
"It really got us exposed to a lot of people who weren't aware of us," 
saxophonist Charles Neville said over the phone from San Francisco last week as 
he assessed the impact of "Yellow Moon." 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't quite get to gold (500,000 copies sold), but it got close. The last 
I heard, it was well over 300,000 and still selling. I think it was a 
combination of the album, and the publicity that went before it. Over the 
years, people have been hearing all these other people (like Richards and 
Ronstadt) talking about us. I think the combinations of all the things that 
went on in the '80s" led to the breakthrough with "Yellow Moon." While not a 
major hit by today's industry standards, the album's appearance on the 
Billboard Top 100 albums chart was still an achievement for a band that isn't 
naturally attuned to '80s pop formulas. 
</P>
<P>
According to Charles Neville, "Yellow Moon" may bring the Nevilles more good 
news: "The rumor we've heard is there's a good chance of it being nominated for 
Grammys in more than one category," he said. If so, the Nevilles would have a 
chance to enjoy a delicious reversal: Last year, they were the entertainment at 
the post-Grammy ceremony party for nominees. If the Grammy organizers have any 
sense at all, they will use the opportunity of a Neville Brothers nomination to 
have the band play on the national telecast. 
</P>
<P>
Other recent developments have placed the Neville name before the public even 
more. The band's rhythm section -- Cyril Neville on percussion, guitarist Brian 
Stoltz, bassist Tony Hall and drummer Willie Green -- was enlisted by producer 
Lanois to serve as the backing unit for Bob Dylan's "Oh Mercy" album. And Linda 
Ronstadt called on Aaron Neville and his sumptuous tenor for four duets on her 
new, million-selling album, "Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind." Neville 
receives special "featuring Aaron Neville" billing on the Ronstadt album's 
cover. The Nevilles will be the opening act for Ronstadt on her 1990 tour, 
Charles Neville said, with Aaron Neville doing double duty in duets with 
Ronstadt. 
</P>
<P>
According to Charles, there is no nervousness within the band over the fact 
that Aaron's distinctive voice lends itself to outside projects, not to mention 
a solo career. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something that's encouraged," said Charles, who, at 51, is a year 
younger than the eldest Neville, keyboards player Art. "I don't think it could 
hurt us at all for him to get as much notoriety as possible. (Aaron) is 
planning on doing a solo album. Hopefully, at some point we'll all be able to 
do that with enough recognition of the Neville Brothers name to have some 
instant clout behind whatever the solo project is." 
</P>
<P>
Among the outside projects is Art Neville's recent reunion with two other 
original members of the Meters, bassist George Porter and guitarist Leo 
Nocentelli. In the '60s and '70s, the Meters brought tight New Orleans funk to 
mass audiences as a backup studio band for Dr. John, Paul McCartney, Robert 
Palmer and Labelle. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Charles said, the Neville Brothers are working up songs for a 
follow-up to "Yellow Moon." The group will record at Lanois' studio in New 
Orleans, he said, but with a different producer -- the idea being not to 
retrace the sound Lanois crafted for the Nevilles on "Yellow Moon." 
</P>
<P>
This time the band will be building on success instead of wondering whether it 
will ever achieve a commercial breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Nevilles often talked of the need to come up with a hit during 
their years of small cult awareness (their 1987 album, "Uptown," was a blatant, 
but failed, attempt to gear songs to radio tastes), discouragement never set 
in, Charles said. 
</P>
<P>
"Things were always at a kind of slow-but-steady pace, getting better and 
better. We were selling out more places, getting bigger venues and a larger 
following. Our purpose was never that we were doing this to make a really great 
success. We're doing it because we love doing it." Then Charles chuckled. "If 
we get a couple of million sellers, that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
The Neville Brothers and Michael Anderson play Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m. 
at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $25. 
Information: (714) 496-8930.

Keyboardist Chick Corea has been selected best overall keyboardist in Keyboard 
magazine's 14th annual readers poll. The Los Angeles resident finished ahead of 
rockers Rick Wakeman and Keith Emerson and jazz/fusioneer Lyle Mays (of the Pat 
Metheny Group) in voting announced in the magazine's current issue. Corea also 
won the jazz piano and jazz keyboard categories and his GRP release "Akoustic 
Band" came in second in the best keyboard album category. 
</P>
<P>
Other winning jazz players included pianist Marcus Roberts, who won the best 
talent award, coming in ahead of Michel Camilo and Harry Connick Jr.

Singer Sarah Vaughan is recovering from a carcinoma in her right hand for which 
she has undergone treatment -- including radiation -- since May. According to a 
press release, the carcinoma has caused Vaughan to halt her heavy touring 
schedule for a while. She plans to resume in February. The vocalist appears on 
three cuts on Quincy Jones' new "Back on the Block" LP (Qwest) and plans to 
have Jones produce an LP for her in the forthcoming weeks.

Brooklyn saxophonist Steve Coleman, a well-known member of the avant-garde 
M-Base collective, has replaced bassist Dave Holland as artistic head of the 
Banff Jazz Workshop. The month-long July workshop in Banff, Canada, is a 
program focusing on individual creativity, improvisation and composition and is 
designed for post-graduate or professional-level players. 
</P>
<P>
This year's workshop will feature instruction from such modern jazz and 
contemporary American music stalwarts as pianist Muhal Richard Abrams, 
trumpeter Kenny Wheeler, drummer Marvin (Smitty) Smith and Holland. 
Applications by tape are due by March 1. Financial aid is available.

****"Dedication" (JMT) is the mellifluous, vigorous debut release from New 
York-based trombonists Steve Turre and Robin Eubanks, who appear with their 
quintet at the Vine Street Bar &amp; Grill in Hollywood tonight through 
Saturday. It's music that hints about mainstream jazz's future while heralding 
its past and spotlights two keen brass improvisers who have enchantingly rich 
tones. 
</P>
<P>
"Perpetual Groove" is one tune that blends the leaders' buttery sounds over 
synthesizer pads and a chunk-a-chunk rock-ish rhythmic feel, while "Red, Green 
and Black Blues," which is not a blues, recaptures the essence of '60s hard-bop 
but makes it come alive, not just exist as nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
On the latter, pianist Mulgrew Miller is happily funky, and the trombonists 
install mutes and softly coo behind bassist Charnett Moffett's solo. Turre's 
"Especially for You," a balmy ballad dedicated to the late trumpeter Woody 
Shaw, is a particular delight. 
</P>
<P>
****"Jenna" (Discovery), from Gerald Wilson's Orchestra of the '90s, leads us 
through big-band jazz from five decades, most composed by the 
leader/orchestrator, who wrote all the arrangements. This is an impressive 
collection that ranges from Eddie Durham's "Lunceford Special" and Wilson-Roger 
Segure's "Yarddog Mazurka," both recorded by Jimmie Lunceford in 1939 and 1941 
respectively, to the title track, a rousing modern work composed last year. As 
always, Wilson writes thickly-voiced, colorful orchestrations and provides 
backgrounds for soloists that both support and prod the improvisers. 
</P>
<P>
Included are such Wilson classics as "The Wailer," a bluesy shouter if ever 
there were one; "Carlos," a slow Latin work which shimmers with brass radiance, 
and his theme, "Blues for Yna Yna." Plenty of power-packed solos from top Los 
Angeles-based people like trumpeters Oscar Brashear, Snooky Young and Ron 
Barrows, reedmen Danny House, Randall Willis and Carl Randall, pianist Michael 
Cain and guitarist Anthony Wilson.

Fires in Simi Valley and Northridge overnight caused $100,000 damage each to 
two homes, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of arson is being investigated in the Northridge fire, which 
damaged a house and a garage in the 10800 block of Sylvia Avenue, Los Angeles 
Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt in the fire, which began shortly after 10:30 p.m. Tuesday and 
was extinguished 26 minutes later, Acevedo said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Simi Valley fire, nine residents escaped uninjured from the house in the 
700 block of Erringer Road even though the smoke detector was not working, 
Ventura County Fire Department spokeswoman Liz Pickles said. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six firefighters extinguished the 1:41 a.m. blaze in four minutes, 
Pickles said. The cause of that fire was being investigated, she said.

The government rushed more border troops to the southern republic of Azerbaijan 
today to try to stop a rampage by thousands of people along the boundary with 
Iran. 
</P>
<P>
One person was killed in a clash among the protesters, the official news agency 
Tass reported today. Border guards did not use their weapons and none were 
injured, it said. The report did not say how many protesters were injured. 
</P>
<P>
The government daily Izvestia said more than 4,000 people tore down guard 
towers and destroyed electronic alarms along the border. 
</P>
<P>
The rioters want southern Azerbaijan to be unified with northern Iran and have 
threatened to remove all barriers at the border unless authorities remove them, 
the newspaper reported. Azerbaijanis have said they merely want the right to 
freely visit friends and relatives on the other side of the border. 
</P>
<P>
Tass had said in the first report about the violence Tuesday that the rioters 
were "high on drugs or alcohol" and didn't mention political motives. 
</P>
<P>
Izvestia, in a report quoting I. Petrovas, head of the KGB's Caucasus border 
district, mentioned only the political motives and said protesters had been 
plotting the rampage for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Practically along the entire border between Azerbaijan and Iran a complex 
situation has emerged," Izvestia said. 
</P>
<P>
Izvestia said damage from the clashes exceeds $8.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The turmoil is the latest violence in the Caucasus, a region torn for two years 
by strife among Azerbaijanis, Armenians, Georgians and other ethnic groups. The 
sending of reinforcements showed that the elite KGB guards stationed along the 
border were incapable of ending the violence. 
</P>
<P>
The official news reports have not said how many border troop reinforcements 
were being sent, or how many are already in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Iran accused the Soviets of violating a border agreement, Izvestia said. 
</P>
<P>
Vagiv Samedoglu, editor of the Azerbaijan People's Front newspaper, called the 
Tass report of attacks by drunken, narcotics-influenced mobs a "lie" written in 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that Soviet Azerbaijanis had been camped along the border for 
nearly a month in hopes of seeing relatives and friends on the other side. The 
Azerbaijanis are the only Soviet ethnic group who, like Iranians, are largely 
Shiite Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
About 4 million ethnic Azerbaijanis live in the adjoining Iranian province 
alone. Their Soviet kin want an open border and the freedom to trade and cross 
the frontier, practices that were suspended by dictator Josef Stalin, Samedoglu 
said by telephone from Baku, Azerbaijan's capital. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian media monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus, had no immediate report on the 
rampage. But Tass reported that Iranian border commissioners issued a protest 
saying the "actions by extremist elements are insulting" to Iran and requesting 
the Soviets act to quell the disorders. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said "irresponsible elements" were trying to aggravate tensions in 
Azerbaijan and the Caucasus as a whole and provoke a brutal response from 
authorities. It did not elaborate.

Four police officers and at least three other men were injured today when a 
routine traffic stop in southwest Los Angeles turned into a brawl. 
</P>
<P>
Police speculated that the officers may have been intentionally ambushed. 
</P>
<P>
The melee erupted after patrol officers stopped a car for a routine traffic 
violation at 43rd Street and Crenshaw Boulevard shortly after 5 a.m., according 
to Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Bill Frio. "Suddenly, two cars, both 
with big loads of men, pulled in behind them," Frio said. "The suspects began 
to interfere with the officers and then surrounded them, taking a martial arts 
stance." 
</P>
<P>
At least three suspects were taken to the Los Angeles County-USC Medical 
Center. Eleven other suspects were being questioned.

Storms building up in the Atlantic threaten to break a crippled Iranian 
supertanker in two and release nearly 60 million gallons of crude oil into the 
sea off the Moroccan coast, official sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
The threatened disaster would be six times larger than the Exxon Valdez spill 
in Alaska last March and the sixth biggest ever in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The Amoco Cadiz, responsible for the fifth largest, dumped about 65 million 
gallons off France in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The weather here is expected to worsen in the next 24 hours, building a sea 
swell that would make floating booms useless in efforts to save Moroccan 
vacation beaches and fishing grounds from serious pollution. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 million gallons of oil have already poured from the listing 
284,632-ton Kharg-5 tanker, holed by fire and explosions 15 days ago, and 
crippled with jammed steering.

FIRST LADY GETS RADIATION TO HELP EYES

First Lady Barbara Bush, plagued by double vision and watery, bloodshot eyes 
from a thyroid condition, underwent new radiation treatment today at Walter 
Reed Army Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters after the First 
Lady returned from the hospital "she looks fine and said she feels fine." 
</P>
<P>
Anna Perez, the First Lady's press secretary, announced that doctors 
recommended the new treatment to relieve "persistent eye symptoms" from Graves' 
disease, a thyroid disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush went to the Washington area hospital at 6:30 a.m. today for the start 
of a 10-day daily out-patient radiation therapy, which will be applied for 10 
minutes in each treatment, Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
The First Lady has been suffering for a year from Graves' disease, first 
noticed around the time of her husband's inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
So far she has undergone two separate treatments, which have failed to heal her 
ailment. Several months ago she was given a radioactive treatment designed to 
destroy her thyroid gland. Afterward, daily doses of prednisone, a steroid, 
were administered to compensate for the thyroid. 
</P>
<P>
Perez said the new therapy will be applied to her orbits, the bony canals 
behind the eyes containing swollen muscles. "This swelling," Perez added, "has 
caused the double vision, tearing and discomfort, which Mrs. Bush is 
experiencing." 
</P>
<P>
She said the radiation treatment is expected to relieve the swelling. Mrs. Bush 
also is expected to be gradually taken off prednisone, which causes side 
effects such as water retention. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately following the destruction of the thyroid gland Mrs. Bush underwent 
a dramatic weight loss. Later, after taking prednisone, she began to look puffy 
and gained weight, and the symptoms persisted. 
</P>
<P>
Perez said Mrs. Bush, who has a heavy January schedule, will carry out her 
normal schedule.

President Bush, who has repeatedly pledged not to raise taxes, is likely to 
propose a levy on industry for the use of certain raw materials to encourage 
recycling, Administration sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is expected to be part of Bush's fiscal 1991 budget blueprint, 
which he will present to Congress on Jan. 29, said officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Bush pledged repeatedly in the 1988 campaign and again last year not to raise 
taxes. He said a few weeks ago in a year-end interview that he hoped to stick 
with that resolution. The sources said they considered a levy on raw materials 
for recycling more in the nature of a user fee than a tax. 
</P>
<P>
The aim of the proposal, reported by the Wall Street Journal in today's 
editions, would be to make it cheaper for industries to use recycled, rather 
than new, materials.

Former East German leader Erich Honecker may be moved to a monastery to protect 
him from a possible lynching by enraged citizens, a newspaper said today. 
</P>
<P>
In a front-page story, the mass-circulation Bild newspaper said "Lynch Danger 
-- Church Wants to Grant Honecker Asylum." 
</P>
<P>
Since Honecker was ousted Oct. 18, the former Communist Party leader and other 
party officials have been investigated on charges of corruption and living in 
luxury at the cost of the state. 
</P>
<P>
In December, seven former Politburo members were arrested, and Honecker was 
placed under house arrest in the government housing area of Wandlitz outside 
East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The Wandlitz homes, including the one in which Honecker still lives, are being 
converted to a medical rehabilitation center for children. Honecker is expected 
to be forced out of the compound in February.

David W. Johnson, chief executive officer of Michigan-based Gerber Products

companies announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Alfred A. Piergallini was elected chairman, president and chief 
executive of Gerber to succeed Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell began searching for a new chief executive long before R. Gordon 
McGovern, 63, announced his early retirement in November. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's appointment comes amid growing dissent among members of Campbell's 
founding family, who control about 59% of the company's common shares. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, three descendants of John T. Dorrance, who invented condensed soup 
in 1897, declared their desire to sell their 17% interest and push for a sale 
of the entire food-products company. On Tuesday, a second group of investors 
that also includes members of the Dorrance family said it will maintain control 
of its 2.5% stake and support efforts to keep Campbell independent.

MANSION OF DEBT-RIDDEN AUSTRALIAN MOGUL FOR SALE

A "For Sale" sign went up today outside Alan Bond's Sydney waterfront mansion 
as receivers took over at his Australian breweries. 
</P>
<P>
The latest evidence of acute financial strain for the embattled entrepreneur 
came as he continued a court battle to dislodge the receivers, fearing they 
could precipitate the collapse of his debt-laden business empire. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate agents estimate that the 40-room Gladswood House, once described by 
Bond's wife, Eileen, as her dream home, will fetch $8 million ($6 million U.S.) 
when it is auctioned next month. 
</P>
<P>
Bond's flagship Bond Corp. Holdings, which bought the house for $4 million ($3 
million U.S.) four years ago as a base for Bond employees visiting Sydney, said 
the auction is part of continuing asset sales aimed at reducing debt it puts at 
more than $6 billion ($4.5 billion U.S.) 
</P>
<P>
The court action to battle the appointment of receivers to the breweries was 
adjourned until Thursday after two days without resolution. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. investors were the latest group to lay a claim to the breweries today. 
Lawyers acting for U.S. noteholders told the Victorian Supreme Court hearing 
the dispute between Bond and the banks that they may wish to join the case. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Peter Hayes said he represented 21 investors, accounting for more than 
half of a $510-million U.S. note issue, who were interested in the legal 
action. He said he had been asked to tell the court of their interest and was 
awaiting further instructions from them. Hayes said the noteholders were 
unsecured lenders. 
</P>
<P>
Bond's Australian breweries had about $800 million of U.S. notes on issue as of 
June 30, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment of receiver-managers to the breweries was made at the 
instigation of a syndicate of banks, which is owed more than $700 million ($525 
million U.S.)

The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.42 at 2809.73 on heavy New York 
Stock Exchange volume of about 194 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
The industrial average gained 56.95 Tuesday to close above the 2,800-level for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Today, advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 6 to 5 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, with 878 up, 726 down and 395 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 192.33 million shares, against 162.07 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index lost .20 to 197.80. 
</P>
<P>
International Business Machines continued to build on its gains from Tuesday to 
close on the New York Stock Exchange up 3/4 at 98 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
The market's sharp rise Tuesday in the first session of the new year featured 
strength in many stocks that had fared poorly in the waning stages of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that resulted from a lifting of the pressure of year-end tax 
selling. 
</P>
<P>
As profit-taking halted the Dow's rally today, some investors also seemed 
reluctant to chase after stocks, given persistent worries about the outlook for 
the economy and corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
In the minds of many observers, stocks of many companies still represent a 
risky bet that business activity and earnings growth will begin to recover 
later this year from the slump that set in several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were sharply lower in early trading today after the government 
reported robust sales of new homes in November. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was down 7/16 point, or $4.38 per $1,000 
face amount, around midday. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, climbed to 
8.03% from 7.99% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that sales of new homes surged 9.6% in November, 
the steepest gain in four months. Analysts said the report threw water on 
recent talk of a real estate industry slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
Since long-term fixed-income investments such as bonds are considered a safe 
haven during periods of economic sluggishness, prices tend to decline following 
positive economic news. 
</P>
<P>
The government said new single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 710,000 units in November after edging up a revised 0.9% in 
October. Sales in October originally were reported to be off 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
"The strength of that number led people to believe that the real estate market 
is not as soft as the casual evidence might suggest," said Ray Stone, a 
managing director of Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a lot of to-do in the press in the last month about home prices 
falling," he said. "This would tend to dispel that notion to a degree." 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
were off 1/16 point to 7/32 point, intermediate maturities were down about 1/4 
point and long-term issues were 11/32 point lower, according to Telerate Inc., 
the financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, was down 2.44 to 1,185.33. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills issued Tuesday fell to 7.89% as the 
discount was unchanged at 7.64%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 7.94% from 
their level at auction as the discount gained 2 basis points to 7.54%. Yields 
on one-year bills were up to 7.82% as the discount gained 4 basis points to 
7.31%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8 3/8%, down from 8 1/2% late Tuesday.

The morning Bridgeport Telegram and afternoon Bridgeport Post will merge into a 
single morning paper later this year. 
</P>
<P>
The new paper will be called the Bridgeport Post, the newspapers' publisher, 
Dudley B. Thomas, announced. "The national trend is to morning newspapers, and 
our market is following suit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said there will be no reduction in editorial staff when the papers are 
merged. The newspapers have a combined daily circulation of about 80,000 and a 
Sunday circulation of more than 90,000. They are the largest owned by Thompson 
Newspapers Inc., which purchased them in 1988.

<TEXT>
<P>
A survey conducted by Orbit Video magazine of the decade's biggest box-office 
stars revealed a mildly surprising name as the era's most popular actor: 
Harrison Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's movies, according to the magazine's January survey, made $1.064 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Aykroyd, owing much to the two "Ghostbusters" movies and a brief appearance 
in "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom," was second with $871 million. Eddie 
Murphy was third with $828 million. Bill Murray's work generated ticket sales 
of $696 million for fourth place and Tom Cruise was fifth with $636 million. 
</P>
<P>
The top actress was Kim Basinger in 15th place overall with combined sales of 
$432 million.

Two youngsters got an eyeful of explicit sex when a videotape labeled 
"Cinderella" turned out to be hard-core porn, their parents say. 
</P>
<P>
Laura and David J. Burdick Sr. of Shelton filed suit in Superior Court on 
Tuesday against New Toys 'R' Us of Paramus, N.J., claiming the mix-up 
traumatized their children. 
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuit, the Burdicks bought the tape as a Christmas present 
for the children in 1987, popped it into their videocassette recorder and left 
the room. When they returned later, they found the youngsters glued to 
"Hollywood Confidential: Diary of a Sex Goddess," the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple claim their children, then 7 and 8, suffered emotional distress and 
loss of sleep and appetite. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit claims Toys 'R' Us was negligent in failing to inspect the tape and 
in failing to protect children from exposure to pornography. 
</P>
<P>
Angela Bourdon, a Toys 'R' Us spokeswoman, said today she could not comment on 
the lawsuit because the company had not yet received a copy. 
</P>
<P>
The best-known "Cinderella," the animated musical version of the fairy tale 
made by the Walt Disney studio was not released on videotape until 1988, a year 
after the alleged incident.

ACTION FILMS PUNCH UP TICKET SALES TO $5 BILLION IN N. AMERICA; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: SUMMERTIME MOVIEGOERS MADE UP FOR LACKLUSTER HOLIDAY SEASON IN RECORD 
BOX OFFICE YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
North America's movie theaters reaped a record $5 billion-plus at the box 
office in 1989, powered by the punch of "Batman" and other highly promoted 
action films. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a lackluster Christmas holiday season, summertime moviegoers spun the 
turnstiles at such a dizzying pace that the box office record of $4.45 billion 
from 1988 was smashed, according to figures released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The box-office total, based on industry estimates, was set by fewer films: 446 
features made their debuts in 1989, down 13% from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
In the studio-by-studio race, Warner Bros. was No. 1 with an estimated 17.1% 
share of all American and Canadian tickets sold. 
</P>
<P>
The studio's "Batman" was the year's biggest blockbuster. Its $251.2 million in 
ticket sales was fifth-highest in history. 
</P>
<P>
Disney, which some analysts did not expect to be competitive, finished fifth 
with a healthy 13.8% share. 
</P>
<P>
Although part of the revenue surge is attributable to higher ticket prices, 
admissions are projected to be greater than last year. 
</P>
<P>
In large part, the record year was propelled by expensive and heavily marketed 
star vehicles such as "Batman," and "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," which 
made $196 million, and "Lethal Weapon 2," which collected $147 million, 
according to trade publications and private research firms. 
</P>
<P>
Right behind, the lightly regarded "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" emerged as 1989's 
No. 4 film with receipts of $130 million. It was followed by the 1988 holdover 
"Rain Man" $127 million. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the year's top 10 are "Ghostbusters II," $112 million; "Look Who's 
Talking," $109 million; "Parenthood," $95 million; "Dead Poets Society," $94 
million, and "When Harry Met Sally . . . , " $91 million. 
</P>
<P>
Owing partly to cold weather and that Christmas fell on a Monday, this year's 
holiday season was off from a year ago. The scarce hits included "Back to the 
Future Part II" and "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation." 
</P>
<P>
The year's biggest flops include "Casualties of War," "Blaze," "We're No 
Angels," "Old Gringo," "Fat Man and Little Boy," "The Abyss" and just about 
every movie from the Orion studios: "She-Devil," "Valmont," "Great Balls of 
Fire," "Erik the Viking" and "Heart of Dixie."

More than 5.1 million visitors poured through the turnstiles at Universal 
Studios in 1989, shattering the 1987 record of 4.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Based on attendance, Universal Studios Hollywood has become the top tourist 
attraction in Los Angeles and the third largest in the United States, according 
to a studio spokesman. Park officials attribute the dramatic upturn to the 
March debut of Earthquake, a man-made attraction that recreates "The Big One" 
-- an 8.3 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
"Earthquake -- The Big One is the most successful new attraction debut in theme 
park history," said Ron Bension, president of Universal Studios Hollywood. "No 
other major theme park has ever reported these kinds of attendance increases."

FIFTEEN MILLION copies of Dale Carnegie's "How To Make Friends and Influence 
People" have been printed since it was first published in the early 1940s. It 
has been called the world's most popular self-help book. Now, Shad Helmstetter, 
author of the best-selling "What to Say When You Talk to Yourself" and his 
current "Choices," is being groomed as the new self-help superstar. 
Helmstetter's publishers, Pocket Books, feel he's got the golden Dale Carnegie 
touch. They have just signed the author to a juicy four book contract, assuring 
that he will indeed be "the Dale Carnegie of the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
BRUCE WILLIS certainly isn't letting any grass grow under his feet -- only 
money. After filming "Die Hard II," the sequel to the smash hit which made him 
a multimillion-dollar movie star, Bruce pairs with Isabella Rossellini in 
Europe for a movie. It will be a thriller entitled "Hudson Hawk." 
</P>
<P>
SO YOU think movie people can't see any further than the end of a camera lens? 
Then consider this. Actor John Malkovich, director Bernardo Bertolucci and 
Bertolucci's wife, Claire Peploe, flew from the set of "Sheltering Sky" in 
Morocco, to Prague, just to witness a little bit of history as Vaclav Havel was 
installed as president. 
</P>
<P>
THE ROYAL Shakespeare Company's artistic director, Terry Hands, has been asked 
to consider adapting the great MGM musical "An American in Paris" for the 
stage. "An American in Paris" won the Best Picture Oscar in 1951 and is 
considered the apex of MGM's musical genre and of Gene Kelly's career. 
</P>
<P>
SPEAKING OF Americans in Paris, can you guess who the biggest celebrity is in 
The City of Light right now? It's the enduring Raymond Burr, over there to 
shoot a new Perry Mason TV movie for NBC. All the Parisians know him, and 
shouts of "Perreee!!" follow him everywhere. And this was a guy who started out 
back in 1946 playing unsavory types in B movies like "San Quentin" and "Gorilla 
at Large." 
</P>
<P>
ON MARCH 25, one of the most eagerly awaited theatrical events of the season, 
of the year, perhaps, will happen. That is the opening night for Peter 
Shaffer's "Lettice and Lovage" which will return the incomparable Maggie Smith 
to Broadway after an absence of 10 years. The two-time Oscar winner will 
re-create her highly praised London performance as Lettice Douffet. Her 
co-star, Margaret Tyzack, also comes from the acclaimed British run. Maggie 
Smith, by the way, was recently knighted, and so is now, officially, a great 
Dame. 
</P>
<P>
DON'T CRY for Ed Koch, the former mayor of New York. Koch's canny attorney, 
Allen G. Schwartz, has negotiated contracts for Ed that will guarantee him a 
minimum income of more than $1 million a year for several years to come. This 
includes revenues from radio, TV, newspaper columns, lectures and appearances 
in TV commercials. But now wait, before you all get nasty, Ed Koch will NOT 
receive any income from his forthcoming book of arguments from Simon &amp; 
Schuster. Since he wrote it on city time, he has contributed the $100,000 
advance and all royalties to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
TYRONE POWER, the great movie star and matinee idol of Hollywood's golden era, 
has been dead 31 years. But his fan club, founded in 1947, still functions. 
Many of the members are from the original group of teen-age bobby soxers who 
started it all. So, Elvis Presley's fans still have a way to go matching this 
devotion!

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: MEDICATION COULD BE THE KEY TO IMPOTENCE PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GRAEDON and DR. TERESA GRAEDON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: My husband has had a problem with impotence for years, but we got by 
somehow. Now he is not interested at all. He doesn't even come near me and 
yells if I approach him. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a medicine or a vitamin or anything that can bring him to life? I 
don't want to give up sex yet. We are in our 50s. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You shouldn't have to give up sex in your 50s. First, your husband 
needs to have his doctor check his medications to make sure one of them isn't 
to blame. A surprising number of drugs can cause impotence or lower sex drive. 
</P>
<P>
Next, a urologist may be able to tell if there is a biological problem. There 
are now several prescription medications that may actually help restore 
erections, including yohimbine or papaverine injections. Surgery is even 
possible in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, psychological or marital counseling can provide the kind of support he 
needs to maintain a more loving relationship with you. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You recently suggested the FDA approve 12-minute strep tests for home use. 
As a pediatrician, I question your understanding of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
All of the quick strep tests on the market are inaccurate compared to a 24-hour 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
An inaccurate, negative 12-minute strep test done at home could give a false 
sense of security and should never replace evaluation of the child's other 
symptoms, or the parent's intuition -- which I have found very reliable. 
</P>
<P>
A. You are right -- the quick strep test is not perfect. If it indicates a 
strep throat, our consultants assure us that is highly reliable and deserves 
immediate antibiotic treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The problem arises when the test shows no strep. About one in 10 of those are 
"false negatives." These children actually have strep which can be cultured in 
24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
If every sore throat were seen by a doctor, we wouldn't advocate home testing. 
But many children don't get their throats cultured and home testing might 
assist parents in making better decisions. A positive quick strep test would 
allow the doctor to call a prescription in. Unfortunately, a negative test 
would probably still require a follow-up visit to the doctor.

More than $19,000 in back taxes are owed the federal government by the former 
owner and former general manager of the defunct Wyoming Wildcatters of the 
Continental Basketball Assn., according to the government. 
</P>
<P>
A lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court here claims that former owner John 
O'Donnell of Corona del Mar, and former General Manager Jeffrey Gordon, now 
living in Nevada, are responsible for $19,428.58 in unpaid withholding taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government alleges that the unpaid taxes date to the fourth quarter 
of 1987 and the first quarter of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell and Gordon were notified of the unpaid taxes in October, 1988, 
according to the lawsuit.

SEATTLE OWNER HELPS TEEN-AGER WITH CANCER

A co-owner of the Seattle Mariners flew an Indianapolis teen-ager to Seattle 
for cancer treatment today. 
</P>
<P>
Businessman Jeff Smulyan offered a ride in his Learjet to 16-year-old Shaun 
O'Neal, his mother and his sister after learning Tuesday of the teen-ager's 
need to travel to Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal is to undergo a bone marrow transplant from his sister, Nicole, 21. 
</P>
<P>
Smulyan, who owns the Indianapolis-based Emmis Broadcasting, has been traveling 
to Seattle frequently since he and Indianapolis developer Michael Browning 
became the majority owners of the American League team last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"It was his idea," Robin Rene of Emmis said about her boss's offer. "He 
commutes to Seattle quite a bit since he still lives in Indianapolis and 
thought why not invite the O'Neals along. 
</P>
<P>
"Robin called and said her boss had read about Shaun and would we be interested 
in a ride," said Burma O'Neal, the boy's mother. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager's condition was diagnosed as leukemia in September, 1987, and he 
is about to have his second marrow transplant from his sister. 
</P>
<P>
The process will begin within the next 30 days and the procedure takes between 
four and six months, Burma O'Neal said.

ROBITAILLE, GRETZKY TOP ALL-STARS

Los Angeles' Luc Robitaille outpolled his more famous teammate, Wayne Gretzky, 
for the second consecutive year to lead all vote-getters today in balloting for 
the Campbell Conference starting team in the 41st NHL All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille, a left wing who leads the Kings with 31 goals, received 298,914 
votes in fan balloting for the Jan. 21 game at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena. His 
vote total was more than three times the number received by runner-up Gerard 
Gallant of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty happy. It's always a surprise," Robitaille said. "I guess I picked 
the right position as a kid, left wing. It's always fun to be there." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, who broke Gordie Howe's career scoring record earlier this season and 
leads the NHL in scoring, had 276,980 votes, more than twice as many as 
Detroit's Steve Yzerman. 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille and Gretzky were joined on the starting team by two members of the 
defending Stanley Cup champion Calgary Flames, goaltender Mike Vernon and 
defenseman Al MacInnis, as well as right wing Brett Hull of St. Louis and 
defenseman Kevin Lowe of Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon received 216,448 votes, beating out Edmonton's Grant Fuhr to earn his 
first All-Star start. MacInnis, last spring's playoff MVP, led all defensemen 
with 218,000 votes, followed by Lowe, one of eight Oilers on the ballot, with 
187,091. Steve Duchesne of the Kings was third, less than 5,300 votes behind 
Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky was happy for Lowe, his long-time teammate with the Oilers, and 
Robitaille, a teammate since the trade that sent Gretzky to Los Angeles in 
August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Kevin works hard every game and comes to win every game. It's great to see the 
fans recognize his contributions," Gretzky said. "Luc is having a great year, 
31 goals. What else do you need to say?" 
</P>
<P>
Of his own selection, Gretzky said, "It's nice of the fans. I just come out to 
play every night. All-Star games are fun." 
</P>
<P>
Hull, son of Hall of Famer Bobby Hull, has 35 goals, tying him with Pat 
LaFontaine for the league lead. He was tops among right wings with 248,024 
votes, edging Edmonton's Jari Kurri, who got 230,565. Kurri became the 25th 
player in NHL history to reach 1,000 career points when he had a goal and two 
assists in a 6-4 victory over Hull and the Blues Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Wales Conference starters, announced Tuesday, include Pittsburgh center 
Mario Lemieux and defenseman Paul Coffey, Boston defenseman Ray Bourque and 
right wing Cam Neely, Montreal goaltender Patrick Roy and Philadelphia left 
wing Brian Propp. 
</P>
<P>
Wales Coach Pat Burns of Montreal and Campbell Coach Terry Crisp of Calgary 
will select the rest of the 20-man rosters. Each of the 21 NHL teams must have 
at least one representative.

Snowfall and bitterly cold weather contributed to declines in attendance and 
betting totals during Turfway Park's 23-day holiday racing schedule in 
December, race track officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Daily average attendance at the northern Kentucky thoroughbred track was 7,337, 
down by 25.2% from the 9,183 average of the holiday meet a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The average handle was $1.18 million, a 23.6% decline from $1.45 million during 
the 1988 holiday meet, Turfway officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Two snowstorms and severe cold weather prompted seven days of cancellations at 
Turfway last month. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 1989 holiday meet, Turfway had experienced increases in daily 
average attendance and handle for 10 consecutive race meets from fall, 1986, 
through the fall, 1988, meet, track spokesman Richard Eng said. 
</P>
<P>
Turfway began its 1990 winter-spring racing schedule today by resuming a 
five-day schedule Wednesdays through Sundays. The meet continues through April 
5 with its feature race, the Jim Beam Stakes, scheduled March 31.

BRONCOS GIVE COLORADO COUNSEL OF EXPERIENCE

The Broncos, who have some idea of what it feels like to lose a championship 
football game, are offering some advice to the University of Colorado 
Buffaloes, who Monday lost the Orange Bowl and their claim to the national 
college football title. 
</P>
<P>
"Keep your heads up," said Broncos running back Steve Sewell. And tight end 
Orson Mobley said the Buffs should "keep a winning attitude. Set your goals a 
little higher and try to achieve them." 
</P>
<P>
The Buffs were ranked No. 1 in the nation before Monday night's 21-6 loss to 
Notre Dame. They finished the season ranked No. 4 in the nation; Notre Dame 
finished No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The game could have handed the Buffs, 11-0 and the only undefeated major 
college team going into the game, their first-ever national championship. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos lost consecutive Super Bowls in 1987 and 1988, and the NFL team 
players and coaches said they saw a little of themselves in the Buffs' game 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like a couple of games we had played," Broncos Coach Dan Reeves 
said. "You have a chance to do something in the first half, then you don't take 
advantage of opportunities and it comes back to hurt you." 
</P>
<P>
Mobley recalled missing some chances and regretting it. 
</P>
<P>
"It reminded me a little of our game against the (New York) Giants. The first 
half belonged to us, but we missed some key scoring opportunities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sewell said he also knows what it is like. "It's a big letdown. But the younger 
guys have a chance to come back. Now they know what it's like to win, and that 
should give them some incentive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos agreed that the Buffs easily could be in a national title game 
again next year if they do not let Monday's loss affect them too much. 
</P>
<P>
And that is not likely to happen, the Broncos agreed. 
</P>
<P>
'They showed a lot of heart and a lot of class. That stands tall when all is 
said and done," said Broncos quarterback Gary Kubiak.
