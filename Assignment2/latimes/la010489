RIGHTS TALKS IN MOSCOW GET REAGAN'S OK

President Reagan has approved U.S. participation in a controversial 
international conference on human rights to be held in Moscow in 1991, thus 
eliminating the last major roadblock to a new set of East-West arms 
negotiations, Administration officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's decision came at the recommendation of Secretary of State George P. 
Shultz, who is expected to take part later this month in issuing an East-West 
declaration in Vienna authorizing the Moscow conference and proclaiming an 
enhanced list of internationally accepted freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. agreement to hold a human rights conference in the Soviet capital would 
represent the Reagan Administration's strongest endorsement yet of Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's internal reforms. Some human rights groups 
strongly disapprove of U.S. participation. 
</P>
<P>
Approval of the Vienna declaration by the 35 nations that have been working on 
it for two years is expected to lead to convening much-awaited East-West 
negotiations early this year on phased reductions of the massive armies that 
have faced each other in Europe since the onset of the Cold War four decades 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said President-elect George Bush and his designated 
secretary of state and national security adviser, James A. Baker III and Brent 
Scowcroft, were consulted in advance. Reagan's decision is scheduled to be 
announced by the White House in Los Angeles this morning. 
</P>
<P>
An official said that Bush was consulted at "every step in the process" and is 
fully behind the decision, which includes conditions on Soviet conduct that 
would allow the new President to reverse course before 1991 if the Soviets 
backtrack. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DeConcini Declined 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), co-chairman of the U.S. Commission on Security 
and Cooperation in Europe, said through a spokesman that Shultz telephoned him 
Tuesday seeking his concurrence with the decision to approve the Moscow 
conference but that he declined. DeConcini's view is that about 80 more 
long-term refuseniks who have been seeking to emigrate from the Soviet Union 
should be allowed to leave before the United States accepts the Moscow 
conference, his spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
A number of U.S. human rights groups are also expected to protest the 
Administration's position, on grounds that the Soviets should be required to 
take additional actions on outstanding human rights cases before the West 
agrees to participate in the Moscow conference. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department, in a statement read Friday by spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, 
set the stage for Shultz's recommendation and Reagan's decision by declaring 
that "the Soviet Union has taken a number of significant, positive actions on 
human rights in recent months." 
</P>
<P>
Oakley mentioned the release of more than 600 political prisoners in the past 
two years, including all Helsinki-process human rights "monitors" who were 
being held and "all prisoners known to us who were charged under political or 
religious articles of the Soviet criminal code." 
</P>
<P>
She also cited the settlement of all but about a dozen U.S.-Soviet 
family-reunification cases, a sharp increase in Jewish, Armenian, German and 
Pentecostal emigration from the Soviet Union, permission for many long-term 
refuseniks to emigrate, cessation of Soviet and Eastern European jamming of 
Western radio broadcasts and commitments by Gorbachev to make extensive changes 
in Soviet laws and regulations on human rights. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Conditions 
</P>
<P>
Just such Soviet moves were listed by Shultz in an early November letter to 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze setting out U.S. conditions for 
participation in the Moscow conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Shultz letter had the general approval of the British and Canadian 
governments, which had been nearly as reluctant as Washington to send diplomats 
to a rights meeting held by the Soviets in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze proposed a Moscow conference on human rights in his opening 
statement to the Vienna negotiations two years ago. And in recent months the 
Soviets emphasized the demand for such a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Besides providing international recognition to its recent steps to improve 
human rights at home, conditional Western approval of such a conference could 
be used by Gorbachev as a lever for further reforms in his internal maneuvering 
with Communist Party conservatives and police agencies, according to U.S. and 
some Soviet officials. 
</P>
<P>
In Vienna on Tuesday, nine neutral or nonaligned nations presented a nearly 
complete draft of the declaration proposed to be proclaimed by Shultz, 
Shevardnadze and others in Jan. 17-19 ceremonies winding up the Vienna 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, a follow-up meeting on the 
1975 Helsinki accords. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. sources said the draft calls for greatly enhanced freedoms for Soviet Bloc 
citizens to travel; emigrate; circulate and receive information; practice 
religion, and reunite with relatives in the West.

NAVY OFFICIAL WAS PAID FOR BID HELP, COURT PAPERS SAY

A Navy purchasing official received regular payments from consultants working 
on behalf of a major defense contractor in exchange for his aid in bidding on a 
$16-million contract for Navy electronic equipment, prosecutors charged in 
court documents unsealed Tuesday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The documents, part of the massive defense procurement fraud investigation 
disclosed last spring, provide the most detailed picture so far of the active 
role that federal investigators believe a government official played in at 
least one facet of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy official, Stuart E. Berlin, allegedly not only provided crucial 
"inside information" to a consultant hired by Hazeltine Corp., which was 
seeking the contract, but worked within the Navy to try to limit competition 
from other companies bidding on the project. 
</P>
<P>
In return, Alexandria, Va., consultant William L. Parkin and an associate, Fred 
H. Lackner of Woodland Hills, Calif., periodically made $1,000 cash payments to 
Berlin, according to a search warrant affidavit prepared by federal prosecutors 
last June. 
</P>
<P>
Allegations of payoffs for confidential data are at the heart of the federal 
investigation into military weapons-buying that first surfaced last June, when 
federal agents searched the homes and offices of more than 40 Pentagon 
officials, defense industry consultants and military contractors. 
</P>
<P>
The searches capped a two-year inquiry into alleged fraud, bribery and 
influence peddling in the $150-billion-a-year military procurement system. Law 
enforcement officials have described the investigation as the broadest inquiry 
ever into corruption in military purchasing. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation, directed by Henry E. Hudson, U.S. attorney for the Eastern 
District of Virginia, is expected to yield its first indictments soon, perhaps 
as early as Friday. The Hazeltine firm, Parkin, Lackner and Berlin are among 
the subjects of the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the investigation, the case is being built in 
stages, with relatively minor players being pursued first in hopes that they 
will provide information on higher-ups, including former Assistant Navy 
Secretary Melvyn R. Paisley, one of the prime targets of the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Top Probe Targets 
</P>
<P>
High-powered industry consultants William M. Galvin and Charles F. Gardner are 
also known to be among the prosecutors' top targets. Investigators say that 
they are suspected of using their contacts inside the Pentagon to illegally 
help their numerous corporate clients obtain Defense Department business. 
</P>
<P>
The court document unsealed Tuesday provided the prosecutors' justification for 
searching the office of Joe Colarusso, a Hazeltine senior vice president 
working from the firm's Greenlawn, N.Y., facility. The allegations are based 
largely on conversations recorded from a tap on Parkin's telephone. 
</P>
<P>
The warrant details Hazeltine's efforts in 1987 and 1988 to obtain a 
$16-million contract for a device to test Navy radar systems, a move that 
collapsed after the federal investigation was disclosed last summer. It 
includes also allegations about Hazeltine's attempts to obtain two other 
multimillion-dollar Navy electronics contracts. 
</P>
<P>
On the radar systems contract, the affidavit alleges, Hazeltine was on the 
brink of being eliminated until Berlin interceded on its behalf with his 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Hazeltine is a subsidiary of St. Louis-based Emerson Electric Co., which in 
1987 did $366-million worth of business with the Defense Department, making it 
the nation's 43rd-largest defense contractor. 
</P>
<P>
A Hazeltine spokesman said in a prepared statement Tuesday: "Hazeltine 
continues to cooperate fully with authorities and has no further comment at 
this time." The firm earlier acknowledged that it was a target of the 
government investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Colarusso and Hazeltine's Washington marketing representative, Charles 
Furciniti, hired Parkin to obtain information from the Navy about its 
procurement plans, for which the firm agreed to pay Parkin $2,000 a month, 
according to the warrant. 
</P>
<P>
Parkin turned to his friend Lackner, who had a long relationship with Berlin, 
head of the ship systems engineering branch of Naval Air Systems, investigators 
said in the court document. 
</P>
<P>
"Lackner once told Parkin that the information Berlin provided was information 
that the company could not obtain on its own," the affidavit states. 
</P>
<P>
The warrant says that Parkin agreed to split his $2,000 monthly fee with 
Lackner for any relevant information Lackner could glean from Berlin to help 
Hazeltine obtain Navy business. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, apparently every few months, Parkin and Lackner each contributed $500 
cash and Lackner paid that to Berlin," the document states. "Lackner told 
Parkin that the payments were made, and FBI surveillance once observed Lackner 
meet Berlin when a payment was scheduled to be made." 
</P>
<P>
Berlin's lawyer, Jeffrey Harris, could not be reached for comment Tuesday. But, 
in an earlier interview, he said that the government case is built wholly on 
circumstantial evidence and that Berlin never took payments from defense 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Payments Denied 
</P>
<P>
William Dougherty, Lackner's attorney, when asked whether his client had paid 
Berlin for confidential Navy data, said: "No way. No. No. No." 
</P>
<P>
Dougherty acknowledged that Lackner may be indicted. "It wouldn't surprise me, 
but it doesn't mean they have any evidence," he said in an interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The government warrant alleges that Parkin and Lackner discussed additional 
payments that they could expect from Hazeltine if the company received the Navy 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
"Parkin mentioned the amounts of $30,000 and $50,000 in that regard," according 
to the warrant. 
</P>
<P>
Gerard F. Treanor, Parkin's attorney, said that the government has "grossly 
overstated" Parkin's role. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's see if the assumptions and suppositions the FBI agent makes (in his 
affidavit) stand up in front of a jury . . . . We anticipate his being indicted 
and I anticipate his being acquitted," Treanor said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hot' Information 
</P>
<P>
According to the affidavit, the two consultants operated in secrecy, with 
Lackner once traveling across the country to meet face to face with Parkin 
because the information gleaned from his Pentagon source was "so 'hot' they did 
not want to pass it on the telephone," the court document alleges. 
</P>
<P>
According to the picture painted by the affidavit, Berlin served from his 
Pentagon office as the vital source in an information pipeline, providing to 
Lackner -- in return for bribes from him -- the inside guidance that eventually 
enabled Hazeltine to design its bid to fit the Navy's specifications precisely. 
</P>
<P>
Under the arrangement worked out between the two consultants, the document 
alleges, the information was then passed from Lackner to Parkin, who shared it 
in turn with his clients at Hazeltine. 
</P>
<P>
The document alleges that Hazeltine representatives were culpable as well, and 
it cites a wiretapped conversation in which Colarusso, the Hazeltine vice 
president, asks Parkin whether Berlin was being "looked after." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leak of Budget Claimed 
</P>
<P>
While Hazeltine was preparing to bid on the electronics contract for the 
UPM-150 system in February, 1987, according to the document, it was able to 
learn from Parkin exactly how much money would be budgeted by the government 
for the project and the estimated quantities that the government planned to 
buy. 
</P>
<P>
Hazeltine was also able to communicate its preferences to Berlin as well, the 
document says. 
</P>
<P>
After becoming concerned in the spring of 1987 that the bidding competition 
might be widened to include companies other than itself and Gould Inc., its 
Illinois-based chief rival for the project, Hazeltine told Parkin that it would 
prefer to have only one competitor. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, it said, Lackner reported that Berlin was seeking to persuade his 
Navy colleagues to agree to the limit. When the Navy was trying to decide how 
to weigh the two proposals that fall, Colarusso transmitted Hazeltine's 
preferences. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the affidavit suggests, Berlin became both an advocate and a 
strategic adviser for Hazeltine, communicating -- through Lackner and Parkin -- 
his advice on the company's bidding strategy. 
</P>
<P>
His help proved crucial, the affidavit says, when Hazeltine submitted a bid far 
more costly and less sophisticated than its competitor's. After meeting with 
Berlin, Lackner told Parkin that "Berlin had a tough time saving Hazeltine" 
from being eliminated by Pentagon officials from the competition.

$97-MILLION SETTLEMENT OVER MALIBU LANDSLIDE; 
</P>
<P>
AGREEMENT REQUIRES COUNTY, CALTRANS, INSURERS TO PAY HOMEOWNERS FOR BIG ROCK 
MESA DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys for Los Angeles County, the California Department of Transportation, 
dozens of insurance companies and the attorneys representing 240 Malibu 
hillside homeowners reached a tentative settlement Tuesday that will pay the 
property owners $97 million for damage they suffered during a massive 1983 
landslide. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement was reached after 4 1/2 years of litigation over who was 
responsible for the damage from the Big Rock Mesa landslide, one of the worst 
in state history, in which 250 Malibu homes collapsed, cracked or slid off 
their foundations. Under the agreement, Los Angeles County will pay $35 million 
to the Malibu homeowners, Caltrans will pay $40 million and the insurance 
companies will contribute the remaining $22 million. The money will be paid 
over a three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
About $200,000 Apiece 
</P>
<P>
After lawyers' fees are paid from the settlement, the homeowners will receive 
about $200,000 apiece, according to the attorneys for the Malibu residents. 
Sixteen homeowners who declined to be part of the settlement are trying to 
reach a separate agreement. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the settlement, none of the parties is to admit responsibility 
for the landslide and the homeowners agree to drop future claims against the 
county, the state and the insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement will erase the need for a massive trial, with most of the 240 
homeowners as plaintiffs, that had been scheduled in Los Angeles next month. A 
special courtroom three times larger than any other in the United States was to 
have been built for that trial. It also will cancel a separate trial involving 
seven other Big Rock Mesa homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
"We're satisfied that this was the best agreement we could get," homeowners' 
attorney Ken Chiate said after the settlement was announced by Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge Robert I. Weil. "The vast majority of the homeowners 
wanted out. It's been a long five years. No matter how much money we got, 
there's no way it could pay for the damage some of them suffered." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Edelman, chairman of the Board of Supervisors, announced the county's part 
of the settlement in the board's chambers after a closed session Tuesday 
afternoon. The county, which has spent more than $7 million defending the case 
and had been expected to spend $13 million more in the massive trial, had been 
the main recent stumbling block to a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"This settlement will avoid enormous litigation costs for all parties, remove a 
continuing burden from the court calendar and uncertainty from the county 
budget," Edelman said. "It is also fair to the homeowners." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the Big Rock homeowners agreed, however. Actor Pernell Roberts said 
the settlement does not punish the parties who were responsible for the 
landslide. 
</P>
<P>
"We will never have an opportunity to get at the real heart of the crime," he 
said. "This was a tragic situation where many people will never come close to 
being fully compensated for their loss and the people responsible for what 
happened will continue to make bad judgments involving innocent people. 
</P>
<P>
"What this case shows is that the judicial system is not equipped to handle 
events of this magnitude." 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners had sued the county and the state for more than $200 million in 
damages for approving development of the Big Rock Mesa area above Pacific Coast 
Highway with seepage pits and horizontal drains rather than with sewers. They 
claimed that the county's action contributed to a rise in ground water that 
triggered the September, 1983, landslide on Big Rock Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The slide caused some homes to collapse, cracked walls, floors, driveways, 
tennis courts and the winding roads in the expensive neighborhood. About 30 
homes were condemned by the county as unsafe and the value of the others, many 
priced at more than $1 million, plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
The county filed more than 300 countersuits against past and present 
homeowners, arguing that they were to blame for the disaster because they did 
not drain water from the mesa and contributed to the slide by using septic 
tanks, showers and toilets and refused to allow the county to build sewers 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans agreed last year to pay $25 million to the homeowners to settle the 
lawsuits after the state was found liable by a Superior Court jury of 
contributing to the landslide by cutting through the hillside to build Pacific 
Coast Highway. Under Tuesday's agreement, Caltrans will pay an additional $15 
million. Those funds must still be approved by the Legislature and Gov. George 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
The $35-million county portion of the agreement is the same settlement figure 
suggested early last year by Chiate and Richard Norton, the homeowners' chief 
attorneys, and rejected by the the county's lawyers. The county had suffered a 
series of legal setbacks in the Big Rock litigation recently, however, and gave 
indications last week that it would settle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suits Separated 
</P>
<P>
The state Supreme Court ruled last year that a case won by the county against 
one Big Rock Mesa homeowner was not binding on the rest of the lawsuits. An 
attempt by the county to have the case dismissed was rebuffed by Superior Court 
Judge Maurice Hogan Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Still, until last week, attorneys for the homeowners and the county were unable 
to reach any agreement or decide how the case should be tried. Chiate called 
the potential mega-trial a "mega-disaster," and he and Norton had accused the 
county of wasting taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
Hogan was scheduled to preside over the huge trial next month, and it was 
expected to be one of the longest and most expensive civil trials in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
The trial would have involved more than 275 lawyers and was expected to last 
between two and five years. Attorneys' fees in the case were expected to be 
more than $100 million.

<TEXT>
<P>
Wilbert Rideau stared at the television screen as the words engulfed him. 
</P>
<P>
So it was happening again. The governor had said no, that his crime was too 
heinous, that being locked up for 27 years was not enough to pay for the 
murder. Wilbert Rideau had lost one more chance to leave prison behind him. 
</P>
<P>
The awards and the nationwide recognition meant nothing. Neither did the 
unblemished prison record. 
</P>
<P>
The cold hand of despair pushed against Rideau's chest. He had been too 
confident this time, believing that this new governor would accept yet another 
recommendation of the pardon board and let him go. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Horrible Nature' 
</P>
<P>
But then came the awful words on the evening newscast: "Given the horrible 
nature of this crime, the fact that both surviving victims oppose clemency and 
the fact that Calcasieu law enforcement officials oppose clemency, I deny 
Rideau's plea for a reduced sentence." The man who spoke them was Gov. Buddy 
Roemer. 
</P>
<P>
In his darkest hours, Rideau has wondered whether this fame of his was really a 
curse, the reason all those years had drifted by at the Angola State Prison. 
Maybe he should never have learned to be a writer. Maybe he would have been 
better off if he had kept his head down and blended into the prison backdrop. 
There is much time to think of what might have been when a man is a lifer in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Wilbert Rideau is a killer. He is a black man who murdered a white woman on a 
winter's day in 1961 during a bank robbery. He is also a man who, through the 
printed word, has perhaps told the outside world more about prison life than 
any other. He is the winner of some of the most prestigious awards in American 
journalism, a frequent panel member on criminal justice discussions and often 
referred to as one of the most rehabilitated prisoners in the United States. 
Certainly he is one of the most visible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refused by Two Governors 
</P>
<P>
Three times in the last four years, the state pardons board has recommended 
that his sentence be commuted and that he be immediately paroled. But the 
governor is the last hurdle in his bid for freedom and this hurdle has been 
impossible for him to clear. Two governors -- Roemer and Edwin W. Edwards 
before him -- have refused to free him, and no one else has the power because 
in this state there is no such thing as parole from a first- or second-degree 
murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have read Wilbert's writing over the last 15 years, as I have, it is 
evident he has a free mind trapped in a convict's body," said C. Paul Phelps, 
the former secretary of the Louisiana Department of Corrections and one of 
Rideau's strongest supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of his release scoff at such talk, saying that a man who can kill a 
woman as she begs for mercy, a woman he knew, ought to be locked up forever. 
</P>
<P>
"If this man committed this crime in this state today, he would be executed," 
said Gov. Roemer. "I would not be comfortable accepting the pardon board's 
recommendation." 
</P>
<P>
There are few who take the middle ground when it comes to Wilbert Rideau. 
</P>
<P>
When it happened in 1961, Julia Ferguson's murder and Rideau's arrest made up 
one of the most sensational cases of the day. The setting was Lake Charles, a 
southwest Louisiana city that sits opposite a phalanx of petrochemical plants 
that belch smoke and fire into the air, day and night. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 16 of that year, Rideau walked into the Southgate branch of the Gulf 
National Bank carrying a .22-caliber pistol, a hunting knife and a suitcase. 
The 19-year-old robber knew all these people, because he was a porter for 
Halpern's Fabric Shop in the same mall as the bank. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ordered at Gunpoint 
</P>
<P>
Rideau ordered the branch manager, Jay Hickman, to fill the suitcase at 
gunpoint. That done, he forced Hickman, along with bank tellers Ferguson and 
Dora McCain, into a car. Rideau ordered Ferguson to drive. 
</P>
<P>
If Rideau could reclaim an hour of his life, it would be this one. The robber 
and his hostages drove from Lake Charles to English Bayou, just north of the 
city. The exact circumstances of what happened then have been altered by time 
and many tellings. But testimony at the trials was that Rideau lined up the 
three and began firing the pistol he had bought the day before. 
</P>
<P>
Hickman was hit in the arm and he fled into the swamp, where Rideau presumed he 
had drowned after searching the murky waters. McCain was shot in the neck and 
torso, but feigned death and endured Rideau's kicks to her stomach. Ferguson, 
already shot once, rose up and the bank robber was upon her. 
</P>
<P>
She was begging for her life when Rideau slashed her throat with the hunting 
knife. Then he stabbed her in the heart. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't worry, it will be quick and cool," he told the woman before he killed 
her. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taped Confession Broadcast 
</P>
<P>
Rideau was arrested that same day. In a move that would come back to haunt him, 
Calcasieu Parish Sheriff "Ham" Reid allowed the local television station to 
secretly record his confession, one made without a lawyer present. For three 
nights running, Lake Charles residents watched as Rideau's confession went out 
over the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the trials, three of them. The first was thrown out by the U.S. 
Supreme Court because of the extraordinary pretrial publicity surrounding the 
case. The second, held in Baton Rouge, the state capital, also ended in a 
guilty verdict and a death sentence. But it, too, was thrown out, this time 
because the judge permitted the prosecution to exclude any potential jurors 
with doubts about the death sentence. The third of the trials finally stuck. 
Rideau was sentenced to be executed. He was transferred to Angola's Death Row, 
where he awaited his walk to the electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
Rideau can't say when the long march back from the brink began. It may have 
been in the East Baton Rouge jail as he awaited trial. It may have been later. 
Surely it didn't happen right away. For months, Wilbert Rideau remained a young 
murderer with no remorse for his deeds. And then, during those long months of 
solitary confinement, he said he began to think about what he had done. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not have a right to do this. I didn't have a right to hurt anybody," he 
said, sitting in the parole board hearing room at the prison. "The enormity of 
it all began to sink in. I did a lot of thinking and I began to realize I was 
sorry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Owe a Lot' 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't the hideous creature the crime implied. I knew that. I also realized 
I owe a lot and some that I could never pay back. The only thing that I could 
possibly salvage from all this was Wilbert Rideau." 
</P>
<P>
Rideau, a trim man of 46 now, was dressed in freshly pressed denim jeans, shirt 
and jacket. The years of good conduct had won him the right to wear civilian 
garb. His fingernails were neatly manicured and an unlit Camel cigarette rested 
between two fingers. He reflected on all those years, the lonely times on Death 
Row, the guards who first began to slip him books, the awakening of a mind. 
</P>
<P>
Some words from his 1978 petition for clemency: "As I read, a new world opened 
up to me. . . . There were stories of men who had faced great challenges and 
won, men who had been as empty and worthless as I, who had gone on to turn 
their lives into works of art, became immortal, revered and respected by their 
fellow human beings. . . . I found hope." 
</P>
<P>
From the reading came the writing and, finally, the opportunity for a second 
shot at life when the U.S. Supreme Court declared the death penalty 
unconstitutional in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Rideau the condemned became Rideau the lifer. By the time he left Death Row -- 
nine years after he entered prison -- Rideau had already written two 
unpublished novels and a criminal justice textbook. Once off Death Row, when he 
wasn't allowed to work on the prison magazine because the staff was white and 
he was black, he began a column called "The Lifer," which he distributed 
himself within the prison. He wrote another column for five newspapers in 
Louisiana and Mississippi called "The Jungle." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prison Ruled by Violence 
</P>
<P>
And then, in late 1975, Phelps became the acting warden at Angola. He had many 
ideas about how to tame his 18,000-acre prison, which at the time was one of 
the worst in the country. Inmates were being killed on an average of once a 
week. It was a prison ruled by violence, inhabited, as it is today, by the 
hardest of Louisiana's criminals. 
</P>
<P>
One of Phelps' thoughts was about the prison magazine, "The Angolite." He 
decided that for the first time, it would not be censored by prison officials, 
that it would be an open voice for the inmates. And he decided that Wilbert 
Rideau would be the next editor. 
</P>
<P>
The editorship of "The Angolite" became the source of Rideau's fame. Almost 
immediately, the awards started coming, first those for the penal press, then 
others. There was the George Polk Award, one of journalism's most prestigious, 
for a detailed account of the sexual abuses that go on inside prisons. 
</P>
<P>
Rape in prison, he wrote, "is not sexual and is not really regarded as 'rape' 
in the same sexual sense that society regards it. It is and means something 
entirely different in the world behind bars. In fact, it isn't even referred to 
as 'rape.' In the Louisiana penal system, both prisoners and personnel 
generally refer to the act as 'turning out,' a non-sexual description that 
reveals the non-sexual nature of what is really an act of conquest and 
demasculation. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Rideau has also won the Robert F. Kennedy award and the American Bar Assn.'s 
Silver Gavel award twice. And with the awards have come the news stories about 
the rehabilitation of Wilbert Rideau and editorials calling for his release. 
Rideau keeps a file of movie and book offers. 
</P>
<P>
Wardens spanning the last 15 years at Angola Prison support Rideau's release. 
The director of the American Civil Liberties Union national prison project, 
Alvin Bronstein, said Rideau has already served almost double the average time 
for a murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"If any person deserves to come back into society, Rideau is that person," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. James Stovall, executive director of the Louisiana Interchurch 
Conference, was Dora McCain's pastor when Rideau shot her and left her for dead 
on the side of the road. He, too, is for the release of Rideau. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a mature, stable individual," Stovall said. "I know him to be a brilliant 
writer and one who has the best understanding of what is happening in our 
correctional institutions than any other person in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Phelps, the former corrections secretary, thinks that is exactly where things 
went wrong for Rideau, that he became too famous: "I believe that if he had not 
become what he is, he would have been out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Falls on Deaf Ears 
</P>
<P>
All of this falls on deaf ears to those on the other side. They argue that 
Rideau shouldn't be released from prison just because he learned to write. 
</P>
<P>
Calcasieu Parish Dist. Atty. Richard Ieyoub once again brings up the common 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
"If Mr. Rideau were tried now, he would be convicted of first-degree murder and 
sentenced to death," he said. "I don't think Mr. Rideau has any reason to 
complain." 
</P>
<P>
This is, after all, Louisiana, one of the toughest states in the nation when it 
comes to sentencing criminals. The average sentence for armed robbery in the 
United States, for instance, is 24 months. In Louisiana, the minimum sentence 
is five years. 
</P>
<P>
On a per capita basis, only the Soviet Union and South Africa have more 
prisoners than those in Louisiana's prisons and jails, according to Carl 
Jackson of the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice. In 
Louisiana, Jackson said, there are 273 people in state prison for tampering 
with their electric meters. Eight are in prison for stealing dogs and two more 
are doing time for stealing fish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sold Pardons to Inmates 
</P>
<P>
And it is also the place where the former director of the state pardons board 
was arrested and pleaded guilty to selling pardons to inmates. He is now doing 
time in a federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
It is in this atmosphere that Rideau must try to gain his freedom. Roemer, 
though, has pledged to be even tougher on crime. 
</P>
<P>
Rideau, meanwhile, fights to keep his bitterness in check. 
</P>
<P>
"In no other justice system in the United States would I still be in prison," 
he said. "This could only happen in Louisiana because no other system would 
allow such a condition to exist." 
</P>
<P>
Linda LaBranch, an English professor at New Orleans' Loyola University, first 
saw Rideau when he was on ABC's "Nightline" being interviewed by Ted Koppel. 
Intrigued, she went to the library and read more about him. Then she went to 
visit him. She is now trying to free Rideau, working through the university's 
Institute of Human Relations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Willie Horton Factor' 
</P>
<P>
She blames racism, contending that Rideau would have been out long ago if his 
victims had been black. She says Roemer refuses to pardon Rideau, but he and 
previous governors have pardoned murderers who have served much shorter 
sentences. She calls Rideau a victim of what she terms the "Willie Horton 
factor," referring to the former Massachusetts prisoner who became a major 
issue during the presidential campaign when he killed a woman while he was on a 
weekend furlough. 
</P>
<P>
"The presidential race showed every politician in the country what would happen 
if he was perceived to be soft on crime," she said. "There is no justice here 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Roemer, who calls pardons one of the most difficult parts of his job 
as governor, says that there may someday be hope for Wilbert Rideau, but not 
now. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone can say never to Wilbert," Roemer said. "It's my opinion 
that at this time in this state, this man should not be released."

Rival Shia Muslim militias battled for the fourth day in Beirut's suburbs and 
in southern Lebanon. According to one report, the fighting between the 
pro-Syrian Amal and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militias intensified in the 
southern Beirut slums where 16 Western hostages are believed to be held. As 
many as 29 people have been reported killed, with dozens more wounded, since 
the fighting began Saturday.

A New Jersey teen-ager was in critical condition after eating cyanide-laced 
Breyer's yogurt, and the Acme Supermarkets chain that sold the tainted 
container pulled the company's yogurt from 166 stores in three states, 
officials said. Thomas Lee, 17, of Haddonfield in Camden County, became ill 
after eating the yogurt and was taken to West Jersey Hospital Eastern Division 
in Voorhees, officials said. The yogurt, Breyer's brand black cherry, bearing 
the code FEB 9, 1989, was tested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 
which confirmed the presence of cyanide. Law enforcement agencies are 
investigating the incident as a case of a suspected tampering, officials said. 
No cyanide was found in the 131 yogurt containers removed from Acme stores in 
Camden County, officials said.

The Orange County district attorney's office, as expected, will appeal a 
judge's extraordinary reversal last month of a jury's murder conviction against 
an Anaheim woman, who claimed she suffered from postpartum psychosis when she 
ran over her 6-week-old son. In filing an appeal with the 4th District Court of 
Appeal, prosecutors said, they will argue that Superior Court Judge Robert R. 
Fitzgerald had no legal authority to acquit Sheryl Lynn Massip on the grounds 
of insanity after a jury had convicted her of second-degree murder in the 
killing of her colicky infant son. In addition, Fitzgerald's action threatens 
to give judges greatly expanded power in criminal cases and to make juries 
"nothing more than an advisory board," Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Borris said.

An armored car guard was in critical condition after being shot during a 
robbery outside a Berkeley bank, police said. Two robbers fled south toward 
Oakland after Wells Fargo Bank robbery, escaping with a bag containing an 
unknown amount of money, police said. A Loomis Armored Inc. dispatcher said the 
guard underwent surgery at an area hospital and was in critical condition. He 
was not immediately identified. The second guard was not injured. The Loomis 
truck had just pulled up to the bank at College and Ashby streets.

The Irish Republican Army issued a veiled threat against Britain's Royal Family 
and leading British politicians in a New Year's message. The IRA message, 
published in the Irish media, urged supporters to "intensify their reminders to 
British royalty and political leaders" that 1989 is the 20th anniversary of the 
deployment of British troops in Northern Ireland and of what it called "British 
military and political failures" in the country. It added: "For our part, we 
shall be reminding them as well." The IRA, fighting to end British rule in 
Northern Ireland, killed Lord Mountbatten, a cousin of Britain's Queen 
Elizabeth II, in 1979 and narrowly missed killing British Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher in 1984.

Oil from a 231,000-gallon spill off the central Washington coast nearly two 
weeks ago has drifted more than 100 miles into the Strait of Juan de Fuca 
separating the state from Vancouver Island. The spill has killed more than 
3,200 sea birds, state officials said, with more expected to die despite 
hand-cleaning by volunteers. The latest bird cleaning station was set up at 
Neah Bay, on the northwest tip of the Olympic Peninsula. Oil from the Dec. 22 
spill has been detected as far south as Newport, Ore., and as far north as 
British Columbia, a 300-mile stretch. The leak began when a tugboat towing an 
oil barge punched a hole in the barge in high seas. Forty beach-cleaners worked 
on northern wilderness beaches soiled over the weekend when storm waves brought 
in oil thought to have dissipated at sea, said Doug Zimmer, a spokesman for the 
state Department of Wildlife.

A veteran Detroit school official was arraigned on a murder charge in the death 
of his wife, whose body was found in a freezer at their home more than three 
years after she was reported missing. Leonard Tyburski, 45, who heads the 
department of attendance at Detroit Mackenzie High School, was ordered held 
without bond on a charge of open murder after his arraignment in 35th District 
Court. The body of his wife, Dorothy Tyburski, was discovered Monday by their 
daughter, Kelly, 20, who had pried open the freezer door. Kelly Tyburski had 
reported her mother missing in October, 1985. The investigation of the 
disappearance of Dorothy Tyburski, who was 37 when she was reported missing, 
was dropped after two years because of lack of progress, police said.

The Army said it has inspected its fleet of CH-47D Chinook helicopters without 
finding any faulty transmissions and returned them to flight status. It 
grounded its 234 medium-lift Chinooks on Dec. 23, 1988, in what it termed a 
precautionary move after the manufacturer, the Boeing Co., reported that 
"certain transmissions may have been improperly assembled." Inspections of the 
aircraft did not uncover any such problem, Army spokeswoman Paige Eversole 
said. She said the inspections were considered complete even though 15 Chinooks 
had yet to be checked. The 15 include 10 used to train mechanics and five 
undergoing maintenance, she said. Ten Chinooks have been involved in accidents 
since 1985.

REAGAN OFFERS WHISTLE-BLOWER RIGHTS MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Reagan, who last year vetoed legislation intended to protect 
government whistle-blowers, proposed a new measure Tuesday that he said would 
provide similar protection without forcing government personnel managers into 
"routinely defending appropriate personnel decisions." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would give federal employees the right to appeal a personnel 
action before the Merit Systems Protection Board on the ground that the action 
had been taken as a reprisal for whistle-blowing. It would also establish the 
independence of the Office of Special Counsel within the government to protect 
federal employees from prohibited personnel practices. 
</P>
<P>
In a message to Congress, Reagan said that "federal employees who blow the 
whistle on fraud, waste, abuse and violations of the law help to ensure that 
the federal government uses American taxpayers' dollars effectively and 
efficiently." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protect From Reprisals 
</P>
<P>
"The nation's laws must encourage such reports and protect those who make them 
from reprisals," said the President, who is winding up a two-week vacation in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan drew sharp criticism, particularly in Congress, when, on Oct. 26, he 
vetoed legislation that would have protected whistle-blowers from being 
harassed or fired. The vetoed bill would have made the special counsel more of 
a lawyer for the employee rather than for the government. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration endorsed the original legislation, but later, Atty. Gen. 
Dick Thornburgh made a last-ditch appeal to Reagan, stating that the bill's 
protection mechanism was unwise and unconstitutional. He said that, if the bill 
went into effect, the government could have found itself in the odd position of 
suing itself over whistle-blowers' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, the President argued in his veto message that the bill's method 
of giving whistle-blowers more legal authority to fight against reprisals from 
their superiors "would have interfered substantially with personnel management" 
in the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
According to Michael Wermuth, deputy assistant attorney general for legislative 
affairs, the new measure would give government employees the right to sue the 
agencies for which they work -- a right he said they do not now have -- rather 
than handing that job over to the special counsel. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the Office of Special Counsel would be given the status 
of an independent federal agency, with the counsel appointed by the President 
and subject to removal. "The earlier version would have made the special 
counsel answerable to no one," Wermuth said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the measure Reagan proposed Tuesday, the special counsel would be 
empowered, during the course of investigations, to administer oaths, examine 
witnesses, take depositions and receive evidence. 
</P>
<P>
If the special counsel determined that a whistle-blowing government employee 
had been treated unfairly, that finding would be presented to the Merit Systems 
Protection Board, the Office of Personnel Management "and, in appropriate 
cases, the President." 
</P>
<P>
The board, which oversees federal government personnel practices, was 
established to protect the rights of federal employees. It hears and decides 
employee appeals of personnel actions and orders corrective and disciplinary 
actions against agencies or employees when appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.), who, along with Rep. Frank Horton (R-N.Y.), 
reintroduced the vetoed bill Tuesday, said that Reagan's proposal is no 
improvement over current law. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same refrain. It's a little quacking from the duck as it leaves 
town," she said, referring to the President's lame-duck status with barely two 
weeks left to his term. 
</P>

DUKAKIS WON'T SEEK 4TH TERM IN MASSACHUSETTS

Michael S. Dukakis announced Tuesday that he will not run again for governor of 
Massachusetts, triggering speculation that the former Democratic nominee might 
be considering a rematch for the presidency with George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Boston, Dukakis gave few hints about his plans. He 
said that his decision not to seek an unprecedented fourth term, made two years 
before his term expires, was "totally independent of another try at national 
office." However, he said, he learned during the fall presidential campaign 
that it is "exceedingly difficult" to run for the White House as a sitting 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope you don't have to be unemployed to run for the presidency, or at least 
effectively unemployed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis announced the decision first to his state cabinet members at a morning 
meeting, then to reporters at the hastily called press conference. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Never Say Never' 
</P>
<P>
Asked repeatedly about his plans, Dukakis would go no further than to say 
"never say never." Publicly, his close associates were taking the same line. "I 
just don't know," said Dukakis' former campaign chief, John Sasso, when asked 
about the prospect of another presidential race. "I don't think he knows," 
Sasso added. 
</P>
<P>
However, aides confirmed that Dukakis has talked to friends about the 
possibility of running again and several former campaign aides and Democratic 
strategists suggested Tuesday that the decision to forgo another Statehouse 
race could be the first step toward a second White House bid. 
</P>
<P>
The lure of presidential races often proves strong for those who have tried and 
lost. One former candidate, Rep. Morris K. Udall (D-Ariz.) once quipped that 
the only known cure for the presidential fever "is embalming fluid." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Strengths 
</P>
<P>
As a potential presidential candidate for 1992, Dukakis would start with 
several strengths -- name recognition, proven ability to raise funds and an 
organization in some key states. The idea of having a candidate who already has 
been exposed to the rigors of the race "is a good one, for all the obvious 
reasons," Sasso said. 
</P>
<P>
But Dukakis also would face a severe disadvantage: Many party activists, whose 
enthusiasm is critical for a successful presidential bid, hold him personally 
responsible for losing an election that many believed he could have won. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks immediately after the presidential vote, aides had talked about 
Dukakis being tired, dispirited and for the first time seemingly worn down by 
the pressures of his job, particularly a large and lingering state budget 
deficit. More recently, however, "it really seemed for the first time that the 
governor was back," one state cabinet member said. Dukakis, he added, has been 
"showing a fair amount of feistiness and readiness to go out and fight." 
</P>
<P>
And fights he will have. Controversial new taxes may be required to ease the 
state budget deficit. The prospect appears to have spurred his decision not to 
seek another term as governor. "Given the challenges he faces, particularly the 
fiscal situation, he feels he can serve the state best without the question of 
his own political future on the horizon," Sasso said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, with fellow Democrats eager to know whether they would have a 
clear field should they decide to run, "it seemed to me desirable to make the 
decision now, rather than later," Dukakis said. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous Democrats are expected to seek the governor's job. On the outnumbered 
Republican side, Andrew Card Jr., a key Bush campaigner who will be serving as 
a senior deputy to John H. Sununu once Sununu becomes White House chief of 
staff, has been talking about making the race.

REAGAN TO UNDERGO SURGERY ON FINGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Reagan will undergo surgery on the ring finger of his left hand 
Saturday to repair a slight involuntary contracture, the White House announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The condition, known as Dupuytren's Contracture, was described by Army Col. 
John E. Hutton Jr., the President's physician, as minimal at the time Reagan 
took office in 1981, but Hutton said in a written statement that it had 
progressed sufficiently to require surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The President, who is scheduled to return to the White House Thursday after a 
two-week vacation in Southern California, will be admitted to Walter Reed Army 
Medical Center in Washington Friday afternoon and is expected to return to the 
White House Sunday. The two- to three-hour procedure will be carried out 
Saturday morning, under regional anesthesia of the arm. Hutton said that 
general anesthesia is not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The condition is a progressive, usually painless contraction of the fingers for 
which there is no treatment other than surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The surgery requires a bulky post-operative dressing from the fingers to the 
upper arm for several days, and, in some cases, the use of a splint.

ARAFAT REMAINS A TERRORIST, ISRAELI OFFICIAL SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
AS PROOF, NEW FOREIGN MINISTER ARENS CITES THREAT AGAINST MODERATE ARABS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A threat by Yasser Arafat against Palestinians who propose a lull in the Arab 
uprising is proof that Arafat still clings to terrorism, Israel's new foreign 
minister, Moshe Arens, said Tuesday as he once again rejected calls for talks 
with the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Arens, who spoke at his first press conference since taking office two weeks 
ago, criticized both the United States and European countries for entering into 
talks with the PLO and said Israel would prefer isolation to changing its mind 
on the issue. The former Israeli ambassador to Washington promised that new 
peace proposals are on the way from Israel but have not yet been finalized. 
</P>
<P>
Arens' comments came in response to a Kuwait News Agency report from Saudi 
Arabia on Arafat's position on the intifada, as the revolt is known in Arabic. 
According to the report, Arafat warned that "any Palestinian leader who 
proposes an end to the intifada exposes himself to the bullets of his own 
people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mayor of Bethlehem 
</P>
<P>
Arafat, the PLO's chairman, mentioned no names, but the comment seemed to refer 
to Elias Freij, the longtime mayor of Bethlehem. On Christmas Day, Freij 
proposed a truce between Israel and the Palestinians who for more than a year 
have been fighting Israeli rule on the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Upon being informed of Arafat's warning, Freij, who is considered a leading 
moderate on the West Bank, withdrew his suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision of the PLO does not support my proposal," he told the Jerusalem 
Post. "I fully respect the decision of the PLO that the time is not right to 
make such a suggestion." 
</P>
<P>
Freij, an Arab Christian, insisted that his life is not in danger. "It's not a 
threat. I didn't do anything wrong. I made a suggestion in good faith." 
</P>
<P>
Arens, speaking in heavily American-accented English, took a harsher view. He 
accused Arafat of "threatening with extinction any Palestinian who talks about 
the possibility of a cessation of acts of violence." 
</P>
<P>
Pressed on whether Israel itself would make some positive gesture should 
leaders in the occupied land offer a truce, he replied: "I prefer not to 
address this specific question. 
</P>
<P>
"We have already seen that anybody who voices opinions of this sort puts his 
life in danger because of the threat of terrorist action against them. I think 
at this point we better leave it as it is." 
</P>
<P>
Israel is not tempted to call a truce on its own, Arens added. 
</P>
<P>
"The government of Israel doesn't have to propose any truce because the 
government of Israel is not initiating any violence in Judea, Samaria and 
Gaza," he said. Judea and Samaria are the biblical names for the West Bank 
region. 
</P>
<P>
Arens is scheduled to travel to Paris this week to attend an international 
conference on chemical weapons. He is expected to meet with several European 
foreign ministers, a circumstance that will give him the chance to voice 
displeasure at their contacts with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
13-Year Ban Ended 
</P>
<P>
Arafat has gained the ear of Western governments through his avowed 
renunciation of terrorism and his explicit recognition of Israel's right to 
exist. Last month, the United States ended a 13-year ban on public contact with 
the PLO, based in part on Arafat's renunciation of terror. 
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that establishing contact or, worse yet, extending 
recognition to the PLO cannot possibly promote peace in the Middle East," Arens 
declared. "It is bound to encourage extremism and further acts of violence." 
</P>
<P>
The owlish former aeronautical engineer made it clear that Israel will not 
follow the diplomatic trend. 
</P>
<P>
"We should not be expected to take any step that might decrease the sense of 
isolation . . . if they are steps that would endanger the state of Israel," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Arens commented ironically on reports that Washington turned to the PLO for 
help in locating saboteurs who blew up a Pan American jet in the air over 
Scotland last month. "If we search the world for an organization that had 
experience and competence in terrorist acts, and especially in blowing up 
airplanes, you could probably not find a better address than the PLO and Mr. 
Arafat," Arens remarked. 
</P>
<P>
While on the subject of terrorism, Arens evaded a question about whether 
attacks on soldiers by rebellious Arabs fit Israel's definition of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that when there is a deliberate attempt to kill civilians we are 
dealing with terrorism, regardless of where it takes place and regardless of 
under what circumstances it takes place," he said, leaving aside the issue of 
clashes with the military. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has been promising to unveil a new peace formula since 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir took office for a new four-year term last month. 
On Tuesday, however, Arens spoke only of "interim arrangements" that might lead 
to resolution of the conflict. In Israeli political language, "interim 
arrangements" mean limited political and social autonomy for Arabs on the 
occupied land. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Will Take Some Time' 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Arens said that new Israeli ideas will come slowly. "This is a 
process that will take some time," he advised. 
</P>
<P>
Arens took time out to reject proposals that would push Israel back to its 
borders that existed before the 1967 Six-Day War, when Israel routed invading 
Arab armies and occupied both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The postwar 
frontiers gave Israel needed space for defense, Arens contended. "It is 
impossible to envisage the security of Israel without defensible borders," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Arens' opening remarks to reporters took the form of a state-of-diplomacy 
message. While commenting adversely on foreign contacts with the PLO, he 
pointed to several bright spots in Israel's relations abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Washington's PLO contacts, he described relations with the United 
States as outstanding. He also said that Israel virtually considered itself a 
member of the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel "appreciated" the permission to emigrate granted to Jews by 
the Soviet Union and hoped that it presaged renewed diplomatic ties between the 
two countries. "There seems good reason to expect significant improvements in 
the relationship between the two countries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union broke relations with Israel after the Six-Day War. 
</P>
<P>
Arens also expects to meet with China's foreign minister in Paris. The Chinese 
also have no diplomatic links with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Arens will not be the only Israeli carrying on some form of diplomacy in the 
coming weeks. Four members of the Knesset, Israel's Parliament, intend to 
travel to Europe soon to meet with officials of the PLO. The four Israelis are 
all considered left-wing doves. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to speak to the Palestinians directly and reach peace with them 
through compromise," said Knesset member Lova Eliav, a member of the 
center-left Labor Party. Labor is a junior partner in the Israeli ruling 
coalition led by Shamir's rightist Likud Party.

REPORTS OF 17 QUAKE SURVIVORS DENIED BY TASS

The Tass news agency on Tuesday denied reports in the Western media that 17 
more survivors were found in a ruined bread factory more than three weeks after 
the Dec. 7 earthquake in Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
French and British broadcast reports said the survivors existed on grain and 
melted snow until they were discovered in the wrecked city of Spitak in 
northwestern Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
But Tass quoted Norik Muradyan, chief of rescue operations in Spitak, as saying 
Tuesday in a telephone interview: "The last living person was removed by 
rescuers from the ruins of buildings and structures in Spitak 10 days ago." He 
said reports of the 17 survivors "have no foundation." 
</P>
<P>
Tass said that 28 additional bodies were pulled from the rubble since Thursday, 
bringing the total of recovered bodies to 24,888.

BAJA GOVERNOR QUITS JOB EARLY

<TEXT>
<P>
The governor of Baja California said Tuesday that he will step down early to 
take a position with a federal banking agency negotiating to reduce Mexico's 
foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise announcement by Xicontencatl Leyva Mortera at a press conference 
in Mexicali, the state capital, fueled speculation that he is being forced out 
by Mexico's new president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Leyva's term was to 
extend to the end of October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Some Baja commentators have suggested that political leaders in Mexico City are 
unhappy with Leyva, whose five-year administration has been marked by several 
prominent scandals and political defeats. In July, 1988, Salinas was defeated 
in Baja by leftist Cuauhtemoc Cardenas.

CASTRO PLEDGES TO RELEASE 225 MORE PRISONERS 
</P>

<P>
The Cuban government has pledged to free the remaining 225 prisoners it has 
recognized as political, including 44 it previously described as too dangerous 
to release, according to a senior Cuban official and Western diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
The promise was conveyed in recent weeks from President Fidel Castro to the 
U.S. Catholic Conference, which has been pressing since 1985 for the prisoners' 
release, the diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
Of more than 470 prisoners on the government's roster of those who have faced 
political charges, about 225 remain in jail. About 250 were released during 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
The political prisoners that the government has acknowledged include those 
named in a list of about 450 presented to Cuba in May, 1988, by Cardinal John 
O'Connor of New York City. During the summer, Castro said everyone on that list 
would be freed except 44, whom he described as too dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
The government has not admitted that anyone else among its approximately 30,000 
prisoners is being held on political charges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Require U.S. Visas 
</P>
<P>
Now, Castro has said he also will free the 44 prisoners he originally rejected, 
on the condition that they be granted visas to travel immediately to the United 
States, a high-ranking Communist Party official confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and human rights activists in Havana welcomed the pledge as part of a 
limited but significant improvement in the human rights picture in Cuba that 
has taken place over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
In a new sign of that progress, members of the small Cuban Party for Human 
Rights announced they will attempt to start a newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
However, it remains unclear whether all the prisoners would be eligible for 
admission into the United States. At least 24 released last year were denied 
visas because of criminal histories, according to a list drawn up by Elizardo 
Sanchez, head of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National 
Reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said that hundreds of Cubans will remain behind bars for essentially 
political causes after all of the 470 are freed.

HOUSE COALITION REINTRODUCES ERA IN CONGRESS

<P>
A bipartisan coalition of more than 130 House members on Tuesday reintroduced 
the equal rights amendment in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment, which became the first joint resolution of the 101st Congress, 
must be approved by two-thirds of both the House and Senate and ratified by 
three-fourths of the states to become part of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The extended deadline for ratification of the last ERA resolution expired June 
30, 1982, three states short of the 38 necessary to support the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Equality of Rights' 
</P>
<P>
The amendment introduced Tuesday, like the previous resolution, states: 
"Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United 
States or by any state on account of sex." 
</P>
<P>
The measure was co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of 137 House members. Its 
primary sponsor is Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), who chairs the House 
Judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights. Among co-sponsors 
are Rep. Hamilton Fish Jr. (R-N.Y.), the ranking Republican on the House 
Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.), a longtime ERA 
proponent. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution is expected to be introduced in the Senate next month, and 
Edwards said he expects to hold hearings on the measure before his subcommittee 
in February or March. 
</P>
<P>
"Let this year be the one in which we finally bring women into the 
Constitution," Edwards said in a statement. "It is time we extend full equality 
of rights under the law to all of our citizens."

INFANT MORTALITY AT RECORD LOW, CUBA SAYS

Cuba's infant mortality rate has dropped to 12 per 1,000 live births, its 
lowest level ever and one of the 20 lowest in the world, the state-run Prensa 
Latina news agency said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Infant mortality was 60 per 1,000 in 1959, when the average life expectancy of 
a Cuban was 50 years compared with 74 now. Health care has been one of the 
priorities of the Cuban revolution, which marks its 30th anniversary this week.

Cyanide has been found in a container of yogurt eaten by a teen-ager who became 
critically ill Tuesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reported.

Laboratory tests by the FDA confirmed the presence of cyanide and federal 
officials informed the state Health Department.

The victim, Thomas Lee, 17, of Haddonfield, was in critical condition at West 
Jersey Hospital's Eastern Division in Voorhees, said George Kerns, a spokesman 
for Camden County prosecutor Samuel Asbell. 
</P>
<P>
The cyanide, a rat poison, was found in an 8-ounce container of Breyer's black 
cherry yogurt with the code date Feb. 9, 1989. Officials say the yogurt was 
purchased from either the Haddonfield or Westmont Acme supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
Acme has removed all yogurt from five Camden County stores and Breyer's yogurt 
products from all of its stores, the Health Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft Inc. Dairy Group, based in Philadelphia, is withdrawing all flavors of 
Breyer's yogurt from retail stores in the Delaware Valley because of suspected 
tampering. 
</P>
<P>
The Dairy Group announced Tuesday night that it is cooperating with the FDA, 
local law enforcement and public health authorities in the investigation of the 
incident, which is believed to be an isolated product tampering. There have 
been no other reports of illness. 
</P>
<P>
The company said Breyer's yogurt packages have a tamper-evident seal.

PUC WARNS OF LONG-DISTANCE SERVICE FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission warned consumers Tuesday that as 
many as 25 unauthorized companies may be trying to sell long-distance telephone 
services illegally in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Marco Valenti, manager of the PUC's consumer affairs branch, said the 
unauthorized companies seem to concentrate on residential customers and small 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, he said, the companies offer some form of flat fee for unlimited 
long-distance calling or discounts for signing up friends and relatives. In 
many cases, Valenti said, the firms lease only a few telephone lines from major 
long-distance carriers, and these lines soon become so crowded that customers 
find them constantly busy. 
</P>
<P>
Valenti also cited a case in which a consumer responded to a sales pitch by 
mailing $500 to an office address in Dallas only to find later, after 
contacting the PUC, that there was no record of any such company. The money has 
not been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Valenti urged consumers approached by representatives of long-distance 
companies with which they are unfamiliar to check with the PUC in Los Angeles 
(213-620-2570) or in San Francisco (415-557-1048) to make sure the firms are 
certified by the state. The State Department of Consumer Affairs also offers a 
booklet, "Choosing a Long-Distance Telephone Company," that can be ordered by 
calling 916-445-1254. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of long-distance telephone companies have started selling service 
since the breakup of the Bell System five years ago, Valenti noted. The PUC 
certifies more than 120 firms to provide service in California. These companies 
are required to file their prices with the commission and to submit to state 
regulatory procedures.

More than 200,000 ethnic German refugees from Eastern Europe came to West 
Germany last year, the highest number since the formation of the country in 
1949, an Interior Ministry spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A total of the 202,673 ethnic refugees were handled by transit camps and 
granted German citizenship. The majority of 140,226 were from Poland, with 
47,572 from the Soviet Union, said Horst Waffenschmidt, parliamentary state 
secretary at the Foreign Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 39,832 East Germans legally left their Communist homeland to settle 
in West Germany, compared to only 18,958 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The number of ethnic refugees coming to West Germany this year is likely to be 
even greater, said Waffenschmidt. He added that Bonn has set aside some $1.1 
billion for their integration.

</P>
<P>
Boe, who joined Allstate in 1941 and worked for the insurance company or its 
parent, Sears, until retirement in 1984, died Monday at Northwestern Memorial

LUCAS TRIAL BEGINS; FACES CHARGES IN SIX SLAYINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long delayed by an arduous jury selection process and numerous evidentiary 
hearings, the Superior Court trial of David Allen Lucas began Tuesday -- four 
years after the former Spring Valley carpet cleaner was arrested and accused in 
a string of brutal slayings between 1979 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In an hourlong opening statement, prosecutors revealed nothing new but told 
jurors that physical evidence and testimony from one victim who survived an 
attack will link Lucas to "the most vicious and cold-blooded murders San Diego 
County has ever had to suffer." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers representing Lucas pledged in their opening remarks to prove that their 
client is as much a victim as the six women and two toddlers whose throats he 
allegedly slashed. During a 90-minute preview of their case, the defense 
attorneys blamed another man for two of the slayings and sought to pump holes 
in testimony and other prosecution evidence said to implicate Lucas in four 
other killings. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe when you hear all the evidence in this case and evaluate it 
objectively, you will find David Lucas is not guilty of these charges," 
attorney Alex Landon told the 12 jurors and six alternates hearing the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Face Death Penalty 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, 33, was arrested Dec. 16, 1984, at his home in Spring Valley. He is 
charged with six counts of murder, one count of attempted murder and two counts 
of kidnaping. If convicted of the murder charges, Lucas could face the death 
penalty. His trial, before Superior Court Judge Laura Palmer Hammes, is 
expected to last six months. 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom was packed for the trial's long-awaited launching Tuesday, with 
relatives of Lucas and his alleged victims watching intently as opening 
arguments and testimony from four prosecution witnesses unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, a tall blond with an athletic build who operated his own carpet cleaning 
business at the time of his arrest, sat motionless throughout much of the day, 
occasionally jotting notes and conferring with his two attorneys. When jurors 
filed out for court recesses, he stood and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel Williams, who is prosecuting the case with assistance 
from Deputy Dist. Atty. George Clarke, used his opening statement to provide 
jurors with a chronological overview of the six murders and one attempted 
murder Lucas is charged with committing. 
</P>
<P>
In a solemn tone, Williams began his remarks by reciting the grim details of 
the throat wound that the seven victims shared -- "a massive incision to the 
upper neck, which extended in depth to the neck bone." The murder victims' 
throats were slashed with such force, investigators have said, that they were 
nearly decapitated. 
</P>
<P>
According to the prosecution's version, Lucas struck first on May 4, 1979, 
killing Suzanne Camille Jacobs, 31, and her son Colin, 3, in the family's 
Normal Heights home. Williams said one neighbor spotted a sports car -- similar 
to one driven by Lucas -- in the Jacobs' driveway that morning, while another 
noticed a blond man in the front yard. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. (Michael) Jacobs came home that afternoon and found his wife and son . . . 
with their necks cut, their necks slashed," Williams said. "There was a massive 
amount of blood." 
</P>
<P>
Scouring the scene for clues, police found two key pieces of evidence, Williams 
said -- a bloody boot print and a note, bearing the words "Love Insurance" and 
a telephone number, on a rug in the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
The boot print, Williams argued, "matches in every detail the type of sole" on 
a pair of boots Lucas allegedly had purchased a month earlier. As for the note, 
an analysis showed the handwriting matched that of Lucas, who purchased a Love 
Insurance policy soon after the slayings, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Slayings 
</P>
<P>
The next murder Lucas is charged with committing occurred Dec. 8, 1981, when 
real estate agent Gayle Garcia, 29, was found slain in a Spring Valley home she 
was scheduled to show to prospective buyers that day. Prosecutors said evidence 
will show Lucas had been searching the classified ads for a new home in Spring 
Valley at the time of the Garcia killing and that he was missing from work the 
afternoon the agent was killed. 
</P>
<P>
On June 7, 1984, Jodie Santiago Robertson of Seattle was kidnaped while walking 
to her brother's house from an El Cajon restaurant about 10 p.m. At Lucas' 
preliminary hearing, Robertson identified him as the man who abducted her at 
knifepoint, drove her to a house, and choked her until she lost consciousness. 
Robertson does not recall what happened next, but she was found the next day 
beside a rural road, half-naked and with her throat slashed. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Williams said Lucas sold his sports car and bought a pickup truck 
two days after the press disclosed that Robertson had been attacked but 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas also is charged with three additional murders -- those of Rhonda Strang, 
24; Amber Fisher, 3, a girl Strang was baby-sitting, and Anne Catherine Swanke, 
a 22-year-old University of San Diego student, who was abducted when her car 
ran out of gas late at night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Composite Sketch 
</P>
<P>
It was not until after Swanke's death on Nov. 20, 1984, that attention began to 
focus on Lucas. Police sensed a pattern in the attack on Robertson and the 
killings of Strang, Swanke and Fisher, and released a composite sketch of the 
assailant based on Robertson's description. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys said Tuesday that a "frantic search" for the killer -- based 
in part on a reward posted by Swanke's family and pressure to solve the crimes 
-- led authorities to wrongly accuse Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly egregious, attorney Steven Temko argued, are the charges involving 
the deaths of Suzanne and Colin Jacobs -- whose murders another man, Johnny 
Massingale, had confessed to committing. Massingale, an illiterate Kentucky 
drifter, was initially arrested as a prime suspect in the Jacobs killings after 
an Alabama man told a Texas Ranger that he had met a man who claimed to have 
"damn near decapitated" two people in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Massingale confessed to the slayings during an interrogation. But three weeks 
after Lucas was arrested, the drifter was released when prosecutors conceded 
that they had reservations about his guilt all along and concluded that his 
statements were coerced. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Temko argued that Massingale indicated in his confession that he 
knew things only the killer could know -- such as details of the crime scene 
and the nature of the wounds. 
</P>
<P>
As for the other deaths, the defense team argued that sloppy police work -- 
resulting in the disappearance of a fingerprint found on the Love Insurance 
note and a mix-up involving fingernail clippings from Swanke -- may have caused 
the loss of evidence that might have exonerated Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
Temko also suggested that Garcia's boyfriend -- who was killed last year -- was 
a strong suspect in her death. And Strang, he argued, had obtained a 
restraining order against her husband -- who allegedly was dealing narcotics -- 
not long before she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Landon concluded the defense presentation by raising doubts about the 
credibility of Robertson, the strongest witness the prosecution has in its case 
against Lucas. Noting that Robertson has been diagnosed as having 
post-traumatic stress syndrome, Landon argued that she has "a need for 
resolution" and "the need to find the person who did this to her."

BAJA GOVERNOR'S RESIGNATION TIED TO POLITICAL FALLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Xicotencatl Leyva Mortera, the sometimes-embattled governor of Baja California, 
announced Tuesday that he will leave his post 10 months early to take a 
position with a federal banking agency negotiating to reduce Mexico's foreign 
debt. His departure could come within a week, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Leyva's surprise announcement, made during a press conference in Mexicali, the 
state capital, immediately fueled speculation that the governor was being 
forced out by Mexico's new president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who took 
office Dec. 1. Mexican governors are considered the direct representatives of 
the powerful president. 
</P>
<P>
Some Baja journalists have suggested that political leaders in Mexico City have 
been increasingly unhappy with Leyva, whose five-year administration has been 
marked by several prominent scandals and stunning political setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
These events have unfolded at a time when Baja, although home to fewer than 3 
million people, has assumed an ever-greater role in Mexico's national scene as 
a result of the state's booming economy -- a product, largely, of U.S.-related 
trade. The U.S. dollars earned by assembly plants and tourism along the border 
are seen in Mexico City as critical to alleviating Mexico's crushing foreign 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Star Believed to Have Plummeted 
</P>
<P>
Leyva's political star within the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party -- 
known by its Spanish acronym as PRI -- was believed to have plummeted to new 
depths in the July presidential elections when Salinas, candidate of the ruling 
party, was defeated in Baja by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, candidate of a leftist 
coalition. Baja was one of only a handful of states, along with Mexico City, 
where Salinas acknowledged defeat. 
</P>
<P>
But Leyva, in his statement, said he was leaving to take on a new challenge 
with Nacional Financiera, a government banking agency. Leyva, a lawyer who 
considers himself a specialist in public financing, said he was asked by the 
president to assume the position in Washington. He said he will have 
responsibility for assisting in renegotiation of Mexico's foreign debt, which 
now tops $100 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great honor," Miguel Angel Torres, chief spokesman for Leyva, said 
by telephone from Mexicali Tuesday evening. "The foreign debt is one of the 
principal problems facing our nation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interim Successor Is Expected 
</P>
<P>
The state legislature is expected to name an interim successor to Leyva within 
the next week, said Torres, Leyva's spokesman. Hugo Felix, a longtime aide to 
the 
</P>
<P>
governor, is one rumored replacement. 
</P>
<P>
The interim governor will serve until Oct. 31, when Leyva's six-year term 
expires. Gubernatorial elections in Baja are scheduled in July, and the 
competition is expected to be intense. The PRI has never lost a gubernatorial 
election during its 60 years in control of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Leyva, 48, a native of the southern Mexican state of Veracruz and a distant 
relative of former Mexican President Miguel Aleman, served as mayor of Tijuana, 
Baja's most populous municipality, from 1977 to 1979. He is generally credited 
with doing a credible job as mayor and during a stint for the federal Finance 
Ministry in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Leyva has earned fewer plaudits in the governor's post, which he assumed in 
November, 1983. During his administration, the PRI has twice lost mayoral 
elections in Ensenada, a municipality of more than 200,000 people south of 
Tijuana. Those losses preceded the party's shocking defeat in July's 
presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
His administration has also weathered several scandals, some involving alleged 
corruption of law-enforcement officials by drug traffickers who have become a 
powerful force in the border state. Last year, the governor was harshly 
criticized for an alleged cover-up by authorities investigating the slaying of 
Hector (Gato) Felix Miranda, an irreverent columnist who was gunned down on his 
way to work. Leyva denied any cover-up, but thousands of protesters demanded 
his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the criticisms, Leyva is credited with facilitating the expansion of 
Baja's economy and opening the way for the entry of additional U.S. and 
Japanese investors.

<P>
A Crest man was booked early Tuesday morning in the slaying of his 67-year-old 
mother, whose body was buried in her yard. 
</P>
<P>
Ashley Victor Demers, 26, was arrested after the body of his mother, Anna Adele 
Demers, was found in a shallow grave just 75 feet from the mobile home where 
she lived, in the 2000 block of Old Bend Road. The body was so decomposed that 
officials could not determine the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies went to the woman's home about 4 p.m. to check on her 
welfare after neighbors reported they had not seen her for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
When deputies arrived at the home, which appeared to be vacant, they entered 
and found Ashley Demers inside. Demers reportedly said later that he had buried 
his mother several weeks ago on the property. 
</P>
<P>
Demers was being held without bail and will be arraigned at 10 a.m. today.

This woman knew as do all potential drug addicts that cocaine is addictive. 
Willingly abusing drugs is not a disease, it is a choice. Toni Hudson of her 
own free will decided to take cocaine. There was no disease to impair her 
judgment or cause her to take it against her will. The only disease she is 
suffering from is stupidity. 
</P>
<P>
She is guilty of child abuse from the moment she decided not to take or use 
birth control. There is enough information available to her and other potential 
drug addicts to warn them against the dangers of drug abuse, and the harmful 
effects to pregnant women and their unborn children. Again, it was her choice 
not to use birth control and her choice to use cocaine.

being placed in a hospital to suffer during his young life punishment enough

Prof. Laurence Goldstein's lament ("Ground Down by High-Rise Fever," Editorial 
Page, Dec. 24), about the disappearance of the old-fashioned homeyness of a 
city, is easy to sympathize with. Others may see beauty in endless towers and 
little else. Thus, I recall a lady's remark as she confronted the venerable 
skyscraper in New York, the Woolworth Building. She exclaimed, "My! How 
heavenly!" Not all would agree. Be that as it may, I offer one small 
suggestion; more greenery to the scenery, please!

AUTO INSURANCE CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the automobile insurance companies profess to be seeking to hold down 
costs, my recent experience indicates the contrary. The approach utilized by my 
insurance company is structured to unnecessarily encourage higher repair costs 
and thus "justify" higher insurance premiums and correspondingly greater 
profits. The process needs to be changed if insurance costs are to be cut. 
</P>
<P>
The higher than required expenditures result from the way the repair work is 
authorized. After a recent accident, two bids of $1,100 and $1,000 were 
obtained for repairing the damage to my vehicle. The company's adjuster 
authorized $1,495. The company's instructions called for the insured (myself) 
to take the adjuster's authorization to the repair shop, a mistake. The repair 
shop then magically found additional work that had to be done which escalated 
the cost up to the amount authorized, $1,494 in my case. Inasmuch as I knew my 
insurance rates were going to go up because of the accident and not because of 
an expenditure related to the cost of repairing my car, and the company 
reimburses 100% of costs over the deductible, there was no motivation to keep 
costs in line. The result is that those insured by the company are going to be 
asked to indirectly pay for nearly $500 in unnecessary repair costs in the form 
of higher premiums. 
</P>
<P>
Had my insurance company structured its rates and reimbursement schedule to 
provide for the insured to pay a percentage of the costs in addition to the 
deductible, as is typically the case for most medical insurance, all parties 
would have been better motivated to keep costs in line. The insurance companies 
need to realize that unless they encourage cost savings, the pressure to 
dictate an arbitrary premium reduction will continue unabated.

TELEVISION'S GHOST TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two decades ago the major television stations in Los Angeles, San Francisco and 
San Diego maintained full-time news bureaus in Sacramento to cover California 
government. Today not a single TV station outside Sacramento itself has a 
resident correspondent assigned to monitor the governmental affairs of the 
nation's largest state. San Francisco's KRON-TV closed the last out-of-town 
bureau late last year. 
</P>
<P>
In past, simpler times a newspaper might be tempted to gloat that a 
considerable segment of its media competition had decided to leave a broad area 
of coverage primarily to print journalism. But that cannot be the case today. 
The need for an informed public is too important, and many of California's 28 
million residents rely on television as their primary source of news. Too much 
is at stake. Television provides a dimension and an impact that print 
journalism cannot. As Harry Snider of Consumers Union told The Times' Dennis 
McDougal, public officials from the governor on down "know that they can ride 
out a print story or a radio sound bite . . . . But none of them want to be 
caught giving away the farm on the 6 o'clock news in Los Angeles or San 
Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
TV has an impact not just in times of big stories or scandal. In the past, such 
big network-owned stations as KNBC-TV, KABC-TV and KCBS-TV assigned excellent 
correspondents like Warren Olney, Bob Simmons and Howard Gingold to Sacramento. 
Their presence and expertise on a variety of state issues represented a source 
of competition within the Sacramento press corps that now is lacking. Everyone 
suffers. 
</P>
<P>
KNBC News Director Tom Capra said that cost and the demands of local news 
coverage brought about his station's closure of its Sacramento bureau six years 
ago. He said that KNBC gets all the Sacramento news that it needs from wire 
services and free-lancers while dispatching its own reporters from Los Angeles 
on big-story days. But that is no substitute for having a savvy correspondent 
on the scene who is able to follow the evolution of complicated stories on a 
day-to-day basis. 
</P>
<P>
Economics cannot be ignored, but the television stations also bear a public 
responsibility in exchange for their licenses to use the air waves. The 
networks still manage to maintain bureaus of more than 100 people each in 
Washington, but their local offspring decline to spend enough to keep a single 
correspondent in Sacramento. That's the way it is. And that's too bad.

A SUPERIOR PRINCIPAL IS LOST; 
</P>
<P>
WEIGHT OF ACADEMIC BUREAUCRACY CANCELS OUT AN ACHIEVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY MATHEWS, Jay Mathews, Los Angeles bureau chief of the Washington Post, 
is the author of Escalante: The Best Teacher in America (Henry Holt &amp; Co., 
1988). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My friend Henry Gradillas, probably the best high-school principal in the city, 
is about to leave his job with the Los Angeles Unified School District. The 
state Department of Education has hired him to help improve school 
decision-making. The children in the schools that he visits will surely benefit 
from the influence of the man who helped transform Garfield High School. 
</P>
<P>
Still, several of Gradillas' admirers, including me, wonder why his own school 
district, the second-largest in the country, could not put his unusual talents 
to work when he returned last summer from his doctoral sabbatical. Why did this 
district, so in need of Gradillas' skill in motivating disadvantaged 
teen-agers, choose instead to assign him to scheduling asbestos inspections -- 
a kind of academic Siberia? 
</P>
<P>
The problem extends far beyond Gradillas. His story is only one small measure 
of the deadening weight of academic bureaucracy on public education. The school 
district not only misused him but also has seemed to shrug at the surprising, 
and important, success of Garfield High, Gradillas' now famous East Los Angeles 
school. This record of clumsiness and inattention reveals the risks that an 
assertive individual like Gradillas takes when trying to change a system that 
has worked tolerably well for everybody but the students whom it is supposed to 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
I was drawn to Garfield initially by one of Gradillas' teachers, Jaime 
Escalante, hero of the film "Stand and Deliver." Escalante has achieved 
remarkable success in turning ill-prepared Latino students into skillful 
mathematicians. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve of his students won national attention in 1982 when they successfully 
passed a difficult Advanced Placement calculus retest after the Educational 
Testing Service accused them of cheating. 
</P>
<P>
After that episode, I became a Garfield habitue. I watched its unprecedented 
metamorphosis and came to accept what Escalante had been telling me: Much of 
the change would not have occurred without the principal's rare mix of 
sensitivity and pugnacity. 
</P>
<P>
Gradillas sharply reduced gang activity at the school. He cut back shop classes 
in favor of more algebra. He expanded the Advanced Placement program far beyond 
Escalante's calculus. In 1981, the year he became principal, 53 Garfield 
students took 54 AP examinations for college credit in four subjects. In 1987, 
shortly before he left, 234 Garfield students took 329 AP tests in 13 subjects. 
</P>
<P>
District officials have recently said that they always wanted to find a good 
job for Gradillas and were stymied by unavoidable delays. But that is not what 
Gradillas' colleagues at Garfield and some downtown admirers believe. One 
well-placed administrator told me that he personally heard the head of the 
district's new school-based management project rule out Gradillas as "too 
confrontational." 
</P>
<P>
Garfield teachers had concluded long ago that Gradillas was on someone's 
blacklist for making too many demands in support of Advanced Placement and 
other programs. Garfield AP coordinator John Bennett noticed that other 
principals with much feebler records were regularly promoted ahead of 
Gradillas. 
</P>
<P>
Garfield's achievements are unprecedented. No public high school with 
predominantly poor, minority students has ever produced so many successful 
Advanced Placement candidates, and only four high schools in the entire country 
produced more AP calculus students in 1987. Yet district officials, with a few 
exceptions, have done little to examine this phenomenon or spread the secrets 
of its success to other schools. 
</P>
<P>
Garfield's message suffers in part because no one high enough at district 
headquarters can honestly take credit for it. Many educators have also soured 
on trying to make one school's success work elsewhere. The Ford Foundation 
suffered embarrassing failures in pushing pilot-project reforms in the 1960s, 
and many veteran teachers and principals are understandably reluctant to try 
what looks like another media-touted cure-all. 
</P>
<P>
But there are signs that much of what Garfield did could work in other schools, 
when given more support. Sheila Smith, coordinator of the district's 
gifted/talented program and one of a few outspoken Garfield advocates downtown, 
noted that a program to encourage AP courses in disadvantaged schools had 
increased the number of AP exams in the district from 4,853 in 1984 to 7,619 in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Following Garfield's example requires a difficult suspension of disbelief. 
Escalante, Gradillas and other Garfield educators showed that young people with 
few books at home and poor academic records could still tackle college-level 
material. School board member Rita Walters noted with chagrin that "people I 
know, good people, simply cannot believe that." 
</P>
<P>
That explains why people like Henry Gradillas who preach the gospel of tough 
courses for poor kids are both so valuable and so vulnerable to the 
bureaucrat's distaste for anyone who speaks out of turn.

IT'S AMERICA'S TURN TO SHIFT THINKING; 
</P>
<P>
WHILE TALKING WITH PLO, U.S. MUST SKIRT DETOURS BY ISRAEL, FRIENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RASHID KHALIDI, Rashid Khalidi is the associate director of the Center for 
Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Chicago. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The much-heralded opening of contacts between the United States and the 
Palestine Liberation Organization made fewer waves than might have been 
expected. Indeed, it can now be seen that the enormous energy invested in this 
relatively minor issue blew it entirely out of proportion. In the cold light of 
morning, all parties can perceive that it was not quite what they expected. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of these contacts here and in Israel will perhaps now accept that 
talking to a given party does not necessarily mean embracing its every 
principle, tenet and belief. Those in the PLO who favored these contacts may 
now understand that they have a long way to go before they can agree on much 
with the United States, let alone Israel. And all must realize that there is a 
long, hard road ahead before any progress can be made on the substantive issues 
of a Middle East settlement that were shelved over the many years while this 
farce was being played out. 
</P>
<P>
A few important things have happened, nevertheless. The most notable is that 
the lengthy campaign to demonize the PLO and put it outside the pale of 
civilized discourse has finally failed. Israeli diplomacy under the new team of 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens and Deputy Foreign 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- representing the hardest line of Israeli hawks 
-- will undoubtedly try to resurrect it. But it is beyond resuscitation, 
interred by the actions of Israel over the past year of the Palestinian 
uprising, which has shown Americans that the Palestinians are a people who 
deserve to be free and independent. 
</P>
<P>
This change is rooted in an underlying shift in public opinion in this country, 
notably among the American Jewish community. After decades of seeing reality in 
the Middle East through Israeli lenses, Americans are beginning to see things 
for themselves. And, not surprisingly, the reality that they perceive is far 
more complex than before. This relates in part to the Palestinian uprising, but 
it began with the seemingly endless Israeli siege of Beirut during the summer 
of 1982. The Lebanon war had a powerful effect on public opinion, preparing it 
for the ugly images from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip five years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that there has been such a shift in American opinion, of course, does 
not mean that it cannot be reversed. Those who oppose contacts with the PLO may 
well try to exploit an incident instigated by Arab opponents of the settlement 
process -- the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 may prove to be just such an 
incident. With the hard-line Likud team well connected with influential 
commentators like William Safire, George F. Will, A. M. Rosenthal and Jeane 
Kirkpatrick, it is easy to envisage the outlines of such a counteroffensive. It 
would be yet another instance of the old Middle East pattern of the extremes, 
in effect, cooperating against the center. 
</P>
<P>
Yet another pitfall to be avoided is that of seeking a substitute for the 
Palestinians' own representatives. It is already clear that the "new" Likud 
peace plan will include several varieties of this old ploy. Whatever the 
ostensible objective, the aim is to avoid dealing with the real protagonist on 
the other side. Behind this lies the desire to avoid substantive negotiations 
about Israeli withdrawal, removal of settlements, Palestinian 
self-determination and a freely negotiated status for Jerusalem -- all 
anathemas to Likud. 
</P>
<P>
The danger is not that the new Likud foreign-policy team will put forth such a 
meaningless plan, but that the United States will fail to bluntly label such an 
approach a non-starter. If the Bush Adminstration handles whatever warmed-over 
ideas are produced by Jerusalem with the kid gloves customarily reserved for 
America's reception of Israeli proposals, the peace process will be in serious 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
But more than American frankness with Israel is necessary if the peace process 
is not to stall at this early stage. The United States must also accept that it 
cannot single-handedly resolve the longest-lasting, most intractable and most 
many-sided of the world's regional conflicts. Cooperation over this matter is 
essential at least between the superpowers, for if a settlement is to be 
lasting and credible to all parties it must involve the guarantees, and perhaps 
the peacekeeping forces, of both Washington and Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the United States must listen with an open mind to what Palestinians 
say when contacts with the PLO resume late this month, and it must take a fair 
but firm attitude toward Israel. After being ignored as a serious party to the 
conflict for so many years, the PLO deserves a hearing for its peace proposals. 
If the Palestinians can modify their long-cherished ideas, the Americans should 
be able to do the same. As for Israel, the old days of indulging its every whim 
should be over. There is no consensus in this country for forcing Israel to do 
things that it refuses to do. But there is one for no longer acquiescing in and 
subsidizing Israeli actions that are harmful to U.S. interests and that most 
Americans find abhorrent. Any other course of action would sabotage the 
prospects for peace and further damage U.S. credibility.

BORDER DEATHS OF 4 LABELED UNPARALLELED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The New Year's weekend deaths of four members of a San Joaquin Valley family 
who apparently succumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning while awaiting entry into 
the United States resulted from a freak accident that is apparently 
unprecedented along the U.S.-Mexico border, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The four were discovered unconscious shortly after midnight Monday in the back 
of a pickup truck, equipped with a camper shell, that had waited more than 
three hours to enter the United States via the crossing at Calexico, 100 miles 
east of San Diego. The camper's windows were shut but there were rust holes in 
the pickup's bed, said authorities, who theorized that the deadly gas -- a 
byproduct of gasoline combustion -- may have entered through the holes or via a 
malfunctioning exhaust system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heat Stroke More Common 
</P>
<P>
While occasional illnesses have been attributed to carbon monoxide at border 
posts, where lines of idling vehicles are a frequent sight, authorities said 
they could remember no other fatalities. Heat stroke victims are more 
commonplace, but deaths at the border lines are rare, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We checked all around the border, and no one can ever recall this happening 
before," said Edward Kelliher, assistant district director for the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible tragedy, but it's a fluke," said Maryanne Noonan, a 
spokeswoman with the U.S. Customs Service in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
However, two children were found unconscious, suffering from carbon monoxide 
poisoning, in the back of another pickup at Calexico fewer than 90 minutes 
after the fatal accident, U.S. Customs officers reported. The two, Angelica 
Ortega, 11, and Armando Ortea, 12, of the Imperial County community of Niland, 
were revived in time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Short of Inspectors 
</P>
<P>
The long delays at Calexico, San Ysidro and other crossings, officials said, 
were caused by the usual holiday weekend traffic crush now exacerbated by an 
influx of newly legalized amnesty recipients who were returning from visits to 
relatives south of the border. 
</P>
<P>
The INS acknowledged that it was short two inspectors due to illness when the 
deaths occurred at Calexico, but Kelliher minimized the importances of the 
absences, contending that the delays would have been substantial even if the 
border station had been fully staffed. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe instead of a 3-hour wait, there would have been a 2-hour wait," Kelliher 
said, noting that Calexico can only accommodate 8 lanes of traffic, most of 
which were open all of the time. "With carbon monoxide, you could be poisoned 
in 20 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
While carbon monoxide poisoning is strongly suspected in the deaths, 
authorities are scheduled to perform autopsies today, said Imperial County 
Sheriff's Deputy Sharon Housouer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Unfortunate Accident' 
</P>
<P>
Calexico police are treating the case as "an unfortunate accident," said Sgt. 
Paul Bugarin. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the vehicle, Horacio Aguilar, 36, who was unhurt, was described 
as disconsolate after losing his wife, Micaela Iniguez Aguilar, 26, and 3 
children -- Horacio Aguilar, 6, Francisco Javier, 4, and Camilio, 3. The four, 
residents of the Fresno County town of Laton, were returning home after 
visiting relatives in Mexicali, officials said.

FOUR KILLED WHEN TRUCK FLIPS ONTO CAR NEAR DULZURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four people were killed Tuesday on California 94 east of Dulzura when a 
tractor-trailer toppled onto an automobile, the California Highway Patrol 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
A CHP spokesman said the crash occurred at 4:30 p.m. between Otay Lakes Road 
and Barrett Junction in the westbound lane. Details of the accident were still 
sketchy at 9 p.m. A spokesman for the San Diego County coroner's office said 
the victims' bodies were still at the scene 4 1/2 hours after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
The identities of the victims were not known, and it was not known whether all 
of the dead were inside the car, which was crushed by the truck. Neither the 
condition or name of the truck driver was immediately available. CHP officers 
said they were still investigating the cause of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, CHP officers kept one lane open for traffic. But at 8 p.m. they 
closed a 13-mile stretch of California 94 from Otay Lakes Road to California 
188 as emergency crews worked to lift the trailer off the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
California 188 runs south from California 94 to the Mexican border at Tecate.

Councilman Hal Bernson on Tuesday asked the Los Angeles City Council to 
temporarily ban certain businesses -- including motels, thrift shops and 
auto-related firms -- from Chatsworth's main commercial strip. 
</P>
<P>
His proposal would impose tighter controls on building heights, design, 
landscaping, parking and signs on Devonshire Street between De Soto Avenue and 
Topanga Canyon Boulevard, and on a short stretch of Topanga Canyon south of 
Devonshire. 
</P>
<P>
It would temporarily prohibit development of businesses that would better fit 
into industrial areas, said Ralph Crouch, planning deputy to Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Due for Vote Tuesday 
</P>
<P>
Bernson's proposal, which will come before the council for a vote Tuesday, 
would set the wheels in motion for city planners to recommend specific 
restrictions. Their recommendations would be the subject of public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions would remain in effect for a year or until the council 
approves a new development plan for the area. The plan, which seeks to 
transform the area in a fashionable shopping district, is expected to be 
finished in a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to upgrade it into a desirable commercial area rather than a catch-all 
for everything," Bernson said. He introduced his proposal at the request of a 
citizens advisory committee that he appointed to prepare a development plan for 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
The council recently enacted similar controls for the Reseda business district 
at the behest of Councilwoman Joy Picus.

DENNIS GREEN TAKES STANFORD JOB; 
</P>
<P>
49ER ASSISTANT IS PAC-10'S FIRST BLACK HEAD FOOTBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Dennis Green, an assistant coach for the San Francisco 49ers, was named to 
succeed the fired Jack Elway at Stanford Tuesday, becoming the first black head 
football coach in the Pacific 10 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always felt a part of Stanford," said Green, 39, who served 3 years as a 
Cardinal assistant before becoming the head coach at Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
Green told reporters that he will remain with the 49ers through the NFC 
championship game Sunday against the Chicago Bears and, if San Francisco wins, 
the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Green also said he feels no added pressure being the Pac-10's first black head 
football coach because he also was the first in the Big Ten when he was at 
Northwestern in 1981-85. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always looked at myself as a football coach who happens to be black," he 
said in a telephone interview. "I've never looked at myself as a black coach 
and I don't think the players look at me that way, either. I think they just 
want somebody to do the job. I don't think it will get you a job, and I hope it 
won't keep you from getting a job. (The interest) will wear off. But I don't 
have any problems with answering that type of question. I think people are 
interested." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford Athletic Director Andy Geiger said he is aware that because Green is 
black, there will be suggestions that race is Green's primary selling point. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was a consideration, it was a positive consideration," Geiger said. 
"It's an issue that's with us today in this country. You can read story after 
story and read about the absence of black people in significant positions. 
Dennis was the most qualified candidate, anyway. (But) if you have a chance, 
you want to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Green will be in transition as long as the 49ers stay in contention for the 
Super Bowl at Miami Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
"I will be wearing two hats," he said. "Bill (Walsh, 49er head coach) has 
convinced me I have to jump into the Stanford job. I'll also do my best to take 
the 49ers to the next step." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh has been both a mentor and an advocate for Green. Walsh has reportedly 
mentioned Green's name for several National Football League jobs, and Geiger 
said he spoke with Walsh several times about Green. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me many good things but mainly this," Geiger said. "Fundamentals: he 
is absolutely grounded in the fundamentals of the game. And the other thing is 
management. Bill Walsh said Dennis would make an excellent manager and 
administrator. Dennis is ready to run this football program." 
</P>
<P>
Elway was fired Dec. 5, after the Cardinal finished the season at 3-6-2, having 
lost several close games in the final seconds. Elway was criticized for not 
bringing out what was said to be a great deal of talent. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal had losing records in 4 of Elway's 5 seasons, and he was 25-29-2 
overall. The winning season was in 1984, when Stanford went 8-4 and lost to 
Clemson in the Gator Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Green said he hopes to revive Stanford's football tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think a lot of the players are even aware of the tradition here of 
going to bowl games, and the All-Americans," he said. "I think tradition is the 
single most important element of recruiting." 
</P>
<P>
Geiger said, when asked what set Green apart from other candidates: "He is 
unique in his variety of experience. He has an excellent grounding in terms of 
role models and who he was associated with in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps the most salient point to me is that he will be a good administrator 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Green declined to comment on terms of his contract, other than to describe them 
as "very equitable." 
</P>
<P>
On his coaching philosophy, Green said, "I believe in the student-athlete, and 
Stanford's tradition in that area." 
</P>
<P>
Geiger said that Green's tenure at Northwestern, which shares Stanford's high 
academic standards for athletes, proved he can coach in such an environment. 
"Integrity is a big part of him," Geiger said. 
</P>
<P>
Green, with the 49ers since 1986, was a Stanford assistant under Walsh in 
1977-78, seasons after which the Cardinal won in the Sun Bowl and Bluebonnet 
Bowl, respectively. Green returned to Stanford as offensive coordinator in 1980 
when the team finished 6-5 under Paul Wiggin. 
</P>
<P>
He had a 10-45 record in 5 seasons at Northwestern. Green was named Big Ten 
coach of the year in 1982 when the Wildcats finished 3-8 and broke a 34-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
As a player, he was a starting tailback at the University of Iowa and later 
played for the British Columbia Lions of the Canadian Football League in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Green is free to name his own staff. All of Elway's eight assistants remain. 
Geiger said Green would consider them as well as coaches on the 49er staff. 
Appointments may be made as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
"I've talked to quite a few coaches, but I don't believe you need eight 
assistant coaches right now," Green said. "My No. 1 objective right now is not 
recruiting, but it's the players who are here now. I have to get them together 
and talk to them about my philosophy as a head coach and what my assistant 
coaches will expect from them." 
</P>
<P>
Green wasted no time in getting to work. He spent Tuesday in the Stanford 
football offices calling as many as 30 recruits. 
</P>
<P>
Geiger said his search committee made an initial list of 12-15 candidates. Only 
four were called back for a second interview. Green and Pete Carroll, coach of 
the Minnesota Vikings' defensive backs, were considered the strongest 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Green's name surfaced as a possible candidate for the Raiders' head coaching 
job last season, but he was not thought to be strongly considered. 
</P>
<P>
"I've interviewed for jobs in the NFL," Green said. "That part of my future is 
now over. That is no longer a goal for me. I will not be a head coach in the 
NFL."

Notre Dame was proclaimed national collegiate football champion on all fronts 
Tuesday, less than 24 hours after beating previously undefeated West Virginia, 
34-21, in the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish (12-0), ranked No. 1 for the final 6 weeks of the regular 
season, received 58 1/2 first-place votes and 1,198 1/2 of a possible 1,200 
points from a nationwide panel of 60 sportswriters and sportscasters in the 
Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
Miami (11-1), the 1987 national champion whose only loss was at Notre Dame, 
31-30, in October, finished second with 1 1/2 first-place votes and 1,141 1/2 
points, followed by Florida State (11-1), Michigan (9-2-1) and West Virginia 
(11-1). 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (10-2) wound up sixth after downing Arkansas, 17-3, in the Cotton Bowl, 
while USC (10-2) was seventh after losing to Michigan, 22-14, in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The annual Kickoff game, staged in late August or early September at Giants 
Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., would like to match Notre Dame with UCLA, but 
both schools have had lukewarm responses. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish also were the unanimous choice of the National Football Foundation 
and Hall of Fame's 12-man committee as winner of the MacArthur Bowl, emblematic 
of the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Notre Dame won the Football Writers Assn. of America's Grantland 
Rice National Championship Trophy. The Irish were the unanimous choice of a 
5-man committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning the national championship was never in my thoughts," Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, you dream about it. But I never really thought that it would happen to 
me. I never thought I would coach a national championship team. It still hasn't 
sunk in on me yet." 
</P>
<P>
Holtz was unhappy with only one aspect of Notre Dame's Fiesta Bowl victory -- 
the penalties the Irish received for unsportsmanlike conduct. 
</P>
<P>
When Holtz came on the field to calm his players late in the game, he was also 
hit with a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"I think late in the game we got away from some of the things we believe in," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame, which finished 17th a year ago, was No. 13 in the preseason AP 
poll. The Irish jumped to No. 8 by opening with a 19-17 victory over Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish climbed to second before taking over the No. 1 spot after top-ranked 
UCLA lost to Washington State on Oct. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the AP Top 10 are Auburn, Clemson and Nebraska. The Second 10 
consists of Oklahoma State, Arkansas, Syracuse, Oklahoma, Georgia, Washington 
State, Alabama, Houston, LSU and Indiana.

MIKE DOWNEY: RILEY NOT SORRY ROLE GOT AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey

<TEXT>
<P>
Mel Gibson appears in the new motion picture, "Tequila Sunrise," as a drug 
dealer who may or may not have reformed. Michelle Pfeiffer co-stars as a 
restaurant owner who eventually waits on a couple of her customers hand and 
foot, and all else in between. 
</P>
<P>
A third party in this love triangle is Kurt Russell, who plays an L.A. County 
police lieutenant decked out in custom-made suits, white-on-white shirts, 
small-knotted neckties and a haircut that is slicked straight back with some 
sort of Brylcreem or Vitalis or Dippity Do. Recently I went to see this movie, 
mostly to watch Russell. My women friends went to check out Mel, and most of my 
men friends preferred Michelle. But me, I went to see Kurt. I did this as soon 
as I discovered that the part of the cop was written for -- and offered to -- 
mister slicked-back himself, Laker Coach Pat Riley. 
</P>
<P>
True or false? 
</P>
<P>
"True," Riley concedes. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Towne, the man we have to thank for the screenplay to "Chinatown" and 
the women's-track story, "Personal Best," went to the Forum a few years ago as 
a guest of Laker boss Jerry Buss. Towne was introduced to Riley, a man who 
already had made transitions from player to assistant coach to broadcaster to 
head coach, all roles he played for Hollywood's favorite team. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me what he was planning to do, that he'd been watching me, sort of 
visualizing my character," Riley recalls. "The character was also based on a 
guy he knew a long time ago, a guy who was San Pedro chief of police in the 
'50s, a guy who dressed like me and wore his hair slicked back, same way I do." 
</P>
<P>
The part of Nick the narc eventually evolved into a guy who is torn by his 
sworn professional duty and his Redondo Beach boyhood friendship with Mac, the 
drug dealer, while the restaurateur gets ensnared in a romantic tug of war. 
There were, Riley recalls, some pretty hot scenes between "his" character and 
Michelle Pfeiffer's in the original script. And the part was Pat's if he wanted 
it. 
</P>
<P>
He declined. 
</P>
<P>
And here I always thought Pat Riley was one bright dude. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all," he explains, "I was just starting out as a coach. I didn't have 
much credibility. It was very flattering, but no, I couldn't have done it. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't mean I wouldn't do it 5 years from now, when I'm out of 
(coaching)." 
</P>
<P>
Being Hollywood's coach, handsome, popular, successful, cool, Riley has been 
offered a number of acting opportunities over the last few years, but says he 
has never responded to any. Unlike Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who squeezed in 
"Airplane!" and other films during his free time, Riley does not intend to mix 
two careers at once, saying, "I just think there's a certain decorum that a 
coach has to maintain." 
</P>
<P>
Does he see "Tequila Sunrise" and wonder what sort of job he would have done 
with Kurt Russell's part? 
</P>
<P>
"No," Riley says. "He plays me better than I can play me." 
</P>
<P>
And yet, it turns out that Pat Riley does know his way around a Hollywood stage 
as well as a hardwood court. During his broadcasting days, while also taking 
communications and speech courses at USC, Riley signed up for the popular 
character actor and acting teacher Jeff Corey's drama classes, to cultivate 
self-confidence and poise, and just to see how he would do. 
</P>
<P>
While there, Riley acted out scenes from plays and films. He did Mel, the Jack 
Lemmon role, from Neil Simon's "Prisoner of Second Avenue." He took instruction 
from Corey, stood his ground while the teacher attempted to see if he could 
shake the neophyte actor from his concentration, as when he loudly flung a 
trash can onto the stage right in the middle of Riley's lines. 
</P>
<P>
"He really tried to distract me," Riley says. "One time he put five women up on 
the stage while I was reading something, and had them wrap themselves around my 
legs. Try saying your lines with that going on sometime." 
</P>
<P>
Riley does think he will try his luck at a movie bit someday, if somebody will 
have him. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I am trying to picture him in the following roles: As a Western 
sheriff. (Nah. Can't see the hair.) As a private eye. (Have to wear older 
clothes.) As a rock star. (With hair to his shoulders. And an earring, maybe.) 
As the love interest of Goldie Hawn. (Sorry, Russell. Fair's fair.) Or how 
about one of those horror movies, with Riley either as the slasher or the 
slashee? 
</P>
<P>
Just to determine his preferences, I ask Riley what his favorite movie is, 
which videocassette he would take to a deserted island if he could only take 
one, and if the island just happened to have a VCR. 
</P>
<P>
"Hmmm. I guess 'The Wild One,' " Riley says. 
</P>
<P>
You mean the one with Marlon Brando in a motorcycle gang? The one in which, 
when someone asks Brando what he's rebelling against, he asks, "Whaddaya got?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Riley says, riding an imaginary bike. "Vrrrrrooooom. I remember the 
Harley." 
</P>
<P>
I have to be honest here: I can picture Pat Riley as many things, but not as a 
Hell's Angel. Anyway, I hope he gets the girl. As Hollywood's coach, he 
certainly gets women's attention. Teri Garr once said during the election 
campaigns that her personal choice for President of the United States was Pat 
Riley. Joan Van Ark from "Knots Landing" last month was quoted that in her 
Christmas stocking she would like to find Pat Riley. 
</P>
<P>
Lucky guy. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, the Kurt Russell part originally called for a pretty passionate 
scene between him and Michelle Pfeiffer," Riley says. "I couldn't have done 
that." 
</P>
<P>
"Because of your own principles or because of the trouble it would cause you at 
home?" I ask Chris Riley's husband. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of my own principles," Riley says. "Well, maybe both." 
</P>
<P>
Well, there you have it. Pat Riley, PG-13.

FIESTA BOWL HAD TV EDGE NATIONALLY, BUT ROSE BOWL WAS BIG WINNER IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Preliminary indications are that more television viewers nationally watched 
Monday's Fiesta Bowl, in which No. 1 Notre Dame defeated No. 3 West Virginia, 
34-21, than watched the Rose Bowl, in which Michigan beat USC, 22-14. But the 
gap was not as large as many had expected, and in Los Angeles, the Rose Bowl 
was a big winner. 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl drew an average Nielsen rating of 26 in L.A., compared to an 8.8 
for the Fiesta. The Rose Bowl started out with an 18.4 rating and peaked at a 
32 late in the game. The Fiesta peaked early at 13.1 and had only a 6.8 in the 
last quarter-hour. 
</P>
<P>
The Fiesta Bowl's average overnight rating for the nation's 17 largest markets 
was a 15; the Rose Bowl, which started a half-hour later, drew a 12.7 
</P>
<P>
Other overnight bowl ratings for the 17 major markets: Orange, 11.2; Cotton, 
10.2; Sugar, 7.6; Hall of Fame, 7.1, and Florida Citrus, 6.3. 
</P>
<P>
Final national ratings won't be available until later this week or early next 
week. LARRY STEWART

PRO FOOTBALL / BOB OATES; 
</P>
<P>
WALSH IS LEAST APPRECIATED IN HOMETOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bob Oates 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the ironies of the 1980s is that Bill Walsh, the 49er coach, has been so 
widely unappreciated in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Although his teams have won two Super Bowls and more regular-season games in 
this decade than any other National Football League club, Bay Area fans seem to 
focus on 49er failures. 
</P>
<P>
This has Walsh thinking of retiring -- or at least leaving town -- after 
another division-winning performance this season, an achievement that the 49ers 
followed with a 34-9 playoff victory over Minnesota on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
They will play the Bears in Chicago Sunday for the National Football Conference 
title and a place in Super Bowl XXIII against the champion of the American 
Football Conference, Cincinnati or Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
In an era of increasing parity, Walsh keeps demonstrating that he remains 
perhaps the most shrewd and probably the best of the nation's football coaches. 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, is harder to prove to everyone in the 1980s than it was in, 
say, the 1960s, when Vince Lombardi coached football's dominant team, the Green 
Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
There is so much power in the NFL today -- so many clever defensive teams and 
so many effective passing attacks -- that it has become impossible for Super 
Bowl champions to repeat. 
</P>
<P>
Lombardi's place at the top is secure, and Walsh's is still insecure even in 
San Francisco, but the difference is largely a difference of eras. Walsh is 
winning in tougher times. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana's 3 touchdown passes to Jerry Rice knocked Minnesota out of the 
playoffs Sunday. How much of that was 49er talent and how much 49er coaching? 
</P>
<P>
Here are some evolutionary facts: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the 1970s and early '80s, the NFL, influenced by the old American 
Football League, was a zone-defense league. This eventually forced the game's 
offensive coaches to develop zone-type pass patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When Philadelphia Coach Buddy Ryan reintroduced heavy blitzing in 1985, his 
last year as Chicago's defensive coach, he also brought back man-to-man pass 
defenses. Still, the NFL's offensive coaches tended to stay with the pass 
patterns that had worked so well against zone defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Walsh countered Minnesota's Bear-type blitz with a new series of man-to-man 
patterns that enabled Rice to outmaneuver some of the league's best defensive 
backs -- including the Vikings' Pro Bowl cornerback, Carl Lee -- one on one. 
</P>
<P>
On one such play, Rice ran a post-square-out route to a touchdown. Lining up 
left that time, he slanted hard to his right, selling a single-covering 
Minnesota defensive back that he was en route to center field. 
</P>
<P>
Then Rice abruptly reined in and raced to his left, straight to the sideline. 
At the same time, Montana, after pretending to search for a receiver to his 
right, abruptly wheeled left and threw to Rice just before he sprinted out of 
bounds. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence is persuasive that in Candlestick Park, the team with the better 
coach outplayed the team that had the larger number of exceptional players. 
</P>
<P>
Bear Coach Mike Ditka, when informed that Chicago would be favored over San 
Francisco at Soldier Field Sunday, said: "It isn't the Bears who are favored, 
it's the weather." 
</P>
<P>
He had that right. On a pleasant day, the 49ers could be expected to strike 
with too much firepower for Ditka's injured team, but in the second week of 
January it isn't likely to be pleasant in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Bears turned back San Francisco 3 months ago, 10-9, these are now 
somewhat different teams. For two things, Rice has proved that he's well again, 
and Richard Dent hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
When sound, Dent, a Chicago end, is perhaps second in the NFL only to Chicago 
linebacker Mike Singletary as a defensive force. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears are still alive only because the Philadelphia Eagles self-destructed 
in a dense Soldier Field cloud Saturday, 20-12. 
</P>
<P>
On 10 possessions, the Eagles were inside the Chicago 25 and in position to 
score 70 points. On 5 possessions, they got inside the Bear 11. On 2, they were 
inside the 5. And they never made a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the Chicago defense that stopped them, it was Eagle playoff jitters, 
which led to critical penalties, dropped passes and other errors of execution 
by a young team. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, the Bears capitalized only twice on Philadelphia's surprisingly 
inept pass defense but two big plays were enough. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers will be tougher. 
</P>
<P>
In the AFC, the Cincinnati Bengals made the NFL's final four Saturday with a 
first half in which they looked like a pro football team should look. 
</P>
<P>
Before ousting Seattle, 21-13, the Bengals opened a 21-0 lead with brilliant 
no-huddle plays that were seldom hobbled by Seattle Coach Chuck Knox's 
fake-injury defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks faked their injuries only before third-down plays on a day when 
the Bengals drove to their 3 touchdowns on mostly second-down plays. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of Coach Sam Wyche's no-huddle offense in Cincinnati is to prevent 
situation substitutions by the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Knox's fakes were called to give him time to make such substitutions. 
Technically, faking injuries is illegal. But most pro athletes hold that all is 
fair in love or war or football. Or baseball. 
</P>
<P>
For example, most outfielders and most wide receivers routinely pretend that a 
trapped ball is a catch. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Knox got by with a novel defense for a day, which was the whole 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
He simply didn't have enough team under him. 
</P>
<P>
Wyche not only attacks with the most advanced offensive scheme in football, he 
does it with extraordinary blockers, backs and receivers. 
</P>
<P>
In Buffalo Sunday, the Houston Oilers -- like the Eagles on Saturday -- 
self-destructed. 
</P>
<P>
The difference was that leadership problems took Houston out of the playoffs, 
17-10, whereas young-team jitters had beaten Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jerry Glanville has both experience and talent on the Houston team -- 
more of either than Buffalo -- but on offense, the Oilers again used the 
league's best power personnel to play finesse football. 
</P>
<P>
And this time it cost them. 
</P>
<P>
With three or four Pro Bowl blockers and three fast, hard-running backs -- 
Alonzo Highsmith, Allen Pinckett and Mike Rozier -- the Oilers are ideally 
suited to run off tackle, around end and up the middle with either power plays 
or counter plays, or misdirection. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, in their basic scheme, they again lined up four receivers and called 
either long passes or draw plays and other fake passes. 
</P>
<P>
This wasn't good enough. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers also suffered a blocked punt and a blocked field goal -- another 
sign of leadership problems. Kicks are seldom blocked in well run 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Worst of all, Houston lost a touchdown on an option misplay, a wild lateral. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that the option doesn't belong in the NFL. There isn't enough time 
in a practice week for a pro team to polish, along with everything else, option 
plays. Or wishbone plays of the kind Indianapolis uses. 
</P>
<P>
Houston's only weakness is a rather weak pass rush. And speaking of leadership 
as a factor in football, Buffalo Coach Marv Levy, obviously aware of the one 
Oiler trouble area, came out throwing with Jim Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
Using passes to set up runs, the Bills scored just often enough to win.

SNEVA NAMED TO REPLACE GUERRERO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Sneva, two-time Championship Auto Racing Teams Indy car driving champion 
and winner of the 1983 Indianapolis 500, has been named to replace Roberto 
Guerrero as No. 1 driver for Vince Granatelli's racing team. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero was released from his 2-year contract with Granatelli to join an Indy 
car team being put together by Alfa Romeo of Italy in time to run in the Indy 
500 on May 27. 
</P>
<P>
Sneva, 40, who drove in only two races last year after being dropped from the 
Mike Curb team late in the 1987 season, will complete the team's hometown 
Phoenix flavor. Sneva lives in Paradise Valley, Granatelli in Scottsdale -- 
both Phoenix suburbs -- and the racing shop is in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"We hated to lose Roberto, but he felt it was an . . . opportunity that he 
couldn't pass up," Granatelli said. Guerrero, a Colombian native who lives in 
San Clemente, was with Granatelli for 2 years, during which he suffered a 
serious head injury in 1987 while testing at Indianapolis. He recuperated and 
celebrated his return to racing with a second-place finish in the 1988 season 
opener at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"With Sneva, we have an ideal situation, especially for testing," Granatelli 
said. "He lives near our shop, he can test at the two local tracks (Phoenix 
International Raceway, site of the CART season opener April 9, and Firebird 
Raceway, a road course in nearby Chandler) with no travel problems, and we can 
go to and from the races as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Granatelli will also have a new engine, switching to a Buick V-6 from last 
year's Cosworth DFX, and perhaps a new chassis, a Lola T8900. 
</P>
<P>
"We have already run the Buick in tests and believe it will be very competitive 
at Indianapolis," Granatelli said. "There, the push-rod engine gets 55 inches 
of (manifold) boost, instead of only the 45 it is allowed in CART races. We 
don't think that is a fair balance, but we hope a development program can keep 
us in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Indy 500 rules are set by the United States Auto Club, whereas rules in all 
other races of the PPG Indy Car World Series are set by CART. 
</P>
<P>
Granatelli has two new '89 model Lolas on order, plus two '88 Lolas and two '87 
March chassis in the shop. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no guarantee that just because a car is new that it's going to be 
faster," Granatelli said. "We'll have Tom run them all and decide what we feel 
is the best for whatever track we're racing next." 
</P>
<P>
Sneva won consecutive national championships in 1977 and 1978 with Roger 
Penske's team but when he failed to win a race in 1978 -- even though he won 
the championship -- he was dropped by Penske. He won the 1983 Indy 500 driving 
for Dan Cotter and George Bignotti. 
</P>
<P>
In 197 Indy car starts Sneva has won 13, finished in the top five 74 times and 
in the top 10 109 times. He most recently won the 1984 Las Vegas 200. Four of 
his 13 wins have been at Phoenix International Raceway.

A LONG-RANGER HAS A BIG CATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego's long-range sportsfishing fleet, which began its traditional 
schedule of 16-day trips south in search of giant yellowfin tuna on the day 
after Christmas, is still at sea. 
</P>
<P>
But the Royal Polaris got a taste of the action early, having returned from the 
islands off southern Mexico just before Christmas. Although the boat didn't 
find the giant yellowfin -- the fish are known to grow beyond 300 pounds -- 
sometimes associated with such trips, the 30 fishermen aboard did have a 
memorable outing. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 576 yellowfins were caught, though none topped the 200-pound mark, 
along with 127 wahoo, 1 black marlin, 66 groupers, 5 rainbow runners and 11 
dorado. 
</P>
<P>
The top fish was a 172.4-pound yellowfin caught by Greg Mayer, a visitor from 
New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Searcher, on a scheduled 9-day trip, returned from the Alijos 
Rocks off Baja California 2 days early on Monday because its fish hold was 
full. 
</P>
<P>
There were 22 anglers aboard who caught 440 yellowfins. The largest was a 
91.2-pounder caught by Lloyd Doyle of Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing in the waters off San Diego will improve somewhat in the near future if 
2 fish aggregating devices do what they are supposed to do when they are 
deployed later this year. 
</P>
<P>
The FADs, each of which is composed of 90 strands of polypropylene fronds 
attached to a chain under a buoy anchored to the ocean's bottom, will be put in 
3,000 feet of water 15 miles west of Mission Bay and at 300 feet 5 miles west 
of Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
John Hall, the principal investigator for the Sea World Research Institute's 
project, said the FADs differ from artificial reefs in that they are meant to 
attract fish seasonally, rather than a resident population of bottom fish. 
</P>
<P>
The strands are situated on the upper 90 feet of chain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like a city where fish move in and stay," Hall said. "These fish are 
expected to come and go on a seasonal basis." 
</P>
<P>
Hall said he expects bait fish such as anchovies to be the first to school near 
the devices, within 30 days of deployment, which is tentatively scheduled for 
early March. Eventually, Hall says, the FADs will attract such game fish as 
bonito, barracuda, yellowtail, dorado and even albacore. 
</P>
<P>
Anchored fish aggregating devices were first used by Philippine fishermen 
before World War II, and more than 1,000 are in use in the Pacific and Indian 
oceans. 
</P>
<P>
Hall says the vast majority of commercial tuna caught in the western Pacific 
and Indian oceans are taken by setting nets near such devices. In Hawaii, FADs 
are yielding about 240 pounds of fish per boat, per visit, to recreational 
fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
Theories as to why fish are attracted to such devices range from the shelter 
and shade they provide, to their function as a schooling companion for 
migratory fish, to their being a simple reference point in a trackless sea.

SETON HALL KNOCKS OFF GEORGETOWN, 94-86 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After living by its man-to-man defense this season, Seton Hall unveiled an 
aggressive zone defense against No. 5-ranked Georgetown in a Big East game 
Tuesday night at the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first time all year we went zone," forward Daryll Walker said after 
No. 10 Seton Hall rallied from 9 points back to beat previously unbeaten 
Georgetown, 94-86. "I think we matched up pretty well and took (Alonzo) 
Mourning out of the game with it." 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates went to the 3-2 zone with about 12 minutes to play and Georgetown 
clinging to a 63-60 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"The timing of going to the zone was good," Georgetown Coach John Thompson 
said. "It was a smart thing on their art to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Greene hit a 3-point shot to ignite a 19-9 burst late in the second half 
that carried Seton Hall (13-0) to victory over Georgetown (9-1) before the 
largest crowd ever to watch a college basketball game in Brendan Byrne Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The battle between the two Big East Conference unbeaten teams drew 19,761, 
breaking both the regular-season arena mark of 18,116 for the North 
Carolina-Kentucky game on Dec. 26, 1981 and the postseason mark of 19,633 for 
the 1988 NCAA East Regional final when Duke beat Temple. 
</P>
<P>
Mourning finished with 18 points, 8 rebounds and 8 blocked shots against Seton 
Hall. The 8 blocks give him 60 for the season. The NCAA record is 207 by Navy's 
David Robinson in 35 games in 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't go out and look for blocked shots," said Mourning who once blocked 25 
shots in an AAU tournament game. "If it's there I go get it. As I've said 
before blocking shots is a God-given talent. Larry Bird and Michael Jordan have 
exceptional all-around games and that's God-given talent. Blocking shots is the 
God-given talent to me." 
</P>
<P>
Kansas 115, Brown 45 -- Milt Newton scored 23 points as the 18th-ranked 
Jayhawks broke a 76-year-old record for largest margin of victory by beating 
the Bruins in a non-conference game at Lawrence, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas' largest previous victory was 68-8 over Washington University of St. 
Louis in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas (11-1) led by as many as 74 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't think we were going to cream them," Milt Newton said. "We were just 
trying to execute the things we need to do to beat the good teams." 
</P>
<P>
Brown (4-6) made just 18 of 67 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Duke 87, Washington 61 -- John Smith scored 17 points as the top-ranked Blue 
Devils defeated the Huskies at Seattle for their ninth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Ferry scored 16 points for Duke, and Chris Laettner added 13. 
</P>
<P>
Eldridge Recasner and Dion Brown scored 15 each for Washington (3-7), which 
lost its fifth straight. West scored 13. 
</P>
<P>
Duke took a 17-6 lead behind a 13-2 spurt over 3:31 of the first half. The Blue 
Devils led, 19-12, when Brown was charged with his third foul with 8:18 gone. 
</P>
<P>
The unbeaten Blue Devils then stretched their lead to 31-17 with 6:53 left in 
the half. The Huskies closed to 35-30 and 37-32 before Ferry's 3-pointer at the 
first-half buzzer gave Duke a 40-32 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Providence 98, St. John's 69 -- Matt Palazzi scored 19 points as the unbeaten 
Friars overwhelmed the Redmen in a Big East game at Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
The Friars (11-0 overall and 2-0 in the league) never trailed in the game. St. 
Johns is 7-4 overall and 0-2 in the Big East. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame 60, Penn 55 -- Joe Fredrick scored 20 points, and the Fighting Irish 
beat the Quakers at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Jamere Jackson added 19 points for the Irish (5-1) including 6 straight free 
throws in the last 2 minutes to help hold off the Quakers. 
</P>
<P>
Tyrone Gilliams had 18 points and Hassan Duncombe added 16 for Penn (3-5). 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma 111, Sam Houston St. 66 -- Tony Martin scored a career-high 40 points 
at Norman, Okla., as the fourth-ranked Sooners went over 100 points for the 
ninth straight time. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, whose previous high was 19 last week against Texas, also had 17 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Stacey King missed his third straight game for the Sooners (11-1). He has an 
injured finger. 
</P>
<P>
Northwestern 83, Navy 60 -- Walker Lambiotte scored 21 points, and reserve Jeff 
Grose scored 13 of his 16 points in the first half, and the Wildcats downed the 
Middies at Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Schwabe scored 16 points for Northwestern (7-3) off to its best start 
under third-year coach Bill Foster. 
</P>
<P>
Navy (3-6) got 20 points from Eddie Reddick. 
</P>
<P>
Army 95, Cornell 79 -- Derrick Canada scored 22 points in the Cadets' win at 
West Point, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Army (5-5) never trailed after breaking a 24-24 tie midway through the first 
half.

CS FULLERTON LOSES TO NEW MEXICO STATE, 65-60 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Cal State Fullerton's Mark Hill hit a 3-point shot that cut New Mexico 
State's lead to 59-55 with 1:46 remaining Tuesday night, the situation looked 
good for Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a problem. The Titans, who had come from 13 points behind, had 
committed only 4 team fouls. 
</P>
<P>
Before Fullerton sent New Mexico State to the free-throw line, 53 seconds 
passed. The Aggies then made 6 of 6 shots from the line in the final minute, 
scoring a 65-60 victory before 1,603 fans at Titan Gym in the the Big West 
Conference opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
The foul situation presented a dilemma for Fullerton: 
</P>
<P>
The Titans could try for a steal, all the while letting time run off the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Or they could foul quickly to reach 7 team fouls, putting New Mexico State 
closer to the bonus, when it would have to go to the line. But with every foul, 
the Aggies got a new 45 seconds on the shot clock. 
</P>
<P>
"We got caught in a catch-22," Coach John Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Fullerton (5-5) rode the fence, trying for a steal for the first 
few passes and then fouling. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans had no luck either way. The Aggies protected the ball and hit their 
free throws, including 4 straight by Jimmy Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
The loss overshadowed a career-high 26-point performance by Hill, who tied a 
school record by making 6 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Hill made 8 of 12 shots, including 6 of 9 from 3-point range. He also made 4 of 
6 free throws as he led the Titans in scoring for the second game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Cedric Ceballos, who averaged 25 points in his first 7 games, finished with 12. 
He scored 2 and 16 points in his previous 2 games. 
</P>
<P>
Center John Sykes, returning after a 1-game suspension for unspecified reasons, 
scored 14 points, making all 6 field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the third in a row for New Mexico State, which is 8-3. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Joseph led the Aggies with 20 points, and Johnny Roberson added 15. 
</P>
<P>
"We had lost 3 and they still came back to play tough tonight," Sneed said. 
"That's a good sign." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton took a 7-4 lead on a 3-pointer by Mark Hill, but the Aggies went on a 
13-0 run to go ahead, 17-7, and led, 34-26 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
A 3-pointer by Taylor and a short jumper by Joseph at the start of the second 
half gave New Mexico State its biggest lead, 39-26. ROBYN NORWOOD

TARKANIAN WINS AGAIN IN AN OLD HAUNT, 97-76 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Returning to the Cal State Long Beach gym where he had never lost from 1968 to 
'73 as coach of the 49ers, Jerry Tarkanian won again Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember some great things about this gym," the Nevada Las Vegas coach said 
after the Runnin' Rebels defeated Long Beach, 97-76, in a Big West Conference 
game before a crowd of 1,889. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian had to wait awhile for his return to the place where he once won 34 
straight games. In recent seasons the two teams played at the Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
What he probably will remember most about Tuesday night's game will be the 
shooting of guard Anderson Hunt, who made 5 straight 3-point shots in the 
second half to break out of a slump and lead the Rebels, who improved to 8-2 
overall and 3-0 in the Big West. 
</P>
<P>
Going into the game, Hunt had made only 11 of 50 shots from 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been telling him every game to keep shooting," Tarkanian said. "Anderson 
is a great shooter." 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas led only 63-53 with 9:54 to play when Hunt got hot, and they had that 
margin mainly because of Long Beach's poor foul shooting. At that point, the 
49ers had made only 6 of 16 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
But 3 minutes later, following a run that included 4 of Hunt's long shots, the 
Rebels were up 78-56. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of the 12th-ranked Rebels quickly brought out the best in the 
49ers. Normally a 39% shooting team from the floor, Long Beach shot 57% in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we could have easily walked away at halftime with a tie if we had 
made our free throws," said Long Beach Coach Joe Harrington, whose team dropped 
to 3-7 and 0-1. 
</P>
<P>
With center John Hatten scoring 9 points in the first 5 minutes, Long Beach 
led, 15-13, until a 3-pointer by Clint Rossum put the Rebels ahead, 15-13. Long 
Beach was never in front again. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers tied the game at 20 but at halftime were down, 46-35. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense was terrible in the first half," Tarkanian said. "We kept getting 
beat individually, and our front line didn't come to play.." 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian, known for his devotion to the man-to-man defense, then switched 
successfully to a zone in the second half. Against it, Long Beach's shooting 
dropped to 46%. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't run our offense the way we normally run it, so it made their defense 
look a lot better," Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers' press, which bothered Las Vegas last season in 2 games the teams 
split, had little effect this time. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't bother us," Tarkanian said. 
</P>
<P>
That didn't surprise Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew they had a better team this year in the backcourt," Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt led Las Vegas with 21 points, while center David Butler had 18. 
</P>
<P>
Hatten scored 17 for the 49ers.

Quarterback Troy Aikman's outstanding performance in the Cotton Bowl virtually 
assured that he will be playing for the Cowboys next season. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Brandt, Dallas' chief scout, was beaming after Aikman led the Bruins to a 
17-3 victory over Arkansas Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The surest prediction now is that the Cowboys will make Aikman the first pick 
in the NFL draft this spring. 
</P>

"The Cowboys have lost some luster, and he (Aikman) will help us retain it," 
Brandt said. "He'll provide a little excitement to Dallas and Texas. I want him 
for my No. 1 pick and I think Coach Tom Landry will be easily convinced."

NEWSWIRE: MODELL WON'T RULE OUT HIRING TONY DUNGY AS HEAD COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Owner Art Modell of the Cleveland Browns said Tuesday he would not rule out 
hiring former Pittsburgh Steelers defensive coordinator Tony Dungy as the 
Browns' head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Dungy, 33, often mentioned as a candidate to become the National Football 
League's first black head coach, quit the Steelers Tuesday after four other 
Pittsburgh assistant coaches were fired. Chuck Noll remained as the Steelers' 
head coach and was given a lifetime contract by the club. 
</P>
<P>
"We think highly of Tony Dungy," Modell said. "We wouldn't rule him out." 
</P>
<P>
Modell has said previously he feels no pressure to hire a black head coach and 
would consider one "with Class A-1 credentials." 
</P>
<P>
"I won't hire a coach because he's black and I won't deny one because he's 
black," Modell said.

JONES' INJURY TRIGGERED NORTH HOLLYWOOD'S ILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dana Jones, the center for North Hollywood High's basketball team, is scheduled 
to return to the starting lineup when the Huskies play host to Grant in a 
Valley Pac-8 Conference opener Friday. 
</P>
<P>
For North Hollywood Coach Steve Miller, Jones' return comes none too soon. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies were 3-1 with the 6-foot, 6-inch Jones in the lineup but went 2-3 
after he chipped a bone and severely sprained his left wrist in an 89-87 loss 
to Gardena more than 3 weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
After beating teams such as Granada Hills (8-2) with Jones, the Huskies lost 
tournament games to Chatsworth and Poly without him and were trounced by 
Downey, 74-54, in the second round of the Bell-Jeff tournament. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood (5-4) then struggled to wins over Calabasas (66-63) and Oak 
Park (66-60) in the Bell-Jeff tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We're simply not the same team without Dana," Miller said. "Dana's a go-go 
type of player on offense and he protects the other guys on defense. With Dana 
in the post, there's someone we can go to. Without him, our inside game isn't 
very good." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said that several North Hollywood players were gambling defenders with 
Jones in the lineup because of his ability to swat shots. 
</P>
<P>
"They knew they could go for a steal with him there," Miller said. "If they 
missed, Dana would be there to cover up for them." 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who averaged 19 points, 12 rebounds and 5 assists a game before the 
injury, wore a cast for 3 weeks. It was removed last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm counting on him playing against Grant," Miller said. "He's been doing 
rehabilitative exercises since he got the cast off. Unless the wrist is still 
too weak, he'll play Friday." 
</P>
<P>
Men for all seasons: San Fernando is making maximum use of its football players 
now that the fall sport is a distant memory. 
</P>
<P>
In San Fernando's 87-65 win over Hart last week, junior forward Michael Wynn, 
an All-City Section quarterback, scored a season-high 25 points and added 11 
rebounds. Senior guard Sean Williams, an All-City and Times All-Valley 
receiver, scored 14 points and had 8 steals. 
</P>
<P>
Outside looking in: El Camino Real's weak spot was evident throughout the Las 
Vegas Holiday tournament: The team needed scoring from outside, points its 
guards have failed to deliver all season. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Reid and Jason Farrell are capable ballhandlers, but the starting guard 
tandem scored only 17 points in 3 tournament games, all losses. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody keeps telling us that if we had a good point guard -- a Division I, 
Cleveland-type point guard -- we'd be right there," El Camino Real assistant 
Jeff Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said that the team thought it had the answer in junior Todd Orlando, who 
showed flashes of brillance in summer league play. However, Coach Mike McNulty 
kicked Orlando off the team for disciplinary and academic reasons before the 
season started. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando, whose brother Damon, was suspended from the team last season, could 
have delivered the long-range threat. 
</P>
<P>
"He could stand out there and throw in the 3-pointers all night," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Said McNulty: "He has a lot of talent, but I'd rather play without him. We 
don't need the problems." 
</P>
<P>
Making his point: Calabasas sophomore Jason Young has stepped into the role of 
starting point guard with a flourish. In the 3 games since replacing Jamie 
Boyce, who broke his collarbone diving for a loose ball in the Thousand Oaks 
tournament, Young has averaged 17 points. His season average is 9.1. 
</P>
<P>
With Young at the point, the Coyotes won the consolation final of the Bell-Jeff 
tournament with a 56-46 win over Baldwin Park. 
</P>
<P>
Said Calabasas Coach David Hoffman, who felt that his team was treated unfairly 
in this space recently when it was suggested that the Coyotes played a soft 
schedule: "We played well against Baldwin Park, which has an enrollment of 
1,900, by the way."

CALAVITA COMES HOME AS TEAM'S STAR ATTRACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Rick Hazeltine 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't much of a homecoming for Joe Calavita, a center on the Vermont men's 
basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Calavita played at Crawford High School his junior year, but moved to 
Middlebury, Vt., his senior year and helped lead Middlebury Union to a 24-0 
record and the state championship. 
</P>
<P>
Calavita was back in town for games against San Diego State last Saturday and 
U.S. International University on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Vermont did not fare too well, losing both games to extend its losing streak to 
6 games. Calavita, the only senior starter and one of only two seniors on the 
team, scored 20 points against San Diego State and had 14 points and 5 rebounds 
against USIU. 
</P>
<P>
Calavita was a 6-foot 7-inch bean pole when he started as a forward for 
Crawford his junior year. But he filled out after his freshman year at Vermont 
and is now 6-11 and 240 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't getting looked at too much," Calavita said. "I was really skinny. 
Vermont was really the only team that went after me. 
</P>
<P>
"I was too skinny to play center at Crawford so I played forward, taking those 
15-foot shots." 
</P>
<P>
Calavita played every game as a freshman, averaging 2.3 points and 3.2 
rebounds, but blossomed as a sophomore with 11.8 points and 5.2 rebounds a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
His junior year, he became a dominant player in the North Atlantic Conference, 
averaging 20 points and 9.5 rebounds. He also set a conference tournament 
record when he scored 40 points against Niagara in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
After 6 games as a senior, Calavita was averaging 26.5 points and 7.5 rebounds. 
Then he suffered a stress fracture in his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
The injury ended a promising season for Calavita, who redshirted. He had been a 
preseason All-American and all-conference selection entering last season. This 
year, he was named an honorable mention All-American by Street &amp; Smith's 
magazine and the preseason conference player of the year by The Sporting News, 
which also listed him as a possible pick in the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Calavita leads the team with 16 points and 8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego State women's basketball team is having one of its finest 
seasons, with a 10-0 record after defeating Missouri, 97-75, Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
That's the best start since SDSU went 15-0 in Earnest Riggins' first season as 
coach in 1983-84. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU's roster included nine freshmen that season. This season, the Aztecs are 
led by a veteran group that includes All- American Chana Perry. 
</P>
<P>
Perry is averaging 26.6 points and 15.8 rebounds and was ranked No. 6 in 
scoring (27.4) and second in rebounding (15.5) in the last rankings released 
Dec. 21 by the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs also were ranked seventh in scoring defense, allowing 54 points per 
game. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU (1-0 in the Big West Conference) plays at UC Irvine Thursday and then 
plays host to San Jose State (Jan. 12) and Fresno State (Jan. 14). 
</P>
<P>
If the Aztecs stay undefeated, they will risk the streak at nationally ranked 
Cal State Long Beach Jan. 19. The 49ers broke the Aztecs' winning streak to 
start the 83-84 season. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about your impact players. Brad Soucie scored a school-record 46 points 
against Point Loma Nazarene when he played his first game for Christian 
Heritage Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Soucie, whose brother, Bill, starts for Christian Heritage, transferred from 
Eastern Michigan last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Brad broke his brother's record of 34 points set last year against UC San 
Diego. Brad was 17 of 26 from the floor, including 6 of 10 from 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Scoring 3-pointers is not new to Brad. He set an NCAA Division I playoff record 
with eight 3-pointers in Eastern Michigan's 108-90 loss to Pittsburgh in the 
first round of the NCAA tournament last year. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore, Soucie averaged 9.6 points and set a team record for 3-pointers 
in a season with 73, making 44.5 %. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Heritage has the best record in the NAIA District 3 with a 10-2 
record. The Hawks currently are on a trip to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
A chronic knee injury has ended Amy Hillebrand's basketball career at U.S. 
International University. Hillebrand, who played at Grossmont College, missed 
13 games last season because of knee problems and played in 9 games this season 
before re-injuring the knee. 
</P>
<P>
Hillebrand was averaging 8.7 points and 5.2 rebounds. Injuries and illnesses 
have hurt the Gulls this season. Forward Fonda DeCree has missed the last 4 
games with a bronchial infection. DeCree was averaging 13.7 points and 7.2 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
USIU is 2-11 and has lost 10 in a row. Its last victory was 74-68 over Arizona 
State on Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Coast Conference men's basketball season starts Wednesday with 
Imperial Valley College favored to repeat as conference champion. 
</P>
<P>
Palomar College might be the best San Diego County school with 6-8 freshman Lee 
Cobb, an All-CIF player from El Camino High School.

<P>
Wall Street opened for business in 1989 with a markdown on Tuesday on a rise in 
concern over interest rates and profit taking. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 23.93 to 2,144.64, a drop of 
slightly more than 1%, although it cut its wider midday loss of more than 35 
points. Broader measures of the market posted smaller declines. 
</P>
<P>
Good news was also indirectly responsible for the stock market's drop. The 
National Assn. of Purchasing Management reported that the economy grew in 
December at its briskest rate in five months. The report raised fears that 
inflation would heat up, and bond prices fell, triggering a sympathetic 
reaction in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
"The real problem today was the drop in the bond market and the drop in the 
dollar. This raised concern about the possibility that the Fed would have to 
tighten (interest rates) further to protect the dollar from further declines," 
said Michael Metz, a market analyst for Oppenheimer &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Computerized program selling added to the pressure on blue chip stocks. Stocks 
that were not involved in the programs fared better, although most also fell. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Murphy, a senior market specialist for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said the 
first day of trading does not necessarily set a trend for the month or the 
year. "This might be a sucker punch day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 3 to 2 in nationwide 
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volumed totaled a modest 128.50 million shares, up from 127.21 
million on Friday. The market was closed Monday for the New Year's holiday. 
</P>

Among individual stocks, Illinois Power led the actives, unchanged at 19 7/8. 
It trades ex-dividend starting today.

American Telephone &amp; Telegraph shares were up 1/8 to 28 5/8. AT&amp;T said 
it has formed a joint venture company with GTE to bring certain technological 
capabilities to GTE's digital telephone switching systems.

Toys R Us Corp. fell 3/8 to 36 3/4 after Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb

Christmas sales. 
</P>
<P>
Several stocks rumored recently as takeover candidates were higher. 
Kimberly-Clark added 2 to 60 1/4; Johnson Controls was up 1 1/8 to 37 3/4, and 
MCA tacked on 1 3/8 to 46 3/4.

Shares of Sara Lee gained 1 3/4 to 43 3/4. Goldman Sachs raised its 
recommendation.

Shares of Sooner Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. dropped 2 1/2 to 4 1/2. It 
said it was looking for ways to boost its capital including bringing in new 
investors.

Holly Farms shares rose 1 1/8 to 56 3/4. The company said it plans to appeal a

CBS RECORDS GOES COUNTRY; 
</P>
<P>
THE SALE OF NASHVILLE PUBLISHER TREE INTERNATIONAL FOR $40 MILLION MEANS THE 
JAPANESE NOW OWN 'HEARTBREAK HOTEL.' 
</P>

<P>
Further consolidating the $1-billion-a-year music publishing industry, CBS 
Records has acquired Nashville-based Tree International Publishing, long 
considered the top country music publisher and the last locally owned 
publishing company in the country music capital. 
</P>
<P>
The deal -- worth about $40 million, according to sources -- gives Sony 
subsidiary CBS Records ownership of more than 35,000 songs, including such 
often-recorded standards as "Heartbreak Hotel," "Green Green Grass of Home," 
"King of the Road," "I Fall to Pieces" and the Willie Nelson classics "Crazy" 
and "Funny How Time Slips Away." 
</P>
<P>
For CBS Records, the acquisition represents only a partial recoupment of what 
it lost when Laurence A. Tisch -- chairman of CBS Inc., the record company's 
former owner -- sold off its music publishing division, CBS Songs, in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"This represents our re-entry into the publishing business in a big way," said 
CBS Records President Tommy Mottola. "Tree will be the cornerstone of our new 
operation, and we'll be very active in pursuing new companies." 
</P>
<P>
Mottola called Tisch's sale of CBS Songs "a critical mistake, second only to 
selling the record company." 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition also represents Sony's commitment to becoming a fully 
integrated entertainment "software" company in the United States. Sony 
reportedly has been seeking to buy a major Hollywood movie studio and recently 
made an unsuccessful bid for MGM/UA. 
</P>
<P>
A music publisher owns or oversees song copyrights, licensing them for use in 
television, movies, advertising and other commercial contexts. The publisher 
collects licensing fees and royalties from the sale of recordings and 
performances, generally splitting the proceeds with the songwriter or copyright 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
"Songs are the lifeblood of what we do," Mottola said. "You can't have a record 
or record company without songs. Even on Wall Street, where they earlier 
frowned on these things, they are now recognizing copyrights and publishing 
companies as very valuable properties." 
</P>
<P>
"Music publishing is attractive because it has very good profit margins, it's 
pretty stable and it's a good offset to the more volatile areas of the 
entertainment industry," said Lisbeth Barron, an analyst for the New York 
investment banking firm of McKinley Allsopp Securities. 
</P>
<P>
According to Barron, the Tree acquisition is "just part of the whole merger and 
acquisition thing that's been going on for the last few years. And they are 
running out of vehicles" to acquire. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, for example, four major companies accounted for the lion's 
share of the then $750-million-a-year music publishing business -- Warner Bros. 
Music, Chappell &amp; Co., CBS Songs and EMI Music. Chappell was purchased from 
Polygram for $100 million in 1984 by an investor group put together by the New 
York securities firm of Wertheim &amp; Co. Chappell was sold to Warner Bros. 
Music last year for a reported $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
CBS Inc. sold CBS Songs to SBK Entertainment for $125 million in 1986, and SBK 
currently is in negotiations to sell itself to EMI for about $340 million, 
according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
Other recent sales include singer Michael Jackson's purchase of ATV Music and 
the Beatles' song catalogue for $47.5 million; Polygram's acquisition of Welk 
Music for a reported $25 million, and Warner-Chappell's purchase of Birch Tree 
Music, the company that owns the copyright to "Happy Birthday to You," for $17 
million. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the growing value of music publishing firms is that the 
so-called "mechanical" royalty -- the money paid to a publisher by a record 
company for each recording of a song sold -- has increased in recent years, 
from 4.5 cents a song to 5.25 cents a song. Another factor is the increased 
sales of recorded music brought on by new technologies such as the compact 
disc. As one veteran music publisher put it, "every time a record is sold or a 
song is performed or broadcast anywhere, some music publisher is getting paid." 
</P>
<P>
All of which is fine for Buddy Killen, the 56-year-old former Grand Ole Opry 
bass player whose 100% ownership of Tree International just made him one of the 
richest men in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel just great," Killen said in a telephone interview. "If I felt any 
better, I'd have to take somethin' for it." 
</P>
<P>
Killen was hired by Tree founder Jack Stapp in 1953 to audition songs and sing 
demos. In 1956 -- "it was Feb. 28th," he recalls -- Killen found a song written 
by Mae Axton and Tommy Durden that he persuaded a young Elvis Presley to 
perform. The song was "Heartbreak Hotel," and "that really got the company 
going," he said. Killen became president and sole owner of Tree after Stapp 
died in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Killen acknowledged that some folks in Music City are not pleased that Tree has 
been sold to a company that's headquartered in New York and owned by a Japanese 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that feeling is natural, and I anticipated it," he said. "But I didn't 
just go off the deep end and sell. This was not a frivolous decision. I thought 
about it for years and negotiated endlessly. Tree belongs to Nashville, and I'm 
going to be sure it remains here. Nashville will be headquarters for CBS 
publishing. We will maintain the Tree name and the staff. I protected Nashville 
and the people here in the contract. I would never do anything detrimental to 
the music industry." 
</P>
<P>
Killen will continue as president of the company and will be in charge of 
finding and acquiring other publishing catalogues. "I just want to have some 
fun with this," he said. "I'm not going to take one day off; I'm just going to 
keep on rocking."

ANTITRUST REVIEW TRIPS UP PEPSICO PURCHASE OF BOTTLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Plans by Pepsico to buy General Cinema's soft drink bottling business for $1.5 
billion have been derailed by an unexpected federal review of antitrust 
implications. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Trade Commission's request for more information about the sale 
prevented its completion by Dec. 31 and cost General Cinema tax benefits valued 
at more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
The news pushed General Cinema stock down $1.50 to a close of $24. Shares of 
Pepsico stock closed at $39.50, unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that (the deal) did not close in 1988 means that we do not have an 
agreement anymore," said Peter Farwell, a vice president with General Cinema, a 
Chestnut Hill, Mass., firm that is one of the largest independent bottlers of 
Pepsico products. 
</P>
<P>
"We're effectively starting all over again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
General Cinema's bottling business had operating profit of $93 million for the 
fiscal year ending Oct. 31. The firm also operates movie theaters with 1,350 
screens, owns 59.9% of the Neiman Marcus Group of retail stores and owns 18% of 
Cadbury Schweppes, a British candy and soft drinks firm. 
</P>
<P>
Pepsico's businesses, with 1988 sales of $13 billion, include soft drinks, 
Frito-Lay snack foods and such restaurant chains as Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and 
Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached Nov. 30, General Cinema was to sell Pepsico its soft 
drink bottling franchises, which are located in California, Florida, Ohio and 
six other states. 
</P>
<P>
Pepsico planned to pay with 20-year, interest-bearing notes in an arrangement 
that may have been worth more than $100 million to General Cinema in tax 
benefits, according to Roy Burry, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
But the tax benefit expired Dec. 31, because of changes made by Congress last 
year for installment sales. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking to determine if there's merit in future discussions," said James 
M. Griffith, a spokesman for Pepsico in Purchase, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
For Pepsico, the transaction would be just the latest in a series of purchases 
that are part of an industrywide strategy in which the big producers are 
expanding their ownership of bottlers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988 alone, the company spent $1.3 billion to buy bottlers, including $705 
million in June for a bottling business owned by Grand Metropolitan, the 
British firm that is taking over Pillsbury Co. Since 1984, Pepsico's ownership 
of its bottling volume has almost doubled to 40% from 22%. 
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola's $1.4-billion purchase of an independent bottler in Tennessee in 
1986 remains the largest such acquisition to date, according to industry 
observers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always felt like it makes a lot of sense to own a portion of the 
bottling business," said Pepsico's Griffith. Such investment enhances a soft 
drink producer's credibility with its independent bottlers, adds to profits and 
bolsters local marketing efforts, Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
General Cinema had not revealed its plans for spending the cash from the deal, 
although analysts had speculated that it might increase its holding in Neiman 
Marcus, which includes Bergdorf Goodman and Contempo Casuals stores, or raise 
its stake in Cadbury Schweppes. 
</P>
<P>
Under U.S. antitrust laws, the FTC may review whether big acquisitions, 
including mergers, will harm consumers by reducing competition and raising 
prices. For example, the FTC blocked plans by Coca-Cola to buy Dr Pepper in 
1986. At about the same time, Pepsico abandoned its plans to take over 
Seven-Up. 
</P>
<P>
Relatively few deals have been blocked during the free-market-oriented Reagan 
Administration, however, and the FTC has previously allowed big acquisitions of 
bottlers by Pepsico and Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
Despite regulatory questions, Joseph Doyle, an analyst with the Smith Barney 
investment firm, told Reuters News Service that the deal is still so favorable 
to both companies that they will likely overcome the difficulties caused by the 
delay. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a 90% chance there will be a new deal, but Pepsi may have to pay $50 
million to $100 million more," he said. "And there may be more cash involved in 
the deal," Doyle said.

JEFFERIES IMPLICATES GAF, EXECUTIVE IN STOCK CASE; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER BROKERAGE CHIEF TELLS OF REQUEST TO BID UP UNION CARBIDE SHARES BEFORE 
SALE OF BIG BLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Boyd L. Jefferies, the former chairman of the Los Angeles-based Jefferies &amp; 
Co. brokerage firm, made his debut as a prosecution witness Tuesday, 
implicating GAF Corp. and its vice chairman in what the government claims was a 
criminal scheme to manipulate stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies, 58, who appeared tan and fit despite a cold, at times had trouble 
remembering dates and couldn't positively identify a central piece of evidence 
in the case, which is being tried in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. But he 
said he clearly recalled a telephone conversation with GAF Vice Chairman James 
T. Sherwin in October, 1986, in which he said Sherwin asked him to have 
Jefferies &amp; Co. arrange to bid up the the price of Union Carbide Corp. 
stock shortly before GAF sold off a big block of Carbide shares. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Sherwin called and asked me, if they wanted to have Union Carbide close at 
a specific price for several days in a row, would I be willing to do that," 
Jefferies testified. "I said, 'Yes,' and Mr. Sherwin said, 'Of course, we'll 
make up any loss to you' " incurred in the transaction, Jefferies said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Implicated in Stock 'Parking' 
</P>
<P>
GAF, a Wayne, N.J., chemicals and building products concern, and Sherwin were 
named in a 10-count criminal indictment returned by a federal grand jury in New 
York in July. They are charged with stock manipulation, securities fraud, wire 
fraud and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors claim that, after an unsuccessful attempt to take over 
Union Carbide earlier in 1986, GAF decided to sell off some of the 
approximately 10 million Carbide shares that it had amassed and enlisted 
Jefferies in a conspiracy to drive up the market price. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies, who built his company into one of the nation's leading traders of 
large blocks of stock, has been cooperating with prosecutors since he was 
implicated by former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky in illegal stock "parking" 
and securities fraud. In stock parking, one individual or firm intentionally 
conceals the ownership of stock that is held for the benefit of another. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies pleaded guilty to two felony counts in 1987 and is still awaiting 
sentencing. He was required to resign as chairman of both Jefferies &amp; Co. 
and its parent holding company, Jefferies Group Inc. He has since been living 
at his home on the grounds of the Vintage Country Club in Indian Wells, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies' performance as a witness is considered crucial not only to this 
trial but to others as well, since he has implicated several individuals in 
allegedly illegal schemes. Among other trials in which he is expected to be the 
star witness is a pending case against Salim B. (Sandy) Lewis, a well-known 
Wall Street takeover specialist and speculator who is accused of manipulating 
the price of Fireman's Fund Corp. stock in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The GAF case is the first of many Boesky-related cases to actually come to 
trial, so it is also being viewed as an important test of how well a jury can 
comprehend the complex workings of the securities world, as well as its jargon. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by Assistant U.S. Atty. Carl H. Loewenson Jr., Jefferies at 
times appeared confused about the precise dates of several of his telephone 
conversations with Sherwin in which he said the GAF official gave him specific 
instructions about the price at which he would like Carbide's stock to close. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies also testified that at Sherwin's request he made up a bill to cover 
the approximately $40,000 in trading losses that Jefferies &amp; Co. suffered 
in buying and later reselling Carbide stock in late October and early November, 
1986. He said he instructed his secretary to falsify the bill to GAF to make it 
appear, as he said Sherwin requested, that the charges were for investment 
banking services for a GAF subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confusion on Dates 
</P>
<P>
But when he was shown copies of two invoices -- one bearing handwriting that 
said "OK" and signed by Sherwin, and another that had the name of the GAF 
subsidiary and was stamped by Jefferies &amp; Co.'s accounting department -- 
Jefferies said he couldn't say which one was actually sent to GAF. 
</P>
<P>
The existence of two invoices was brought out at the trial by Arthur L. Liman, 
GAF's lead defense lawyer. Liman afterward refused to comment. But the defense 
evidently hopes that Jefferies' inability to identify the invoices will cast 
doubt on his claim that he and Sherwin conspired to falsify records of 
Jefferies &amp; Co.'s work for GAF. 
</P>
<P>
Liman is also one of the lead attorneys for Michael Milken, the "junk bond" 
wizard at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. who is expected to be indicted soon. Junk 
bonds are high-yield, high-risk debt securities. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies said he had done business with GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman and Sherwin 
for several years before the alleged market manipulation scheme. He said he had 
held more than 100 telephone conversations with Heyman and many with Sherwin, 
whom he said he had first met in Los Angeles when Sherwin was attending one of 
Drexel's annual junk bond conventions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recounts Personal History 
</P>
<P>
Heyman isn't accused of any wrongdoing in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Before testifying about GAF, Jefferies was asked to lay out for the jury his 
own personal history, which included working as a ranch hand for several years 
after graduating from UCLA. He said he later started at an entry-level job at a 
small Los Angeles brokerage firm and left after six years to found his own 
company, which initially had two employees. 
</P>
<P>
By the early 1980s, Jefferies &amp; Co. had grown to six offices nationwide and 
an office in London. With about 425 employees, it had become a leading firm to 
which big investors went to trade blocks of stock off the floor of the major 
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies testified how on a normal day he would arrive at work between 1:30 
and 2:30 a.m. and remain at his desk at the center of the firm's big trading 
room until 6 p.m. He said he usually tried to get four hours of sleep a night. 
</P>
<P>
His testimony is due to resume today. Prosecutors said they didn't know how 
many days Jefferies would remain on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
The jury, made up mainly of people with blue-collar jobs, has been subjected to 
terms such as "brokers' cost of carry," "pretax equivalent yield" and stocks 
going "ex-dividend." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe repeatedly stopped the proceedings to 
remind lawyers and witnesses that "we are not economists here." As his 
testimony opened, Jefferies was asked to give what amounted to an elementary 
course for laymen on how stockbrokers make their money and on how buying and 
selling shares of stock is actually carried out.

Massachusetts drivers paid the highest auto insurance premiums in the nation in 
1987, an average of $655, according to a report by A. M. Best Co. The national 
average was $487, the Oldwick, N.J., company said in its annual survey of auto 
insurance prices. Iowa had the lowest rates, an average of $256 a year. 
Massachusetts rates jumped an average of $100 in 1987, an 18% increase over 
1986, the report found. After Massachusetts, the most expensive states to 
insure a car were New Jersey ($635), California ($623), Arizona ($602), Nevada 
($600), Maryland ($597) and Alaska ($588), the report found.

Italy, which a year ago triumphantly announced that it had overtaken Britain as 
the world's fifth-largest Western economic power, has slipped back into sixth 
place, according to data released Tuesday by the National Statistics Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Italy's gross domestic product, the broad measure of the goods and services 
that a country produces excluding its foreign income, fell behind Britain's in 
1986, the latest year for which data is available, after having edged ahead in 
1985 for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
The first four places were occupied by the United States, Japan, West Germany 
and France. 
</P>
<P>
Italy's brief success in toppling Britain from fifth place was attributed 
mainly to an 18% jump in its GDP in 1985 as the National Statistics Institute 
attempted to incorporate the booming hidden economy into official figures. 
</P>
<P>
But the recalculation was criticized by some politicians and newspapers because 
boosting official GDP risked forcing an increase in Italy's contributions to 
the European Community budget.

The Treasury sold $7.2 billion of new three-month bills at an average discount 
rate of 8.24%, up from 8.22% last week. Another $7.2 billion of new six-month 
bills was sold at an average discount rate of 8.37%, up from 8.33% last week. 
The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 8.41% on March 25, 
1985, and six-month bills averaged 8.56% on April 8, 1985. The new discount 
rates understate the actual return to investors -- 8.53% for three-month bills, 
with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,791.70, and 8.86% for six-month bills 
selling for $9,576.90. The discount rate reflects the price discount received 
when government securities are purchased at less than face value.

CLEMENTE FUND UNDER SIEGE AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
GRACE-PICKENS TAKES SECOND BID IN 4 MONTHS TO HOLDERS 
</P>

<P>
An investor group, including Thomas B. Pickens III, John S. Grace and Oliver R. 
Grace Jr., Tuesday launched its second attempt in four months to take over 
Clemente Global Growth Fund by taking its pitch directly to the fund's 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Clemente is a closed-end mutual fund that specializes in equity securities in 
small and medium-sized companies in emerging markets around the world. Its 
founder, Lilia C. Clemente, was one of the first money managers to move 
aggressively into global stocks and markets. 
</P>
<P>
Grace-Pickens Global Acquisitions Partners began a tender offer to acquire 4.8 
million shares of Clemente Global -- 81.1% of the outstanding shares -- for $38 
million, or $7.97 a share. The price is based on 92% of the fund's net asset 
value, which was $8.66 a share as of Dec. 29 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Clemente closed Tuesday at $7.375, unchanged from Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refused in September 
</P>
<P>
Grace-Pickens, through various partnerships, already owns 18.9% of the 5.9 
million shares outstanding of Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Clemente's board rejected an offer by the Grace-Pickens group to 
acquire the fund's portfolio of securities for 92 cents on the dollar. 
Clemente's net asset value then was $8.29 a share, which made the offer worth 
about $37.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
"They were trying to buy the assets, not the shares," explained President 
Leopoldo M. Clemente Jr. "Now they are trying to buy shares of the fund. . . . 
The first time the proposal was made to the board of directors. This time it is 
made to the shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
The Clemente board urged shareholders to refrain from making a decision until 
it meets next week to evaluate the offer. About 30% of the stock is held by 
clients of Sanyo Securities, a Japanese firm. The rest is held by American and 
European investors, according to Clemente. Lilia C. Clemente, a widely 
respected money manager, launched the fund June 23, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
What made the fund so vulnerable was the steep 25% discount-to-net asset value 
at which it was selling early in 1988. That has since narrowed to 14.84%. 
Closed-end mutual funds like Clemente's issue a fixed number of shares that 
trade at a premium or discount to their net asset value. Widespread discounts 
have made closed-end funds recent targets of takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
Pickens, youngest son of T. Boone Pickens Jr., and the Grace brothers, distant 
cousins of W. R. Grace &amp; Co. Chairman J. Peter Grace, have made hefty 
profits by buying into closed-end mutual funds and forcing them to convert to 
open-end status. They earned $10 million when the $700-million Japan Fund 
became an open-end fund. The Graces were part of an investment group that 
forced the liquidation of the $200-million Crescent Japan Investment Trust PLC, 
a British closed-end fund.

RADICALLY NEW U.S. APPROACH TO HIGH-TECH RESEARCH URGED 
</P>

<P>
A presidential commission charged with finding a way for the United States to 
beat Japan in capturing a large share of the lucrative market for 
superconductor technology has recommended a radically new approach to promoting 
and funding high-technology research. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's key recommendation is the formation of a half-dozen 
consortiums, each made up of several private companies, a government research 
laboratory and a university laboratory. The federal government would fund the 
long-range research that the companies need but are poorly equipped to pursue 
alone. University facilities, by contrast, are adept at such efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers from each member of a consortium would work together toward making 
marketable products from the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
Without the adoption of such an approach, the commission said in a report to 
President Reagan, U.S. industry "is unlikely to survive in what we believe will 
be a long-distance race" for prominence in the superconductor field. 
</P>
<P>
The new superconductors are ceramic materials that, when cooled to about minus 
238 degrees Fahrenheit, suddenly lose their resistance to carrying electricity. 
This resistance, which creates waste heat, makes electricity more expensive to 
generate, to transmit over wires and to store. 
</P>
<P>
But the cooling process itself requires costly energy. The United States 
currently leads in the search for materials that become superconductors at 
warmer temperatures, making them cheaper to exploit. 
</P>
<P>
Among the new products envisioned with superconductors are super-efficient 
power transmission cables and faster computers. However, the report said some 
of the hopes for superconductivity are overblown. For example, magnetically 
levitated trains still may not be practical in spite of higher-temperature 
materials, said Ralph Gomory, the chairman of the panel and the chief scientist 
of International Business Machines Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed consortiums would close the gap between the short-term profit 
focus of industry laboratories and the long-term scientific focus of university 
laboratories, Gomory said. 
</P>
<P>
Americans are probably "neck-and-neck" with the Japanese in basic scientific 
research on superconductivity, Gomory said. 
</P>
<P>
But the report said that in terms of commercial applications, the Japanese 
effort is "better structured than the U.S. both for systematically developing 
new materials and for coupling these developments closely to industry." 
</P>
<P>
Gomory said important commercial applications are so far off that there is 
plenty of time for Americans to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's just out of the gate. Ahead or behind doesn't matter. What matters 
is who's better structured to run," he said.

PANEL URGES A U.S. 'CATCH-UP' EFFORT ON SUPERCONDUCTIVITY

The United States is likely to fall behind Japan in the commercial exploitation 
of superconductivity unless it puts more money and better organization into 
long-range development, an advisory panel said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The report to President Reagan said the U.S. scientific establishment is not 
organized properly for development work in fields such as superconductivity, 
where important profit-making uses are at least a decade away. 
</P>
<P>
It urged the creation of four to six superconductivity consortiums scattered 
around the country that would unite university, government and industry 
laboratories that are working on superconductivity. 
</P>
<P>
The consortiums would cost the federal government about $25 million to $30 
million a year, on top of the roughly $90 million the government already spends 
on superconductivity research, the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the panel recommended an increase of "a few million dollars" a 
year in grants to universities for basic research. 
</P>
<P>
Superconductors can conduct electricity without any loss of energy from 
resistance when they are kept extremely cold, raising the possibility of more 
efficient engines and motors, faster computer chips and improved scientific 
devices such as particle accelerators and magnetic fusion machines. 
</P>
<P>
Newly discovered materials are superconductive with less refrigeration, which 
makes them cheaper and easier to use. 
</P>
<P>
However, the report said some of the hopes for superconductivity are overblown. 
For example, magnetically levitated trains still may not be practical in spite 
of higher-temperature materials, said Ralph Gomory, the chairman of the panel 
and the chief scientist of International Business Machines Corp. 
</P>

BRITISH-LED GROUP BUYS SAN DIEGO DEVELOPMENT

Symphony Towers, a full-block project that includes San Diego's largest office 
building and a 264-room hotel being built around the San Diego Symphony's 
concert hall, was acquired Tuesday for $164 million by a group headed by a 
British real estate development and investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
A partnership controlled by London &amp; Edinburgh Trust acquired the 
1.1-million-square-foot project from Guy F. Atkinson Co., a San Francisco 
general contracting firm that took it over from Charlton Raynd Development of 
San Diego in September. Charlton Raynd is a limited partner of the new owner. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of Symphony Towers' 34-story office building, the centerpiece of 
the property, is due to be completed in March. The adjoining hotel, also under 
construction, is scheduled to open in January, 1990. It will be managed by 
Marriott Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Through the use of giant cantilevers, the project is being built around and 
over the former Fox Theater, now the property of the San Diego Symphony. 
Douglas P. Wilson, a Charlton Raynd partner, said Tuesday that the symphony's 
arrangement to receive 1 cent per square foot per month of all lease revenue 
generated by the office building during its first five years of operation will 
not be affected by the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson, the parent company of the project's general contractor, Walsh 
Construction, took control of the project in September after Charlton Raynd ran 
into trouble financing the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Charlton Raynd, however, kept an option to buy back the property until Jan. 1. 
The firm joined forces with London &amp; Edinburgh Trust, a publicly owned 
company based in London, and formed Knightsbridge Associates partnership to 
reacquire the project from Atkinson. 
</P>
<P>
The project's financial problems and internal squabbles caused a six-month 
suspension of construction on the 24-story hotel portion of the project before 
work finally resumed last month.

WORRY OVER TRADE DEFICIT HELPS DRIVE DOLLAR LOWER

The dollar began the year Tuesday by skidding lower, largely because of 
pessimism about the U.S. trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Various factors were behind the dollar's decline, but most pointed to concerns 
about trade, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Barbanel, an analyst with Gruntal &amp; Co., said the dollar was affected 
by comments by West German officials that the U.S. currency had reached its 
peak against the mark. 
</P>
<P>
Barbanel said the remarks led traders to believe that "the dollar was getting 
too strong too fast" and therefore set off selling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effect of Trade Surplus 
</P>
<P>
He said financial markets -- including foreign exchange traders -- also wanted 
to send a message to the incoming Bush Administration that the problems of the 
U.S. budget and trade deficits must be dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
Jim McGroarty, a vice president with Discount Corp., said news of an increase 
in the West German trade surplus also fueled the dollar's decline. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has seen a lower dollar as a means of reducing the U.S. 
trade deficit, so increases in the trade surpluses of other countries are taken 
by the markets as portending a drop in the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar also fell now that traders have completed their year-end position 
squaring, Barbanel said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency started its day on a down note overseas and continued to fall 
in New York before regaining some ground. Barbanel attributed the late buying 
to technical market factors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pound Rises 
</P>
<P>
In London, where bank base lending rates are at a high 13%, a government 
assurance that the rate would be kept high to combat inflation drove the 
British pound up more than 2 cents. 
</P>
<P>
One pound cost $1.8270 in London late Tuesday, up from Friday's late $1.8062, 
the last trading day before the New Year's holiday. In New York, the pound rose 
to $1.8225 from late Friday's $1.8115. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late Friday's prices, 
included: 1.7670 West German marks, down from 1.7700; 1.49075 Swiss francs, 
down from 1.4995; 6.0340 French francs, down from 6.0480; 1,300.50 Italian 
lire, down from 1,306.00, and 1.19165 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19245. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared to Friday's late rates, included: 
1.7620 West German marks, down from 1.7725; 1.4912 Swiss francs, down from 
1.5025; 6.0125 French francs, down from 6.0600; 1.9870 Dutch guilders, down 
from 2.0020; 1,295.75 Italian lire, down from 1,305.25, and 1.1900 Canadian 
dollars, down from 1.1927. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo markets were closed for an extended New Year's holiday. The dollar traded 
early in London at 123.80 Japanese yen and was lower late in the day at 123.50 
yen. In New York, the dollar fell to 123.825 yen from late Friday's 124.95. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were marginally higher. 
</P>
<P>
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $411 an ounce, up from 
$410 late Friday. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold rose to $410.80 
from $410 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Silver prices were mixed, slipping in New York after rising in London. Silver 
closed at $6.023 on the Commodity Exchange, down from $6.038 on Friday. In 
earlier London trading, the metal was quoted at a bid $6.07 an ounce, up from 
late Friday's $6.04.

JACK SMITH: ONE DAY IN A CAT'S LIFE AS PLANET TURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Observing that "there is nothing easy about life on a moving planet," Dana 
Dovitch of North Hollywood writes to chronicle a very stressful incident 
involving a friend's kitten. 
</P>
<P>
Dovitch had agreed to take care of the kitten for "an unspecified amount of 
time." Having two cats of her own, she felt quite competent. Her cats, however, 
are cats, not kittens. She says, "I'd forgotten what it's like to have a new 
baby in the house. A baby who eats the plants, misses the cat box, plays at 3 
in the morning, and digs through the trash." (I know what she means.) 
</P>
<P>
She soon began hiding everything of value, and soon she herself didn't know 
where anything was. "I have been in grave danger of losing my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Dovitch has a second-story apartment with an unscreened window that is always 
left open. By some tacit agreement her older cat has given up sleeping on the 
paper for the right to sit on the window sill and watch the birds on a nearby 
power line. "The birds are safe, she is happy and we are able to read (the 
paper) without blowing fur out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
You perhaps have guessed what happened. 
</P>
<P>
One morning after she finished a phone call, Dovitch sensed that the apartment 
was unusually quiet. "No crashing dishes, no falling plants, no nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Feeling a light alarm, she began looking around for the kitten. "I looked and 
looked. I looked in all the practical places first: in rooms, under beds, in 
closets. Then I did the thing I do when I'm looking for my car keys and can't 
find them. I looked in all the same places again and then I began to look in 
stupid places. I looked in the shower, under the stove, behind the 
refrigerator, in the file cabinets. No cat." 
</P>
<P>
Then she had a dreadful thought. The cat had fallen out the window. She looked 
out the window at the pavement below, and thanked God that she saw no furry 
body. 
</P>
<P>
She remembered an article she had read some months before in the View section. 
It said that cats had been known to fall, jump or roll off window sills or 
balconies, but because of their athletic grace and automatic righting reflex 
they landed on their feet and were not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
(The belief that cats can be dropped from any height without injury is a myth. 
According to "The Book of the Cat" (Summit Books) one of my several books on 
cats: "Unfortunately, the almost supernatural powers of balance and agility 
that are attributed to the cat have invested it with an inflated reputation for 
indestructibility. Cats can miscalculate, often fall off things, especially if 
carrying something in the mouth, and occasionally land on their heads. 
Similarly, a cat falling from a very great height may land on all four feet, 
but its legs will probably be broken.) 
</P>
<P>
Dovitch was not entirely reassured by remembering what she had read. "It said 
nothing about the cat suffering from emotional trauma or humiliation, but, as a 
student of psychology and a longtime cat owner, I'm sure that any cat of mine 
would feel like an idiot. Cats are known to be snobs and proud of their ability 
to jump and hit the mark. They even seem to be able to brag about their 
athletic ability in a kind of silent, stuffy cat way." 
</P>
<P>
As a psychologist, Dovitch is entitled to attribute to cats any anthropomorphic 
traits she sees in them; however, I doubt that cats can feel humiliation or 
pride or brag about their skills. On the other hand, I have seen dogs 
embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
On a hunch, Dovitch consulted her older cat. "By any chance did the baby go out 
the window?" The cat said only meow, but from the way she said it, Dovitch was 
sure she was saying yes. 
</P>
<P>
"I found the little visitor down below chasing a lizard through the ivy. As the 
article promised, she was in fine physical shape. However the following day one 
of the goldfish died and I can only presume there was some profound meaning 
there. I'm sure it has something to do with life on a moving planet."

So the cat is OK. But what I want to know is what happened to the lizard?

ALICE KAHN: JUNK PEDDLER TRIES TO MAKE IT IN AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Alice Kahn

<TEXT>
<P>
Tall and pale and young and handsome, the guy from Yugoslavia came walking. He 
was my driver, taking me from my sterile, corporate Los Angeles hotel to LAX. 
</P>
<P>
"So what do you do when you're not driving a car?" I asked him, knowing that 
anyone who is young and handsome in Los Angeles has Big Plans. 
</P>
<P>
"You mean, am I actor?" he said in a thick Slavic accent. "No, I am not actor. 
I am screenwriter." 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of stuff do you write?" I asked, amused. I had heard that an L.A. 
newspaper once put a guy out on Melrose Avenue to ask passers-by, "How's your 
screenplay going?" Nine out of 10 responded, "Almost finished." 
</P>
<P>
"I write crap. . . ," he said, the way Bela Lugosi says, "I am Count Dracula." 
</P>
<P>
I giggled, but he continued in a passionately serious tone. 
</P>
<P>
"I write thrillers. I write the crap that these people want to see," he said, 
gesturing to the mall-sprawl world we motored through. "What these people want 
is junk. That's what they line up for. I write that. 
</P>
<P>
"I do it only for money. That's all I care about is money. When I sell 
screenplay, I get $200,000. If I wanted to be Dostoevksy, I'd write book. I 
want money. That's why I'm here. That's why I write." 
</P>
<P>
He explained that he left Yugoslavia, where he, like his parents, was an 
intellectual and a writer, to come to the United States. He said no country in 
the world has as much democracy and freedom as this country. 
</P>
<P>
"And what will you do with all the money?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Ah, that is question, that is very good question," he said. "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
"So, do you have an agent?" I asked, trying to decide if he was serious. 
</P>
<P>
"No. No agent," he said, "but . . . I know a guy who knows Stallone." 
</P>
<P>
What we had here was a 28-year-old man with a degree in philosophy from the 
University of Belgrade who had been in the United States for 18 months -- and 
already knew a guy who knew a guy. 
</P>
<P>
"This must be very hard for you, writing in a different culture," I offered. 
"Are your stories set in Europe?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, I only write about America. It is not hard. I know what to expect when I 
come here. Nothing surprised me. I drove big American car like this in 
Yugoslavia. I wrote screenplays there. But they pay nothing -- $5,000. Here, 
you write trash and they give you a lot of money. That's why I come." 
</P>
<P>
"But what about the language problem? Don't you find it hard to write in 
English?" 
</P>
<P>
"Not a problem," he said. "I write in Yugoslavian." 
</P>
<P>
(I was trying to imagine the pitch meeting: "Yo, Stallone, I got piece of trash 
written in Yugoslavian. Perfect for you.") 
</P>
<P>
"So you have a story for Stallone. What's it about?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's about a bodyguard who catches his boss in bed with the President's wife. 
Then he blackmails him." 
</P>
<P>
The handsome screenwriter does, in fact, have a translator. This driver is no 
idiot, even if he is trying to write junk that stupid Americans would line up 
to see. He was inspired, he explained, by one of Hegel's greatest hits. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you read Hegel's 'Phenomenology of Spirit'?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No," I said. "But I did see 'Ernest Saves Christmas.' " 
</P>
<P>
We then talked about the master-servant relationship -- as Hegel saw it, as 
Stallone might develop it. 
</P>
<P>
"But with your attitude," I asked, "don't you think you'll have a problem at a 
pitch meeting? Isn't 95% of what goes on in L.A. just sales? You must agree 
that the best salesmen are those who believe in their product." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, could be problem," he admitted, "but I will not tell them it is crap." 
</P>
<P>
This all cheered me up. I was well ahead of the game. See, my screenplay's in 
English, and it ain't half bad.

FRESHENING UP THE IMMIGRANT SAGA 
</P>

<P>
New Americans: An Oral History by Al Santoli (Viking: $19.95, 392 pages) 
</P>
<P>
One of the great elements of the American myth -- and, at the same time, one of 
the great truths -- is that we are a nation of immigrants: every family, with 
the exception of American Indians, came here from somewhere else. Al Santoli 
freshens up the immigrant saga in "New Americans," a series of self-narrated 
profiles of 18 recent immigrants and refugees from around the world who are now 
struggling to make a new life in America. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now experiencing the most awesome surge of immigrants and refugees in 
modern times," explains Santoli, who estimates that about 600,000 legal 
immigrants ("and at least that number of illegal entrants") arrive in America 
every year. "The newcomers, mostly Asians, Latins, Creoles, Africans, Muslems 
and Slavs, are not only changing the ethnic makeup of America, but also 
creating a dramatic impact in many communities." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Masters Manhattan Vernacular 
</P>
<P>
Santoli, a journalist of Italian descent who is married to a Vietnamese 
immigrant, set himself the task of measuring that impact by finding and 
interviewing these "new Americans." The families profiled in his book are drawn 
from the remarkably diverse roster of recent immigrants from Afghanistan, the 
Philippines, Poland, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Ireland, Guatemala, South Korea, the 
Soviet Union, Cambodia, Mexico, Italy, Laos, England, Haiti and Cuba. His 
choices include some fairly successful and well-assimilated people, but he does 
not leave out the immigrants who are still struggling and still suffering. 
</P>
<P>
We meet Maniya (Honey) Barredo, for example, a Filipino immigrant who is today 
the prima ballerina of the Atlanta Ballet. Barredo is one immigrant who quickly 
mastered the distinctly American vernacular of Manhattan, where she studied at 
the American Ballet Center: "I let go of my insecurities and worked my tush off 
to earn a full scholarship at the school," she says. "I've grown here as a 
whole person and have developed as an artist without anyone pushing me -- 
except myself." 
</P>
<P>
We also meet the family of Trong Nguyen, a Vietnamese refugee who has helped to 
turn the blighted Uptown neighborhood of Chicago into a vibrant Little Saigon. 
Says Nguyen, who has mastered another aspect of the American idiom: "Uptown is 
called the Ellis Island of Chicago." (His wife, Thanh, speaks in a more somber 
voice: "When we first came to Chicago, I cried a lot," she explains. "In the 
factory where I worked . . . most were Mexicans, some legal, but also many 
illegal aliens. They acted like, as Vietnamese say, 'Old ghosts bully new 
ghosts.' ") 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone, of course, is quite so well-adjusted. Josef Patyna, a former 
Solidarity activist from Poland who now works in a non-union factory in Rhode 
Island, has discovered that America is not necessarily a kind or gentle place. 
When the Polish-Americans in the neighborhood did not offer to help his newly 
arrived family, he quickly learned the hard lessons of self-reliance in 
America: "At the time, our feelings were hurt," he remarks. "But, looking back, 
my wife and I are very happy, because we helped ourselves. Everything we now 
have came from our own work." 
</P>
<P>
And, like many immigrants, he despairs of the isolation that afflicts American 
life: "We aren't afraid about the next day or what will happen with the 
police," he says. "But we have no close friends here." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, these are men and women who live in the real world, and they are wholly 
unsentimental about the hard life of a new immigrant. A young mother from 
Haiti, for example, is caught in the familiar trap of welfare bureaucracy: 
"Here I don't have anyone to watch my kids so I can look for a job. Even if I 
was working, most of the money I could earn would go to pay a baby sitter, and 
any small income would disqualify me for state help. And now, with the new 
immigration law, it is illegal for someone to hire me." 
</P>
<P>
Still, she prefers Miami's Little Haiti to the grimmer life in Port-au-Prince: 
"Even though my life is uncertain," she says, "I have food. I can say anything 
I want to say. There are no Macoutes or police who bother me." 
</P>
<P>
Many of these immigrants talk at length about the hardship and turmoil in their 
native lands. Mohammad Daud Nassery, a pediatrician who escaped from 
war-ravaged Afghanistan, describes the hothouse politics of his homeland -- and 
the horrors of his escape across a blasted wartime landscape -- in a kind of 
grim poetry. "Houses in ruins, mosques in ruins," Nassery remembers. "Skeletons 
littered fields and the sides of trails. Bones of animals . . . bones of 
humans." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bittersweet Memories 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, these immigrants are eager to unburden themselves of their 
bittersweet memories, but they have learned that their American neighbors are 
not very interested in recollections of the places left behind, or the agonies 
of oppressed people in faraway lands. "I think it makes my husband very happy 
to have the opportunity to talk with you," Krystyna Patyna, wife of Solidarity 
activist Josef Patyna, tells Santoli. "For the first time in a long while, he 
has somebody who is interested in the subject of Solidarity." 
</P>
<P>
Santoli has allowed these "new Americans" to tell their own tales, and they 
offer an unvarnished glimpse of immigrant life in the '80s. (Among the rights 
that every American enjoys, of course, is the right to complain.) In that 
sense, too, the new immigrants are re-enacting the struggles of the generations 
who came before. The gritty truth-telling of "New Americans" only enhances its 
impact as a celebration of the enduring American dream.

SOUND OF MUSIC IS DIFFERENT IN LA JOLLA, NEW DIRECTOR FINDS

Neale Perl, the La Jolla Chamber Music Society's new executive director, 
admitted experiencing a certain cultural deprivation. Last month, Perl moved 
here from Washington, where he was founder and director of the Washington 
Chamber Society, as well as assistant director of the University of Maryland's 
Summer Institute for the Creative and Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
"I've only been here three weeks, and I feel musically starved. We don't have a 
Library of Congress here; it's not as rich a cultural scene as I'm used to in 
New York and Washington. Between Sherwood Auditorium concerts, one just has to 
wait," said the 33-year-old cellist turned administrator. 
</P>
<P>
As director of the San Diego area's leading presenter of classical music -- 
from solo pianists to visiting symphony orchestras -- Perl will have no small 
say in determining which performers will sate the local musical appetite. Perl 
takes over the La Jolla post vacated by Geoffrey Brooks in September. Although 
Perl did not want to describe himself as a Brooks clone, he pointed out several 
similarities between himself and his predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's interesting that Brooks is just a few weeks younger than I. He's a 
violinist -- I'm a cellist. The board wanted someone with a thorough 
understanding of music from a performance point of view. I'm sure they received 
fine resumes from people who were only administrators." 
</P>
<P>
It is easy to understand why the articulate Perl appealed to the chamber music 
society's board of directors. Given the board's distaste for controversy, 
Perl's demeanor, which is every bit as proper and understated as his 
conservative suits, is tailor-made. 
</P>
<P>
A cynical observer might ask why a culture-vulture such as Perl would leave the 
Washington area for San Diego. Perl listed the prestige of the La Jolla 
society, which he characterized as one of the country's leading presenting 
organizations, as a primary motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great opportunity for my career as an administrator," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Perl admitted that much of the La Jolla society's innovative work already has 
been accomplished: its acclaimed summer festival is now three years old, and 
the two complementary downtown series have been successfully launched. 
</P>
<P>
"Granted, things have been nicely set up for me. That's one reason why I came 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Much of his work will be satisfying the audiences of the Sherwood Auditorium 
series, the society's original and most successful series offering. The popular 
Sherwood chamber music series regularly sells out by subscription, although 
chamber music devotees can be counted on to turn up the night of a performance 
for possible cancellations. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even have a ticket for the Sherwood series," said Perl. "People think 
that it's very democratic when the executive director does not have a seat." 
</P>
<P>
From the tenor of Perl's remarks about programming, radical changes under his 
regime appear highly unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's important to be sensitive to the general audience. I've 
experienced in other cities situations where groups would specialize in a 
particular period -- say, Baroque authentic performance practice or 
20th-Century repertory. They play to a limited segment of the musical 
population. I have no desire to do that. I don't know how far into the 20th 
Century we're going, but we'll see." 
</P>
<P>
When asked to list the society's main challenges, Perl put at the top of his 
list expanding the audience base for the newest series, the International 
Orchestra Series at the San Diego Civic Theatre. This fall's inaugural series 
featured the St. Louis Symphony and Moscow State Symphony in local debuts. 
</P>
<P>
"Civic Theatre is a large hall to fill. Right now, the Celebrity Series is 
supporting the orchestra series. This is no surprise to the board, since the 
board is committed to the orchestra series for a three-year test period." 
</P>
<P>
Perl revealed that he had just signed the Philadelphia Orchestra to appear on 
the orchestra series in May, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Philadelphia should help sell subscriptions to the entire series," Perl 
stated. He noted that when the Philadelphia Orchestra would play Washington for 
a three-concert series, only series subscribers were able to hear the 
performances. Single tickets for Philadelphia's finest, he said, remained in 
the hands of the scalpers. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable people in the local cultural community have predicted that Perl's 
biggest challenge would be dealing with the chamber music society's formidable 
board of directors. Its active, strong-willed board is the reverse image of the 
board he worked with at his Washington Chamber Society. 
</P>
<P>
"In Washington, we had a very small board, mostly doctors and lawyers," Perl 
said. "They came to all our concerts, brought their friends, and wrote a check 
every year. They provided some guidance, but basically, they left the running 
of the organization to me and the managing director." 
</P>
<P>
His dealings with the La Jolla board and society president Marie Olesen have so 
far been amicable, he said. Countering a recurring complaint of chamber music 
society employees who have left the organization, Perl asserted that the board 
did not interfere with the day-to-day operation of the society. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that they respect Olesen and that she respects my ability to 
accomplish the tasks and goals I've set."

Actor David Keith will take on the role of the ultimate Marine -- Oliver North 
-- in a TV miniseries scheduled to start next week. Keith, who has played 
military-minded characters in "The Lords of Discipline" and "An Officer and a 
Gentleman," had to convince producers that he could lose his Tennessee accent 
to get the part. The miniseries is based on the biography "Guts and Glory" by 
Boston Globe reporter Ben Bradlee Jr. It follows North from his training at the 
Naval Academy until his retirement last year in the midst the Iran-Contra 
affair. North goes on trial Jan. 31 for his role in the scandal. And how does 
Keith view North? "A brave man, a real cowboy," says the actor. ALEENE MacMINN

Tyne Daly of "Cagney &amp; Lacey" TV fame will star in a $3 million revival of 
"Gypsy" at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa in July as 
part of a pre-Broadway national tour, producer Barry Brown said Tuesday from 
New York. Brown said the "Gypsy" tour will begin in Miami in May with stops in 
Detroit and St. Louis before arriving in Costa Mesa for show's sole West Coast 
engagement (July 18-23). The tour will continue to Denver and Washington 
culminating in a Broadway opening in September, he said. It will mark Daly's 
Broadway debut. ALEENE MacMINN

Country singer Johnny Cash, who underwent a double heart bypass on Dec. 19, was 
released Tuesday from Baptist Hospital in Nashville. Although Cash, 56, had 
suffered lung problems after the surgery, a hospital spokeswoman said the 
complications were not unusual and the doctors would not have released Cash "if 
everything wasn't OK." Cash described the double-bypass as "a great, 
soul-searching experience" and said he'll thank God for bringing him through 
the operation by making a record of Bible readings with another heart patient, 
Waylon Jennings. ALEENE MacMINN

ZIMBALIST, MCCLANAHAN GOOD FIT IN 'BROWN SUIT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Agatha Christie's "The Man in the Brown Suit," airing at 9 tonight on Channels 
2 and 4, is missing its '20s British flavor: This early Christie thriller (sans 
Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot) has been Americanized and updated to the 
present. Christie fans don't have to stay away, though. The breezy adaptation 
leaves the prolific mystery writer's twists and turns fairly intact and makes 
for pleasant viewing. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Alan Grint, set in Middle Eastern and African locales (actually 
filmed in Madrid, Cadiz and off the coast of Spain), the film is escapist fare 
with an international touch. What makes it most worthwhile, however, is the 
enjoyable cast, particularly Stephanie Zimbalist as Christie's adventure-hungry 
heroine, Anne Beddingfeld. 
</P>
<P>
Anne, a tourist in Egypt, witnesses a death and sees a "man in a brown suit" 
running from the scene. She finds murder, stolen diamonds and romance when she 
follows a clue to a cruise ship full of upper-crust eccentrics. 
</P>
<P>
Zimbalist is true to Christie's creation, humorous and feisty, her strong, 
beautiful face fairly aglow with eagerness for adventure and romance. She is 
aided and abetted by Rue McClanahan, who plays bubbly, rich, husband-hunting 
Suzy Blair. McClanahan simply does a variation of her appealing "Golden Girls" 
character, but she and Zimbalist play cozily off each other. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Woodward, Nickolas Grace and Tony Randall are a kick to watch -- Randall 
appears in several guises -- and Simon Dutton is a highly attractive hero. 
Carla Jean Wagner's script fails primarily in the character of a paunchy, 
balding CIA man named Gordon Race (Ken Howard plays this thankless role). 
Christie's original, who appeared in several books, was the darkly handsome, 
mysteriously saturnine Johnny Race of the Secret Service. LYNNE HEFFLEY

In a potentially embarrassing political retreat, Los Angeles Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky reversed himself Tuesday and agreed to a demand by Mayor Tom 
Bradley that would ban retail shops on a proposed bridge at the Westside 
Pavilion shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, following Yaroslavsky's lead, unanimously approved the ban, 
which Bradley demanded last month when he vetoed council approval of an 
expansion of the mall that included the bridge over Westwood Boulevard. The 
council incorporated the retail shop ban on Tuesday into a new ordinance 
approving the project -- one that Bradley said he will support. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, who is expected to challenge Bradley in April's mayoral election, 
said he had enough votes to override the veto but decided to go along with the 
ban to bring an end to his "peacock dance" with Bradley over the controversial 
project. He insisted, however, that the mayor's demand was a "publicity stunt" 
that merely restated a prohibition implicit in the original ordinance, and he 
accused Bradley of playing politics with the shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
"Two weeks ago, when this came before the City Council, the mayor didn't ask 
for such a condition," Yaroslavsky said. "The mayor has tried to exploit an 
issue, almost successfully, at the expense of that neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bradley Praised 
</P>
<P>
But Bradley was hailed as a hero by several nearby homeowner leaders who had 
turned to the mayor for help after Yaroslavsky refused to incorporate the ban 
in the original ordinance. The neighborhoods around the mall have been divided 
over the expansion plan, with some traffic-weary homeowners opposing any new 
development and others welcoming the expansion because it includes extra 
parking and is smaller than originally proposed by the developer. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a victory for Tom Bradley," said Sandy Brown, who has led several 
homeowner groups opposed to the expansion. "He has picked up a lot of homeowner 
support. Homeowners are realizing that Bradley can make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley praised the council for following his lead and said the new ordinance 
is necessary to eliminate any confusion about shops on the bridge, which would 
be built over Westwood Boulevard to allow cars and shoppers to pass between the 
existing mall and the proposed expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't understand why they didn't do this in the first place," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office has said that the expansion would violate 
Proposition U, the growth-limitation measure passed by voters in 1986, if the 
bridge includes retail shops. When the council approved the expansion two weeks 
ago, Yaroslavsky said he believed the ordinance prohibited shops on the bridge, 
but he acknowledged that the language could be interpreted differently. 
</P>
<P>
In vetoing the expansion, Bradley said the council action "leaves the record in 
this matter muddled." He said he would approve the expansion if the council 
added a condition specifically banning commercial uses on the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, eager to steal the initiative from Bradley, helped negotiate an 
agreement Tuesday morning between the developer and five nearby homeowner 
groups that prevents any of them from challenging the new ordinance in court. 
Yaroslavsky said the agreement will save the city thousands of dollars in 
potential legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
But the agreement does not deal with other approvals necessary for the 
developer, Westfield Inc., to build the project. Specifically, homeowners are 
expected to challenge Westfield's request for a separate approval to build a 
structure over a street.

MINKOW AIDE AT ZZZZ BEST GETS 8-YEAR SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Morze, the one-time UCLA linebacker whose finesse with accounting ledgers 
and smooth-talking helped the ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning company pull off a 
$70-million swindle, was sentenced Tuesday to eight years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"The integrity of the American financial system is at stake, and I don't think 
you can just do some wrist-slapping," U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian 
said in sentencing the second of 12 men convicted in the ZZZZ Best case. 
</P>
<P>
Morze, an accountant who prosecutors said had a genius for generating phony 
invoices, ledgers, checks and other financial documents, has been portrayed as 
the brains behind the fraudulent insurance restoration scheme that bolstered 
ZZZZ Best's books with up to $43 million a year in phantom revenues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Senior Vice President 
</P>
<P>
Morze, 38, was appointed by ZZZZ Best founder Barry Minkow as the senior vice 
president in charge of a division that purportedly earned 90% of the company's 
revenues by repairing buildings damaged by fire or flooding. 
</P>
<P>
He was, prosecutor James R. Asperger said Tuesday, a "classic con man" who 
could persuade lawyers and accountants from prestigious financial firms that 
the phony insurance jobs were real -- thus bringing in millions of dollars 
through bank loans and driving up the value of the Reseda-based company's 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
Morze's role, Asperger said, was to breeze in to meet with investment officers, 
introduce himself as ZZZZ Best's vice president in charge of insurance 
restoration, then rush off to catch a plane or answer a phone before too many 
questions could be asked. 
</P>
<P>
In at least two cases, the prosecutor said, Morze led financial officers on 
tours of phony job sites, choreographing every detail to make it appear as 
though the floor space ZZZZ Best had hastily rented in distant office buildings 
was actually the site of extensive restoration jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Minkow had the idea, but he didn't have the bookkeeping skills to carry 
this thing off," Asperger told the court. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors have estimated that Morze funneled more than $3 million to 
himself, his family and his girlfriend, of which about $650,000 was converted 
to cash and cannot be accounted for. Some of the money, Asperger said, went to 
buy cars, furs, a house and jewelry for Morze's girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Amends Cited 
</P>
<P>
Morze told the judge he has sought to make amends for his conduct since the day 
Minkow resigned from the company in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I immediately felt an unbelievable pressure because it started to become 
clear, literally within a matter of hours, just what I had done," he said. "I 
was suddenly barraged with a feeling of remorse, embarrassment and shame." 
</P>
<P>
Even before he hired an attorney, Morze said, he began contacting ZZZZ Best 
board members, notifying them that the insurance restoration work was a hoax 
and offering to make reparations. 
</P>
<P>
He has delivered box loads of financial documents to the government and spent 
nearly 40 hours in interviews with the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service to 
aid ongoing investigations, according to his attorney, Anthony Glassman. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have someone who has committed, without question, a major financial 
offense but who has done everything conceivable to rectify the circumstances," 
Glassman said. "His testimony really was a road map to and through the finances 
of this company." 
</P>
<P>
Morze has said that top ZZZZ Best officials were planning to carry on the fraud 
only long enough to complete a $40-million acquisition of a new chain of 
carpet-cleaning companies. They hoped the deal -- which never was completed -- 
would enable ZZZZ Best to pay off its debts and begin operating legitimately, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Asperger rejected that notion. "I think his hope that the lies would stop 
was really more of a self-rationalization," the federal prosecutor said. "His 
hope that the fraud would be ended was, I think, a pipe dream." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Second-Tier' Defendant 
</P>
<P>
Tevrizian said he was sentencing Morze as a "second-tier" defendant, a man who 
was more culpable than others in the scheme but who was not as guilty as 
Minkow. The judge said he was also taking Morze's cooperation into account. 
</P>
<P>
"Yours was a youth where you were never handed anything. You had to work for 
it," he told Morze. "But people go for the home run all the time . . . (and) it 
only comes one step at a time." 
</P>
<P>
Morze, who pleaded guilty to three counts of stock fraud, bank fraud and income 
tax evasion, will be eligible for parole after serving 32 months of his 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Minkow, who was convicted by a federal court jury Dec. 19 on 57 fraud counts, 
is scheduled for sentencing Feb. 21. He faces a maximum sentence of 403 years 
in prison.

MOVE TO OPEN CARE CENTER FOR YOUTHS BLOCKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY, Times City-County Bureau Chief 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County's chief administrative officer Tuesday blocked a move to 
open a special care center for severely mentally disturbed and abused 
teen-agers who are now kept with less-troubled children at MacLaren Children's 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
The action by Richard B. Dixon drew an angry response from Supervisor Pete 
Schabarum, who has been pushing for the intensive care facility since 1985. 
Accusing Dixon of bureaucratic delays, he said, "You've done a good job in 
giving me a lot of bull in this matter." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pressure from Schabarum, other board members decided to delay 
action on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Struggle for Services 
</P>
<P>
The controversy over care of abused children -- made dependents of the county 
by the courts -- is one aspect of the overall struggle of county government to 
provide social, psychiatric and medical services in a time of ever-decreasing 
funds for local government. 
</P>
<P>
That struggle may become even more intense next week when Gov. George 
Deukmejian will present a state budget that is expected to provide county 
governments much less than they say they need for such services. 
</P>
<P>
At issue Tuesday was the care of about 50 severely disturbed youngsters -- 
between 13 and 17 years old -- at MacLaren Children's Center, which is the 
county facility for neglected and abused children, including those abused 
sexually, who have been taken from their homes by courts and placed under 
county care. The center now cares for about 260 children. Of the 50, 13 need 
individual, "one-on-one" care, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum and the county Department of Children's Services have been pushing 
for opening a separate facility. Department official Al May said the badly 
disturbed children are now mixed with less-troubled ones at MacLaren, where, he 
said, it is difficult to prevent the youngsters from escaping. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids need medication and a variety of things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Care Center Proposed 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Telecare Corp. of Oakland proposed opening a care center for 
the youngsters at the site of a nursing home in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Telecare has won major contracts to perform work for the county Department of 
Mental Health, including operation of a care facility on the grounds of 
Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
The firm has contributed to the political campaigns of the Board of 
Supervisors' conservative majority, which strongly favors having private 
companies do work once exclusively performed by government. The company has 
given Supervisor Deane Dana $7,500, Schabarum $350 and Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich $500 in recent years, according to campaign contribution reports. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum backed the Telecare proposal, although an aide said the supervisor 
was more interested in beginning a program for the disturbed youngsters than 
seeing that a particular firm got the job. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fiscal Problems Cited 
</P>
<P>
Dixon, in recommending that the proposal be turned down, cited fiscal problems 
as a major reason. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the county is awaiting an appellate court decision on a suit by 
mental health advocate groups stopping a $17-million economy cutback in county 
mental health treatment centers. 
</P>
<P>
"We would run the risk of further expanding our budget problems if we hastily 
committed the county to this project," he said in a report. "If the court rules 
against us, we would not have the required financing available. I therefore 
cannot recommend taking any binding actions until we have received a favorable 
ruling." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon and Board Chairman Ed Edelman, who represents East Los Angeles, both also 
cited the possibility of neighborhood opposition to the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman said it "was not the best location." Dixon said county officials face 
the task of persuading neighbors to accept a mental care facility in the area.

 COMPUTER 'HACKER' AGAIN DENIED BAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A "hacker" charged with infiltrating computer systems in the United States and 
England, was declared "a very, very great danger to the community" Tuesday by a 
judge who renewed his imprisonment without bail. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer made her ruling after Kevin David 
Mitnick, 25, of Panorama City pleaded not guilty to computer fraud charges and 
his attorney urged the judge to release him on bail. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Alan Rubin, who argued that Mitnick is "being held 
incommunicado" and being treated more harshly than men charged with violent 
crimes, accused the government of exaggerating the seriousness of the case. 
</P>
<P>
Mitnick is accused of unauthorized use of MCI long-distance codes to tap into 
computers at Leeds University in England and USC and of causing $4 million 
damage to a Digital Equipment Corp. computer system. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Leon Weidman said additional charges will likely be filed 
against Mitnick next week. "We believe he's extremely dangerous and should not 
be allowed any access to a computer or telephone," Weidman said.

 LAKERS FAN WON'T GET $540,000 AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state appeals court has overturned a $540,000 jury award to a fan who fell 
from a fence while drunk after a Los Angeles Lakers basketball championship 
game at the Inglewood Forum in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The 2nd District Court of Appeal rejected the lower court verdict, which found 
California Sports Inc., owner of the Forum, 27% liable for the accident that 
left plaintiff Thomas Edwards with severe head injuries. Jurors laid the rest 
of the blame on Edwards and set damages at $2 million, meaning California 
Sports would have had to pay $540,000. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards had argued that the company was negligent because the 4-foot-tall fence 
had horizontal bars, likened to a ladder, that made it easy to climb. 
</P>
<P>
The court rejected that argument and noted that testimony showed Edwards was 
drunk when he climbed the fence and fell. 
</P>
<P>
"One can conjure up all manner of extreme measures which might have prevented 
this particular injury, but that is not the issue," Justice Lynn Compton wrote 
for the court. "There is a limit as to how far society should go by way of 
direct governmental regulation of commercial and private activity . . . in 
order to protect individuals from their own stupidity, carelessness, daring or 
self-destructive impulses."

 MCMARTIN TRIAL WILL NOT BE OVER SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The long-running McMartin Preschool molestation trial is going to run even 
longer than predicted -- probably until autumn, the trial judge said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish all of you a happy new year and an end in 1989 to our sufferings in 
court," Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders told lawyers as they 
returned from a holiday recess. 
</P>
<P>
Pounders then asked for a "realistic estimate" from defense lawyers on when 
their case might conclude. Danny Davis, who represents defendant Raymond 
Buckey, said the defense case will probably go "well into May." 
</P>
<P>
The judge, noting that prosecutors have estimated two months for rebuttal and 
the defense an additional month, said that with a month of final arguments, the 
case probably won't reach jurors before September. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors, who have been serving on the case for a year and a half, had been told 
that the trial would conclude in April. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, 30, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 61, are charged with 65 
molestation and conspiracy charges stemming from their operation of the defunct 
McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach.

PIG CARCASS LEFT OUTSIDE HOME OF JEWISH ACTIVIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police were trying to learn Tuesday who left a skinned pig carcass outside the 
home of Stanley Sheinbaum, the publisher and activist who, with four other 
American Jews, recently met in Sweden with Palestine Liberation Organization 
Chairman Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
Sheinbaum and his wife, Betty, told West Los Angeles police detectives that the 
dead animal was left in their driveway between 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. on New 
Year's Day while they were away. 
</P>
<P>
With the pig was a blood-saturated note that read, simply, "Troy." 
</P>
<P>
Sheinbaum, 68, an economist, Democratic Party fund-raiser and University of 
California regent, said he did not know the significance of the message. 
</P>
<P>
"It has no meaning for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the Jewish community have charged that Arafat is trying to use 
his recent recognition of Israel's right to exist and the resultant 
conversations with the United States as a "Trojan horse" to infiltrate Israeli 
defenses. 
</P>
<P>
"One doesn't like this sort of thing," Sheinbaum said. "It has an ugly quality 
to it." 
</P>
<P>
He said the act was the work of "some people whose quality is reflected by 
their own actions." 
</P>
<P>
Sheinbaum conceded that "a lot of my fellow Jews are very upset that I met with 
Yasser Arafat."

MAYOR'S VENDETTA OUSTED HIM, SAYS IRWINDALE OFFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former redevelopment consultant to the city of Irwindale has said a move to 
fire him was part of a vendetta by Irwindale Mayor Pat Miranda, who was 
frustrated in an attempt to use the city's redevelopment agency for personal 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Lyte told Miranda in a statement that the mayor had "disrupted and 
harassed our staff because we would not take unethical or illegal actions for 
your personal benefit." The statement was given to the mayor and City Council 
before it voted to fire him Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Lyte accused Miranda of trying to destroy the city's redevelopment agency and 
called his actions "a disgrace." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Determined to Stay 
</P>
<P>
"You have said that . . . even if you can't get the votes to fire me, you will 
continue to harass me until I quit," the statement said. "Don't hold your 
breath. I do not intend to leave Irwindale voluntarily because I am needed here 
to protect the people . . . against your deceit and greed." 
</P>
<P>
Miranda responded to Lyte's charges with a brief statement of his own, 
addressed to the city residents. The mayor said he had become convinced that 
Lyte, a key figure in negotiations to bring the Los Angeles Raiders to 
Irwindale, had been paid too much in commissions in his post as redevelopment 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked Charles Martin, our city manager, how much the city had paid Fred Lyte 
in about 10 years and he said about $6 million," Miranda said. "That may be 
about $4.5 million more than other cities may have paid (their consultants)." 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, he indicated, he wanted to rewrite Lyte's contract before the 
council decided to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Miranda said Tuesday that any further response would only give 
credibility to Lyte's remarks, which Miranda considers "nothing but sour 
grapes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Point of Accusation 
</P>
<P>
Miranda did not answer a pointed accusation in Lyte's statement that "probably 
no one" had benefitted more from the activities of the redevelopment agency 
than the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to property where Miranda operated a taco stand, Lyte declared that 
the site, "which was worth about $25,000 12 years ago, has been leased to 
Hopkins Development under an arrangement where you will receive a minimum of 
$1,680,000 over the period of your lease. I understand that the execution of 
this lease by you was a probable conflict of interest violation." 
</P>
<P>
Lyte accused Miranda of wanting to fire him in part because the agency made 
another deal with Hopkins Development which would have paid other parties more 
than Miranda would get from his deal with the company. 
</P>
<P>
"You came to Charlie (Martin) and me and said that your manhood would be 
questioned if the (other party) got more than you did," he charged. "You asked 
us to coerce Hopkins . . . into paying you . . . another $800 per month through 
denials of permits and other governmental actions. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told that we would regret it if we didn't. However, we refused to 
blackmail Hopkins for your benefit and this was when your attacks on me first 
started." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Motive Suggested 
</P>
<P>
Another motive, Lyte charged, was that Miranda may be "trying to kill the 
Raider deal and a good way to do it would be to get rid of Charlie (Martin) and 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Miranda has questioned rising legal and environmental costs associated with the 
Raider project, but he has not said he wants to kill it. An environmental 
impact report is scheduled for council discussion this week. 
</P>
<P>
Lyte's statement is the latest in a series of allegations that Irwindale 
officials have profited immensely from dealings as officials. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 24, 1987, a Times story detailed instances in which Irwindale 
officials had steered millions of dollars in city contracts to private 
businesses that they either owned or had a substantial interest in. The story 
also said that Lyte, in negotiating the Raider deal, appeared to have violated 
a provision in his contract forbidding him from recommending to the City 
Council a project in which he had a financial interest. 
</P>
<P>
Under his contract with Irwindale, Lyte, who virtually directed the 
redevelopment agency although he had only the title of consultant, was to 
receive a fee of $2 million once the Raider stadium in Irwindale was completed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Total of All Fees 
</P>
<P>
In his statement, he acknowledged that for industrial and other projects he had 
arranged over a 12-year period for Irwindale, he stands to receive a total fee 
of about $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
"To date, my projects will result in Irwindale receiving about $600 million . . 
. and I will receive about 1% of that amount," he said. "That's not bad for a 
city that had $25,000 in the bank 12 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Lyte said that for 12 years the mayor had insisted on such a fee arrangement 
and "rejected a straight salary arrangement" suggested by Lyte. He noted that 
part of his contract called for him to pay all his own expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Miranda said in his statement that he understands "our city was about the only 
city of the cities near us that paid anyone in the community redevelopment 
agency on a commission basis to bring business into the city."

ORANGE COUNTY CONGRESSMEN ARE SWORN IN

<P>
Orange County's two new Republican congressmen, C. Christopher Cox of Newport 
Beach and Dana Rohrabacher of Lomita, were sworn in Tuesday in a Capitol 
ceremony nearly 2 centuries old. 
</P>
<P>
Cox, 36, a former White House lawyer, said he was feeling grateful as he rose 
from his seat in the House of Representatives and raised his hand to take the 
brief oath of office along with his new colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long-Shot Bid 
</P>
<P>
"You think of all the people who are responsible for putting you where you 
are," Cox said of the supporters for his long-shot bid to represent the 40th 
District, one of the nation's most securely Republican. "You don't feel like 
someone who set a new record in a track event because you didn't do it by 
yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, 41, said the thought going through his mind was: "This is it, and 
I'm ready!" He said he had viewed Congress from California as a journalist and 
from the White House as a speech writer for President Reagan and now found it 
"not just exciting but fascinating to get the view from inside, from the other 
end of Pennsylvania Avenue." 
</P>
<P>
The two men took the oath amid a telegenic sea of red ties, white shirts and 
dark suits punctuated by an occasional bright red or royal blue dress worn by 
one of the few women members of the House. Also on the floor were many children 
who, wearing floor passes tied around their necks with bright red ribbons, were 
allowed to join their parents for this one special occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Cox and Rohrabacher, both bachelors, each defeated a wide field of GOP 
candidates to win their party's nominations in their districts, which are so 
predominantly Republican that the winner of the June primary easily wins the 
general election. Both positioned themselves to the right of their competitors 
and, as a trump card, brought in retired Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, a 
hero to conservatives despite his indictment in the Iran-Contra scandal, to 
campaign for them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cox Replaces Badham 
</P>
<P>
Cox replaces Rep. Robert E. Badham (R-Newport Beach) of the 40th District, 
which stretches inland from Newport Beach, and Rohrabacher succeeds Daniel E. 
Lungren (R-Long Beach) of the 42nd District, which straddles Orange and Los 
Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
Badham, who served on the House Armed Services Committee, retired after 12 
years to be a private consultant to defense firms. Lungren, who was first 
elected to the House in 1978, left office after Gov. George Deukmejian chose 
him as state treasurer to replace Jesse M. Unruh, who died in 1987. Lungren 
failed to be confirmed by the state Legislature and now is returning to private 
practice as a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
At noon here, in brisk sunshine, Cox and Rohrabacher began their first day in 
Congress by walking from their new offices in the Cannon and Longworth House 
office buildings across the street to the Capitol. The 2-hour session began 
with an invocation and moved to the first vote of the 101st Congress: the 
election of Speaker of the House. 
</P>
<P>
At 12:42 p.m., Cox cast the first vote of his congressional career for House 
Minority Leader Bob Michel of Illinois. Eighteen minutes later, in the 
alphabetical roll call vote, Rohrabacher followed suit. But the outcome of the 
vote was predetermined in the Democrat-controlled House, which reelected Jim 
Wright of Texas 253 to 170. 
</P>
<P>
As the hourlong speakership vote took place, Cox and Rohrabacher joined in the 
general hubbub, meeting members of Congress on the Republican side of the aisle 
whom they did not know and greeting those they had previously met. At several 
points, the commotion from this shared activity became so rambunctious that the 
gavel was struck in vain efforts to restore order. 
</P>
<P>
When the vote was completed, Wright delivered a message in which he made a 
strong plea for bipartisanship, especially in foreign matters. He then asked 
the members of the 101st Congress to raise their hands to swear their 
dedication to their country and their duties for the next 2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Also sworn in were Orange County's three other congressmen, Robert K. Dornan of 
Garden Grove, Ron C. Packard of Carlsbad and William E. Dannemeyer of 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
As he took the oath, and during the previous 2 hours, Dornan carried around the 
sometimes-sleeping Haley Olivia Dornan, his granddaughter. Dornan later 
reported that the child, who will be a year old in a few days, took her first 
step on the Speaker's table. 
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, Rep. Cox returned to his newly occupied office, still 
strewn with unopened boxes and stacked with furniture, for a reception for 
about 40 friends that included many of his co-workers from his 2 years as 
senior associate counsel in the White House. They congratulated him while 
munching on turkey and ham sandwiches and drinking coffee and soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Joined by Parents 
</P>
<P>
Joining in the celebration was Rohrabacher and his parents, Doris (Fluff) and 
Don Rohrabacher of Temecula, and girlfriend Paula Dobriansky, a deputy 
assistant secretary of state for human rights whom he met while writing 
speeches in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Cox said his family, including his parents and four sisters and their families, 
most of whom live in Minnesota, will attend the Jan. 20 inauguration, thus they 
did not make the trip to the Capitol for the swearing-in ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Still ahead for the two new congressmen are vying for committee assignments and 
organizing their staffs in both Washington and their home districts. But 
Tuesday was mostly a day to enjoy the fruits of victory. 
</P>
<P>
Cox, pointing to the round red lapel pin of the 101st Congress, said what 
struck him the most about his first day was "the entire experience of being 
clearly identified as a member of Congress by this badge and being treated as 
such by all of my colleagues." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "It was nice to be on the job." 
</P>

with the AIDS epidemic: A just-say-no campaign to sex. (Part II, Page 4.)

CAR HITS WOMAN, 2 GRANDCHILDREN AT SCHOOL CROSSWALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An elderly woman and her two granddaughters were struck by a car and seriously 
injured Tuesday afternoon while walking hand-in-hand in a marked crosswalk near 
an elementary school in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
Six-year-old Mary Dargan was listed in critical condition at UCI Medical Center 
in Orange with a broken neck and severe head injuries. Her 72-year-old 
grandmother, Rose Dargan, was also in critical condition at Los Alamitos 
Medical Center in Los Alamitos. Hospital officials would not specify her 
injuries. Morgan Dargan, 5, was reported in good condition with a broken leg at 
La Palma Intercommunity Hospital in La Palma. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car, identified as Deborah A. Casey, 25, of La Palma was not 
injured. But witnesses said she was in hysterics after the collision and had to 
be sedated. Police questioned her at the scene, then released her without a 
citation, pending investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Casey's family said she told them she never saw the pedestrians. 
California Department of Motor Vehicles files showed that Casey has a clean 
driving record. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors complained Tuesday that the intersection has been the scene of 
several accidents because there is no traffic light. Studies in other cities 
have shown that pedestrians are more likely to be hit at a marked crosswalk 
than at an unmarked crossing because they feel a false sense of security. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the accident occurred at 2:18 p.m. in a yellow crosswalk on 
Crescent Avenue at San Marino Drive, across the street from San Marino 
Elementary School, where, family members said, the Dargan sisters attend 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Back to School 
</P>
<P>
Rose Dargan and Morgan, a kindergartner who was already out of class, had gone 
to the school to escort Mary, a first-grader, back across Crescent Avenue to 
their home, about a block away on San Marino Drive, said the girls' aunt, 
Colleen Martinelli. Rose Dargan lives with the girls and their parents, Bill 
and Bernadeen Dargan, a high school coach and retail store worker, 
respectively. Both parents were at work at the time, other family members said. 
</P>
<P>
Rose Dargan and her granddaughters were walking hand-in-hand through the 
crosswalk, as relatives said they do every school day, when they were hit by a 
late-model compact car traveling west on Crescent Avenue. Witnesses said other 
cars had stopped for them and that the pedestrians had almost made it across 
the street when they were hit. The impact threw Mary in the air and knocked her 
sister and grandmother to the ground, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, it was awful, just awful," said Connie Castillo, 32, a nearby resident who 
called the police after seeing what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in my house sewing when I heard the screeching of tires. I thought it 
was two cars colliding because it was so loud -- metal on metal." 
</P>
<P>
The driver, later identified as Casey, stood in the street screaming 
hysterically, Castillo said. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park paramedics took the elderly woman and the girls to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park police issued a brief press release, stating only that the accident 
is being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Terry McMillen declined to speculate on whether a marked 
crosswalk at the intersection contributed to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
McMillen said only that Crescent Avenue was one of the busier streets in Buena 
Park and that he had no studies comparing its accident rate to other streets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficulty Seeing 
</P>
<P>
A study in San Diego about 10 years ago determined that pedestrian accident 
rates dropped 25% when all crosswalks were removed. The study cited 
pedestrians' false sense of security, as well as the difficulty by motorists in 
seeing the crosswalk, as the main factors behind the higher accident rate at 
marked crossings. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Anaheim has been gradually removing its marked crosswalks, 
while Villa Park agreed to install traffic signals at one crosswalk at which 
two junior high school students were struck and killed 3 years ago. Other 
communities in the county, including Newport Beach, have been analyzing their 
marked crossings in the wake of pedestrian mishaps. 
</P>
<P>
In Buena Park on Tuesday, residents near San Marino Elementary School said the 
marked crosswalk on Crescent Avenue does not prevent traffic from speeding down 
Crescent Avenue even as children are preparing to cross. The speed limit is 25 
m.p.h. during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't stop," said Kris Cisneros, 19. "They see you and they don't 
stop." 
</P>
<P>
Castillo said a traffic signal is needed at the intersection. She noted that 
there are signals at the intersection of Crescent Avenue and Valley View Street 
-- a quarter of a mile west -- and on Crescent Avenue and Holder Street -- a 
quarter of a mile east. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Crossing Guard 
</P>
<P>
Castillo said San Marino Elementary officials have a crossing guard at Crescent 
and Valley View but do not post one at the crosswalk where Tuesday's accident 
occurred. She noted that only a few children who live on the north side of 
Crescent across from San Marino Elementary attend the school. Most, she said, 
attend another area school. 
</P>
<P>
San Marino Elementary officials could not be reached for comment late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Casey's mother, Jeanette Casey, also complained that a light was needed at the 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not marked well," Jeanette Casey said. "It should have signs." 
</P>
<P>
There is a yellow school crossing sign posted alongside the crosswalk. 
</P>
<P>
Casey could not comment because she was under sedation late Tuesday, muttering 
over and over the word "child," her mother said. Jeanette Casey said her 
daughter, who lives at home and attends college, had gone up to an automotive 
shop Tuesday to have a new battery installed in her 1985 Plymouth Tourisimo. 
</P>
<P>
Casey was returning home with the new battery when the accident happened, 
Jeanette Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Horrible Thing' 
</P>
<P>
"She told me it had just stopped raining and that she turned off her windshield 
wipers, when they (the pedestrians) just stepped out," Casey said. "It was one 
of those horrible things." 
</P>
<P>
Family members gathered to comfort one another at each of the hospitals where 
the victims were being treated. The girls' parents maintained a vigil outside 
the emergency room of UCI Medical Center, while aunts, uncles and cousins did 
the same elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Alamitos Intercommunity Hospital, Morgan Dargan was able to chat 
happily with relatives. Family members said they had not told her how seriously 
injured her sister and grandmother were. 
</P>
<P>
"She told us that when she was lying in the street, they had to cut off the 
clothing she was wearing," Martinelli said. 
</P>
<P>
Martinelli added that the girls had just participated in a huge family reunion 
over Christmas at which they were showered with gifts and cards from a mostly 
childless clan of 15 aunts and uncles. Martinelli said she had dressed as Santa 
Claus to entertain the Dargan girls and their four cousins. 
</P>
<P>
Mary and Morgan are also very popular in their neighborhood of single-story, 
stucco homes. 
</P>
<P>
"They're sweet little things," said 14-year-old Chrissy Berry, a next-door 
neighbor. "Rose (the grandmother) is nice, too." 
</P>
<P>

HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCIL VOTES TO OPEN TALKS WITH OIL FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to open talks with a major oil 
company to decide whether the company should consolidate its oil drilling 
operations at a 2-block site in the city's old downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-month negotiation period approved by the council with South Coast Oil 
Corp. will allow the company and the city to determine the impact of 
consolidating the oil drilling facilities in the area bordered by Walnut and 
Orange avenues and Lake and Second streets, according to Deputy City 
Administrator Douglas La Belle. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the negotiation is to . . . determine economic feasibility and 
compatibility with surrounding land uses," said La Belle, adding that South 
Coast Oil owns 90% of the scattered oil wells in the residential area where the 
consolidated sites would be located. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in another Huntington Beach community have filed a lawsuit 
challenging a similar plan in their neighborhood. Concerned Citizens of 
Huntington Beach have alleged that the council violated the city's General Plan 
when it approved Angus Petroleum Corp.'s proposal to consolidate several dozen 
scattered wells onto one site near the intersection of Springfield Avenue and 
California Street. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Grace Winchell said Tuesday that the consolidated drilling sites 
can be beneficial because they use more powerful drilling equipment to get a 
greater oil yield than smaller wells. In addition, she said, the consolidation 
would enhance city redevelopment efforts by increasing available land when 
scattered wells are capped.

FIRE DESTROYS RESTAURANT IN FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
Fire gutted a popular restaurant in downtown Fullerton early Tuesday, prompting 
officials to close the landmark building housing the business, a city 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Tony's Melody Inn at 106 S. Harbor Blvd. was destroyed and half of its 
next-door neighbor, Furniture Concepts, burned, spokeswoman Sylvia Palmer said. 
The two other businesses in the building escaped damage. 
</P>
<P>
"The actual damage has not been determined but is expected to exceed $1 
million," Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the two-story building, which was built in the early 1900s, will be 
demolished because "the fire removed the structural support for the masonry 
walls." 
</P>
<P>
The fire started in the common attic of the two businesses and was discovered 
by a Fullerton Fire Department engine company that was returning from a medical 
aid call about 11:58 p.m. Monday, Palmer said. It took 36 firefighters from the 
Fullerton, Buena Park and Anaheim departments until 2:30 a.m. to control the 
blaze, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's chief building official deemed the building unsafe for entry, which 
meant fire officials could not enter the building to determine the cause of the 
blaze, Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Marshal Mark Martin said debris will have to be removed before 
firefighters can safely enter the building. At the earliest, removal will occur 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The northbound curb lane in the 100 block of South Harbor Boulevard was closed 
as a result of the damage, Palmer said. The lane may be reopened this 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The Melody Inn, which started in the 1940s as a nightclub, was refurbished a 
few years ago when Tony Florentine acquired ownership and reopened it as a 
restaurant and cocktail lounge. Neither he nor Pierre Nicolas, owner of the 
landmark building, could be reached for comment.

GUARD SESSIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE; 
</P>
<P>
HOMELESS CAN'T USE ARMORIES ON WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Long-planned National Guard training sessions will monopolize armories in Santa 
Ana and Fullerton for most of this week, making them unavailable to the 
homeless who have been sheltered there during recent cold nights. 
</P>
<P>
The news caught county officials and local help-the-homeless volunteers by 
surprise. Volunteers confirmed the news Tuesday, then issued an urgent appeal 
for temporary shelter space should cold rains or frigid night-time temperatures 
make emergency shelters necessary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exhibit Halls Suggested 
</P>
<P>
"We need big gymnasiums, maybe exhibit halls like the ones at the fairgrounds, 
maybe big church halls," said Scott Mather, who heads the Orange County 
Homeless Task Force. His mainly volunteer organization coordinates the opening 
of emergency shelters when overnight temperatures are predicted to fall to 40 
degrees, or to 50 degrees when a 50% chance of rain is forecast. 
</P>
<P>
"The county has the cots, blankets and towels, and we have the food, 
transportation and volunteers," Mather said. "We have everything to operate a 
facility; all we need is a facility. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made a few contacts, but we're not getting very far," Mather said late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The forecast for the rest of the week is that a cold front will move into 
Orange County and the rest of the Southland on Thursday, which could mean a 
return of rain and cold weather. The National Weather Service, whose forecasts 
govern whether emergency shelters are opened, was predicting low temperatures 
in the 40s for Thursday through Saturday mornings. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Steve Mensik, a National Guard spokesman in Sacramento, said the coming 
weekend is "a heavy drill weekend throughout the state. We try to have everyone 
drill on the same weekend. I'd be surprised if there are any armories not being 
used this weekend for (the) drill." 
</P>
<P>
Typical training will be refresher courses in map reading, radio operation, 
first-aid and mobilization procedures, Mensik said, adding that such training 
weekends are scheduled more than a year in advance. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the training, the Santa Ana and Fullerton armories would not be 
available to the homeless on Friday or Saturday nights, Mensik said. In 
addition, the Fullerton armory will be closed Thursday and Sunday nights 
because it will be involved in equipment loading and unloading operations. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Santa Ana armory could be made available to the homeless on 
Thursday and Sunday nights, Mather said, "We're still going to be jammed." 
</P>
<P>
Mather said the surprise word of the armory-scheduling problem resulted from "a 
breakdown in communication." 
</P>
<P>
"We reserved the (Santa Ana and Fullerton) armories for December and January, 
but we didn't know that the Guard's regularly scheduled activities would take 
precedence over ours," he said. "Nothing can be done about it. There's no bad 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the armories have been open for the homeless all but two days since 
Dec. 15, Mather said. They were not open on Dec. 21 because the weather was 
unusually warm, and they were not open on Dec. 26 because county officials 
miscalculated that the day would be warm, when in fact it turned very cold, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The armories did not open Tuesday night because the prediction of rain was only 
20% and temperatures were forecast to dip to the middle-to-high 40s. 
</P>
<P>
Mather said donors of temporary shelter space will, under state law, be free of 
liability hazard and will have exclusive use of their facilities during 
daylight hours. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been doing this for a while and it goes very smoothly. If someone opened 
up a hall for us, we'd have them in about 5 p.m. and out by 7:30 a.m." He said 
those spending the night in such shelters would be transported by volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Mather said what is needed is a large floor space with a nearby kitchen and, 
ideally, shower facilities. "Showering is important. A lot of these guys have 
jobs," he pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
Shelter is needed for a total of about 300 people, Mather said. He estimated 
that the average high school gymnasium would comfortably house about 120 people 
and the average church hall about 75 to 100.

JUDGE'S REVERSAL OF MASSIP CONVICTION WILL BE APPEALED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<P>
Charging that a judge had abused his authority, Orange County prosecutors 
decided Tuesday to appeal his decision to throw out a murder verdict against a 
woman who claimed that she was suffering from a severe form of the "baby blues" 
when she killed her 6-week-old son. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 23, Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald stunned a Santa Ana 
courtroom by overriding a second-degree murder verdict against Sheryl Lynn 
Massip of Anaheim. In acquitting Massip on grounds of insanity, Fitzgerald 
found that the 24-year-old former hairdresser was suffering from postpartum 
psychosis when she killed her colicky infant by running over him with the 
family car. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Precedent Setter? 
</P>
<P>
Legal observers said that the judge's decision to disregard the jury's verdict 
and find Massip insane in such a case appeared to be without precedent. 
Prosecutors charged Tuesday that the ruling was illegal and could send a 
troubling signal of expanded judicial power. 
</P>
<P>
"If we allow judges to replace a jury's verdict with their own opinions, the 
jury becomes nothing more than an advisory board," Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom 
Borris maintained in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Borris, who prosecuted Massip, met Tuesday with fellow Deputy Dist. Attys. 
Michael Jacobs and Thomas Goethals, who oversee all appellate work in the 
Orange County district attorney's office, to discuss how to proceed in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, the prosecutors decided to move ahead with an appeal -- "an easy 
decision," Borris said. But they also mapped out specific points of attack in 
the case, and Jacobs, who will handle the appeal, plans to file papers today or 
Thursday with the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Believed She Was 'Bonkers' 
</P>
<P>
In an interview shortly after his ruling, Judge Fitzgerald said he felt 
justified in his decision because the evidence in Massip's 2-month trial 
clearly showed that she was "bonkers." According to the evidence, Massip first 
tried to throw her child into oncoming traffic, then hit him over the head with 
a tool and finally ran over him with the family car on April 29, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Postpartum psychosis -- a more severe and rarer form of the common "baby blues" 
-- is thought to prompt severe anxiety, delusions and even violence in about 
one to three of every 1,000 new mothers. 
</P>
<P>
Massip, the first woman in Southern California to test the postpartum psychosis 
defense at trial, said Tuesday: "I figured they would go for an appeal, but I 
just don't understand where the D.A.'s office is coming from, why they would 
take this case to this extreme and just keep beating it and beating it and 
beating it." 
</P>
<P>
Of the appeal itself, Massip said, "Whenever your life is on the line, you have 
to be worried, but I'm just trusting in the judge's decision." 
</P>
<P>
Her attorney, Milton C. Grimes of Santa Ana, said that although an appeal had 
been rumored since Fitzgerald's decision, he was still somewhat surprised to 
hear of the prosecutors' decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of thought that they would look at the big picture. I was just hoping 
that they would consider everything and look at what Sheryl's gone through and 
realize that this whole thing should be over," Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jury Independence Issue 
</P>
<P>
He discounted suggestions by prosecutors that the independence of juries is at 
stake in the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to trust in our judges. Just because Fitzgerald (reversed the 
conviction) doesn't mean that we should all get up in arms because judges are 
now going to arbitrarily do away with the jury system. That's a false fear 
that's being created," Grimes said. "The courts aren't going to turn to anarchy 
because of this case." 
</P>
<P>
Grimes added: "This appeal is really too bad for Sheryl. I know she and her 
family really wanted this wrapped up. This will be torture." 
</P>
<P>
But Borris said, "This now goes beyond Sheryl Massip's particular case; I'm 
concerned with the precedent that this whole things sets." 
</P>
<P>
The main thrust of the appeal will be that, while Fitzgerald could legitimately 
have granted Massip a new trial if he found fault with the jury's verdict, he 
"abused his discretion" by overturning it altogether, Borris said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's denied the prosecutor a jury trial," Borris said. "He doesn't have the 
authority to do what he did. He can't just willy-nilly reverse things." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alleged Abuse of Power 
</P>
<P>
Borris said he believes that Fitzgerald's reversal of the jury's finding that 
Massip was sane at the time of the killing offers prosecutors their strongest 
point for an appeal. But the appeal will also maintain that Fitzgerald abused 
his power by reducing her conviction before he found her not guilty by reason 
of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
In his decision last month, Fitzgerald first reduced the jury's verdict of 
second-degree murder -- for which Massip could have faced 25 years to life in 
state prison -- to the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter. He then 
vacated that conviction altogether by finding Massip not guilty by reason of 
insanity, meaning that Massip now faces only the prospect of court-ordered 
psychiatric care.

PUC WARNS OF LONG-DISTANCE SERVICE FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission warned consumers Tuesday that up to 
25 unauthorized companies may be trying to sell long-distance telephone 
services illegally in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Marco Valenti, manager of the PUC's consumer affairs branch, said the 
unauthorized companies seem to concentrate on residential customers and small 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, he said, the companies offer some form of flat fee for unlimited 
long-distance calling or discounts for signing up friends and relatives. In 
many cases, Valenti said, the firms lease only a few telephone lines from major 
long-distance carriers, and these lines soon become so crowded that customers 
find them constantly busy. 
</P>
<P>
Valenti also cited a case in which a consumer responded to a sales pitch by 
mailing $500 to an office address in Dallas -- only to find later, after 
contacting the PUC, that there was no record of any such company. The money has 
not been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Valenti urged consumers approached by representatives of long-distance 
companies with which they are unfamiliar to check with the PUC in Los Angeles 
((213) 620-2570) or in San Francisco ((415) 557-1048) to make sure that the 
firms are certified by the state. The state Department of Consumer Affairs also 
offers a booklet, "Choosing a Long-Distance Telephone Company," that can be 
ordered by calling (916) 445-1254. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of long-distance telephone companies have started selling service 
since the breakup of the Bell System 5 years ago, Valenti noted. The PUC 
certifies more than 120 firms to provide service in California. These companies 
are required to file their prices with the commission and to submit to state 
regulatory procedures.

FULLERTON RUNS AFOUL IN DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Cal State Fullerton's Mark Hill hit a 3-point shot that cut New Mexico 
State's lead to 4 points with 1 minute 46 seconds remaining Tuesday, the 
situation looked good for Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a problem. The Titans, who had come from 13 points behind, had 
committed only 4 team fouls. 
</P>
<P>
Before Fullerton sent New Mexico State to the free-throw line, 53 seconds 
passed. The Aggies then made 6 of 6 shots from the line in the final minute, 
taking a 65-60 victory in front of 1,603 in Titan Gym in the the Big West 
Conference opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
The foul situation presented a dilemma for Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans could try for a steal, all the while letting time run off the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Or they could foul quickly, putting New Mexico State closer to the bonus. But 
with the fifth and sixth foul, the Aggies got a new 45 seconds on the shot 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
"We got caught in a Catch-22," Coach John Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Fullerton rode the fence, trying for a steal for the first few 
passes and then fouling. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans had no luck either way. The Aggies protected the ball and hit their 
free throws, including 4 consecutive by Jimmy Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
The loss overshadowed a career-high 26-point performance by Hill, who tied a 
school record by making 6 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry Boagni made 6 3-pointers against New Mexico State in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Hill made 6 of 9 from 3-point range, and 2 of 3 from closer. He added 4 free 
throws in 6 attempts as he led the Titans in scoring for the second game in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
He also played tough defense on Jeff McCool, who had been leading the Aggies 
with a 14-point average, and was averaging 12 points a game from 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Against Fullerton, he scored only 6 points, making 1 of 2 from 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark played McCool well," Sneed said. "McCool knows where that 3-point line 
is, but Mark kept him away." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton has lost 4 in a row after a 5-1 start during which the Titans showed 
remarkable composure. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent games, the team has been in a state of flux. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cedric Ceballos, who averaged 25 points in his first 7 games, finished with 
12. Two games ago, he scored only 2 points in a double-overtime loss to New 
Orleans in a performance he called his worst since he was in grade school. He 
came back with 16 in a loss to St. Mary's Friday. Against New Mexico State, he 
made 4 of 16 shots from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 -- John Sykes, returning after a 1-game suspension for unspecified reasons, 
scored 14 points off the bench, making all 6 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Derek Jones, who had been the second-leading scorer in the early part of 
the season, struggled with foul trouble, picking up his third in the first half 
and finishing with a season-low 4 points. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And Wayne Williams, the freshman point guard who played a crucial part in 
two of Fullerton's early road victories, went scoreless for the second game in 
a row, missing all 5 shots, 4 from 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton will end its 6-game home stand with a game against Cal State Long 
Beach in Titan Gym Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We had lost 3 and they still came back to play tough tonight," Sneed said. 
"That's a good sign. It was a home game, the conference opener and a TV game, 
so that was motivation. We'll have motivation Thursday, because we don't want 
to go on the road without a win." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the third in a row for New Mexico State (8-3). 
</P>
<P>
Willie Joseph led the Aggies with 20 points, and Johnny Roberson added 15. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton rallied after falling behind by 13 less than 3 minutes into the 
second half after a 3-pointer by Taylor and a short jumper by Joseph at the 
start of the half gave New Mexico State its biggest lead, 39-26. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State had used a 13-0 run to take a 17-7 lead over the Titans during 
a first-half in which Fullerton made just 8 of 30 shots (27%). 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies made 16 of 28 (57%) in the half, and led, 34-26, at halftime.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
SYKES PREFERS TO PLAY HIS WAY FOR TITANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robyn Norwood 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Sykes, Cal State Fullerton's 6-foot 8-inch, 235-pound center, isn't 
versatile, consistent or always the easiest player to coach. 
</P>
<P>
But when he jogs onto the court in Titan Gym, he often gets the kind of cheer 
usually reserved for a player who scores far more than the 6 points a game 
Sykes averages. 
</P>
<P>
His repertoire of shots extends little beyond 2-handed dunks off offensive 
rebounds and 6-foot jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
His defense is sometimes punctuated by spectacular blocks, sometimes by 
unnecessary fouls. But the fans at Fullerton see something they like. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a spark plug, an inspirational player," said Dan Duir, a Titan fan. 
</P>
<P>
"He has no respect for authority," said Mark Salas of Placentia, another fan. 
"He's always in the dog house." 
</P>
<P>
Sykes' play this season has sometimes been a frustration to Coach John Sneed, 
who says Sykes has done some good things for Fullerton -- particularly 
rebounding, at 7 a game. But Sneed would like for Sykes to take fewer gambles 
on defense, to play straight up instead of taking the sort of chance Sykes 
relishes -- something along the lines of going for a block on an 18-foot 
jumper. 
</P>
<P>
Sykes claims that is just his nature. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I figure, everything's a gamble," Sykes said. "Life is a gamble 
sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Sykes is a player who has had his troubles. He was suspended for a game last 
week by Sneed for unspecified reasons. After missing the Titans' loss to St. 
Mary's Friday, Sykes returned to the team Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a misunderstanding between me and Coach Sneed," Sykes said. "We 
got it cleared up. He's there to do his job, and I'm there to do mine. We're 
back together." 
</P>
<P>
Sykes came to Fullerton last season, after earning a degree but not playing 
basketball at Merced College. He played at Texas his freshman year, but decided 
to leave, in part, he said, "because me and the coach didn't get along." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he started the first game of the season, became a reserve the next 
game, and for a time was replaced on the traveling roster by a walk-on. 
</P>
<P>
This season, he didn't start the first game, in part because he missed practice 
without an excuse over the Thanksgiving holiday. 
</P>
<P>
But he had started 3 games in a row before the suspension, scoring a 
career-high 14 points and pulling down 10 rebounds against New Orleans. But he 
also was called for goaltending on a crucial play late in the game, possibly 
costing Fullerton a victory. 
</P>
<P>
A joint effort with the Southern California Acro Team (SCATs), the Huntington 
Beach-based gymnastics school run by former Olympic Coach Don Peters, has been 
a boon to Fullerton gymnastics team fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
SCATs gymnasts have sold about 500 Fullerton gymnastics season tickets, most at 
$25 each, but including a number of VIP tickets at $50 each. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, women's Coach Lynn Rogers said, Fullerton sold about 20 season 
tickets last year. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the SCATs gymnasts who sold tickets were invited to a clinic put on 
by Fullerton that included instruction from nationally prominent coaches and 
gymnasts. 
</P>
<P>
"The message is that there is interest in gymnastics," Rogers said. "It just 
takes getting the word out." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans open the gymnastics season Jan. 20, with a women's meet against 
Stanford, and the men against San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
The women's basketball team, with a 9-1 record and an 8-game winning streak, 
moves into its Big West Conference schedule for good Thursday at UC Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans have played one conference game already, a victory over Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really happy with our start," Coach Maryalyce Jeremiah said. "But . . . 
that 9-1 mark doesn't have anything to do with now. . . . We're going to put 
that where it belongs -- on its own shelf. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a long way to go even to meet our record in conference games last 
year. I don't know if we can repeat that."

MISSION VIEJO-BASED S&amp;L'S ACQUIRER PLANS EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer

<P>
The chairman of Michigan National Corp. said Tuesday that the bank holding 
company plans to use newly acquired Beverly Hills Savings &amp; Loan of Mission 
Viejo as a vehicle for expanding operations throughout deposit-rich California. 
</P>
<P>
To Robert J. Mylod's way of thinking, the S&amp;L will soon be growing into one 
of California's larger savings institutions, and the prestige often associated 
with anything that has the Beverly Hills name attached to it will return. 
</P>
<P>
Mylod, the company's chairman, said he was "just delighted" over the purchase 
of insolvent, six-branch Beverly Hills Savings from federal regulators Saturday 
with $52 million of Michigan National's cash and $983 million in federal 
regulatory assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase was among a flurry of S&amp;L acquisitions approved last week as 
regulators rushed to clinch deals so that buyers could take advantage of tax 
credits available only to the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question we plan to build up the (S&amp;L's) business," Mylod said 
Tuesday in a telephone interview from Michigan National's new headquarters in 
the Detroit suburb of Farmington Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Federal laws and regulatory rules prohibit bank holding companies from 
acquiring healthy S&amp;Ls but allow them to buy failing ones. Once a banking 
firm buys a sick S&amp;L, it can use the S&amp;L to buy healthy savings 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
And Michigan National, which owns the highly profitable Michigan National Bank 
of Detroit, will use Beverly Hills Savings to "look for further acquisitions," 
Mylod said. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy has already worked for the nation's largest banking firm, 
Citicorp. In 1982, the New York firm bought the failed Fidelity Savings &amp; 
Loan in San Francisco and has since nearly tripled its size to $7.3 billion in 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
Mylod said it was too early to say if the company will turn Beverly Hills 
Savings into a banking operation once nationwide interstate banking is allowed 
in California in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"But we like the name Beverly Hills," he said. "We think over a time -- a very 
short time -- we can re-establish the image of that name." 
</P>
<P>
Michigan National also gets to use $793.7 million in tax credits amassed at 
Beverly Hills Savings to reduce the amount of taxes it has to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Those tax credits should come in handy for Michigan National, which had $9.1 
million in assets and earnings of $69.7 million in the first 9 months of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were a bank holding company, I'd look for entree into California, 
particularly when I could buy with somebody else's money," said Gerry Findley, 
a financial industry consultant in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
Findley believes taxpayers are paying now and will pay more later for the deals 
arranged by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and its deposit insurance arm, the 
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taxpayer Bailout 
</P>
<P>
By giving buyers tax credits, he said, the U.S. Treasury must obtain from other 
taxpayers the revenue that those healthy firms would have paid. And the FSLIC, 
which has committed about $39 billion to salvage failed S&amp;Ls, eventually 
will need a taxpayer bailout. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, it's a good deal for Michigan National -- practically 
all positive," Findley said. "The negatives fall on the people, the taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
But the tax relief wasn't the only reason the company wanted to buy an S&amp;L 
that even managers of Beverly Hills Savings thought was headed for the scrap 
heap. 
</P>
<P>
"We liked Beverly Hills because, from our analysis, it sits in a tremendous 
market, albeit a competitive market," Mylod said. "I think it's the strongest 
market in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
He also believes that the S&amp;L's name, taken from the affluent city where it 
was based before its headquarters were moved to Orange County, conjures up 
images of affluence, respect and solidity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loyal Depositors 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills Savings has a core of depositors who have been loyal ever since 
regulators seized the institution in April, 1985, Mylod said. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan National plans to use the S&amp;L to provide many of the same services 
in California that the company offers elsewhere in the country through an 
$8-billion mortgage operation, an investment advisory firm and a credit card 
operation with $1.2 billion in receivables. 
</P>
<P>
"We plan to build up the S&amp;L, but we're not going to do it on Day One 
because we have to get in there and become familiar with the operation and the 
people," Mylod said. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills Savings has been run by a management team hired by regulators 
from First Nationwide Savings in San Francisco. The team will remain for a 
short time to help with the transition, Mylod said, before they return to First 
Nationwide.

BROKERAGE BUYS CONTROL OF IRVINE'S CYCLE INDUSTRIES; 
</P>
<P>
MERRILL LYNCH TURNS BULLISH ON SURFWEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Merrill Lynch is hitting the surf. 
</P>
<P>
The big brokerage house with the button-down image has become majority owner of 
an Irvine company that owns Off Shore Sportswear, a surfwear manufacturer, and 
holds licenses to produce Hobie T-shirts and Catchit T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner &amp; Smith bought the interest in Cycle Industries 
-- and its surfwear labels -- several weeks ago from Steve MacBaisey, Cycle's 
founder. MacBaisey, Cycle employees and Ex-Sto Capital, an investment banking 
house, also own interests in Cycle, MacBaisey said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
MacBaisey on Tuesday confirmed reports of the sale, which was completed in 
November, but declined to reveal financial details. Merrill Lynch officials 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
MacBaisey will continue to run the company as chairman, chief executive and 
president under a 4-year management contract. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch's entree into surfwear marks the second major shake-up recently 
in the volatile industry, which has hit rough waters in the last 2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Catchit -- a Tustin-based manufacturer of surf trunks, board shorts and a 
women's line called Haute Rush -- was sold Dec. 22 for an undisclosed sum by 
Pacific Trail of Seattle to its founder and president, Ian Forman, and two 
other investors. The company has been in a slump for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Catchit owns the rights to its T-shirt line and now will collect royalties from 
its sub-licensees, including Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
The changes are seen as more evidence of a financial wipeout within the 
$1-billion-a-year surfwear business. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been an oversaturation of the beach look in the marketplace, and it's 
a cyclical industry," said Glenn Mounger, president of the Mounger Corp. in 
Seattle, parent company of Pacific Trail. "When everybody jumps on a product, 
the uniqueness isn't there. The consumer got tired of it." 
</P>
<P>
Forman, the Catchit founder, acknowledged that the firm's sales were "flat" 
last year and that the company lost money. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank-based Hobie Apparel -- which licenses its entire line, including 
T-shirts -- has retail sales of about $120 million and is doing well -- 
particularly in such chains as Mervyn's and J.C. Penney, industry observers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Off Shore and Catchit have suffered among surfwear retailers in the last 2 
years, according to some industry insiders. 
</P>
<P>
"Off Shore and Catchit mean nothing -- they've been gone for years," said Paul 
Heussenstamm, owner of Newport Surf &amp; Sport in Newport Beach, a leading 
retailer and industry trend-setter. "Two years ago, I used to buy a ton from 
Catchit. But their line got real bad -- bad design, bad quality, poor taste." 
</P>
<P>
To revive the lines, Merrill Lynch and MacBaisey will have to increase sales of 
the labels to such major retail outlets as Walmart, Sears and J.C. Penney, 
Heussenstamm said. 
</P>
<P>
While he declined to discuss strategy, MacBaisey predicted that Cycle 
Industries' sales will climb 25% in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Cycle was founded as a silk-screening company by MacBaisey about 10 years ago. 
Today, about 65% of its business is silk-screening of clothing made by others, 
MacBaisey said, while the remaining 35% is manufacturing, including the Off 
Shore line of surfwear. 
</P>
<P>
Industry sources estimated Cycle's retail revenue at $30 million to $40 million 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
According to MacBaisey, Cycle is "probably the most profitable garment 
manufacturer in California."

DENNY'S TRANSFERRING HEADQUARTERS TO IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Denny's Inc. said Tuesday that it has sold its headquarters in La Mirada and 
will move to the Park Place office complex in Irvine once owned by Fluor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Denny's said it would use most of the proceeds to help remodel its coffee shop 
chain -- the nation's largest. 
</P>
<P>
The company's 610 corporate employees, who also oversee the El Pollo Loco 
restaurant chain, are scheduled to move into 160,000 square feet of leased 
office space in the former Fluor Corp. headquarters in Irvine in July, said C. 
Bruce Evans, Denny's vice president-development. Winchell's Donut Houses, which 
is 42% owned by Denny's, will remain in the La Mirada complex. 
</P>
<P>
The 22.5-acre complex in La Mirada was bought by Trammell Crow Co., a 
Dallas-based commercial developer, for an undisclosed price. The site includes 
several structures, including a four-story office building and Denny's, El 
Pollo Loco and Winchell's outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Trammell Crow in turn signed Denny's to a $50-million lease at Park Place, 
which Trammell Crow and a Boston investment firm, First Winthrop Associates, 
bought in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Trammell Crow refused to disclose the length of the lease. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant company will be the third-largest of 45 tenants at the building, 
after Fluor and Avco Financial Services. 
</P>
<P>
"The current surplus of office space in Orange County enabled us to lease a 
high-quality, competitively priced facility with an excellent location for the 
future," said Evans of Denny's. 
</P>
<P>
Trammell Crow has permission to build five more office towers on the property, 
which is near the San Diego Freeway. Awaiting Irvine's approval are 1,400 
residential units, a hotel, a cinema, restaurants and retail space. 
</P>
<P>
Evans said Trammell plans to keep some existing buildings on the Denny's site 
in La Mirada, including the three restaurants, while possibly developing vacant 
portions of the parcel. Trammell Crow officials were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Denny's had not been using the La Mirada complex "to its full potential," Evans 
said. "The proceeds will mainly be used for remodeling our existing 
restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
Denny's, which is owned by New York-based TW Services, has said it plans to 
spend $25 million to $30 million annually in the 5 years to remodel many of its 
1,200 coffee shops. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Coniston Partners, which is seeking to take over TW Services, said 
it would no longer insist on approval from TW's directors before proceeding 
with its $1.4-billion offer. The board's approval of a negotiated acquisition 
would have lowered the price of a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
But Coniston's offer is still contingent on TW revoking its so-called poison 
pill defense, which would make a takeover prohibitively expensive.

AMERICAN HEALTH SERVICES ACQUIRES DIAGNOSTICS FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Health Services Corp., based in Newport Beach, said Tuesday that it 
has completed its previously announced acquisition of American Diagnostics 
Group in Florida in a deal valued at $13.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition was paid for in a combination of cash, notes and debt 
assumption. 
</P>
<P>
American Diagnostics, with annual revenue of just over $7 million, was a 
subsidiary of American Capital Group Inc. It specializes in medical diagnostic 
imaging -- computer tomography scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, 
mammography and ultrasound -- and in radiation therapy. It has fixed and mobile 
operations servicing 18 hospitals in Indiana, Ohio, Florida, Mississippi and 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
American Health Services has 13 medical imaging centers in operation, under 
construction or in development. The company anticipated 1988 revenue of about 
$16 million. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of American Diagnostics makes American Health Services the 
largest operator of fixed-site, hospital-affiliated diagnostic centers in the 
country, American Health Services said. 
</P>
<P>
S. Lewis Meyer, president and chief executive officer of American Health 
Services, said the acquisition should enable his company to "achieve revenues 
in excess of $30 million for calendar year 1989."

MORE THAN HALF OF PRIME SHARES TENDERED, MAI SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAI Basic Four said Tuesday that it has received more than 50% of Prime 
Computer's common shares and that it expects resolution this month of two court 
cases obstructing its $970-million hostile bid to acquire the Massachusetts 
minicomputer firm. 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with the 4% of Prime stock that Tustin-based MAI owns outright, the 
tendered shares would give the company apparent control of Prime. 
</P>
<P>
But William S. Patton Jr., MAI's president, said Tuesday that it "is academic 
right now how much is tendered" because of the pending court cases. 
</P>
<P>
Prime sued MAI in federal court in Massachusetts on Nov. 22, seeking to block 
MAI's tender offer to acquire 67% or more of Prime's stock at $20 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, MAI has filed suit in state Chancery Court in Delaware, where Prime 
is incorporated, to overturn Prime's so-called poison pill anti-takeover 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
MAI officials have said in the past that they would not pursue the acquisition 
unless Prime's poison pill was neutralized. And MAI's tender offer is 
conditioned on its being able to obtain at least 67% of Prime's shares, a goal 
it has not yet met. 
</P>
<P>
In the federal case, U.S. District Judge David Mazzone on Thursday refused to 
lift a Dec. 13 preliminary injunction that blocks MAI's bid. 
</P>
<P>
Mazzone said he wants more information from MAI and its backers about how the 
deal would be financed and whether the financing plan would violate federal 
regulations limiting the amount of borrowed money that can be used to acquire 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
Financing for the tender offer is being arranged by Drexel Burnham Lambert, 
which 2 weeks ago agreed to plead guilty to federal felony charges arising from 
an investigation of insider trading activities. As part of the agreement, 
Drexel will pay a $650-million fine. 
</P>
<P>
Mazzone said the agreement raised questions about Drexel's financial condition 
"and its ability to obtain the financing needed" for MAI to acquire Prime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offer Extended to Jan. 11 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Patton said he expects all of Mazzone's questions to be answered 
this month, perhaps as soon as the middle of next week. 
</P>
<P>
Prime officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
MAI's tender offer recently was extended until Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
But if the federal case or the Delaware case -- or both -- still have not been 
resolved by then, Patton said it is "probable" that MAI would extend its tender 
offer once again. 
</P>
<P>
He said that 24.2 million of Prime's shares -- 50.1% of the total outstanding 
-- had been tendered to MAI as of Friday and that additional shares had been 
tendered by Tuesday. Together with the 4% of Prime's shares that MAI owns, the 
Tustin computer maker potentially controls more than 54% of Prime's stock. 
</P>
<P>
Although the federal injunction makes that control a moot issue right now, 
Patton said he believes that the amount of stock being tendered shows that 
Prime shareholders have faith in MAI's ability to finance the deal and believe 
that the price being offered is a good one. 
</P>
<P>
But several stock analysts have said the sluggish movement of Prime's stock 
price indicates that the investment community is far from convinced of the 
worthiness of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Prime's shares have stayed below MAI's $20 offer, closing Tuesday on the New 
York Stock Exchange at $18.50, up $1 for the day but still $1.50 lower than MAI 
is offering. 
</P>
<P>
"It would mean something if 99.5% of the shares had been tendered," Barry 
Bosak, an analyst in New York with the Robert Fleming brokerage, said. "That 
would probably have a bearing on the judge's ultimate decision because it would 
show overwhelming shareholder approval" of MAI's offer. 
</P>
<P>
Bosak said Prime's announcement last week that it would lay off about 1,200 
workers in an effort to cut costs and increase profits appears to have driven 
up the stock price. 
</P>
<P>
MAI's shares, also traded on the New York exchange, closed unchanged for the 
day Tuesday at $8.50.

FOLK DANCE FESTIVAL TAKING ITS LAST KICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 44 years ago, while watching Trinidad's ethnic dancers celebrate in the 
streets at carnival time, Los Angeles impresario Irwin Parnes had a brainstorm. 
Why not create a folk dance festival back home, where there was an equally rich 
diversity of ethnic groups? 
</P>
<P>
He dispatched a special delivery letter outlining the plan to his friend, Paul 
Erfer of the Southern California Folk Dance Federation. But the reply was 
discouraging. The federation had no money to sponsor such an event, Erfer 
wrote, and in any case, "Folk dancers like to participate, not watch (others)." 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Parnes launched the Los Angeles International Folk Dance Festival in 
1947 at the old Philharmonic Auditorium, an annual phenomenon that has lasted 
42 years. But Saturday's performance at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in the 
Music Center will be the finale. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a time of financial subsidies for various cultural events," Parnes 
said recently in his Beverly Hills home. "The folk dance festival has never 
received one dime from anybody, and we've come to the point where we can't 
compete against all these thousands of dollars that are going to various other 
festivals and street programs. 
</P>
<P>
"In San Francisco, the Ethnic Dance Festival uses the hotel tax to do the very 
same thing we are doing here strictly based upon our box office." 
</P>
<P>
Parnes said the event is now budgeted at between $30,000 and $40,000, primarily 
for rental costs at the Music Center. The dance groups -- which together total 
as many as 600 to 700 performers -- are paid expenses only. ("We see that all 
of their costs are covered, whether it's travel or baby-sitters or costume 
repairs.") 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, although he never signed a contract with any of the groups, none 
has ever failed to appear. His practice of avoiding auditions and simply taking 
each company at its word yielded some unfortunate surprises in the early years, 
however. One company promised an Iranian fire dance but performed a classical 
pastiche in toe shoes. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 years ago, the festival finally began to limit participation to 
performers with a decade of onstage experience. But as Parnes insists, "In the 
world of folk dance, the amateur is king." 
</P>
<P>
So along with such seasoned ethnic dancers as Devi Dja, Rosa Montoya, Lola 
Montes and Tokuyae Hanayagi, the festival showcased hundreds of ordinary folk 
who simply enjoyed celebrating a foreign heritage -- their own, or someone 
else's. 
</P>
<P>
The 1961 program struck one reviewer as primarily "an aggregation of American 
folk dance enthusiasts who called themselves by a different name according to 
the country from which their dance originated . . . with slight shifts in 
personnel and appropriate costume changes." 
</P>
<P>
The festival also featured animal acts from time to time because, Parnes said, 
"We have a public we must entertain." 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, a horse named Top Hat trotted out pulling a cart and proceeded to 
dance a polonaise, polka, schottische, clog dance, hora and tango. Accompanied 
by a recording of John Philip Sousa's "Stars and Stripes Forever," a "chorus 
line" of trained pigeons painted red, white and blue flew out of the carriage. 
</P>
<P>
At another festival, eight women do-si-doed with a group of French poodles -- 
all in Western costume. Billed as an American square dance, this act drew 
indignant mail from the French consul general, according to Parnes. The 
gentleman insisted the poodles be credited to his country. 
</P>
<P>
A Haitian voodoo ritual with a live chicken was the piece de resistance one 
year, Parnes recalled. Tossed around in an unusually strenuous sacrificial 
ceremony, the animal expired. Parnes asked a performer, one Le Roi Antoine, if 
he'd like to take the chicken home and eat it. Antoine was appalled. "I will 
not eat a fellow performer!" he cried. 
</P>
<P>
The festival also didn't limit itself to folk material. In 1958 Cuban ballroom 
dancers offered a sultry mambo and in 1965 Los Angeles teen-agers demonstrated 
the barbaric rites of the twist, Watusi, mashed potato and jerk. 
</P>
<P>
Modern dancers also occasionally shared the bill, beginning in 1947 with Ruth 
St. Denis in her Asian-inspired "White Jade" dance. 
</P>
<P>
St. Denis was in her mid-80s in 1964 when she appeared in the festival for the 
last time. Although a review describes her as "gliding grandly across the 
stage" in the role of Kwannon, Japanese goddess of mercy, she was actually 
unable to walk. An assistant carried her as she used gestures and facial 
expressions to conjure up the essence of the young goddess. 
</P>
<P>
"(St. Denis) was an incredible actress," Parnes' wife Joy recalled. "Of course, 
she was the mother of modern dance, which she hated. She would say it was a 
'put' school: you put your hand here, you put your foot there. Because 
everything she did was flowing, like the scarfs she used." 
</P>
<P>
Modern dancer Charles Weidman, a pupil of St. Denis', performed in the festival 
three years later, billed as "America's dance mime," in a number called "A 
Chinese Actor Prepares for the Role of God of War." A reviewer remarked tartly 
that in this "arty exercise" Weidman "writhed and postured incomprehensibly." 
</P>
<P>
"Weidman was a tremendous mime," Joy Parnes said. "He was, I think, the 
equivalent of Harpo (Marx), and no one ever realized it. They always presented 
him as a modern dancer and that was death at the box office in those days." 
</P>
<P>
During the first few years, reviewers tended to complain about the epic length 
of the program. Eventually, a six-minute rule was instituted, but getting 
dancers to abide by it could be a challenge -- particularly when stirred into a 
frenzy by live drummers. 
</P>
<P>
An aid in pacing the show and conveying basic information about the dances, Joy 
Parnes' festival script was narrated by a different celebrity each year, 
beginning with Vincent Price. (Other Hollywood luminaries cajoled into service 
included Greer Garson, Ralph Bellamy, Ricardo Montalban, Eartha Kitt, Ginger 
Rogers, Edward G. Robinson and Ruby Keeler, who bravely hoisted herself to the 
podium while recovering from a stroke.) 
</P>
<P>
"We have one company offstage and one company on, so I'm allowed about four 
lines to introduce the next company," Joy Parnes explained. "Meanwhile, there's 
a mad dash backstage and then the chorus comes in and sings one verse -- and by 
that time, God willing, the curtain comes up." 
</P>
<P>
This year, the curtain is supposed to go up for the last time on the Jora 
Makarian Sevan Armenians, the company scheduled to end the final program. But 
the dancers are officially in mourning for their kin killed in the Armenian 
earthquake and may not be able to participate. 
</P>
<P>
What if they can't? "We'll find a group that will be maybe not as great, but 
good," said Parnes, who retires with the festival. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, however, the festival has insulated itself from the problems 
of the real world. Parnes presented Japanese dancers a week after the bombing 
of Pearl Harbor. He says he also ignored Red-baiters' phone calls in the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
"This is about brotherhood," Parnes said. "It has nothing to do with politics." 
</P>
<P>
The important part, added his wife, is "keeping our cultural heritage alive in 
a day when basket-makers keep their braid in Tupperware and Irish folk talers 
listen to the radio."

SPY IN L.A. UNSETTLES 'INDUSTRY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Who is Celia Brady and why is she saying all those terrible things about 
Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
Brady is the pseudonymous show business columnist for Spy magazine, the 
2-year-old New York-based satirical monthly that startled the journalism world 
with its cutting-down-to-size exposes about the Rich and Famous. And some of 
Brady's recent jabs at moviedom's high and mighty published under the heading 
"The Industry" include claims that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Die Hard" movie producer Joel Silver is a "taste-free bullyboy" whose 
"involvement in the movies is justified on the dubious grounds that one needs a 
larger-than-life producer (read: manipulative despot) to deal with the 
industry's larger-than-life talents (read: manipulative despots)." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Creative Artists Agency chief Michael Ovitz is a "personality-free" power 
monger, who rarely deserves mention without his stock epithet: "The 
Manipulator." 
</P>
<P>
 -- NBC executive Brandon Tartikoff was plotting with "short-fingered vulgarian 
Donald Trump" about taking over a studio. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And Columbia Pictures Entertainment CEO Victor (The Briefcase) Kaufman "has 
apparently begun to weary" of Columbia President Dawn Steel's "tirades. Next 
stop for Steel: an independent production deal within 12 to 15 months." 
</P>
<P>
The question of Brady's identity isn't just a matter of bemused speculation. So 
caustic has been Brady's pen and so high-placed her victims that one powerful 
agent is widely rumored to have put a private detective on her trail. (After 
all, Brady frequently ends her columns with the teasing line "See you Monday 
night at Morton's.") 
</P>
<P>
E. Graydon Carter, editor of Spy along with Kurt Andersen, claims Ovitz offered 
Rupert Murdoch's publication about the movie industry, Premiere magazine, "an 
interesting internal document" in exchange for Brady's identity, apparently 
thinking that journalists could ferret out the information. But a Premiere 
editor believed the offer was actually made by only a "CAA underling," who was 
apparently bucking for a promotion. A Creative Artists Agency spokesman denied 
that the document incident took place. 
</P>
<P>
Still others, in particular Hollywood producers, screenwriters and even some 
journalists, worry that they are unjustly under suspicion of complicity with 
the column and their projects will suffer as a result. 
</P>
<P>
But Andersen and Carter, both former staffers at Time Inc., boast that the real 
reason for the furor is that "The Industry" column is finally providing the 
hard-ball reporting that Hollywood's megalomania deserves. And they can get 
away with it, Carter says, "because Spy was designed as a magazine that could 
exist without the access that most celebrity-driven magazines must have. We 
don't need Morgan Fairchild's publicist to be friends with us to put out this 
magazine each month." 
</P>
<P>
Although the magazine has only 130,000 subscribers, its articles make the 
rounds by word of mouth among the trendier folks in New York and Los Angeles. 
And what gets their attention is Brady's irreverence toward the sacred cows of 
Hollywood -- studio executives and producers. 
</P>
<P>
But much as the magazine editors claim to loathe Hollywood, they also seem to 
be embracing it. Since its inception, Spy has retained the International 
Creative Management talent agency for its book tie-ins. But only within the 
past year and a half has the magazine used that firm's L.A. office to pursue 
production deals. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Spy is planning an HBO television special to spotlight the magazine's 
caustic/comic subject matter, according to Esther Newberg, an ICM agent in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a very strong client. We consider them one of the hottest items in 
town," says Newberg. 
</P>
<P>
And it remains to be seen whether producers will try to dangle fat deals before 
the magazine in hopes of avoiding Brady's lash. For instance, editor Andersen 
says it was "purely coincidental" that Brady's May, 1988, column actually said 
something nice about producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber after their 
representatives had met with Carter and Andersen last spring about, in 
Andersen's words, "possibly doing a TV show together." 
</P>
<P>
"Before, during and since then, we've had unkind things to say about them," 
Andersen says. 
</P>
<P>
But the editor does acknowledge that the possibility of conflict of interest is 
a real issue. Making Hollywood deals, he says, also "makes it more difficult to 
be utterly impartial if we do indeed have any kind of ongoing involvement with 
TV. It would be disingenuous to say there would be no applied pressure. It gets 
dicier, certainly, when you're not entirely an outsider. And it's something 
we're concerned about and will endeavor to not have cloud our judgments." 
</P>
<P>
What makes it easier, he notes, is that the Brady column "is not written by us 
or generated in-house, which keeps it at arm's length from our discussions." 
</P>
<P>
Carter and Andersen swear up and down that Brady, whose name is taken from the 
narrator in F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Last Tycoon," is "one person" and not a 
composite. 
</P>
<P>
They also say the columnist is not a Hollywood agent, despite widespread 
speculation to the contrary, and even claim the individual is writing a 
screenplay under the Celia Brady name. 
</P>
<P>
Associates of the editors say the pair closely guard the identity of the 
columnist even from magazine insiders. 
</P>
<P>
"I've asked (Gray and Andersen) many, many times, and they won't tell me," says 
contributing editor Paul Rudnick, who has occasionally been fingered himself as 
a possible Brady contributor -- which he says he isn't. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, several other Spy insiders say they are virtually certain that Brady 
is a composite -- essentially, a voice invented by the editors, who do most of 
the writing, based on reports drawn from a number of sources, including at 
least a couple of "Deep Throats" from Hollywood's agency and executive ranks. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that this column seems to me like a composite," says Lynn 
Hirschberg, a Spy contributor who edited the magazine's Los Angeles "Life-Style 
Hell" September issue. Hirschberg denies being Brady, but will neither confirm 
nor deny whether she contributes to the column. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Lyne, editor of Premiere magazine, says it is her understanding that Spy 
is using a "Harvard Mafia" (Andersen went to Harvard) and also some prep school 
connections on the West Coast to "deliver lots and lots of choice morsels to 
them. There are, in fact, 15 or 20 people feeding into it every month." 
</P>
<P>
Carter acknowledges that he does "weave" stories from people other than the 
alleged Brady into the column. Entertainment executives and journalists say 
they've received calls from males and females identifying themselves as "Spy's 
Celia Brady." Andersen says the calls were probably from members of the 
magazine's fact-checking staff. 
</P>
<P>
Claiming the column, as the rest of the magazine, is carefully edited, Spy's 
editors like to boast that "The Industry's" mix of unattributed reporting and 
vituperative comment has yet to be hit with a libel suit. 
</P>
<P>
But it certainly isn't perfect. To begin with, Fitzgerald's mythical narrator 
was actually named Cecilia Brady. And, on close examination, other factual 
misfires do occur. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, a potshot at New York Times entertainment writer Aljean Harmetz 
in the December column appears to miss the mark. Brady accuses Harmetz of 
foolishly quoting Variety's Art Murphy to the effect that any picture grossing 
$30 million or more at the box office at the time of its video release would be 
a financial success. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it would have been too taxing for Harmetz to think through this 
assertion and consider, say, pictures that cost more than $30 million to make," 
sniped Brady. 
</P>
<P>
Guess again, Celia. 
</P>
<P>
What Harmetz actually wrote was: "Mr. Murphy considers $30 million to be the 
threshold for success when a movie is released on videocassette." In other 
words, $30 million in ticket sales usually means a successful run at the video 
store, which is a pretty innocuous and seemingly correct assertion. 
</P>
<P>
And, in the latest issue, Brady's column contains a glaring oversight when it 
claims Lorimar film chief Bernie Brillstein and "his arch-nemesis" Michael 
Ovitz at Creative Artists Agency are still feuding. Actually, if Brady were as 
hooked into Hollywood as she would have people believe, she would know that the 
two men smoothed over their feud last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Still, those Hollywood types who are reading Brady -- or the multiple Bradys -- 
are doing so avidly and/or angrily. "I laugh along with everybody else. It's 
fun to make fun of powerful people," says the president of one talent agency. 
</P>
<P>
Just as clearly, Hollywood is churning with a certain amount of fear of being 
ridiculed by Brady and Spy. "Please don't mention my name," says the same 
agent. "I have this nightmare that I'll be the only agent quoted in your story, 
and they'll come after me." 
</P>
<P>
(Some of the journalistic set seem to share the apprehension. "If you write 
about (Celia Brady), they'll come after you next. . . . And forget my name," 
warns one Vanity Fair staffer, who claims to know "exactly" who the columnist 
is.) 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the column may be giving less grief to its subjects than to those 
people suspected, rightly or wrongly, of contributing to it. Among those who 
complain they are being hurt by false suspicion of involvement with Brady are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Producer-journalist Lynda Obst. "I have not been and never will be a gossip 
columnist," Obst ("Adventures in Babysitting") says angrily of the persistent 
rumor that she is Celia Brady. A former New York Times editor who still writes 
occasionally for Premiere and other magazines, Obst says she doesn't believe in 
"unattributed gossip" and finds it "upsetting" that Hollywood peers have 
questioned her about writing for Spy. "I pray you get (Brady's identity)," she 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Journalist-screenwriter Bruce Feirstein. "This is a terrifying thought. . . 
. I earn my living in Hollywood. . . . How do I clear my name of this?" 
Feirstein ("Real Men Don't Eat Quiche") said when informed that four movie 
producers had privately expressed suspicion that he was contributing and had 
been a major source for Brady's Joel Silver column. The suspicion seems 
natural: Feirstein is listed on Spy's masthead as a contributing editor, and he 
has stayed in touch with Silver since the two went to high school in Maplewood, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
But Feirstein, who also writes for movies and TV, said he doesn't contribute to 
the column, doesn't know who does and doesn't really like Spy's uglier side, 
despite his friendship with Spy editor Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Warner Bros. executive Lisa Henson. The rumor mill has similarly tried to 
tag Henson apparently because she went to Harvard with Spy executive editor 
Susan Morrison. Henson, the daughter of muppeteer Jim Henson, didn't return 
calls. But one friend explained that she doesn't contribute, because she 
doesn't want to compromise her position at Warner Bros. or in the industry in 
such an obvious way, and that she is "deeply distressed" by the talk. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Journalist-screenwriter Jean Vallely. "Everybody thinks it's me. I swear 
it's not!" says Vallely. A contributing editor to the Los Angeles Times 
Magazine and former columnist for GQ magazine, Vallely is working on a TV movie 
for CBS and a fiction book about Hollywood. She attributes the suspicion to her 
once having "sat next to Graydon (Carter) at dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some are eager to meet Brady for other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Corkery, another journalist-screenwriter and a sometime Spy contributor 
who makes a few of the suspect lists says, "I hope she's real. . . . I'd like 
to date her." 
</P>
<P>
And Premiere's Lyne says: "If you find out who it is, tell me. I'll hire her." 
</P>
<P>
Got that, Celia? 
</P>
<P>
See you Tuesday night at Trumps.

WORKSHOP TURNS WOULD-BE WRITERS INTO THE REAL THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MATHEWS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
J. B. Mackey, a 48-year-old drifter who felt he had a lot of stories to tell, 
was living off the aluminum cans and junk iron he picked up along the road in 
west Texas when he heard about it. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Homans, a 24-year-old college graduate who had hoped to write the 
definitive treatise on Western religion, was counting engine parts in a 
Baltimore warehouse when he heard about it. 
</P>
<P>
Months after they heard about it, it had changed their lives. Both Homans and 
Mackey have become working writers, professionals with tax returns to prove it. 
They have sold screenplays. 
</P>
<P>
How did this happen? What was it that added these dissimilar men to the 
Hollywood work force? 
</P>
<P>
The answer in a moment. First, we'll introduce a third character -- Willard 
Rodgers, one of 12 children of a sharecropper family in Arkansas. Thirty years 
ago, Rodgers was one of three young men singled out and told at an assembly of 
about 300 recruits that they were not smart enough to belong to the United 
States Navy. 
</P>
<P>
"I made the lowest score of all," said Rodgers, adding that he had tested at a 
third-grade level. "I ran all the way back to the barracks crying, crawled 
under my bed and swore this would never happen again." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't happen again. Rodgers managed to stay in the Navy by promising to 
take correspondence courses, and by the time his four-year tour was up, he was 
testing at a 10th-grade level. After he was out of the Navy, he finished high 
school, went to junior college, got a degree in anthropology at Cal State 
Fullerton, studied social work at UC Berkeley as a Woodrow Wilson Fellow, then 
earned his master's degree in theater arts from USC. 
</P>
<P>
All of which was good for Homans and Mackey, Oscar-winning writers Sterling 
Silliphant ("In the Heat of the Night") and Edward Anhalt ("Becket") and dozens 
of others in Hollywood, because Rodgers eventually launched the American Film 
Institute Alumni Assn. Writers Workshop, which has helped them all. 
</P>
<P>
"I am glad you're doing this story. Maybe I'll learn something about 
(Rodgers)," said Silliphant, who has moderated several of the workshop programs 
and who said he has had problems with one of his own scripts solved by the 
process. "He is not a pushy guy. He doesn't promote himself. He just quietly 
goes about his business and he runs a wonderful program." 
</P>
<P>
Homans and Mackey are two of the would-be writers who would almost certainly 
not have had a break in Hollywood without Rodgers' help. 
</P>
<P>
Homans had written something he thought was a script about a Little League 
baseball star, but didn't know what to do with it until he read a blurb about 
the workshop in Writer's Digest. He sent his material in with the $50 
application fee and six months later had an agent at William Morris, an option 
at Lorimar and an apartment at the bottom of the hill below the Hollywood sign. 
</P>
<P>
It was a newspaper article about Homans' success that caught Mackey's eye in 
Texas. That day, Mackey and his wife jumped into their van and headed West with 
their worldly possessions, which included Mackey's story about a sociopathic 
child and his demonic dog. 
</P>
<P>
Homans' script, "Umpire," languished at Lorimar and has not been produced, but 
it has put Homans in the game. Mackey's script, "Mac and Tanker," is scheduled 
to go into production early this year. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Homans nor Mackey had a clue as to the form or requirements of a 
screenplay. Homans turned in what read like a 200-page essay, Rodgers said. 
Mackey had 50 pages of hand-written notes with dialogue. But both had what 
Rodgers considered cinematic story lines and he accepted them into the program. 
</P>
<P>
"I look for that raw talent," Rodgers said. "I can teach somebody the 
screenplay form in three hours. But it won't help if they don't have a story." 
</P>
<P>
Although a couple of major films -- "Cross Roads" and "River's Edge" -- have 
emerged from workshop readings, the workshop itself is one of Hollywood's best 
kept secrets. The 48-year-old program director does not promote it well; he 
can't afford to. The annual budget is just $45,000, out of which come office 
expenses, a secretary's salary and $12,000 worth of routine mailings announcing 
workshop schedules. Whatever's left is Rodgers' salary. 
</P>
<P>
"When you add in Xeroxing and some other things, it's a tough way to make a 
living," he said during an interview in the space that has been donated to him 
in a one-time funeral home adjacent to the old MGM lot in Culver City. "I have 
been able to take as much as $6,000 in salary, but my wife works and I sell 
something myself once in a while. It's working out fine." 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers, himself a graduate of the American Film Institute's directors' 
program, started the AFI Alumni Assn. Writers Workshop eight years ago, 
convincing the alumni board that talented starting writers could benefit from a 
process that begins with professional supervision of their scripts and ends 
with a reading by professional actors and an audience critique. 
</P>
<P>
The actual format of the workshop had to be created because nothing like it had 
apparently been done before. Rodgers had worked in theater where readings were 
routine. But it wasn't being done for film. 
</P>
<P>
"There had not been one word written on staging a screenplay before a live 
audience," Rodgers said. "Live readings are valuable in giving writers 
feedback. Sometimes, you just don't know what the problems are until an 
audience tells you." 
</P>
<P>
Anhalt and Silliphant were in business long before Rodgers formed the workshop, 
but they have both found it useful. After serving several times as volunteer 
moderators of post-reading critiques, both writers put themselves through 
readings. 
</P>
<P>
"I had written a screenplay for an Australian producer and it ended up on the 
shelf," Silliphant said. "I felt the script was flawed but I truly didn't know 
what was the matter with the piece. Willard took it and his actors performed it 
before 300 or 400 people." 
</P>
<P>
Anhalt moderated the Silliphant reading, and Silliphant said there was the 
usual 10 or 15 minutes of praise before the audience began listing the script's 
faults. 
</P>
<P>
"They made some wonderfully direct points that had never occurred to me," 
Silliphant said. "I don't know what I'll do with that script, but I know how to 
do it now. It gave me peace of mind." 
</P>
<P>
The Silliphant and Anhalt readings were "showcase" readings, Rodgers said. They 
drew larger audiences, and at $8 per person, helped defray some expenses. But 
virtually all other readings represent net losses to the workshop. 
</P>
<P>
For a writer accepted into the program, the most he or she will spend to 
complete it -- to receive a live reading -- is $450. Rodgers estimates the 
actual cost for each "graduate" at $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
The deficit is made up by contributions from the most likely beneficiaries -- 
Hollywood's talent agencies, independent production companies and major 
studios. 
</P>
<P>
The entire workshop process can take less than six months, depending on the 
original condition of the script and how hard and fast the writer works. 
Rodgers reads the scripts first, then sends them out to professional writers he 
has enlisted as volunteers. When the script is far enough along, it is 
scheduled for one of the two readings currently held each month. 
</P>
<P>
After a final rewrite, done with audience feedback in mind, Rodgers has the 
scripts duplicated and sent out to his regular customers. He said he has 39 
companies and agencies that will read every workshop script submitted to them. 
</P>
<P>
When scripts are bought, or put into development, the writers are obligated to 
return 5% of their earnings from those projects to the program. This doesn't 
happen often -- even with help, script sales are like winning lottery numbers 
-- but when it does, there is little complaining. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Strum, who had worked in retail merchandising before quitting to try 
screen writing, said he is going beyond his written commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"I've told Willard that in the next couple of years, whatever comes in, I'm 
giving 5% of it back," Strom said. "This has been fantastic for me." 
</P>
<P>
Strom didn't go through the regular workshop program. He joined a group 
organized by Rodgers to coach writers on selling their ideas. Strom spent $50 
for the practical experience of verbally pitching his stories to other writers, 
then met with production executives lined up by Rodgers and did it for real. 
</P>
<P>
Within two months, Strom said he had two development deals -- one with veteran 
independent producer Joe Wizan, the other with Jerry Weintraub's Weintraub 
Entertainment Group. 
</P>
<P>
The successes of Strom, Mackey and Homans are not the norm for the workshop. 
The rule-of-thumb in Hollywood is that one out of 100 developed scripts 
actually gets produced, and though several of Rodgers writers have made money 
from options and development deals, few workshop scripts have been produced as 
either TV shows or feature films. 
</P>
<P>
But the process unquestionably improves both the writing and the odds. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing your writing acted out in front of an audience gives you a sense of its 
impact," said Oliver Stone, who moderated the reading for Neil Jiminez's 
"River's Edge." "I think it would have helped (me) enormously if there'd been 
something like it when I was starting. I think I could still use it." 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers said the program improves writers' skills, whether they make a sale of 
their workshop scripts or not. Even the 60 workshop repertory actors, each of 
whom pays $50 a year to participate in readings, benefit. 
</P>
<P>
"I love doing it; it's a chance to exercise some acting muscles in front of an 
audience," said actor Donald Chase. "I've had some work generated from doing 
the readings too. Sometimes the directors of those projects will decide to use 
me in something they're doing. It's just another way of being active in the 
business." 
</P>
<P>
But the most grateful person involved in the program is Rodgers himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I love this job, I love what I'm doing," he said. "If I didn't have this job, 
I would be going nuts." 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers still writes scripts occasionally, and said he has considered writing 
something autobiographical. It's a pretty good story: Illiterate 18-year-old 
sharecropper educates himself, earns college degrees in anthropology and social 
work, becomes a Woodrow Wilson Fellow, studies theater arts at USC, becomes a 
theater director and TV writer, then the den father to wayward Hollywood 
writers. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he has moved his entire family to Los Angeles and helped them 
get started. Six of his brothers and sisters, he said, have graduated from 
college, and the family gets together three or four times a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never been depressed in my life," Rodgers said. "I've hurt, but I've 
never been depressed. I think I'm going to have $1 million in my own way, and 
I'm going to be happy all the way there."

<P>
Events to look forward to in the new year range from a visit by Leningrad's 
fabled Kirov Ballet and the Philadelphia Orchestra under Riccardo Muti (both at 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center) to an enticing new series at UC 
Irvine featuring contemporary composers and the perennially youthful 
94-year-old music author Nicolas Slonimsky. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the most promising picks for 1989: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Monday, UCI launches a monthlong series entitled "Contemporary 
Composers/Musicians" with San Francisco composer Paul Dresher, who will give 
the first of what are billed as "performances/demonstrations/discussions" at 
7:30 p.m. in the Fine Arts Gallery. Dresher creates experimental operas and 
chamber works utilizing electric and acoustical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Others on the free series, all at the Fine Arts Gallery, will include 
internationally known author and raconteur Slonimsky (Jan. 19), and composers 
Daniel Lentz (Jan. 25) and John King (Jan. 31), both from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Among a slew of orchestral events the Orange County Philharmonic Society is 
sponsoring at the Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, several stand out: 
conductor Mstislav Rostropovich and the National Symphony on Jan. 30; Michael 
Tilson Thomas and the London Symphony on March 13; Colin Davis and the Bavarian 
Radio Symphony, March 15; Zubin Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic, March 18; 
Muti and the Philadelphia Orchestra on May 16 and 18. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Opera buffs can look forward to productions mounted by professional 
companies in 1989, and these follow almost back to back at the Performing Arts 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
New York City Opera will present Verdi's "Rigoletto" on Jan. 17 and 19 and 
Mozart's "Die Zauberflote" on Jan. 18 and 20. 
</P>
<P>
Opera Pacific presents Bellini's "Norma" on Feb. 11 to 24 and Rossini's "Il 
Barbiere di Siviglia" on Feb. 17 to 25. 
</P>
<P>
Both companies also fill out their "seasons" with operetta or musical comedy: 
City Opera with Lehar's "Merry Widow" on Jan. 21 and 22; Opera Pacific with "My 
Fair Lady," June 23 to July 2. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On the lecture circuit, UCI professor Bernard Gilmore will discuss 
"Originality and Other Sins," exploring the notion of "originality" as a 
criterion for artistic judgment on Jan. 12, the first of two free, 
UCI-sponsored faculty lectures in the Stewart Room of the Bren Events Center. 
</P>
<P>
Gilmore is an associate professor in composition, conducting and music theory, 
who last year was acting dean of the School of Fine Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The second of the noon-time lectures will be on Jan. 26 when Joseph Huszti will 
offer "Seeing With Your Ears and Hearing With Your Eyes: Communication Through 
Artistic Performance." Chairman of UCI's music department and head of vocal 
performance, Huszti will discuss concepts such as "style" and "intensity" in 
vocal performance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ballet offerings include the Joffrey Ballet's reconstruction of Nijinsky's 
"Le Sacre du Printemps," plus a new production of Loring's "Billy the Kid," 
among other works, April 18 to 23 at the Center. No word yet, however, if the 
Joffrey's recent reconstruction of Balanchine's "Cotillon" will be on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The famed Kirov Ballet will come to the Center Aug. 18 to 27, with repertory 
including "The Sleeping Beauty," a recent reconstruction of "Le Corsair," and 
mixed bills of works by Roland Petit, Maurice Bejart and Oleg Vinogradov, 
director of the Kirov. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Ballet will appear at UCI on Feb. 17 and 18 as part of the Cocteau 
Festival sponsored by the Severin Wunderman Foundation, the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center and the Center Dance Alliance. Works will include a 
reconstruction of Nijinska's "Le Train Bleu" and other ballets with scenarios 
and designs by Jean Cocteau for the Ballets Russes. 
</P>
<P>
On the lighter side, the drag Ballet Trocadero will once again spoof ballet, 
modern and post-modern dance on Feb 10 at UCI's Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The chamber music lineup features harpsichordist Igor Kipnis, who will play 
music by Bach, Rameau and others on Feb. 5 at Sunny Hills High School in 
Fullerton as part of the Fullerton Friends of Music 30th season. As usual, the 
Friends' concert is free. 
</P>
<P>
The Mendelssohn String Quartet and Musicians from Marlboro will appear on the 
Laguna Beach Chamber Music Society series, on March 22 and May 2, respectively, 
at Laguna Beach High School. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Pacific Symphony's coming year includes the final performances by 
exiting founder-conductor Keith Clark. For his penultimate concerts as music 
director, Clark will conduct the orchestra and the Pacific Chorale in Verdi's 
Requiem at the Center on April 26 and 27. Soloists will include soprano Aprile 
Millo and mezzo-soprano Dolora Zajic.The final offerings in Clark's 11-year 
reign will come May 10 and 11 with cellist Lynn Harrell joining a program of 
Joan Tower's Cello Concerto, the Beethoven Ninth and Tchaikovsky's Variations 
on a Rococo Theme. 
</P>
<P>
The parade of Pacific Symphony guest conductors -- all being looked at for the 
musical director's job -- continues (from last year) with Chattanooga Symphony 
music director Vahktang Jordania on March 1 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
Next season's guests will include Monte Carlo Philharmonic music director 
Lawrence Foster, Oct. 10 and 11; the Pacific's principal guest conductor and 
music adviser Kazimierz Kord, Nov. 1 and 2; BBC Scottish Symphony principal 
conductor Christopher Seaman, Nov. 21 and 22, and Milwaukee Symphony music 
director Zdenek Macal, Dec. 20 and 21. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The local chorales will offer still more Requiems in 1989. John Alexander 
will conduct the Pacific Chorale in Berlioz's Requiem at the Center on March 
19. William Hall will lead the Master Chorale of Orange County in Benjamin 
Britten's "War Requiem" on May 21 at the Center. 
</P>
<P>
Other choral events include the Sistine Chapel Choir at the Center on Feb. 5 
(the concert is sponsored by the Orange County Philharmonic Society), and a 
partially staged and costumed performance of Mendelssohn's "Elijah" April 9 at 
St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Newport Beach.

REAGAN AWAKENED AT 2:53 A.M., HOUR AFTER DOWNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Reagan was awakened about an hour after today's downing of two Libyan 
jet fighters by U.S. Navy planes over the Mediterranean Sea, in contrast to a 
similar incident in 1981 when he was not told for more than six hours. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said Reagan, vacationing at his new 
Bel-Air home, was informed of the incident by National Security Adviser Colin 
L. Powell at 2:53 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Popadiuk said Powell telephoned the President from Washington after conferring 
with White House Chief of Staff Kenneth N. Duberstein. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had no information on Reagan's reaction. 
</P>
<P>
In the earlier incident in August, 1981, seven months after Reagan took office, 
his aides were sharply criticized for allowing him to sleep after they knew of 
the downing of two Libyan planes. 
</P>
<P>
In that instance, Reagan was also in Los Angeles, staying in a $750-a-day suite 
at the Century Plaza Hotel, when then-presidential counselor Edwin Meese III 
informed him.

MAN CONVICTED OF CROSS BURNING

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former tattoo artist was convicted in Santa Ana federal court today of 
burning a cross outside a black family's Westminster home last summer. Gary A. 
Skillman, 24, of Westminster faces up to 21 years in prison and $600,000 in 
fines when he is sentenced March 3. 
</P>
<P>
Skillman was convicted on all criminal charges against him, including 
conspiring to violate another person's civil rights, using force and threat of 
force to intimidate the family because of their race and using fire in the 
commission of a felony. He had maintained that he was simply a bystander to the 
racially motivated crime July 28 that occurred outside Alvin and Lillie 
Heisser's home at 6122 Shawnee Road. 
</P>
<P>
Skillman's lawyer acknowledged that his client was present when the cross was 
built and set afire in the predawn hours of July 28, but claimed that a friend 
of Skillman's was responsible. Prosecutors and Assistant Public Defender Dean 
Steward said they cannot locate the friend.

'89'S 1ST BIG STORM TURNS NORTHEAST INTO AN ICEBOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Howling winds and plummeting temperatures -- a backhanded swipe from the first 
major storm of 1989 -- turned the Northeast into a giant icebox today from 
Caribou, Me., to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Winds gusted to 110 m.p.h. on top of New Hampshire's Mt. Washington this 
morning and combined with temperatures of 17 degrees below zero to produce a 
wind chill of minus 85 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"That's cold enough to make you put your earmuffs on," Mt. Washington 
Observatory spokesman Peter Crane said. He said winds at the summit averaged 89 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
An ice climber who got lost Tuesday on the 6,288-foot mountain, the highest in 
the Northeast, was rescued today, though the cold did some damage to his feet. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of homeless people crowded into New York's shelters as temperatures on 
city streets hovered in the upper teens and winds gusted to 35 m.p.h., 
producing a wind chill of 20 below. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said it would get worse as the day wore on -- with winds 
strengthening to 50 m.p.h. and temperatures falling toward single digits. 
</P>
<P>
In Maine, brisk winds dropped the wind chill to between 45 and 55 degrees below 
zero this afternoon at Caribou, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said the wind and cold were part of the first major storm of 1989, 
which dumped up to 8 inches of snow on parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania by this 
morning, but skipped across the East Coast without delivering on its promise of 
heavy snows in large population centers. 
</P>
<P>
Weather service spokesman Lyle Alexander said that storm was well off in the 
Atlantic early today, but he said it intensified once it hit the water and 
pulled arctic air and strong winds into the East from Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The storm deposited 8 inches of snow by this morning on the Cleveland suburbs 
of Bedford and Garfield Heights, Ohio, and in the mountains of central 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
But forecasts of up to 6 inches of snow from New York to Washington, D.C., 
never materialized. Suburbs of the nation's capital received 2 inches of snow 
and New York was left without a trace. 
</P>
<P>
At Mt. Washington, N.H., Jim Church of Pleasantville, N.Y., was found shortly 
after 10 a.m. today by rescue crews as he began his descent from the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
"He's essentially OK, but he does have some cold injury to his feet," Mike 
Torrey of the Appalachian Mountain Club said. "The fact that he survived at all 
is to his credit." 
</P>
<P>
Church hiked up Mt. Washington on Monday with Mark Fedow, 34, of New York City. 
They decided to leave the summit after a "whiteout" -- an intense blizzard -- 
obscured visibility. 
</P>
<P>
The two spent Monday night below the summit and began to hike down Tuesday but 
became separated, Torrey said. Fedow made his way to the base to find help, but 
Church became lost. 
</P>
<P>
"The conditions on the summit are brutal," said Maj. Henry Mock of the state 
Fish and Game Department. "But he's in good condition."

Borden Inc., the diversified maker of Elmer's Glue, today announced an unusual 
takeover defense under which its 25 top executives will resign if any one of 
them is fired after a buyout of the company at less than fair value. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual plan, which could spread to other companies, goes into effect only 
if a takeover group fails to pay shareholders the "fair value" for their 
shares, including any potential profits from a breakup or restructuring. Borden 
chief executive R. J. Ventres said that without the cooperation of top 
managers, any takeover artist would have a hard time restructuring or selling 
off parts of the company.

BRANIFF WILL BUY 50 OF EUROPE'S AIRBUSES; 
</P>
<P>
UP TO $3.5-BILLION SALE INCLUDES OPTIONS FOR ANOTHER 50; FLEET'S SIZE COULD

Braniff Inc. today announced a bold move to climb into the airline big leagues, 
saying that it will acquire 50 of Europe's Airbus Industrie A320 planes and 
that it has options to get another 50 in a deal valued at up to $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The deal represents one of the largest single orders for jets produced by 
Airbus, the European aircraft consortium that has emerged as a major competitor 
against the U.S. giants of the industry, Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. 
</P>
<P>
It also could nearly triple the fleet size of Braniff, a regional carrier with 
53 jets that has endured three changes of ownership, a Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization, a major recapitalization and the transfer of its major 
operations to Kansas City from Dallas in the last six years. The airline has 
vowed to become a more competitive force in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's announcement, I think, takes us a giant step forward toward making 
that goal a reality," William McGee, Braniff's chairman, told a news conference 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Engines for the planes, which are included in the price, will be supplied by 
IAE International Aero Engines, a consortium of U.S., British, West German, 
Japanese and Italian engine makers that is based in East Hartford, Conn. The 
U.S. partner is Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft of East Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
The deal will be worth the $3.5 billion if Braniff exercises its options to 
acquire all 100 planes. Airbus will sell the first 42 planes to a financing 
group, which will in turn lease them to Braniff. Airbus will have to make its 
own financing arrangements for the other eight in the first group of 50. 
</P>
<P>
The members of the financing group are GPA Group of Shannon, Ireland, an 
aircraft leasing company; Airbus, and the engine supplier, IAE. 
</P>
<P>
McGee confirmed reports that the deal includes 16 planes originally intended 
for Pan Am World Airways, which recently decided to scrap an order of A320s in 
exchange for a payment of $115 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Airbus A320 is a 150-seat, highly efficient aircraft used widely to replace 
aging jets. It was unclear how Braniff's acquisition of these planes would 
affect previously disclosed plans to acquire 23 Boeing 737s from AMR Corp., 
parent of American Airlines.

Two lawmakers proposed legislation today to make permanent the ban on smoking 
on airline flights of two hours or less. 
</P>
<P>
The law will expire in 1990 unless Congress votes to extend it or make the ban 
permanent, as Reps. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and Bill Young (R-Fla.) have 
proposed. They were the original sponsors of the measure first passed in 1987. 
"The American flying public not only has accepted this smoking ban, they 
welcomed it," the two said in a statement. "Experience shows the law has worked 
extraordinarily well."

U.S. ENGINEERS BLAME SHODDY HIGH-RISES FOR ARMENIA'S QUAKE TOLL

<P>
Engineers back from the Armenian earthquake zone today blamed the poor quality 
of newly constructed high-rise apartment buildings for the tremendous loss of 
life in the Soviet disaster area. 
</P>
<P>
Entire blocks of the buildings, most about nine stories tall, were leveled by 
the 6.7 quake. The engineers said widespread use of concrete columns and beams, 
as well as poor workmanship, led to the massive death and destruction Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
"If that type of construction were found on a private job, or even a government 
job, in the United States, the inspector would make the contractor take it down 
and do it over," Loring Wyllie, a structural engineer and chairman of the board 
of H. J. Degenkolb Associates of San Francisco, told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Wyllie was one of 18 American engineers and seismologists assembled by the 
National Academy of Sciences and the U.S. Geological Survey who traveled to 
Leninakan, Spitak and other cities in Armenia to help Soviet authorities. 
</P>
<P>
He told of the inadequate finishing of critical joints in the fallen buildings, 
poorly laid concrete and creative but crude attempts by builders to fix design 
flaws. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a disaster of new buildings," said Fred Krimgold, an associate dean 
at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Krimgold said most of the high-rises were weakened by the quake's initial jolt 
and flattened by a shock about three minutes later. Many of the victims, 
alarmed by the first jolt, were found in stairwells, Krimgold said. 
</P>
<P>
After studying earthquakes in Mexico City and other places, Krimgold said, "We 
thought we had written the book on search and rescue. What we learned in 
Armenia is that we had only written Chapter 1." 
</P>
<P>
He said concrete floors in the collapsed buildings, most of which used concrete 
support columns and beams, fell like pancakes -- leaving no sanctuary for 
people caught in their path. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the buildings in Leninakan came straight down in compact levels of 
rubble," Krimgold said. "Usually there are voids." 
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, many older buildings of only one or two stories were left 
standing by the quake, and Wyllie said high-rises that used a combination of 
concrete floors and inner walls for support suffered less damage.

The United States and Laos have agreed to a year-round effort of research and 
joint excavations to resolve the fate of nearly 550 Americans still officially 
listed as missing in action in Laos, the two governments announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The plan represents the highest level of cooperation established between 
Washington and any of the communist nations of Indochina since war ended in the 
region in 1975. It also includes a pledge by Laos to cooperate with the United 
States in cracking down on opium produced in Laos and a U.S. promise to provide 
food to drought-stricken Laos.

STOCKS RISE SHARPLY BUT DEMAND IS LOW AS TRADERS AWAIT REPORT

<P>
The stock market rallied sharply today, rebounding from the decline it suffered 
in the first session of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 23.93 on Tuesday, climbed 33.04 
points to 2,177.68. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose in foreign exchange trading, reversing its decline Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said traders bid the dollar up amid the uncertainty raised by news 
that U.S. planes shot down two Libyan fighter jets over the Mediterranean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
But demand for stocks was limited, brokers said, by caution in advance of 
Friday's report from the government on the employment situation for December. 
</P>
<P>
If the data show strong growth in payroll employment, many Wall Street analysts 
believe the Federal Reserve would be more likely to tighten credit further in 
its campaign to keep inflation from flaring up again. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 3 to 1 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 1,182 up, 328 down and 445 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 149.70 million shares, against 128.50 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 2.08 to 157.06. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rose slightly this morning, supported by strength in the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's 30-year bond rose about 1/8 point or $1.25 per $1,000 in face 
amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, eased to 
9.07% from 9.08% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Credit market strategists attributed the reaction to a rising dollar. The 
dollar historically has been a safe-haven currency during times of political 
tension. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
were largely unchanged, intermediate maturities rose about 3/32 of a point and 
long-term issues were up about 1/8 point, the Telerate Inc. financial 
information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
Prices strengthened slightly in the corporate market. Moody's investment grade 
corporate bond index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with 
maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.15 to 293.79. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.49% as the discount fell 2 basis 
points to 8.21%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.85% as the discount rose 1 
basis point to 8.37%. Yields on one-year bills were unchanged at 9.08% as the 
discount stayed at 8.41%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 9.37%, down from 9.62% late Tuesday.

BANKS ROBBED IN TUSTIN, IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Orange County banks were robbed about 17 minutes apart late this morning, 
and police said the same man may have committed both robberies. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin police said a man entered the California Federal Savings Bank at 14232 
Redhill Ave. at 11:17 a.m. and indicated to a teller that he had a bomb in his 
briefcase. He then forced two bank employees into a vault, returned to their 
teller stations and took an undetermined amount of cash. Police said the other 
bank tellers did not notice that a robbery was in progress. The robber fled. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was described as a light-complexioned Latino, 23 to 27 years old, 5 
feet, 8 inches tall and heavily built. He was wearing a full-length tan trench 
coat, a Panama hat, black trousers and what appeared to be prescription 
glasses. 
</P>
<P>
At about 11 a.m. in Irvine, an unarmed man demanded money from a teller at a 
Security Pacific National Bank branch at Culver Drive and Walnut Avenue, Irvine 
police said. The man escaped with an undetermined amount of money.

COUNTY MAN GUILTY OF CROSS BURNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former tattoo artist was convicted in Santa Ana federal court today of 
burning a cross outside a black family's Westminster home last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Gary A. Skillman, 24, of Westminster faces 1 to 21 years in prison and $600,000 
in fines when he is sentenced March 3. 
</P>
<P>
Skillman was convicted on all criminal charges against him, including 
conspiring to violate another person's civil rights, using force and threat of 
force to intimidate the family because of race and using fire in the commission 
of a felony. He had maintained that he was only a bystander to the racially 
motivated crime outside Alvin and Lillie Heisser's home at 6122 Shawnee Road. 
</P>
<P>
Skillman's lawyer had acknowledged that his client was present when the cross 
was built and set afire before dawn on July 28 but said a friend of Skillman's 
was responsible. Prosecutors and assistant public defender Dean Steward said 
they cannot find the friend.

MAN SEIZED AFTER 4-HOUR CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Palm Desert man led several patrol cars and a helicopter on a four-hour chase 
Tuesday night that began in Malibu, wound through Orange County and ended when 
he ran out of gasoline in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Bret T. Barish, 30, was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving, driving without 
a license and evading a police officer. He was booked into jail in San Diego 
County but later released, a Sheriff's Department spokesman there said. 
</P>
<P>
The chase began when a California Highway Patrol officer stopped Barish's 
Volkswagen on Malibu Canyon Road at 6:45 p.m. As the officer approached the 
car, the Volkswagen took off, CHP Officer Cliff Williams said.

West German unemployment figures for 1988 show that despite the highest 
economic growth this decade, West Germany's jobless rate rose and economists 
are predicting worse to come. 
</P>
<P>
Data released by the Federal Labor Office today revealed that an average of 
2.24 million people were without work throughout last year -- a jobless rate of 
8.7%, compared with 8.5% in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Petra Ott, Frankfurt-based economist for Citibank AG, saw the unemployment rate 
rising again this year in the world's third-biggest economy. "A rate of over 9% 
for 1989 doesn't seem unrealistic," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The new Labor Office statistics showed the jobless rate declining in December 
to 8.5% from 9.2% in the same month of 1987. But it attributed the decrease to 
unusually mild weather last month. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany's job market faces the special problem of having to employ 
thousands of Eastern Bloc refugees invited by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 
government into the country, said Peter Pietsch, an economist at Commerzbank AG 
in Frankfurt.

Grand Metropolitan PLC has completed its tender offer to acquire Pillsbury Co.

About 98.7% of the 85.8 million outstanding Pillsbury shares had been accepted

Met said.

Grand Met, a distilling and retailing giant, acquired the Minneapolis-based

BORDEN MANAGERS TO QUIT IF BUYOUT PRICE ISN'T MET

Borden Inc. announced a plan today to deter a takeover of the food and chemical 
company at less than what it considers a fair price by ensuring that Borden's 
top 25 managers will quit if that price isn't met. 
</P>
<P>
"We think any potential raider would think twice about losing that group at 
once," said Romeo J. Ventres, Borden's chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that banks and investment houses would be reluctant to loan 
money or raise funds for such a raider. 
</P>
<P>
Ventres said that the New York-based company knows of no takeover attempt and 
that Borden already has a "stockholder rights" plan designed to fend off an 
unwanted suitor. 
</P>
<P>
Ventres said the 25 managers agreed to the plan because they have invested an 
average of 21 years in the company each and want it to remain independent. 
Borden estimates its 1988 sales at $7.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The company is a leader in the dairy, snack food, pasta, wall covering, forest 
product resins and packaging-films fields.

EUROPE'S FOOD SURPLUS DWINDLING

<P>
The European Community's surplus food stockpiles are dwindling fast, according 
to figures published today by the EC's executive commission. 
</P>
<P>
Cereals, butter and milk stocks have fallen particularly sharply both in volume 
and value over the last year, an EC spokesman told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Tough farm reforms helped cut the total value of surplus stocks by almost half 
in the year through September to a provisional 4.66 billion European Currency 
Units, or $5.4 billion, he said. A year earlier they totaled 10.57 billion 
ECUs, or $12.26 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"This positive development is the direct result of Common Agricultural Policy 
reform," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Policies agreed to at a landmark summit last February were intended partly to 
cut down the amount of unwanted output the EC bought from its 10 million 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
The butter supplies fell from more than a million tons to just 221,000 tons 
over the year to Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
At its peak in November, 1986, the butter stock totaled 1.4 million tons. The 
EC found many ways of disposing of it, such as giving it to the needy at 
Christmas, feeding it to veal calves and selling it to lipstick manufacturers.

Tim Murphy, who turned around the football program at the University of Maine, 
was named today as the head football coach at the University of Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm foolish enough to believe that I can influence this program. We have no 
place to go but up," said Murphy, 32. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, described as a disciplinarian and a motivator by new Cincinnati 
athletic director Rick Taylor, had worked as an assistant coach for three years 
under Taylor at Boston University. Murphy said he is concerned about 
Cincinnati's NCAA probation and said he will work to improve the program's 
image nationally. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, who has been the head football coach at Maine the last two seasons, was 
one of two finalists for the job vacated by Dave Currey. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati has had six straight losing seasons in football and has been put on 
NCAA probation for violations in its football and men's basketball programs. 
Currey resigned after his fifth losing season and after the NCAA sanctions were 
announced.

Dallas Coach Tom Landry, back from a Hill Country vacation, said today the 
Cowboys won't decide until February whether they will make UCLA's Troy Aikman 
the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman led the Bruins to a 17-3 victory on Monday over the Arkansas Razorbacks 
and was named the most valuable offensive player of the 53rd annual Cotton 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Landry watched on television while celebrating the New Year with his family. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Troy did a good job of taking what Arkansas gave him," Landry said. 
"They took away the deep pass, so he threw the short passes well. He did a good 
job of directing the team. UCLA had a good running game and that helped." 
</P>
<P>
Landry wouldn't say Aikman was a Cowboy yet, however. 
</P>
<P>
"People say it would be a mistake to take him now without exploring all the 
possibilities of having a first choice," Landry said. "Troy is a definite 
prospect, but we ought to look overall into what is best for the team." 
</P>
<P>
Landry said, "We've got plenty of time to make the pick. We have to finish off 
some things from last season this month. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say we should be ready to make a decision around then. Once we do make our 
choice and if it is Troy, then we'd like to sign him as soon as we could to get 
him into quarterback school."

Swedish Davis Cup captain Hans Olsson announced today he was quitting after 
Sweden, boasting two of the world's top-ranked players, lost to West Germany in 
the cup final last month. 
</P>
<P>
Olsson, the nonplaying captain who led Sweden to three Davis Cup titles since 
1984, was replaced by John-Anders (Jonte) Sjogren. 
</P>
<P>
Olsson cited time pressures and his unwillingness to travel with the team as 
his reason for stepping down. 
</P>
<P>
Sjogren coaches Mats Wilander, winner of last year's Australian, French and 
U.S. Opens. 
</P>
<P>
Olsson came under fierce criticism after the Davis Cup team, led by Wilander 
and 1988 Wimbledon winner Stefan Edberg, lost 4-1 on indoor clay at home in 
Goteborg to a powerful German squad headed by Boris Becker.
