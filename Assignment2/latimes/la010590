ESCAPEE SOUGHT IN SCORES OF HOME BREAK-INS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

A man who escaped from state prison seven years ago is the prime suspect in 
more than 100 daylight residential burglaries in North County last year, but 
police now worry that the thief may have once again eluded authorities by 
disappearing into Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed the "Bernardo Bandit," 28-year-old Sergio Gomez has eluded San Diego 
police and county sheriff's deputies while allegedly breaking into homes in 
North County and taking tens of thousands of dollars worth of jewelry, precious 
coins and expensive silver. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the burglaries, which have occurred in the Rancho Bernardo and Rancho 
Penasquitos areas, occurred between 7 a.m. and noon, with the thief prying open 
a rear door or window and taking only small items -- such as coins, jewelry and 
personal effects -- that are easily concealable. 
</P>
<P>
"The nature and the quantities of the crimes are such that he's a major player 
up here for us," said Lt. Mike Gillespie of the Police Department's 
Northeastern Division. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Detective Sgt. Mike Wittmer, based in Vista, said: "He frequents the 
North County area quite a bit and has a lot of ties up here. And he's 
established over the years that repentance is not part of his character. He 
doesn't learn from his mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, who uses an alias of Sergio Sanchez, was serving a three-year sentence 
on a San Diego burglary conviction, officials said, when he vanished in 
December, 1982, from the Sierra Conservation Center, a medium-security state 
prison in the Mother Lode town of Jamestown. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Ken Casler, a state prison spokesman, said that Gomez walked away from a 
work project at a nearby fairgrounds and "we haven't seen or heard from him 
since." 
</P>
<P>
Last January, a series of residential burglaries in North San Diego County 
began, with 98 occurring in the city's northern reaches and about half a dozen 
more in the San Marcos and rural Escondido areas. 
</P>
<P>
In more than a dozen of the cases, police said, Gomez's fingerprints were 
found. A large amount of the loot, including antique rings, statues and silver 
that was believed stolen in the burglaries, has turned up at local pawn shops. 
Gomez is named in six arrest warrants, including one issued by the FBI for 
stealing money from a bank. 
</P>
<P>
But the burglaries abruptly stopped in early November, and police now wonder if 
Gomez, who is described as having close relatives and friends living both in 
North County and in Mexico, may have slipped across the border. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego officers and sheriff's deputies have been given detailed descriptions 
of Gomez, and one detective in the Police Department's fugitive apprehension 
detail even keeps a case file on Gomez should he find the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"We've checked every place we know he's running," Wittmer said. "We checked 
prior addresses and stuff like that and put the information out to our patrol 
units. But even then, nothing." 
</P>
<P>
In another attempt to locate him, Officer Kelly Shay has put together a Crime 
Stoppers film re-enactment to be aired as public service announcements over the 
next two weeks on local television stations, and a reward of up to $1,000 has 
been posted for information leading to his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez is described as Hispanic, 6 feet tall, 170 pounds, with brown hair, brown 
eyes, long hair and a beard. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information is asked to call police at 235-TIPS.

URBAN LEAGUE ASKS CAWTHORNE FOR BACK FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
CIVIC AFFAIRS: THE GROUP'S CHARISMATIC PRESIDENT ABRUPTLY QUIT LAST JUNE, AND 
HIS LAWYER SAYS THE URBAN LEAGUE IS NOW SEEKING MONEY CAWTHORNE DOESN'T BELIEVE 
IS OWED. 
</P>

<P>
The San Diego Urban League is seeking to recover money from former President 
Herb Cawthorne, who suddenly resigned amid unexplained circumstances in June. 
The group may take legal action against him. 
</P>
<P>
The organization has demanded about $13,000 from Cawthorne, now an executive 
for the Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce, according to one source familiar 
with Urban League affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll confirm that they've made a demand," said Robert Baxley, Cawthorne's 
attorney. "They've asked for money, and we don't believe it's owed." 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear when the Urban League demanded the money or how the request is 
connected to the still-unexplained circumstances of Cawthorne's resignation 
from the Urban League on June 7. Baxley refused further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Urban League attorney Beatrice Kemp and the organization's chairwoman, Deborah 
Brady-Davis, refused to confirm or deny any demand for a payment from 
Cawthorne, as did numerous other board members contacted this week. Cawthorne, 
now vice president of the Chamber's local government division, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
But one source said the Urban League will soon decide whether it is financially 
worthwhile to file a lawsuit against Cawthorne and whether legal action is the 
right move for the reputation of an organization that seven years ago endured 
charges of financial improprieties by another president, Clarence Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton, who died of a heart attack in 1986, resigned his post in 1982 after 
being ordered to rehire the former controller who claimed Pendleton had 
misspent $94,000 of a federal grant. 
</P>
<P>
The outspoken, charismatic Cawthorne, perhaps the city's most visible black 
leader in nearly two years as head of the Urban League chapter, organized 
well-publicized marches of mourning for the victims of drive-by shootings and, 
just a week before his resignation, led a march through downtown with Mayor 
Maureen O'Connor and Police Chief Bob Burgreen to demand more state assistance 
in the city's anti-crime effort. 
</P>
<P>
He was a leader of the bitter, unsuccessful effort to enact a City 
Council-sponsored growth limitation measure in 1988, and this year is 
co-chairman of a group sponsoring another ballot initiative on growth written 
primarily by the building industry. 
</P>
<P>
Cawthorne inherited a financially unstable organization when he took over in 
August, 1987, and was credited with significantly boosting fund raising as well 
as forging better ties to the downtown business establishment. 
</P>
<P>
But he mysteriously resigned at a June 7 board meeting, reportedly under 
pressure after an audit questioned his use of Urban League funds. Neither 
Cawthorne nor the Urban League has ever publicly explained the reason for the 
resignation.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: BIKE THIEF DECIDES BANISHMENT TO DESERT BEATS PRISON JUNGLE

Law and order in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
* Steal a bike, go to Yemen. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone talks about finding alternatives to putting more prisoners in San 
Diego's crowded jails. But nobody does anything about it. 
</P>
<P>
At least not until Thursday, when Municipal Judge Frank Brown was faced with 
sentencing a 27-year-old man for misdemeanor grand theft stemming from a tussle 
in Kearny Mesa over a 10-speed. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant's relatives begged Brown to let them take him back to their 
ancestral home. 
</P>
<P>
So Brown gave Mohamad Alkazan a choice: a year in County Jail or a year in 
Yemen. It didn't take Alkazan long to decide. 
</P>
<P>
He leaves for his native land today. If he's spotted in San Diego or anywhere 
else in the United States in the next year, he goes directly to jail, with no 
traveling privileges. 
</P>
<P>
* The San Diego Chess Club is being decimated by the theft and burglary of 
members' cars during its Wednesday night meetings in the senior citizens' 
center on the 6th Avenue side of Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Membership has dropped from 300 to 75. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing driving people away is the danger to their cars," President 
Jack Miller said. "One club member had his car broken into three times in a 
year. I don't blame him for not coming back." 
</P>
<P>
The park is a magnet for car crime, averaging a theft and burglary every day of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
Miller says one officer advised members to leave their cars unlocked so thieves 
don't have to break a window to discover there's nothing worth stealing inside. 
</P>
<P>
However, Steve Tiplitsky, the Police Department's community relations officer 
for Balboa Park, says that is not an officially sanctioned idea. He says 
leaving your car unlocked could encourage its use as a sleeping spot by 
transients -- another problem plaguing the park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Of Fish, Furniture and Fund Raising 
</P>
<P>
One thing after another. 
</P>
<P>
* Pete Wilson, who was never close to President Reagan, is similarly on the 
outs with President Bush, according to Washington columnists Roland Evans and 
Bob Novak. 
</P>
<P>
Evans and Novak quote a "Republican insider" as saying, "Pete is a cold fish, 
and that doesn't appeal to the President." 
</P>
<P>
* New Council Members Linda Bernhardt and John Hartley have ordered extensive 
remodeling jobs for their 10th-floor offices at City Hall. At public expense, 
naturally. 
</P>
<P>
* Local magicians will do tricks Saturday at the San Diego Blood Bank on Upas 
Street and the North County Donor Center in Escondido as part of the theme 
"Perform a Miracle, Be a Blood Donor." 
</P>
<P>
Among them will be Loch David Crane, magician and political candidate. He ran 
for mayor a few years back; after that, he disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
* That satellite TV dish in the movie "She-Devil," being used by Meryl Streep's 
son to watch pro wrestling, was provided by VideoCipher Corp. of Sorrento 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
VideoCipher provides scrambling technology for cable TV, but the chance to go 
Hollywood was irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Seats of Power 
</P>
<P>
As men who have served close to the seats of power, their own seats deserve 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
So it was decided that the nine presidential press secretaries from six 
administrations who are participating in today's symposium at UC San Diego on 
"The Presidency, the Press and the People" deserved a decent place to sit. 
Organizers began hunting for fancy chairs. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a deal was struck with the 4th District Court of Appeal for the loan 
of red leather chairs used by the justices. All are reportedly quite comfy on 
the human backside. 
</P>
<P>
You can admire the chairs at 9 tonight on KPBS-TV (Channel 15) when the 
symposium is broadcast on tape-delay. 
</P>
<P>
But don't bother calling the station to ask whether you can talk to the chair 
maker about getting some for your den. The chairs were made by inmates at San 
Quentin.

WEEKEND WEATHER EXPECTED TO BE COMFORTABLY BORING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
No frills, fewer chills. This weekend's weather forecast calls for all-around 
sunshine, mild temperatures and a halt to the recent string of nightly frost 
advisories in local agricultural areas. 
</P>
<P>
Except for an occasional high cloud wafting by, the weather through Sunday 
promises to be gloriously dull. Daytime temperatures will rise slowly and 
nights will gradually become more moderate, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be a very nice weekend with milder temperatures and no sight of rain 
at least into the middle of next week," said National Weather Service 
meteorologist Wilbur Shigehara. "We will see some high clouds filtering through 
from storms in the Pacific Northwest, but no rain." 
</P>
<P>
A frost advisory issued Wednesday night when temperatures dipped below 30 
degrees in such agricultural areas as Bonsall, Escondido and Valley Center will 
be lifted tonight, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been getting some frost, but nothing dangerous," he said. "Most crops 
are fairly hardy and can take temperatures down to about 29 degrees. Growers 
don't have to really start worrying until it gets to about 27 or 28 degrees." 
</P>
<P>
The normal high temperature for this time of year is 65 and the normal low is 
48 degrees, Shigehara said. The high at Lindbergh Field Thursday was 64. 
</P>
<P>
Highs along the beaches will be from 58 to 63 today and 60 to 65 on the 
weekend, Shigehara said. The ocean is 59 degrees, and the surf is at 2 to 4 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal highs for the whole weekend will range from 65 to 70 degrees. Lows will 
range from 40 to 50 tonight and from 42 to 52 Saturday night, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Light breezes along the coast will reach about 16 m.p.h. over the weekend, 
Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Inland highs through Sunday are expected to range from 68 to 75. Overnight lows 
will climb slightly, to between 29 and 39 degrees tonight and to between 35 and 
45 degrees Saturday night, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Highs in the mountains will be from 40 to 46 today and from 40 to 50 on the 
weekend, Shigehara said. Lows of 25 to 33 tonight and 27 to 35 Saturday night 
are forecast. 
</P>
<P>
In the foothills near Poway and San Vicente, winds will gust up to 25 m.p.h. 
today but will diminish Saturday, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Desert highs will be between 65 and 70 today, and up to near 70 on the weekend. 
Lows will be from 30 to 40 tonight and 32 to 42 Saturday night, Shigehara said.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SHEEN, ASNER ARRESTED IN EL SALVADOR PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A hundred demonstrators, including activist-actors Martin Sheen and Ed Asner 
and several Los Angeles clergymen, were arrested again this week for blocking 
access to the downtown Federal Building in protest of U.S. involvement in El 
Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
The action marked the sixth weekly civil disobedience protest at the Federal 
Building by a coalition of religious leaders and peace activists since the 
slaying of six Jesuit priests and two women in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests have been made in the November slayings, which the protesters 
believe are linked to the U.S. government-supported military forces of El 
Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters, cited for trespassing on federal property, linked arms to keep 
employees from entering the building. Before their arrests, a series of 
speeches were delivered by health-care workers and AIDS-care activists against 
U.S. involvement in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Father Don R. Kribs, chaplain at County-USC Medical Center, called on the U.S. 
government to redirect military spending to help improve health-care programs 
here and in El Salvador.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MORATORIUM ON BUILDING SMALL MOTELS EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A moratorium on the construction of small motels has been extended by Inglewood 
City Council members to allow planners to prepare tighter building codes for 
the units. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary measure, first approved Nov. 21, bans construction of motels with 
fewer than 40 units through Nov. 20, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The measure had been scheduled to lapse last Friday but City Council members 
voted unanimously to approve the extension. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Garland Hardeman, who oversees the district with the greatest number 
of small motels, said he sought the ban as a means to discourage drug dealers 
and prostitutes, who frequently use the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives the city more time to take a look at some provisions . . . for a 
permanent ordinance regulating small motels in the city," Hardeman said.

L.A. PARTLY AT FAULT IN 1983 AUTO CRASH, JURY DECIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles has been found partly at fault in a 1983 accident in 
which a speeding car careened out of control on Paseo del Mar in San Pedro, 
severely injuring an artist who was sketching a nearby carnival scene. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court jury Wednesday awarded $2 million to the victim, 
52-year-old Shirley Kay Batt of Rancho Palos Verdes. She suffered severe and 
permanent brain damage when the out-of-control car slammed into her vehicle, 
which was legally parked on the side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the jury ordered the city to pay $750,000 to Batt's husband, 
Richard, an aerospace engineer who has cared for his wife since the crash. Said 
their lawyer, Bruce Broillet: "This has totally devastated his life." 
</P>
<P>
The accident stemmed from an illegal drag race between two San Pedro youths. In 
finding the city only partly at fault, the jury acknowledged that the rest of 
the blame lay with the youths, one of whom was killed when his car rolled over 
and hit Mrs. Batts' station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
In issuing its verdict Wednesday, the jury determined that city officials had 
received repeated complaints about the speeding problem on Paseo del Mar and 
failed to take action to slow traffic along the road, which curves past elegant 
houses and majestic palm trees along San Pedro's coastline. 
</P>
<P>
"What this verdict means is that where the city knows, or has reason to know, 
of dangerous conditions on our roadways, they better do something about it so 
that innocent users of the roadway don't get hurt," Broillet said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Michael Fox, however, maintained that the city cannot be 
responsible for how people drive on its roads and thus was not at fault. He 
said an appeal is likely. 
</P>
<P>
'A Terrible Tragedy' 
</P>
<P>
The two lawyers gave the following account of what Fox described as "a terrible 
tragedy": 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Batt, at the time a 46-year-old art student at California State 
University, Long Beach, was parked on the north side of Paseo del Mar, where 
she was sketching a carnival that had been set up in nearby Angels Gate Park. 
</P>
<P>
Not far away, on the corner of 25th Street and Western Avenue, two youths 
driving Chevrolet Camaros got into an argument about their cars. Before long, 
they were racing one another down the hill. 
</P>
<P>
The cars, driven by a USC freshman and a San Pedro High School student, sped 
down Western Avenue and rounded the curve onto Paseo del Mar, where they 
traveled at speeds of 80 m.p.h. and possibly up to 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
At some point, the high school student's car spun out of control, rolled over 
and slid across the road into Mrs. Batt's car. The driver, Gary Kordich, 17, 
died in the accident. According to the lawyers, the other driver was later 
tried as a juvenile and convicted, but they were unable to confirm the charge 
because of the difficulty in obtaining Juvenile Court records. 
</P>
<P>
According to Broillet and Fox, testimony during the trial showed that residents 
have complained for years about speeding along Paseo del Mar, where the speed 
limit is 35 m.p.h. One Los Angeles police officer who testified called the 
speeding "a constant problem," according to Fox. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, in an interview Thursday, the Los Angeles police officer who is in 
charge of traffic complaints for the area said that he routinely tickets 
speeders along that stretch of roadway. 
</P>
<P>
"Due to the fact that it's a nice wide street right at the cliff's edge, people 
have a tendency to speed," said Officer Phil Dudley. However, Dudley said the 
strip is not known as a drag-racing spot. "People don't get together someplace 
else and say, 'Hey, let's go down to Paseo del Mar and race,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Broillet, along with a traffic engineer who testified as an 
expert witness for the plaintiff, contended that the city could have made 
engineering improvements to the road -- such as replacing the second eastbound 
lane with a median strip and turning lanes -- that would have prevented the 
drag race and the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, city transportation engineers said Thursday that such improvements 
are currently on the drawing boards. But they said their plans are unrelated to 
the court case and, while they would make the road safer, would do little to 
prevent accidents like the one that killed Kordich and injured Mrs. Batt. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't think they would have had any effect on this case," said David 
Royer, a city traffic engineer who also testified in the Batt case. "This 
wasn't a case where he slightly went into the median area. He was totally out 
of control and across the road and slammed into a car that was parked clear on 
the other side of the road. You cannot design any road or urban street for a 
driver to be able to safely drive at 80 miles per hour." 
</P>
<P>
In the city's defense, Fox argued during the trial that Paseo del Mar was safe 
at the time of the November, 1983, accident. He said that as long as a road is 
in good condition and is properly maintained the city should not be held 
accountable for the way people drive on it. 
</P>
<P>
Although he termed the crash "a terrible tragedy," he said the jury's verdict, 
if taken to its logical conclusion, could expose the city to lawsuits every 
time a speeder gets into an accident.

"The city believes that it's not the city's fault, that the city should not be 
held accountable for this kind of conduct, even under the circumstances that 
were shown in this case," he said.

GANG MEMBER CONVICTED IN SLAYING AT MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Crips gang member who opened fire on a member of the rival Bloods in a 
Panorama City mall crowded with Christmas shoppers and killed a teen-age boy by 
mistake was convicted Thursday of first-degree murder and attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
After a day of deliberations, a Van Nuys Superior Court jury found Roger Leon 
White, 23, of Van Nuys guilty in the death of Sergio Alpuche, 16, also of Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Shellie Samuels, the prosecutor, told jurors that White was 
aiming at a member of the rival Bloods gang when he shot Alpuche at the 
Panorama City Mall on Dec. 16, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Alpuche was not a gang member, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Darlene E. Schempp scheduled sentencing for Feb. 
2. White faces a maximum sentence of 27 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
White's alleged accomplice in the shooting, William Stalling, 19, of Pacoima, 
pleaded guilty earlier to a charge of being an accessory to the murder and was 
sentenced to the one year he had already served in jail since his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the pair, members of the Crips gang, confronted Ernest 
Townsend, of the rival Bloods gang, as he walked past the mall with his 
girlfriend and baby. Townsend testified at the preliminary hearing for White 
and Stalling that the two men ordered him to put down his baby. 
</P>
<P>
He said he ran inside the mall and handed the baby to a friend before the 
shooting began. 
</P>
<P>
White's attorney, James D. Gregory, told jurors that there was no evidence that 
White shot Alpuche. 
</P>
<P>
He argued that a key witness changed her testimony and that several witnesses 
gave conflicting testimony in identifying White.

DISTRICT SEEKS NEW DEADLINE ON LAND FOR SCHOOLS AT PORTER RANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles school board voted unanimously Thursday to ask the City Council 
to ease conditions under which the district can buy land for schools from 
developers of the proposed $2-billion Porter Ranch project. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution asks that developers be required to reserve 22 acres of land, 
which the district could buy for schools, until at least half of the 3,395 
homes and townhouses proposed in the Chatsworth development are built and 
occupied. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,300-acre development -- the largest single project in Los Angeles history 
-- must be approved by the City Council, which is expected to discuss the 
matter later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Under conditions approved by the council's Planning and Land Use Committee last 
month, project developer Nathan Shapell must hold the land only until the end 
of the year 2000. After that, it can be used for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
But board member Julie Korenstein, who introduced the motion, said unforeseen 
delays in construction of the homes until past the deadline could make it 
impossible for the district to exercise its option to purchase the land. Under 
the current project conditions, several hundred families -- the exact number to 
be determined by state education officials at the time -- with school-age 
children must move into the new Porter Ranch homes before the district can 
exercise the option to buy the school sites. 
</P>
<P>
Porter Ranch project representative Paul Clarke said there are no plans to 
change the council committee's recommendation. He said it is impossible to 
predict the project's completion date. 
</P>
<P>
Under conditions set by the council committee, the Los Angeles Unified School 
District must also reopen one of two nearby elementary schools that were closed 
in 1982 because of declining enrollment at the time. The board in its 
resolution asked that condition be deleted because the closer of the two 
schools is more than four miles away, too far for youngsters to walk.

SANTA CLARITA BUILDERS ASK FOR PROJECTS TO BE SPARED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A long line of builders, faced with the prospect of seeing their developments 
killed or scaled back, tried to persuade Los Angeles County planners Thursday 
to ease stringent growth restrictions proposed for the Santa Clarita Valley 
over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the city of Santa Clarita, meanwhile, praised the proposal, 
saying it makes good sense to limit development until sufficient roads, schools 
and other services can be built to serve the area. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would revise the valley's general plan, which acts as a broad 
guide for development. The county Regional Planning Commission held the first 
of several hearings on the document Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The new general plan would uphold a county policy, being challenged by 
developers, that allows the valley's population, now about 150,000, to reach 
270,000 by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would allow developers to build 10,100 new houses, condominiums and 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
But sitting in county files are plans to build at least 38,000 dwelling units 
on unincorporated land surrounding the 2-year-old city of Santa Clarita. In 
order to stay under the population ceiling, county planners say the county will 
have to reject plans for close to 28,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
During a 3 1/2-hour hearing, 18 developers asked commissioners to include their 
projects in the final plan or ease restrictions that would scale back some 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
For some developers, the stakes are high. 
</P>
<P>
The Dale Poe Development Corp., for example, wants to build 4,632 units on land 
zoned for 891 units. 
</P>
<P>
The project is located west of the Golden State Freeway and a few miles south 
of Magic Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
A project that size could not be built under the proposed general plan, which 
retains the limit of 891 units. 
</P>
<P>
David Breier, an attorney for Dale Poe, asked commissioners to support the 
project, saying it would benefit the Santa Clarita Valley with new roads, 
school sites and parks. 
</P>
<P>
Other developers also touted their projects, saying they would bring jobs, 
roads and affordable housing to the valley. 
</P>
<P>
One developer, David Doremus, said the commissioners should not restrict growth 
at all. "We have lots and lots of land that should be utilized," he said. 
Large-scale growth is feasible, he said, as long as planners make sure there 
are public services for the surging population. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita officials praised the general plan overall but questioned the 
proposed distribution of the 10,100 units that would be allowed before 2010. 
</P>
<P>
About 75% of those units would be built in unincorporated areas and the 
remainder inside Santa Clarita. Assistant City Manager Ken Pulskamp said the 
ratio should be reversed, with Santa Clarita overseeing the majority of growth 
in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita Mayor Jo Anne Darcy said the pace of growth should be tied to the 
adequacy of public facilities in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
A recent county report estimated the valley will need at least $912 million in 
capital improvements -- from parks to schools to libraries -- to serve the 
region by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
The commission will hear more testimony on the issue Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
The final general plan eventually must be approved by the county Board of 
Supervisors.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRIVER HELD IN WRECK THAT KILLED 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 20-year-old Glendale man was arrested for allegedly causing an accident in 
which a father and daughter were killed and then fleeing, authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Ayala, 20, was arrested Wednesday night, minutes after he allegedly ran a 
stop sign, broadsided another car and ran to his nearby home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Karapet Khajehtorians, 57, and his daughter Janice, who was in her early 20s, 
were killed when their car was hit at Elk Avenue and Everett Street about 11 
p.m., Sgt. Dean Durand said. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala was arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter and felony hit and 
run. His father, Juan Ayala, 53, was also arrested as an accessory for 
providing false information to investigators, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The Khajehtorians were headed south on Everett Street in a 1975 Datsun after 
the father had picked up his daughter from work at a nearby fast-food 
restaurant, when they were hit by a 1977 Camaro, Durand said. 
</P>
<P>
When police arrived shortly after 11 p.m. Wednesday, the driver of the Camaro 
had fled but a check of the registration with the Department of Motor Vehicles 
led investigators to Ayala's residence, Durand said. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Ayala told investigators the car had been stolen earlier, but witnesses 
told police that they saw Jorge Ayala cause the accident and run away, Durand 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Karapet Khajehtorians was dead at the scene and Janice Khajehtorians was 
pronounced dead on arrival at Glendale Adventist hospital. Jorge and Juan Ayala 
were being held at Glendale City Jail.

MOST COMMON TYPE OF BLOOD DANGEROUSLY LOW, BANK SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANETTE AVENT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The supply of O-positive blood is at half the minimum safety level, the San 
Diego Blood Bank reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Two traumatic accidents would be it for us," blood bank spokeswoman Stephani 
Casenza said. 
</P>
<P>
Based on daily demand, the safety level for O-positive, the most common blood 
type, is a minimum of 250 pints, Casenza said. 
</P>
<P>
As an example of how quickly the blood supply can be drained, Casenza cited the 
case of a stagehand who was critically injured when a steel beam fell on him 
after a rock concert in August. 
</P>
<P>
His first operation required 100 pints of blood and blood components. He died, 
but, during his hospitalization, he used more than 200 pints of blood and 
components, Casenza said. 
</P>
<P>
The blood bank supplies San Diego County's 27 non-military hospitals and 
Imperial County, Casenza said, adding, "We need 300 volunteers a day to keep 
the hospitals supplied." 
</P>
<P>
Donations fluctuate daily, but "we have less than half the safety level now for 
O-positive. We are experiencing a severe shortage of all blood types," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The blood bank makes an appeal to bolster supplies two to three times a year, 
"but during the holiday season we have a real tough time keeping the blood 
supplies up," Casenza said. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in November, potential donors become both busier and sick more often. 
At the same time, increased traffic and drinking-related accidents mean 
increased demand for blood, Casenza said. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, about 9% of the population in San Diego has donated all of the 
blood supply, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Donors can give blood at the San Diego Blood Bank's Hillcrest facility at 440 
Upas St. Hours are 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. weekdays and 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
At the North County Donor Center, 1845 E. Valley Parkway in Escondido, hours 
are 11:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. weekdays and 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
At the North Coastal Donor Center, 161 Thunder Drive, Suite 108 in Vista, hours 
are 11:30 a.m. to 7 p.m., Wednesday through Friday and 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Tuesday and Saturday.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SENTENCED IN ARMORED CAR HOLDUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 35-year-old transient was sentenced Thursday to 14 years in prison for taking 
part in a shoot-out with an armored car driver at a crowded Gelson's Market in 
North Hollywood and in two robberies in Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Darlene E. Schempp sentenced Calvin Michael Grant 
on four counts of robbery and one count of assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Grant had pleaded guilty to the charges on Nov. 20 before his trial was set to 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
Grant's co-defendant, Steven Bernard Young, is facing trial on the same 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Kahn, the prosecutor on the case, Grant 
and Young attempted to rob the driver of an armored car as he picked up money 
at the Gelson's Market at 4738 Laurel Canyon Blvd. As customers dove for cover, 
the driver of the armored car, David E. Forney, fired back, wounding Grant in 
the thigh. 
</P>
<P>
No one else was injured, and Grant and Young escaped in a car without getting 
any money, Kahn said. 
</P>
<P>
Grant was arrested four days later in a Brentwood motel after officers found a 
plastic bag containing bloody clothing outside and linked him to the robberies, 
Kahn said. Young was arrested about six months later, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Grant also pleaded guilty to stealing $37,500 from an armored car in an armed 
robbery outside a K mart in Diamond Bar on Dec. 22, 1987, and to stealing 
$5,000 during a robbery of a Coast Savings in Diamond Bar on May 17, 1988, 
prosecutors said.

9-MONTH-OLD GIRL DIES IN BURBANK APARTMENT FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 9-month-old girl died in what investigators believe was an accidental fire 
that broke out in a Burbank apartment where she was sleeping, authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The victim of the fire in the 400 block of West Alameda Avenue was identified 
by Burbank police as Brittany Wright. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said her mother, Debra Wright, 32, was treated for smoke inhalation 
and emotional stress after the fire about 9 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was ignited in a bedroom where the girl was sleeping, the Burbank Fire 
Department said. The exact cause of the blaze remained under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We preliminarily show it as accidental, but we don't have enough information 
to pinpoint exactly what it was," Battalion Chief Stan Nelson said. "There is 
so much rubble in there it makes it difficult to make a determination." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said investigators sent a lamp and other appliances that were in the 
burned bedroom to a laboratory to determine if an electrical short started the 
blaze. The results may take several days, he said. On Wednesday evening, the 
child had been sick and was put to bed by her mother, who left the bedroom and 
fell asleep on a couch in the living room, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
About 9:05 p.m., a passer-by saw the smoke and flames in the first-floor 
apartment of a three-floor complex and pounded on the door, waking the mother, 
Nelson said. The bedroom was engulfed in flames, and the mother and other 
residents were unable to save the girl, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 firefighters quickly doused the flames and removed the victim, who had 
severe burns and suffered from smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
She was taken to St. Joseph Medical Center, where efforts to revive her were 
unsuccessful.

ROBIN ELSON MURDER ACQUITTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have read the article on Robin Elson, and have a tremendous feeling of rage 
and anger with regard to her neighbors who were so busy watching her husband 
brutally attack his family but too cowardly to call the police. Had they done 
so, this woman may have been spared God knows how much cruelty, to say nothing 
of what her children have suffered. 
</P>
<P>
There is no way on earth a jury could have found her guilty, if there is any 
justice left. 
</P>
<P>
Shame, shame, shame not only on the dead man but on the neighbors who saw small 
children treated with such inhuman cruelty and did nothing. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder how those uncaring neighbors sleep at night. Not too well, I hope.

ROBIN ELSON MURDER ACQUITTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is with great fury that I sit down and compose this letter. I just finished 
the article by Faye Fiore regarding Robin Elson ("A Battered Wife Wins 
Acquittal in Murder Case," Metro, Dec. 26). 
</P>
<P>
The story mentions several neighbors who were aware of the abuse taking place 
in the Elson household but were "too scared" to do anything about it. These 
people belong in jail. To me they are just as guilty as Jack Elson for watching 
and doing nothing while innocent children's lives were in grave danger. How 
these people can sleep at night is something I will never understand. 
</P>
<P>
What kind of country are we turning into when a neighbor can watch a man shove 
a garden hose down the throat of an 18-month-old baby? And then she wonders in 
amazement why "the kid" didn't die. 
</P>
<P>
I pray that when I have children and if they are ever in need of assistance 
that I don't get stuck with neighbors as inhumane as the ones Robin Elson had.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was delighted to note in "Only in L.A." (Metro, Dec. 22) that the decorative 
lobby of the defunct Herald Examiner is coming into its own as an available 
movie set. 
</P>
<P>
The building was the work of architect Julia Morgan, who was commissioned to 
design the sumptuous headquarters by William Randolph Hearst himself. It was 
her first extensive project for Hearst, resulting in a close collaboration that 
lasted for well over a quarter of a century and culminated in the Hearst 
Castle. Long before women's lib, Morgan was a pioneering professional, a 
dedicated architect whose life and achievements are discussed in a stunning new 
book, "Julia Morgan, Architect," by Sara Holmes Boutelle.

RIGHTS OF UNBORN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Milos Klvana has been convicted of murder in the cases of eight babies and 
a fetus (Part A, Dec. 19). 
</P>
<P>
This fetus received equal treatment by the law as the full-term babies. 
</P>
<P>
If an obstetrician can be found guilty of murder under "implied malice" for the 
death of a fetus, what should the charge be for a doctor who takes the life of 
the fetus through abortion? The same -- murder. 
</P>
<P>
Our laws are grossly inconsistent regarding the legal rights of the unborn. All 
unborn children deserve equal protection under the law.

DRUG CRIME SENTENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We seem to have one way of acting when a problem confronts us -- to identify 
the "enemy," go to war, and trample him into submission. The world has operated 
this way for thousands of years. Today it is even reflected in our language; 
the war on poverty, war on hunger, war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
It was therefore hopeful to read Fairchild's article, for it raises our 
awareness of another way of functioning. 
</P>
<P>
These wars are not working. They do not stop terrorism, they do not stop drug 
use, and we certainly have not been able enforce our will on the environment. 
Now is a good time to start to thinking differently. As Fairchild proposes, let 
us work to end the underlying causes of these problems. Let us figure out how 
to help the individual move himself beyond hunger, homelessness and the despair 
that leads to drugs and terrorism.

The court is to be commended for its wisdom. Robin Elson is to be praised for

For her three precious children, let us pray that their tortured lives can

JUROR FAIRNESS WOULD BE ON TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Alan M. Dershowitz's syndicated column. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that we have him, can we give him a fair trial? That's the question that 
lawyers around the country are asking on the heels of Manuel Noriega's dramatic 
surrender to American authorities. 
</P>
<P>
There are no easy answers, because there is really no precedent for a jury 
trial of a deposed dictator charged with drug crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Never before in American history has a jury of 12 ordinary Americans been asked 
to sit in judgment on a major foreign policy goal of a President. Brave 
soldiers died in order to bring Noriega to justice. Can we really expect jurors 
to decide that these soldiers died in vain if they conclude that Noriega is 
probably guilty but there is a reasonable doubt? 
</P>
<P>
In previous situations where American foreign policy has demanded the 
conviction of deposed tyrants -- for example, at the post-World War II war 
criminal tribunals -- the cases were submitted to judges or to courts-martial, 
rather than jurors. The same was true of the trial of the murderers of 
President Abraham Lincoln at the close of the Civil War. It is expecting far 
too much from ordinary jurors to insist that they maintain a presumption of 
innocence when the President has put the prestige of our nation behind the 
claim that Noriega is a common criminal. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega has the option of waiving a jury trial and asking for a judge, but he 
has the constitutional right to demand a jury trial that is fair. The Noriega 
case poses a challenging test for the American judicial system. Juries work 
best in small cases involving obscure defendants. They do not work well in 
highly publicized cases involving notorious defendants. And they are at their 
worst when their patriotism is pitted against the rights of the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
Judges, who are given the protection of life tenure, are supposed to assure the 
independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers. The federal judge 
who presides over the Noriega case will have more than the fate of Manuel 
Noriega in his hands. The integrity of the American system of justice will be 
on trial in that Florida courtroom.

THE IMPERIAL MYTH DEFLATES; 
</P>
<P>
PANAMA: LIBERALS WERE SURE U.S. INTERVENTION WOULD AROUSE PANAMANIAN 
NATIONALISM. IT DID -- AGAINST NORIEGA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT S. LEIKEN, Robert S. Leiken is a senior associate at the Harvard 
University Center for International Affairs. He is working on a book on 
contemporary Central America. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The storming of Panama that overthrew Manuel Noriega battered some cherished 
liberal myths in the process. Among the minor casualties was the notion that 
George Bush had too much to fear from Noriega to bring him here for trial. The 
major casuality was the belief that a U.S. intervention anywhere in Latin 
America must be repudiated by the local population. 
</P>
<P>
Just before Noriega's escape into the Vatican embassy, a leading exponent of 
this view, former Ambassador Robert White, warned in a television interview 
that the invasion "arouses the nationalism of the people." Popular nationalism, 
said this diplomat with a distinguished record of service in the region, would 
enable Noriega to "remain at large and lead a guerrilla operation against 
American troops," leaving the United States "bogged down, with . . . much loss 
of life from guerrilla operations and street-to-street fighting." Similar 
expectations were widely voiced by news correspondents, media pundits and Latin 
American experts. 
</P>
<P>
In actuality, Panamanian nationalism was expressed in demonstrations against 
Noriega, not the United States. "There's nothing we can do to hold back these 
people," said a U.S. soldier standing guard outside the Vatican embassy 
Wednesday as tens of thousands of Panamanians massed to demand that Noriega be 
turned over to the U.S. Army. It was word of this menacing crowd that persuaded 
Noriega to stop imposing on the Pope's hospitality. On hearing of his 
surrender, the gleeful demonstrators spread across the city, forcing U.S. 
troops to give up trying to enforce the nightly curfew that had been in place 
since the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the media and the professors still insist on calling the new 
Panamanian regime led by President Guillermo Endara a creature of the U.S. 
government. They ignore the fact that Panamanians elected the Endara ticket by 
a 3-1 majority despite Noriega's goons. The people then sustained an opposition 
that braved bloody beatings and torture by Noriega's so-called Dignity 
Battalions. 
</P>
<P>
Is the history of popular resistance to Noriega ignored because it was sparked 
in September, 1985, by one Hugo Spadafora? A former Panamanian vice minister of 
health, he joined the Sandinistas to fight Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio 
Somoza. When the Sandinistas won and then suppressed their democratic allies, 
Spadafora joined other ex-Sandinistas and Miskito Indians to fight the new 
Nicaraguan dictatorship. When Spadafora returned to Panama and denounced Gen. 
Noriega's corruption, he was tortured and beheaded. The slaughter of the 
popular hero sent thousands of Panamanians into the streets calling for justice 
in what eventually became the anti-Noriega electoral movement. 
</P>
<P>
The popular movement was reborn Wednesday in the mass demonstration outside the 
Vatican embassy. It was not only against Noriega; it also demanded an end to 
the repressive militarism of the Panamanian Defense Forces. 
</P>
<P>
The PDF, as Noriega had renamed the National Guard, was created by the United 
States in the 1960s to help defend the canal, was backed morally and 
politically in the 1970s by American liberal champions of the "progressive and 
nationalist military" in places like Panama and Peru, and turned into a monster 
fed by Colombian drug money in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Noriega's main allies have been the Sandinistas and the Cubans, who 
sent teams of advisers to carry out such glorious tasks as organizing the 
notorious Dignity Battalions. These confederations of ex-cons and self-styled 
revolutionaries terrorized the population during the Noriega years, and in 
response to the U.S. invasion looted and burned whole neighborhoods. They are 
modeled on the Sandinista turbas, who are even now bullying Nicaragua's 
democratic opposition with Noriega-style tactics. Domestically, a fundamental 
mainstay of Noriega's rule was the Communist People's Party, which supplied 
leadership for the Dignity Battalions. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that most Latin leaders condemned the invasion, at least publicly. 
Anti-Americanism remains a handy if worn demagogic tool for elites needing a 
whipping boy on which to pin their own fiascoes. But even the Organization of 
American States rejected Cuba and Nicaragua's bid to condemn the United States 
in favor of a much milder reproach. That reproach was itself reproached 
overwhelmingly by those Latins most affected and most entitled to speak, the 
Panamanians themselves. 
</P>
<P>
None of this justifies a return to the bad old days when the United States felt 
entitled to intervene in the region at will. History -- the U.S. building of 
the canal, our presence in the Canal Zone, our creation of the National Guard 
and of Panama itself -- makes this a special case. But it is time that some 
liberals pulled their heads out of the rubble long enough to notice that their 
Imperial Myth is walking around naked. They could start by thinking through the 
concept of "U.S. intervention" from the point of view of the people involved. 
Grenada today is a functioning democracy and enjoys sufficient independence 
from the United States to have voted with the Latin bloc in U.N. and OAS 
resolutions against the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
There is a difference between an intervention that imposes a dictator and one 
that removes one. A patron saint of true modern liberalism, John Stuart Mill, 
wrote: "The doctrine of non-intervention, to be a legitimate principle of 
morality, must be accepted by all governments. The despots must consent to be 
bound by it as well as the free States. Unless they do, the profession of it by 
free countries comes but to this miserable issue, that the wrong side may help 
the wrong, but the right must not help the right." It would be a sad irony if a 
perverse tenacity leads liberals to become the new apologists for the tyrannies 
that liberalism was created to oppose.

INTERVENTION: OVERLOADED WITH A SENSE OF ITS OWN MORAL SUPERIORITY, THE U.S. 
NOW THINKS IT CAN IMPOSE ITS JUSTICE ON OTHERS WILLY-NILLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM PFAFF, William Pfaff is a Los Angeles Times syndicated columnist 
based in Paris. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What has happened in Panama, climaxing in the removal of Gen. Manuel Noriega to 
the United States, is part of a pattern of recent U.S. conduct that is of 
considerable novelty and significance. 
</P>
<P>
This has not been just one more U.S. military intervention in the Americas. 
Past interventions were usually commercial, protecting U.S. investments or 
"restoring order." The invasion of Cuba in 1898, and of what now is Panama 
(then Colombian territory) in 1903, grew out of imperialist assumptions 
characteristic of the period. 
</P>
<P>
Post-1945 U.S. interventions -- Guatemala in 1954, the Bay of Pigs in 1960, the 
Dominican Republic in 1965, Grenada in 1983, the Contras in Nicaragua in the 
Reagan years -- were given ideological justification. They defended Texas and 
New Mexico against communism. (Vietnam was held to be the first line of defense 
for Hawaii.) 
</P>
<P>
But with Panama we have a new and radical argument. The United States invaded 
Panama in order to seize a chief of state held to be a fugitive from U.S. 
justice. The invasion followed findings by Administration lawyers that American 
law-enforcement agents and soldiers have the authority to seize fugitives 
abroad, in disregard of the sovereignty of other governments. 
</P>
<P>
After the failed Oct. 3 coup attempt in Panama, the White House also made it 
known that it was re-examining rules concerning the assassination of foreign 
chiefs of state and other persons, posing the question, according to a Bush 
Administration spokesman, as to whether "a less restrictive reading" of the 
Ford Administration's executive order banning involvement in assassinations 
"would be in the national interest." Other states might commit assassinations, 
but only the United States proposes it as national policy. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in 1988, the United States kidnaped a drug dealer in Honduras, again 
because of an indictment in the United States, thereby provoking an angry 
Honduran reaction. Before that, the Justice Department made it known that it 
contemplated legal action in U.S. courts against the prime minister of the 
Bahamas, against Ferdinand Marcos (when he was president of the Philippines) 
and against Egypt's defense minister (for an alleged intelligence operation 
targeting U.S. technology). 
</P>
<P>
These matters of criminal justice have been accompanied by efforts by the U.S. 
government to extend the reach of American business and banking law, and 
securities trading restrictions, to countries abroad. A Justice Department 
official said in 1988 that "we have to prove to the world that our legal system 
is one that stands for the proposition that crime will not be condoned whatever 
the offender's state or status." 
</P>
<P>
What this translates to, of course, is that the United States will, to the best 
of its ability, unilaterally impose its conceptions of law, justice and 
national interest within other countries, in disregard of their sovereignty. It 
surely amounts to a proposition that the United States considers itself beyond 
the constraints of international law and convention. 
</P>
<P>
In a brilliant new book on the cultural implications of World War I, "Rites of 
Spring," Modris Eksteins of the University of Toronto writes that Germany in 
August, 1914, "had no concrete war aims, only a strategy and a vision, that of 
German expansion in an existential rather than a physical sense." Germans acted 
from convictions of "moral superiority," "moral strength" and "moral right." 
</P>
<P>
Because of this sense of moral superiority and moral isolation, "the Germans 
had been, even before the war, the most readily inclined of the leading nations 
to question the norms and values of 19th-Century liberal bourgeois society, to 
elevate the moment beyond the grasp of the law." 
</P>
<P>
From this followed Germany's wartime lack of scruple about violating Belgium's 
neutrality, attacking civilian targets and introducing unrestricted submarine 
warfare and gas and flame weapons, thus overturning what previously had been 
the accepted morality of warfare among civilized nations. All of this, one 
scarcely need add, ended very badly for the Germans, and for nearly everyone 
else. We have since 1914 failed to recover that lost morality. 
</P>
<P>
The analogy I draw is not a comfortable one. The parallel between America's 
present challenge to international convention and law and that of Germany in 
1914 obviously is relative, not absolute, and takes place in very different 
international circumstances. Yet a parallel is there, and it is essential, I 
think, that attention be drawn to it.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OUTAGE CLOSES COURTHOUSE FOR A DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A complete power outage at the Torrance courthouse forced closure of the 
building all day Thursday, after Southern California Edison workers said it 
would take hours to repair the cable that caused the blackout. 
</P>
<P>
Clocks in the courthouse stopped at 2 a.m., but the power failure was not 
discovered until court employees began arriving for work at 7:30 a.m. Workers 
reported that auxiliary power provided some light for the first part of the 
morning, but eventually even that was lost as crews began working on the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Power was restored at 4:05 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Edison spokesman Ted Porter said a cable inside a flooded underground vault at 
Madrona and Maple avenues failed, damaging the vault's fuse cabinet and a 
connector. It was nearly 10 a.m. before Edison workers could drain the vault 
enough to see that major components would have to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, judges ordered the courthouse closed, telling people with 
Thursday court dates to return today. 
</P>
<P>
"We told them to just shut it down for the day rather than have all these 
people standing around waiting," Porter said.

RIVAL SPRAY PAINT ARTISTS PLAN LEGAL WALL-TO-WALL SHOWDOWN; 
</P>
<P>
GRAFFITI: LIKE '60S FLOWER POWER AND '70S PUNK, HIP-HOP IS BOPPING RIGHT INTO 
MAINSTREAM CULTURE. ITS AEROSOL MURALISTS EDGE TOWARD THE CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Michelangelo had the Sistine Chapel. On this early Sunday morning, "Slick," a 
22-year-old graffiti artist from Baldwin Park, has the back wall of the Levitz 
furniture warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
He also has an aluminum ladder for those hard-to-reach spots, a plastic milk 
crate stuffed with cans of spray paint and an artistic vision. 
</P>
<P>
"The can is my brush," Slick says, standing knee-deep in weeds on a desolate 
strip of land between the Levitz warehouse and the Los Angeles River. "The wall 
is my easel and canvas." 
</P>
<P>
His latest work-in-progress is an enormous Superman in vivid reds, blues and 
flesh tones. Cape flying, Superman clutches a goofy-looking human figure with 
one hand while winding up for a punch (kazow!) with the other. 
</P>
<P>
But more than artistic expression is at stake here. 
</P>
<P>
Slick is warming up to challenge "Hex," another graffiti artist who has been up 
on Melrose Avenue, flaunting his talents by spray-painting a huge Batman. Slick 
has vowed to "take out" the archrival he calls "Hoax." This weekend, starting 
today, the two plan to battle for the title of graffiti king, dueling with cans 
of spray paint at this industrial site. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to make a Super-Slick, dedicated to dissing him, crushing his bat," 
Slick says. "Ever since he came to town he's been irritating me." 
</P>
<P>
Spray-painting a wall without permission is still illegal, of course. Those 
convicted face fines of up to $50,000 and a maximum prison term of one year. 
And property owners must clean up graffiti or face fines of up to $1,000 and a 
maximum jail term of six months. 
</P>
<P>
But some authorities are beginning to draw a sharp distinction between the 
growing number of "aerosol artists" who paint graffiti-inspired murals and the 
street gang members who write their names -- in a practice called "tagging" -- 
on everything from RTD buses to schoolyard walls. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing more and more of those big, nice-looking ones in 3-D and 
different colors. They're different from our gang graffiti," said Detective 
Robert Contreras, a member of the Los Angeles Police Department gang 
information section. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, public agencies and private firms are even considering setting 
aside wall space for the aerosol artists, providing they agree to pressure 
others to stop tagging -- which more sophisticated artists consider unsightly. 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma is that, although some authorities believe the young artists need a 
place to paint, "If they don't get permission, it's still against the law," 
Contreras warns. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the world of graffiti art. With one foot in the police station and 
the other in the art gallery, the phenomenon, which started in New York in the 
1970s, is hot today in Los Angeles, where the city's horizontal sprawl and 
abandoned industrial spaces provide countless opportunities to leave one's 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
It's all part of "hip-hop," a subculture that blends elements of rap music, 
skateboarding, underground dance clubs and graffiti art. In the past year, Los 
Angeles has become the acknowledged center of hip-hop. There is even "Ghetto 
Art," a publication that is subtitled "Los Angeles' Only Aerosol Newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
Aerosol artists say they are motivated by a desire to create, not destroy. 
Their crews -- groups that spray-paint together -- are highly organized, with 
their own codes and styles. Whereas a few admit to being current or former gang 
members, most see graffiti as a positive way to channel pent-up energy. 
</P>
<P>
"We make a real point of saying we're not affiliated with any gang," says 
"Frame," a friend of Slick, who sometimes "bombs" -- paints -- with him. Frame 
says up to 90% of the estimated 500 or more local graffiti artists are just 
creative kids. 
</P>
<P>
The police, however, say up to 80% of the city's graffiti are still scrawled by 
gang members and delinquents. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever its motives, hip-hop, like '60s flower power and '70s punk, is bopping 
right into the mainstream culture. Its influence has already seeped into 
fashion, design, film, music, dance and billboard advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at some of the lettering used in advertising today, and you see it 
came directly from graffiti art," said Jim Prigoff, a self-styled graffiti 
expert whose book "Spray Can Art" has sold 55,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
If L.A. is the center of hip-hop, Slick is one of the key players. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, he and his partner "Risk" walked away with first prize at "Street 
'89," an International Street Art Festival held in East Yorkshire, England. The 
duo, who call themselves The Aerosolics, were asked by New York graffiti artist 
"Vulcan" to represent the United States. Their 20-by-6-foot mural beat out 
graffiti art from Denmark, Italy and nine other countries. 
</P>
<P>
The dynamic duo aren't given to modesty. "Risk rules the lettering, and no one 
can burn my characters," says Slick, whose given name is Richard Wyrgatscht. He 
stands more than six feet tall. His head is shaved, except for one long black 
strand that hangs down over his forehead. He keeps a large, black scorpion 
named Bertha. 
</P>
<P>
But far from being a gang member, Slick is a middle-class guy whose father is a 
policeman in Hawaii. His partner, Risk, lives in an upper middle-class Westside 
suburb. Graffiti art has definitely gone uptown since primitive man first 
scrawled on a cave wall. Today's subculture heroes, including The Aerosolics, 
come equipped with faxes, pagers and Day-Glo business cards to promote 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
What puts Slick ahead of the pack is his talent at " 'piecing" -- short for 
creating masterpieces. Unlike most other youths painting the town, Slick is a 
trained artist who could parlay his graffiti art into a career, say those 
familiar with his work. 
</P>
<P>
At Pasadena's Art Center College of Design, where he once studied illustration, 
Slick showed "tremendous potential," said Philip Hays, chairman of Art Center's 
illustration department. "The guy can draw beautifully in a traditional sense. 
He's a really good draftsman." 
</P>
<P>
Hays sees a parallel between Slick's work and that of Keith Haring, the New 
York East Village graffiti artist who spray-painted his way to fame in the 
1970s on the city's subways. Slick is part of the second generation, and his 
3-D figures have spawned a host of copycat artists, Hays said. 
</P>
<P>
Slick got his start in Hawaii, painting petroglyph-inspired figures while in 
high school. But after seeing "Wild Style," a movie about New York rap and 
graffiti artists, he traded in his paintbrush for a can and began to spray. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, he moved to Los Angeles to attend the Art Center. In between 
drawing Michelangelo-inspired nudes, he honed his cartoon characters on the 
walls of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He dropped out of Art Center in late 1989. Now, primarily supported by his 
parents and friends, he weighs whether he should go back. There are so many 
options. He hears that the Japanese might pay up to $4,000 for hand-painted 
leather jackets emblazoned with his characters. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike walls, which get painted over, jackets are permanent. And Slick is 
enough of an artist to be attracted to the idea of permanence. 
</P>
<P>
He won't even call his work graffiti. "We don't use the G word," Slick said 
solemnly. "That confuses people." 
</P>
<P>
And he is giving legitimate art galleries a try. 
</P>
<P>
His first big break came this fall, when the Pico House Galleria in downtown 
Los Angeles included one of his works in a graffiti art exhibition. Although 
Slick didn't sell anything, the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art for the 
first time signaled an interest in Los Angeles graffiti art when it picked up a 
work by an artist named "Mondoe," said museum spokeswoman Angela Escobar. 
</P>
<P>
But Slick worries about the future and that "there's so much negativity 
associated with a can." 
</P>
<P>
To squelch some of those bad feelings, Slick and his friends sometimes get 
permission now before they whip out their spray cans. 
</P>
<P>
On this recent Sunday, Slick and Frame had gotten the thumbs up from Levitz, 
which has long fought a losing battle with "the ugly kind of graffiti," said 
Anita Tellez, operations manager for the store, located on the Los 
Angeles-Glendale city line. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, we've been pretty pleased; they've put up some interesting artwork," 
Tellez said of the building's rear walls, which are covered with 'pieces and 
great big swirling 3-D names with characters or skylines sprouting from them. 
</P>
<P>
In between slugs from a bottle of mineral water, Slick wields his spray can 
like a paintbrush. His arm makes large arcs as he shades in five different 
colors to show Superman's muscle tone. A few more deft strokes and a torso 
emerges, twisted and tortured, reminiscent of the German Expressionism of Egon 
Schiele. 
</P>
<P>
Slick and Frame are putting up a message as well. In big, bold letters it says: 
"PLEASE RESPECT. NO TAGGING." 
</P>
<P>
Tagging "makes the rest of the neighborhood look all thrashed," Slick said, 
sounding for a moment like a peevish burgher. "Most property owners, they don't 
mind the mural art, but when kids write their names they get mad." 
</P>
<P>
Still, even artistic graffiti frequently is on the wrong side of the law. Many 
artists admit they steal their paint, which runs $4 a can over the counter. 
</P>
<P>
And not everybody draws distinctions between tagging and mural art. "It's all 
graffiti to us," says Detective Roger Mora, a spokesman for the Los Angeles 
Police Department. "If it goes up on a privately owned wall, it's going down." 
</P>
<P>
Graffiti artists concede that what they do is illegal. But they see themselves 
as outlaws, taking risks to make an artistic statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of graffiti art is getting up, getting fame in the most outrageous places 
possible, places that are illegal," Frame said. "Whether people accept it or 
not, to become kings on the street, to get fame, not with the media or the art 
world, but with the street, with our peers." 
</P>
<P>
But these young people also know that a dead end often lies at the bottom of a 
can of spray paint. Only one in a million of them will make it into the 
mainstream art world. 
</P>
<P>
"You should stay in school," one onlooker tells Slick. "Yeah," he responds. 
"Knowledge is king."

<P>
If you build it by the water, they will come. 
</P>
<P>
The trio of partners who own The Fish Market presumably didn't need a Voice to 
persuade them to build on one of the choicest parcels of San Diego shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody knows that ownership of a waterside restaurant entitles you to print 
money faster than you can say Alexander Hamilton. And a menu headlined by Puget 
Sound oysters, Oregon Dungeness crab and Catalina swordfish can only help. 
</P>
<P>
If a place on the water is good, the only thing that can beat it is a really 
huge place on the water. The Fish Market has built a monster of a seafood house 
on the tip of Tuna Harbor. This spit of land, formerly known as the G Street 
Mole, slices into San Diego Bay between the Navy supply pier and Seaport 
Village. 
</P>
<P>
The place definitely is pricey, but, although San Diegans generally are 
resistant to expensive restaurants, they seem drawn not only by the diversified 
and carefully prepared menu but by the boatwright-style wood decor and the 
grand bay views offered at virtually every table. It was jammed on a pair of 
visits between Christmas and New Year's. 
</P>
<P>
The Fish Market, part of a six-unit California chain that includes a successful 
Del Mar restaurant, has space in its two floors of dining rooms, lounges, 
outdoor decks and sushi and oyster bars to accommodate more than 600. This 
isn't a restaurant, it's a fishing village. 
</P>
<P>
Other major cities, especially those with convention centers, offer massive 
restaurants, and the opening of this city's first such establishment may 
suggest what is in store for San Diego in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The menus brim with a superb and wonderfully broad selection of seafoods, and 
-- wonder of wonders! -- the kitchens seem to prepare them uniformly well 
despite the sheer volume of orders. In addition to the sushi and oyster bars, 
which have their own lengthy menus, a distinction exists between the casual 
downstairs room and the relatively more formal and "gourmet" upstairs room, 
which is called Top of the Market. 
</P>
<P>
The lists in both duplicate each other to a fair degree and run to exhaustive 
surveys of raw and cooked shellfish, smoked fish, salads, chowders, pastas and 
grilled seafoods. The upstairs menu acknowledges reality by also offering lamb, 
veal and beef. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner in Top of the Market was a leisurely, well-served affair that opened 
with really fine shellfish. The Fish Market owns an interest in a Puget Sound 
oyster farm, and ships down coppery Belons, its own hybrid Westcott Bay oysters 
and Manila clams, all quite alive when placed in front of diners. A plate of a 
dozen tiny Olympias included several that still bore fragrant seaweed beards; 
Olympias are among the most delicate of oysters, and these were fine specimens. 
</P>
<P>
Seafood cocktails include such specialties as salmon ceviche and tiger prawns 
in spicy sauce, but the choicest is the Dungeness crab, sweet and briny and 
served lavishly, which is the only way it should be served (especially at 
$7.25, a price that would provoke fainting spells among the customers at 
seafood houses on the Oregon coast). The kitchen tops it with a dab of decent 
cocktail sauce but relies on the diner's good sense by also providing thick 
lemon wedges. 
</P>
<P>
A list of "specialty" starters includes roasted peppers with anchovies; prawns 
sauced with garlic, or with pesto, Sherry and chowder (!), or Mexican-style 
with peppers and cilantro; a bucket of assorted shellfish steamed in white 
wine, and Japanese-style ichiban of ahi, first marinated and then seared 
briefly to leave the interior quite rare. There are also a warm spinach salad 
with bay scallops and feta cheese; New England and Manhattan clam chowders, and 
several appetizer-sized pastas, including one in rough-hewn tomato sauce and 
another dressed with smoked salmon and cream. 
</P>
<P>
If the menu sounds like it goes on forever, well, it does, but it also has the 
virtue of avoiding the perfunctory in favor of thoughtful and imaginative 
preparations. Besides several clever and luxurious seafood pastas, the entree 
list offers barbecued fresh Idaho trout (most of what comes into town is 
frozen); mahi-mahi in lemon-lime cilantro sauce; steamed halibut with an 
Oriental-style flavoring of black beans and ginger, and tender sea scallops 
grilled in wrappings of the newly-available Italian prosciutto, which comes 
from Parma, the same place that gives us Parmesan cheese. This last was 
excellent. 
</P>
<P>
The list of simple grills recently has included Hawaiian hebi, Canadian salmon, 
local thresher shark, New Zealand John Dory and Catalina swordfish. The 
swordfish was, quite simply, amazing; moist, soft and gently marked by the 
grill, it tasted mildly of the coals, almost as if the smoke were a gentle 
seasoning. But, above all, it tasted remarkably fresh. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest splurge on the menu was local white abalone ($32.50 for a 
good-sized portion), rarely found in restaurants these days and even more 
rarely prepared with any style. A server assured that it was "exquisite," but 
while tender -- this costly seafood can be like shoe leather -- it also tasted 
quite bland under its lemony butter sauce. The sauteing process was evidently 
too gentle to crisp the abalone's flour coating, which properly carried out 
would have given the dish better definition. 
</P>
<P>
Top of the Market side dishes and desserts also are a little grander than those 
served downstairs. Southern California seafood houses typically serve a soggy 
goo -- the soggier and gooier the better -- that they call "rice pilaf." It is 
so standard than many diners may not know there is an alternative. The Fish 
Market's wild rice pilaf was grudgingly agreed to when the kitchen quite 
unaccountably ran out of french fried potatoes, but this toothsome, al dente 
blend of rice and broken vermicelli had excellent flavor and body. Among the 
desserts, a crisp almond tart chosen from a well-stocked pastry tray was 
likable for its caramelized glaze and intense flavor. 
</P>
<P>
The downstairs menu repeats many of the same starters, including the sashimi of 
Florida ahi and Japanese tuna, which is a well-presented offering of clean, 
fresh-tasting raw fish meant to be dipped in wasabi-powered soy sauce (wasabi 
is a particularly hot horseradish paste.) 
</P>
<P>
The entrees tend to be simpler in their approach, and the bulk of the very long 
list of fish and shellfish is char-broiled over mesquite. An attractive cut of 
Florida yellowfin tuna had been cooked beautifully and tasted beguilingly 
fresh, but the kitchen also, rather appallingly, had heavily dusted it with 
paprika. This is an old trick from the days of not-so-fresh fish and 
not-so-talented fish cooks, and it was surprising to encounter it here. 
</P>
<P>
The cioppino, on the other hand, was quite superior, except for the fact that 
the featured Dungeness crab legs had not been cracked and the meat was, 
therefore, inaccessible. This richly seasoned stew of tomatoes and seafood 
arrived in a low-sided but immense aluminum cooking vessel that, half full, 
contained several quarts at least; the sauce washed over sea scallops, large 
shrimp, juicy chunks of whatever fish with which the kitchen was oversupplied, 
and quantities of clams, domestic black mussels and New Zealand green lips, 
many of them submerged under puddles of molten Parmesan. 
</P>
<P>
Reservations are suggested for the Top of the Market, where dinner for two with 
a glass of wine each, tax and tip will cost $45 to $100. Dinner for two 
downstairs should run $35 to $60.

<P>
OAKLEY MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE IN RETURN TO LINEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Oakley didn't ease his way back into the lineup. He pushed and shoved, 
leading the New York Knicks to a 100-95 victory Thursday night over the Atlanta 
Hawks at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Oakley, returning after missing three games with an injury, played 36 minutes 
and sparked an 18-5 run in the fourth quarter as the Knicks won for the 10th 
time in 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
Oakley, who had sprained ligament in his right knee, scored 15 points and 
grabbed 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"At the start of the game, I was rushing everything," he said. "I was too 
excited. I made some quick fouls and some bad outlet passes. When I got back to 
the bench, I just told myself to calm down. I'm just glad to be back and 
contribute." 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Wilkins led the Knicks with 23 points, and Patrick Ewing had 19 points 
and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta's Dominique Wilkins scored 24 points despite nine-of-31 shooting and 
grabbed 13 rebounds. The Hawks have lost three of their last four games and 
three in a row on the road. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks outscored the Hawks, 32-20, in the third quarter to build an 82-70 
lead, but Atlanta closed to 82-78 early in the final period. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing, the NBA's third-leading scorer, failed to score in the first quarter and 
finished with only four points in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 112, Sacramento 98 -- A sellout crowd gave departing coach Jerry 
Reynolds a standing ovation, but Denver's Walter Davis spoiled the occasion 
with 27 points as the Nuggets beat the Kings in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 17,014 at Arco Arena gave Reynolds a one-minute ovation before his 
final game as coach. Dick Motta, hired Thursday, takes over Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Davis scored 17 of his 27 points in the second half for Denver. Fat Lever added 
23 points for the Nuggets. Wayman Tisdale led Sacramento with 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 100, Charlotte 98 -- Scott Roth had 16 fourth-quarter points as the 
Timberwolves extended the Hornets' road record to 0-12. The Hornets are the 
league's only winless team on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Armon Gilliam had 26 points for Charlotte, including 17 in the first half. Tony 
Campbell led Minnesota with 25 points and Corbin added 20. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 119, Dallas 102 -- The Suns, led by Tom Chambers with 35 points, shot 
75% in the second period at Phoenix to climb above .500 for the first time 
since November. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hornacek finished with 24 points while Eddie Johnson had 19 and Chambers 
13 rebounds as the Suns won for the fifth time in their last six games. Rolando 
Blackman led Dallas with 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 119, Miami 117 -- Chris Mullin and Mitch Richmond scored 27 points 
apiece and combined for all 21 of Golden State's points in a 7:36 stretch of 
the fourth quarter at Oakland as the Warriors extended the Heat's losing streak 
to eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Rony Seikaly scored 24 points and Billy Thompson had a career-high 17 rebounds 
for the Heat.

<P>
COFFEY STICKS AROUND TO SCORE WINNING GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Coffey escaped a high-sticking call and scored the game-winning goal 
Thursday night at Pittsburgh, giving the Penguins a 4-3 victory over the 
Vancouver Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
Coffey's teammate, Mario Lemieux, broke his team record by extending his 
point-scoring streak to 29 games, longest in the NHL this season, with two 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
Coffey slapped in Mark Recchi's pass from the top of the left faceoff circle 
for his 15th goal. The shot went in off a goal post to give Pittsburgh its 
third win in four games and drop Vancouver's road record to 4-14-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Canucks argued that Coffey never should have been around to score the 
winning goal. Rob Brown got a major penalty and a game misconduct for 
high-sticking Canuck captain Paul Reinhart. 
</P>
<P>
The Canucks contended it was Coffey's stick, not Brown's, that caught Reinhart 
in the chin, opening a cut that required nine stitches to close. 
</P>
<P>
Coffey pleaded not guilty, although he acknowledged the contact with Reinhart. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't even that much of a hit," Coffey said. "It was just a collision. I 
didn't put anything into it. I hit him with my shoulder and his own stick came 
up and caught him." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 4, Quebec 1 -- Gerard Gallant's power-play goal 59 seconds into the 
third period snapped a tie and sparked a three-goal spurt for the Red Wings at 
Detroit. Shawn Burr increased the lead to 3-1 and Jimmy Carson added a 
power-play goal with 5:28 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 4, Winnipeg 2 -- Ray Bourque's 45-foot goal with 1:41 remaining helped 
the Bruins to victory at Boston. Bob Gould, Craig Janney and Bob Sweeney had 
the other goals for the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 5, Philadelphia 4 -- Gino Cavallini scored with 2:16 left in overtime 
to give the Blues the victory. Cavallini converted from the right faceoff 
circle off a three-on-two break, off a pass by Paul MacLean. St. Louis scored 
all its previous goals in the third period after Philadelphia took a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 8, New York Rangers 2 -- Brian Bellows scored three goals and Dave 
Gagner added two as the North Stars handed the Rangers their fifth consecutive 
road defeat.

UC IRVINE HITS ROCK BOTTOM IN LOSS TO SAN JOSE, 75-69 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan stood, hands on hips, in front of the Anteaters' 
bench trying to make sense of what was happening at the Bren Center Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes after watching San Jose State pull away for its first Big West 
Conference victory in 18 games, Mulligan still couldn't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine hit bottom with a 75-69 loss to San Jose before 2,017. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we're the weakest team in the league, no question about it," 
Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine falls to 2-9 overall, 0-2 in Big West play. San Jose is 4-7, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Brooks, one of 15 newcomers Coach Stan Morrison has brought in, had a 
game-high 22 points to lead San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks had 11 of his 22 points in the first seven minutes of the second half to 
push San Jose into the lead, 48-44. 
</P>
<P>
The lead had gone back and forth until then. Irvine led, 34-33, at halftime, 
only the third time this season the Anteaters had the lead after 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine made one late run at San Jose, erasing an eight-point lead but couldn't 
take the lead after tying the score, 59-59, with 4:17 left. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Desiano, who added 12 points, made six free throws in the final 1:05 as San 
Jose held on. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Butler led Irvine with 17 points. Justin Anderson and Jeff Herdman had 12 
each. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine shot a season-low 36.9% from the field, 53.8% from the free-throw line 
and had 20 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're headed for the cellar this year," Butler said. "Everyone's 
looking at us as a win."

CRUM SEES IT COMING, LOUISVILLE CAN'T GET GOING IN LOSS

Louisville Coach Denny Crum saw in his team a lack of enthusiasm as it prepared 
for Thursday night's game against Cincinnati and therefore was not surprised 
that the Bearcats came away with a 71-66 upset over the No. 8-ranked Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an old adage that you get what you earn, and we earned a loss," Crum 
said. "I knew before the game we weren't ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Starks scored five of Cincinnati's final 11 points as the Bearcats turned 
back a late charge to win the Metro Conference opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to go out and play hard, get the rebounds and stick them back 
in," Starks said. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville, which faces UCLA Sunday, turned the ball over 15 times and its 
starting guards, LaBradford Smith and Keith Williams, were one of 14 from the 
field. Cincinnati scored 15 points off Louisville mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"We came in lackadaisical," said Louisville center Felton Spencer, who scored 
19 points. "We haven't been going as hard in practice the last two or three 
days." 
</P>
<P>
Louisville (9-2) rallied from a 37-26 halftime deficit to lead, 59-58, on 
Everick Sullivan's breakaway dunk with 4:07 remaining. But Cincinnati (8-3) 
regained the lead for good, 61-59, on Starks' three-point play with 3:36 left. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati, which posted its second victory in a row over Louisville in Freedom 
Hall, got 18 points from Banks and 15 apiece from Andre Tate and Levertis 
Robinson. Starks finished with 14. 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 Kansas 93, Wichita State 66 -- Terry Brown led five Jayhawks in double 
figures with 18 points as they made a school-record 11 three-point shots to win 
easily at Wichita. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas (14-0) made eight three-point baskets in the first half to bring the 
Shockers (4-7) out of their zone defense, and took a 52-30 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
No. 4 Illinois 73, Wisconsin 59 -- Kendall Gill, whose eligibility was restored 
by the NCAA earlier in the day, scored 20 points and led the Illini over the 
Badgers in the Big Ten Conference opener for both teams at Champaign, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Kaufmann added 11 points for the Illini (11-0). Danny Jones had 21 points 
and Willie Simms 18 for Wisconsin (9-4). 
</P>
<P>
Steve Bardo and Gill, considered one of the top backcourt duos in the country, 
were declared ineligible after officials learned they were not asked to follow 
all the steps on loan applications for used cars in 1989 -- a technical 
violation of NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
However, after the NCAA determined that the loan terms were appropriate and 
proper payments were being made, both players' eligibility was restored. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State 87, No. 11 Louisiana State 80 -- Doug Hartsfield made a pair 
of breakaway baskets early in overtime and added two free throws with 22 
seconds left to lead the Bulldogs to a Southeastern Conference victory at 
Starkville, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
In beating LSU for the fifth consecutive time, Mississippi State (8-2, 1-1) 
used a school-record nine three-point baskets and beat the Tigers (7-2, 0-1) in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore All-American guard Chris Jackson, who scored 14 of the Tigers' 16 
points in overtime, had 40 points. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico St. 81, Pacific 60 -- James Anderson scored 16 points and Reggie 
Jordan added 15 as the Aggies held the Tigers to 30% shooting in winning the 
Big West game at Las Cruces, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State (11-1, 2-0) won its ninth in a row, matching its longest 
winning streak since winning a school-record 16 in a row in 1968-69. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State 92, Tulane 68 -- Irving Thomas scored 23 points and Tharon Mayes 
had 22 as the Seminoles won the Metro Conference opener at Tallahassee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Christian scored 16 points and Anthony Reed 14 for Tulane (2-7), which 
played its first Metro game since the 1984-85 season, when the school suspended 
basketball after a point-shaving scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland 88, Wake Forest 82 -- Tony Massenburg scored 21 points and the 
Terrapins equaled their 1989 Atlantic Coast Conference victory total by winning 
the opener at College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
UC Santa Barbara 91, Utah State 66 -- Carrick DeHart scored 20 points and Gary 
Grey added 18 to lead the Gauchos in a Big West game at Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
UC Santa Barbara is 2-0 in conference play. Utah State is 1-1.

PINNING DOWN AN ATTITUDE; 
</P>
<P>
REBUILDING ROYAL'S WRESTLING PROGRAM, REED FINDS HE REALLY NEEDS AGGRAVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Reed doesn't worry about becoming aggravated and stressed out. On the 
contrary, despite all outward appearances, Reed strives to reach a state of 
edginess whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
He likes it there. It's where he feels most comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
And Reed, in his third season as Royal High's wrestling coach, strongly 
recommends that mind-set to his wrestlers. As far as Reed is concerned, it is 
wrestling's answer to visualizing success. It's an attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"You gotta be a hardhead," Reed said. "There's no two ways about it. And, you 
know, if you're not in that frame of mind, you're probably not a wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided what our motto should be: 'Aggravated and stressed out.' " 
</P>
<P>
Funny, but Reed doesn't look the least bit aggravated or stressed out. Instead, 
life seems rather rosy for the 41-year-old coach, although he has yet to 
complete his task of re-establishing a once formidable program. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Royal defeated perennial City Section power El Camino Real, 42-32, 
early this season and the Highlanders finished fourth in the 18-team Oxnard 
tournament last month. 
</P>
<P>
Reed was raised the son of a barber in Lamar, Colorado, a hamlet better known 
for basketball, football and baseball than for wrestling. Reed wrestled anyway, 
but only for three years in junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
"When I hit the 10th grade, I was 6-foot-3, and I was a basketball player," 
Reed said. "And I always felt I kind of got shafted, because basketball, to me, 
is an OK sport but wrestling is really a sport. I wish I had done it through 
high school." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Reed played for basketball, football and baseball teams that placed 
high in the Colorado playoffs, in the process laying a foundation for his 
coaching aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
The Reeds moved back to Oklahoma, where John was born, in the early 1960s 
("About 1964, when the Beatles came out, the barber business got really bad," 
he said). Reed continued playing baseball as a pitcher at Northwestern Oklahoma 
State, where he was a teammate of Mike Hargrove, who went on to become an 
American League Rookie of the Year with the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to strike him out," Reed said with a wry smile. 
</P>
<P>
Reed then bounced around until settling at Douglass High in Oklahoma City 
(perhaps best known for its football team's 56-game winning streak), where he 
coached the wrestling team from 1978 until 1986. Just before his first season 
at Douglass, Reed remembered a chance meeting with Stan Able, the wrestling 
coach at University of Oklahoma, several years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
He then made a phone call that has helped shape his coaching career. 
</P>
<P>
"I just called him and said, 'Stan, do you remember who I am?' " Reed said. 
"And he said, 'Oh, yeah.' I said, 'Would you mind if I come up and watch a few 
practices? It's been a long time for me.' 
</P>
<P>
"He was so great for me. He'd give me all kinds of instructions. I got better 
clinic out of a couple of weeks doing that than you could ever pay money for. 
And it worked out really neat, in that later on, before it got to be such a 
no-no thing to do, I got to take my kids down there to ostensibly just watch. 
But every once in a while one of my kids would talk one of the OU guys into 
wrestling, and they'd be rolling around down there. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd give us free tickets, and most of the kids I had then were of very modest 
income. We would load up in my van and tickets would be waiting at the gate. We 
got to see some great wrestling." 
</P>
<P>
Douglass' teams soared under Reed's tutelage, winning more than 70 dual matches 
in eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"John was energetic and a pretty good salesman and wanted to spread the word of 
wrestling," said Able, 52, who has coached the Sooners for 18 years. "He's a 
good promoter and takes great pride in the finished product." 
</P>
<P>
However, the blue-cold winters and searing summers of Oklahoma City disagreed 
with Reed, whose shoulder-length blond hair might have seemed out of place in 
the Midwest anyway. So, in 1986, Reed accepted a coaching position at Fillmore 
High, where he set about establishing a wrestling program. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, however, became disenchanted with the Flashes in a flash. Aggravated and 
stressed out, perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
"We practiced in the cafeteria," he said. "Bad enough that, but we would have 
to move the tables and put them back. I don't have a tremendous ego, but it 
really started to get on my nerves because it was making my kids feel like some 
sort of kitchen help. 
</P>
<P>
"And to be a wrestler, if you don't have some kind of pride that goes beyond 
moving tables around . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Reed turned the tables on Fillmore: Despite leading the Flashes to a 7-5 
record, he departed for Royal, a program in turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Royal actually was desperately seeking another Jerry Barnes, the coach from 
1968 to '82. The Highlanders won six Marmonte League championships under Barnes 
and had what was considered one of the area's top programs. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders have not won a league title since. In fact, Reed's teams have a 
2-11 league record since he took over. Although Royal is 15-18 in dual meets 
under Reed, including a 2-6 record this season, the Highlanders boast five 
wrestlers who competed in last year's Southern Section 4-A Division meet. 
</P>
<P>
Reed admits it may be difficult to forge a winning record this season. The 
Highlanders forfeit two of 13 weight classes every match because they can't 
fill the 97-pound and heavyweight divisions. But he still finds much to like 
about this season's team. 
</P>
<P>
"I may have my worst dual-meet record and yet have one of my best teams," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The victory over El Camino Real -- which came despite the forfeits -- might 
have been the match that changed the program's fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, El Camino Real beat Royal, 52-12. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the transformation can be attributed to the issue of forced busing that 
arose after that first El Camino Real match. 
</P>
<P>
Reed forced the bus driver and the managers off the bus, then forced his 
battered team to sit through a patented Reed tirade. Rumor has it that Reed's 
Oklahoma twang was heard all the way back in Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
"Royal is very good," El Camino Real Coach Milt Goffman said after this 
season's match. "A very good team. They have no holes in their lineup and they 
have a good athlete in every spot." 
</P>
<P>
Among them are Eric Landegger (9-2), a 105-pound senior who placed second in 
the league and seventh in the 4-A Division last season; David Jukes, a senior 
who is 10-5 at 138 pounds, but will compete at 132 pounds when league play 
starts; Richard Tucker (10-5), a 165-pound senior; and Billy Dobbs (10-5), a 
175-pound senior. 
</P>
<P>
By no coincidence, they all joined Reed when the coach showed up at the Simi 
Valley school. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years of hard time is not a very long time to absorb the nuances to be a 
complete wrestler," Reed said. "This year, we're beginning to show we're OK." 
</P>
<P>
That's OK, as in Oklahoma.

ROYAL UPSETS SIMI VALLEY ON LATE GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Daniel Morris scored from 10 yards out with two minutes remaining to give Royal 
High a 3-2 upset victory over previously undefeated Simi Valley on Thursday 
night in a Marmonte League boys' soccer match. 
</P>
<P>
One minute after Morris scored on a penalty kick to give Royal a 1-0 lead in 
the second half, Daniel Anderson fouled Simi Valley striker Kenny Greninger, 
setting up a Pioneer penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
Greninger took the shot, but Royal goalkeeper Steven Hambly dived to his right 
and deflected it. Marc Cargnel gathered the rebound and fired from 12 yards. 
Hambly, barely off the ground after Greninger's shot, dived to his left and 
made the block. 
</P>
<P>
"After I saved it (the first time), I saw where it was going," Hambly said. "I 
knew it was coming, but I didn't know where it was going. I just reacted." 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley (15-1, 1-1 in league play), ranked No. 1 in the Southern Section 
4-A Division, tied the score, 1-1, on Cargnel's head shot from 10 yards out at 
the 24-minute mark. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Brinkman found the lower left corner of the net on a penalty kick to give 
the Highlanders (11-2-1, 1-0) a 2-1 lead with 11 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Three minutes later, Cargnel had scored what appeared to be the equalizing 
goal, but the score was negated because the Pioneers were offsides. 
</P>
<P>
With five minutes remaining, Simi Valley striker Brian Weaver's penalty kick to 
the upper left corner tied the score, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Royal's victory avenged a 4-1 defeat to the Pioneers last month in the 
championship match of the Simi Valley tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a local derby," Royal Coach Peter Schraml said. "It's emotional. The 
Valley pride is at stake." 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley, however, was without the services of All-American midfielder Craig 
Hampton, who is playing with a U. S. national soccer team on the East Coast 
until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But Simi Valley Coach Andy Silva said that the Pioneers' loss could not be 
attributed to Hampton's absence. 
</P>
<P>
"We miss him on the field, obviously, but we're not going to say that we lost 
because he wasn't here. It just wasn't meant to be today at all."

ANTELOPE VALLEY WEATHERS FURIOUS CHAFFEY COMEBACK, TAKES CONFERENCE OPENER

<P>
The Antelope Valley basketball team traveled to Chaffey College on Thursday 
through the Cajon Pass, allowing the Marauders to avoid the notorious traffic 
tie-ups downtown commuters face on the rush-hour trek to this community about 
50 miles east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But at the end of the Foothill Conference opener the Marauders still managed to 
find themselves in a jam. 
</P>
<P>
Chaffey shrank Antelope Valley's 11-point halftime lead to two points, and with 
11 seconds to play the Panthers had the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Chaffey, however, was unable to get a final shot and Antelope Valley drove home 
with a 79-77 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley improved to 15-5 overall. Chaffey fell to 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the game in hand (at halftime)," Antelope Valley guard Paul Ernst said, 
"but we let them back in." 
</P>
<P>
Chaffey trailed, 46-35, at intermission but came back behind the outside 
shooting of Eric Madison and Martell Willis, who scored 20 and 18 points, 
respectively. Julian Brame (12 points) and Chris Henson (11) added several 
dunks. 
</P>
<P>
Ernst, however, made what proved to be the game-winning basket when he nailed a 
three-point basket to put Antelope Valley ahead, 79-72, with 2:50 to play. 
</P>
<P>
A dunk by Henson and a three-point shot by Willis brought Chaffey to within 
79-77 with 23 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
Ernst missed a free throw and Steve Walker failed to convert a follow shot on 
the rebound with 11 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
Chaffey then frantically brought the ball up court and couldn't get to within 
40 feet of the basket to try a shot. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley, once again, was without point guard Dedan Thomas, who missed 
last week's Desert tournament while serving a suspension for missing practice. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas was at Thursday's game but was not in uniform because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore forward Walter Brooks (20 points) and Ernst (19) picked up the slack 
for the Marauders. 
</P>
<P>
Ernst made five three-point shots to set a school single-season record. Ernst 
has made 56 three-point shots, breaking the record of 52 shared by Demetrius 
Jones and I. C. Lewis set during the 1986-87 season. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley forged its halftime lead behind forward Tony Madison and 
Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
Madison, a freshman from Dorsey High, scored nine points during a four-minute, 
17-2 run that began with the score tied, 29-29, with 4:21 remaining in the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Madison also handed out two assists to Brooks, who scored six points during the 
run. Madison finished with 15 points. Walker had 10 points and 13 rebounds and 
Joe Mantashigian added nine points for the Marauders. 
</P>
<P>
Chaffey had taken a 12-11 lead with 13:30 left in the first half on a dunk by 
Fabio Ribeiro.

NORTHRIDGE TRAVELS FRESH OFF A VICTORY

<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal State Northridge men's basketball team, fresh off a come-from-behind 
victory over Biola on Wednesday, will travel to Cedar City, Utah, for a 
nonconference game with Southern Utah State at 7:30 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (4-7), which snapped a three-game losing streak with its 62-54 
decision over Biola, will again be without the services of starting guard 
Eugene Humphrey, who suffered a severely bruised right thigh against Sacramento 
State last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Gene is really hurting right now," Coach Pete Cassidy said. "He's limping 
badly. We're just hoping now to have him back for the start of conference." 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Bill Mazurie will again start in Humphrey's place. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Derrick Gathers, who has led Northridge in both scoring and rebounding 
in six games this season, is averaging a team-high 20.4 points and 8.5 rebounds 
a game. 
</P>
<P>
After playing Division I Southern Utah State tonight, Northridge will return 
home to play Division III Colorado College on Monday. 
</P>

DAVE DISTEL: FRESH AIR AROUND BEATHARD BREATHES NEW LIFE INTO CHARGERS

<P>
Wait a minute. Let me see if I have this straight. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers have hired a general manager who is open, fun-loving, opinionated, 
laid-back and maybe even a little bit irreverent? 
</P>
<P>
Who'd they hire? Lee Trevino? Steve Martin? Or did Alex Spanos enlist his old 
buddy, Bob Hope? 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute. Let me see if I have this straight. 
</P>
<P>
The guy they hired is all those things, and he knows football? 
</P>
<P>
Who is this, Duffy Daugherty's ghost? 
</P>
<P>
In their own little way in their own little world, what the Chargers have done 
is tear down their own version of the Berlin Wall. This organization has 
forever been a closed society, withdrawn and suspicious. Everyone stepping off 
the elevator on floor 1-A at the stadium was considered a potential spy, or at 
least a threat to security. 
</P>
<P>
All of that should change now. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
Because Bobby Beathard won't change. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Beathard is the new general manager only because he will be allowed to 
run an organization the way he wants to run an organization. He wouldn't have 
taken the job if it came with a trench coat . . . and three barred doors 
between him and the public. 
</P>
<P>
A man with Beathard's talents has too many opportunities to have to settle for 
a job in a mausoleum, which the Charger front office had become. If Spanos 
wanted him -- and Spanos did Beathard's predecessor the disservice of saying he 
wanted him last spring -- he could only have him on Beathard's terms. 
</P>
<P>
After all, guys with Beathard's track record don't fall into your lap very 
often. Here was someone who had built five Super Bowl clubs, two in Miami and 
three in Washington. So he quits his job in Washington, thus becoming 
available. Lo and behold, he has a home in Leucadia and likes to run road races 
and surf. 
</P>
<P>
Spanos could not restrain his glee at this potential good fortune. He said he 
wanted to hire Beathard. Unfortunately, this was almost a year ago, and he 
already had a guy filling the only position that would interest Beathard. 
</P>
<P>
That man was Steve Ortmayer. Suddenly, 7-year-olds with whiffle-ball bats had 
more clout than he did. Any suggestions that anyone other than Spanos 
undermined Ortmayer and drove him into seclusion and ultimately out of office 
are ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, Ortmayer was far from the best of men to head an organization already 
bankrupt in terms of community relations. That he drafted well was forgotten 
because he traded poorly and had a credibility quotient of minus-59 when the 
chill factor was considered. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Beathard is the right guy to heat things up. 
</P>
<P>
Realistically, Beathard is not likely to draft a whole lot better than Ortmayer 
did, but he will improve the team if he can better assess veteran players 
obtained either via trades or Plan B free agency. 
</P>
<P>
And he has already improved the image of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
The team itself gave its fans hope with its strong finish. A 6-10 record did 
not represent improvement from 1988, but the end of this 6-10 season 
represented offensive improvement from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard's challenge is to get the offense what it needs to get into gear 
before the defense starts to decline. The Don Coryell Chargers didn't begin to 
assemble a semblance of a defense until the offense had slipped over the hill 
and ultimately down a cliff. 
</P>
<P>
What the Chargers have done, with their strong finish and the Beathard hiring, 
is give their fans a couple of reasons not to forfeit their season tickets en 
masse, which they might have done had they been asked to renew two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
What the Chargers also have done is establish themselves as a team on the 
upswing. And anyone who has followed the American Football Conference knows it 
does not take much of a swing to get from the bottom to the playoffs, because 
darned near anyone can make the playoffs from the AFC. It's just a good thing 
for the AFC that the Miami Hurricanes are not a National Football League team. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks from now, when Beathard's one-year tenure as a network color 
commentator comes to a close, a breath of air will hit town. It will not be a 
Santa Ana either, because this guy is fresh air rather than hot. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, maybe some of the Chargers' walls will start coming down. A 
new regime is taking over. It will likely realize that the guy delivering the 
bottled water isn't a spy sent by Al Davis or Sam Wyche or Jerry Glanville. 
</P>
<P>
And maybe Spanos will become a fan, no more and no less. Almost invariably, the 
smartest owners are the ones who realize how dumb they are, at least when it 
comes to football. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Spanos will find that he becomes smarter and smarter in direct relation to 
how little Bobby Beathard is burdened with his input. 
</P>
<P>
And he might just find that professional football doesn't have to be as dreary 
as downtown Stockton after 8 p.m. It might even be fun.

<P>
Rick Smith was fired as director of public relations for the Chargers in the 
10th front-office dismissal since mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 50, had worked for the organization for 15 years. He was replaced by 
Bill Johnston, 32, his former assistant and the club's director of community 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's firing was the latest in a front-office purge that began Dec. 18 with 
the dismissal of Steve Ortmayer as director of football operations. Others 
fired were Ortmayer's personal secretary, the five-member scouting staff and 
Ortmayer's top two lieutenants in the personnel department, Chet Franklin and 
Les Miller.

WEST COAST CONFERENCE; 
</P>
<P>
LIONS HAVE ONLY WINNING RECORD AS TEAMS LIMP INTO LEAGUE PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state of the West Coast Conference on the eve of its 38th year of men's 
basketball competition perhaps can best be indicated with two items: 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount is the only team in the WCC with a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
The University of San Diego has the conference's longest winning streak -- two. 
</P>
<P>
USD will try to make it three in a row when it opens WCC play against Santa 
Clara at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at the USD Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
Now, either WCC teams are playing pre-conference schedules Lou Holtz would brag 
about, or the conference is down this year. 
</P>
<P>
WCC officials would like to believe the former. But the truth is that, other 
than Loyola Marymount, teams have been terribly inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Lions (7-3) have lost some of their roar, losing, 115-113, to Xavier 
Tuesday after making it into the Top 25 (25th) for the first time this year. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine, picked by many to win the conference, has had back-to-back 
victories exactly once this season. After losing to Monmouth (N.J.) Tuesday, it 
defeated Towson State (Md.) Wednesday to even its record at 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
Portland (3-10) has not had consecutive victories since December 1987. 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary's, 25-5 last season, likely will reverse that this year. The Gaels are 
2-9 after five starters completed their eligibility last season. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco lost Mark McCathrion and Kevin Mouton from last year and had to 
go to overtime before defeating Mount St. Mary's (Md.) to avoid its 10th loss 
in 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara (3-9) lost to Mount St. Mary's, 69-62, the night before and is off 
to its worst start in Carroll Williams' 20-year coaching tenure. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzaga (4-8) began the season 3-1 but has since lost six of seven. 
</P>
<P>
USD, which envisioned riding a four-game streak into conference play but lost 
two games at home to Big Sky teams the week before Christmas, is third in the 
WCC with a 5-7 record. 
</P>
<P>
Relatively speaking, though, USD has been most consistent. Its seven losses are 
to teams with better records, its five victories against those with poorer 
marks. 
</P>
<P>
Heading into this week, teams that have beaten USD had a combined 48-24 record. 
Two -- UCLA and St. John's -- were ranked in the Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
But to count the victories of the five teams the Toreros defeated, removing 
just one mitten was necessary. They had a combined 5-49 record on New Year's 
Day. Western Kentucky was 3-7, Columbia 2-7. North Texas State (0-13), Stephen 
F. Austin (0-9) and Cal Lutheran (0-13) had yet to win. North Texas State and 
Stephen F. Austin (both Southland Conference schools) made up half the number 
of winless teams among the 294 NCAA Division I programs. Cal Lutheran is an 
NAIA team. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the WCC had a record-high four teams in postseason play. Loyola 
Marymount and St. Mary's played in the NCAA Tournament, Pepperdine and Santa 
Clara in the National Invitation Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
A Loyola Marymount player leads the conference or is tied in every individual 
statistical category except three-point percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Kimble leads the nation in scoring at 38.9 points per game. Hank Gathers, 
back after missing two games because of a fainting incident Dec. 9 against UC 
Santa Barbara, is second in WCC scoring (27.6 average) and first in rebounding 
averaging (13). Jeff Fryer is third in scoring at 23.8. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Bell (5-feet-10) is starting at point guard this year for USF after 
walking on last year. While Bell may not have been expecting much playing time, 
consider the predicament of John Glavan, a red-shirt freshman center. 
</P>
<P>
Glavan had played just one minute all season, and on a recent trip to Hawaii 
for the Rainbow Tournament, he not only didn't expect to play, but didn't even 
bother to pack a jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Using spare threads, Glavan played plenty, leading the Dons with 11 points 
against Hawaii and finishing three games with 16 points on eight-of-14 
shooting, plus 16 rebounds and four blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
It's a family tradition. Gonzaga has had a McPhee on its roster for 10 
consecutive seasons. fifth-year senior Jim McPhee leads the Bulldogs with a 
21.1-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara's front line is easily the biggest in the conference and certainly 
one of the biggest in the nation. With four players over 6-10, the Bulldogs 
could have a front line averaging 6-11 and more than 250 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
One giant in particular is sophomore Ron Reis (7-1, 285 pounds). When Reis was 
at Cupertino High in the Bay Area, his summer league team came to the Southland 
to play a team featuring USD guard Gylan Dottin. "He was just monstrous," 
Dottin said. "We were sophomores in high school, and we thought the guy was 27 
or something." 
</P>

SUMMER TALE OF GHOSTBUSTING, PARAPSYCHOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Julian's House by Judith Hawkes (Ticknor &amp; Fields: $18.95; 345 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
Ghostbusters for grown-ups, "Julian's House" is crammed with information about 
parapsychology. The agreeable young couple who rent the haunted Gilfoy house in 
the pleasant Massachusetts town of Skipton both have advanced degrees in the 
field, and plan to write a definitive paper on their summer adventures. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Gilfoy house is fully furnished with a spirit presence that 
manifests itself in multiple ways, the Curtisses must supply the modern 
conveniences of their profession. All they get with the lease is a history of a 
bobbing light, a freezing draft in the master bedroom, an assortment of knocks 
and thumps, the howling of an invisible dog and an unconfirmed report of a 
green face at an attic window. To capture these elusive phenomena in action, 
they've borrowed the most advanced and sophisticated tools of their trade: 
cameras triggered by disturbances in the air; buzzers activated by subtle 
gradations in sound, light, heat and cold; tape recorders sensitive to noise 
unheard by human ears, and capacitance meters, which measure changes in the 
electromagnetic field. In addition to this carload full of state-of-the-art 
paraphernalia, David and Sally Curtiss have also brought along some marital 
problems, which they hope will be resolved by a summer of working together in 
this idyllic setting. 
</P>
<P>
They begin their research by sending out questionnaires to all previous tenants 
of the house, and are gratified by prompt replies corroborating the 
disturbances. The few refusals only convince them that things too terrible to 
recall have indeed happened on the Gilfoy premises. Still, the first few weeks 
of their own tenancy are remarkably and disappointingly tranquil. Except for 
the faint scent of a non-existent wood fire, the house seems the ideal summer 
rental. To jazz things up, the Curtisses invite a highly recommended medium 
from Boston to visit, hoping that her presence will lure the spirit out of 
hiding. 
</P>
<P>
A charming and attractive black woman, a set designer by profession, Rosanna 
manages to elicit some action from the hitherto reluctant ghost, as well as 
rousing David's dormant sexuality. Unfortunately for the pace of the story, 
Rosanna is recalled to Boston; the empty space filled by extraordinarily 
detailed descriptions of the methodology of psychic research. The author has 
obviously done her homework, and though she carefully avoids committing herself 
to a belief in the supernatural, the reader is encouraged, if not urged, to 
open his mind and let the occult in, as some extremely eminent people always 
have. 
</P>
<P>
Matters perk up somewhat when Sally meets the delightful town librarian and 
amateur historian, Colin, an elderly gentleman who has lived in Skipton all his 
life and can lead them to sources who might otherwise not volunteer to be 
interviewed. Once Colin joins the team, the Curtisses start to make headway. He 
finds old newspaper sources recording dark days in the Gilfoy manse; diaries 
with cryptic references to the personality of the Rev. Joshua Gilfoy, and 
gradually, a picture of an anguished 19th-Century family emerges; providing 
enough tumult to permeate the material of the house and cause the ruckus 
perceived by the tenants. 
</P>
<P>
All you need do is persuade yourself that inanimate objects absorb the history 
of their owners, which is one of the prime hypotheses of parapsychology. 
Sensitive people (Hawkes is chary of the word medium) can pick up these, well, 
"vibrations," when conditions are propitious. Sally Curtiss is just such a 
sensitive person, though she's unwilling to accept either the label or its 
implications. In fact, David was first attracted to her because she performed 
so brilliantly on telepathic tests, but who wants to be loved for her Rhine 
scores alone? 
</P>
<P>
Towards the end of the book, when the experiment seems doomed by her reluctance 
to participate actively, Sally reluctantly agrees to serve as medium, and 
matters magically fall into place. To placate those who may have had trouble 
suspending their disbelief, the author supplies a scientifically plausible 
explanation for all events, but it's plain that her heart isn't in it. 
</P>
<P>
Shifting between lyrical, didactic and conversational tones, the novel seems to 
reflect the accepted definition of a medium as someone with unresolved multiple 
personalities. Sally, David, and Colin try valiantly, but "Julian's House" 
could use a character like the "Stay-Puff Marshmallow Man" to keep the story 
buoyant.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: WIFE TIRED OF PLAYING ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I have what might seem to be a happy marriage, but I'm on 
the verge of going on strike against constantly having to make all the 
decisions about where to dine, when or where to go on holiday or do anything. 
My husband refuses to take any responsibility. He does go to work, but so do I. 
Therefore, why can't it be more equal? I'm tired and I'm angry. I don't like 
the role of constant caretaker. -- S.I.H. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR S.I.H.: When one spouse changes, so will the other; it follows as night 
the day. You sound as if you're stuck in a frustrating pattern, but it doesn't 
have to go on that way and you don't have to get a divorce to find peace. In 
fact, that would probably make you both unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
Spouses who find themselves stuck in the role of caretaker have a lot of power 
and may have ambivalent feelings about losing this control. Usually, it's the 
woman who's the caretaker because women have been taught from childhood about 
her so-called nurturing role in life. She gets used to meeting the emotional 
needs of others and she frequently puts her husband's needs above her own. 
</P>
<P>
Then eventually, of course, the day comes when she rebels as you are doing now. 
I'm sure you feel cheated because of your demanding role and would like to have 
some nurturing yourself. You feel emotionally deprived. Explain all this to 
your spouse, then stop making all the decisions and stop doing all the tasks. 
Make a list of what you'll do and what he must do. Place it in a prominent 
place. And then wait and see what happens. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I have two old and cherished friendships with women and I'm 
wondering what's going to happen to these when I get married. My bride-to-be 
doesn't seem the jealous type, but my buddies tell me disastrous tales of 
what's happened in their marriages when they attempted to hold on to 
friendships like mine. Must I give up these old friends just because I'm 
married? -- J.F. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR J.F.: This is the perfect time to question this, because you have an 
opportunity to explore your fiancee's views on this before you walk down the 
aisle. Marriages are based on mutual trust, and in a good marriage, both 
spouses should be able to maintain friendships with members of the opposite 
sex. It isn't always easy, however, and much depends upon whether or not the 
husband or wife has a jealous nature. 
</P>
<P>
Many spouses and lovers feel threatened by their loved one's friendships with 
the opposite sex. The best way to prevent problems is to be as honest as 
possible about these old friendships and to try to include the spouse once in a 
while. If you can include your mate in activities with old friends, she'll feel 
less excluded and she'll be better able to understand that this is a deep 
friendship and nothing more.

TRANSMITTING AIDS

Question: Is it possible for one woman to give the virus that causes AIDS to 
another woman while having sex? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Transmission of the AIDS virus from one woman to another is very rare, 
but it has been reported. Transmission may occur as a result of the exchange of 
blood either during menses or as a result of trauma. 
</P>
<P>
For Thomas, Charlottesville, Va.: Regardless of the temperature, you should not 
work on your car in a garage with the doors closed. Carbon monoxide can do a 
lot more damage than simply causing a headache.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE / NANCY CHURNIN: THEATER SURVIVAL IN THE '90S WILL 
DEPEND ON CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Theater has been booming in San Diego for the past half-dozen years. But will 
the boom extend into the next decade, or will it bust? 
</P>
<P>
The answer, dear Brutus, is not in the stars, but in the theaters themselves, 
which must prove they are not underlings. 
</P>
<P>
It will take careful, clever, even inspired, management. 
</P>
<P>
The theaters that will survive to the year 2000 will mix conservative or 
classical fare with the new and daring. Organizations such as Sledgehammer 
Theatre can afford -- not without struggle of course -- to taunt and challenge 
audiences for a three-hour "Endgame" with no intermission because they depend 
on a modest budget where less is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
Theaters that depend on a healthy subscription base, however, need to assure 
audiences of something they know they will like, while still offering the 
risky, innovative fare that is rewarded by government grants and funding by 
independent producers. 
</P>
<P>
The subscription base will become increasingly important as money from the 
National Endowment for the Arts and other government agencies continues to 
shrink. It is from passionate and numerous subscribers that donations, 
volunteers and lobbyists for corporation, foundation and government money 
ultimately come. 
</P>
<P>
The Old Globe Theatre, San Diego's oldest, has the largest subscription base of 
any San Diego theater because it has its finger on the pulse of the city's 
tastes. That is not to say it doesn't miscalculate; the 1989 season began 
bleakly with a soulless "Blood Wedding" and went downhill with an underbaked 
"Romance, Romance" and an over-baked "Up in Saratoga." 
</P>
<P>
But the tide began to turn for the better with a stirring "Driving Miss Daisy," 
an amusing "Breaking Legs," a solid "School for Scandal" and a triumphant Maly 
State Drama Theatre production of "Brothers and Sisters." 
</P>
<P>
I predict that the theater will grow more daring in the next decade. There will 
always be Shakespeare -- but it may be less surprising to see the Globe update 
the Bard as it did so successfully with "Coriolanus," under the direction of 
the late John Hirsch. 
</P>
<P>
There will probably always be at least one world premiere (Neil Simon's "Jake's 
Women" fills that slot in March), always at least one play by a less commercial 
but important contemporary playwright (the West Coast premiere of Lee 
Blessing's "Cobb" is set for the summer), an increasing emphasis on 
cross-cultural voices (expect more August Wilson down the line and more Latino 
plays) and more international work on the scale of "Brothers and Sisters" (the 
Globe is already planning to present the sequel to the Soviet play in 1990 or 
1991). 
</P>
<P>
The financially strapped La Jolla Playhouse, a theater of adventure still 
fighting to save its 1990 season, will get a tad more conservative. 
</P>
<P>
I predict that the playhouse, which has always described itself as a national 
organization based in La Jolla, will try to dig its roots more deeply into the 
community, whose support it desperately needs. 
</P>
<P>
The playhouse has big plans, which include the building of a three-theater 
complex, incorporating the present Mandell Weiss Theatre. But can an 
organization that has alternately shocked and delighted staid San Diego 
audiences fill all those seats? 
</P>
<P>
It would be hard to imagine work by Neil Simon on the La Jolla stage, but the 
theater has proved it can fill seats with "The Grapes of Wrath" and "Macbeth" 
this year. I predict we will see more plays with name recognition to balance 
out seasons with perhaps one new play and/or musical per season. 
</P>
<P>
Like the playhouse, the San Diego Repertory Theatre must find a more 
conservative middle ground if it is to survive. The theater took its hard-won 
financial stability in the beginning of 1989 and gambled it on a risky 
premiere-laden season. 
</P>
<P>
It was exciting -- especially for the critics who love to see something new -- 
but audiences thinned out considerably between acts of "Albanian Softshoe" and 
the still-running "Animal Nation." 
</P>
<P>
I predict that the Rep, which has yet to announce its 1990 season, will woo 
back some of its subscription audience by tackling some hard-hitting 
contemporary plays with name recognition, perhaps David Mamet's 
"Speed-the-Plow" and August Wilson's "Fences," two plays under consideration 
for the coming season. 
</P>
<P>
If the Rep gets its hoped-for funding for "The Life and Life of Bumpy Johnson," 
with jazz score by Max Roach, that should be a show to catch. 
</P>
<P>
The Gaslamp Quarter Theatre's 1990 season reflects a lesson painfully learned 
from the disappointing 1989 season: The theater needs to go after top writers 
at any cost. Scantily attended shows such as "Solid Oak" and "The Melody 
Sisters" just can't pay the bills. 
</P>
<P>
Terrence McNally's "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune," Christopher 
Durang's "Laughing Wild," Alan Ayckbourn's "Woman in Mind" and Hugh Whitemore's 
"Breaking the Code" all seem like promising choices for 1990; the premiere of 
the independently produced "The Debutante," a Pygmalion story set in 
turn-of-the-century black Philadelphia society, is the wild card that may bring 
the theater the national attention and its turning point. 
</P>
<P>
Some smaller theaters will struggle while others will flourish. I predict that 
the Bowery Theatre, now assured of a stable, rent-free home at the Kingston 
Playhouse for the next three years, will continue to please with high-level 
programming. I predict that the North Coast Repertory Theatre will probably go 
Equity within the decade; but unless it invests in a development director who 
will keep it from being dependent on the box office, quality will fluctuate as 
the theater continues to live hand-to-mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller theaters without homes will find space or fade away; arrangements such 
as the one the Bowery has with the Kingston Hotel, which give it free space, 
would be beneficial for both homeless theaters and the hotels, which get free 
publicity and foot traffic from such tenants. Organizations such as the 
Progressive Stage Company and the Marquis Public Theatre may find they will 
benefit from forming partnerships with other theater groups to share space, 
ideas and financial responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
I predict that the theater with the greatest growing pains in the next decade 
will be Starlight Musical Theatre. Not only is the theater facing an identity 
crisis as it tries to work its way toward offering more contemporary musical 
fare, but it will increasingly face a crisis of venue as the plane noise from 
Lindbergh Field over the Starlight Bowl worsens. 
</P>
<P>
Putting Stephen Sondheim's "Follies" and Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Jesus Christ 
Superstar" on the summer schedule was a good idea. But will Starlight find the 
funding to develop new material? Even if the season works, it will not answer 
the question of whether Starlight will stay at the bowl, move to a new outdoor 
site or find an indoor venue for a winter season. As other theaters grow and 
blossom around Starlight, San Diego's premiere musical theater will find that 
it must evolve or go the way of the dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
But the big warning of the '80s that must be carried into the '90s is that for 
all theaters -- regardless of size, patron base or box-office sales -- 
financial failure is waiting in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Predictions for the Decade: 
</P>
<P>
* The Old Globe will grow more daring. 
</P>
<P>
* The La Jolla Playhouse, which has always described itself as a national 
organization based in La Jolla, will try to dig its roots more deeply into the 
community, whose support it needs. 
</P>
<P>
* The San Diego Rep will woo back some of its subscription audience by tackling 
hard-hitting contemporary plays with name recognition.

Producer Claims Rights to Kovic's Story: Producer Mel Goldberg has filed a 
breach-of-contract suit in Superior Court against disabled Vietnam veteran Ron 
Kovic, whose autobiography was made into the film "Born on the Fourth of July." 
Golberg contends that Kovic sold him movie rights in 1985 and then failed to 
help him make the film. 
</P>
<P>
He also alleges that Kovic avoided him to pursue the project with film maker 
Oliver Stone. "Kovic entered into the option contract so that he could take the 
$10,000 payment while he waited for Stone to renew interest in getting 
financing for a Stone-Kovic screenplay version of 'Born on the Fourth of July,' 
" the suit said. The film, starring Tom Cruise, was released last month by 
Universal Pictures. Kovic was not available for comment. DANIEL CERONE

Dietrich Honored by French: Marlene Dietrich, the legendary German-born 
actress, singer and sex symbol, has been awarded one of France's highest honors 
at age 88. In a list of 1989 distinctions published this week, she was promoted 
from the rank of Officer of the Legion d'Honneur, which she received in 1971, 
to Commander of the Legion d'Honneur, the third-highest French award. 
</P>
<P>
Now a recluse who lives in an apartment off the Champs Elysees, Dietrich for 
more than half a century epitomized glamour and sex appeal. She won fame in 
Josef von Sternberg's "The Blue Angel," featuring her husky rendition of 
"Falling in Love Again." She took American citizenship in 1937 but in the 1960s 
spoke of her feelings for Europe: "When I die, I'd like to be buried in Paris. 
But I'd also like to leave my heart in England, and in Germany -- nothing."

Anselm Kiefer Gets Israeli Prize: West German painter Anselm Kiefer has been 
awarded the $100,000 Wolf Prize in the arts. 
</P>
<P>
Kiefer will be presented the prize by Israeli President Chaim Herzog in May at 
the Knesset. In an announcement, the Israel-based Wolf Foundation said that 
Kiefer, who was born in 1945, "has created an art that synthesizes human 
history and the present condition of life in epic canvases that inspire gravity 
and awe." Kiefer first came to prominence in the 1970s with subjects that dealt 
derisively with his German heritage, particularly the Nazi period. DANIEL

STAGE BEAT: 'BEIN' WITH BEHAN' AT WEST END PLAYHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. H. McCULLOH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The three set pieces on stage at the West End Playhouse quickly place a frame 
around Michael L. Kavanagh's one-man "Bein' With Behan." A battered upright 
piano, a table with a half-empty tumbler of Guinness beside a battered 
typewriter and an old-fashioned booth partition with a bare wooden seat place 
the time (a good while ago) and the place (McDaid's Pub in Dublin). 
</P>
<P>
McDaid's is a writers' hangout and no one hung out more (or was more hung over) 
than Brendan Behan -- Irish poet, playwright, bon vivant and legendary IRA 
scrapper. His life was the stuff of romance: imprisoned at 16 for transporting 
IRA explosives to Liverpool; jailed again at home for further revolutionary 
indiscretions and released in the general amnesty of 1946; internationally 
acclaimed for his prose ("Borstal Boy") and plays ("The Quare Fellow," "The 
Hostage"), and through it all celebrating the Irish spirit as grandly as 
O'Casey and Synge. 
</P>
<P>
In the years Kavanagh has been doing this piece he has allowed Behan to inhabit 
his being. Or is it the other way round? He is discovered hunting and pecking 
at the typewriter, slugging amiable mouthfuls of stout, turning to the audience 
as though it were another patron of McDaid's approaching him. 
</P>
<P>
Kavanagh, as Behan, grabs at the opportunity. He talks about his youth as a 
house painter's apprentice, about his mother ("a peasant once removed" who 
"died regularly every week for years") and the harsh reality of the Dublin 
working class in the first half of the 20th Century ("To get something to eat 
was an achievement; to get something to drink was a complete victory"). 
Kavanagh takes us with Behan through the prison terms and skirmishes on the 
embattled streets of Ireland, through personal traumas and the beginnings of 
creative fulfillment. 
</P>
<P>
Behan is difficult to stop once he gets going -- he is a Celt, after all -- and 
only interrupts himself when the urge overcomes him to have another Guinness 
and break out with a haunting Irish melody. 
</P>
<P>
Kavanagh knows the humor of his subject, and his sadness, and his will to 
further the cause -- of both Behan and the IRA. Under Bruce Heighley's 
direction, it is a performance full of humanity and a ripe understanding of the 
skyrocket that was Behan. 
</P>
<P>
The viewer who approached Behan at the beginning feels a little lonely when the 
great man drains another glass and turns back to his typewriter. 
</P>
<P>
At 7446 Van Nuys Blvd., Van Nuys; Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 5 
p.m.; ends Feb. 4. Tickets: $15; (818) 904-0444.

'Orpheus in New Orleans' at Inglewood Playhouse 
</P>
<P>
"Orpheus in New Orleans" is an ambitious project. At the Inglewood Playhouse, 
those ambitions are barely realized. The production suffers primarily from the 
bane of musicals, a less than adequate book. 
</P>
<P>
There is a story, a modern reworking of the Orpheus legend centered around 
Mardi Gras and involving prostitution and voodoo. But the characters in Henry 
Adams' skimpy book don't rise above comic book level. They act and react on the 
most simplistic impulses. The viewer is never drawn into their problems and 
doesn't leave with much concern for their traumas. 
</P>
<P>
The score (music by Alfred Johnson and Henry Butler, lyrics by Johnson and 
Martin Kibbee) is lively, often amusing ("Good loving just don't last, but good 
cookin' do" sung by an overweight hooker) and contains a couple of affecting 
ballads ("Say You Will" and the heroine's lament "Alone"). But it doesn't have 
the size that this type of musical requires. 
</P>
<P>
The evening is almost made worthwhile by some of the performances, particularly 
Valerie Washington's Mama Roux, madam and voodoo maven; Mironda Lewis' simple 
heroine Eulalia; Arthur Burghardt's medicine-man-styled narrator, Bayou John, 
and Phillip Lewis' cool and jazzy ne'er-do-well Willy. Their vocal work is 
outstanding. But the material they have to deal with does little to keep the 
legend alive. 
</P>
<P>
In Centinela Park, off Warren Street, Inglewood; Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m.; 
Sundays, 3 p.m.; ends Jan. 28. Tickets: $10; (213) 936-7600 or (213) 281-1914.

FILM SOUND-TRACK ALBUMS AT BUDGET PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Advice: Next time you're browsing in a record store, spend some time in the 
sound-track department. 
</P>
<P>
Sound-track collections are often overlooked because they are usually isolated 
in their own department, far from the "pop-rock" section that commands the most 
consumer attention. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the best sound tracks -- both traditional film scores and the increasingly 
common collection of songs by different artists -- offer immensely appealing 
music. Added good news: an encouraging percentage of catalogue, or pre-1989, 
sound tracks are available at budget prices -- generally retailing for between 
$8 to $12. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding such pop-star vehicles as the Elvis Presley films, approximately 60 
sound track albums made the national Top 10 between 1955 and 1985. Thirty-five 
of them are now on compact disc and 19 of them are part of budget lines. 
</P>
<P>
The list includes a wide range of musical styles: "Around the World in 80 Days" 
(MCA), "The Benny Goodman Story" (MCA), "Beverly Hills Cop" (MCA), "Breakfast 
at Tiffany's" (RCA), "Bye Bye Birdie" (RCA), "Can-Can" (Capitol), "Charade" 
(RCA), "Doctor Zhivago" (MCA). 
</P>
<P>
"Exodus" (RCA), "Fame" (PolyGram), "Flashdance" (PolyGram), "Ghostbusters" 
(Arista), "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (EMI-Manhattan), "Hatari" (RCA), 
"Romeo and Juliet" (Capitol), "Saturday Night Fever" (PolyGram), "South 
Pacific" (RCA), "Staying Alive" (PolyGram) and "The Sting" (MCA). 
</P>
<P>
Beyond this, there are valuable albums that didn't make the Top 10. A small 
sampling: 
</P>
<P>
"A Clockwork Orange" (Warner Bros.) -- Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is what is 
best remembered about Stanley Kubrick's brilliantly unsettling film about 
deviant behavior, institutional and otherwise. But Beethoven accounts for only 
about 16 of the 46 musical moments here. Other elements range from the "William 
Tell" overture and "Singin' in the Rain" to original material by Wendy Carlos. 
</P>
<P>
"Less Than Zero" (Def Jam/Columbia) -- This 1987 film version of Bret Easton 
Ellis' novel about the latest lost generation was widely panned, but producer 
Rick Rubin's sound track was a noteworthy merger of pop's then-warring hard 
rock (Aerosmith, Slayer) and rap (Public Enemy, LL Cool J) factions. Also 
featured: Roy Orbison, the Bangles and Poison. 
</P>
<P>
"Midnight Express" (PolyGram) -- There are plenty of mushy moments in the music 
from this late '70s film about brutality in a Turkish prison, but the opening, 
8-minute "Chase" selection was a striking exercise in tension that made Giorgio 
Moroder's synthesizer-dominated score so influential. 
</P>
<P>
"Once Upon a Time in the West" (RCA) -- Ennio Morricone's score, with its 
jarring orchestral strains and consistently inventive subtexts, was such an 
essential part of the moody backdrop of Sergio Leone's gripping Western that 
Morricone seems an equal partner with Leone rather than his musical supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
"The Wizard of Oz" (CBS Special Products) -- You not only get the musical 
memories from one of Hollywood's most endearing films, but this 74-minute disc 
also includes the music for the "Jitterbug" scene that was cut from the film. 
</P>
<P>
BOWIE UPDATE: The first three David Bowie albums in Rykodisc's "Sound + Vision" 
series -- "Space Oddity," "The Man Who Sold the World" and "Hunky Dory" -- will 
be released Jan. 23 and will each contain at least three tracks not included on 
the original albums. The additional "Hunky Dory" selections will be "Bombers," 
a previously unreleased track recorded in 1971, as well as an alternative 
version of "The Supermen," an alternative mix of "The Bewlay Brothers" and the 
demo version of "Quicksand."

THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
Did they make you mad, son? Did they make you mean mad? Mean, mad, mean, 
mad-dog mean? 
</P>
<P>
Well, cheer up, pal, your kind of movie is being featured at the video store 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
After all that syrupy Christmas junk, it's action you want -- rough, tough, 
thrilling, no-weapons-barred action -- and CBS/Fox knows it. The company has 
just released the latest James Bond film on tape and is offering two of the 
most enjoyable secret-agent movies ever influenced by the Bond series, as well 
as a price reduction on one of the meanest, maddest tough-guy hits of last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In "Licence to Kill" ($89.98, PG-13), Bond (Timothy Dalton) sets out after the 
druglord who murdered his best friend. You'll be happy to know it's one of the 
meanest, toughest in the series. You also might enjoy the commercial that 
precedes the movie. No, really. It's another Schweppes ad featuring John 
Cleese. (The Monty Python comedian also did a funny one for the cassette 
version of his own film, "A Fish Called Wanda.") 
</P>
<P>
James Coburn was the man from Z.O.W.I.E. in a silly but largely enjoyable spoof 
of the Bond series, "Our Man Flint." The 1967 film was followed by a sequel, 
"In Like Flint," and each is now on video for $59.95. 
</P>
<P>
CBS/Fox has also repriced the tensely directed Bruce Willis hit "Die Hard" at 
$19.98, plus "Death Hunt," "Target," "Love and Bullets," "8 Million Ways to 
Die" as well as -- hey, how did these get in here? -- "The Towering Inferno" 
and "The Poseidon Adventure." 
</P>
<P>
Not enough violent action? Also new on tape is "Jakarta" (MCEG/Virgin, $79.95, 
R), a 1988 action-thriller about a CIA man who follows a mysterious woman to -- 
you guessed it -- Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's "A Chorus of Disapproval" (Southgate, $89.95, PG), a rock-'em, 
sock-'em-in-the-jaw entertainment about what happens when a bunch of street 
punks take some shots at the police glee club. OK, we lied -- it just didn't 
fit in. "Chorus" is actually a comedy about a recent widower who auditions for 
a local production of 'The Beggar's Opera' and -- yawn, 'scuse us -- gets 
involved in a real-estate scandal. See what we mean? Really, though, it's based 
on one of those great, funny, nasty Alan Ayckbourn plays. Unfortunately, it was 
directed by Michael Winner. 
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
In "Jane Fonda's Light Aerobics and Stress Reduction Program" (Warner, $29.98), 
the Queen of Fitness leads us in 20 minutes of light aerobics, 20 minutes of 
full-body stretching and 15 minutes of stress reduction. TERRY ATKINSON

RESTAURANT REVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
THE MENU VANISHES AT FRANTRECOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hardly anything we buy can vary each time as much as restaurant meals: from day 
to day, salads can be crisp or tired, meat tender or tough, service efficient 
or slow. The more ambitious the menu the more difficult it is for a restaurant 
to maintain the quality, freshness and preparation of its foods at a constant 
level. And yet consistency of quality, too often overlooked, is a significant 
concern for restaurant-goers. 
</P>
<P>
This problem has been solved by Jean-Louis Delezenne at his Frantrecote 
restaurant in Sherman Oaks. He simply simplified his menu -- to the degree that 
he did away with it entirely. Delezenne offers just one appetizer, one salad, 
one entree (though there is an alternate) and a choice of desserts. Not only 
does this formula simplify preparation and service, there's never any question 
about what to buy or what will sell -- and this efficiency can be passed on to 
the customer. 
</P>
<P>
At dinner, Frantrecote serves a prix fixe meal for a reasonable $25. It begins 
with a green salad with a tarragon-perfumed, oil-and-vinegar dressing. The main 
course is steak, a New York cut, trimmed of fat, yet tender and flavorsome 
(pre-cut like Salisbury steak), and topped with a 25-secret ingredient sauce 
that appears to consist of parsley, tarragon, rosemary, oil and other 
complementary ingredients. It works well on the beef (but less well on the 
grilled chicken breast, which can be had on request instead of steak). The 
entree comes with good, crisp, non-oily French fries and half a tomato 
Provencal topped with herbs and grilled. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the simplicity of his menu the chef doesn't have much to do during 
mealtimes. It's not surprising, then, that Delezenne's chatty greetings are a 
significant facet of his restaurant. It doesn't take much encouragement to get 
him to talk about most anything . . . except, of course, the 25 secret 
ingredients, five of which, he claims, are unknown to his father, the chef from 
whom he learned the first 20. 
</P>
<P>
Proud of being a pastry chef, Delezenne does like to talk about dessert. I 
think his best dessert is tarte tatin, which is part of the prix fixe meal. Its 
caramelized top and thin pastry bottom formed ideal boundaries for the large, 
soft pieces of apple that dominated it. 
</P>
<P>
His Paris-Brest, a multilayered affair filled with pastry cream and hazelnut 
mousse, was well-executed, but too rich for my taste. Among the desserts not 
included on the prix fixe menu, I tried a pineapple/raspberry gratin. 
Unfortunately the thin sugar float hadn't crisped sufficiently and the 
pineapple chunks seemed suspiciously as if they were from a can. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner also comes with a beverage: mineral water, soda or a glass of wine. 
Those diners interested in maintaining the reasonableness of the cost of a meal 
at Frantrecote should note that the wine list is skewed toward expensive 
bottlings. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of splurging on expensive wine, you might want to indulge in a truly 
luxurious appetizer: a light and tasty duck liver mousse with truffles or a 
rich duck foie gras. Each $12 portion is enough for two. And Delezenne's 
suggestion of accompanying it with a glass of Gewurtzraminer ($3) is a sound 
one. 
</P>
<P>
Delezenne's style of greeting his customers has undoubtedly become somewhat 
routine with time, but this young restaurateur does take the impersonality out 
of dining out. And the room is comfortable, with tables spaced well apart from 
each other. Art Deco-style light fixtures and crisp colors give the room 
warmth. 
</P>
<P>
 Frantrecote, 15466 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks. (818) 783-3007. Open for lunch 
11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Tuesday through Friday, dinner 5:30 to 10 p.m. Tuesday 
through Sunday. Beer and wine. Major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, 
food only, $50-$62.

AT THE GALLERIES / LEAH OLLMAN: IN THE ART WORLD, JANUARY BECOMES THE MIDDLE OF 
THE YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
January may signal the beginning of a fresh, untried year -- and in the present 
case, a new decade -- but in the art world, it is a month like any other. More 
auspicious on the art world's calendar is September, when the new "season" of 
shows begins and galleries settle down to business again after the summer lull. 
Allegiance to an academic calendar that begins in the fall and ends with spring 
is steadfast among New York galleries, whose clients retreat from the sweating 
city during July and August. 
</P>
<P>
The same pattern holds in San Diego, though the population here swells in the 
summer. Galleries hang the traditional summer group shows, university and 
college spaces shut down, and museums often schedule their most broadly 
appealing shows. 
</P>
<P>
However nondescript a month for those in the art biz, January is here, now, and 
it has brought with it the rooted ritual of surveying the year ahead. The view, 
of one exhibition season half-completed and the next barely planned, is 
splintered, but telling. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego galleries and museums have on their books for 1990 a globe-trotting 
schedule that glimpses at the art of Indonesia, Poland, the Soviet Union, 
Mexico and England. Good neighbors to our area artists, they also keep one foot 
on local soil, anchoring the visionary with the responsible. 
</P>
<P>
Several voids will begin to be filled in the coming year. Two shows featuring 
contemporary African-American artists ought to restore at least a temporary 
sense of egalitarianism to the local scene. One, focusing on printmakers 
nationwide, opens Saturday at the Lyceum theatre, and was organized by the 
embryonic African-American Museum of Fine Arts. The other, at Grossmont College 
(Feb. 1-23), includes local and Los Angeles artists working in a variety of 
media. 
</P>
<P>
The void left by last year's closing of Installation, the downtown alternative 
space, is also expected to be filled this year. The gallery's board of 
directors is currently running the organization out of one board member's home, 
but they have begun the search for a new director and anticipate getting back 
on track by the year's end. 
</P>
<P>
ARTWALK, the downtown art community's annual open house, coordinated by 
Installation, will take place April 21-22. Other holes in the fabric of the 
local art community may be left gaping this year. The large gallery space at 
9th and G, recently vacated by Dietrich Jenny and, before him, Mark Quint, 
awaits another brave soul willing to risk a fragile future as a contemporary 
art dealer for the sake of helping to keep downtown's art scene alive. 
</P>
<P>
New voids will also be created in 1990, as the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary 
Art closes its downtown space (this weekend) and maybe part of its La Jolla 
facility in the fall while it undergoes a major expansion. The museum is 
scouting about town for a temporary exhibition space -- or several -- in which 
to continue its programs until the expansion is completed in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
What else to expect in 1990? 
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Centro Cultural de la Raza, which 
will be publishing a book assessing its present and future endeavors. The 
gallery also plans a rich schedule of shows, from the annual eye-opening 
"Border Realities" installation by the Border Art Workshop, to a string of 
one-person and group shows featuring Native American artists, Chicano artists 
living in the Southwest and muralists from Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
Ambitious global grazing on the part of local gallery directors will yield a 
promising array of shows this year. Mark Quint Contemporary Art will feature 
work by the Polish painter and photographer Mikolaj Smoczynski as well as the 
wry assemblages of British sculptor Richard Wentworth. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet artists return to the local limelight at the David Zapf Gallery, which 
featured (along with the Mesa College Art Gallery) an engaging selection of 
paintings by Leningrad artists during last year's festival. More paintings by 
members of the Fellowship for Experimental Art will be seen at the gallery this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
German sculptor Franz Erhard Walther will present his brand of Minimalism in a 
series of abstract, dyed fabric works at the San Diego State University Art 
Gallery beginning February 9. Sculptures, murals, drawings and exuberant 
reliefs by the Basque artist Andres Nagel will be on view at the Tasende 
Gallery the following month. 
</P>
<P>
The Iturralde Gallery narrows its Latin American focus to concentrate on a 
handful of Mexican artists this year, while the Mingei International Museum of 
World Folk Art extends its gaze southward to present "Mayan Threads," a show of 
textile treasures from Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
Local artists Manny Farber, Faiya Fredman, Graciela Ovejero, Reesey Shaw, David 
Baze, Nancy Kittredge, Roy David Rogers and others will add solo shows to their 
resumes this year, and ten as-yet-undisclosed locals will also be included in 
"Satellite Intelligence: Boston/San Diego New Art Exchange," this summer at the 
La Jolla Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Double-takes and murmurs will, as always, greet Sushi's StreetSites projects 
this year. In March, the performance and visual art gallery will plant three 
temporary public art works downtown to engage the community in dialogue on such 
issues as local growth and development, homelessness and censorship of the 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
Also bound to raise a few eyebrows is photographer Robert Mapplethorpe's "X" 
portfolio, to be shown at PhotoWest Gallery this spring. Homoerotic and 
sadomasochistic images from the series were at the heart of the recent 
congressional debate over government funding of the arts. 
</P>
<P>
Two dwellings will be temporarily constructed in town this year -- one a 
shelter for the body, the other a refuge for the spirit. The San Diego Museum 
of Art presents "In the Realm of Ideas" this summer, featuring the work of 
architect Frank Lloyd Wright. As part of the exhibition, a full-scale "Usonian 
Automatic House," Wright's proposed solution to the need for moderate, 
custom-built housing, will be erected in the parking lot in front of the 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
On a more intimate scale, Los Angeles artist Mineko Grimmer will create a 
site-specific installation for the Mesa College Art Gallery in May. Grimmer's 
organic sculptures pay homage to the musical theories of John Cage as well as 
to the Japanese reverence for the integrity, meditative potential and 
metaphoric possibilities of stone. Perhaps the most subtle of the year's 
offerings, Grimmer's work will seal the current season of shows and usher in 
the calm interlude before the next begins.

PREVIEW: ACAPELLA ALL-STARS FIND HARMONY IN THEIR MUSIC AND THEIR CAREERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<P>
"We love singing harmonies, we love performing and we love audience 
participation," says Dexter Dickerson of the Acapella All-Stars. "We'll say, 
'To show you how easy it is to sing a cappella, we're bringing some of you up 
on stage.' It ends up like a big party, and it's usually pretty comical." 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson and fellow All-Stars Derick McGloughlin and Charles Lovett, all San 
Fernando Valley residents, will bring their brand of feel-good doo-wop to 
California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks at 8 p.m. Wednesday. Their 
appearance is a departure from the school's customary musical fare. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually we might have chamber music or piano or choirs," said Ron Kragthorpe, 
dean for student affairs who booked the a cappella group. "But in January it's 
a different deal. A lot of people go on travel courses and some students come 
in from other campuses. So we have lighter entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
The All-Stars have been making a name for themselves lately, climbing the 
ladder from restaurant and private party appearances to nightclub bookings, 
including sets at the eclectic and popular King King Club in Hollywood. At 
times they appear with instrumental backup as part of the eight-member King 
Cotton and the Cool Cats. That group, along with the All-Stars, has a song in 
the Paul Newman movie, "Blaze," although actors appear in the film and 
lip-synch the words. 
</P>
<P>
The All-Stars have also been recording with Rick Vito, guitarist with Fleetwood 
Mac, and hope to have an album soon. They are considering a name change to the 
Metropolitans for their record debut. 
</P>
<P>
"Rick's produced five songs with us," said Dickerson, who learned his doo-wop 
on the streets of Patterson, N.J. "They have a background that's a touch of 
doo-wop harmony, but it's a contemporary sound." 
</P>
<P>
The All-Stars are working to become more than an oldies act. However, rich 
renderings of '50s tunes are the foundation of this trio that once backed Bo 
Diddley. The group and their a cappella oldies are regular Sunday brunch 
entertainment at the Rose City Diner in Pasadena, which is where Vito 
discovered them. It was through Vito that the group got its manager, Norman 
Harris, owner of Norman's Rare Guitars in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife knows I love '50s music: doo-wop and a cappella singing," Harris said, 
"and Rick told her she should hire them for a surprise party she was giving me. 
I came into that party and they walked down a staircase singing and it blew me 
away. It's a gorgeous, complex sound." 
</P>
<P>
 The Acapella All-Stars; 8 p.m. Wednesday; Preus-Brandt Forum, California 
Lutheran University; 60 West Olsen Road, Thousand Oaks; free to students with 
Cal Lutheran or Moorpark College identification, others $5; for information 
telephone 805-493-3151.

VIETNAMESE PRISONERS TO BE REUNITED WITH RELATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON and THUAN LE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
Nearly 15 years after the fall of Saigon, American relatives of 300 former 
Vietnamese political prisoners waited anxiously Thursday for two planes to 
depart Ho Chi Minh City for Bangkok -- the first leg of a journey that will 
bring more than half of the emigres to California. 
</P>
<P>
The former prisoners aboard the flights include high-ranking former South 
Vietnamese miliary officers, bureaucrats and soldiers who spent years in 
"re-education" camps. Many complained of political persecution even after their 
release. 
</P>
<P>
Details were sketchy Thursday, but Southern California refugee resettlement 
officials confirmed that at least 70 people were headed for Los Angeles County 
and at least 63 are planning to join relatives who have settled in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department spokesman in Bangkok said the first emigres could begin to 
arrive in the United States Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
They are the first political detainees to leave with their families under an 
accord reached between Washington and Hanoi last July, after seven years of 
negotiations, Robert Funseth, senior deputy assistant secretary of state, said 
in an interview from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"The day is finally here when I will see my brother again after more than 14 
years," said Kim-Nhung Tran, 47, whose brother spent eight years in prison 
camps in northern Vietnam. When she heard the news, she said, "I couldn't sleep 
that night. I was full of plans for my brother and his new life." 
</P>
<P>
Quang-Hoi Tran, 43, a former army colonel, his wife and his two children were 
expected to be aboard the first Air Vietnam flight, scheduled to arrive in 
Bangkok Thursday night Pacific Standard Time, his sister said. 
</P>
<P>
She said her husband, son and a second brother drowned in an attempted escape 
from Vietnam in 1980. Undaunted, she fled by boat five months later, landed in 
a Thai refugee camp, and now runs a dressmaking shop in Westminster. But a 
third brother, who also spent seven years in prison camp, is still in Ho Chi 
Minh City hoping to be one of the next to depart, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Lien Dao, 65, who works for the Los Angeles County Department of Social 
Services, said her youngest brother, Hung Anh Dao, 48, once an army major, his 
wife and three children are expected to arrive at Los Angeles airport within 10 
days. 
</P>
<P>
He was captured one week after the fall of Saigon in 1975 and imprisoned near 
Ho Chi Minh City until 1980, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"During the first two years in prison, they beat him all the time," said Dao, 
who communicated with her brother by mail over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"He had almost no clothes to wear and very little food," she said. "Each day, 
they gave him two or three spoonfuls of rice sprinkled with salt. But no meat, 
no fish, nothing else at all." 
</P>
<P>
"After three years in prison, his wife was allowed to visit him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
After his release in 1980, Dao said, "He could not have a job and he dared not 
go outside because people watched him. His wife supported the family with a 
black market business selling everything, like medication and clothes," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dao, who has been trying to get her brother out of Vietnam for 10 years, said 
her mother "dreamed of coming to the United States with her son. Unfortunately, 
she died in 1986." 
</P>
<P>
"He finished four years of college in French and is very good in mathematics," 
she said. "Maybe he can learn a job in computers." 
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 former prisoners and their families have applied to the U.S. 
Embassy in Bangkok for permission to emigrate, Funseth said Thursday. He said 
the United States expects 700 people to depart Vietnam this month, and up to 
7,000 to be resettled here by September. 
</P>
<P>
Resettlement officials have said new arrivals tend to be highly educated and 
skilled, and will be better able to make their way in America than the average 
refugee. 
</P>
<P>
But they have expressed concern that federal money for refugee services, 
already in short supply because of the influx of "boat people," will not be 
sufficient to deal with emotional and medical scars of the former prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Others in the Vietnamese emigre community worried that if the former prisoners 
are too outspoken about their experiences in Vietnam's prisons, they may 
jeopardize the release of those still hoping to get out. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them probably will come forward and tell the world their personal 
stories," said Nguyen T. Nguyen, consultant to the California Legislature's 
Joint Committee on Refugee Resettlement, International Migration and 
Cooperative Development. "However, they need to be concerned about the fate of 
those left behind. Bad publicity certainly will have an adverse effect on their 
comrades." 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has made sporadic attempts at liberalization. In December, however, 
police arrested about 10,000 people in what the government said was an 
anti-crime campaign, but what dissidents branded a political crackdown, said 
Nguyen Manh Hung, director of the Indochina Institute at George Mason 
University in Fairfax, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Thu D. Duong, a former colonel and political detainee who joined his family in 
San Clemente a month ago, said that 522 former military officers who had been 
released from re-education camps were among those re-arrested in the crackdown. 
But U.S. officials could not confirm that report Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The crackdown comes amid growing tension in Vietnam over the democratization in 
Eastern Europe, Hung said. The Vietnamese government supported the now-ousted 
regimes in Poland and East Germany against the democratic protesters, and in 
the last two weeks has shut down outspoken newspapers at home. 
</P>
<P>
Duong expressed fears that any further political instability -- internal or 
external -- could jeopardize future releases in spite of the July accord. 
</P>
<P>
"We have waited for so long, and our situation is becoming more dangerous," 
said Duong, 59, who spent five years in the camps and was rearrested three 
times for trying to flee. "Because of the positions we held in the former 
regime, we are the first ones to be persecuted if there are any changes in the 
present political system." 
</P>

Civil rights activists in Selma, Ala., suspended a classroom boycott by black 
students until Jan. 16, after final exams, and announced plans to sue the 
majority white board that ousted the city's first black school superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
One picket was arrested on the second day of the boycott, and the absentee rate 
dropped from 25% to 15%. Protest leader Hank Sanders said he would file suit 
challenging the act creating Selma's school board. Supt. Norward Roussell's 
contract was not renewed after an evaluation by board members accused him of 
being dictatorial and intimidating teachers. Roussell has called the evaluation 
unfair but opposes the boycott.

City health officials began screening employees and hundreds of people served 
by a homeless shelter and soup kitchen in Stamford, Conn., after two men who 
used the facilities were hospitalized with Legionnaires' disease. 
</P>
<P>
City Health Director Andrew McBride said it was not known exactly how many 
people had stayed at the shelter or eaten at the soup kitchen in recent weeks. 
The two, a 60-year-old man and a 20-year-old man, were hospitalized before 
Christmas. Legionnaires' disease can be fatal if not treated. The health 
director and Mayor Thom Serrani ordered the building that houses the city's 
largest shelter and soup kitchen closed indefinitely for fear it was the source 
of bacteria that caused the outbreak.

First Lady Barbara Bush underwent her second of 10 radiation treatments, a 
process that doctors hope will eliminate eye problems associated with a thyroid 
condition. Mrs. Bush suffers from Graves' disease, a thyroid ailment that has 
caused bloodshot eyes and double vision. 
</P>
<P>
Two other types of treatments have not been successful and doctors hope to 
avoid surgery. The latest treatment at Walter Reed Army Medical Center involves 
bombarding her inflamed eye sockets with radiation to reduce muscle swelling. 
Anna Perez, the First Lady's press secretary, said Mrs. Bush felt "just fine." 
Perez said Mrs. Bush is "not losing her eyesight" from the disease and the 
radiation has not affected her vision.

Police sought a masked gunman who made off with more than $350,000, mostly in 
checks, during a robbery at Children's Hospital in San Diego. No shots were 
fired and there were no injuries during the holdup of a hospital financial 
officer and two unarmed security guards, police spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The three were transferring the day's receipts to a main office of the hospital 
when the gunman sprang from nearby bushes and ordered them to turn over the 
money bag. The robber then commandeered the hospital pickup truck the three had 
driven from a nearby administrative office to the main office and fled. 
Robinson said the truck was found abandoned a short time later about a block 
away from the hospital. A nylon stocking mask was found inside the cab. 
Detectives were processing the truck for fingerprints and other possible 
evidence. The stolen money included only about $5,000 in cash, Robinson said.

California's Fish and Game officials fail to protect the state's wildlife 
adequately, mismanage their regional offices and cannot deal effectively with 
other state agencies, according to the governmental watchdog agency. The Little 
Hoover Commission, a constitutionally authorized advisory body, said in a 
report to the state Legislature that state wildlife policy is crippled by the 
perception that "the Fish and Game Commission and the Department of Fish and 
Game have isolated themselves from the major groups concerned with the 
preservation of fish, game and habitat, while at the same time frequently 
straining relations with other government agencies, sporting groups and 
developers."

A state water quality agency has ordered officials at the U.S. Marine Corps 
Logistics Base near Barstow to clean up a military landfill where barrels of 
hazardous sandblasting waste are buried. Base spokesmen acknowledge that 
55-gallon drums of the waste routinely were dumped at the landfill, perhaps as 
early as 1961. 
</P>
<P>
But the Marines say they did not know the material contained dangerous levels 
of lead and other heavy metals, thus requiring its disposal at a hazardous 
waste landfill. The order issued by the California Regional Water Quality 
Control Board calls the waste a threat to the area's aquifer, the sole drinking 
water source for several desert communities. It requires base officials to 
complete the clean-up by March, 1991, or face legal action.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL TO ADVISE REINER ON CHILD SUPPORT ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner has established a panel to advise him 
on ways to improve child support collections from "delinquent dads," attorney 
Gloria Allred announced Thursday after meeting with Reiner for an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The panel will include Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Greg Thompson and other members 
of the office along with Allred and members of the Women's Equal Rights Legal 
Defense and Education Fund, an activist group. Allred said Reiner was receptive 
to other ideas she presented, including airing on local cable television 
stations the names and last known addresses of parents who have failed to pay 
child support. 
</P>
<P>
Allred, who was evicted from Reiner's outer office several years ago after he 
refused to discuss the issue with her, said she did not promise to support 
Reiner in his announced bid for state attorney general this year in return for 
establishing the child support panel.

The tiny Balkan nation, under Communist rule since 1944, has so far remained

TRANSIENT DIED AT HANDS OF POLICE, PATHOLOGIST SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
FORENSICS: THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SOUGHT A SECOND MEDICAL OPINION IN A CASE 
AGAINST TWO LAPD OFFICERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A transient arrested for throwing bottles in MacArthur Park died at the hands 
of police, according to a forensic pathologist consulted by the Los Angeles 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
"My opinion is that but for what happened during his arrest, he would not have 
died at that time," said the pathologist, Dr. Irving Root of the San Bernardino 
County coroner's office. "He had a pre-existing subdural hematoma (bleeding 
beneath the skull) which re-bled during this series of episodes." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses, who included two paramedics and a firefighter, said the man appeared 
normal before the altercation with police. They said two officers beat and 
kicked him, shoved him against a wall, allowed him to fall face down on the 
pavement after handcuffing him and stuffed him head first into a shopping cart. 
</P>
<P>
They did not call for medical aid until after taking him to the Rampart 
Division police station, where they noticed that he was no longer breathing. 
The same paramedics who had witnessed the incident were summoned to try to 
resuscitate him. 
</P>
<P>
County pathologists initially concluded that the death was accidental. But the 
district attorney's office took the unusual step of asking for a second medical 
opinion, with the concurrence of the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Root's findings, however, were not included in papers filed in Los Angeles 
Municipal Court last week, when two officers were charged with use of excessive 
force in the death of Raymond Diaz Triana on Jan. 1, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, prosecutors filed only the Los Angeles County medical examiner's 
report, which listed the cause of death as "acute subdural hematoma," but noted 
that microscopic examination indicated that the injury was not fresh. The 
county report ruled that death was "accidental," resulting from an earlier 
"probable fall." 
</P>
<P>
Microscopic specimens taken from Triana's head were examined by Dr. Hideo H. 
Itabashi, a neuropathologist in the L.A. County coroner's office, who confirmed 
the initial findings submitted by Deputy Medical Examiner Solomon L. Riley Jr. 
Riley also discussed the case with two other doctors, according to medical 
records. 
</P>
<P>
The officers, Stephen Geon and Jose Salazar, face both Police Department 
disciplinary action and up to three years in prison and/or a fine of $10,000 if 
convicted of using excessive force. If they had been charged with involuntary 
manslaughter, they could have received a maximum sentence of four years. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's decision to file the lesser charge has raised questions 
about whether weight was given to the fact that the victim was a transient. 
</P>
<P>
"In cases of police brutality we've been involved with, it's been very, very 
hard to get any disciplinary action taken against the officers involved," said 
Nancy Mintie of the Inner City Law Center. "When problems arise, they (the 
homeless and transients) do not seem to be dealt with in a manner that is 
fair-handed." 
</P>
<P>
However, she added, "I wouldn't want to make a blanket condemnation, because 
some police are very good at working with the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Gunson, head of the district attorney's special investigations division, 
has refused to discuss his reasons for not filing stronger charges against the 
officers. But district attorney spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said that in light of 
the conflicting medical opinions, a manslaughter charge would not meet the test 
of "probable cause" required to survive a preliminary hearing, nor would the 
evidence support a manslaughter conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"We went with what we felt was the strongest case we had," Gibbons said. The 
one-year statute of limitations on the excessive-force charge was also running 
out, so prosecutors had to file charges before getting a third medical opinion, 
she noted. 
</P>
<P>
Geon and Salazar are scheduled for arraignment Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
They surrendered earlier this week and were released on their own recognizance.

A Greek-Orthodox priest, who had hidden the fact that he is a convicted child 
molester from officials of a Hermosa Beach church where he counseled 
teen-agers, has been arrested for allegedly trying to sexually molest a young 
man, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Adamakis, 47, a volunteer at St. Cross Episcopal Church, who was known 
to church teen-agers as "Father Stan," turned himself in last week after the 
alleged victim, an 18-year-old man, and his mother reported the incident, 
Hermosa Beach police said. 
</P>
<P>
Reached Thursday at his home in Northridge, Adamakis refused comment. He is 
free on $17,500 bond pending arraignment Jan. 23 in Torrance Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Adamakis has not worked as a priest for at least 15 years and faces being 
defrocked for alleged "sexual misbehavior," an official of the Western Diocese 
of the Greek Orthodox Church said. 
</P>
<P>
Adamakis is employed as an administrator of a suicide prevention program for 
Family Services of Los Angeles, a private nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
Although detectives described the alleged sexual incident as "your basic child 
molestation case," the arrest has revived long-simmering, ill-will in the beach 
community toward the landmark church. 
</P>
<P>
In the last four years, St. Cross has struggled to rebound from testimony in 
the 1985 preliminary hearing in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case that 
children from the Manhattan Beach school were molested and forced to witness 
satanic rituals in the church. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a sad and difficult experience and it couldn't have come at a worse 
time," the Rev. Jack Eales of St. Cross said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite vigilance in the South Bay about child molestation because of the 
McMartin case, Eales said it "never crossed anyone's mind" to screen the scores 
of volunteers who help at the church. 
</P>
<P>
"We just never checked," Eales said. "There never seemed a reason to. I suspect 
it's just in our nature, being a church, to reach out to people and be 
basically trusting." 
</P>
<P>
The church has now decided to screen volunteers as well as church employees, 
Eales said. 
</P>
<P>
Only after Adamakis was arrested did Eales learn that he is serving five years' 
probation after being sentenced to 78 days in jail for fondling two adolescent 
brothers in Torrance in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Since Adamakis' arrest, several other youths have reported that he tried to 
seduce them, said Hermosa Beach Police Detective Tom Bohlin. None of the youths 
came forward earlier, either because they were embarrassed or felt that 
Adamakis was harmless, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations that led to the arrest were made on the afternoon of Dec. 17, 
when the alleged victim and his mother went to police, Bohlin said. The 
teen-ager, who lives in Rancho Palos Verdes, told detectives that he had gone 
to a home on The Strand in Hermosa Beach the night before to sleep over with 
two 17-year-old friends, one of whom is a member of Adamakis' youth group, the 
detective said. 
</P>
<P>
Adamakis had been invited to chaperon the youths by the parents, who were out 
of town. 
</P>
<P>
The reasoning, the detective said, was "what's better than to have a priest 
watch your children while you're away for the weekend?" 
</P>
<P>
According to a police report, Adamakis bought beer for the youths and they got 
drunk while watching television movies. As they prepared for bed, the report 
said, Adamakis told the 18-year-old that he should remove his clothes, which 
were dirty, before he went to sleep in a clean bed. 
</P>
<P>
The teen awoke about 2:30 a.m. when the older man crawled into bed and fondled 
him, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The youth told Adamakis that he was in "big trouble." When he ran off to awaken 
his friends, Adamakis left the house, the report said.

MANNING COMPLAINS ABOUT LAG ON HIGH-RISE SPRINKLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The head of the Los Angeles Fire Department, citing a $25-million series of 
fires that roared through a Westwood neighborhood last month, complained 
Thursday that the city has been slow to reduce fire hazards in about 120 older 
high-rise residential buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the City Council, Fire Chief Donald Manning said plans to 
require the installation of sprinklers in high-rises have been discussed for 18 
months, with no resolution. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point in the process, it would be difficult for me to conceal my 
disappointment," Manning stated in the letter, which was sent to Councilman 
Richard Alatorre, chairman of the Police, Fire and Public Safety Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, dated Jan. 3, was made public Thursday at a Board of Fire 
Commissioners meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Manning asserted that the most recent version of a proposed 
sprinkler ordinance "contains exemptions . . . that are viewed by this 
department as effectively neutralizing the fire and life safety impact of the 
ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
Those exemptions would allow building owners to avoid the sprinkler 
requirements if they could show that their building contained a substantial 
amount of asbestos, according to a Fire Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos once was commonly used as insulation, but in recent years, tiny 
asbestos particles have been shown to pose health risks. As a result, residents 
of the high-rises have expressed concern that installation of sprinklers in 
asbestos-insulated buildings would cause asbestos fibers to be released into 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department decision to go public with its complaints drew a quick, 
wounded response from Alatorre's office. 
</P>
<P>
"We're stunned, shocked and disappointed," said Bonnie Rath, who works on the 
public safety committee for Alatorre. 
</P>
<P>
She said Alatorre had been working with the Fire Department to resolve the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
"At no point did we attempt to undercut them," Rath said. "Releasing this to 
the press undercuts us." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1974, according to city ordinance, any buildings more than 75 feet high 
must have sprinklers. Owners of older commercial high-rises already have been 
required to retrofit their structures. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said there are still 120 older condominiums, apartment houses 
and hotels not covered by city ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in July, 1988, discussions aimed at writing an ordinance to cover 
these buildings began with the Fire Department, the Department of Building and 
Safety, and Alatorre. 
</P>
<P>
Rath said the sprinkler ordinance is scheduled to come up for debate Monday. 
One Fire Department source said the department is hopeful it will still be 
successful in modifying the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rath, Alatorre is trying to balance fire safety against the 
dangers of exposing people to asbestos or forcing them to vacate apartments for 
months at a time while sprinklers are installed. But fire officials said the 
asbestos issue has been blown out of proportion, and that sprinklers can be 
installed without forcing people out of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Drummond, the department's deputy chief for operations, estimated that 
the 14-story Wilshire Terrace condominium project that caught fire on Dec. 23 
would have suffered only one-tenth of the damage it sustained if sprinklers had 
been installed on each floor. The Wilshire Terrace cooperative the year before 
had discussed the possibility of installing a $1-million sprinkler system, but 
no action was taken. 
</P>
<P>
The building caught fire around 3:30 a.m., ignited by an explosive blaze at a 
construction project next door. The flames engulfed the entire east side of the 
building, destroying 22 of the apartments. Nearly 150 people were evacuated. 
There were no deaths or serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Federal and local arson experts have conducted what one firefighter 
characterized as a "foot-by-foot" inspection of the construction site and sent 
off pieces of evidence for laboratory analysis. But fire officials said 
Thursday that they still did not know what caused the initial blaze.

BASKETBALL STAR BLACKMON, HOME ON A VISIT FROM JAPAN, DISCOVERS THAT 
READJUSTING IS HARD TO DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A husky Anthony Blackmon looked a bit out of place sitting on the bench at Cal 
State Dominguez Hills wearing a dark, customed-tailored Oriental suit. 
</P>
<P>
The last time he was there the 6-foot-7 center wore a cardinal and gold Toro 
basketball uniform on a medium frame, scored 20 points and grabbed 10 rebounds 
a game en route to being named California Collegiate Athletic Assn. Athlete of 
the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Currently playing professionally in Japan, Blackmon made his first visit to the 
United States in December and realized quickly that he had changed, and so had 
things in Carson. He found it difficult to put his finger on it, he said, but 
he just felt that things were different. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just trying to get used to this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon is not the first Toro to land a job in international basketball, but 
he is, perhaps, the most celebrated. He was a four-year starter, playing in 
more games than anyone else in the school's history. He also finished as the 
school's leading rebounder and shot blocker and was second in scoring to 
William Alexander, who went on to professional careers in Chile and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Until Coach Dave Yanai discovered him in a high school all-star game, Blackmon 
wasn't thinking of playing basketball in college, if he got there at all. He 
grew up in the Aliso Village projects near downtown Los Angeles, a rough 
neighborhood that even the good-natured Blackmon thought might consume him with 
its vice. 
</P>
<P>
But Blackmon, with help from Yanai, survived the ghetto and now he is living in 
Kawasaki, a suburb of Tokyo, where he plays for the Toshiba Co. team. 
</P>
<P>
Still, pointed out Blackmon, what a difference a year makes. Toshiba is off to 
a lackluster 3-7 start. A year ago he led the Toros to a 20-10 record and a 
berth in the NCAA Division II Western Regionals. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills, which starts three freshmen, has struggled to a 4-8 
record this season. It shows little sign of improvement in its front line. 
Blackmon averaged about 38 minutes of playing time last year while dominating 
the post area. 
</P>
<P>
"He is used to winning," Yanai said. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon has handled the transition to a different culture very well, Yanai 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"As a person he is a lot stronger. He has confidence and conviction in what he 
wants to do. He's grown up. That's certainly the way to put it." 
</P>
<P>
He has grown in other ways, too. Blackmon's weight has ballooned to more than 
230 pounds from 215. 
</P>
<P>
"They have some especially good eatin' over there," he said of Japanese 
cuisine, which apparently has caught his fancy. As a fringe benefit of his 
estimated salary of $125,000 a year, his employer furnishes a chef in his 
motel-style dormitory room. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Blackmon's weight gain, he pointed out, has taken place in his upper 
torso. The time he used to spend on class work he now uses for weightlifting 
and cross-country running. In holiday workouts with the Toros, Blackmon's extra 
strength showed. 
</P>
<P>
"He's big and strong," Yanai said. "The minute he steps on the floor he is 
assertive. He takes command." 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon, a black who attended L.A. Wilson High School, is living away from 
home for the first time. He was warned that Japanese culture tends to be very 
exclusive of gaijins (outsiders). 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new experience for me," Blackmon said. "But it was a chance to get away 
and learn new things." 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon says he has learned "a skosh more Japanese," yet at times the language 
barrier has gotten in the way. 
</P>
<P>
"The disadvantage is that I don't speak the language and so I don't know what 
is being said in practice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yanai told him to utilize international language of basketball to fill the 
communication void: "A pat on the back." 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon scored a career-high 49 points in one of his first games in Japan, but 
until the last five games, he was not starting consistently. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been averaging about 18 minutes of playing time a game," he said. Another 
American, veteran international player Danny Davis, 30, has been playing in 
front of Blackmon. 
</P>
<P>
However, Yanai said he has spoken to club officials in Japan several times and 
"(Blackmon) is very well liked. He has been well-received. There have been no 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon said there is a big difference in the caliber of basketball in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese basketball is very different. It is very slow," Blackmon said. "When 
I first got there it was difficult for me. I know what speed I can go. The 
Japanese game is slower, so I had to adapt." 
</P>
<P>
He has been frustrated by the attitude of some of his teammates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wish the Japanese players would play a bit more with their hearts," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Yanai: "He went over there with the opportunity to help them have a good 
team, and I think he feels the burden and responsibility (to lead the team)." 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon said he has lots of room for improvement in his play. Yanai says his 
former pupil used his visit here to get "refocused" on what his role should be 
in Japan. His team plays five more games, and if it goes 3-2 it will probably 
qualify for the area playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him that nothing should keep him from playing as good and hard as he 
did here," Yanai said. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon said he realized that such an effort could benefit him later this 
year. He plans to return to the United States in the spring with the intent of 
playing in the Summer Pro League at Loyola Marymount. He says he will also work 
out daily at Cal State Dominguez Hills, where he hopes to take classes toward 
his college degree. He says he wants to complete his degree over the next two 
and a half years by attending school part time. According to NCAA statistics, 
less than a third of all college athletes graduate within four years. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon hopes his experience in Japan can help him impress National Basketball 
Assn. scouts this summer, perhaps landing a tryout in a rookie camp. 
</P>
<P>
"I know my game is a lot better than what they have (in Japan)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Will he return to the Far East if he fails to register NBA interest? 
</P>
<P>
"We start talking about (my contract for next year) in January," he said. "I 
just want to play with Americans that (play like) they want to win." 
</P>
<P>
Said Yanai about Blackmon moving on to another professional arena: "Those 
possibilities are avenues (he may be able to) take." 
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the Toro gymnasium, Blackmon was reminded by an interviewer 
who had followed his career: "Nothing stays the same." 
</P>
<P>
The big guy shrugged the shoulders of his pin-striped suit and reluctantly 
agreed.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: XAVIER COACH CALLS THE LIONS THE BEST LOYOLA TEAM COACH 
PAUL WESTHEAD HAS EVER HAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
What is one to make of the Loyola Marymount basketball program? Has Paul 
Westhead created a monster? 
</P>
<P>
These no longer are the unknown little Lions who sneak into town and escape 
with an upset. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions started their Eastern road trip ranked 25th in the Associated Press 
and USA Today polls. 
</P>
<P>
Xavier's last-second 115-113 victory in Cincinnati had an atmosphere more 
fitting a game in March or a matchup with a traditional bitter rival. The 
Musketeers' game-winning shot precipitated a mass of Xavier students rushing on 
the court to mob the victors. 
</P>
<P>
And only moments after burying the Lions, the Xavier folks couldn't wait to 
praise them. 
</P>
<P>
"We doubted ourselves coming into the game because of the hoopla following 
Loyola," said Xavier Coach Pete Gillen -- a man whose team has lost only four 
home games in four-plus seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best team Paul has had (at Loyola). That's certainly a Top 20 
team. If there are 20 better teams in the country on a neutral court, I want to 
see them." 
</P>
<P>
Even in defeat, Loyola made converts in Ohio. One Xavier fan, while filing out, 
shook his head admiringly and noted: "Give (Loyola) a 6-foot-9, 240-pound 
center and they'd win the national title." 
</P>
<P>
The security guard outside Loyola's locker room pointed to the scoreboard and 
said: "It doesn't get any better than that. That was better than the pros." 
</P>
<P>
People who don't regularly see the Lions still find it hard to believe nearly 
all of their games are like that. 
</P>
<P>
And the Lions now expect to win those games. Especially if Hank Gathers regains 
his peak form after missing two weeks and Bo Kimble continues to score nearly 
40 points a game and shoot 60% -- which he has done for close to a month. 
</P>
<P>
Gillen said: "(Kimble) is a nightmare. He looks you in the face and throws in a 
three. Gathers and Kimble are men. They're killers." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most unusual statistics in Xavier's victory over Loyola Tuesday was 
that the Lions were out-assisted, 25-15, partly because Xavier made six more 
field goals. It's rare when an opponent tops the Lions in both, and the assist 
advantage wasn't lost on Xavier. 
</P>
<P>
"The big key to controlling (Loyola) is to control their point guard," Gillen 
said. Lions starting point guard Tony Walker fouled out with only four points 
and five assists -- he averages eight -- while backup Terrell Lowery had seven 
assists but only 10 points, six below his norm. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though Gathers and Kimble are their marquee players, I've always felt the 
key to beating them is to slow down their point guard," Gillen said. "Walker 
and Lowery are fast, and if you let them push it downcourt and get the ball to 
Gathers and Kimble and (Jeff) Fryer for open shots they'll kill you. (Xavier's 
Jamie) Gladden did a pretty good job controlling their point guard. They're a 
very difficult team to play." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's game was played in an appropriate facility -- venerable Cincinnati 
Gardens, the old stomping ground of Oscar Robertson and other NBA stars. 
Tuesday's matchup could have been mistaken for a convention of National 
Basketball Assn. scouts. 
</P>
<P>
An entire row of pro scouts was on hand to view Loyola seniors Gathers, Kimble 
and Fryer and Xavier big men Tyrone Hill and Derek Strong. Representatives of 
at least 16 teams were present, ranging from old NBA hands like Detroit's Dick 
McCloskey and New York's Dick McGuire to former players Mel Daniels and Ronnie 
Lester of the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most impressive performances was Kimble's 38 points with 7-for-7 
accuracy from three-point range. The Pistons' McCloskey was ready to draft him 
on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't let the (scouts) distract me," Kimble claimed. "Hopefully I impress 
'em (but) I'm not gonna alter my game to impress them. My main concern is 
winning games. It's more important to win than to score. If we keep winning 
they have to notice us." 
</P>
<P>
There figure to be more scouts watching Saturday when the Lions play LaSalle 
here (5 p.m. PST). The unbeaten Explorers have one of the nation's top forwards 
in Lionel (L-Train) Simmons, and Loyola's Philadelphia roots make this a 
special game. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most excited I've been -- except for Vegas -- for an opponent," 
said Kimble, a Philly native. "There's a lot of excitement for the (LaSalle) 
guys -- they know they could have their career highs against Loyola Marymount. 
This is for joking rights and bragging rights." 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, also a Philadelphia native, said: "It'll be more of a fun situation 
than a won-loss deal. But it'll be pretty good competition out there. Playing 
against the Train. We go at it." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I usually do well. Real well." 
</P>
<P>
Triple Play: It used to be a big deal for a college basketball team to score 
100 points, but Loyola Marymount in Westhead's fast-break-at-all-costs program 
has made it commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
In 131 games under Westhead (of which the Lions have won 84), Loyola has been 
in triple figures 63 times. The pace picked up considerably two seasons ago 
when Westhead instituted the full-court press for the entire 40 minutes. Since 
the start of the 1987-88 season, the Lions have topped 100 points 54 times in 
73 games. They share the NCAA season record of 23 games in triple figures with 
the 1975-76 Nevada Las Vegas game. 
</P>
<P>
This season the Lions are 10 for 10 in reaching triple figures, with a low of 
104 and a high of 152. 
</P>
<P>
Extreme Challenge: Xavier saw both ends of the basketball spectrum within a 
week. In winning last week's Met Life Classic in San Francisco, the Musketeers 
played defense-minded Princeton, which tries to keep the score in the 40s. A 
week later it faced Loyola, a team that prefers the 140s. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like choosing your form of torture," Xavier's Gillen noted. "They're both 
horrible." 
</P>
<P>
College Notes: Loyola senior Kimble was named West Coast Conference basketball 
Player of the Week for the third time in four weeks and was also announced as 
the WCC Player of the Month for December. Kimble had consecutive games of 51 
and 53 points -- both school records and the highest WCC totals in a decade -- 
while averaging more than 40 points in the month . . . The Loyola women's team 
won a rare blowout Tuesday, whipping visiting Penn, 76-55. Ten Lions scored, 
with four in double figures, led by Lynn Flanagan and Joelle Longobardi at 14 
apiece. The Lions shot 49% and made 10 more field goals than the visitors . . . 
Former Loyola star Forrest McKenzie was in town last week for a Loyola game. 
The lions' career scoring leader is playing in Portugal and averaging 37 
points. He said he will try one more time to catch on in the National 
Basketball Assn . . . Another Loyola star, Corey Gaines, was signed by the 
Philadelphia 76ers to a conditional 10-day contract this week.

MORNINGSIDE, NO LONGER NATIONALLY RANKED, ROUTS NORTH TORRANCE, 79-50

<P>
Stripped of its national ranking and coming off two consecutive losses for the 
first time since 1981, the Morningside High girls basketball team set out to 
halt its fall from grace Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to regain some respect," Coach Frank Scott said. "People think we're 
easy now." 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to familiar surroundings after two disappointing weeks on the road, 
the Lady Monarchs proved they are still the class of the South Bay by routing 
North Torrance, 79-50, in an Ocean League opener at North. 
</P>
<P>
It was Morningside's 73rd consecutive league win and the first step toward an 
eighth straight league title. 
</P>
<P>
Is anyone capable of snapping the streak? 
</P>
<P>
"Not in our league," said North Assistant Coach Dan Hansen. "It just won't 
happen. The only race is going to be for second place between us, West 
(Torrance) and Centennial." 
</P>
<P>
North made a game of it for a half. The Saxons jumped to a 6-2 lead before 
falling behind, and later scored the last six points of the second quarter to 
pull within 35-27 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
But Morningside (10-3 overall) quashed any thoughts of a third consecutive loss 
by outscoring North, 24-2, in the third quarter to open a 59-29 lead. The 
Saxons, whose previous two losses came in tournament finals, fell to 9-3. 
</P>
<P>
"Lately we've been playing not to lose instead of getting into our mode of 
play," Scott said. "I think we finally realized how to pull away from this 
team." 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Monarchs did it in typical fashion, going to 6-foot-5 center Lisa 
Leslie. The senior responded with a game-high 27 points, eight rebounds and 
seven blocked shots. She scored 10 points in the decisive third quarter and 
punctuated her performance with back-to-back blocks against North's star 
center, 5-11 Laura Collins, in the fourth quarter. Collins finished with 22 
points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think (Morningside) is as good as last year," Hansen said. "But Lisa. 
What can you say? She's the best." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside opened the season as the nation's best team, earning the No. 1 
rating from USA Today. The Lady Monarchs dropped to No. 6 after their loss to 
Brea-Olinda two weeks ago in the Tournament of Champions in Santa Barbara, and 
this week they fell out of the Top 25 following back-to-back losses to Cannon 
County of Tennessee and South Pike of Magnolia, Miss., in the Best in the U.S. 
Invitational in Shelbyville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, though, isn't losing any sleep over his team being ousted from the 
national spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really concerned about that," he said. "We wanted to get back on the 
winning track today. Right now we're thinking about league games and the 
playoffs. That's what's important." 
</P>
<P>
Guards Bridget Williams and Akiba Flanagan added 11 and 10 points for 
Morningside, and 6-4 sophomore Janet Davis, still hampered by a bad ankle, 
contributed five points, five rebounds and three blocks.

The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Hyang Chon, 12921 Fern St., Stanton. (714) 891-5166. Open daily from 10 a.m. to 
11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Eel, grilled short ribs and barbecued herring are just a few items on this 
Korean restaurant's exotic and varied menu. Pan cha, colorful side dishes, are 
especially good here, with such specialties as gae jang, raw marinated crab, 
and jap chae, glass noodle with meat and vegetable. Lunchtime prices are a 
steal. 
</P>
<P>
Revere House, 900 W. 1st St., Tustin. (714) 543-9314. Open Mondays through 
Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Sundays from 10:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Revere House is one of those dark, woody dinner houses that were popular 
during the 50s and guess what: That's when the place opened. It specializes in 
credible versions of plain old American food -- prime rib, pan fried chicken, 
turkey with all the trimmings -- all churned out with dependable regularity. 
The menu is enormous and portions are Protean. All entrees come with a choice 
of Caesar or spinach salad. Desserts are the one weak spot, except for the 
tapioca pudding you get for free. 
</P>
<P>
The Hobbit, 2932 E. Chapman Ave., Orange. (714) 997-1972. Open for dinner 
Tuesdays through Sundays at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Hobbit is a special occasion restaurant, serving prie fixe dinners that are 
elaborate without being pretentious. Book well in advance. You begin the 
evening in the restaurant's wine cellar, nibbling on Julia Child-like 
appetizers, sipping champagne and chatting with total strangers. Chef Mike 
Phillippi takes it all very seriously, preparing solid food that is 
well-balanced, though rarely brilliant. Entrees like beef Wellington and 
lobster Thermidor rotate weekly. Service is performed by smiling waitresses in 
print uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Ghandi, 3820-D Plaza Drive, South Coast Plaza Village, Santa Ana. (714) 
556-7273. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 6 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandhi could be called new wave Indian: it roasts quail in its clay oven and 
pours Beaujolais nouveau as often as beer. Phlegmatic waiters in fancy tuxedoes 
perform service on the brass enclosed patio, a former pizzeria that looks more 
like Paris than Delhi. Appetizers like chicken tikka salad and the various 
tandoori dishes are refined and pleasant. Spicy dishes like lamb in spinach 
puree and curried eggplant are even better. Expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Grappa, 2304 W. Ocean Front, Newport Beach. (714) 675-1930. Open Tuesdays 
through Thursdays from 6 to 10 p.m., Fridays through Sundays till 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Grappa, housed in what used to be Zeppa, is yet another beachfront Italian 
restaurant in Newport. New owner Vincenzo Gentile hasn't changed the basic 
concept: The restaurant still resembles a Florentine villa, with a kitchen that 
churns out such favorites as great fried calamari, salads with lots of balsamic 
vinegar, and upscale pastas such as agnolotti and penne. Nodino alla griglia, 
an excellent veal chop grilled with aromatic herbs, is a standout. Desserts are 
intelligently underindulgent. 
</P>
<P>
laces Afar, 25932 Muirlands Blvd., Mission Viejo. (714) 581-4200. Open daily 
except Tuesdays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
Calesa, 2106 Tustin Ave., Santa Ana. (714) 541-6585. Open daily except Sundays 
from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
Places Afar is your basic Cuban-French-Vietnamese restaurant; the English is 
circumspect, the cooking is spectacular. Start with Cuban ham croquettes 
alongside greaseless plantain chips, or a bowlful of smoky black bean soup. 
Then try Imperial salad from Vietnam. Evenings, there are such French classics 
as couscous and choucroute. Calesa has a sign boasting "Round-the-World-Dining" 
-- it's a luxurious restaurant with Filipino, Asian and Continental 
specialties. There is a wide selection of main dishes from paella to sate, and 
cooking is often on the sweet side. Service is formal, and waiters in tuxedos 
flame desserts with enthusiasm that borders on lust. 
</P>
<P>
Faraday's Grill and Spirits, 13102 Newport Ave., Tustin (714) 730-3442. Open 
Sundays through Thursdays from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 11 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Faraday's is a family restaurant with cheerful service, juicy burgers and some 
mighty devoted fans. Why else would anyone wait half an hour for institutional 
food on a Tuesday evening? Everybody goes ape over onion strings, mountains of 
flour dredged onions deep fried until crispy, and the sappy sweet barbecue that 
kids favor so shamelessly. Breakfast is actually quite credible here, with 
fluffy pancakes, homemade muffins, and squeezed-to-order OJ. Portions are 
predictably generous and prices are modest. 
</P>
<P>
Baci, 18478 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. (714) 965-1194. Open Wednesdays 
through Sundays from 5:30 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Baci is just a storefront restaurant with modest decor, but young New Yorker 
Angelo Parisi gives his food a rough sophistication; nearly all his dishes are 
touched with originality. All of Italy finds its way onto Parisi's small menu. 
Complimentary appetizers might be a superbly light chicken minestrone or some 
cold garlic-infused broccoli. Dishes such as fettuccine agnello, flat noodles 
with stewed lamb, and linguine tuttomare, with scungilli and shrimp, sustain 
the enthusiasm. The best dessert is panna cotta, the poor man's creme brulee. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings, in the Anaheim Hilton and Towers, 777 Convention Way, Anaheim. (714) 
750-4321. Open Fridays through Tuesdays from 6 to 11 p.m. Call for lunch times. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings has good food for a hotel restaurant but other aspects of dining there 
can be annoying; service is particularly spotty and indifferent. The room is 
predictably clubby with the predictable hotel creature comforts. The menu 
features a sumptuous lobster ravioli appetizer, a fine seafood Caesar salad, 
and some highly credible entrees, among them filet mignon that melts in the 
mouth and a great veal. Seafoods are done handsomely. The wine list is 
extensive and intelligent. 
</P>
<P>
Hassan's Cafe, 3325 Newport Blvd., Newport Beach. (714) 675-4668. Open Tuesdays 
through Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5:30 to 11, Sundays from 5:30 to 
11 only. 
</P>
<P>
 Hassan's Cafe specializes in the cuisine of Lebanon -- a hybrid of Turkish, 
French, and local influences -- and the restaurant is relaxing and exotic. 
Mazza, one of the world's great noshes, is the absolute must here, a splendid 
array of Middle Eastern appetizers such as mutebel, a smoky eggplant dip, and 
warrab ennaq, vine leaves stuffed with aromatic rice. There are interesting 
main dishes such as kibbe nayya, raw ground lamb mixed with bulgur wheat, sort 
of an Arabic version of steak tartare. Kebabs are first-rate. 
</P>
<P>
Nui Ngu, 10528 McFadden Ave., Garden Grove. (714) 775-1108. Open Tuesdays 
through Thursdays and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 
8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Pagolac, 14564 Brookhurst St., Westminster. (714) 531-4740. Open Tuesdays 
through Sundays from noon to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Little Saigon is always an arresting place to browse when in the mood for 
adventurous inexpensive dining. Nui Ngu, in a misbegotten strip mall on 
McFadden Avenue, specializes in the wonderfully obscure cuisine of Hue, in 
Central Vietnam. Bun bo Hue, a peppery beef noodle soup, and banh bot loc, 
sticky tapioca flour dumplings, are unforgettable. At Pagolac you can 
experience a phenomenon known as bo bay mon, literally "seven courses of beef." 
The Vietnamese are mad for it. Unload a truck before you go. 
</P>
<P>
Bagatta, 3012 Newport Blvd., Newport Beach. (714) 675-4020. Open Mondays 
through Thursdays from 6 to 11 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till midnight. 
Sundays from 5 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The early returns show Bagatta to have a healthy lead in the Newport Beach 
Italian restaurant sweepstakes. It's a terrific addition to the local dining 
scene. Chef Andrea Rogantini brings heavyweight experience to the kitchen. 
Owner Tony Bagatta makes a charming host. Such dishes as salmon carpaccio, 
latticed with a moss green pesto sauce, and dry cured bresaola make spectacular 
beginnings. Pastas are beautifully textured. Desserts such as zucotto and 
homemade spumoni are other-worldly. 
</P>
<P>
Sapori, 1080 Bayside Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 644-4220. Open daily from 
11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., till 11 p.m. weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Sapori is a modish, elegant neighborhood trattoria where the cooking is 
serious. Chefs Adriano and Franco Maniacci hail from Palermo, Sicily, but play 
no favorites with regard to the many regions of Italan cuisine. Bruschetta di 
pane Saracena, triangles of roasted wheat bread with a garlic puree, are 
delightful, and many pastas come blanketed in savory sauces. Suprema di rombo, 
turbot in a leek and watercress sauce, pays homage to nouvelle. Veal Milanese 
is the best you'll find anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Kitayama, 101 Bayview Place, Newport Beach. (714) 725-0777. Open Mondays 
through Fridays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., daily from 6 p.m. to 10:30. 
</P>
<P>
Kitayama, the first really serious Japanese restaurant in Orange County, is an 
exquisite addition to the local dining scene. You'll think you've wandered into 
a Buddhist temple -- until you taste the delicate, sophisticated cooking of 
Yoshio Shirai and his team of chefs. The sho-ka-do lunch is the most beautiful 
$14 meal anywhere, and the omakase kaiseki, a multicourse feast at $50 per 
person, is unforgettable. 
</P>
<P>
Five Feet Too, in Fashion Island, 1145 Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach. 
(714) 640-5250. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
The gentrification of Chinese cuisine reaches new heights of absurdity in this 
self-consciously chic restaurant, the second effort of owner chef Michael Kang. 
The restaurant is visually stunning but often comes up short in the taste 
department: Many dishes are precious and ill-conceived. The signature 
deep-fried catfish is excellent, and some imaginative dishes work well. Curried 
beef spring rolls are delightful. Kung pao three, with chicken, scallops and 
shrimp, is too. Desserts also are fine. Pity they don't serve humble pie. 
</P>
<P>
The Towers, in the Surf and Sand Hotel, 155 S. Coast Highway, Laguna Beach. 
(714) 497-4477. Open daily for breakfast and lunch and for dinner from 5:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a task to upstage the commanding sweep of the California coastline at the 
Towers, a Laguna Beach restaurant perched atop a beachfront hotel. New 
executive chef Jackson Kenworth tries his mightiest. He came from Citrus in Los 
Angeles, and he shows his mettle in a variety of dishes. Home-cured salmon is a 
delight, served in bite-sized nubs. Sea scallops in a Citrus-like potato 
risotto are sensational. Warm short rib terrine with vegetables in a mustard 
vinaigrette is as original as they come. 
</P>
<P>
Capers, 34150 Coast Highway, Dana Point. (714) 661-3983. Open daily from 11:30 
a.m. to 2:30 p.m., 5 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Capers is a bright new seafood restaurant occupying the site of the former 
Dana Trader, and it has a beachy, casual air well suited to the location. The 
food isn't half bad when the kitchen plays it straight, but the kitchen tries 
too hard to be creative, often with disastrous results. There is a noble, 
garlicky Caesar, not for wimps, some fair broiled fish and several good shrimp 
dishes. Be wary of the ill-conceived attempts at nouvelle, especially anything 
with the horrid lime dipping sauce, coconut batter -- or capers, the 
restaurant's signature condiment. 
</P>
<P>
Ten Hu, 315 S. Magnolia Ave., Anaheim. (714) 826-9910. Open Tuesdays through 
Thursdays and Sundays 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 10. 
</P>
<P>
Ten Hu doesn't compare with Chinese restaurants in Chinatown or the San Gabriel 
Valley, but that shouldn't put you off. Just remember that the steamed fish 
might be frozen. Winter melon soup with shredded chicken is a masterwork, and 
the Sichuan shrimps are particularly fine. It's primarily a seafood restaurant, 
but you may do just as well with the non-seafood items such as the Peking 
spareribs or the mouth-watering rice noodle dishes. Stay away from the 
retro-Chinese standbys such as chop suey and egg foo young. They're awful. 
</P>
<P>
The Pleasant Peasant, 4251 Martingale Way, Newport Beach. (714) 955-2755. Open 
Mondays through Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Mondays through Thursdays 5:30 
p.m. to 9 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 10. 
</P>
<P>
La Brasserie, 202 S. Main St., Orange. (714) 978-6161. Open Mondays through 
Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Mondays through Saturdays 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Country French cuisine has a huge audience, but many of the restaurants 
advertising it end up serving much fancier dishes instead. (They can charge 
more that way.) The Pleasant Peasant is reasonably priced, with both soup and 
salad included in the prices of main courses. Stick to lamb and anything 
without sauce here. La Brasserie is a lot pricier but also considerably more 
accomplished. The coq au vin rouge is terrific, as is a wonderful homemade 
chicken liver mousse in aspic. Good desserts and plenty of romance here too. 
</P>
<P>
Salud, 17401 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. (714) 842-1194. Open Sundays 
through Thursdays 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Salud, a new high-concept Mexican restaurant from Larry Cano, has an 
outlandish design that looks like a set Roger Corman might have used for a 
movie on Aztec discomania. All the trendy Mexican buttons are pushed: 
hand-shaken margaritas, '80s chiles, blue corn. Avoid the usual Meximush and 
head for the soups, grilled meats and desserts. Pozole verde is hominy and 
shredded chicken in broth, and it's great. So is Ibarra chocolate bread 
pudding, little cubes of fudge soaked bread in a tequila orange cream sauce. 
Prices are reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
Mongkut Thai, 212 Avenida del Mar, San Clemente. (714) 492-3871. 31976 S. Coast 
Highway, South Laguna. (714) 499-2100. Open Mondays through Saturdays, 11 a.m. 
to 3 p.m., and nightly 5 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being one of the current nicknames for Thailand, "Land of Smiles" 
could also describe the type of service you can expect at the often exotic, 
occasionally bland Mongkut Thai restaurants. Here, smiles often substitute for 
intelligible English. Dishes get flowery names such as Glittering Coastal Onyx 
(sauced calamari) or Garnet Ocean Field (crab fried rice) on one of the most 
unusually written menus anywhere. And they can be blisteringly hot. The 
mussuman (beef) curry and the oily, flavorless chicken curry tend to 
disappoint, but most of the fare is exuberant and flavorful. 
</P>
<P>
Z Pizza, 30902 Pacific Coast Highway, South Laguna. (714) 499-4949. Open daily 
from 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
7th Heaven, 3333 Bear St. in the Crystal Court, Costa Mesa. (714) 668- 9464. 
Open Mondays through Fridays 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., Saturdays 9 to 6, Sundays 10 to 
6. 
</P>
<P>
Z Pizza serves eccentric, internationally accented pizzas that have plenty of 
flash and flavors. Particularly engaging is a Moroccan style pizza with 
eggplant and pine nuts, and the Pissaladiere Nicoise, a cheeseless pie with 
anchovies and Provencal herbs. The chewy, fragrant crusts are mini-masterpieces 
all by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
7th Heaven is a movable feast, a full-blown urban takeout emporium for grown-up 
tastes. Don't miss such specialties as Chinese lacquered chicken, jalapeno corn 
pudding or a dazzling array of trendy salads. There are abundant pastes and 
cheeses for the picnic basket. Desserts like bread pudding and rich chocolate 
cookies are terrific. 
</P>
<P>
Scott's Seafood Grill, 3330 Bristol St., Costa Mesa. (714) 979-2400. Open daily 
from 11:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Scott's Seafood Grill made a killer impression on me the first time I ate 
there, but the year was 1976 and the city was San Francisco. That was then, 
this is now. Today, in a stunning new Coast Mesa location, the romance wears a 
bit thin. Good oysters, rich clam chowder and a good wine list make for 
pleasant beginnings but the fresh mesquite-grilled fish is often devoid of 
flavor, as one would expect in such a high-volume operation. Save room for the 
homemade desserts and the good espresso.

STANDOFF IN PANAMA: CONTEST OF TWO WILLS; 
</P>
<P>
SURRENDER: A GENTLE BUT STUBBORN MAN OF THE CLOTH BETTERS THE MAN OF THE GUN, 
THE 'MAXIMUM LEADER.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 11 days, dozens of officials and diplomats from the United States, the 
Vatican and Panama conferred around the clock while their advisers pored over 
constitutions, canon law, extradition treaties and legal precedents -- all in 
an effort to end the agonizing standoff with deposed Panamanian strongman 
Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
But the crisis in Panama City ultimately became a contest of wills between two 
men -- a self-proclaimed "maximum leader" and a gentle but stubborn 
Spanish-born priest. And in the end, the man of the cloth bettered the man of 
the gun. 
</P>
<P>
Senior officials credit Archbishop Jose Sebastian Laboa, the papal nuncio who 
once headed a Vatican tribunal that investigates miracles, with maneuvering 
Noriega through a series of turning points that persuaded him to leave the 
Vatican embassy and surrender to U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Father Laboa was the most instrumental person in making this 
happen," Maj. Gen. Marc Cisneros, the commander of the U.S. Army South and the 
lead American negotiator in Panama, told a news conference in Panama on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official in Washington added: "Once the Vatican made 
clear it would not grant him asylum but would not turn him over to us, we knew 
it all depended on Laboa. He somehow had to convince Noriega to voluntarily 
give up. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting Noriega to leave of his own free will was a horrendous obstacle," the 
official said. "There were many (in the U.S. government) who said he wouldn't 
be able to do it. They were convinced that Noriega would rather come out with 
guns blazing or even take people inside the nunciature hostage in exchange for 
his own freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"But this time Laboa worked his own miracle." 
</P>
<P>
Laboa personally made the decision to grant Noriega refuge in the palm-fringed 
Vatican mission on Christmas Eve, mainly to neutralize Noriega's threat to wage 
a prolonged guerrilla war from the northern Panamanian jungles. 
</P>
<P>
But the 66-year-old priest from the rugged, mountainous Basque region of Spain 
also turned out to be more effective than American forces in getting Noriega 
out. 
</P>
<P>
He did it by playing his own game of psychological warfare -- a one-man version 
of the good-cop, bad-cop routine -- according to a European envoy who was in 
the embassy daily. 
</P>
<P>
During the first part of Noriega's stay, Laboa applied crude pressure and 
veiled threats, according to the envoy and U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega was denied the right to use the telephone, either to take incoming 
calls from his U.S. lawyers or to contact his family, which had taken refuge in 
the Cuban Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
He was kept incommunicado, denied access to newspapers or radio. And the 
television set in the Spartan, white room on the second floor of the 
three-story mansion where he was lodged was broken. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uzi Is Locked Up 
</P>
<P>
He was denied the right to wear a uniform, and the Israeli-made Uzi submachine 
gun he brought with him was locked in a safe. He was dressed instead in plain 
T-shirts and trousers, and the sole adornment in his room was a crucifix. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the strategy, Laboa, along with another priest from the embassy, 
stood outside Noriega's room and discussed his dismal prospects in voices loud 
enough for him to hear, the European diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
The conversation included a reference to Anastasio Somoza, the deposed 
Nicaraguan dictator who was assassinated shortly after his forced exile in 
1979, the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
"The heat was applied literally," a State Department official said. "Even his 
air conditioning was turned off. It had to be a humbling experience that 
demonstrated in stark terms how vulnerable he was." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega quickly became "downcast and moody," according to Marcos G. McGrath, 
the Roman Catholic archbishop of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
It was during this period that Laboa applied the first concrete pressure on 
Noriega, in the form of two letters. 
</P>
<P>
The first was signed by Laboa and relayed to the U.S. Army, authorizing 
American forces to raid the embassy if the nuncio felt threatened by Noriega or 
his supporters who also had holed up inside the mission. 
</P>
<P>
Laboa then orchestrated a campaign to convince Pope John Paul II -- in a letter 
from Panama's bishops -- that the grounds for asylum should be refused. 
</P>
<P>
That letter was sent shortly after Laboa told Noriega that the Vatican would 
probably not grant asylum to the former dictator as a political or diplomatic 
refugee, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letter From Bishops 
</P>
<P>
"The letter from Panama's Catholic bishops, which urged the Vatican not to 
recognize Noriega as a political or diplomatic refugee because of the criminal 
charges against him, helped sway the Vatican," McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega was indicted on drug charges by U.S. grand jurors in February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
After winning assurances from the Bush Administration that the 12-count 
indictment against Noriega would not call for the death penalty, the Vatican 
notified all parties that it would not allow the dictator to stay in the 
embassy for a prolonged period and that it hoped for swift resolution of the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
On the fourth day of his refuge, Noriega became even more isolated. Most of the 
30 supporters, who had been sleeping on cots provided by the U.S. Army in the 
embassy employees' dining hall, walked out of the mission and were detained. 
</P>
<P>
The only others left inside were Noriega's former chief of intelligence, the 
head of his personal bodyguard unit, the director of immigration and his wife 
-- and four Spanish Basque separatists and a Cuban who had also taken refuge in 
the Vatican embassy from the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
"It apparently worked," said the State Department official. "Noriega became 
despondent as he realized he was being abandoned." 
</P>
<P>
As the standoff continued, the European diplomat said, Laboa abandoned the 
initial strategy and carefully began "building an aura of trust" with the 
isolated strongman. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last five days, he (found) that he could get to Noriega by treating him 
well," the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not enough to get Noriega to accept Laboa's appeals to leave. 
</P>
<P>
The second turning point was making Noriega realize that the option of seeking 
refuge in a third country was out, leaving only prosecution in either Panama or 
the United States as the only choices confronting him. 
</P>
<P>
Laboa repeatedly told the deposed leader that no other country was prepared to 
take him. Spain and the Dominican Republic publicly announced that they would 
not grant him safe haven. 
</P>
<P>
But, U.S. officials said, Noriega refused to believe that even Cuba would turn 
him away. Noriega's wife and two children had been granted refuge in the Cuban 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
Then, at some point during the final 48 hours, Laboa, who is also dean of 
Panama's diplomatic corps, presented Noriega with a message from the Cuban 
Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
The message made clear that Havana would not take him, even in the unlikely 
event that the United States would allow him free passage, according to 
Panamanian and U.S. sources. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials believe that Laboa solicited the note, directly or indirectly, 
from his Cuban counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
"My impression is that this message finally convinced Noriega of his total 
isolation," another European diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Added the State Department official, "At this point, he was even less welcome 
than the shah when he left Iran" -- a reference to the wandering exile of Shah 
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi through Morocco, the Bahamas, Mexico, the United States 
and Egypt until his death in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
But just in case Noriega missed the point, the nuncio laid out one last option: 
that the Vatican embassy would haul down its flag and move to new quarters -- 
leaving Noriega alone and exposed. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout this period, Laboa, an extrovert who likes to joke, engaged Noriega 
in frequent daily conversations to build up his trust. 
</P>
<P>
The deposed dictator apparently was not fully aware that Laboa, who never 
masked the church's hostility toward him during his military rule and 
frequently gave asylum to Noriega's opponents, had in fact become his principal 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
The final turning point came Wednesday, when Laboa bluntly informed Noriega 
that "his asylum would expire at noon Thursday," according to a senior 
Administration source. 
</P>
<P>
That threat opened up the possibility of either American troops or Panamanian 
officials taking him into custody. 
</P>
<P>
"Noriega finally had to make a choice," a Pentagon official said. 
</P>
<P>
Laboa also knew that Grupo Direct, an organization of young Panamanian 
professionals, was set to demonstrate Wednesday outside the nunciature. 
</P>
<P>
He encouraged the move as a tactic that would pressure Noriega more effectively 
than the barbed wire, blaring music and deployment of elite Delta force 
commandos around the nunciature. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the final squeeze," said the State Department official. "It was a 
brilliant touch. It was the most effective way of making prosecution in the 
United States look almost inviting. The chanting of thousands of angry people 
haunted him all day." 
</P>
<P>
Added the European diplomat: "The nuncio explained to Noriega that . . . if he 
had stayed in Panama (for trial), he would have been lynched by a mob. 
</P>
<P>
"The only place he could have guaranteed safety was in the United States and he 
could always hope for a mistrial." 
</P>
<P>
The ordeal ended as suddenly -- and secretly -- as it had begun. 
</P>
<P>
The papal nunciature relayed word to Gen. Cisneros, U.S. commander south, on 
Wednesday afternoon that the "end was near," according to the State Department 
official. 
</P>
<P>
While the Vatican slept, the persuasive Spaniard personally negotiated the 
final steps. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, the nunciature told the Americans, had some final requests. He wanted 
the right to wear a uniform and to be met by an officer of general rank, no 
advance publicity, and some time to make calls to his family. Cisneros agreed 
and a uniform was provided. 
</P>
<P>
Laboa insisted that Noriega have a final meal before his long flight to 
captivity in Miami. In turn, the former dictator asked for a souvenir from the 
nunciature -- a Bible -- to take with him. 
</P>
<P>
At 8:48 p.m., Noriega -- accompanied by Laboa and two other priests -- finally 
walked out of the gate. Three minutes later, he was detained by U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a man of God, the nuncio, a priest, and a man of power, General 
Manuel Noriega," Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro mused in obvious elation 
Thursday. "In the end, the man of God won."

THE RISE AND FALL OF MANUEL NORIEGA 
</P>
<P>
Key events related to Gen. Manuel A. Noriega's rule of Panama and his 
overthrow: 
</P>

</P>
<P>
March -- Three of Torrijos' colonels, Ruben Dario Paredes, Roberto Diaz Herrera 
and Noriega, cut a deal to resolve power struggle. Paredes takes over as armed 
forces chief and agrees to retire in 1983, leaving Noriega to take over with 
Diaz Her-rara as second in command. Noriegapromises to deliver 1984 
presidential election to Paredes. 
</P>
<P>
1983 
</P>
<P>
August -- Noriega takes over as military chief. Panamanian legislature passes 
law creating Panama Defense Forces with control over National Guard, police, 
Panama Canal matters and other areas. Noriega reneges on Paredes deal and 
installs his own president in 1984 election. 
</P>
<P>
1987 
</P>
<P>
June -- Diaz Herrera, retiring as second in command, accuses Noriega of 
drug-related activities, rigging 1984 election and murdering Dr. Hugo 
Spadafora, former vice minister of health who accused Noriega of drug 
trafficking. Protest movement demands investigation; street protests are 
brutally crushed. 
</P>
<P>

BIOTECH APPLICATIONS TAKE AN AVERAGE 26 MONTHS TO PROCESS. THE DELAYS THREATEN 
AMERICA'S POSITION ON ONE OF ITS FEW CUTTING EDGE INDUSTRIES.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office received a record 8,000 new applications 
for biotechnology patents in 1989 and most of them have at least two things in 
common: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Each represents a potentially important and lucrative advance in the 
fast-breaking field. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Each will sit unopened for an average of 13.3 months because there are not 
enough qualified patent examiners. 
</P>
<P>
"The applications literally sit around in stacks," said Robert P. Merges, a 
Boston patent law expert. 
</P>
<P>
And that's only half of the story. 
</P>
<P>
Even after an application is opened, another 13 months will elapse before it is 
granted or denied. Genentech Inc., a pioneering Northern California firm, 
waited 10 years before finally obtaining a patent in 1987 for a fundamental 
gene-splicing process called recombinant cloning. 
</P>
<P>
Such delays, apart from representing a bureaucratic irritant to the industry, 
also threaten to seriously erode America's status as world leader in 
translating biotechnology research into useful and marketable products. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we are one of the few technical industries that's really on the 
cutting edge," said Mark Brand, a spokesman for Amgen, a Thousand Oaks, Calif., 
biotech firm. 
</P>
<P>
If the backlog is not significantly and quickly reduced, "Our industry will go 
the way of the automobile industry and consumer electronics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To its critics, the patent office has become a low-tech roadblock in the way of 
high-tech progress. And knowledgeable industry insiders say that certain patent 
office procedures and bookkeeping practices actually mask the severity of the 
delays, which, despite government claims to the contrary, may be growing worse 
instead of better. 
</P>
<P>
Patent officials, pointing to a 13-point biotechnology "catch-up plan," insist 
that the current 26.3 month "pendency period" is decidedly on the wane -- even 
in the face of 12% to 15% annual increases in new applications. 
</P>
<P>
They say that the longest pending case is now just 3 1/2 years old, and they 
further point optimistically to continuing efforts to hire more biotech 
examiners and to start an innovative, industry-government training program for 
new examiners. 
</P>
<P>
"We were on top of a hill. Now we're moving down," said John E. Kittle, 
director of the patent office's beleaguered biotech group. 
</P>
<P>
Kittle believes that his group will reach the targeted 18-month "pendency 
period" by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"That date is too far off to give much comfort to the biotech industry," 
responded Lisa Raines, a patent expert at the Washington-based Industrial 
Biotechnology Assn. 
</P>
<P>
And few outside the patent office believe that goal will be met. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real problem for a new technology like ours -- especially when a firm 
spends so much money to develop something and then not know for so long whether 
it will have a patentable product," said Steve Raines, Genentech's vice 
president for intellectual properties who is unrelated to Lisa Raines. 
</P>
<P>
"To the uninitiated, this might sound like the harmless disorganization of the 
bureaucratic backwater," Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said at a congressional 
hearing last year. 
</P>
<P>
"But particularly for the small U.S. biotechnology companies -- those that are 
staking their future on just one breakthrough -- the current state of affairs 
at the patent office is a crippling hurdle." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the government's new-found resolve to cut the backlog also is 
raising concern that the effort may result in patents of poor quality. That, in 
turn, could hamper the industry's development. 
</P>
<P>
Biotechnology is just entering an initial phase of litigation over patent 
disputes, explained Merges, a Boston University law professor. 
</P>
<P>
"These early cases will lay the foundations of the legal doctrines that emerge 
to guide patent disputes in the industry as it matures," he said. Misguided and 
confusing legal precedents may result from poorly drafted patents, he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
History of Delays 
</P>
<P>
Daunting backlogs at the patent office are nothing new. As early as 1848, 
Congress investigated the problem, which led to the hiring of new examiners. 
</P>
<P>
But things got worse. By 1916, Patent No. 1,203,190 was granted -- 36 years and 
9 months after its initial filing. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the patent office each year receives more than 150,000 applications for 
patents, to be processed by some 1,500 examiners divided into 16 groups by 
subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the average wait for a decision is 18 months. The biotech group's 26.3 
months is the worst among the examining groups. And none of the other groups is 
experiencing a comparable growth rate in new applications. 
</P>
<P>
The makings of the bottleneck can be traced largely to 1980, when the U.S. 
Supreme Court said in a landmark ruling that man-made microorganisms can be 
patented. In that case, a microbiologist had used gene-splicing techniques to 
transform a naturally occurring bacterium into one that had oil-degrading 
capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Such biotechnology advances raged throughout the 1980s. They culminated with a 
1988 patent, issued after four years of waiting, to Harvard University for 
"transgenic non-human mammals." In layman's terms, the advance used recombinant 
DNA techniques to produce lab mice especially vulnerable to carcinogens. The 
cancer-prone mice could help scientists seeking cancer cures and treatments. 
</P>
<P>
Overnight, biotech patent-examiners became swamped. Just over 3,100 
applications were filed in 1982. By 1987, the number nearly doubled. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of pressure from both industry and Congress, the patent office 
issued a "catch-up plan" that included the formation of a separate group within 
the patent office to exclusively process biotech applications. And the number 
of biotech examiners was increased from 67 to 91, then to 112. Another 35 to 40 
biotech examiners are to be hired next year, according to Kittle. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the 112 examiners are so inexperienced that, for the next three 
years or more, they will not be able to work without direct supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Kittle believes that "Group 180," as the biotech section is 
called, is capable now of processing 8,000 applications a year -- about 1,500 
more than before. 
</P>
<P>
And with the various training programs taking shape, the examiners should be 
able not only to clear the logjam, but also to keep up with the unrelenting 
proliferation of new applications, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The patent office also has issued an interim policy that allows biotech 
applicants to seek "special" status for expedited consideration under certain 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the office recently joined with industry to form the Biotechnology 
Institute, which will sponsor continuing-education and "cutting edge" seminars 
as well as training sessions for new examiners. 
</P>
<P>
However, the patent office's short-term goal of reducing the waiting period to 
18 months by 1992 is an unreachable target, according to Lisa Raines of the 
Industrial Biotechnology Assn., who also is a board member of the new 
institute. 
</P>
<P>
"That goal is based on the assumption of all the examiners working full tilt -- 
including the maximum-allowable overtime. But it doesn't take into account that 
many of the examiners are going to law school at night. And it's based on the 
assumption of a low turnover rate," she said. "That level of activity and 
employment are hard to achieve." 
</P>
<P>
Turnover within Group 180 indeed has been a problem. The average tenure of a 
biotech patent examiner is two to three years. 
</P>
<P>
With base annual salaries that range from $26,000 to $63,000, even junior 
examiners can enter the private sector and likely earn far more than they can 
in government. 
</P>
<P>
"Their salaries just are not competitive with industry," said Genentech's Steve 
Raines. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the examiners' jobs are extremely demanding. They must know 
not only patent law, but also learn and then keep up with the changes in 
biotechnology itself so they can decipher abstruse issues like DNA coding 
sequences. 
</P>
<P>
"Just reading the applications alone takes a lot of time." said Lisa Raines. 
"Then you must read the literature in the field prior to the claimed date of 
invention and compare. And you may need additional information from the 
applicant." 
</P>
<P>
"It's all changing, and changing very rapidly," Kittle said. "There's no 
question that there is as much flux as in any area." A recent Government 
Accounting Office study found that it takes about 15% more time to process a 
biotechnology patent than any other kind. 
</P>
<P>
The examiner's job is all the more difficult because many inventors tend to 
make unusually broad claims that exceed their actual achievement -- in 
anticipation of rapid progress in the field. "It is difficult to determine the 
proper patent scope in such cases," said one patent expert. 
</P>
<P>
More than 70 of the biotech examiners hold advanced degrees, including 8 with 
law degrees. Another 19 are currently enrolled in law school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Numbers Game? 
</P>
<P>
According to some private patent lawyers and industry officials, the growing 
pressure to reduce the backlog has led some examiners to coerce companies, 
perhaps on seeming technicalities, to withdraw and then refile their 
applications. Doing that, they said, would make for better statistics because, 
once an application is withdrawn, it is considered disposed of, even if it is 
filed again immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"The patent office may be playing with the numbers," said Hal Wegner, a 
Washington patent lawyer and adjunct professor at George Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
"Attorneys have told me they felt coerced to refile old cases because then the 
patent office can start the clock again. It's a phony bookkeeping system," 
Wegner said. "But that's the only way that office is going to meet the 18-month 
pendency goal." 
</P>
<P>
Kittle hotly denied these charges. "That's absolutely not the case," he said. 
"We're not making them refile. It's their choice." 
</P>
<P>
Kittle said that matters will get better still when the patent office enters 
the computer age. Even today, some 23 million patent documents are filed away 
in wooden shoe box-like containers at the patent office's headquarters in 
northern Virginia. A computer system is about three years behind schedule and 
running at twice the estimated cost.

PACIFIC TELESIS TO CUT 11,000 JOBS IN 5 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pacific Telesis Group said Thursday that it will pare 11,000 of its 69,000 jobs 
-- 16% of the work force -- over the next five years to cut costs amid 
increased competition and new labor-saving technology. 
</P>
<P>
The company, the state's largest private employer, said the job cuts will come 
almost entirely from its Pacific Bell local telephone subsidiary. It said the 
reductions will be achieved through early-retirement incentives, retraining and 
attrition, but a job-seeking service will also be set up for employees 
accepting severance pay and leaving the company. 
</P>
<P>
Which jobs will be axed -- and how heavily the cuts will fall on Pacific Bell's 
28,000 Southern California employees -- remains to be determined, a spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts are among the largest in a series of reductions that have pared 17,000 
jobs from Pacific Telesis since it was created in 1984 as one of seven regional 
holding companies spun off from giant American Telephone &amp; Telegraph as 
part of an antitrust settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Telesis attributed the latest cuts to increased competition from 
upstart telephone firms that are chipping away at its monopoly and taking away 
some of its largest customers. In addition, new labor-saving telecommunications 
technology is making many jobs unneeded. 
</P>
<P>
"One person can do the job of three or four," observed Stuart Crane, an analyst 
with Gruntal &amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts also stem from a new California regulatory system that provides 
Pacific Bell incentives to reduce costs to increase profits. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying out the job-reduction program, including costs of early-retirement 
incentives, will not have a significant impact on profits, Pacific Telesis 
said. Analysts also noted that the cutback is not a sign of financial 
difficulty at the San Francisco-based firm, which is among the strongest of the 
so-called Baby Bells spun off from AT&amp;T. 
</P>
<P>
All but 50 of the jobs to be cut will come from giant Pacific Bell. The other 
50 jobs are to be cut during 1990 from Pacific Telesis' present headquarters 
staff of about 400.

"Staffing requirements change over time in this dynamic industry," said Pacific 
Bell President Phil Quigley. "What was appropriate in 1989 clearly will not be 
in 1994." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell will lose about 7,600 non-salaried jobs and 3,400 management 
positions, he said. The job cuts do not affect Pacific Telesis' unregulated 
ventures, which are grouped under PacTel Corp. These include PacTel Cellular in 
Costa Mesa, PacTel Paging, Pacific Telesis International, PacTel Business 
Systems and PacTel Properties. 
</P>
<P>
Some layoffs will probably prove inevitable, the company acknowledged, but 
Pacific Telesis will try to minimize that by offering incentives for veteran 
employees to retire early by adding three years to both their service and their 
age in calculating pension benefits. That incentive trimmed a third of the 
management staff of Nevada Bell, a Pacific Telesis subsidiary that serves the 
Reno area. Other employees in jobs identified as surplus will be offered 
training for other posts or assignment to lower-ranking slots, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to operate even more efficiently in the 1990s, so we can deliver 
the maximum benefits to our customers and share-owners," said Sam Ginn, Pacific 
Telesis' chairman and chief executive. "Looking ahead, we remain keenly focused 
on our customers and the need to streamline operations so we can meet the 
challenges of increasing competition." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts generally welcomed the announcement but said it was no surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"The driving force of the telecommunications industry is technology," said 
analyst Crane of Gruntal &amp; Co. "Switches today are gigantic computers that 
are highly automated. They do almost anything. So all you need is people to 
supervise these massive machines and keep an eye on them." 
</P>
<P>
Another incentive to cut costs stems from a new regulatory system in California 
that requires Pacific Bell to lower costs by 4.5% a year to reflect anticipated 
labor-saving improvements from new technology. But the new system also allows 
the company to earn more, if it can, than was possible under the old system, 
which set a tight limit on profits. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, despite their present monopoly in providing local telephone service, 
Pacific Bell and the other Baby Bells already are losing some business from 
major customers, mainly financial services firms. These companies are either 
erecting microwave towers to create their own private phone system, or 
contracting with Pacific Bell or a growing number of newcomers that provide 
private links for them. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, this traffic bypasses the "public network" that most businesses and 
residential customers depend on. 
</P>
<P>
This bypassing was encouraged in California and some other states, including 
New York, when regulators opened one area of the monopoly to competition -- the 
lucrative high-speed transmission of data. Moreover, the California Public 
Utilities Commission this year will consider prying open other areas of the 
local monopoly. And the Federal Communications Commission and Congress are 
re-examining national cable television law, which presently forbids local phone 
companies to carry cable television in their service areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We may see in the next decade, more than one (local) phone company serving an 
area," suggested Steve Sazebari of the Dataquest research firm in San Jose. "In 
any case, they have to be more competitive in price and quality, so basically 
they have to cut costs." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell serve nearly 22 million people in California and 
the Reno area. 
</P>
<P>
NEW RIVALS -- Pacific Bell, like former parent AT&amp;T, is facing increasing 
competition from upstart phone firms. D1.

NORIEGA CHALLENGES U.S. RIGHT TO TRY HIM ON DRUG CHARGES; 
</P>
<P>
ARRAIGNMENT: FEDERAL JUDGE IN MIAMI ENTERS 'NOT GUILTY' PLEA FOR THE DEPOSED 
PANAMANIAN DICTATOR. A YEAR OF PRETRIAL MANEUVERING BY HIS DEFENSE TEAM IS 
EXPECTED.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly two years after he challenged the United States to bring him to justice 
on drug charges, Manuel A. Noriega stood before a federal judge in a heavily 
guarded Miami courtroom Thursday, a defendant in the grasp of the U.S. legal 
system that he had scorned for so long. 
</P>
<P>
The deposed Panamanian dictator declared through his lawyers, on his first day 
in the United States, that the government has no legal jurisdiction to try him 
on drug-trafficking charges here. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler entered a plea of "not guilty" for 
Noriega at the arraignment and ordered that preparations begin for his trial on 
the charges, which were handed down by a federal grand jury in February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The former leader, who wore a freshly starched khaki Panamanian military 
uniform, was remanded to the custody of U.S. marshals for what could be a year 
of pretrial maneuverings by his legal defense team. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega had reached the United States in predawn darkness after a 5 1/4-hour 
flight from Panama City aboard a U.S. Air Force C-130 cargo airplane. During 
the trip, he was placed in handcuffs -- at least temporarily -- and was read, 
in Spanish, his constitutional rights to a lawyer and to remain silent. 
</P>
<P>
His surrender Wednesday evening as he walked out the gate of the Vatican 
embassy, where he had taken refuge on Christmas Eve, ended a nearly two-year 
campaign by two U.S. administrations to remove him from power and bring him to 
the United States to face prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by agents for the Drug Enforcement Administration, Noriega landed 
early Thursday at Homestead Air Force Base, 25 miles south of Miami, and was 
believed to have been taken directly to the federal courthouse here. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Bush Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 
Noriega's decision to surrender may have been clinched by word that his 
sanctuary "would expire" at noon Thursday. The official speculated that, faced 
with a growing crowd of angry Panamanians outside the embassy, Noriega may have 
opted for the protection offered by U.S. custody. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's arraignment began what is certain to be a drawn-out legal affair. It 
is uncertain whether the Adminstration can back up months of tough talk about 
Noriega's role in drug smuggling with a successful prosecution through 
uncharted legal principles. 
</P>
<P>
First, there is the knotty issue of arresting a former government leader beyond 
U.S. borders. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Noriega's lawyers are expected to seek classified U.S. documents dealing 
with his acknowledged past cooperation with the CIA and Drug Enforcement 
Administration. They also are likely to argue that he cannot receive a fair 
trial because of adverse publicity. Such issues could take months to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wears Gold Stars 
</P>
<P>
While marshals with binoculars scanned the downtown area from atop the 
courthouse, Noriega was brought by private elevator to the crowded ninth-floor 
courtroom from a basement jail cell. On the shoulders of his khaki shirt he 
wore the gold stars of a general -- his rank as former chief of the Panama 
Defense Forces. 
</P>
<P>
Using earphones to hear the judge's questions translated into Spanish by a 
court interpreter, Noriega spoke little except to indicate three times that he 
understood the charges but would not enter a plea. 
</P>
<P>
"My attorney has explained everything," Noriega responded when Hoeveler asked 
him why he was remaining mute. He appeared calm but subdued throughout the 
25-minute proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Frank Rubino took the hearing by surprise by declaring at the 
outset that his client "refuses to submit to the jurisdiction of this court." 
</P>
<P>
"He is a political prisoner brought to this country illegally," Rubino 
continued, adding that Noriega's indictment on drug charges in Miami and Tampa, 
Fla., in 1988 was "politically motivated" and that the Dec. 20 invasion of 
Panama by U.S. forces was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
As a head of state, Noriega had immunity from criminal charges by U.S. grand 
juries, Rubino told Hoeveler. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials maintain that Noriega willingly surrendered. But his attorney 
argued that Noriega was coerced, saying that he had been warned that protection 
would be withdrawn as crowds surrounded the Vatican embassy. Noriega 
surrendered to avoid further bloodshed, Rubino told the court. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Atty. Dexter Lehtinen of Miami countered that the immunity question 
was settled long ago and that Noriega's surrender to U.S. forces Wednesday 
brought him legally into custody. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rejected Claims 
</P>
<P>
Lehtinen referred to the fact that a year ago, Hoeveler rejected defense claims 
that the United States had no jurisdiction over Noriega as a head of state. The 
judge said then that the State Department had not recognized the general's 
political legitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking privately, some U.S. officials said Noriega is likely to be kept for 
extended periods of time, pending more pretrial hearings, in a cell at the 
courthouse, a modern structure with many amenities. In previous cases involving 
accused narcotics traffickers, defense lawyers have protested when their 
clients were moved for security reasons to federal prisons some distance away. 
</P>
<P>
Rubino did not seek Noriega's release on bond because of his argument that the 
court does not have jurisdiction over Noriega. It is doubtful that Hoeveler 
would have granted bail, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
One day after the quiet denouement of the nearly two-year drama that began with 
the indictments, the Bush Administration's celebrations were muted. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush kept to an apparently low-key schedule, making no public 
appearances and no public comments about Noriega on Thursday. White House Press 
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush spoke briefly by telephone with Pope John 
Paul II, to thank the pontiff for the Vatican's help in persuading Noriega to 
surrender. 
</P>
<P>
"The President is gratified the operation has been completed in such a 
successful fashion," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
A senior White House official said the reaction within the White House to 
Noriega's decision to leave the protection of the Vatican embassy generally was 
subdued. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the reason is the attitude has been that ultimately he would have to 
come out" of the embassy to which he had fled, the official said. "I don't 
think there is a great deal of surprise or euphoria." 
</P>
<P>
But the low-key approach was also intentional. It reflected the 
Administration's sensitivity to the need to avoid making statements that could 
be considered prejudicial in a court of law and that could thus provide 
Noriega's defense attorneys with grounds to argue that government officials' 
public comments make it impossible to find an impartial jury. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration, which aggressively denounced Noriega in earlier days as a 
"narco-terrorist," sharply toned down its rhetoric to language that would be 
acceptable in a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Before Bush announced Noriega's surrender, White House lawyers took the unusual 
step of reviewing every word in the brief statement that the President 
delivered to a national television audience Wednesday evening. They were making 
sure that it included no remarks that could risk damaging the impartiality of a 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Kollin, Rubino's co-counsel representing Noriega, said before the court 
appearance that "the unparalleled pretrial publicity in this case makes it 
almost impossible, we believe, to find 12 jurors that do not have a 
predisposition to this matter." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that secret documents spelling out his client's ties to the CIA 
"are necessary to defend our client" -- raising the shadow of conflict with the 
Justice Department over disclosing government secrets. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said, however: "We're satisfied that there's no bar 
whatsoever to going forward with the charges, using the evidence that we have, 
to sustain the charges contained in the indictment. We're not worried about 
anything that may be raised by way of defense." 
</P>
<P>
In the Miami indictment, Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes 
from Colombian drug cartels to aid and protect their smuggling and processing 
-- charges that could carry 145 years in prison and $1.1 million in fines. A 
separate indictment in Tampa accuses him of marijuana trafficking; he is 
expected to be tried later on those charges. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, meanwhile, was described by Archbishop Marcos G. McGrath of Panama as 
having been "downcast and a bit moody" and having "kept pretty much to himself" 
during his stay in the Vatican embassy in Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
By landing on the doorstep of the Vatican on Dec. 24, Noriega threw the United 
States, the new Panamanian government and the Pope into what Bush called a 
three-way "conundrum." 
</P>
<P>
The matter came to a head, according to a senior Bush Administration official, 
when the papal nuncio, Archbishop Jose Sebastian Laboa, decided that Noriega's 
asylum would expire by noon Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
When he left the embassy, Noriega asked for a memento and left a letter to the 
Pope, Navarro said. The memento chosen was said to be a Bible, and the letter's 
contents are not known. Laboa was forwarding the sealed letter by diplomatic 
pouch to the Vatican.

William D. Montalbano in Rome also contributed to this report.

<P>
CHARGES AGAINST NORIEGA 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Manuel A. Noriega and 12 others were indicted by a federal grand jury in 
Miami in February, 1988, on 12 counts of taking part in a criminal enterprise 
in violation of the U.S. racketeering and drug laws. If convicted, Noriega 
faces a maximum 145-year prison term and more than $1 million in fines. He is 
specifically accused of: 
</P>
<P>
Accepting a $4.6-million bribe from Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to protect 
shipments of cocaine, launder money, supply drug laboratories and shield drug 
traffickers from the law. 
</P>
<P>
Allowing smugglers to use Panama as a way station for U.S.-bound cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Utilizing his official positions both before and after he took power in 1983 to 
provide protection for international narcotics traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Arranging for the shipment of cocaine-processing chemicals, including those 
seized by Panamanian police. 
</P>
<P>
Laundering cartel narcotics proceeds in Panamanian banks. 
</P>
<P>
Allowing cartel leaders to shift operations to Panama to escape a crackdown in 
Colombia after the assassination of that country's anti-drug minister of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling to Havana so Cuban President Fidel Castro could mediate a dispute 
with the Medellin cartel after Panamanian troops seized a drug laboratory that 
Noriega had been paid to protect. 
</P>
<P>
A federal grand jury in Tampa, also in February, 1988, indicted Noriega on 
three counts of marijuana trafficking. That indictment accuses him of 
attempting to import more than 1.4 million pounds of marijuana into the United 
States and accepting a $1-million bribe from drug dealers for allowing them to 
smuggle 400,000 pounds of marijuana and launder more than $100 million in 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department has said prosecutors plan to prosecute Noriega first on 
the more serious Miami charges and then bring him to trial on the Tampa 
indictment.

U.S. PROSECUTORS PICKING WAY IN A LEGAL MINEFIELD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Not until the Air Force plane had cleared Panamanian airspace, not until 45 
minutes after U.S. military authorities took him in tow outside the papal 
embassy and whisked him away in a helicopter to the waiting plane did a federal 
drug agent officially place deposed Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega 
under arrest and read him his rights in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
The carefully choreographed sequence reflected the fact that, before they can 
bring Noriega to justice for alleged drug activities, prosecutors must first 
pick their way across some tricky legal ground. 
</P>
<P>
Initially at least, Justice Department lawyers were successful. And they may 
well continue to prevail as they move toward a trial. But the Noriega case 
raises a host of difficult legal issues, and the final outcome of the Bush 
Administration's bold action will not be known until all those issues have been 
reviewed and resolved by American courts. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately, there is the question of whether the way Noriega was taken into 
custody and then formally arrested complies with the requirements of U.S. law 
and thus provides a valid basis for proceeding to trial. 
</P>
<P>
The "conscious" decision to make an unusual airborne arrest was aimed at 
heading off anticipated claims by Noriega's defense attorneys that U.S. agents 
lacked authority to arrest him on Panamanian soil. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, along with other U.S. officials, took the position 
Thursday that Noriega had surrendered voluntarily at the papal nunciature in 
Panama City. That "really puts a lot of those (legal) questions on the shelf," 
he declared. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's lawyers immediately disagreed. They maintained that there was nothing 
"voluntary" about Noriega's surrender, that he was coerced into leaving the 
nunciature in Panama City where he had sought asylum and that U.S. courts lack 
jurisdiction over the former head of state. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, months before his death, lawyers for deposed Philippine President 
Ferdinand E. Marcos argued similarly that he could not be tried in a U.S. court 
for his actions as a head of state. But the arguments were rejected in the 
lower federal courts, and in April, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his 
appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime Thursday, arguments sharpened within the U.S. government over whether 
the February, 1988, indictments of Noriega on drug trafficking, money 
laundering and racketeering charges were a "rush job" that could create future 
problems for the government. 
</P>
<P>
Critics charged that federal prosecutors failed to investigate fully whether 
his work for the CIA and Drug Enforcement Administration involved material that 
the government cannot afford to reveal at trial. 
</P>
<P>
A senior government official said that Noriega was not the primary target of 
the federal indictment in Miami but was added only after prosecutors ran across 
his name when poring over documentary evidence in the case, in which a number 
of other defendants also were charged. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unprecedented Move 
</P>
<P>
"Until then, nobody had even thought about the possibility of prosecuting him, 
especially since he was the leader of a foreign government, and we had never 
done anything like that before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But William F. Weld, who was assistant attorney general in charge of the 
Justice Department's criminal division at the time Noriega was indicted, 
disputed this account in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Noriega was not added to either indictment at the last minute," said Weld, who 
is a candidate for the Republican nomination for governor of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
The senior government official, who declined to be named, said that the 
decision to indict Noriega "did not get the kind of scrubbing on foreign policy 
issues we normally expect at the senior level, because the proposal for 
indicting was floated up here (Washington) in a last-minute kind of way." 
</P>
<P>
He added that then-Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III "was not in a position to 
exercise the kind of judgment he should have." Meese at that time was under 
such intense criticism for having granted a controversial delay in a federal 
grand jury's investigation in Miami of a matter related to the Iran-Contra 
scandal that he "didn't think he could tell the prosecutor not to indict 
Noriega," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
But Weld and others involved in the pre-indictment process in 1988 recalled 
meeting with CIA and National Security Council officials about the case. "We 
hashed out the whole thing," and the intelligence agency officials were asked 
to bring up any problems with going ahead, Weld said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying everybody was thrilled" with the idea of prosecuting Noriega, 
but no problems were brought to prosecutors' attention, he said. "I remember 
being absolutely satisfied that (the indictment) was not going to be subject to 
attack" by Noriega's lawyers on grounds that they had to reveal government 
secrets to defend their client adequately. 
</P>
<P>
Senate sources contended that the Noriega prosecutors were in "a rush to 
indict" before some witnesses in the case testified before a hearing by a 
Senate subcommittee. "They didn't want it to look as if their indictments were 
built on (Capitol) Hill revelations," one source involved in the matter said. 
</P>
<P>
But the subcommittee did conduct scaled-down hearings before the indictments 
were returned. 
</P>
<P>
David Runkel, the Justice Department's chief spokesman, stuck by his earlier 
statement that there had been "some rush to draw up the Noriega indictment" in 
the face of denials by prosecutors who were involved. 
</P>
<P>
Runkel did back away from his earlier statement that the case against Noriega 
was being bolstered by evidence uncovered during the U.S. invasion of Panama. 
He said Thursday that there had been no decision on whether that material would 
be used -- raising doubts about whether the evidence could withstand challenge 
from Noriega's defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's attorneys got nowhere Thursday with their argument that the U.S. 
courts do not have jurisdiction over him because he was the head of a sovereign 
foreign government, not a common criminal. That argument had been rejected in 
pretrial proceedings shortly after the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
In pressing their argument, which will almost certainly be renewed at a later 
stage in the proceedings, Noriega's lawyers can cite two 19th-Century legal 
doctrines that call for a hands-off approach to foreign officials. 
</P>
<P>
Under the doctrine of "foreign sovereign immunity," a head of state is 
personally immune under international law for his actions taken while in office 
-- even after he leaves office. 
</P>
<P>
Under the "act of state doctrine," the U.S. courts, as a matter of policy, have 
been unwilling to judge the actions of a foreign government official taken on 
foreign soil. For example, a leader of the Romanian secret police could not be 
hauled into a U.S. court and tried for having beaten or shot a protester in 
Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Noriega's attorney, Frank Rubino, sought to invoke those 
jurisdictional arguments, telling U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler in 
Miami that his client was "a head of state and immune from prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
But Hoeveler rejected the defense contention. 
</P>
<P>
"Official immunity only covers acts within the scope of office. Narcotics 
trafficking is not normally considered an act of state," said UCLA Law Prof. 
Phillip Trimble.

Many of them told of fantasies of killing Gen. Manuel A. Noriega. Shooting him 
between the eyes. Or tearing him limb from limb. Or maybe just getting in a 
good punch or spitting into his face. 
</P>
<P>
It was an angry crowd, even in triumph. "If I were to see Noriega, I wouldn't 
know what to do, I would need a rifle so bad," said one of them, Carlos 
Vallarino, a 35-year-old laborer. 
</P>
<P>
In this city so heavily populated with Latinos, only about 7,000 are 
Panamanians. Thursday was their day of revenge. Scores of them circled the 
Federal Courthouse downtown, where Noriega -- the man they call "Pineapple 
Face" -- was to be arraigned on the ninth floor. 
</P>
<P>
Security was pervasive. U.S. marshals peered into the crowd from rooftop 
perches. Police on horseback trotted up and down the surrounding streets. Squad 
cars rolled past, sometimes 10 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, in a basement holding cell, Noriega awaited his first day in court. "I 
just want to get one look at him and tell him a few things, that he's an 
assassin . . . and that he destroyed our country," said Jose Clement, 25, a 
student two years in exile.

</P>
<P>
But the crowd did not get even a glance at its villain. Instead, the people 
stood in small groups, waved makeshift placards and submitted to the 
questioning of reporters -- themselves a horde that outnumbered even the 
Panamanians. 
</P>
<P>
Miami, as so often before, is the site of a major news story. This time, 
however, the city has done little to merit the notice; it is merely the place 
where the Noriega charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of journalists descended. "There are more satellite dishes here now 
than there were for the Pope," said Xavier Suarez, the city's mayor. A parking 
lot across from the courthouse was filled entirely with TV trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few dozen reporters were permitted into the arraignment; 100 or so 
others milled about in a closed-off street, peeking into each others' note 
pads, like high schoolers cheating on an algebra final. 
</P>
<P>
From time to time, the crowd provided a tidbit. Once, someone suddenly shouted 
"Kill him!" and people began to run. A phalanx of police were pushing a young 
Latino toward the nearby Greyhound bus station. 
</P>
<P>
The man was Jose Cepero, a Cuban-American, and the police were ushering him to 
safety. He had dared to raise a sign saying "U.S. Hands Off Panama," and the 
crowd turned on him. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe Noriega should be penalized," Cepero said as he was hauled off, 
trying to clarify his views. "I just don't think the U.S. military should have 
gotten involved." 
</P>
<P>
An hour later, the crowd also turned on a drunk who shouted something contrary 
to the prevailing mood. Police rushed him away, too. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be better to get our hands on Noriega, but anyone even a little 
pro-Noriega will have to do for now," said Silvio Cordoba Quinonez, who had 
joined the chase. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Celebrating Begins 
</P>
<P>
The celebrating here had begun late Wednesday, as a crowd of 200 clustered 
outside the gates of Homestead Air Force Base, about 25 miles south of Miami, 
to await Noriega's arrival aboard a military C-130 transport. 
</P>
<P>
No one got a look at him then, either, but the vigil turned into a festive 
street party anyway. People placed Noriega-style sunglasses on pineapples and 
held the eerie faces aloft. Finally, they smashed the fruit on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
The plane bearing Noriega touched down in the early morning hours, but he spent 
only minutes at the Homestead base before being sped to the courthouse in a 
12-car motorcade. The automobiles zoomed into the building's garage in the 
darkness of pre-dawn, but some bystanders managed a look. 
</P>
<P>
Mayin Correa, an exiled Panamanian journalist, said she saw Noriega hunched 
down in the car, turning away from the lights of the cameras. She will never 
forget how he hid his face. And how it pleased her. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot call him a leader any more," she said. "He gave up like all 
dictators, as a coward." 
</P>

U.S. LAWMAKERS SEE BIG CHALLENGE IN REBUILDING; 
</P>
<P>
FOREIGN AID: PART OF THE ASSISTANCE BUDGET MAY NEED TO BE REALLOCATED TO GIVE 
PANAMA HIGHER PRIORITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Members of Congress on Thursday hailed the apprehension of Manuel A. Noriega as 
a key victory in the war against drugs, but they cautioned that the United 
States now faces an even tougher challenge in rebuilding Panama's shattered 
government and crippled economy. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said that part of next year's foreign 
aid budget -- already stretched thin by commitments to Egypt, Israel and 
Eastern Europe -- may need to be reallocated to give Panama a higher priority. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was suggesting a reduction in assistance to Israel and Egypt, the 
two largest single recipients of U.S. aid, Dole replied, "I am suggesting that 
we only have so much." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), who returned 
Wednesday from a 36-hour visit to Panama, said the country will require 
"hundreds of millions of dollars" in assistance over the long run -- a 
commitment that he suggested the United States could not meet alone. 
</P>
<P>
"No one should think that the key to (Panama's) economic recovery will be U.S. 
aid, although that will be part of it," Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had discussed Panama's aid expectations with the new government of 
President Guillermo Endara, Nunn replied: 
</P>
<P>
"We did not get any dollar amount from the Endara government, but they made it 
plain they are expecting American aid. They made it plain they have big 
economic problems. But they also made it plain they are going to ask other 
nations, not just us." 
</P>
<P>
At the request of House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), a bipartisan 
delegation of key House committee members led by Majority Leader Richard A. 
Gephardt (D-Mo.) left for Panama on Thursday to discuss future economic and 
political needs with U.S. and Panamanian officials. 
</P>
<P>
"These meetings will help us answer key questions . . . including the length of 
the U.S. military occupation, the means available to us to support the 
democratization of Panama (and) the requirements for U.S. private and public 
sector assistance to rebuild the Panamanian economy," Gephardt told reporters 
before the delegation's departure from Andrews Air Force Base outside 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Dole, noting that Bush's military intervention to oust Noriega enjoyed "broad 
bipartisan support," said that the White House "had not put a dollar figure on 
aid to Panama yet." 
</P>
<P>
But he added that both the Bush Administration and Congress, which recovenes 
Jan. 23, will need to "take a look at reallocating some of our priorities in 
foreign assistance . . . to address economic problems in Panama as well as in 
Poland." 
</P>
<P>
The minority leader suggested that one way around the politically thorny 
question of what to cut would be to give the Administration "more flexibility" 
in allocating foreign aid by earmarking less of it in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers indicated that the responsibility the United States assumed for 
Panama when it invaded last month may now be greater and more complex than many 
at first had assumed. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Noriega and his military aides controlled virtually every important 
aspect of Panamanian life, Nunn said, "It is hard for people in this country to 
understand the pervasiveness of Noriega and the Panama Defense Forces." 
</P>
<P>
Panama, Nunn said, is entering "a nation-building phase" in which Washington 
will need to help Endara create a democratic government, reform a mismanaged 
economy and clean up the widespread corruption of the Noriega regime. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these reservations, senators and congress members were unanimous in 
offering bipartisan praise for the Administration's handling of the Panama 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"I commend President Bush and all U.S. officials who played a role in making 
certain that Noriega was brought to the U.S.," said Senate Majority Leader 
George J. Mitchell (D-Me.). 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) called Noriega's apprehension a "triumph for 
justice," while Rep. Jim Courter (R-N.J.) said that it sends a message "to the 
narco-terrorists and drug kingpins of the Third World . . . (that) the United 
States will not allow criminals who poison our children sanctuary anywhere in 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell and other Democrats added that it now is important to lower U.S. 
military visibility in Panama and remove the rest of its combat troops as 
quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn said that disengagement is crucial to the Endara government's efforts to 
establish its own credibility and legitimacy. He called for a two-phase 
replacement of U.S. combat forces over the next few weeks -- first by military 
personnel trained in civilian management and later by State Department and 
civilian experts. 
</P>
<P>
The risk of maintaining a high U.S. profile in Panama, Nunn said, is that as 
time goes on, Panamanians who now blame their economic problems on Noriega "are 
going to start blaming them on the United States" if there is no visible 
progress in solving them.

WORLD REACTION TO NORIEGA'S ARREST;

<P>
The arrest and trial of ousted Panamanian dictator Manuel A. Noriega by the 
United States is illegal, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said 
in Moscow. "No state has the right to take the law into its own hands," he 
said. "That's basically lynch law." He said the trial violates the rights of 
Panama and the U.N. principle of nonintervention. "We think that Gen. Noriega 
used to be a CIA agent," Gerasimov said. "And as your President Roosevelt said 
about (the late Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio) Somoza, he's an SOB, but he's 
our SOB. So, this particular SOB was your SOB and then he went astray, and now 
you want to capture him." 
</P>
<P>
Latin America 
</P>
<P>
News of Noriega's capture was splashed across the front pages of most Latin 
American dailies. However, it was received in silence by most national leaders 
there, who are leery of supporting what one official called Washington's role 
as a "regional policeman." 
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez said: "It's such a delicate and 
serious subject that I would prefer not to comment on it until I've thought it 
through and met with my advisers." 
</P>
<P>
Peru expressed "satisfaction over the surrender of Gen. Noriega to United 
States justice." However, like most Latin American nations, it refuses to 
recognize the U.S.-installed Panamanian government. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexico City daily La Jornada editorialized: "The fate of Noriega has 
nothing to do with the existence in the country of the canal, of a puppet 
regime imposed by U.S. tanks. . . . Who's next? What country in the region will 
be the next victim of the United States army?" 
</P>
<P>
In Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega said the United States should immediately 
withdraw its troops. "Noriega is already in the power of the Yankees," he said 
on government radio. "So, there isn't a single reason for the Yankees to remain 
in Panama, not one more moment." Leftist Nicaragua opposed the U.S. invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Europe 
</P>
<P>
In Britain, the Foreign Office said: "We are glad that this problem between the 
U.S. and the Vatican has been resolved. Noriega faces criminal charges and we 
are naturally pleased that he should be brought to justice." Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher fully backed the U.S. invasion. 
</P>
<P>
In Spain, Foreign Affairs Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez said Noriega's 
surrender "appears to be a voluntary decision by Noriega, and that's how I 
suppose the Vatican will underscore it. . . . We want Panama to recover its 
moral conscience, which has been left enormously perturbed as a result of all 
these events." Spain opposed the U.S. invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Asia 
</P>
<P>
Japan's Foreign Ministry said the matter is strictly among the United States, 
Panama and the Vatican. Japan has not recognized Panama's new government but 
has "an impression" that it is "a remarkable improvement." 
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, a spokesman said: "As drug trafficking affects countries 
internationally, we are happy that the accused will be tried fairly in a U.S. 
court. . . . I think this will lead to more permanent peace in Panama."

AZERBAIJANI DEMONSTRATORS SAID TO BE LEAVING BORDER

A protest organizer said Azerbaijani demonstrators began drawing back from the 
Soviet-Iranian border Thursday after trying for four days to force open the 
frontier crossing and reunite with their brethren in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
The KGB reinforced its border troops in the area Wednesday to stop protesters 
from smashing guard towers and security alarms. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Rabochaya Tribuna, or Workers' Tribune, reported Thursday: "The 
border posts themselves are under threat, and the rampaging ruffians have gone 
so far as to promise retribution against the soldiers of the border patrol and 
their family members." 
</P>
<P>
But dissident writer Yusif Samedoglu reported by telephone Thursday from Baku, 
capital of the republic of Azerbaijan: "The situation is stabilizing. People 
are gradually going home." 
</P>
<P>
Samedoglu leads the grass-roots political Azerbaijani People's Front, which 
organized the protest. 
</P>
<P>
Savili A. Perets, deputy director of the official news agency Azerinform, also 
said in a telephone interview from Baku that the border area was calming down. 
He said Azerbaijan party chief Abdul-Rakhman Vezirov and other officials 
traveled Thursday from Baku to the border area to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
The Azerbaijanis began demonstrating Sunday for unification of their Soviet 
republic with Iran's northern Azerbaijan province, a region peopled by their 
ethnic kin. They threatened to remove all barriers along the nearly 500-mile 
border if authorities failed to do so themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The disturbances were the latest flare-up in two years of ethnic unrest among 
Azerbaijanis, Armenians, Georgians, Abkhazians and other ethnic groups in the 
Soviet Caucasus region. More than 300 people died nationwide in ethnic unrest 
in two years. 
</P>
<P>
Iran has protested the unrest, but Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. 
Gerasimov said Thursday, "It's not a big international issue." 
</P>
<P>
Five young men from Soviet Azerbaijan cut barbed wire border fences on the Aras 
River that forms the border with Iran and four managed to swim to the Iranian 
side, Iran's TV network reported in a broadcast monitored in Cyprus. The fifth 
drowned in the incident Wednesday, it said. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time the unrest was reported in Iranian news media. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Azerbaijanis, who are largely Shiite Muslims, want freedom to trade 
with their ethnic kin in Iran and cross the frontier, practices that dictator 
Josef Stalin suspended.

Senior editors and reporters dismissed from the Jerusalem Post said Thursday 
they will launch a new English-language newspaper backed by Israeli and foreign 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 Post staff members were let go this week at their request after 
failing to oust publisher Yehuda Levy. 
</P>
<P>
They had argued that he impeded editorial freedom and intended to alter the 
dovish line of the Post, a prominent liberal Zionist institution. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to re-embody the spirit of the Jerusalem Post," said former 
Managing Editor David Landau. "We are the spirit, and people are telling us 
that there can be a new body. We are looking for it." 
</P>
<P>
The dismissed staff included top news editors and political reporters and the 
entire economics department, sparking concern about the demise of the Post. 
Conrad Black's Toronto-based Hollinger Inc. bought the paper last year.

HONECKER RELEASED FROM MONTHLONG HOUSE ARREST

Erich Honecker, the deposed Communist leader of East Germany, has been released 
from house arrest, the chief of the national criminal police reported Thursday. 
Honecker, 77 and ailing, had been confined to his home since Dec. 5 while the 
new government investigated charges against him of corruption and abuse of 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Helmut Nettweg, chief of the criminal police, said Thursday that the decision 
to place Honecker under house arrest "had no legal basis." He said he does not 
know whether Honecker, who was ousted Oct. 18, is still the subject of an 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Uwe Hempel, a Defense Ministry spokesman, told reporters that the 
period of compulsory military service will be reduced from 18 months to 12. 
Also, he said, military personnel will now be permitted to travel to the West 
like other East German citizens. 
</P>
<P>
In time, Hempel said, the reduction in military service will mean a sharp 
decline in the armed forces' strength, by 25,000 to 30,000. The East German 
military's present strength is estimated at 120,000 servicemen and women. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry announcement came after reports that soldiers were 
striking for better conditions and complaining that they could be better 
employed in industry. 
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, six East German opposition groups agreed to form an alliance in 
preparation for national elections scheduled for May. 
</P>
<P>
The official East German news agency ADN quoted Steffen Reiche, a leader of the 
Social Democratic Party, as saying that his party will enter into a coalition 
with New Forum, the largest of the pro-democracy forces, along with Democracy 
Now, Democratic Awakening, the Initiative for Peace and Human Rights, and the 
United Left. 
</P>
<P>
The new coalition will be known as Election Alliance 90. The news agency said 
the coalition has no intention of becoming a party and that it will campaign as 
an "interest group." 
</P>
<P>
As the result of Honecker's being released from house arrest, he will be forced 
to move from his luxurious home in the compound at Wandlitz, which under the 
old regime was reserved for members of the Politburo. The new leadership plans 
to turn the place into a sanitarium for the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Meyer, a government spokesman, told reporters that Honecker "has been 
offered an apartment in Berlin."

S. LEBANON COMBAT BLAMED ON SPONSORS

<P>
With the struggle for power in Lebanon stalemated in Beirut, fighting between 
rival Muslim militias has scorched a string of strategic villages in the rocky 
hill country of the south. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, guerrillas of the pro-Syrian Amal militia and the Iranian-backed 
Hezbollah (Party of God) again traded machine-gun and rocket fire in a conflict 
that has taken 72 lives and wounded more than 250 since it erupted Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanese analysts attribute the bitter battles to the Shiite militias' outside 
sponsors, which are at odds over the U.S.-backed Arab League peace initiative 
in the war-torn country. Last week's restoration of diplomatic ties between 
Syria and Egypt is also a complicating factor as Iran continues to pursue a 
political hard line on the Arab-Israeli issue while Cairo promotes moderation. 
</P>
<P>
Now, another player has entered the struggle in southern Lebanon. About 300 
Fatah guerrillas of Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization were 
deployed Wednesday on a hill outside the village of Kfar Hatta, between the two 
Shiite militia forces, in an apparent bid to prevent the fighting from 
spreading to the big Palestinian refugee camps of Ein el Hilwa and Miye ou Miye 
outside the southern port of Sidon. 
</P>
<P>
"Our deployment has no other political or military goals" beyond stopping the 
fighting, said Zaid Wehbeh, Arafat's top deputy in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
But combat among Shiite militias and Palestinians has pulsed repeatedly through 
Beirut and southern Lebanon, and this outbreak, the heaviest in years, has 
continued in defiance of appeals for a truce. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Shiite spiritual leader, 
condemned the conflict, which mocks a peace plan worked out last January by 
Amal and Hezbollah leaders summoned to Tehran, the Iranian capital. At stake is 
the control of Lebanon's estimated 1 million Shiites, who gained little from 
last September's Arab League peace accord, which has been largely blunted by 
the resistance of Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, the Christian strongman. 
</P>
<P>
Amal leader Nabih Berri, in a statement published Thursday in Beirut 
newspapers, complained that Syria had stopped supplying his militia when the 
fighting in the south broke out two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Syria cut off arms supplies to Amal after the first shot was fired in this 
war," the statement said. "I am being killed by Iranian bullets and rifles (in 
the hands of the rival Hezbollah)." 
</P>
<P>
The fighting is taking place in Iqlim el Tufah, literally "Apple Region," an 
area of poor Shiite villages stretching from the Sidon area southeasterly 
toward the Israeli border. Amal has been the traditional power in the south, 
but Hezbollah and the Palestinians both covet control of the region because of 
the access it provides for guerrilla operations against the Israelis in their 
security zone north of the border. 
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah forces seized control of five villages from Amal militiamen in the 
first 10 days of fighting. Last week, a cease-fire was proclaimed by Mohammed 
Ali Besharati, Iran's deputy foreign minister, but it broke down when Hezbollah 
fighters refused to withdraw from the captured villages.

President Bush will deliver his State of the Union address on Jan. 31 before a 
joint session of Congress, officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The address, which will follow by two days the submission of his proposed 
budget for the fiscal year, will be Bush's first formal State of the Union 
speech, although he spoke before both houses shortly after his inauguration 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Bush had planned to submit his proposed budget for fiscal 1991 on Jan. 22. But 
earlier this week Budget Director Richard G. Darman was forced to seek a 
seven-day delay because preparation of the fiscal plan was behind schedule.

HEALTH INSPECTIONS, PERMITS TO BE NEW TOOLS AGAINST CRACK HOUSES

People who want to make crack must get a permit and open their drug dens to 
health inspections or face fines of $10,000 a day under new regulations 
intended to help police gain entry to crack houses. 
</P>
<P>
The King County regulations take effect April 1, allowing time for them to be 
amended and maybe even scrapped after a review by prosecutors, said Charles 
Kleeberg, environmental health director for the county and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Kleeberg, a lawyer, said preliminary research indicated that no similar measure 
is on the books anywhere in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bud Nicola, director of the Seattle-King County Health Department, said 
health officials would be notified by police "that a crack operation was going 
on in a house." 
</P>
<P>
The department then would notify the owner of an apparent violation of health 
regulations and order him or her to produce a plan for reducing the health 
risk. A $100 review fee also is required. 
</P>
<P>
"We would not expect to get a plan," Nicola said. "We would then start the fine 
process." 
</P>
<P>
The measure, adopted Wednesday by the county Health Board, offers another way 
for police to gain entry to crack houses and gather evidence needed to close 
them, said Cynthia Sullivan, a County Council member who is chairwoman of the 
Health Board. 
</P>
<P>
"The Board of Health has far broader abilities in many cases to enter a 
residence than the police do," she said. "They don't have to have evidence of 
criminal activity. They only have to have evidence of unhealthful activity." 
</P>
<P>
The regulations were adopted despite requests by Robert Stier, a senior deputy 
prosecutor, and county police Maj. Jackson Beard for further review. Stier said 
he was not opposed to the measure but wanted to be sure it could withstand a 
court challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would apply outside the city of Seattle. About 500,000 of the 
county's 1.4 million residents live in the city, which is governed by a 
separate Health Board. A similar measure will be proposed in the city, 
officials said.

FDA APPROVES DRUG TO TREAT OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER

The Food and Drug Administration has given final approval to a drug to treat 
obsessive-compulsive disorder, a mental illness thought to afflict at least one 
in 40 Americans, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
FDA spokeswoman Eva Kemper said that the agency gave CIBA-Geigy Corp. of 
Summit, N. J., permission late last week to market clomipramine for use by 
people whose lives are seriously disrupted by obsessive-compulsive disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Kemper said that she did not know how many of the estimated 5 million Americans 
with the mental disorder -- marked by compulsive, repetitive acts like hand 
washing or floor scrubbing -- might benefit from the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Clomipramine, sold under the trade name Anafranil, has been available on a 
special case-by-case basis to U.S. patients since June, 1988. It is used in 
Europe to treat some patients with depression, Kemper said. 
</P>
<P>
The drug should be used in obsessive-compulsive disorder cases only when 
treatments like behavior modification have failed, Kemper said, noting that 
about 1.5% of the people who took the drug for a year suffered from seizures. 
Other side effects include dry mouth, drowsiness, constipation, increased 
appetite and impotence, she said. 
</P>
<P>
David Catlett, a spokesman for CIBA-Geigy, said he could not disclose how much 
clomipramine would cost or when it would be widely available. The company plans 
to hold a news conference Tuesday in New York to release marketing details. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Jenike, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical 
School, said that about 80% to 90% of the obsessive-compulsive patients he has 
seen require medication such as clomipramine. 
</P>
<P>
Jenike estimates that about 85% of people experience "some benefit" from the 
drug, a success rate he termed "quite remarkable." About 50% of the patients 
report their symptoms are much better after taking the drug, he said.

ENGINE FALLS OFF BUT JETLINER CARRYING 145 LANDS SAFELY; 
</P>
<P>
AIR TRAVEL: INCIDENT OCCURS OVER FLORIDA ON FLIGHT TO MINNEAPOLIS. GROUND 
SEARCH FAILS TO FIND 3,500-POUND COMPONENT.

The right rear engine fell off a Northwest Airlines Boeing 727 jetliner 
Thursday as it flew 35,000 feet above Florida, forcing the plane carrying 145 
people to make an emergency landing in Tampa. No one aboard was injured. 
</P>
<P>
The 3,500-pound engine, one of three on the aircraft, fell somewhere near Cross 
City, between Jacksonville and Tallahassee, airline officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Miller, a spokesman for the Minneapolis-based airline, said that 
officials will not know why the engine fell off until an investigation is 
completed. Safety investigators had not found the engine, which is 12 feet long 
and 4 feet in diameter, by late afternoon Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said that Flight No. 5 took off from Miami at 8:30 a.m. and was bound 
nonstop for Minneapolis with 139 passengers and a crew of six aboard. Northeast 
of Tallahassee, the pilot radioed air traffic controllers, informing them that 
he had lost an engine. The plane was diverted to Tampa and landed shortly 
before 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Weingartner, a passenger returning to Minneapolis from the Orange Bowl, 
said that the plane shook and he felt a bump similar to driving over a pothole 
in a road. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sitting next to the window, but it was cloudy at the time, so I didn't 
see anything," he said. "The captain came on and said that one of our engines 
had just failed -- he called it failed -- and he said there was no problem, 
that we could fly on two engines, but that they were going to take us down in 
Tampa." 
</P>
<P>
"The captain reported a compressor stall in engine 3, and that was the first 
indication of any trouble," Miller said, adding that the crew reported no 
unusual vibrations or steering problems as a result of the engine failure. 
"According to procedure, he attempted to restart that compressor. About that 
time, passengers in the rear of the cabin noticed a loud bang. That may have 
been when the engine separated from the plane." 
</P>
<P>
He said there was no evidence of an explosion and no report of major structural 
damage to the rest of the plane. "I saw pictures, and it looked like the engine 
made a clean break from the rest of the aircraft," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said that the plane was 14 years old, about average for Northwest's 
fleet. He said company officials were pulling together the plane's maintenance 
records for FAA officials and that there were no details on the engine's repair 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Fred Farrar said the engine loss in 
flight was the fifth such incident since 1983; it was the second involving a 
Boeing 727 and fourth involving a Boeing-made aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier 727 incident occurred on April 16, 1985, over Deming, N. M., Farrar 
said, noting that officials suspect the engine was struck by "blue ice." Blue 
ice is created by the fluid from a leaky lavatory, which freezes at high 
altitude and may be sucked into the engine compressors, stalling the engine. 
</P>
<P>
"The wrenching motion of the stalled engine may have torn the engine off," 
Farrar said. "We don't know for sure but that's what we suspect happened in 
that (previous) incident." 
</P>
<P>
In the two other incidents involving Boeing planes, the engine bolts were 
improperly fastened to the fuselage. Both involved Boeing 737s, with one mishap 
occurring Dec. 5, 1987, over Deptford, N. J., and the other Jan. 20, 1989, on 
takeoff at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, Farrar said. The fifth incident involved a 
Fokker-28 aircraft in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Augustine Calatrone, a passenger on the aircraft involved in Thursday's mishap, 
said that the plane shook briefly as though it had hit a turbulent air pocket. 
"It just stopped, like that. Then I think I felt shocks two or three more 
times. I was asleep. The only thing it did was wake me up. I thought it was 
just the wind," Calatrone said.

COURT UPHOLDS WARRANTLESS SEARCHES OF BARS 
</P>

<P>
A California Court of Appeal on Thursday upheld the power of state 
liquor-control agents to conduct warrantless searches of bars when they suspect 
illegal drug activity. 
</P>
<P>
The three-member panel unanimously rejected a claim that such searches were 
unconstitutional, ruling that investigators have broad latitude to inspect 
closely regulated commercial businesses, where there is less expectation of 
privacy than in a home. 
</P>
<P>
The court noted that state law mandates the revocation of liquor licenses of 
establishments that knowingly permit illicit drug sales, reflecting the 
Legislature's belief that such activity represents a public safety threat that 
must be combatted vigorously. 
</P>
<P>
"Violations of the law that can be quickly concealed, such as the sale of 
contraband, can only be deterred by frequent and unannounced inspections," 
Appellate Justice J. Anthony Kline wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, agents of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control have 
long been entitled to make unannounced inspections of licensee's premises to 
enforce liquor regulations -- but their authority to also look for drug 
activity knowingly permitted by licensees had come under recent attack. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's ruling was welcomed by state Deputy Atty. Gen. David D. Salmon as an 
important reaffirmation of the authority of the department to curb narcotics 
sales in licensed bars in California. 
</P>
<P>
"This power is necessary to help control this kind of social problem, and we're 
very gratified to receive it," Salmon said. "Without it, our ability would be 
considerably limited." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for a bar owner who challenged the search at issue in the case were 
not available for comment. Unless Thursday's ruling is overturned on appeal to 
the state Supreme Court, it will become binding on trial courts throughout 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The case arose after state liquor-control agents, acting on an anonymous tip, 
found 22 bindles of cocaine in the safe of the My House bar in San Francisco 
during a search of the premises in February, 1988. The owner, Lee Stewart 
Paulson, was convicted of possession of cocaine and sentenced to 90 days in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
In an appeal, Paulson challenged the validity of his conviction, contending 
that the agents exceeded their authority under state statutes and that their 
warrantless action violated the constitutional guarantees against unreasonable 
search and seizure. ABC investigators are empowered only to inspect for 
violations of liquor-control regulations, not search for illicit drugs, he 
asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Kline, in an opinion joined by Appellate Justices John E. Benson and J. Clinton 
Peterson, rejected Paulson's claims, pointing out that both the U.S. Supreme 
Court and California courts have approved warrantless searches of the premises 
of liquor licensees, firearms dealers and other businesses subject to close 
regulation by government. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the court said, evidence from warrantless searches may be used to revoke 
liquor licenses, or, as in Paulson's case, support criminal charges against a 
licensee involved in illicit drug activity. 
</P>
<P>
Such searches are permissible when they serve a "substantial government 
interest," further the state's regulatory purpose and are made where property 
owners are fully aware that they are subject to periodic inspections, the panel 
said. California's regulatory system meets all three requirements, the court 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kline noted that both drugs and alcohol are "intensely regulated" substances, 
are subject to abuse and addiction and are "attractive to many young persons 
and others who frequent licensed premises." 
</P>
<P>
"Trafficking in dangerous drugs is a particularized criminal act warranting 
special attention by those charged with enforcement of laws regulating the sale 
of alcoholic beverages," he wrote.

APPOINTEES WHO LIE WOULD BE REMOVED UNDER PROPOSED LAW

The chairwoman of the California State University trustees, who has admitted to 
claiming a false community college degree, could be removed from her post under 
legislation introduced Thursday to make sure governmental appointees tell the 
truth about their credentials. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara), chairman of the Senate Education Committee, 
said he wrote the proposed law in response to revelations last month that CSU 
Chairwoman Marianthi K. Lansdale incorrectly claimed a 1959 associate of arts 
degree from Long Beach City College when selected by Gov. George Deukmejian and 
confirmed by the Senate for a spot on the board. 
</P>
<P>
Lansdale publicly apologized for the claim after she acknowledged in a Times 
article that she never received the community college degree. 
</P>
<P>
Under Hart's bill -- which would apply retroactively to Lansdale and other 
gubernatorial appointees -- anyone chosen for a job that requires Senate 
confirmation can be removed if the appointee is found to have "knowingly 
(given) false information" during the confirmation hearings. Those hearings 
usually are low-keyed meetings that rubber-stamp the governor's selection. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also includes a provision that would require gubernatorial appointees 
to submit to the Senate an accurate record of their educational background -- 
in writing and under penalty of perjury. 
</P>
<P>
Hart said that he believes Lansdale should resign her post if she cannot come 
up with a "compelling case" why she falsely claimed the degree. "I think she 
should step down or else it sends the wrong message to the students," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lansdale and her husband, Long Beach developer William (Bit) Lansdale, are 
longtime supporters of Deukmejian and gave the governor more than $100,000 in 
donations and the use of a corporate airplane during his 1982 campaign, records 
show. She could not be reached for comment Thursday.

JUDGE'S DESIGN FOR PROBATION SUITS THIEF TO A T-SHIRT

<TEXT>
<P>
A Tulare man with a long criminal record avoided a prison term for stealing 
beer from a grocery by agreeing to wear a T-shirt that reads "I'm on Felony 
Probation. . . . My record plus two six-packs equal four years" at all times 
for a year. 
</P>
<P>
The shirt was designed by Visalia Superior Court Judge Howard Broadman, who in 
a hearing earlier this week also ordered Russell Allen Hackler, 29, to check in 
with the court daily and to attend three Alcoholics Anonymous meetings a week. 
</P>
<P>
Hackler's prior convictions include robbery, burglary and auto theft. 
</P>
<P>
Broadman said he did not want to impose another prison term. 
</P>
<P>
"I am horribly bothered by the prospect of spending $80,000 for putting you in 
prison for stealing these two six-packs of beer," the judge told Hackler. 
"(Regular) probation hasn't worked. And we have sent you to prison before." 
</P>
<P>
Broadman admitted that he was using humiliation to punish, as was done in 
Nathaniel Hawthorne's early American novel, "The Scarlet Letter," in which 
adulteress Hester Prynne had to wear a red "A." 
</P>
<P>
"If you are willing to be Hester Prynne for the next year, I am going to give 
you probation," the judge said.

Some players on the Senior PGA Tour feel they are being treated like 
second-class golfers this week in the MONY Tournament of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
The event is the only one in which the old-timers play concurrently with the 
regular PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
The seniors' major complaint is getting up before dawn to play in the early 
morning. There is also the matter of the tee markers. Some players, including 
defending champion Miller Barber, don't think they should be playing from the 
same tees as the "juniors." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the entire field of 20 seniors teed off before any of the other 
golfers began play in the first round of the tournament over the 7,022-yard La 
Costa Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Barber and Larry Mowry were scheduled to open the 72-hole event at 8:02 a.m. 
Fortunately for them, there was a 30-minute delay because of frozen greens. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the problems, there were some members of the 50-and-over set who played 
first-class golf. Bruce Crampton, fighting back from a strange double bogey on 
the first hole, and Bobby Nichols tied for the lead with one-under-par 71s. 
Barber and Butch Baird were at par, and four others -- Chi Chi Rodriguez, Don 
Bies, George Archer and Gene Littler -- had 73s. 
</P>
<P>
Crampton pushed his drive on the first hole into a tree in the right rough. The 
ball never came down. Crampton was able to identify the ball, so it was only a 
one-stroke penalty. He missed a six-foot bogey putt. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Crampton played the best golf of the seniors. He almost sank a sand 
wedge from 60 yards for an eagle on the sixth hole. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols, among the younger seniors at 53, said he was worn out at the finish. 
He was three under par after eight holes but finished with five birdies and 
four pars. 
</P>
<P>
Despite having a share of the lead, Crampton agreed with the criticisms of the 
early tee times. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was an affront to Miller, the defending champion," Crampton said. 
"He shouldn't have to start so early. If it was on television, I could 
understand it. We start early in the Vintage because of TV. The first two days 
we should start later, even if we started on No. 10." 
</P>
<P>
Barber wasn't happy with his 72, which included four birdies and a double bogey 
on the 450-yard, par-four 10th. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not right," he said. "The starting time is ridiculous, and the course is 
too long. Somebody apparently doesn't realize that we aren't competing with the 
guys on the regular tour. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the holes are just too long for us. Take the 10th. You have to hit a 
very long drive just to have a chance to reach in two. Most of us overswing and 
get into trouble. Yesterday, I hit a good drive, then a good two-iron, and I 
was still short on the fringe. Today, I pulled it into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like we are second-class citizens. Of course, it's just my opinion. I 
had to get up at 5:45. Ask some of the others." 
</P>
<P>
Mowry, who flew the 16th into mud with his second shot and a triple bogey that 
led to a 74, agreed with Barber. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been trying to tell them for a couple of years that the first two days 
we should not have to start early," Mowry said. "Almost all of us on the senior 
tour have arthritic problems. I have it in both shoulders and my neck. My 
doctor tells me to stay out of the cold weather." 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Palmer, who didn't win a tournament last year and didn't qualify for 
this event, finally won his battle over same tee placements for both groups. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Palmer and his playing partner, Harold Henning, used the regular 
tees on the second hole of the second round. They drew two-stroke penalties, 
and Palmer angrily chastised the PGA Tour for not using the same tees for both 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez refused to find fault, although his neck, which had not bothered him 
since September, was stiff and tight in the cold. "I don't have any complaint. 
We're just lucky to be around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They must be doing something right because we now have a $16-million tour. How 
can we complain? 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you one thing, though. If I reach the 10th hole on my second shot 
with an iron, I'll grow hair on my body."

IT'S CROWDED AT TOP OF LEADER BOARD; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: NORMAN, AZINGER AND BAKER-FINCH SHOOT 66 AS 17 BREAK PAR IN FIRST ROUND 
OF TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS.

<P>
After the first round of the first tournament of 1990, there were some familiar 
names atop the leader board at the Tournament of Champions at La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
There was also the name of a player who had won only one tournament on the PGA 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
Australian Ian Baker-Finch shared the lead Thursday with fellow Aussie Greg 
Norman and Paul Azinger, each shooting a six-under-par 66. 
</P>
<P>
Payne Stewart was one stroke away, and six players were grouped at 69. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, of course, is internationally famous. And Azinger, one of the bright 
young stars on the tour, was third on the money-winning list in 1989 with 
$951,649 in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, the PGA champion, earned $1,201,301 last year, the second-highest 
amount won on the tour in a season. 
</P>
<P>
As for Baker-Finch, he had only one top-10 finish in 1989, but it was 
noteworthy. He won the Southwest Bell Colonial tournament last May at a time 
when he didn't have his tour card. 
</P>
<P>
That victory gave him a two-year exemption on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly the best round I've played since the Colonial," Baker-Finch 
said. "A 66 was probably the lowest score I've had since then. It was certainly 
a great way to start the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year wasn't really a consistent year. I played through Dec. 20, trying to 
play my way out of a slump. But all in all I summed it up as a positive year. 
</P>
<P>
"Just knowing you can win on the tour is the nicest thing. Other guys play here 
for a long time and don't win and wonder whether they're good enough, or doing 
the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Baker-Finch is, of course, playing in a formidable field, 
comprising only winners of PGA Tour events last year, including the British 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
The weather was sparkling clear Thursday and even though the leaders said the 
7,022-yard course was playing long, 17 players were under par at 71, or better, 
with six at par 72. Norman said he was rusty, adding that he didn't have much 
enthusiasm after returning from Australia Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
"I only started to hit balls a couple of days before I came here," said Norman, 
who lives in Florida. "I think the players feel rusty. It's the first time I've 
arrived on a Monday to see that the driving range was full." 
</P>
<P>
Azinger, 30, is picking up where he left off last year, when he had a second 
and two thirds in his final three tournaments to earn $320,650 for a month's 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"I had 17 top-15 finishes in 26 events, so I was knocking on the door a bunch," 
he said. "And I know more about my golf swing. Now I'm trying to work on 
patience. That's a missing ingredient for me." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said that he played surprisingly well for the amount of preparation he 
has put into his game. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have any expectations about this week," said Stewart, who estimated 
that he'd had about a six- or seven-week layoff. 
</P>
<P>
He spent some of his leisure time skiing at Beaver Creek, Colo., with family 
and friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I was strictly on the green slopes," said Stewart, emphasizing his amateur 
status as a skier. 
</P>
<P>
He also spent three days with sports psychologist Dick Coop, who has worked 
with him for about a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said that Coop helps him with his pre-shot routine. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson? 
</P>
<P>
"The first shot on Thursday means as much as the last putt on Sunday," Stewart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who lost in a playoff to Tom Kite in the rich, season-ending Nabisco 
tournament last October at Hilton Head, S.C., said he isn't setting any goals 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Baker-Finch had six birdies and two bogeys in his round of 66. Norman had eight 
birdies along with a double bogey on the par five, 526-yard second hole. 
Azinger had seven birdies and a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Jones, the defending champion, had to settle for a par 72. Kite, the 
leading money-winner in 1989, shot a 73, and Curtis Strange, the two-time U.S. 
Open champion, had a 71. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Calcavecchia, the British Open champion, was in range of the leaders with 
a 70. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, the Great White Shark, plays on both the U.S. and Australian tours. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s were both rewarding and frustrating for him. 
</P>
<P>
He lost the British Open last year in a playoff with Calcavecchia and Wayne 
Grady. 
</P>
<P>
He lost the 1986 PGA championship when Bob Tway holed his bunker shot on the 
final hole. 
</P>
<P>
He lost the 1987 Masters in another playoff when Larry Mize sank a 140-foot 
chip shot on the second extra hole. 
</P>
<P>
As for the 1990s, the 34-year-old Norman said: "I'm glad the 1980s are over. 
It's a lot easier to throw away a decade in the mind than it is to throw away a 
week, a shot, or a month, or whatever. 
</P>
<P>
"Turning in the '90s seems like a breath of fresh air. You're looking down a 
clearer tunnel than some of things that happened in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I'm playing on the back nine of my career now. When the year 2000 comes 
around, it will be my decision to head off to the senior tour, or say, 'Hey', 
I've had enough of golf.' 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm excited about the next 10 years."

GLANVILLE INITIATES MEETING WITH FALCONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Glanville, whose coaching job with the Houston Oilers is rumored to be in 
jeopardy, met with officials of the Atlanta Falcons on Thursday to talk about 
their vacant head coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Smith, the Falcons' executive vice president, said the meeting was 
initiated by Glanville. 
</P>
<P>
"The Oilers gave Jerry permission to talk to other clubs, so he called us," 
Smith said in a statement released Thursday. "We've wanted to talk to all 
qualified people, and because Jerry's been a winner in the NFL, he fits that 
bill." 
</P>
<P>
Smith indicated no agreement was reached at the meeting, and said the Falcons 
plan to talk with other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Glanville said the meeting with Falcon officials was productive. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a good talk," he said. "We really haven't set anything else up. Really, 
that's all we're going to say." 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons have also interviewed two other candidates: Steve Spurrier, who 
accepted the University of Florida's coaching job Sunday, and Washington 
Redskin assistant Joe Bugel. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Bobby Hebert of the New Orleans Saints said he's not going away 
mad, but he is going away and can't think of anything that would persuade him 
to sign another contract with the team. 
</P>
<P>
"No chance," he said. "My family and I have talked it over, and we're moving 
on." 
</P>
<P>
Don't count on it, said Jim Finks, the Saints' president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
"Experience has taught me that feelings in January can change by training 
camp," Finks said. "Bobby will be protected by the Saints under Plan B. If he 
receives an offer from another NFL club, we will have the right to match that 
offer or take compensation in draft choices provided for under NFL rules." 
</P>
<P>
Hebert said that he has already begun moving to Palm Springs. "I'm looking for 
other options," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hebert finished the season with a 62.9 completion percentage, second only to 
Joe Montana's 70.2, and he had an efficiency rating of 82.7, fourth best in the 
NFC and sixth best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
His numbers were even better through the first half of the season, but he went 
into a slump and was replaced as the starter by John Fourcade for the last 
three games. 
</P>
<P>
Signing, not trading Eric Dickerson, is one of the off-season priorities of the 
Indianapolis Colts, said Jim Irsay, the team's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Irsay plans to meet with the NFL's No. 7 all-time rusher next week to discuss a 
contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson is under contract for next season. He was troubled by a hamstring 
injury for much of the season, missing a game for the first time in his seven 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive lineman Michael Dean Perry of the Cleveland Browns has gone on the 
offensive about his football card. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-1, 280-pound tackle said that he never gave authorization for his 
likeness being used on a football card and has sued the Topps Co., of Brooklyn, 
N.Y., and the National Football League Players Assn., in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Perry, 24, the younger brother of William Perry of the Chicago Bears, asked 
Topps and the NFLPA to stop producing and distributing the cards, to recall and 
destroy any cards already printed and to pay unspecified damages and any money 
the company and the association earned as a result of the sale of his card. 
</P>
<P>
They're playing a familiar tune in Denver this week, the old 
we-don't-get-any-respect number. 
</P>
<P>
Part of that can be traced to the relatively weak play of AFC teams, none of 
which is held in the same regard as the San Francisco 49ers or New York Giants 
of the NFC. 
</P>
<P>
Denver, which plays host to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC playoffs Sunday, 
is a major contributor to that state of affairs. The Broncos have lost twice by 
sizable margins in the Super Bowl. And despite finishing this season with the 
best record in the AFC, 11-5, the Broncos were beaten by the two best teams in 
the NFC East -- the Giants and Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
When Herschel Walker steps on the field at Candlestick Park Saturday, it will 
be the first playoff game of his four-year NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
But Walker, whose only pro playoff experience was with the New Jersey Generals 
of the old United States Football League, is more likely to be a sideshow than 
the main attraction in the NFC semifinal against the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"For us to have success, we have to revolve our game around Anthony Carter," 
Viking quarterback Wade Wilson said of the receiver who caught 10 passes for 
227 yards in a 36-24 win two years ago. "We went away from that, trying to get 
Herschel 20 carries a game. In turn, that got us away from our passing game."

HORSE RACING / JAY HOVDEY; 
</P>
<P>
LUNDY IS CONFIDENT OF A BIG SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jay Hovdey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Lundy is quietly confident that his second full season as trainer of 
the North American thoroughbreds owned by aerospace tycoon Allen Paulson will 
be even better than his first. If he's right, the current Santa Anita meeting 
will be the launching pad. 
</P>
<P>
Lundy, a native of Mt. Kisco, N.Y., assumed command of the vast Paulson stable 
in November 1988. After taking stock of his inventory, he decided that an 
accomplished French-raced 3-year-old named Blushing John could be successfully 
converted to American-style main-track competition. Score one for Lundy. 
</P>
<P>
Blushing John won four handicaps last year, including the Hollywood Gold Cup 
and the Pimlico Special, and ended the season by throwing a scare into Sunday 
Silence and Easy Goer in the Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream Park. The 
chestnut son of Blushing Groom led to well inside the final furlong and ended 
up third, beaten by just a length. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Blushing John is odds-on to be named best older horse Monday when 
the 1989 Eclipse Awards are announced. After eight years on his own as a 
trainer, this will be Lundy's first champion. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you how gratifying it will be if Blushing John receives the 
Eclipse," said the 41-year-old Lundy from his West Coast headquarters at 
Paulson's Brookside Farm in Bonsall. "I mapped out a plan before he even ran 
his first race last year. With only a couple of minor digressions, we stuck to 
it and it worked." 
</P>
<P>
Lundy hopes the next Blushing John will be another chestnut 4-year-old who 
spent his early career in Europe. His name is Opening Verse, a son of Epsom 
Derby winner The Minstrel, who began life as an $880,000 yearling. 
</P>
<P>
Opening Verse ended up in the thankless role of pacemaker for Sheikh Mohammed's 
better English horses, cutting out fast fractions for the likes of Indian 
Skimmer and Shaadi. The colt was purchased privately by Paulson late last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him win at York in his last race over there," Lundy said. "I felt 
immediately that he could be switched to dirt racing. He had the speed, the 
stride, the foot, everything you look for in a main-track horse." 
</P>
<P>
By now, racing fans have heard about Opening Verse's local debut in a one-mile 
allowance race last Sunday. His troubled trip has become such a mini-legend, 
you would think a piano had fallen on him at the eighth pole. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough loss," Lundy said. "I thought he should have won, but those 
things happen all the time. 
</P>
<P>
"We found out some good things about him, though. Being used as a pacemaker, he 
spent most of his time on the lead. But he showed me that he doesn't 
necessarily need the lead, he doesn't mind getting dirt in his face, and that 
he's an extremely game horse. The plan is to run him right back in the San 
Fernando." 
</P>
<P>
The 1 1/8-mile San Fernando Stakes on Jan. 14 is the first Grade I race of the 
North American season. Music Merci and Prized, both widely accomplished 
millionaires, will be waiting for the upstart Opening Verse that day. 
</P>
<P>
A victory by Opening Verse in the San Fernando would go a long way toward 
erasing the bad taste left by events on the same day last year. Paulson's 
promising colt Noble Minstrel, competing in a supporting feature that 
afternoon, broke his shoulder coming down the hillside turf course and had to 
be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Normally a reticent man in public, Paulson was incensed. Noble Minstrel, also 
by The Minstrel, was his best horse at the time. The owner fired a barrage of 
criticism at Santa Anita management for the condition of the turf course. 
</P>
<P>
"This course has never been much good, but now it's the worst in the country," 
Paulson said shortly after Noble Minstrel broke down. 
</P>
<P>
One day later, the track suspended all turf racing, resuming it only 
sporadically through the rest of the meeting. Then, during the off-season, a 
new course was installed that has met with rave reviews. Lundy, who was 
devastated by Noble Minstrel's fatal accident, prefers not to dwell on the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a terrible blow at the time," the trainer said. "There I was, only 60 
days in the new position, and we lose what I thought was our best horse. But 
Santa Anita should be commended on the job they did on the new course. I'm 
hoping to run quite a few Europeans here this winter." 
</P>
<P>
Lundy, a protege of Charlie Whittingham, will be spending most of his time with 
the horses at Brookside Farm, while assistant trainer Alex Hassinger handles 
their 12-horse string at Santa Anita. Lundy's hands are full with the 
development of no less than 60 Paulson 2-year-olds, most of them bred by the 
owner at his lavish Kentucky farm. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to race more in California this year," said Lundy, who operated out 
of New York in 1989. "The best thing about racing here is that you can give the 
horses a break from the racetrack routine by bringing them down here to the 
farm. Then, when you take them back to the track, they always seem to be a 
little more pumped up about running again. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Actor Jack Klugman's hot streak rubbed off on jockey Frank Olivares in 
Thursday's first race when the 40-year-old veteran won with the $32,000 
claimer, I Canon I Will. It was the first winner for Olivares since he broke an 
ankle last September at Fairplex Park. . . . I Canon I Will and her dam, Canon 
Copy, are four-legged advertisements for Klugman's major endorsement. Such 
overt commercialism in horse names is supposedly frowned upon by the Jockey 
Club, but how can anyone make a fuss when the Triple Crown has been bought by 
Chrysler and the Epsom Derby hawks EverReady batteries? 
</P>
<P>
After troubled losses with Opening Verse and then favored Samoan Wednesday, the 
Allen Paulson-Richard Lundy team finally got a clean trip in Thursday's 
feature. Unfortunately, Polar Gap was not up to the task and finished last 
after pressing the pace. . . . After winning Thursday's seventh race, Heaven 
for Bid dumped jockey Gary Boulanger while pulling up. The roan filly made a 
beeline for the winner's circle and was caught without a fuss.

Cornerback Lewis Billups of the Cincinnati Bengals was arrested on charges of 
carrying a concealed weapon and improperly handling a gun in his car, 
Cincinnati police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that two undercover officers saw Billups, 25, display a handgun in 
a vehicle Thursday in downtown Cincinnati. They put out a broadcast for 
Billups' arrest and the defensive back was stopped a few miles away in Ft. 
Wright, Ky., just outside Cincinnati. Billups was released from jail Thursday 
night after posting $500 bond. He was scheduled for arraignment this morning.

SMITH MAKES MARK WITH FRESH START FOR HUSKIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Safety Tommie Smith of the University of Washington football team has belied 
the notion that freshmen should be neither seen nor heard. 
</P>
<P>
The former Antelope Valley High standout was one of only three true freshmen to 
letter for the Huskies this season, and Smith concluded his first campaign by 
making the first interception of his collegiate career in the fourth quarter of 
Washington's 34-7 win over Florida in last Saturday's Freedom Bowl at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The game capped a season of change for Smith, who reported to the Huskies as a 
strong safety, but was moved to tailback when fall camp opened. A cartilage 
tear in his left knee and subsequent arthroscopic surgery kept Smith out of 
action until the fifth game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got hurt, it gave me the time to get mentally ready to play," Smith 
said. "I was laid back when I first came in. The time off helped me get my mind 
straight and know what to expect when I got back." 
</P>
<P>
When Smith returned, injuries had thinned Washington at strong safety, and he 
was moved back to that position. 
</P>
<P>
His collegiate debut proved to be a memorable one as he blocked a punt and 
returned it for a touchdown against USC at the Coliseum. In all, Smith played 
in seven games, almost exclusively on special teams, making eight tackles. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as I'm playing, I'm happy," said Smith, who led Antelope Valley to a 
28-22 victory over Canyon in the 1988 Southern Section Division II title game. 
"I'm not picky about where I play." 
</P>
<P>
Greener pastures: Brian Greenfield of the University of Pittsburgh, a former 
standout at Notre Dame High, was the 17th-ranked punter at the NCAA Division I 
level, averaging 41.7 yards a punt on 54 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
In Pitt's second game, against Boston College, he had a punt of 66 yards, and 
in the Panthers' victory over Texas A&amp;M in the John Hancock Bowl last week, 
the junior averaged 42.4 yards for five punts, including a 54-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
Greenfield, a converted soccer player, led the nation's junior college kickers 
with a 45.9 average at Glendale in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Making their mark: Adonis Jordan of Kansas and Kenny Hicks of Stanford were 
All-Valley basketball selections at Cleveland and Notre Dame highs last year, 
but they never met on the court until last Saturday, when the Jayhawks defeated 
the Cardinal, 83-61, for the championship of the Kansas tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Though neither of them have played starring roles, Jordan and Hicks are getting 
playing time in their first collegiate seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who averaged 18.5 points a game at Cleveland, is averaging 4.1 points 
and 2.7 assists, while playing 13 minutes a game for the second-ranked 
Jayhawks, who were 13-0 heading into Thursday night's game at Wichita State. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks, who averaged 16 points in high school, is playing 10 minutes a game and 
averaging 2.6 points for Stanford (8-1). 
</P>
<P>
Warming trend: Kris Brodowski of Cal State Northridge didn't exactly scorch the 
nets, but his three-for-five shooting performance against Biola on Wednesday 
might have signaled the end of his shooting slump. 
</P>
<P>
Brodowski had made two of 25 shots from the field in the Matadors' previous 
four games. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-6 senior missed all nine of his shots against Cal State Hayward, all 
four shots against Cal State Fullerton, was two for 10 against UC Davis, and 
zero for two against Sacramento State. 
</P>
<P>
Numbers game: With four seconds left in the semifinal basketball game of the 
Cougar Holiday Classic on Dec. 28, the scoreboard read: Utah Valley 92, Canyons 
89. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons had the ball beneath its own basket and appeared to have a chance to 
tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
But the official scorer had Utah Valley leading, 92-88, and a Provo radio 
station had the Wolverines ahead, 93-88. 
</P>
<P>
Both coaches and officials conversed at the scorer's table to discuss the 
discrepancy, but the 92-89 score was allowed to stand . . . for the moment. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons, however, was unable to get off a three-point shot and time expired. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the official score will go in the record books as 92-88. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we're going to go by," Canyons Coach Lee Smelser said. "I had no 
idea what happened on the scoring situation. It did open the door for us. 
</P>
<P>
"The scorekeeper lost a point somewhere, but we still haven't found out where. 
</P>
<P>
"All we know is we lost. The loss would have been much worse if we hit a 
three-point shot at the end and then found out." 
</P>
<P>
Hibernating: After a season-opening loss to Golden West College, the Canyons 
women's basketball team reeled off a school-record 12 victories -- including a 
win over El Camino, the top-ranked team in the state. 
</P>
<P>
But with starters Dominique Ice (sore hamstring) and Dawn Coleman (flu) 
suffering from injury and illness, that streak came to an end in last week's 
Fullerton tournament with losses to Yakima Valley (Wash.) and College of the 
Sequoias. 
</P>
<P>
"It was good for us to lose," Coach Jeff Dunlap said. "We started to get 
overconfident. We needed something to bring us down to earth and wake us up." 
</P>
<P>
If those losses failed to do the trick, perhaps a 72-67 loss to Valley on 
Wednesday did.

KEATING TAKES STAND AT LINCOLN S&amp;L HEARING; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE EMBATTLED FINANCIER APPEARS UNRUFFLED AS HE ARGUES THAT THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENCOURAGED S&amp;LS TO MOVE INTO NON-TRADITIONAL 
INVESTMENTS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Embattled Arizona developer Charles H. Keating Jr. defended his five-year 
operation of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Thursday, testifying that his firm 
bought the Irvine thrift to take advantage of deregulation laws he saw as the 
"salvation of the industry." 
</P>
<P>
Appearing relaxed and confident, Keating told U.S. District Judge Stanley 
Sporkin that he assembled a top-notch legal and accounting team to run Lincoln 
and to make sure the Orange County institution complied with federal and state 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Keating is now accused of systematically violating those rules and 
orchestrating risky investments that contributed to Lincoln's colossal failure 
last April. 
</P>
<P>
The flamboyant businessman has become a lightning rod for an industrywide 
debacle expected to cost taxpayers more than $200 billion. Lincoln's collapse 
alone could become the nation's biggest S&amp;L failure, with a potential 
cleanup cost of more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's testimony, which will continue today, came during the fifth day of a 
court hearing designed by Sporkin to test the evidence used by federal 
regulators to justify their April 14 takeover of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
The court hearing focuses on four transactions identified by regulators as 
representative of the failure of Lincoln's former parent firm, American 
Continental Corp. in Phoenix, to operate the S&amp;L safely and soundly and 
conserve assets. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection April 13, the day before 
the federal seizure. The company sued regulators a week later, claiming that 
they lacked sufficient evidence to show that Lincoln was being operated 
unsafely and unsoundly and was substantially dissipating assets, the grounds 
cited for the takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Sporkin is the first judge to review the merits of some of the longstanding 
differences between regulators and American Continental executives. And 
Keating, who has given only a handful of interviews since the collapse and 
refused to testify at a House Banking Committee hearing in November, appeared 
eager to tell his story in a court forum. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, however, he testified mainly about the years he spent in 
Cincinnati as a lawyer and a businessman and his arrival in Phoenix to take 
over a struggling home-building firm. He transformed that firm into American 
Continental and built it into one of the nation's largest home builders before 
buying Lincoln in early 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Keating said industry deregulation, which allowed thrifts to engage in risky 
transactions that previously had been off limits, prompted him to buy Lincoln. 
Deregulation was advocated by the Reagan Administration and approved by 
Congress in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the changes in the S&amp;L industry . . . as being the salvation of the 
industry," Keating testified, saying there was "government encouragement" to 
engage in land development and other non-traditional investments. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, he said, he used Lincoln to plan and partially develop large 
tracts of land, which the S&amp;L then sold to home builders for immediate 
construction or to land speculators who intended to cash in on the expected 
appreciation of the land. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln was a particularly good vehicle to engage in major undertakings such as 
land planning and development, Keating said, because it provided easy access to 
the large amounts of capital needed to finance the projects. 
</P>
<P>
But that capital came in the form of federally insured customer deposits, and 
regulators criticized Lincoln for using those funds on risky ventures -- 
especially without proper documentation showing that the deals were safe and 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
The two land deals that are part of the four transactions being reviewed by 
Sporkin were sales to land speculators, Keating said. As such, the deals were 
handled differently than normal loans. 
</P>
<P>
Keating testified that he had hired about 50 accountants throughout the company 
and had 15 lawyers on staff to make sure that Lincoln complied with state and 
federal thrift regulations.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / S.J. DIAMOND: CUSTOMER SERVICE BECOMES HARD TO DEFINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S.J. DIAMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Given the number of books and seminars, conferences and courses advertised 
these days, customer service seems a hot topic in business. It's a good way, 
say experts, to "differentiate" one's company from the crowded competition. Few 
really say what customer service is, beyond the implication that it's whatever 
they, or their clients, are offering. 
</P>
<P>
Given this past year's calls and letters from readers, even consumers seem 
unsure, although they at least try to define it, using words such as attention 
and care, helpfulness and even efficiency. Some confuse attitude with product, 
citing some new services that make comfortable urban lives more comfortable: 
vans that shuttle people from airport to home for a flat fee, home deliveries 
of restaurant dinners, parking lots that will wash cars left with them. 
</P>
<P>
What consumers do know is what's not good customer service. Indeed, it's said 
that two-thirds of the consumers who switch companies (whatever the business) 
switch because they didn't like the service. 
</P>
<P>
They know it's not fake "services" -- products and programs touted as serving 
customer needs but actually serving the purveyor, sometimes to the customer's 
detriment. It's not check "safekeeping," whereby a bank, to its own advantage, 
will no longer return canceled checks. But consumers don't want their checks 
held for them, with photocopies provided one at a time, after a long wait, and 
sometimes illegible when they're needed for taxes or bookkeeping or proof of 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
It's not phone company contracts for inside wiring repairs, often overpriced, 
rarely needed. It's not multiple yellow page books (another common complaint), 
either those of several competing companies, or those from just one company 
(business-to-business, business-to-consumer, maybe consumer-to-consumer). Hold 
all the "smart" products that sell more advertising: consumers want one big 
dumb yellow book containing everything. 
</P>
<P>
It may not even be the kind of high retail "service" made famous by 
Seattle-based Nordstrom stores and widely copied by its upscale competitors. 
Some consumers like being followed around and offered scarfs to match sweaters 
and ties to go with shirts. Others judge it an annoyance, born more out of a 
store's commission system than a wish to serve, and not always accompanied by 
other niceties. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, few seem to expect good customer service from department stores any 
more, though they still complain that the few salespeople present never leave 
the cash register (even at Sears, which boasted that its everyday-low-prices 
policy would free employees to provide floor service). No one expects help at 
supermarkets, and usually none can be found. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest criticism is drawn by banks -- high service businesses, which 
advertise service above all, and generally disappoint. Pick a bank line, any 
bank line: half the people on it are muttering about switching banks and half 
are muttering that this is the bank they switched to. And however long the 
lines, none of the desk officers move to help out behind the counter. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer complaints about such businesses show clear understanding that service 
is not a what but a how -- company philosophy reflected in front-counter 
attitude. If two-thirds switch because of poor service, two-thirds of those 
mention rudeness -- of tellers, salespeople, even dentists and their assistants 
conducting private conversations while waiting on them, of doctors, lawyers, 
hairdressers taking phone calls during their visit. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer's main concern, however, is lack of performance. It seems odd that 
one must point out that customer service involves actually performing the 
service offered, and performing it with care. And yet most photo developers run 
films through a machine, uninspected by the human eye, and let the consumer 
find and bring back the duds (that's today's "quality control"). 
</P>
<P>
Magazine subscription services take orders and then refer customers to the 
magazine itself when the subscription doesn't start or suddenly stops. 
Retailers, both discount and full service, sell small appliances, jewelry, even 
handbags, and refer consumers to the manufacturer when there's a defect. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes what consumers think a matter of basic service, business considers an 
extra, unnecessary or impossible to provide. It took government regulation to 
make seat belts standard equipment in vehicles. Banking customers want better 
or at least some security at ATMs; instead, banks produce surveys showing that 
relatively few customers are killed, injured or robbed, considering the 
millions of ATM transactions. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a real customer service -- and not an unreasonable demand -- if 
credit reporting bureaus would devise some way to check and guarantee the 
accuracy of all the information they file on consumers and then sell to 
creditors. And newspapers, magazines and broadcasters, which say they can't 
check the truth of every ad they carry, could establish procedures to help 
consumers who may have been deceived by one. 
</P>
<P>
Airlines can certainly keep a half dozen, even a dozen infant seats on every 
plane to guarantee the safety of traveling babies -- a current public concern. 
But who will fight for it? Consumers no longer seem to expect much service from 
airlines: They can't even get seats at the advertised rates. 
</P>
<P>
Good customer service may not even take a lot of people and a lot of handling. 
Some businesses often mentioned for helpful and efficient service are self 
service (Toys R Us is one, Builders Emporium another). 
</P>
<P>
It may not require people at all. One real banking service today is the 24-hour 
phone line, often computerized, whose existence recognizes that many people do 
their bank business at night and that they're wise to do so. This is the 
ultimate customer service, helping the consumer stay away from the business 
entirely and do as much as possible, easily, for himself.

BABY BELLS FEEL HEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pacific Bell, GTE California and the state's 20-odd other local phone companies 
still enjoy virtual monopolies in their respective service areas. But that is 
changing -- in ways that promise to revolutionize the way consumers and 
businesses buy and receive phone service. 
</P>
<P>
In the same way that giant American Telephone &amp; Telegraph has lost market 
share to smaller upstarts in the long-distance business, a handful of 
entrepreneurial competitors are asking regulators to open local phone markets 
further to competition. That will enable them to cash in on a growing business 
and chip away at the market shares enjoyed by Pacific Bell and other local 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
So far, such increased competition is minimal. But the prospect of its growth 
was a major factor cited by Pacific Telesis on Thursday in announcing that it 
will cut 16% of its work force in the next five years, mostly in its Pacific 
Bell unit. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the next five years, it's etched very keenly in everybody's minds 
that we have to do this to remain competitive," said Pacific Telesis 
spokeswoman Amy Damianakes. 
</P>
<P>
An example of the new breed of competitor is Metropolitan Fiber Service, a 
2-year-old private venture that offers local connections to big business in a 
dozen U.S. cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"Our competition today is in what is designated as special access only, a very 
small part of the total access (provided by) the Bell operating companies," 
said George Tronsrue, a vice president of Metropolitan Fiber Systems. 
</P>
<P>
Its local links connect major telecommunications users, such as brokerages and 
other financial institutions, to the long-distance carriers of their choice, 
bypassing local public networks run by Pacific Bell and other local phone 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan Fiber Systems, based in the Chicago suburb of Oakbrook, Ill., 
installs its switching system in the heart of a major metropolitan area -- 800 
W. 6th St. in Los Angeles. Then it extends high-capacity, high-fidelity optical 
fiber strands to connect surrounding buildings to one another, creating its own 
local network. This in turn is hooked to the nearby switching machines of such 
long-distance carriers as AT&amp;T, MCI, US Sprint and the more than 100 other 
more specialized long-haul companies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a small niche, but a viable business for us," Tronsrue said. "But when 
you look at what else is there, there is a significant portion of local-access 
service that we are precluded from developing." 
</P>
<P>
Building a tiny niche into a big business mirrors the genesis two decades ago 
of MCI, which began by handling private traffic by microwave between St. Louis 
and Chicago and parlayed that into opening the entire long-distance 
telecommunications market to competition. 
</P>
<P>
Now federal and state regulators are begining to lighten their control over 
AT&amp;T, which has watched its former long-distance monopoly shrink to a 
two-thirds share of the market. At the same time, MCI and US Sprint have grown 
into billion-dollar concerns themselves, and both now are also profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Metropolitan Fiber Systems has asked federal authorities to let it broaden 
its entry into local telecommunications. It seeks the right to plug its private 
customers into the Baby Bells' local networks, paying just for the part of 
local service that it needs to complete its own system.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: WHEN A MERGER CAN BE IN YOUR BEST INTEREST 
</P>

With sales reaching $3 million and a host of intriguing new opportunities for 
its security systems and products, Carson-based Martec Controls Systems needed 
cash to expand. The principals, Jim Power and Mario Marinaccio, had worked 
together on security systems at four major corporations but had just recently 
gone into business on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Although they were skilled in developing high-tech security systems, they were 
unsure about how to write a business plan to attract new capital. The Martec 
founders assumed that they were looking for venture capitalists to help them 
out, but they found exactly what they needed by merging with a larger, public 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
And although selling out wasn't what they had intended to do, Power said 
Martec's solution may apply to other small-business owners anxious to expand 
their operations. 
</P>
<P>
"We met with several venture capitalists, but 90% of them wanted to own the 
store," said Power. He said he and his partner needed money to expand, but they 
definitely wanted to remain at the helm of their business. Martec's answer came 
in the form of CCX, a publicly traded building materials company based in 
Bridgewater, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
"They checked us out and were convinced that we have a . . . light touch and 
let people run their own show," said Martin Stone, chairman and chief executive 
of CCX. 
</P>
<P>
"The CCX management team was made up of our kind of people," said Power. "They 
were not tied totally to the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
This successful match was made by two Southern California investment bankers 
who specialize in helping small-business owners. Bruce Juell of Palos Verdes 
and Frank Kilpatrick of Manhattan Beach introduced Martec to CCX. 
</P>
<P>
Juell, formerly head of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc.'s corporate finance 
department, also lined up several venture capitalists interested in investing 
in Martec. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly three months of discussion, Martec turned down a 
multimillion-dollar offer from an international venture capital group in favor 
of merging with CCX, which expects sales of about $65 million this year. 
Martec's principals sold the business to CCX in October for an undisclosed 
amount of cash and stock options. They also agreed to stay on for several years 
to run the company. 
</P>
<P>
CCX's Stone said the deal not only provides Martec with the cash it needs to 
grow, but offers CCX a new business with enormous growth potential. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, we think the Martec business is the one with the glamour and the 
explosive growth potential," said Stone, who studied about 3,000 firms and 
acquired 29 while building Monogram Industries into a $500-million Santa 
Monica-based conglomerate in the 1960s. He has sold his interest in Monogram to 
Rhode Island-based Nortek Inc. in 1982 and is trying to slow down and enjoy 
life on his horse ranch in Lake Placid, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Stone said CCX brought more to Martec than traditional venture capitalists who 
are usually "from the financial world and don't understand the marketing, 
manufacturing and operational sides of a business." 
</P>
<P>
One of the first things CCX did for Martec was to establish stricter financial 
controls and straighten out the company's books. 
</P>
<P>
"We stepped in and provided them with quite a bit of working capital, brought 
their accounts current and provided longer range capital for developing new 
products," Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, Stone said he envisions developing new building security 
products that would combine CCX's window screens and fiberglass mesh with 
Martec's electronic security systems. (According to Kilpatrick, the annual U.S. 
market for electronic systems and devices is about $3 billion and is growing at 
a rate of about 10% a year.) 
</P>
<P>
So far, Power said, he is extremely pleased with Martec's new parent company. 
With help from CCX executives, Martec has created a seven-year business plan 
that outlines how much money Martec needs each year from CCX to reach its 
goals. Each month, CCX and Martec executives review Martec's results. They plan 
to meet quarterly for a more in-depth review.

Weekend Forum in L.A. Takes a Look at Franchising 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department predicts that franchising will be the leading method of 
doing business in the 1990s. Already 7.3 million Americans are working at 
510,000 franchised outlets, according to the International Franchise Assn. in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
If you are interested in exploring the latest franchise opportunities, the 
association is hosting a "World of Franchising" exposition Saturday and Sunday 
in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 franchised business opportunities representing 40 industries are 
slated to be presented at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel, 404 S. Figueroa St. The 
exposition will run from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $6 for adults, while 
children under 16 will be admitted free. 
</P>
<P>
EXAMINING A MERGER 
</P>
<P>
Here is some advice for entrepreneurs considering merging with a larger firm: 
</P>
<P>
Learn as much as you can about the company from public sources, colleagues and 
others. Is it run by people you can work with? Does it have a business plan and 
a direction that is simpatico with what you are doing? Does it have the 
resources and financial backing to help you? Is it well financed for growth? 
Can your business contribute to its corporate structure? 
</P>
<P>
If you have an attorney or accountant, ask him to approach the company on your 
behalf. Or hire a reputable business broker to represent you. 
</P>
<P>
Market your business yourself by preparing a clear, concise presentation that 
includes detailed financial data, product lists, catalogues and descriptions of 
your management team.

REPORTS ON DROPOUTS MET WITH SKEPTICISM; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: NEW COMPUTERIZED ATTENDANCE RECORD SYSTEM IN CENTINELA VALLEY UNION 
HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT SHOWS DRAMATIC DECREASE IN THE DROPOUT RATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Figures released by the Centinela Valley Union High School District that show a 
significant decrease in the dropout rate over the last two years have caught 
three school board members by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
A state report released on Dec. 4 said the overall dropout rate for grades 10, 
11 and 12 for the 1986-87 school year was 16% at Hawthorne High School and 
11.9% at Leuzinger High School. 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, Centinela administrators released figures that showed the 
dropout rate for 1987-88 was 14.6% at Hawthorne and 11.5% at Leuzinger. The 
dropout rate took a further dive to 8.9% at Hawthorne and 5.7% at Leuzinger in 
1988-89, according to the district. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. McKinley Nash said the decrease can be attributed to a number of factors, 
including a new computerized attendance reporting system, which keeps more 
accurate dropout figures, as well as several special programs aimed at keeping 
students in school. 
</P>
<P>
Three school board members said the new dropout numbers have caught them by 
surprise, and two of them questioned the accuracy of the district's figures. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anything about a special program that has reduced (the dropout 
rate) so dramatically," said board member Jacqueline Carrera, who was elected 
in November. "If it's true, we should be marketing this." 
</P>
<P>
Another new board member, Pam Sturgeon, said she is not convinced that the 
district's dropout rates could have dropped so much in such a short time. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned I don't feel they're accurate," said Sturgeon, who 
said she also suspects that the dropout rates from previous years were too 
high. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Ruth Morales said she is also skeptical about the accuracy of 
the district's dropout figures and said she would like to study the numbers 
further. 
</P>
<P>
"I have problems giving out reports that we have performed miracles" in such a 
short time, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The other two board members, Amparo Font and Michael Escalante, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
James Fulton, educational demographics manager for the state Department of 
Education, said he could not comment specifically on the Centinela district, 
but it is possible for dropout numbers to change dramatically when a district 
switches to a new attendance keeping system. 
</P>
<P>
The dropout rate was a major point of debate during the November school board 
elections. During the campaign, Sturgeon, an accounts analyst, and Carrera, an 
accountant, both criticized the district dropout rate and said they would like 
administrators to study ways to reduce it. 
</P>
<P>
Sturgeon, Carrera and Font, a bilingual teacher, won the three board seats, 
replacing incumbents Ann Birdsall, Aleta Collins and Herbert D. Bartelt. 
</P>
<P>
Nash dismissed the skepticism and the questions about accuracy. "The numbers 
are there," he said. "Talk to the principals. I don't compile them." 
</P>
<P>
He said the dropout problem is at "epidemic proportions" in schools throughout 
the country, but he said Centinela officials have been making an extra effort 
to address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Nash said the new computer system the district introduced this year to keep 
attendance records at the two high schools has produced a dropout rate that is 
more accurate and lower than previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
The system keeps attendence records and transfer information on computer files 
so that school officials can more quickly and more accurately monitor students 
who transfer in and out of the district, he said. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said part of the reason it is difficult to keep accurate 
dropout figures is because about half of the student population enters or 
leaves the district each year. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Gilliam, associate principal at Leuzinger High School, said the dropout rate 
has been significantly reduced through several programs created by the Students 
at Risk Committee, a group of 14 teachers, administrators, department heads and 
clerical workers, which was formed 2 1/2 years ago to tackle the dropout 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
The group meets once a month to discuss ways to keep students from leaving 
school, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the programs designed by the committee is a work-training program that 
enrolls students in vocational and technical training courses at the South 
Coast Regional Occupational Center in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
In September, most of the 600 students in that program were absorbed into the 
district's Jobs for America Graduates program, a highly touted work-training 
and job-placement plan used in 280 other schools in 14 states. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago the committee also created the Mathematics Video Program, which 
lets students check out video tape recordings of teachers explaining 
mathematics lessons, Gilliam said. The program is advantageous, he said, 
because it allows students with math problems to take as much time as needed to 
study math lessons at home. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also established a program requiring truant students to attend 
school on Saturday to make up for missed class time, he said. Gilliam said the 
truancy program provides a deterrent for students who are regularly truant. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy M. Nuesseler, president of the 200-member Centinela Valley Secondary 
Teachers Assn., said she too is skeptical of the dropout figures because she 
believes the programs aimed at reducing the dropout rate have not had enough 
time to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know what the programs are accomplishing," she said. "We are 
not given any feedback from the district." 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Steachowiak, president of the Centinela Valley Council PTA, said she is 
happy to hear about the reduced dropout rates but is concerned that the 
district is not paying enough attention to college-bound and special education 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of needs out there for the kids that I feel haven't been met," 
she said. Steachowiak has a son who graduated from Hawthorne High School last 
year and now attends El Camino College and another who graduated three years 
ago from the district's special education program. 
</P>
<P>
Nash said the district's efforts to reduce the number of dropouts have not been 
at the expense of college-bound students. He said the district has many 
successful programs aimed at getting students into college and added that he 
has been criticized by some teachers for putting too great an emphasis on 
college preparation. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Crowe, principal of Hawthorne High School, said he is not surprised by the 
lower dropout rates, because he believes the dropout figures the district has 
been using in the past were not accurate. 
</P>
<P>
He said the new computer system is providing the district information about 
dropouts that is "much more accurate and realistic." 
</P>
<P>
Crowe said he is confident the dropout rate will continue to decrease with the 
help of other programs the district has implemented, such as the Truancy 
Abatement Program. Under this program, Hawthorne police officers pick up truant 
students they encounter during routine patrols and return them to the school. 
</P>

a decrease in the district's dropout rate in the past two school years.

REALLY BIG SHOE;

<P>
FASHION: WHEN 7-FOOT CENTER DON PECK JOGS ONTO THE CYPRESS COLLEGE BASKETBALL 
COURT IN HIS SIZE 20 NIKES, THE CROWD KNOWS IT IS IN FOR A . . .

<P>
The next reserve center on the Cypress College basketball team will have big 
shoes to fill -- Size 20s, to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
Seven-foot Don Peck of Cerritos, a soft-spoken engineering student, owns one 
pair of handmade, $650 brown dress shoes that he wears on special occasions. He 
knocks around campus and works part time in extremely rare, large-sized Nike 
basketball shoes costing $80 to $150. 
</P>
<P>
The husky freshman, 20, who's never met anyone with shoes as large as his, said 
that people have talked about his feet all his life and that he's comfortable 
with the attention, but there are limits. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of my friends will kid around," he said. ". . . If someone starts talking 
and wants to get friendly and asks how big my shoes are, that's no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
"(What) I don't like (is) when it's mean. If somebody wants to sit there and 
joke about it, it makes me mad and I'll look at them mean. . . . Frankly, I 
don't think it's any of their business if they want to make me a sideshow." 
</P>
<P>
Their tiresome remarks include: 
</P>
<P>
"Don't hurt him. He might step on you." 
</P>
<P>
"You don't need skis. Just go on the mountain and ski yourself." 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, he can stomp out forest fires with those." 
</P>
<P>
"God, he's bigger than Bigfoot." 
</P>
<P>
Peck's sensitivities are understood at Brooks Orthopedic and Custom Made Shoes 
in Los Angeles, where Sarkis Papikian made Peck's dress shoes and said they 
were the largest he's fitted in 12 years. The Armenian immigrant, who began 
shoemaking 45 years ago, took a day to fashion a wooden mold before stitching 
the footwear. Peck's mother, Winifred, said the shoes were short so her son 
returned for refitting. 
</P>
<P>
"It fits really well now," said Mrs. Peck, who called all around the country to 
find a store with Size 20 dress shoes in stock before locating Papikian. 
</P>
<P>
"But I feel bad because he doesn't have a selection. He likes to go to dances 
and it would be nice if he could have a pair (of dress shoes) in black, maybe, 
or some loafers or a pair of slippers. But at that kind of price, you can't 
afford several pair." 
</P>
<P>
Basketball shoes are easier to get because Peck often finds a ready supply at 
Sam Lichtenstein's Tenni-Mocs in Long Beach. Peck said it was almost impossible 
to find his size until he started dealing with Lichtenstein several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Nike makes a limited amount of Size 20s and is very selective where they place 
them," Lichtenstein said. "I do a lot of threatening and a lot of groveling to 
keep these sizes in stock. We have to pound doors and write letters and get our 
sales rep to get his two cents through. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Lichtenstein said two other customers who wore 20s moved away so he had four 
pairs of 20s on his shelves last week, but, in the past, Peck has waited as 
long as six months for shoes on order. 
</P>
<P>
Lichtenstein said Peck's basketball playing is hard on the shoes, and Cypress 
Coach Don Johnson called Peck one of his hardest workers. While Peck is not 
ready for the National Basketball Assn., he would be a league leader in shoe 
size. 
</P>
<P>
Former Detroit Piston and Milwaukee Buck Bob Lanier wore what many regard as 
the largest shoes in the modern era, Size 22 Adidas. The Basketball Hall of 
Fame in Springfield, Mass., displays the shoe, which gained enough notice that 
Lanier recently filmed a commercial playing off his athletic "feets." Lanier's 
German Adidas were not equivalent to American shoes, however, for he wore Size 
19 or 20 Converse. 
</P>
<P>
Among current players, 7-foot-1 Chicago center Will Perdue wears a Size 21. 
Trainers for the Lakers and Clippers know no one with comparable feet. The 
Lakers' retired 7-foot-2 center, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, played in 17s. Seven-foot 
Benoit Benjamin of the Clippers uses 16s while 6-foot-10 teammates Joe Wolf and 
Danny Manning perform in 15s. At 6-foot-9, Magic Johnson and James Worthy of 
the Lakers wear 14 1/2s. 
</P>
<P>
Peck is not sure what put him into the stratosphere of shoe sizes, but his 
father, Don, who runs a family business, wears a 13 and his mother is a Size 
12. He has no brothers or sisters. Sometimes, however, the unusual shoes are 
beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially when I'm talking to a girl," he said. "Most will notice me because 
of my height. Then they'll look me over and notice my feet. It breaks the ice." 
</P>

REMARRIAGES ARE CREATING COMPLEX FAMILIES WITH PROBLEMS 'THE BRADY BUNCH' NEVER 
FACED

It was Brandy Van Zitter's elementary school graduation, a seemingly 
commonplace family celebration. Since she became part of a stepfamily, however, 
it took 2 1/2 years of putting hurt feelings aside and learning to cooperate 
before getting two biological parents, two stepparents, and a variety of aunts, 
uncles and cousins in the same room at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The turning point wasn't lost on the youngster. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be lonely, having parties without one of my parents. Graduation 
made me feel good, because my parents could be on good terms, not like before, 
when they used to argue a lot," said Brandy, 12. With sister Kelly, 10, she 
shuttles between the Corona home of her mother and stepfather, Louise and Roy 
Van Broekhuizen, and the Cerritos residence of her father and stepmother, Peter 
and Ceci Van Zitter. 
</P>
<P>
Like growing numbers of American youngsters, Brandy and Kelly are navigating 
stepfamily life. Some experts believe as many as one-third of all children born 
in the 1980s may live with a stepparent before reaching age 18. 
</P>
<P>
But determining just how many of today's children are stepchildren is 
problematic because there are no statistics on "unofficial" stepfamilies, where 
a child's biological parent lives with a new partner without marriage. However, 
surveying married couples, demographer Paul C. Glick of Arizona State 
University found that 8.78 million children under age 18, or nearly 1-in-5, 
live in stepfamilies. 
</P>
<P>
Once, social scientists believed these remarried families resembled nuclear 
families. However, as researchers and clinicians shed light on today's 
stepfamilies, what emerges is a highly complex family forum, with members 
sometimes struggling for years to forge relationships and negotiate between 
households. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised at how long it takes (stepfamilies) to work things out. In 
most stepfamilies, there are enduring differences in parent-child relationships 
and how children relate to stepparents," says James H. Bray, associate 
professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who for nearly seven years 
has conducted a longitudinal stepfamily study. 
</P>
<P>
Although many describe being part of a stepfamily as a rewarding experience, 
most agree it rarely resembles "The Brady Bunch." 
</P>
<P>
Consider the obstacles. In first marriages, adults have time to gradually come 
to know each other, resolve differences, prepare for the birth of each child, 
and develop family routines and philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, "in a remarriage with children, you are bringing two cultures 
together," says clinical psychologist Patricia Papernow, a stepfamily 
specialist in Cambridge, Mass. "All of a sudden you are slammed together. 
Everything is up for grabs, from how you celebrate Christmas to the size of the 
kids' allowances, how much television viewing is appropriate and whether it's 
OK to leave wet towels on the bathroom floor. 
</P>
<P>
"These seemingly small details are the threads holding our daily lives 
together, and it feels as though our lives are unraveling." 
</P>
<P>
Mental health professionals believe many of these difficulties are avoidable. 
Through increased education, therapists and researchers maintain, stepfamily 
relationships can improve greatly. 
</P>
<P>
Here are seven problem areas stepfamilies may wish to be aware of, which 
emerged from interviews with experts and stepfamilies nationwide: 
</P>
<P>
One big happy family: Whether through divorce or death, therapists note, 
stepfamilies are born out of loss. Adults dream of blissful marital happiness, 
a magical "blending" of two families, with members instantly loving one 
another. Children, on the other hand, fantasize about reuniting biological 
parents or returning to the days of sharing a close relationship with a single 
parent. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than forcing constant togetherness, experts report, many of the most 
successful stepfamilies preserve individuality. 
</P>
<P>
"If you find a family that's 'blended,' someone got creamed," says psychologist 
Papernow, who thinks family members need time apart, even if the breaks are 
small. Couples should spend some time away from children; biological parents 
need one-to-one time with each child; stepparents need individual time with 
each stepchild; and stepsiblings need activities without parental involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Shaping up the kids: A prevalent myth, therapists agree, is that the new couple 
should provide a united front and act as instant parents to each other's 
children. Actually, this may be the worst approach, because "it takes many 
children a long time to accept stepparents as active parents," said Bray of the 
Baylor College of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"My research indicates the most important thing stepparents can do, from the 
beginning, is function like an aunt or baby-sitter. Discipline should be left 
to the biological parent," said Bray. 
</P>
<P>
In this stage, Papernow advises, Mom or Dad should sit down with the kids and 
explain, "You know my rules, and when I am not here, it is up to your 
stepdad/mom to see that you follow my rules." 
</P>
<P>
If a child balks at a stepparent and claims, "You aren't my (biological) dad, I 
don't have to listen to you," the stepparent should reply, "You are absolutely 
right, I am not your parent. But I am the adult in the house and you do have to 
follow house rules." 
</P>
<P>
In a few years, Bray said, once the relationship is developed, the stepparent 
can become more involved in active parenting and discipline. 
</P>
<P>
Stepmothers: Cinderella aside, most stepmothers want to be good moms. However, 
"it is difficult for men to understand that women don't naturally take to this 
role," said Los Angeles marriage and family therapist Carol Samuels, who with 
husband Gary Hinte is co-president of the Los Angeles chapter of the Stepfamily 
Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
In our culture, experts note, stepmothers are expected to play a major role in 
raising someone else's children, a difficult task. 
</P>
<P>
"Your (biological) children can be misbehaving in the identical fashion, but 
it's far more annoying when your stepkids do it," says Judy McMahon of Anaheim, 
mother of Scott, 17, and Melanie, 14, and stepmother to husband Larry's 
children, Bridget, 10, and Brianne, 7. 
</P>
<P>
Commonly, men expect new wives to assume all the work of caring for children. 
For many women, research indicates, this is a major source of marital 
dissatisfaction, leading to divorce. 
</P>
<P>
"The stepmother feels he married her to (make her) a slave," Samuels says. 
</P>
<P>
Since no one can be forced to love another, experts point out, stepmothers 
shouldn't be pressured to show affection for children. In addition, "if neither 
child nor the stepmother wants to be close, that is OK," as long as children 
and adults are able to be civil and cooperative, Papernow says. 
</P>
<P>
The marriage: Faced with financial difficulties of expanding a family, warfare 
between two sets of children, and scheduling of school conferences, soccer 
games, and Brownie meetings, most newlyweds report constant stress. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got married, we said we would never let the sun set on our anger," 
said Ginger Davis of Silver Springs, Md., who has been part of a stepfamily 
involving five children for 13 years. "We gave that up after about two months 
of staying up all night talking things out. 
</P>
<P>
"Our relationship took major bumps and setbacks each time one of the kids came 
to live with us," Samuels said of her two stepchildren, now grown. "My stepson 
is a very good kid, but when he moved in, the demands he put on his father's 
time started killing our relationship. There was always some pressing topic. I 
remember waking up at 6 a.m., listening to them having a long conversation 
about computers, in our bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
Although the tendency is to devote all time and attention to children, Bray's 
study indicates one of the most important things couples can do is take time to 
form a close marital bond. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a solid marital relationship, it is much harder to agree about kids," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
Couples need time alone, "even if all they have time for is sharing a pizza in 
front of 'L.A. Law,' " Papernow says. 
</P>
<P>
When their children were younger, Samuels and husband Gary Hinte needed more 
time off for a real vacation. "It took two or three days to stop arguing about 
the kids and just loosen up," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Household routines: When clinical psychologist Emily Visher and psychiatrist 
husband John married 30 years ago, each had four children. Based on personal 
experience, as well as that of countless stepfamily clients, the Vishers 
developed strategies for at-home survival for themselves and their eight 
children ranging in age from 5 through 16. 
</P>
<P>
Remarriage, Emily Visher notes, begins with two distinct housekeeping styles. 
One family may be used to doing dishes together, while the other takes turns. 
In one household, kids were allowed to drop backpacks on the living room floor; 
in the other, spilling popcorn on the rust-colored carpet was regarded as a 
major sin. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, the fewer things you change, the better," says Visher. 
"Choose a few rules that are most important to you, such as the children must 
knock before entering your bedroom, and the dishwasher must be emptied each 
day, and let the rest go." Visher and her husband co-founded the Stepfamily 
Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
If children are beyond toddlerhood, the family should meet, draw up a list of 
tasks and request volunteers. The chart, posted on the refrigerator, can change 
weekly or monthly. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperative behavior should be rewarded, Visher says. The child completing the 
most chores is entitled to a treat, such as going to a movie, playing a game 
with a parent or having a friend spend the night. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrations: Comparing formal rituals, Visher says, is an excellent way for 
families to become acquainted. 
</P>
<P>
"You should never reject what people have done before (remarriage)," she says. 
Her stepchildren continue to spend Christmas Eve and morning at their mother's 
and Christmas night with their father, opening gifts after dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, it is important for the stepfamily to add new customs, such 
as cutting their own tree or baking cookies together, because it is the 
building of traditions that makes people feel part of a group," Visher added. 
</P>
<P>
Making arrangements with the other household may be difficult. However, Visher 
admonishes, "the adults, (keeping children's wishes in mind), need to do the 
negotiating, never forcing children to choose." 
</P>
<P>
Helping the children: In forming stepfamilies, "children often have a great 
number of losses parents don't consider, such as a house, school, friends and 
familiarity," Papernow says. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine the feelings of Bridget McMahon of Anaheim, who for three years enjoyed 
a close relationship with her single father and functioned as "the lady of the 
house." When her father remarried two years ago, Dad's three-bedroom home had 
to accommodate a boy. 
</P>
<P>
Bridget, then 8, gave up her room to share the largest bedroom with sister 
Brianne, 5, and stepsister Melanie, 12. 
</P>
<P>
"From Bridget's perspective, not only did everything change, but she and I were 
supposed to kiss each other goodnight every night," says stepmother Judy 
McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
Children in stepfamilies also face loyalty binds, feeling "if I care about my 
stepmom, I am betraying my mother," Papernow says, noting that children need 
help with this conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"While it is fair to ask a child to be civil to stepparents, it is not fair to 
expect children to love them," Papernow adds. 
</P>
<P>
Upon becoming a stepmother three years ago, Ceci Van Zitter took Brandy and 
Kelly aside and explained, "I know your love for your mom is very, very special 
and it should be, and I don't want to take away any of your love for her." 
</P>
<P>
"I understood," Van Zitter said, "because my own father remarried, and no 
matter how good my stepmother was to me, I could never feel the same way I felt 
for my mom." 
</P>
<P>
Papernow, whose former husband is dating, tells her 6-year-old daughter: "I 
know Daddy has a new girlfriend. I hope you will get to know her and perhaps 
you will develop a separate relationship. But you don't have to worry, I will 
always be your mommy." 
</P>
<P>
Children's feelings of divided loyalty also can be eased by Papernow's edict: 
"You may not bad-mouth your ex-spouse to your child, ever." 
</P>
<P>
The latter is more easily said than done, since divorced couples commonly 
harbor feelings of anger and jealousy and find it wrenching to share children. 
For help, Brandy and Kelly's father and stepmother turned to a support group 
offered through the Stepfamily Assn. of America. Their mother and stepfather 
attended meetings for remarried families organized through their church. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways the two households are dissimilar. At Mom's, where financial 
resources are more limited, the girls spend a great deal of time at home with 
parents and are expected to attend church every week. Life at Dad's includes 
movies, horseback riding and vacations, with a more relaxed attitude about 
worship. 
</P>
<P>
In both households, the family configurations change. Their stepfather's 
children live out of state. Roy Van Broekhuizen's daughter, Angela, 7, visits 
regularly, and son, David, 18, will join the Corona household for the summer. 
When stepmother Ceci Van Zitter gives birth in February, Brandy and Kelly will 
have a new sibling, another family adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, things are going quite well between the two families. 
</P>
<P>
"It still isn't easy," said the girls' mother, Louise Van Broekhuizen. 
"However, we came to the point where we realized we all love our kids and we 
all want to see them loved and well adjusted. We just can't be fighting out our 
differences." 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the stepfamily, Papernow believes it takes four to seven years to 
solidify relationships and for both families to be able to "do business 
together." 
</P>
<P>
But eventually many families do enjoy success and enduring relationships. The 
Vishers report joyous reunions with eight children and 10 grandchildren. Upon 
the birth of a baby recently, one of the Visher's children called a 
stepsibling, seeking advice on how to care for the infant. 
</P>
<P>
The highs and lows of stepparenting are reflected by Ginger Davis, who, upon 
remarriage, combined her two children with her husband's three, with ages 
ranging from 2 to 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked hard at this and it has been very rewarding. However, if -- heaven 
forbid -- my husband dropped dead tomorrow, I wouldn't so much as have a cup of 
coffee with a man unless I knew his children were grown."

SHE DRESSES CHILDREN TO MOVE IN STYLE, COMFORT AND SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
How do you get a screaming baby to calm down and maybe even smile? Try removing 
his clothing, because it just might be making him miserable, suggests Shelley 
Armstrong, who recently opened Cotton Kangaroo, a children's store in Pasadena 
for infants to children Size 7. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong opened the store because she had difficulty finding the kind of 
clothes that made her children happy. Now she is running a one-woman campaign 
to teach parents how to dress their children for maximum comfort. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a science to this. The wrong clothes may even interfere with a baby's 
development," warns Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
For example, when your baby is around 4 months old and begins to roll, 
protruding buttons or decorations will hurt and encumber him. Some babies will 
even give up trying to roll if the clothes are binding, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong believes children of all ages need clothing that allows complete 
freedom of movement. But as small children's motor skills develop, their 
clothing needs change. To help parents choose the appropriate items, she offers 
the following tips in her informal classes held twice a month and free of 
charge at the store: 
</P>
<P>
INFANTS: Babies need to be able to explore with their hands, so avoid outfits 
with attached mittens. If you are using mittens to prevent the baby from 
scratching himself, try a simple manicure instead. Overuse of mittens inhibits 
children learning how to use their hands, Armstrong says. 
</P>
<P>
Dress your baby in the same number of layers of clothes that you are wearing; 
it is a great misconception that babies get cold more easily than adults. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure that buttons are sewn on securely, so that your child cannot pull 
them off and pop them in his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
CRAWLERS: This is the time when children can become the most encumbered by 
their clothing. They get tangled in skirts, dresses and loose-fitting pants. 
Armstrong recommends pants with elastic around the bottom of the legs to ensure 
the knees have some padding and to prevent the child from crawling out of the 
clothes. The knees take a lot of abuse at this stage of development so it is 
wise to keep them covered to prevent chapping. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure neck and arm openings are large enough for comfort. Some young 
children wonder if they are going to get stuck in turtlenecks while putting 
them on. If possible, children should try them on in the store to ensure proper 
fit. 
</P>
<P>
TODDLERS: Children need and like to learn how to dress themselves, so buy 
clothes that ease the process. Elasticized pants and uncomplicated pullovers 
without buttons and zippers are best. Mark the sides of your child's shoes so 
that he can distinguish left from right. 
</P>

EX-HERALD STAFFERS FIND JOBS IN TELEVISION; 
</P>
<P>
EMPLOYMENT: JOURNALISTS COPE WITH CHANGES. THEY PROMISE A HARDER NEWS FOCUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN HERBERT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
KTTV Channel 11 and KABC-TV Channel 7 have turned to veterans of the defunct 
Los Angeles Herald Examiner to fill key positions in their news departments. 
</P>
<P>
In the two months since the newspaper folded, KTTV has hired Rick Arthur, who 
spent the past 4 1/2 years as the paper's sports editor, as managing editor; 
assistant city editor Betsy Bates as planning director, and sports writer Bob 
Keisser as sports editor. The trio were recommended by Mitchell Fink, the 
Herald Examiner's "Page 2" columnist, who had also been delivering a video 
version of his column on Channel 11's newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
KABC-TV, meanwhile, brought aboard Linda Breakstone, the Herald Examiner's 
chief political writer and columnist, as a "reporting producer" on political 
and investigative stories, a position that will lead to on-air reporting. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 11 news director Joe Barnes said that he has turned to print reporters 
and editors out of a desire to "see more journalism in television news." 
</P>
<P>
"There are good television news people, but I think good, experienced newspaper 
people have a wealth of experience and judgement they can bring into a 
television newsroom," Barnes said in an interview. "The people we've hired 
bring a good history and knowledge of stories and contacts from this area and 
that's real important to us. They also bring more and fresher ideas to 
editorial meetings, and the more good ideas we have, the better our coverage 
will be." 
</P>
<P>
Arthur has been placed in charge of the station's reporters and of overseeing 
the selection and placement of stories. He said he has also been promised a 
role in proposed newscasts that Fox would deliver to the seven stations it 
owns. 
</P>
<P>
"The differences aren't as big as I had anticipated," Arthur said. "News is 
news. The transition is easier for me than it might be for others because of 
the uniqueness of the Herald Examiner. We were the closest thing to television 
in print. We were big, bold, visual, dramatic and exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Breakstone believes that working in television will be much different than 
newspapers, with each medium having its advantages and disadvantages. 
</P>
<P>
"In television, you can do a story better than in print because you are able to 
show scenes, pictures and facial reactions. You can capture the story simply by 
people's mannerisms," said Breakstone, who had been with the Herald Examiner 
since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"On a newspaper you have more of a chance to investigate a story. Some stories 
are really paper trails and take a long time to do. You can check a lot of 
things out from sources and on television it's better to have those people on 
camera. 
</P>
<P>
"If you break a story on a newspaper, it is on a piece of paper, and you can go 
back and look at it. On television, it evaporates into thin air." 
</P>
<P>
At the Herald Examiner, Breakstone broke stories on then-Lt. Gov. Mike Curb 
claiming political endorsements he didn't have, Mayor Tom Bradley's finances 
and the revelation that Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) was dyeing his remaining 
few strands of hair during his unsuccessful bid for the 1984 Democratic 
Presidential nomination. Her only television experience before joining Channel 
7 had come as a panelist on several public affairs and interview shows. 
</P>
<P>
Keisser, who had been the Herald Examiner's sports television columnist, 
admitted that he was "suspicious" of sports reporting on television. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was just about showing highlights and doing soft, fluffy 
coverage," he said. "Everybody is looking for something that works, and when 
they find it, they stick with it. Joe (Barnes) convinced me that he really 
wants to do news here, and that's important for me to be here." 
</P>
<P>
Channel 11's hourlong 10 p.m. weeknight newscast has undergone many editorial 
and anchor changes over the past two years in a consistently futile effort to 
challenge KTLA Channel 5's longtime ratings dominance among the market's four 
VHF independent stations. In last November's ratings "sweeps," KTTV's newscast 
received a 2.5 Nielsen rating, compared to KTLA's 5.1. (Each rating point 
represents 49,315 households.) 
</P>
<P>
More "subtle" alterations are in store, Arthur said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to speak to the individual Angeleno who's watching us and cover what's 
important in his or her city: Who owns L.A. and who runs L.A.," Arthur said. 
"We want to speak conversationally, captivatingly and casually to our audience. 
We want to give them the news they need to know and also give them 
entertainment at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Keisser, who gave up a job with The National, an all-sports newspaper set to 
debut this year, has some ambitious plans for Channel 11's sportscasts. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to do some enterprise reporting, find issues and investigate them," 
Keisser said. "I want to accent news as opposed to just features. I want those 
features to be news oriented, visually appealing and interesting to people 
outside of sports fans."

NBC CHANGES 'DRUG WARS' PROMOS AFTER NORIEGA ARREST

Following the surrender of former Panama strongman Manuel Noriega Wednesday 
night, NBC said Thursday it was changing its promos of "Drug Wars: The Camarena 
Story" to include mention of Noriega's alleged ties to drug traffickers such as 
those depicted in the miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
The six-hour drama, which airs Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, tells the story of 
Enrique (Kiki) Camarena, a United States Drug Enforcement Administration agent 
whose abduction and murder in 1985 has been tied to drug lords in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"Noriega was the funnel for drug lords in Mexico, and Kiki Camarena went up 
against a major drug lord there," John Miller, the NBC vice president in charge 
of promotion, said in an interview Thursday. "We began to mention Noriega in 
headlines in our promos several days ago. But last night, as we were watching 
news stories about Noriega's surrender and his ties to the drug trade, we 
decided, 'This is a real connection to a major news event -- let's take 
advantage of it."' 
</P>
<P>
Exact wording of the new spots was still being worked out.

BIGGEST SEASON EVER HAS ITS DOWN SIDE TOO; 
</P>
<P>
SALES: RETAILERS ENJOY 24% INCREASE OVER LAST YEAR, BUT A GLUT OF MAJOR TITLES 
IS A ROCK IN SOME COMPANY STOCKINGS. 
</P>

<P>
For home-video fans, last month was the merriest December ever. For video 
retailers, it was fairly glorious too. And most video companies were happy 
because sales boomed during the holiday season. But for some video companies, 
because of a rental-market glut, it was a disappointing month. 
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest holiday sales season ever for home video. According to a 
study by the New York research firm Alexander &amp; Associates, sales were up 
24% in the September to mid-December period to $620 million, compared to $470 
million in a comparable time period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, because of the unusual glut of major new rental titles last month -- 
including "When Harry Met Sally," "Star Trek V," "Great Balls of Fire," 
"Nightmare on Elm Street V," "Lock Up" and "Weekend at Bernie's" -- video 
companies sold fewer copies of these major titles than expected to retailers 
and distributors. So some manufacturers such as Paramount, which released "Star 
Trek V," didn't make as much money as predicted on these big movies. 
</P>
<P>
December used to be a relatively dead month for new rentals. Video companies 
rarely shipped major titles in that month, figuring retailers had exhausted 
their budgets in October and November stocking up to meet the demands of the 
Christmas sales market. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining the sudden change of strategy last month, Alan Perper, vice 
president of marketing for Paramount, said, "Many companies had the same idea 
at the same time: to put out a big rental title in December, which had 
traditionally been such a quiet rental month. This year there were eight to 10 
major rental titles as opposed to one or two last year. We all figured that 
some of the big holiday titles like 'Batman' and 'Bambi' would increase traffic 
in the stores, which would increase rentals." 
</P>
<P>
Normally, he said, some companies might have waited until mid-winter to put out 
these rental titles. But they wanted to avoid the heavy competition from 
low-priced releases in February -- "Lethal Weapon 2" and "Indiana Jones and the 
Last Crusade" -- and March, when "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" is due. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to "Star Trek V," Perper said: "We sold about 10% less (to retailers 
and distributors) than we had hoped to sell. Everybody did less on their big 
titles." 
</P>
<P>
But Nelson Entertainment, which released "When Harry Met Sally," didn't suffer, 
according to company president Reg Childs. Industry sources claim that the 
company expected to ship 400,000 copies but wound up putting only 300,000 in 
the marketplace. Childs insisted that the company shipped 363,000, which, he 
added, just about matched their expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Though the rental-title glut hit some manufacturers right in the wallet, the 
flood of new movies in December was an added Christmas present for renters. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Caplan, of the Midwest's Applause Video chain, reported bang-up business 
for the week after Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great week for rentals," he said. "Schools and colleges are closed. 
Kids, teen-agers and college students are home looking for something to do. 
Christmas shopping is over so people can relax. They want to rent movies. That 
week they'll rent anything. The week before Christmas isn't so great because 
people are still busy getting ready for Christmas. But the week after, we did 
three times the business we did in the week before." 
</P>
<P>
The latest report on "Batman" -- out in mid-November at $24.98 -- is that sales 
have slowed down but rentals are still thriving. It's been No. 1 on the 
Billboard magazine rental chart since early December. 
</P>
<P>
"Batman" sales have been strong too, but some retailers indicate that they are 
not as strong as expected. Apparently there's no shortage of copies for sale. 
According to estimates, Warner Video shipped between 11 million and 12 million 
cassettes to retailers and distributors. 
</P>
<P>
Tower Video executive John Thrasher said that his company's stores have sold 
40,000 copies of "Batman" but still have thousands of copies in stock.

But this is video retailers talking. Just because "Batman" is not sold out in 
video stores -- which usually offer only small discounts -- that doesn't mean 
its sales are slumping. "Batman" is sold, often at huge discounts, in many 
other outlets. 
</P>
<P>
The study by Alexander &amp; Associates confirms that outlets other than video 
stores have been successfully selling titles like "Batman," "Bambi" and "Who 
Framed Roger Rabbit" -- which were the most popular movies in the home-video 
sales market this last holiday season. Video stores, the study reported, 
accounted for only 16% of holiday sales. Mass merchants -- discount chains like 
Target -- did 37% of the sales business.

NORIEGA STORY FAILS TO HALT KNX'S COVERAGE OF BRUIN-TROJAN GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

KFWB-AM(980), which has offered a radio headline service for 20 years, may not 
always deliver depth, but did live up to its format proclamation of "All News 
All the Time" during the Manuel Noriega surrender Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, crosstown rival KNX-AM (1070) which has a reputation for 
providing more meat in its news coverage and has a hall full of journalism 
awards to prove it, delivered something else. 
</P>
<P>
Though initial reports of the Panamanian strongman's capture were carried by 
the CBS owned-and-operated station Wednesday evening, KNX News Director Bob 
Sims decided about an hour into the story to return to regular programming. 
That meant USC and UCLA for two hours of basketball with time out for news 
headlines at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't much news after 6:45 or 7 p.m.," Sims said Thursday. "I was 
trying to think of what we could do from a news point of view that would 
justify blowing out a scheduled piece of programming and I couldn't think of 
what it would be. You can certainly recapitulate or write the same news in a 
different way and tell the same story over and over. But it's not new 
developments. It's just what we've already told you. Tell you again and again 
and again." 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to broaden KNX's audience and boost its ratings, the station 
carries some non-news features, such as an hour of "food news" each morning and 
an hour of old-time radio drama each night, in addition to its seasonal 
football, baseball and basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
Far from criticizing Sims, his counterpart at KFWB has nothing but praise for 
the KNX operation which, by its very nature, he calls "newsradio" as opposed to 
KFWB's bona fide "all-news" format. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are very tough competition but they have chosen play-by-play sports 
as part of their programming thrust," said KFWB News Director Ken Beck. "We 
stick with a news format come hell or high water." 
</P>
<P>
Both stations carried President Bush's news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me assure you if the President had decided to speak at 7:30, we would have 
put him on instead of the game," said Sims. "If the news of Noriega had been 2 
or 3 hours later instead of earlier in the evening, the game would have been 
the casualty. But the story was done, you know. Just wasn't much left to talk 
about."

VIETNAM VETERAN KOVIC MAY RUN AGAINST DORNAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vietnam veteran and anti-war activist Ron Kovic, whose life is chronicled in 
the film "Born on the Fourth of July," is considering a race this year for the 
House seat held by archconservative Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), 
according to Kovic associates and Democratic Party officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We met with Mr. Kovic. We encouraged him to run," said Howard M. Schloss, a 
spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which recruits 
and backs Democratic candidates in key congressional races. 
</P>
<P>
The DCCC's chief recruiter, Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.), traveled to Southern 
California last fall to talk over a Dornan challenge with Kovic, 43, who is 
paralyzed from the chest down as the result of a Vietnam combat wound. The 
meeting with Synar was held because of "mutual" interest in a Kovic candidacy, 
Schloss said. 
</P>
<P>
Kovic, who lives in Redondo Beach outside of Dornan's Orange County 
congressional district, said through a spokesman that he would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan, 56, said he would welcome the fight, should Kovic choose to run. 
</P>
<P>
"Kovic is going to have to defend the Hollywood far left," Dornan said 
Thursday. "If he thinks he's going to recruit Oliver Stone (who directed 
Kovic's film biography) and Top-Gun-turned-top-malcontent Tom Cruise (who plays 
Kovic in the film), and bring the whole Jane Fonda team down here to Orange 
County, I welcome it. Let's go." 
</P>
<P>
Sid Galanty, a longtime friend of Kovic and a Los Angeles political consultant, 
said that Kovic was intrigued by the DCCC's interest and that he is considering 
a race against Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
After Synar's visit, Galanty said, Kovic also was wooed by several House 
Democratic leaders in another Los Angeles meeting. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt 
(D-Mo.) and Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown met with Kovic while they 
were in Los Angeles for a DCCC fund-raiser in November, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
Foley's and Gephardt's staff had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was very taken by the fact that some of the most powerful men in 
the Democratic leadership in the country would want to meet him and convince 
him to run for office," Galanty said. 
</P>
<P>
"From that point on, he expressed the fact that he would love to serve his 
country again," he said. "Having served as a Marine and winning a Medal of 
Honor, he felt . . . that might be an opportunity he would consider." 
</P>
<P>
Galanty said he suggested Kovic's name to DCCC officials when they called him 
last fall during a national search for potential candidates. He said Kovic had 
not considered a campaign bid before he was approached and that he was 
sensitive about being perceived as an opportunist capitalizing on the celebrity 
status created by release of the movie. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Dornan said he had played a key role in one of the pivotal events 
in Kovic's life. During the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami, Kovic 
and another disabled Vietnam veteran gained access to the convention floor and 
briefly disrupted the proceedings. Dornan, then a television producer, said he 
was the man who let Kovic in. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally wheeled him in," Dornan said. "Against my better judgment, but he 
promised he'd be polite. He broke his word within the hour." 
</P>
<P>
Dornan also said that Kovic appeared three times on "The Robert K. Dornan 
Show," a KTLA television program that Dornan hosted from 1970 to 1973. 
</P>
<P>
"We kind of get along," Dornan said, "because he knew I respected him for not 
dodging the draft and for serving. . . . Ron is a fighter, he's a Marine. He 
wouldn't want me to baby him. He'd want a two-fisted race." 
</P>
<P>
Dornan's 38th Congressional District, which includes Santa Ana, Garden Grove, 
Buena Park and sections of Anaheim, is the only House seat in Orange County 
with a Democratic edge in registration. Democrats lead Republicans in the 
district by about 50% to 41%. 
</P>
<P>
The district also includes the largest concentration of Vietnamese in the 
United States, according to the National Journal's 1990 political almanac. The 
almanac said that the Vietnamese community has supported Dornan's hawkish 
politics and contributed to a 69% turnout in the district for Ronald Reagan in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
If Kovic chooses to enter the race, one of his more formidable tasks will be 
raising money. Dornan's 1980 congressional campaign was the most expensive in 
the country. In 1988, he spent $1.75 million when he won reelection over 
Democratic political novice Jerry Yudelson by a margin of 60% to 36%. Yudelson 
managed to raise only $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it," said Schloss of the DCCC. "Running against an incumbent, 
especially one who has been there for a while, it's not only very expensive, 
but the odds are certainly against winning. Not that it can't be done. But it's 
a rough road." 
</P>
<P>
The political dynamics of a Kovic-Dornan race would be unusual. 
</P>
<P>
Schloss said the DCCC promised to help finance a Kovic candidacy. And Kovic 
would be expected to tap the significant pool of Democratic money in Hollywood, 
which is experiencing a new activism by celebrities in liberal causes and 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Dornan played a major role in President Bush's 1988 campaign 
and was rumored to have been considered for a high-level presidential 
appointment. If Dornan's seat is threatened, political experts said, they 
expect Bush to campaign on Dornan's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have the biggest star of Hollywood of all time in politics -- Ronald 
Reagan," Dornan said. "So, what I say to the Hollywood left is: 'Try again. 
Come and get me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Townsend, an officer in the Orange County Democratic Party, said a 
Kovic-Dornan race would pit a candidate "who has actually fought for the flag 
against one who just wrapped himself in it." 
</P>
<P>
Townsend, a vice president in the Orange County development company of 
Democratic activist David Stein, said he was aware that Kovic was being 
encouraged to run for the seat. He added that Kovic "will have tremendous 
fund-raising potential from a national base." 
</P>
<P>
"Born on the Fourth of July" was released just before Christmas and has been 
nominated for several Golden Globe awards, including best picture, best actor 
for Cruise, and best director for Stone, whose earlier Vietnam-era movie, 
"Platoon," won four Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
As depicted in the movie, Kovic was raised in a strict Catholic family on Long 
Island and grew up to be a gung-ho Marine who volunteered to serve in the 
Vietnam War and was paralyzed during a 1968 combat mission. 
</P>
<P>
The movie follows Kovic's personal struggle when he returned from the war as a 
decorated and disabled veteran who received cruel treatment in a government 
hospital and was alienated from his former friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
Kovic eventually became active in the anti-war movement. The closing scenes of 
the movie depict Kovic and Bob Muller, founder of Vietnam Veterans of America, 
being ejected from the GOP convention after shouting anti-war slogans during 
President Nixon's acceptance speech. 
</P>
<P>
In the dramatic scene, Cruise is beaten and bloodied by police outside the 
convention before he is rescued by fellow protesters. In the final scene of the 
movie, Cruise is wheeled onto the podium of the 1976 Democratic National 
Convention in a re-creation of Kovic's speech, which was enthusiastically 
received. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan, who has been in the House for 11 years, is a former Air Force fighter 
pilot as well as television talk show host. He has acquired a reputation as a 
flamboyant, theatrical advocate of a strong national defense and a staunch foe 
of abortion and homosexual rights. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Dornan has been known to forge unusual coalitions around key issues. 
For example, last summer, Dornan joined liberal Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), an 
avowed homosexual, in sponsoring legislation to create a national police corps. 
The program would attempt to recruit new police officers for the nation's 
cities by offering to reimburse them for college tuition. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan was first elected in the district in 1984 when he defeated incumbent 
Democrat Jerry Patterson by a margin of 53% to 45%. 
</P>
<P>
Before that election, Dornan had already served three terms in Congress 
representing the old 27th Congressional District, centered around Santa Monica 
in Los Angeles County. When the district was redrawn by Democrats during the 
1981 reapportionment, Dornan lost many of his Republican constituents and 
decided to run instead for the U.S. Senate in 1982. He came in fourth in the 
Republican primary.

<P>
The chairwoman of the California State University trustees, who has claimed a 
community college degree she did not earn, could be removed from her post under 
legislation introduced Thursday aimed at assuring that governmental appointees 
tell the truth about their credentials. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara), chairman of the Senate Education Committee, 
said he wrote the legislation in response to revelations in December that CSU 
Chairwoman Marianthi K. Lansdale incorrectly claimed a 1959 associate of arts 
degree from Long Beach City College when selected by Gov. George Deukmejian and 
confirmed by the Senate for a spot on the powerful board. 
</P>
<P>
Lansdale publicly apologized for the claim after she acknowledged in a Times 
article that she never received a degree from the community college, where 
records show she attended for 13 semesters from 1957 to 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Under Hart's bill -- intended to apply retroactively to Lansdale and other 
gubernatorial appointees -- anyone chosen for a job that requires Senate 
confirmation could be removed if the appointee were found to have knowingly 
given false information during a confirmation hearing, usually low-key meetings 
that rubber-stamp the governor's selection. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also includes a provision that would require gubernatorial appointees 
to submit to the Senate an accurate record of their educational background -- 
in writing and under penalty of perjury, a criminal misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to send a clear message to people who are appointees of the governor, 
and subject to confirmation of the Senate, that we take this information with a 
great deal of seriousness," said Hart. "If they are not comprehensive (in their 
background) there is going to be a price to be paid." 
</P>
<P>
Hart said he drafted the proposed law when he learned that the Senate has no 
authority to remove gubernatorial appointees once they are confirmed. 
Appointees under fire must resign voluntarily for a new vacancy to be created, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hart also said Thursday that he believes Lansdale should resign if she can't 
come up with a "compelling case" as to why she falsely claimed the 1959 degree. 
"I think she should step down or else it sends the wrong message to the 
students," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Barbara Democrat joins Senate President Pro Tempore David A. Roberti 
(D-Los Angeles) in calling for Lansdale's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was Hart's name, as chairman of the Senate Education Committee, 
that was invoked on Lansdale's behalf when she appeared before the Senate Rules 
Committee for questioning in March, 1985, following her appointment by 
Deukmejian the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of Sen. Gary Hart, he informed me that if we didn't confirm your 
appointment, that we'd all be in deep trouble," Sen. Henry Mello 
(D-Watsonville) said during the brief confirmation hearing. "And looking at 
your qualifications, I agree with him." 
</P>
<P>
An information sheet supplied to the senators from Deukmejian's office showed 
Lansdale's educational credentials as "1959: A.A. Degree, Literature, Long 
Beach City College," legislative files show. 
</P>
<P>
Lansdale supplied the information to Deukmejian's office by filling out a 
standard appointment application form, a spokesman for the governor has said. 
</P>
<P>
Lansdale and her husband, Long Beach developer William (Bit) Lansdale, are 
longtime supporters of Deukmejian and gave the governor more than $100,000 in 
donations and the use of a corporate airplane during his 1982 campaign, public 
records show. Both received prominent administration appointments after 
Deukmejian's 1982 election. 
</P>
<P>
As chairwoman, Lansdale heads a 24-member board responsible for making policy 
decisions for one of the world's largest public four-year university systems. 
She selects colleagues to serve on special committees, presides over its six 
annual board meetings and helps set the tone in salary negotiations with the 
system's 19,200 faculty members. The chairmanship is rotated among members, who 
are paid $100 a day plus expenses for meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Lansdale could not be reached for comment Thursday on the proposed legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gore, Deukmejian's press secretary, said the governor has not talked to 
Lansdale since her public admission last month. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, he's concerned about Mrs. Lansdale but there's the State of the 
State (Address) to do and a number of pressing issues," said Gore. "I believe 
Mrs. Lansdale's last comment was that she apologized and she would meet with 
Sen. Roberti. We would like to see the outcome of that meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie L. Brown (D-San Francisco) -- an ex officio member of 
the CSU board -- declined to say earlier this week whether he thinks Lansdale 
should resign. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown said misstatements of credentials are a violation of public trust, 
and he made it clear that he expects any of his appointees to government boards 
and commissions to resign if caught falsifying their backgrounds or engaging in 
other questionable conduct. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any person I appointed who misrepresented themselves, I would 
even have to have that discussion with," Brown said. "I'm sure they would pick 
up the telephone and offer to quit. Whether or not I'd accept their offer 
depends on the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Lansdale's admission has brought a strong reaction from university professors, 
and the Academic Senate may discuss the issue during meetings today, said Pat 
Nichelson, president of the California Faculty Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Nichelson said the CFA, the union that represents the professors and other 
state university employees, may take an official stand on Lansdale's 
falsification in a few days. Two CFA officials were in Sacramento to gauge 
legislative reaction to the Lansdale controversy, he added. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, CSU-Stanislaus economics professor Bill Crist, said legislators 
were "very upset" over Lansdale's admission but generally didn't feel she had 
to resign. 
</P>
<P>
"If Trustee Lansdale had the reputation of being a real bad trustee or not a 
good leader, that would be the case," said Crist, director of the CFA's 
political action committee. "But that's not the general sense. She's done a 
credible job on the board and that's going to temper people's thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Crist also said that CSU Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds was in Sacramento on 
Thursday to meet with legislators, presumably to soothe concerns about Lansdale 
and rally support for the trustee. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds has voiced strong support for the Deukmejian appointee, whom she says 
is conscientious and enthusiastic.

DIANNE KLEIN: YOU CAN STICK IT TO THEM IN STYLE WITH 'NUN-CHUCKS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By Dianne Klein

<TEXT>
<P>
I saw the movie "Colors," so I know that cops are pretty macho guys. 
</P>
<P>
When Robert Duvall was showing the gang punks that he was just as macho as they 
were, he would whip out his side-handle baton, otherwise known as a billy club, 
and start rapping it, slowly, in the palm of his hand. 
</P>
<P>
David Dye, a senior police officer in Costa Mesa, tells me that Duvall had it 
right. When Dye tells me about the macho cops he knows, he makes a fist and 
slugs it into the palm of his other hand. 
</P>
<P>
This apparently is a variation on the Duvall-executed macho sign, but it is one 
I understand equally as well. Macho types, even if they are women, feel 
especially macho when they are brandishing something with the potential to 
inflict pain. 
</P>
<P>
But Dye says that the baton has its drawbacks. It's bulky, heavy and not all 
that versatile. Plus even civilian machos can pick it up and hit someone. Maybe 
even the arresting officer. 
</P>
<P>
So Dye is spreading the word about nunchakus, which you may remember from the 
macho cult films of martial-arts master Bruce Lee. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa Police Department has been using them for more than two years 
now. Laguna Beach and Seal Beach have them and so do those lone rangers of the 
Orange County Transit District police in the event that a disgruntled bus 
passenger gets especially unruly. 
</P>
<P>
Nunchakus, in fact, seem to be catching on like wildfire. San Diego just made 
them standard issue and Dye, a freckle-face redhead who looks about as much 
like Bruce Lee as I do, is in demand these days as a media spokesman and expert 
on the things. 
</P>
<P>
Affectionately dubbed "nun-chucks" by the guys who tote them, the nunchakus are 
two 12-inch, polycarbon plastic sticks connected by a double nylon cord. The 
whole thing weighs 12 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
A plainclothes detective can carry it inside a suit jacket just as easily as an 
aerospace engineer might stash a slide rule or a six-pack of pocket pens. 
</P>
<P>
True, these nun-chucks don't look like much, but when you stare at them for a 
while, your mind tends to conjure up all sorts of potentially painful uses. 
</P>
<P>
And if it's macho you're talking, mirror, mirror on the wall, the nunchakus are 
the most macho of them all. 
</P>
<P>
Just take in some Bruce Lee films -- "Enter the Dragon" is a good place to 
start -- and you can see their potential for sweatless destruction. When the 
master swings his nunchakus at his foes, his arms take on the lethal force of a 
chain saw. 
</P>
<P>
And to hear Dye tell it, these two sticks have psychic powers as well, having 
given the cops of Costa Mesa the inner peace of Zen masters. 
</P>
<P>
"The officers feel confident," Dye says. "When people see the nunchakus, they 
have a respect for them. Bruce Lee is the first thing they think of." 
</P>
<P>
Dye, who incidentally, is a black belt of varying degrees in aikido, 
aikijujutsu, judo and karate, does a few demonstrations for me. 
</P>
<P>
He twists my wrist, vise-like, between the sticks and calls it the chopstick 
maneuver. He poses, Bruce Lee style, with his nun-chucks in the defensive 
postion. Then he whips them around in something like a high-speed 
loop-the-loop. 
</P>
<P>
I am impressed. I want some. I am imagining all sorts of practical household 
uses. 
</P>
<P>
When my daughter refuses to relinquish the tube of toothpaste that she is 
smearing all over the rug, I can whip out the nunchakus and quickly dislodge 
her hand from around the offending tube. 
</P>
<P>
Like the officers in more than 30 police departments in seven states, thanks to 
the nunchakus, I will have accomplished my mission quickly without resulting 
harm to the suspect or to myself. 
</P>
<P>
When my husband is standing there with his arms crossed in front of his chest 
telling me, "No, I don't want to go to the mall with you. The Hawks are playing 
the Celtics," I can wedge the nunchakus between his arms and twist it behind 
his back. I think about making him say "uncle," but maybe I'll make him say 
something like, "whatever you want." 
</P>
<P>
But Dye quickly squashes my fantasy. He says that unless I am a police officer 
or am enrolled in some martial-arts class, it would be a felony for me to be 
caught with the nunchakus. 
</P>
<P>
I can buy them, he says, at a martial-arts supply store. I just can't possess 
them. 
</P>
<P>
I should have figured as much. Possess the nunchakus and one possesses the 
epitome of macho. 
</P>
<P>
How's that for Zen? 
</P>

AID PROVIDERS SEE BIG GAP WHEN SOS STOPS SERVING NEEDY

The demise of the Share Our Selves charity will place a tremendous burden on 
other welfare groups that already are faced with a growing clientele and too 
few resources to serve them, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It looms like a horrible headache and dark cloud," said Debby O'Connor, 
executive director of FISH Inc., a volunteer group which provides food, shelter 
and other assistance for needy and elderly people. 
</P>
<P>
"We are completely overburdened. We don't have the manpower, space or money to 
fill the gap left by SOS (Share Our Selves). I know the need is there, but I 
don't know what is going to happen to these people. They will have to do 
without." 
</P>
<P>
Warren Johnson, business manager for the Orange County chapter of the Salvation 
Army, also said his group is already feeding and sheltering as many clients as 
it can handle. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we can shoulder any more," Johnson said, adding that the 
organization gives shelter to about 300 people a night and serves meals daily. 
"We are greatly disappointed that this has come about. (SOS) has been a 
mainstay in the delivery of services to a variety of people in need." 
</P>
<P>
Share Our Selves, a 20-year-old, all-volunteer agency that provides food, 
shelter, clothing and financial assistance to the needy, is being evicted from 
its home at the city-managed Rea Community Center on Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa City Council on Wednesday voted 4 to 1 not to spend city money 
to help SOS relocate and denied a request to extend the agency's stay at the 
community center. 
</P>
<P>
Medical and dental programs operated by SOS will remain at the community center 
until 1991 and are not affected. 
</P>
<P>
The charity and its founder, Jean Forbath, have become almost an institution in 
Costa Mesa and Orange County, serving more than 60,000 families a year. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, its death may have been hastened by its success as a private, 
nonprofit alternative for the needy -- many of whom are too poor to afford the 
county's high cost of living but make too much money to qualify for government 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the residential area where the charity is located had complained 
about alleged disruptions caused by SOS clients. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a disproportionate share of social welfare organizations on the West 
Side . . . that attract an element that a prudent person would describe as 
undesirable," resident Pat Dolan told the council Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, social welfare officials said getting rid of SOS will not make the 
homeless go away. 
</P>
<P>
"The sad thing is we want the private sector to do these things because they do 
a better job; they do it more efficiently. The government cannot provide the 
kinds of services that SOS can because of the nature of those services," said 
Councilwoman Mary Hornbuckle, the only member who favored supporting SOS. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect it will mean more and more people out on the streets," said Sam 
Boyce, co-director of Newport Beach-based SPIN or Street People in Need. 
</P>
<P>
SOS and SPIN provide money for emergency shelter, such as motels, for homeless 
families. 
</P>
<P>
"People who previously used SOS will be hitting harder on organizations like us 
for those services," Boyce said. "But we have limited resources. There will be 
more children and families on the streets at night who might otherwise have 
been put up in a motel." 
</P>
<P>
Donald Swanson, 45, said he has sought assistance at SOS every day since he 
arrived in Orange County from Las Vegas two months ago. Swanson, who grew up in 
Laguna Beach, said he has been sleeping on the streets in a sleeping bag since 
he returned here and relies on SOS for all of his meals. He also uses the 
center's address, 661 Hamilton Ave., to receive his mail. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see some of their points, but why punish everybody?" he said, referring 
to the community's attitude toward SOS. "I don't ask anybody for nothing, I 
don't panhandle. The only time I talk to someone I don't know on the street I 
just say 'good morning' or something. It (the shutdown) is going to hurt." 
</P>
<P>
SOS officials said Thursday that they will hold a rally on Jan. 13 -- two days 
before they are to vacate the community center -- and will invite homeless 
people from around the county to show their support.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;

<P>
MAYS SAYS CITY'S PAST HOLDS KEY TO FUTURE

<P>
Mayor Thomas F. Mays envisions this beach community going back in time in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Our redeveloped downtown will be made into a village, just as the town started 
out many years ago," Mays said. "The downtown will have a traditional Main 
Street with a village atmosphere. You can walk there and take care of all your 
basic needs, such as going to the dry cleaners, the dentist, the real estate 
office. We're making it into a traditional downtown." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach's new "downtown village" will be the result of a $500-million 
redevelopment effort. Mays said the first new buildings downtown will open in 
1990. "The Waterfront Hilton Hotel will open in July or August, and we expect 
another hotel to be under way by then," he said. "The Pierside Pavilion -- the 
new building on Main Street at Pacific Coast Highway -- also will open in 1990. 
It'll have movie theaters, restaurants, a new Golden Bear night club, business 
offices and retail shops." 
</P>
<P>
On the Main Street block next to Pierside Pavilion, work will start in 1990 on 
parking structures and retail shops, the mayor added. 
</P>
<P>
Mays said that in 1990 the city also expects work to start on a new pier to 
replace the landmark structure that has been closed because of its unsafe 
condition since the summer of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be going to Washington and Sacramento to try to get more funds for the 
pier," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the northwest corner of the city, the county is expected to dedicate the 
start of a new regional park that will connect the city's existing Central Park 
with bluffs overlooking the Bolsa Chica ecological preserve. The park is 
envisioned as having 113 acres, but Mays said he will be working to get the 
acreage increased. 
</P>
<P>
The Bolsa Chica preserve itself will be greatly enhanced in the 1990s, Mays 
said. "Bolsa Chica will go from about 300 acres of wetlands to 1,150 acres of 
restored wetlands," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council early in 1990 is expected to act on a proposed plan for a 
massive new residential area in the city. Called the Holly-Seacliff 
Development, the project would convert 768 acres of land used chiefly for oil 
wells into homes and parks. About four new parks are scheduled to be built in 
that development, Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very optimistic for Huntington Beach in the 1990s," he said. "We're headed 
in the right direction to take us into the 21st Century." BILL BILLITER

VOTERS TO BE ASKED TO OK SCHOOL BONDS

Property owners in the Los Alamitos Unified School District will be asked in a 
special election to approve a $13-million bond issue to finance school 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by voters on April 3, Measure K would require residential and 
commercial property owners in the cities of Los Alamitos and Seal Beach and the 
community of Rossmoor to pay $4.50 more in taxes a month. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds would finance such projects as painting, replacement of floors and 
roofs and other structural improvements of school buildings, said Ronald 
Murrey, director of business and support services for the district. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the schools in the district are about 30 years old," he said. "Just as 
you would need to maintain a house, these buildings need to be maintained." 
</P>
<P>
Murrey said a decrease in state funding for schools prompted the bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
"The state has been cutting back on these funds for the last few years," he 
said. "There simply is not enough to take care of deferred maintenance and 
provide all of the educational programs we currently offer." 
</P>
<P>
Those who would be exempt from the increased tax are people 65 or older and the 
disabled who receive Social Security, according to Murrey. The school board 
also voted to exclude residents of Leisure World in Seal Beach from the tax. 
</P>
<P>
"What we hope is that the community appreciates the educational system that the 
Los Alamitos school district provides," Murrey said. 
</P>
<P>
There are four elementary schools, one middle school and two high schools in 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds would be paid off in the next 20 to 25 years, Murrey said. KATHIE

<P>
FIREFIGHTERS OK PACT RAISING SALARIES 5% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ending six months of negotiations, city firefighters have agreed to a new 
four-year contract that includes a 5% annual pay increase, city officials 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The new labor agreement is retroactive to July 1 and covers 23 non-management 
fire personnel, Assistant City Manager Gregory L. Hulsizer said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the pay increase, the contract allows firefighters to retire at age 50 
instead of 55, beginning in 1993. The contract expires June 30, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
General city employees agreed to a new two-year contract in November, Hulsizer 
said. That pact, which affects 160 non-management employees, provides a 5% 
salary increase for fiscal year 1989-90 and a 4 1/2% increase for fiscal year 
1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are continuing with the city's 43-member police force. The city's 
contract with the San Clemente Peace Officers Assn. expired Sunday. The police 
union has complained that, according to a recent union survey, its members are 
the lowest-paid police officers in Orange County.

BIRD EXPERT FOCUSES ON PET PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID F. BURKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
High on a hill overlooking the city, "the bird lady" of La Habra watches over 
her flock. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie Harris' first love is the hundreds of birds she raises for sale to pet 
stores nationwide. Her second is the books and newsletters she writes about 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Harris is the author of two books, "Breeding Conures" and "Grey-Cheeked 
Parakeets and Other Brotogeris." She also publishes two newsletters and 
receives telephone calls daily from bird owners seeking advice. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I have a feathered thumb," she joked. The 35-year-old California native 
credits her expertise to common sense and experimentation for 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
Two 50-foot bird enclosures and a couple of small barns house pairs and small 
colonies of brightly colored parrots. Each day, Harris prepares a huge tub of 
fruit and vegetable chunks which she combines with various seeds to feed her 
multitude. 
</P>
<P>
The birds lay eggs in wooden nesting boxes attached to the side of each cage. 
When the eggs hatch, Harris moves the chicks into her spacious home for the 
all-important hand-feeding process. 
</P>
<P>
Wild birds can seldom be trained or accustomed to human handling, explained 
Harris. When baby birds are hand fed and given lots of attention, they become 
gentle pets. 
</P>
<P>
"People want to own birds that I have raised," she said. "I sleep with the 
little babies in my bedroom. I get up in the middle of the night to feed them." 
</P>
<P>
As a child, Harris was taken by her grandmother to a Los Angeles poultry 
market, where she developed her interest in birds. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to get rid of my first bird because my sister was allergic to them," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I ended up with hundreds of hamsters. My mother knew I had hamsters, but she 
never knew how many." Harris made her own cages and "got boxes of fruits and 
vegetables from the trash behind grocery stores. I told a cabinetmaker that I'd 
sweep his floor, and then I took the shavings home for my hamsters." 
</P>
<P>
Harris is now a speaker at gatherings of bird lovers and is scheduled to talk 
Feb. 29 at the Bird Expo at the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
When Harris speaks before groups, her favorite pet, Sunny, accompanies her. 
</P>
<P>
"His main feature is that he trusts me completely," she said. "I can stand him 
on his head, or hand him to a complete stranger, and he will remain totally 
calm." 
</P>
<P>
The La Habra Department of Community Services has asked Harris to develop a 
class for children. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be good to let kids know that the pretty bird they see in a 
pet shop will not automatically become something that they can take home and be 
happy with. Sometimes they end up getting bitten and become very unhappy. And 
the bird becomes unhappy too." 
</P>
<P>
Children will learn about feeding, nutrition and training birds. 
</P>
<P>
Harris has also won four awards for being the first to breed various species of 
parrots in the United States.DAVID F. BURKE

WOMAN GETS PROBATION IN DROWNING

<TEXT>
<P>
A 37-year-old Anaheim woman convicted of delaying the rescue of a 4-year-old 
boy who was drowning in her back-yard swimming pool has been placed on five 
years' probation and ordered to receive psychiatric treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Debra Kay Gipson's felony conviction for child endangerment involving a 
swimming pool is believed to be the first such in Orange County and one of few 
ever in the nation, according to court officials. 
</P>
<P>
Gipson, who had been convicted in 1985 of misdemeanor child abuse after beating 
her two sons for complaining that they were hungry, was also ordered to pay 
restitution to the dead boy's family and to stay away from children unless 
another adult is present. 
</P>
<P>
David (Trey) Smith, a neighborhood boy, fell into Gipson's pool last June 17. 
He was pronounced dead at Childrens Hospital of Orange County five days later. 
</P>
<P>
Scott D'Errico, Gipson's next door neighbor, testified at the penalty trial 
Wednesday that Gipson panicked and ran away, abandoning her own two children, 
as D'Errico and another person tried to rescue the boy from the pool. 
</P>
<P>
"She was standing there when we jumped in to get the kid," D'Errico said during 
an interview Thursday. "But it took two tries to pull him out, and by the time 
we did, she was long gone." 
</P>
<P>
Gipson was arrested more than a month later while hitchhiking in Northern 
California. She was convicted of felony child endangerment in December. 
</P>
<P>
Though she did not testify at her trial, Gipson told a probation officer that 
she felt that she was not responsible for the boy's death because she did not 
tell him to get into the pool. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Jean M. Rheinheimer said that Gipson, who faced up to six 
years in prison, would not receive adequate psychiatric care in prison. The 
judge worried that Gipson would return to her children with the same 
psychological problems. The children are living with their father. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathleen Harper said she agreed with the court that Gipson 
was in need of psychiatric care but felt that Gipson deserved a harsher 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"We pursued charges for this case because of the variety of disturbing 
circumstances that surrounded it," Harper said. "She certainly needs help, but 
in this situation, the incident outweighed that and deserved severe 
punishment." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Lewis Clapp asked the court for probation and added that 
Gipson was in protective custody to prevent assaults from other inmates.

FOUNTAIN VALLEY MAN'S DEATH PUTS 'DEAD' CONCERTS IN DOUBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The future of Grateful Dead concerts at the Forum here is in limbo this week as 
representatives of the city, the arena and the rock band hold discussions about 
last month's concert, after which a Fountain Valley teen-ager died in police 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
The Grateful Dead have a city permit to perform Feb. 9, 10 and 11 at the Forum, 
but the group has not yet signed a contract for the performance, Forum 
spokesman Bob Steiner said. According to a lawyer for the teen-ager's family, 
more than two dozen Grateful Dead fans have contacted him to say they witnessed 
the arrest of Patrick Shanahan, a 19-year-old college student from Fountain 
Valley, at the Dec. 10 Inglewood concert. The lawyer, Lawrence Trygstad of Los 
Angeles, who has been retained to investigate Shanahan's death, said witnesses 
generally described the police behavior that night as "very aggressive and 
brutal." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County district attorney's office is investigating police 
conduct during the arrest. Police say Shanahan was held in a chokehold after 
resisting arrest. An autopsy indicated that Shanahan died from neck injuries; 
multiple injuries and LSD intoxication were listed as contributing causes. 
</P>
<P>
Police challenged suggestions that officers used excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
Police made 24 arrests, most of them drug related, during the three-day 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got several hundred people on hallucinogenic drugs at the same time," 
Sgt. Harold Moret said. "There are four or five incidents happening at one 
time. Officers are running from one wrestling match to another wrestling match. 
</P>
<P>
"In these wild fights, the officers were using whatever force was necessary 
with these guys that were blasted out of their minds on hallucinogenic drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood City Councilman Jose Fernandez said banning the Dead from the Forum 
"remains a viable option that must be looked at very closely." But neither he 
nor other officials openly called for a ban on the Dead in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unacceptable to have that kind of drug dealing and usage in public," 
Fernandez said. "I will not tolerate it." 
</P>
<P>
Forum General Manager Claire Rothman, Police Chief Raymond Johnson, City 
Manager Paul Eckles and a Grateful Dead representative have been discussing the 
"advisability of the Grateful Dead playing here or not playing here," Steiner 
said.

MIKE PENNER: SAN JOSE ST. STARTS LONG CLIMB BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With Nevada Las Vegas again representing the northern-most in basketball 
quality, the big news in the Big West can be found at the southern end of the 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
There's a new worst team in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
And its name isn't San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
That final score on the Bren Center scoreboard Thursday night -- San Jose 75, 
UC Irvine 69 -- is for real. The basketball program that all but gave itself 
the death penalty last season is not only fogging the mirror, but has a pulse 
beating strong enough now to beat once-decent teams on their home court. 
</P>
<P>
If this evening meant more heartburn for Irvine's Bill Mulligan, whose 
incredible shrinking team is now 2-9, it meant history for San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since last Jan. 3, the Spartans won a conference game -- 
ending a streak of 17 consecutive Big West defeats. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since Jan. 14 of 1988, the Spartans won a conference game on 
the road -- ending a 16-game streak. 
</P>
<P>
And for the first time since the 1987-88 season, the Spartans can look down in 
the conference standings and see another face staring back. 
</P>
<P>
At 4-7, San Jose has become a genuine success story in this season in college 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
About this time last year, the San Jose program was rocked by mutiny, with 10 
players staging a midseason walkout and demanding the removal of then-head 
coach Bill Berry. Berry stayed, long enough, at least, to finish 5-23 with a 
patchwork roster of football players and team managers. But soon after the 
season, he, too, was gone and former USC Coach Stan Morrison enlisted to build 
anew. 
</P>
<P>
If the cupboard inherited by Morrison wasn't entirely bare, it certainly gave 
new meaning to the term San Jose spartan. Only three players made the 
transition from spring to fall and when four of the Gang of Ten petitioned to 
rejoin the team this October, Morrison decided to veto it and damn the 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"I did it for two reasons," Morrison says. "First, I did it in the best 
interest of the (four) players. I didn't want them to be saddled with 10 tons 
of bricks -- 'Oh, he's one of those guys.' At least this way, each of them can 
continue their college experience without that hanging over them. 
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, I couldn't give credence to that kind of action. You don't walk 
away. That doesn't solve the problem. If you have a problem with a coach, 
that's why schools have a campus ombudsman." 
</P>
<P>
What Morrison was left with was a collection of guards as slow as they are 
small and a crazy quilt of postmen candidates. 
</P>
<P>
One, in fact, actually, was a post man. His name is Kenne Young. Last year, he 
worked for the United Parcel Service. This year, Morrison calls him his best 
player. 
</P>
<P>
"Of our five postmen," Morrison says, "none of them played last year. Three 
didn't even practice. 
</P>
<P>
"One guy had a full-time job with UPS. One guy was a redshirt walk-on. Two guys 
were Prop. 48 kids (academically ineligible). And the other played in high 
school last year -- and was not a starter." 
</P>
<P>
Morrison says he likes a challenge and sincerely wanted to get back into 
coaching, but does anybody really miss anything this much? 
</P>
<P>
"A friend of mine -- who shall go nameless -- saw a few of our first practices 
and knew our schedule," Morrison said. "He told me, 'You can't win a game. Are 
you ready for this?' " 
</P>
<P>
Morrison wasn't sure. And for four games, neither were the Spartans, whose 0-4 
start stretched the team's losing streak to 21 over two seasons. The school 
record, 22, seemed destined to fall. 
</P>
<P>
But on Dec. 11, San Jose stunned TCU, 70-69, and then came back with 
back-to-back victories over Santa Clara and Idaho State. Three victories in a 
row -- and a reason to believe. 
</P>
<P>
"We're like an expansion team," Morrison says with a grin. "We have a few guys 
we picked up on waivers -- and a few guys still on injured reserve." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's victory at the Bren Center was typical of the new San Jose style -- 
which, in itself, is anti-style. The Spartans don't do anything particularly 
well except work up a sweat. But against Irvine, that was more than enough. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to play -- and we played," Morrison said, groping for any kind of 
compliment for the troops. "We played hard for 40 minutes. We didn't play 
technically well for 40 minutes, but we played hard. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy for the players. They deserved something to keep their heads up. . . 
. Right now, the big thing is just to win a game. At home, on the road, in my 
backyard -- it's a big deal, whenever we win." 
</P>
<P>
Morrison estimates the rebuilding project will take "three to four years," so 
patience will have to be a San Jose virtue. But, already, the Spartans have 
matched their Big West victory total of last season and last place, at least 
temporarily, has been vacated. 
</P>
<P>
Do they know how to play in San Jose? 
</P>
<P>
They're getting there, they're getting there.

UC IRVINE HITS ROCK BOTTOM IN 75-69 LOSS

<P>
Coach Bill Mulligan stood, hands on hips, in front of the UC Irvine bench 
trying to make sense of what was happening on the Bren Center court Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes after watching San Jose State pull away for its first Big West 
Conference victory in 18 games, Mulligan still couldn't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine hit rock bottom with a 75-69 loss to San Jose before 2,017. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, this was a new low in a season chock full of lows. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we're the weakest team in the league, no question about it," 
Mulligan said. "We gotta make some adjustments. It's the same old story." 
</P>
<P>
It was an ugly story again Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters shot a season-low 36.9% from the field, 53.8% from the free-throw 
line and had 20 turnovers, which figured prominently in their fourth 
consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine fell to 2-9 overall, 0-2 in the Big West. San Jose is 4-7, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
"My stomach is going crazy," Mulligan said. "I know I look real cool. I don't 
understand the shooting. We free-lanced a little too much." 
</P>
<P>
San Jose didn't exactly bring the sport to new heights either. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans shot 46% from the field and blew an eight-point lead late in the 
game before getting the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"That was beautiful," San Jose Coach Stan Morrison said, tongue planted firmly 
in cheek. "That was one of the most artistic things I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Then, taking a more serious tone, he added, "I'm glad we won. The kids deserve 
to have something to keep their heads up." 
</P>
<P>
Andre Brooks had a game-high 22 points to lead Morrison's rebuilding project. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison, who coached USC from 1980-86, had to start from scratch when he took 
the San Jose job last April. A player boycott midway through last season to 
protest then-coach Bill Berry had left the Spartans' ranks depleted. 
</P>
<P>
He had just three players left from last season's 5-23 team and had to bring in 
15 newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks, one of the new faces, had 11 of his 22 in the first seven minutes of 
the second half to push San Jose into the lead, 48-44. 
</P>
<P>
The lead had changed hands until then. Irvine led, 34-33, at halftime, only the 
third time this season they had the lead after 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine made one late run at San Jose, erasing an eight-point lead but couldn't 
pull ahead after tying the score, 59-59, with 4:17 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters suddenly went cold, failing to score for the next 3:09. Craig 
Marshall's free throw finally broke the streak, but Irvine trailed, 67-60. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose guard Tom Desiano kept Irvine behind by making six free throws in the 
final 1:05. Desiano, who played at Mission Viejo High School, had 12 points and 
seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
Center Ricky Butler led Irvine with 17 points. Forwards Justin Anderson and 
Jeff Herdman each had 12. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're headed for the cellar this year," Butler said. "Everyone's 
looking at us as a win." 
</P>
<P>
It's not difficult to see why. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters shot less than 40% for the third consecutive game, were three 
above their turnover average and generally made a mess of things when they had 
a chance to overtake San Jose late. 
</P>
<P>
Dwain Daniels made two free throws to give San Jose the lead, 61-59. Desiano 
added two more, then swiped the ball from Herdman and drove in for a layup and 
a 65-59 lead with 2:31 left. 
</P>
<P>
Troy Batiste added two more free throws with 1:23 left and the Spartans held a 
secure, 67-59, lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what it is," Butler said. "We can't put it in the hole. It's 
like, 'Wow, we're down again.' We play good for a while, then play bad and the 
guys get down." 
</P>
<P>
So now Irvine travels to Fresno State on Sunday, where the Anteaters ended an 0 
for 12 losing streak at Selland Arena with an 82-79 victory last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we'll get a win on the road," Butler said. "It's not going to be 
too good at Fresno." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the schedule only gets more difficult for Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you think I know that," Mulligan said softly when reminded. "I know 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
How big of a victory was it for San Jose State? Not only did it break a 17-game 
conference losing streak, it also broke a two-year conference losing streak. 
The victory also was the first for the Spartans at Irvine since a 73-59 victory 
over the Anteaters in Crawford Hall in 1983. . . . Irvine's woes continue at 
home. The loss was the Anteaters' 10th in the past 12 games dating back to last 
season.

Del Taco/Naugles Inc., the nation's second-largest Mexican-style fast food 
chain, was acquired Thursday in a management buyout that threatens to 
resuscitate the taco war with rival Taco Bell. 
</P>
<P>
A four-member management group, headed by company President Wayne W. Armstrong, 
acquired the privately held chain from Newport Beach restaurateur Anwar Soliman 
for an undisclosed price. Industry analysts estimated the deal's value at $100 
million to $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the transaction, Armstrong also said Del Taco/Naugles would 
return "to its traditional fast-food roots" by lowering prices and serving 
smaller portions. The company also plans to return to 24-hour service in many 
of its 350 outlets. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition comes less than two years after Soliman bought Del Taco and 
Naugles and upgraded their menus with more expensive and elaborate offerings. 
</P>
<P>
The deal also coincides with efforts by Soliman to raise $100 million through 
the issuance of junk bonds to increase his stake in American Restaurant Group, 
which owns 360 restaurants including the Stuart Anderson's Black Angus chain. 
</P>
<P>
Soliman wants to buy out a large stake that GE Credit Corp. holds in ARG, 
industry sources said. He has been unable to raise the money because of the 
slump in the junk bond market. Those sources said the sale of Del Taco/Naugles 
is likely designed to help buy out GE. 
</P>
<P>
Soliman could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, GE Credit financed the buyout by Del Taco management: Armstrong, 
who is also chief executive officer, and three corporate vice presidents -- 
John Crofton, Harold Fox and Paul W. Hitzelberger. The four are equal partners 
in the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
How much cash Soliman raised is unclear -- the deal was structured so that 
Armstrong and his partners paid only part of the price in cash. Soliman also 
received notes, unspecified "other interests" and the right to develop and 
operate Del Taco and Naugles restaurants in Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia, 
Taiwan, Japan and the Republic of Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, who was president of Del Taco when Soliman bought the operation in 
March, 1988, and combined it with the smaller Naugles chain, said the new 
owners plan to make some quick changes in operations. 
</P>
<P>
That could mean a resumption of the so-called taco war launched in 1988 when 
Soliman combined the two smaller chains and tried to challenge Taco Bell's 
supremacy. But in rekindling the competition, Armstrong and his team are 
repudiating Soliman's vision of an upscale fast food chain. 
</P>
<P>
The company's return to its roots was launched over the weekend as new items -- 
most of them downsized versions of the larger and higher-priced items that have 
been on the menu for the past two years -- were added to the menu boards of the 
290 Del Tacos and 25 Naugles in California, the 34 Naugles in Utah, Nevada, 
Missouri and Arizona and the single Del Taco in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Under Soliman, the Del Taco and Naugles menus -- and prices -- had been raised 
and, Armstrong acknowledged Thursday, the chain had begun losing customers to 
rival Taco Bell, which at the same time lowered prices. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong said that the new owners plan to have most of the chain's restaurants 
open 24 hours a day by the end of March. Most of the stores now close at 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Del Taco/Naugles has 350 restaurants and estimated gross annual sales of $250 
million. It has about an 11% share of the national market for Mexican fast-food 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Taco Bell, the Irvine-based unit of Pepsico, is the largest Mexican-style fast 
food chain in the country with more than 3,000 restaurants nationally and about 
70% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the company repeated its long-held position that Del Taco/Naugles 
is not and has never been considered a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
"Taco Bell is No. 8 on the (Restaurant Hospitality magazine) list of fast 
feeders," said company spokesman Elliot Bloom. "Del Taco is somewhere in the 
80s. . . . We consider McDonald's our competition, not Del Taco." 
</P>
<P>
But Del Taco/Naugles certainly considers Taco Bell -- with 620 restaurants in 
California -- to be major competition. 
</P>
<P>
"We went too far" in the taco war in 1988, Armstrong said. When Del 
Taco/Naugles began advertising itself as an alternative to Taco Bell, the 
bigger chain's products "were a little smaller and a little cheaper than ours," 
he said. "And then we went upscale at same time they went downscale" and 
introduced a line of 59-cent items. 
</P>
<P>
"They zigged when we zagged, and the difference in price became so great that 
the really price-sensitive customer went to Taco Bell," Armstrong said. "We had 
moved too far upscale, almost to the sit-down restaurant stage. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now saying that we really are a quick-service restaurant and are going 
to provide prices comparable to Taco Bell's pricing as well as items for those 
who want bigger items at a higher price," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of that quick-service philosophy is represented in the return to 24-hour 
operation, which makes Del Taco/Naugles the only major fast food chain in 
Southern California to be open around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1988, Naugles had operated on a 24-hour basis for years, "and Del Taco 
was getting into it in a big way," Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
Soliman quashed that. 
</P>
<P>
"But we are a mass merchandiser," Armstrong said. "And we think there is a 
market for us between midnight and 8 a.m. It is like what the supermarkets did 
a few years back. People can think of us as a restaurant they can go to at any 
time of the day." 
</P>
<P>
Operating 24 hours daily can be a risky business because the market for 
post-midnight fast foods is a limited one at best, said Michael G. Mueller, an 
industry analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"But if you are going to do it, Southern California is the best place to try," 
he said.

LOCAL PHONE COMPANIES FEELING HEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pacific Bell, GTE California and the state's 20-odd other local phone companies 
still enjoy virtual monopolies in their respective service areas. But that is 
changing -- in ways that promise to revolutionize the way consumers and 
businesses buy and receive phone service. 
</P>
<P>
In the same way that giant American Telephone &amp; Telegraph has lost market 
share to smaller upstarts in the long-distance business, a handful of 
entrepreneurial competitors are asking regulators to open local phone markets 
further to competition. That will enable them to cash in on a growing business 
and chip away at the market shares enjoyed by Pacific Bell and other local 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
So far, such increased competition is minimal. But the prospect of its growth 
was a major factor cited by Pacific Telesis on Thursday in announcing that it 
will cut 16% of its work force in the next five years, mostly in its Pacific 
Bell unit. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the next five years, it's etched very keenly in everybody's minds 
that we have to do this to remain competitive," said Pacific Telesis 
spokeswoman Amy Damianakes. 
</P>
<P>
An example of the new breed of competitor is Metropolitan Fiber Service, a 
2-year-old private venture that offers local connections to big business in a 
dozen U.S. cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"Our competition today is in what is designated as special access only, a very 
small part of the total access (provided by) the Bell operating companies," 
said George Tronsrue, a vice president of Metropolitan Fiber Systems. 
</P>
<P>
Its local links connect major telecommunications users, such as brokerages and 
other financial institutions, to the long-distance carriers of their choice, 
bypassing local public networks run by Pacific Bell and other local phone 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan Fiber Systems, based in the Chicago suburb of Oakbrook, Ill., 
installs its switching system in the heart of a major metropolitan area -- 800 
W. 6th St. in Los Angeles. Then it extends high-capacity, high-fidelity optical 
fiber strands to connect surrounding buildings to one another, creating its own 
local network. This in turn is hooked to the nearby switching machines of such 
long-distance carriers as AT&amp;T, MCI, US Sprint and the more than 100 other 
more specialized long-haul companies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a small niche, but a viable business for us," Tronsrue said. "But when 
you look at what else is there, there is a significant portion of local-access 
service that we are precluded from developing." 
</P>
<P>
Building a tiny niche into a big business mirrors the genesis two decades ago 
of MCI, which began by handling private traffic by microwave between St. Louis 
and Chicago and parlayed that into opening the entire long-distance 
telecommunications market to competition. 
</P>
<P>
Now federal and state regulators are begining to lighten their control over 
AT&amp;T, which has watched its former long-distance monopoly shrink to a 
two-thirds share of the market. At the same time, MCI and US Sprint have grown 
into billion-dollar concerns themselves, and both now are also profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Metropolitan Fiber Systems has asked federal authorities to let it broaden 
its entry into local telecommunications. It seeks the right to plug its private 
customers into the Baby Bells' local networks, paying just for the part of 
local service that it needs to complete its own system. 
</P>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission also has called hearings this year 
on opening the local monopoly. Tronsrue said MFS intends to make its same 
appeal to the state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Doing so would require and the local giants to break down service into "basic 
service elements" and offer these for sale separately. But today, Tronsrue 
said, would-be competitors like MFS must pay for a connection to the local 
switching machine, which they don't need, in addition to the transportation to 
their customer's local phone lines, which they do. 
</P>
<P>
But competition is not a one way street. Pacific Bell and other Baby Bells want 
to get into other markets themselves. They are pressing Congress and the 
Federal Communications Commission to amend the nation's cable television laws 
to let them carry video signals, which they currently are prohibited to do 
within their service areas. An unregulated PacTel subsidiary already has 
entered cable TV in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about 10 years overdue," said Stuart Crane, telecommunications analyst 
with Gruntal &amp; Co. "They should have competition from the Bell companies. 
There is no reason (today) for the (1984) Cable Act." 
</P>
<P>
GTE California, under special FCC authorization, carries cable television for 
ApolloVision in Cerritos, testing the capabilities and qualities of three forms 
of transmission: traditional copper wire, coaxial (or two-way) cable and 
optical-fiber cable. As a part of that test, a handful of Cerritos households 
-- actually only five -- this year will enjoy optical-fiber links to their 
homes that will enable them to sample such services as home banking and 
shopping andcalling up movies to be viewed on demand -- services already 
available to telephone customers in France.

PACIFIC TELESIS WILL CUT 11,000 JOBS OVER FIVE YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: THE COMPANY SAYS THE COMPETITION-CAUSED REDUCTIONS WILL COME MAINLY FROM 
ITS PACIFIC BELL LOCAL TELEPHONE SUBSIDIARY. 
</P>

<P>
Pacific Telesis Group said Thursday that it will pare 11,000 of its 69,000 jobs 
-- 16% of the work force -- over the next five years to cut costs amid 
increased competition and new labor-saving technology. 
</P>
<P>
The company, the state's largest private employer, said the job cuts will come 
almost entirely from its Pacific Bell local telephone subsidiary. It said the 
reductions will be achieved through early-retirement incentives, retraining and 
attrition, but a job-seeking service will also be set up for employees 
accepting severance pay and leaving the company. 
</P>
<P>
Which jobs will be axed -- and how heavily the cuts will fall on Pacific Bell's 
28,000 Southern California employees -- remains to be determined, a spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts are among the largest in a series of reductions that have pared 17,000 
jobs from Pacific Telesis since it was created in 1984 as one of seven regional 
holding companies spun off from giant American Telephone &amp; Telegraph as 
part of an antitrust settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Telesis attributed the latest cuts to increased competition from 
upstart telephone firms that are chipping away at its monopoly and taking away 
some of its largest customers. In addition, new labor-saving telecommunications 
technology is making many jobs unneeded. 
</P>
<P>
"One person can do the job of three or four," observed Stuart Crane, an analyst 
with Gruntal &amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts also stem from a new California regulatory system that provides 
Pacific Bell incentives to reduce costs to increase profits. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying out the job-reduction program, including costs of early-retirement 
incentives, will not have a significant impact on profits, Pacific Telesis 
said. Analysts also noted that the cutback is not a sign of financial 
difficulty at the San Francisco-based firm, which is among the strongest of the 
so-called Baby Bells spun off from AT&amp;T. 
</P>
<P>
All but 50 of the jobs to be cut will come from giant Pacific Bell. The other 
50 jobs are to be cut during 1990 from Pacific Telesis' present headquarters 
staff of about 400. 
</P>
<P>
"Staffing requirements change over time in this dynamic industry," said Pacific 
Bell President Phil Quigley. "What was appropriate in 1989 clearly will not be 
in 1994." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell will lose about 7,600 non-salaried jobs and 3,400 management 
positions, he said. The job cuts do not affect Pacific Telesis' unregulated 
ventures, which are grouped under PacTel Corp. These include PacTel Cellular in 
Costa Mesa, PacTel Paging, Pacific Telesis International, PacTel Business 
Systems and PacTel Properties. 
</P>
<P>
Some layoffs will probably prove inevitable, the company acknowledged, but 
Pacific Telesis will try to minimize that by offering incentives for veteran 
employees to retire early by adding three years to both their service and their 
age in calculating pension benefits. That incentive trimmed a third of the 
management staff of Nevada Bell, a Pacific Telesis subsidiary that serves the 
Reno area. Other employees in jobs identified as surplus will be offered 
training for other posts or assignment to lower-ranking slots, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to operate even more efficiently in the 1990s, so we can deliver 
the maximum benefits to our customers and share-owners," said Sam Ginn, Pacific 
Telesis' chairman and chief executive. "Looking ahead, we remain keenly focused 
on our customers and the need to streamline operations so we can meet the 
challenges of increasing competition." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts generally welcomed the announcement but said it was no surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"The driving force of the telecommunications industry is technology," said 
analyst Crane of Gruntal &amp; Co. "Switches today are gigantic computers that 
are highly automated. They do almost anything. So all you need is people to 
supervise these massive machines and keep an eye on them." 
</P>
<P>
Another incentive to cut costs stems from a new regulatory system in California 
that requires Pacific Bell to lower costs by 4.5% a year to reflect anticipated 
labor-saving improvements from new technology. But the new system also allows 
the company to earn more, if it can, than was possible under the old system, 
which set a tight limit on profits. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, despite their present monopoly in providing local telephone service, 
Pacific Bell and the other Baby Bells already are losing some business from 
major customers, mainly financial services firms. These companies are either 
erecting microwave towers to create their own private phone system, or 
contracting with Pacific Bell or a growing number of newcomers that provide 
private links for them. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, this traffic bypasses the "public network" that most businesses and 
residential customers depend on. 
</P>
<P>
This bypassing was encouraged in California and some other states, including 
New York, when regulators opened one area of the monopoly to competition -- the 
lucrative high-speed transmission of data. Moreover, the California Public 
Utilities Commission this year will consider prying open other areas of the 
local monopoly. And the Federal Communications Commission and Congress are 
re-examining national cable television law, which presently forbids local phone 
companies to carry cable television in their service areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We may see in the next decade, more than one (local) phone company serving an 
area," suggested Steve Sazebari of the Dataquest research firm in San Jose. "In 
any case, they have to be more competitive in price and quality, so basically 
they have to cut costs." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell serve nearly 22 million people in California and 
the Reno area.

FOR A CATCHY NAME, CONSULT THE PUN &amp; BRADSTREET OF CUTE

<P>
Let's Pet is an invitation to . . . buy an animal, A Flush Beats A Full House 
does plumbing and Honest Engines repairs motors. 
</P>
<P>
Punmanship is giving American entrepreneurship a new name, says a University of 
Illinois author whose new book lists dozens of businesses nationwide that have 
been bitten by the pun bug. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Baron, a professor of English and linguistics at the Urbana campus, said 
Tuesday that what he calls "cutespeak" is a growing trend aimed at capturing 
customers' attention as well as their pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to be attracted to a place with an outrageous name," he said 
in a telephone interview. "One of the ploys of advertising is to have something 
that sticks in the consumer's mind." 
</P>
<P>
That ploy seems to work for one of Baron's favorite businesses, The Brick Shirt 
House in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally it was named because it moved into a red brick building and we sold 
T-shirts," said owner Henry Haase. "Everybody laughs when they hear it and they 
say, 'You know what it almost sounds like."' 
</P>
<P>
"It was something we figured people definitely would remember," Haase said. 
</P>
<P>
They did. The business quickly caught on and since opening about eight years 
ago has expanded and moved to larger quarters. But the store has kept the same 
logo -- a little outhouse with a T-shirt for a window. 
</P>
<P>
Dyna Sewer, a Chicago plumbing outfit that calls itself "the rooter giant," 
also says the punny name has helped business. 
</P>
<P>
"You know it does help business because it does attract peoples' attention," 
said dispatcher Dennis Weisenritter Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The company is an example of punmanship expanding into previously uncharted 
territory, because cutesy names used to be reserved mostly for restaurants and 
bars, Baron said. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't think of plumbers with a trendy name," he said, but there's the San 
Francisco-area plumber A Flush Beats A Full House. There's also a mechanic in 
the Southwest called Honest Engines and a gynecologist's office in the Chicago 
area called Ladies First. 
</P>
<P>
These are among the 100-plus businesses listed in a chapter of Baron's new 
book, "Declining Grammar," which examines various aspects of language. The book 
was published in Urbana by the National Council of Teachers of English. 
</P>
<P>
Even Baron thinks puns can go too far. 
</P>
<P>
"A good witticism is enjoyable the first time around, and sometimes the second 
or third time around," he writes. "But frequent repetition sours even the best 
of jokes, and . . . the staying power of funny names is seriously limited." 
</P>
<P>
Some names can even be embarrassing, Baron says. Take the Chicago pet store 
called "Let's Pet." 
</P>
<P>
"What's it like to work in a place like that?" Baron asked. "Do you answer the 
phone and say, 'Hello, Let's Pet?' Or maybe just have the dogs breathing 
heavily?" 
</P>
<P>
An employee who answered the phone saying, "Let's Pet" and identified himself 
only as "Bill" said he didn't know how the store got its name, and referred all 
questions to the owner, who was not in. 
</P>
<P>
Cutespeak can also be too cute. 
</P>
<P>
That was a worry of Belinda Norris and Barbara Bird when they opened their 
Boston caterer, Currier &amp; Chives. 
</P>
<P>
In creating the business 6 1/2 years ago, "We wanted it to be memorable more 
than anything else," Norris said. "I think the only objection on Barbara's part 
was that (the name) might be too cute." 
</P>
<P>
So far, no one's complained. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an incredible name for us," she said. "People have really responded 
to our name. The phone calls are usually, 'I love your name.' "

Building permits for multifamily residential units -- that's apartments and 
condos in English -- dropped a hefty 30% in the county during the first 10 
months of 1989. There were 7,200 permits issued compared to 10,300 in 1988, 
according to the Construction Industry Research Board. 
</P>
<P>
That's good news for apartment owners, who have seen vacancy rates rise and 
profits decline in the last few years.

SDC DEVELOPMENT AMONG BUYERS OF UNION PACIFIC LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Union Pacific Corp. put its massive landholdings up for sale, Koll Co. 
wasn't the only local developer that went shopping. (In the largest deal in its 
history, Koll bought a half-billion dollars worth of land and buildings from 
the railroad recently.) 
</P>
<P>
SDC Development, a much smaller neighbor of Koll's in Newport Beach, paid Union 
Pacific $16 million for an industrial park called Mira Loma Industrial Center 
in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
SDC will sell some of the 183 acres at Mira Loma and build factories and 
warehouses on the rest. In all there will eventually be 3 million square feet 
of industrial space at the park with a value of more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
"SDC considers the Mira Loma Industrial Center as the jewel of all Union 
Pacific Realty's former properties," Senior Vice President Jim Watson said in a 
press release. 
</P>
<P>
The railroad decided last year to sell thousands of acres and dozens of 
buildings around the nation in an effort to boost its stock price. The real 
estate was worth a lot, but it wasn't bringing in the big money quick enough to 
suit investors. Sure enough, the stock went up Tuesday when the Koll sale was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
If Koll bought most of the property, other companies like SDC managed to nick 
off a piece or two by getting a foot in the door before the big developer. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, SDC said it wouldn't have minded grabbing a few more pieces. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some other things we were interested in," said Charlie Kanne, vice 
president of SDC's industrial division. "But Koll bought everything they had 
left." 
</P>
<P>
SDC operates mostly in the Southwest. Its biggest project is a joint venture to 
develop 345 acres it bought a few months ago in an industrial neighborhood near 
the Irvine Spectrum, a huge office and industrial park at the junction of the 
San Diego and Santa Ana freeways in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Construction on the Mira Loma park, meanwhile, is to begin by fall.

COSMETIC SOLUTIONS VS. SKIN POLLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLETTE O'CONNOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ozone's going, the globe is warming, fossil fuels are burning and Southern 
California's more than 8 million cars, trucks and buses are coughing up a 
witch's caldron of pollutants. Pollutants that not only lend the area 
distinction as having the worst air quality in the nation, but also sting eyes, 
burn lungs and turn locally grown oranges a ghostly, ghastly shade of yellow. 
</P>
<P>
And this is a kettle of concern to certain beauty-attentive women from Brea to 
Emerald Bay who worry about smog's effect on their complexions. "Women come in 
here talking about the irritants and chemicals in the air and they wonder, 'I 
know it's damaging my lungs, but what's it doing to my skin?' " observes Marcy 
Shannon, 43, manager of the Estee Lauder cosmetics counter at Buffums, Newport 
Beach. "They want to know how to protect themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Enter the ritzy, trend-alert cosmetics firms. Having successfully 
wind-resisted, weather-fended and sun-proofed many of their tony lotions and 
often costly creams to sell themselves to consumers, some are now hoping to 
offer further skin protection -- against pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Chanel, for example, has introduced Prevention Serum (price: $50 for 1.35 
ounces), which promises to fight "environmental impurities and emissions from 
cars and other pollutants." Estee Lauder offers Skin Defender ($45 for 0.9 
ounces) to provide a barrier against "environmental chemicals, irritants and 
oxidants before they can affect skin's appearance." 
</P>
<P>
This appeals to the women who are rushing to the Estee Lauder counter at such 
stores as Bullocks Wilshire in Fashion Island. Counter manager Nicole Williams 
says they're "grabbing (Skin Defender) up because once they try it, they love 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Some local dermatologists and specialists on aging, such as Dr. Lord Lee-Benner 
of Newport Beach, think the claims of these products are a lot of hooey. 
</P>
<P>
"It sure sounds fabulous, but it just doesn't work on paper," says Lee-Benner, 
the author of the medical school textbook, "A Physician's Guide to Aging, the 
Immune System and Free Radical Damage." "A product that claims to protect skin 
against pollution is a waste of money. It probably feels good. It's fun; it's 
sexy. But it's not doing a thing." 
</P>
<P>
Tell that to such respected cosmetic powerhouses as Chanel, which claims "you 
can't be too rich or too thin . . . or too young-looking." Touting its 
Prevention Serum as a shield against the appearance of future lines and 
wrinkles, the company states its product "neutralizes free radicals which are 
caused by environmental impurities." The company maintains that free radicals, 
which are molecules or atoms found in hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides from 
paints, solvents, refineries and autos, are damaging to skin and its collagen 
and elastin support system. 
</P>
<P>
The Estee Lauder Co., as well, says that while only 20% of visible aging is 
chronological, fully 80% of a woman's facial sags, bags, creases and crow's 
feet are caused by the environment. And its Skin Defender's "Tri-level defense 
strategy" will take on the invisible daily onslaught of irritants, chemicals, 
oxidants, wind and sun -- the "inescapable enemies (which) trigger harmful 
chemical chain reactions the moment they touch the skin's surface." 
</P>
<P>
Most physicians would agree with majordomos in the beauty business that drying 
wind and damaging sun are among the worst elements to ride a woman's dewy, 
youthful looks out of town -- and down a road to ruin paved with age-blaring 
wrinkles and such skin disorders as spider veins, sun allergies (with their 
itchy or blistery rashes), abnormally pigmented "age spots" and even 
life-threatening malignant melanoma, or skin cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The sun is especially dreaded, say experts, which explains why the "active" 
ingredient in Estee Lauder's Skin Defender is DEA-methoxycinnamate, a sun 
blocker. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem for men and women, from a gorgeous point of view, is 
protection not from smog but from the sun," says Dr. Gerald Weinstein, 
professor and chairman of the dermatology department at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, say experts, the sun's ultraviolet radiation penetrates through the 
skin's outer layer, or epidermis, deeper into the dermis, where it relentlessly 
breaks down elastin, the rubber-bandlike tissue that supports the skin and 
maintains its smooth, youthful structure. 
</P>
<P>
And while experts agree improper skin care can play a role in the appearance of 
frowning's furrows, smiling's lines or a leathery tone, some dermatologists 
part company over cosmetic company claims that they can take on environmental 
hazards produced by carbon monoxide-belching Buicks -- and worse. 
</P>
<P>
"I am dumbfounded," says Fullerton dermatologist Bruce Mills of a cosmetic 
preparation that claims to "neutralize" subtly harmful effects to the skin of 
free radicals, whose presence in the Los Angeles area atmosphere violated 
federal air quality standards for such pollutants on 232 days of 1988. "We know 
free radicals can damage skin, but from the inside. Free radicals on the 
outside, in the environment doing harm? I'm at a loss (to understand how)," 
Mills says. 
</P>
<P>
Free radicals are everywhere: in ultraviolet light, cigarette smoke, and even 
in the body as a result of normal metabolic functions. Because they are atoms 
with an extra ionic charge that makes them "unbalanced" and magnetic, they 
attach to other unbalanced atoms to become whole. Unattached free radicals 
within the body can alter the molecular structure of cells in their quest for 
wholeness, says Dr. Lee-Benner, going even so far as to alter the DNA structure 
of the gene. When the cell divides to repair itself after any kind of assault 
(such as sunburn or overindulgence in alcohol) it can't do so as effectively, 
which begins the breakdown of the body, disease and aging. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the research into AIDS and immune disorders, we're just in the last 
10 years becoming aware of (the nature and extent) of free radical damage," 
Lee-Benner says. He adds that available research reveals that the best way to 
disarm these meddling molecules is by ensuring your body has enough 
"anti-oxidants," said to be vitamins A, B, C, E, and the minerals zinc and 
selenium, among others. "Anti-oxidants gobble up free radicals," Lee-Benner 
says, "and the only way to protect your skin is to take them orally" through 
supplements or a balanced, nutrient-rich diet. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, such advertised miracle workers as Vitamin E oils or B-rich creams 
are useless free-radical-busters when applied topically, experts say. "The 
vitamins in cream are like 0.1% of the ingredients, and the amount that is able 
to penetrate the skin is 100th of 1% -- not much," says Dr. James Fulton, the 
Newport Beach dermatologist who co-developed Retin-A, the Vitamin A derivative 
that might offer hope for repair of age- and sun-damaged skin. "While 
anti-oxidants in cosmetic products could neutralize free radicals in theory, 
they become insignificant in cream. You're better off pumping yourself full of 
(vitamins) C and E." 
</P>
<P>
After all, says Fulton, free radicals are extremely short-lived substances. 
"Those in smog likely have reacted to other contaminants in the environment 
long before they hit your skin." 
</P>
<P>
The question, of course, remains: What effect does smog's chemical irritants 
have on moisturized, sun-protected Southern California faces? Says Weinstein of 
UC Irvine: "There is no evidence these materials can even penetrate the skin; 
they merely sit on it like dirt." 
</P>
<P>
Weinstein adds that lotions and potions said to create a "barrier" between the 
skin and the environment are unnecessary. "Skin itself is the best barrier 
there is against environmental irritants," Weinstein says. "It acts as a sort 
of Saran Wrap" that keeps harmful elements at bay -- without cosmetic help. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim dermatologist Gary Hardegen says such products, most of which are 
formulated with oil, may even retain higher concentrations of pollutants on the 
skin than if it were left in its natural state. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if you have a fraction of a millimeter of cream or powder or makeup on 
your skin," Hardegen says, "as soon as you step out into the smog it will 
quickly equilibrate." That is, the concentration of chemicals in the cream will 
build up until it equals that of the air. And, he says, they will be held 
there, mixed with the grime of city life, clogging pores and contributing to 
what some dermatologists say is a current "epidemic" of adult acne. 
</P>
<P>
"When you leave the polluted area and go to the beach, you're still wearing 
smog cream," says Hardegen, who believes that "naked" skin dressed skimpily in 
moisturizer (if dry) and essential sun block is the best protection against 
environmental impurities. 
</P>
<P>
Healthy skin regenerates itself completely every 30 days -- shedding the dead, 
dull and dirty skin and presenting a fresh face to the world. Healthy 
complexions also naturally manufacture a protective layer of bacteria that is 
the skin's own shield to germs. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Weinstein, smog can even have a positive effect on Southern 
California complexions under siege by the sun. It's a small benefit gained from 
the lung-burning gunk, he says, but "smog stops some of the ultraviolet rays 
from getting through. It can act as a sunscreen of sorts." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, this is not to say the Southern California life style is not a 
beauty spoiler. Like improper skin care (using harsh and irritating soaps) and 
lax dietary habits (eating junk foods barren of nutrients), indoor dry heat, 
outdoor low humidity, dirt, dust and other unseen enemies in the air contribute 
to dull skin, dryness, irritation, blackheads, acne and other complexion 
assaults. 
</P>
<P>
But smog, says Dr. Weinstein, is nothing special from a beautiful complexion's 
point of view. "I don't know of any information that smog has affected the body 
by penetrating the skin. The problem is all in what you inhale." 
</P>
<P>
Despite expert opinions, beauty seekers may not retreat from cosmetic counters. 
Says Estee Lauder's Williams of those intrigued by the company's new anti-smog 
product, "Women love to try something new and different. It's part of the fun."

ODE TO THE CIGAR; 
</P>
<P>
FOR SOME, PUFFING A STOGIE CAN BE AN ALMOST-RELIGIOUS RITUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In an era when cigarettes have become tantamount to nuclear waste, it takes a 
bit of guts tolight up a cigar. 
</P>
<P>
There is, after all, precious little middle ground for the stogie. You love 'em 
or hate 'em. People see the cigar either as fragrant and satisfying, a spur to 
conversation and the philosophical mind, or they revile it as an odious clump 
of noxious weeds. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, cigar smokers tend to be both devoted and clannish, having felt 
the same transcendent pleasure in watching a soft cloud of blue smoke curl away 
from the end of their Montecruz corona and that prickly feeling when the glares 
of nonsmokers bore in. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, encounters among the committed are inevitable, thanks to a 
former Cuban refugee, a genial hotelier, a growing fraternity of cigar smokers 
and a social climate in which the cigar is tolerated, if not always embraced. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't at all unlikely, for instance, that chance meetings of the faithful 
might occur in a tiny shop on East 1st Street in Santa Ana. It is there that 
Pablo Frias presses and hand-rolls an average of 400 cigars of various sizes, 
shapes and blends each day. He is the only cigar maker in Orange County and one 
of only a handful in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Frias learned his trade at age 7 when his family lived outside of Havana and 
his brothers were tobacco planters. He left Cuba in 1955 and set up shop in 
Miami. He moved to Santa Ana in 1972 and opened the Teri Cigar Co., named for 
his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
For 17 years, he has been providing tobacco shops throughout the United States 
-- including the one at Disneyland -- with his Cubanakan cigars, the best of 
which are blends of Dominican and Honduran tobaccos. His stock is priced from 
75 cents to $2.50 per cigar, and he occasionally rolls individual blends on 
request. 
</P>
<P>
The process is simple, but elegant. Frias removes the leaves from bales, blends 
them by hand and fits them into wooden molds, where they are pressed into the 
various shapes and lengths. The cigars are then removed and Frias deftly 
encloses them in a wrapper leaf, which he cuts and seals by hand. 
</P>
<P>
Among cigar fans, he is considered a precious commodity. Frias says his 
handiwork tends to turn up regularly in the pockets of attorneys and others who 
work at the nearby Orange County Courthouse. And many local residents and 
business people have remained faithful customers for years. 
</P>
<P>
One of them is Dennis Martin, 48, a Santa Ana real estate appraiser, who said 
he goes through perhaps 50 of Frias' larger coronas "every week to 10 days. I 
like the big ones, and I don't even know what they call them. They're pretty 
good-sized cigars." 
</P>
<P>
Martin, like many cigar aficionados, never smoked cigarettes ("They just smell 
dry to me"). Two of his uncles smoked cigars, he said, and when he took up the 
practice "when I was about 15 or 16," it was love at first puff. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the smell of it, which a lot of people hate," Martin said. "And the 
flavor. A lot of people don't understand that you don't inhale them. It's the 
flavor from the smoke that does it for you. It's like eating a good steak." 
</P>
<P>
Which is exactly what Henry Schielein arranged last April. 
</P>
<P>
Schielein, vice president and general manager of the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Dana 
Point -- a man for whom cigar smoking is a pleasure bordering on the religious 
-- has become a kind of patron saint of Orange County cigar lovers, largely as 
a result of a lavish "smoker" he threw nine months ago at the hotel for 60 
lovers of the leaf. 
</P>
<P>
The evening was designed to commemorate the dedication of one of the hotel's 
rooms, known as the Library, as a smoking room where pipe and cigar smokers 
could enjoy their tobacco after dinner in the evenings (during the day, it is 
used as a nonsmoking tea room). 
</P>
<P>
For $175, the guests got a lavish steak dinner and a chance to fire up (and 
take home) some of the more than 1,000 cigars provided for the evening by 
various cigar manufacturers and distributors. Schielein said he wants to make 
the smoker an annual event, and has scheduled another one for April. He has 
received several letters from cigar lovers angling for invitations, but he said 
the guest list will be necessarily limited. He doesn't want to lose the 
comradely atmosphere that he says is part of the cigar mystique. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the perfect room for smoking," said Schielein, waving an arm at the 
darkly paneled Library. "I think it sets a mood. You don't light a cigar if 
you're in a hurry. You sit back and you enjoy it. You can smoke here without 
worrying about somebody getting upset. That's the critical thing. (The Library) 
has been favorably received because there are an awful lot of guys who like a 
good cigar." 
</P>
<P>
Schielein began his love affair with the leaf when he was a 21-year-old steward 
on a cruise ship that had put into Havana Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"We got off the ship and hit this bar, the Two Brothers Bar, and inside on the 
bar there was a box of cigars," he said. "I'd never had one in my life. I lit 
one up and fell in love." 
</P>
<P>
It is, however, not a universal love, as Joseph De Franco, whom Schielein calls 
"a cigar fanatic," has found. 
</P>
<P>
"You must take care that you don't offend someone else," said De Franco, a 
Corona del Mar resident who is the president and chief executive officer of a 
hazardous waste treatment business. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll always ask permission to smoke them. On several occasions when a 
restaurant manager has said that smoking was permitted, the owner has come out 
and said, 'My God, that's a terrible smell,' and so I apologize and let the 
cigar go out. I don't want my pleasure to be someone else's displeasure." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are restaurants and hotels in Orange County where cigar smoking is 
permitted, if on a smaller and less visible scale than at the Ritz-Carlton. 
</P>
<P>
At the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach, for instance, cigar smoking is 
permitted in the Pavilion dining room and cigars are available to diners on 
request. 
</P>
<P>
And at the Chez Cary restaurant in Orange, a selection of cigars is kept behind 
the bar for patrons who ask for them. 
</P>
<P>
Other restaurants, however, forbid cigar smoking. At the Ritz restaurant in 
Newport Beach "we really discourage cigar smoking," said day manager Judy 
Simpson. "It does nothing to enhance your dining. On the menus, we have a 
little blurb that says that we request that pipe and cigar smoking be confined 
to the lounge and bar area." 
</P>
<P>
The European tradition of restaurants routinely offering after-dinner cigars to 
their patrons is nearly non-existent in America today, Schielein said, and 
statistics bear that out. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Washington-based Cigar Assn. of America, cigar smoking has 
been on the decline in the United States, at a rate of about 8% a year since 
the U.S. surgeon general's report on smoking was published in 1964. In that 
year, more than 8.9 billion cigars were sold nationwide. In 1988, that figure 
had dropped to slightly more than 2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
(Health risks are substantially less for cigar smokers than for cigarette 
smokers, cigar fanciers are quick to point out. An American Cancer Society 
study published in 1982 found that while the risk of getting any form of cancer 
is twice as high for cigarette smokers as for nonsmokers, that risk goes up by 
only a third for cigar smokers.) 
</P>
<P>
Still, new cigar smokers are emerging. "There are a lot of young guys out there 
who like a good cigar," Schielein said. "It's not for old men only." 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Wagner, president of the Cigar Warehouse, a pair of Los Angeles stores 
specializing in cigars, said his business is "up by about 30% from last year. 
Our business used to be older men, but we're getting younger people now. Most 
of our business is with young executives in their late 20s or early 30s. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sign of success to them. Generally speaking, they're given a promotion, 
or they see the senior partner smoking a cigar, or they see executives higher 
up than they are smoking a cigar, or they're given a cigar at a meeting by 
someone who has prestige, or they see Bill Cosby or David Letterman or Milton 
Berle or George Burns smoking cigars and they want to be like these successful 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County tobacconists said that they also are serving younger customers 
and that they generally go for higher-priced imported cigars, some in the $9 to 
$10 range. Eric Root, manager of the Tinder Box in the Orange Mall, which also 
sells pipe tobacco, said "29% of my weekly business is in cigars, and that's a 
substantial amount of the business we do." 
</P>
<P>
And, say cigar lovers, the novices eventually find themselves part of a kind of 
fraternal sub-strata of smokers, with new signs and rituals. 
</P>
<P>
"I smoke a cigar maybe six times a year, and I usually buy them from the Teri 
Cigar Co.," said R.D. Ferguson, a 33-year-old investment banker from Anaheim. 
"And I only do it when I'm with the guys. I never smoke by myself. It's a 
cliche, but I suppose it's just male bonding. And I like the taste. It's a 
pleasant bite, and it's relaxing." 
</P>
<P>
Few women smoke cigars, but many say they like the smell, Schielein said. And 
there are others who pursue the leaf more actively. 
</P>
<P>
"No question, there are a lot of women who like good cigars, particularly small 
cigars," Schielein said. "In Boston, a group of women have their own little 
cigar club at the Ritz-Carlton there, and one of the members is Anwar Sadat's 
daughter. She's a cigar fanatic." 
</P>
<P>
Schielein's own marriage, he said, was contingent on his wife's attitude toward 
cigars. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a deal with my wife before we got married," he said. "I said, 'Don't 
ever ask me to stop smoking cigars.' I wouldn't have gotten married if she had. 
We've been married more than 25 years." 
</P>
<P>
There is even a kind of missionary zeal among cigar lovers, De Franco believes. 
</P>
<P>
"A cigar smoker will share his leaf with other people," he said. "I smoke about 
five or six a day and generally give away that many or more a week." 
</P>
<P>
And, Schielein said, a kind of collect-'em-trade-'em ritual exists because "a 
cigar smoker, when he smells a good cigar, is not afraid to come up to you and 
ask what you're smoking." 
</P>
<P>
It all contributes, he said, to a devotion that few inanimate objects enjoy. 
And it is surely a sign of that deep feeling that Schielein can quote Mark 
Twain on the subject of cigars and appear to agree with every single word: 
</P>
<P>
"If I cannot smoke cigars in heaven," Twain wrote, "I shall not go."

ANN CONWAY: RESTAURATEUR'S NOUVELLE IDEA IS 'BREAKFAST CLUB' FOR RISING STARS 
</P>

Danny DeVito is a regular. So is O.J. Simpson. And Donald Bren. 
</P>
<P>
Super model Lauren Hutton has dined there. So has super actress Bette Midler 
(when she was filming "Beaches" at Crystal Cove). And baseball great Reggie 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
And so will former President Ronald Reagan, come spring, when a benefit for his 
presidential library is held at the Newport Beach version of Five Feet, the 
Laguna Beach restaurant on the tip of every savvy tongue. 
</P>
<P>
If you're a place-watcher, keep your eye on Five Feet and its sister 
restaurant, Five Feet Too (site of a 1989 visit by Vice President Dan Quayle) 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Owner-chef Michael Kang, a culinary Wunderkind born in Taiwan and raised in 
Orange County, has almost as many plans cooking for his nouvelle Asian-American 
bistros as he has spices on his kitchen shelves. There's the Reagan library 
fund-raiser that the 26-year-old restaurateur is coordinating with Orange 
County Republican Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes. There's the Oscar night party 
that has locals betting the Newport Beach bash will become Orange County's 
answer to super-agent Swifty Lazar's Oscar party at Spago in Beverly Hills. And 
there are plans in the works for a fifth anniversary blowout at the Laguna 
Beach restaurant on Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
But the most significant plan, Kang thinks, is the one for a Breakfast Club -- 
a kaffeeklatsch-cum-think-tank -- he is organizing with Peter Zeughauser, 
general counsel for the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
"Peter and I have drawn up a list of about 60 people we think will be this 
county's old guard in 10 to 15 years," says Kang, who studied at the Southern 
California Institute of Architecture in Santa Monica. "It's premature to 
mention names. But 40 of them have already verbally committed to the club. 
They're younger people with something to say, people who care about local 
concerns such as the environment and transportation and hope to help make a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County is chock-full of clubs with "strings attached," Kang believes. 
"There are private clubs that are all about political status. There are private 
clubs that are all about social status. 
</P>
<P>
"But my friends and I are 'anti' that kind of thing. We want a place where all 
kinds of people -- from young artists to top execs to female rights activists 
-- can come together and discuss issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County needs an intellectual breeding ground that is free of 
pretentiousness." 
</P>
<P>
Members will pay annual dues (the amount of which is yet to be established, 
Kang says, "but the fee will be low; I don't plan to make money on this"), and 
members will be allowed in the Newport Beach restaurant between 6:30 a.m. and 
10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Kang understands that his Breakfast Club says more about his needs than Orange 
County's. "The Chinese are into 'essence of life,' " he says, "which means I 
should have control of my life, not society. 
</P>
<P>
"So I decided that if I was going to work here, I wanted to make a 
contribution, bring in something new -- be it food, art or thought -- update 
the county as I influence it." 
</P>
<P>
Kang said he calculates every move. "I'm very careful to be one step ahead. I 
am never in the mainstream. I guess that comes from being raised in a rich and 
affluent area (Kang went to Corona del Mar High School). After that, you can't 
stand to be in the mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
Proof that he's a free-thinker: ultra-nouvelle menu items such as "blackened 
sashimi." 
</P>
<P>
"That dish is a contradiction in terms," Kang says, laughing. The paper-thin, 
raw fish comes to the table black around the edges. 
</P>
<P>
Other menu favorites: goat cheese won ton and Kung Pao calamari, a squid steak 
that has been tenderized with a thousand needles, what Kang calls "squid 
acupuncture," and fried in a wok with chili, peanuts and caramelized soy sauce. 
"People love it." 
</P>
<P>
Other spots to watch in 1990: The Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach, where on 
March 28 Nancy Reagan will speak to members of Circle 1000, a support group for 
the Hoag Cancer Center. The event, with 500 expected to attend, marks the third 
"Circle 1000 Brunch." 
</P>
<P>
Former speakers have been actress Jill Ireland, author of "Life Wish," and 
Betty Rollin, who wrote "First, You Cry." 
</P>
<P>
The former First Lady, who has had a mastectomy, will speak of her own 
experience with the disease, says Joan Greatrake, Hoag's director of special 
projects. Greatrake declined to disclose the amount that the former First Lady 
will charge for her appearance. "I've been asked by my superiors not to discuss 
it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
To attend, guests must make a minimum donation of $150. Donations up to $1,000 
are encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
The new Hoag Cancer Center will officially open on June 2 with a major 
donor-recognition luncheon, followed by a gala. Both events will be held in a 
tent erected next to the center. The gala is being planned by the Sandpipers, a 
Hoag support group.

SINGLE LIFE: SERVICES PROVIDE WELCOME RELIEF TO MOVING EXPERIENCE 
</P>

<P>
Making a move from one place to another is always difficult, and as a single 
person, you may be facing it alone, often with no support system to lean upon. 
</P>
<P>
A single person sometimes relocates to a new town, new home and new job in one 
step. For the single custodial parents, there is the added pressure of helping 
children adjust to new surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
Growing comfortable with a new job, new home and new friends may simply take 
time; however, there are ways single people can hasten the process. 
</P>
<P>
The Smart Move specializes in minimizing moving trauma. "We take up where the 
moving van leaves off," says Patty Dakides, founder and president of the Laguna 
Hills-based company. 
</P>
<P>
For $25 an hour, Dakides and company will coordinate your move, unpack, line 
the shelves, wash, clean, organize and, if you wish, decorate your new home. 
</P>
<P>
A well-worn and weary transplantee can come home after a long first day at the 
office to discover a dinner complete with wine, fresh-cut flowers and a card 
that reads "Welcome to your new home" waiting on the table. 
</P>
<P>
"When everything is in order on the home front, the rest of life seems to run 
more smoothly," Dakides says. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy Collins started Irvine-based Bright Beginnings, a neighborhood welcoming 
service, five years ago when she was newly single. "My husband and I split up 
suddenly after our move here. I had lived in Ft. Worth for many years, and I 
hadn't made any friends. Starting the company was really a defense against the 
devastation of a 28-year marriage." 
</P>
<P>
Working with local chambers of commerce, city officials, real estate agents and 
referrals from private citizens, Collins and her daughter, Melanie Hodgson, 
cover an eight-city spread from Fountain Valley to Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
They phone new residents to schedule a "welcoming" appointment. Then they 
dispatch a company representative to each recipient's home, bearing free and 
"dollars-off" coupons for goods and services offered by local sponsors. "We 
also present them with a valuable packet of civic information that includes a 
letter of greeting from the mayor, maps, DMV and voter registration 
information," Collins says. 
</P>
<P>
Local retailers, such as beauty salons, fast-food chains, department stores and 
malls, offer free gifts of haircuts, pizza and dry-cleaning services. Health 
care professionals, such as dentists, doctors, optometrists and chiropractors, 
offer complimentary teeth cleaning or a free medical diagnostic evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
The welcoming packet also includes information on social, cultural and charity 
groups. "We leave each newcomer with a consumer directory of sponsors and our 
phone number, in case they have any questions or require further assistance," 
Hodgson adds. 
</P>
<P>
Bright Beginnings welcomes all newcomers, single or married. For new citizens 
who reside in South Orange County, Collins and Hodgson offer free referrals to 
other neighborhood welcoming services. 
</P>
<P>
Both mother and daughter are unmarried, and they believe that single people on 
their own have special needs when relocating to a new place. "The toughest part 
about being new in town," Hodgson says, "is taking that first step of getting 
to know your community." 
</P>
<P>
They offer these tips to help singles make a smoother and faster transition: 
</P>
<P>
Get involved mentally, physically and spiritually, according to your interests. 
Join groups that cater to your favorite pastimes and hobbies. 
</P>
<P>
Subscribe to a newspaper and regional magazine so you can learn about the area. 
They list places to visit, dine and shop, and publish information about 
scheduled events that can acquaint you with singles activities and cultural 
events. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all large apartment or condominium complexes organize regularly 
scheduled events, from aerobics classes to Sunday brunches, barbecues and ski 
trips. Many of the participants will be new to the area. Take advantage of 
these offerings. Many are low cost and some are free. 
</P>
<P>
Networking is the name of the game for any professional, especially if you're 
single. Contact the chamber of commerce in your area. You need not be a 
business owner to join your local chamber. The general public is welcome. Fees 
vary among chapters, but average annual membership runs about $75 for 
non-business owners. With a variety of motivational breakfasts, mixers, 
cocktail parties and other events offered throughout the year, you can make 
valuable business and social connections. 
</P>
<P>
It's rare to find a native Californian in Orange County. Why not start your own 
newcomer's social group? 
</P>
<P>
Ask other people who have moved to Orange County for suggestions on making a 
smooth transition. People enjoy being helpful, and they will probably extend a 
social invitation. 
</P>
<P>
Don't wait for someone else to make the first move. If you want to be part of 
your new environment, you need to show your interest in it. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to bury yourself in work when you don't have new friends or your 
social calendar is unfettered. But don't get into a routine that you can't 
change once your social life perks up. 
</P>
<P>
Make a point of an in-person meeting with the parents of your child's friends. 
Not only is this something that every parent should do, but you will widen your 
social network. 
</P>
<P>
Reach out. Let people know you need them. Talk to people at your health club, 
the dry cleaners, at church or while doing volunteer work. As a newcomer, your 
best resource is other people.

WON'T SEEK NORIEGA DEAL: BUSH; 
</P>
<P>
HE SAYS 'CASE IS STRONG,' BUT WON'T RULE OUT TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush declared today that the U.S. government "is not seeking a deal" 
with former Panama strongman Manuel A. Noriega to reduce the criminal charges 
against him in exchange for 
</P>
<P>
information about drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
During a White House news conference, his first public comment since Noriega 
was brought to the United States and arraigned Thursday on drug charges in 
Miami, Bush trod lightly in discussing the case against the deposed dictator. 
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to a fair trial and to providing all the protections 
guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and laws," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he had been informed by Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh earlier in the day 
"that our case is strong, our resolve is firm and our legal representations are 
sound." 
</P>
<P>
But while insisting there was no plan to pursue a plea-bargain arrangement, the 
President suggested the government might listen if the idea is raised by 
Noriega, saying, "The man's entitled to do whatever is granted him under our 
laws." 
</P>
<P>
"He's got his rights," Bush said, "and we ought not to stand up here and try to 
define narrowly what they are." 
</P>
<P>
That noncommittal line was echoed at the Justice Department, where spokesman 
David Runkel told reporters that "as in any case, if the defendant has 
something to say, we have an obligation to listen, to hear that person out." 
</P>
<P>
In bringing Noriega to the United States to stand trial after his surrender 
Wednesday night to U.S. authorities in Panama City, the Administration left 
open the question of any reduction of or addition to the charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
Bush served notice that he will not comment in the weeks and months ahead "on 
any aspect of this prosecution or any matters that could even inadvertently 
affect the outcome." 
</P>
<P>
"Our government is not seeking a deal with Noriega," Bush said. "Our policy 
remains that we have brought him to this country for prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
The President said the thousands of American troops who were deployed to Panama 
on Dec. 20 to oust Noriega and install a democratic government would return 
home "as soon as possible. . . . I would look for an early return." 
</P>
<P>
As for a timetable, he said, "Can't help you." He said he had no current plans 
to visit Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said about 24,500 troops were still there, about 900 fewer than 
the previous day, and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, was in Panama today to develop a timetable for withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
Shifting from the military aspects of the invasion to its political and 
economic consequences, Bush said he is sending Vice President Dan Quayle on a 
fence-mending mission to Latin America, where the U.S. action was denounced.

EMOTIONAL BUSH PROTESTS TV'S SPLIT IMAGES;

PANAMA: HE IS UPSET OVER NETWORKS JUXTAPOSING SOLDIERS' COFFINS WITH HIS

His voice choking with emotion, President Bush today protested the use of a 
split screen by two television networks and CNN showing the caskets of soldiers 
killed in Panama returning to the United States while he was making "frivolous 
comments" during a news conference last month. 
</P>
<P>
Bush told reporters that it appeared that he "didn't give a damn and I do." 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional appeal, he urged the networks to notify him if such a technique 
is going to be used. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the juxtaposition of the two 
events on the screen simultaneously -- the flag-draped coffins arriving at 
Dover, Del., and the news conference in the White House press room -- by ABC, 
CBS and CNN "absolutely was deliberate." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said Bush is "very upset about it" and "it's hard to believe the 
networks did not understand the significance of it." 
</P>
<P>
Bush told reporters that he had received a lot of mail "and I had some calls" 
after his news conference on Dec. 21 "because when I was speaking here in this 
room the networks juxtaposed against my frivolous comments at the time the 
split screen . . . it showed American lives. The bodies of dead soldiers in 
caskets . . . coming home." 
</P>
<P>
"And I would respectfully request if the urgency of the moment is such, if that 
technique is going to be used," he said, "if I could be told about it and will 
stop the proceedings or if it's something less traumatic. I could understand 
why the viewers were concerned about this. 
</P>
<P>
"They thought their President, at a solemn moment like that, didn't give a 
damn, and I do, I do," he said. "I feel it so strongly. So please help me with 
that, if you would."

A 15-year-old student accused of shooting a boy in the face and holding a drama 
class hostage at Loara High School in Anaheim will go to trial on attempted 
murder charges Feb. 6 in Orange County Juvenile Court, a judge ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
Juvenile Judge C. Robert Jameson set the trial date for Cordell L. (Cory) Robb 
during a brief pretrial hearing in Juvenile Court in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Robb, dressed in a jean jacket, dark blue T-shirt and jeans, was in court and 
solemnly responded to questions the judge asked. Chris Strobel, standing in for 
Robb's court-appointed attorney, Gary Proctor, asked Jameson for a third 
court-appointed psychiatrist to help in Robb's defense, and the judge agreed to 
the request. 
</P>
<P>
Robb has been in detention at Orange County Juvenile Hall since his arrest Oct. 
5, the day the youth is accused of holding classmates at Loara High hostage 
with a handgun and shotgun and shooting Anthony Lopez, 15, in the left side of 
the face.

POLICE STEP UP WAR ON GANGS IN O.C.

Police stepped up the war against gangs today, announcing the arrests of a 
reputed Santa Ana gang member who allegedly harassed a witness to one of Orange 
County's worst gang murders and of an Oceanside man in connection with a 
drive-by shooting in San Clemente on Christmas Eve that wounded a 4-year-old 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana suspect was one of three being sought by police. He allegedly was 
identified as one of the members of the notorious 5th Street gang in Santa Ana 
who threatened a witness with death. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign of terror included a Molotov cocktail thrown at the witness' 
house, shots fired along his street and claims that a $3,000 contract had been 
put out on his life, said Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Avdeef. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police conducted six searches at Santa Ana houses looking for 
evidence in the case. They arrested Richard Ramirez, 20, of Santa Ana on 
Thursday and booked him on charges of conspiracy, assault with a deadly weapon 
and intimidating a witness. 
</P>
<P>
The witness, who was not identified, is expected to testify against three 
reputed members of the 5th Street gang who sprayed gunfire from the bed of a 
pickup that drove through a Garden Grove housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
Two boys, ages 4 and 17, were killed in the incident last September and several 
other people wounded in a case considered one of the worst ever for gang 
warfare in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"If you intimidate witnesses, it makes a joke of the whole criminal justice 
system," said Avdeef of the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Clemente case, officers arrested Floyd Avery, 18, of Oceanside 
Thursday for allegedly firing shots into a house as he drove by, wounding a 
4-year-old girl. Chief Albert C. Ehlow said in a statement that the Sheriff's 
Department and the district attorney's gang detail prosecutors participated in 
the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The motive for the shooting has not been disclosed.

A criminal defense lawyer was arrested at the Los Angeles Men's County Jail for 
giving his client cigarettes stuffed with marijuana, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Paul E. Potter, 42, of South Pasadena was released on $15,000 bail after his 
arrest Thursday afternoon in a room at the downtown jail set aside for lawyers 
to meet with clients. 
</P>
<P>
An arraignment date was set for Jan. 26. 
</P>
<P>
After a deputy denied Potter permission to give his client a pack of 
cigarettes, the lawyer tried to slip the inmate a pack of brand-name cigarettes 
that had been repacked with marijuana and plugged at the tip with tobacco, a 
spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Potter's client, Steve Young, 30, had been charged in connection with five 
robberies and is being held on $1-million bail. He faces additional charges of 
possession of drugs in a jail facility.

POLICE INVESTIGATING POSSIBLE BOMB LINK TO PORTER RANCH

<P>
Los Angeles police are investigating whether two bombs found recently in the 
North San Fernando Valley are related to the $2-billion Porter Ranch 
development proposal, detectives said today. 
</P>
<P>
Bomb squad detectives early today took about four hours to disarm the most 
recent device, which was found late Thursday on a construction site along 
Sesnon Boulevard in Northridge, Detective Robert Muldrew said. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 20, a bomb explosion blew out the windows of a truck parked on Sesnon 
Boulevard near Louise Avenue in Granada Hills. No one was hurt in either 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Neither bomb was on the site of the 1,300-acre residential and commercial 
Porter Ranch proposal being considered by the Los Angeles City Council. 
However, the locations of the bombs correspond with each end of a related 
proposal for a bridge across nearby Aliso Canyon. Porter Ranch developer Nathan 
Shapell has agreed to help finance the construction of the Sesnon Boulevard 
bridge, which some residents oppose for the traffic it would bring to their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The two bombs "could be just merely vandalism-type incidents," Muldrew said. He 
added: "It ultimately could be related to the development, but right now we 
don't have anything that would indicate that."

<P>
A panic-stricken Elena Ceausescu turned to her ousted dictator husband as they 
were put before a firing squad and said: "Nicolae, they are going to shoot us," 
and then tried to break loose, according to an army captain who saw the 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
The officer, identified only as Gheorghe, said Ceausescu's wife struggled to 
get free when she realized she was about to die. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband were put against a wall and shot. 
</P>
<P>
The army and civilian authorities who overthrew Ceausescu's repressive 24-year 
rule in last month's bloody revolution have given conflicting details of the 
couple's last hours before their execution Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
A deputy police commander told Romanian television they were kept at a barracks 
near Buftea, north of Bucharest, after being taken there by two policemen 
following an abortive attempt to flee. 
</P>
<P>
Militia and army officials at Tirgoviste said the couple was tried and executed 
at the local military barracks, near the railway station. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking the strict taboo against conversations with foreigners which Ceausescu 
imposed, soldiers, policemen, taxi drivers and waitresses eagerly discussed the 
hunting down and capture of their former leader with two journalists visiting 
Tirgoviste, a town of 60,000 inhabitants northwest of Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers and militia said the Ceausescus were tried and shot without delay 
because the barracks was attacked by helicopters manned by Securitate forces 
determined to free them. 
</P>
<P>
"The helicopters attacked the barracks, shooting machine-gun fire," a local 
militia chief said, adding that several people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Local residents said Ceausescu, lifted by helicopter from the roof of the 
Communist Party headquarters in Bucharest Dec. 22 as a crowd turned against 
him, landed in Buftea and headed for a secret airport 30 miles from Tirgoviste. 
</P>
<P>
According to these accounts, he and his wife were spotted being driven by their 
chauffeur to a metallurgy complex whose manager was a friend, and Ceausescu 
shot dead a factory guard who recognized him. 
</P>
<P>
The couple fled as a crowd gathered and in the ensuing chase were forced to 
change cars after running out of gas. 
</P>
<P>
They were finally surrounded at an agriculture center. Two militiamen anxious 
to avoid a lynching took them away in a van loaded with radar equipment and 
handed them over to the army.

A former chemist for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was sentenced today 
to 30 days in prison for taking $4,300 in bribes to influence the government's 
approval of generic drugs made by two companies. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge John Hargrove sentenced David Brancato to three two-year 
prison terms, but suspended all but 30 days.

Brancato also was fined $3,000, ordered to serve 500 hours of community service

He was accused of accepting bribes from Ashok Patel, former senior vice 
president of Par Pharmaceuticals of Spring Valley, N.Y., and Dilip Shah, former 
president of Quad Pharmaceuticals of Indianapolis. Patel and Shah were 
convicted earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Brancato, who worked in the FDA's Rockville, Md., office, took 
the money in exchange for favorable FDA treatment of applications for approval 
of generic drugs produced by the companies.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has been renominated for the 1990 Nobel 
Peace Prize, a source at the Nobel Institute said today. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev has been proposed," said the source at the Norwegian Nobel 
Institute, which traditionally declines to confirm or deny the names of the 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader was nominated in 1988 and 1989, but the prize went to the 
U.N. peacekeeping forces and Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Both times Gorbachev shared the nomination with former President Ronald Reagan 
for their signing of an intermediate-range nuclear forces agreement. The source 
said the institute had received no nomination for Reagan.

PAROLEE IN GIRL'S '87 DEATH HELD IN 8 SERIAL MURDERS

<P>
A man paroled in 1987 in the killing of an 8-year-old girl was arraigned today 
on charges of murdering eight women in the Rochester area since March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur J. Shawcross, 44, a food service worker, pleaded innocent to eight 
murder counts before Rochester City Judge John Manning Regan and was sent to 
the Monroe County Jail without bail. 
</P>
<P>
State Police Superintendent Thomas Constantine said in Albany that charges will 
be brought against Shawcross in at least three more Rochester murders and that 
he is a suspect in other deaths. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of at least 14 slain women have been found in the area in the last 
22 months. Deputy Rochester Police Chief Terrence Rickard said there may have 
been as many as 17 serial slaying victims and that Shawcross may have told 
authorities where to find three bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the women, including June Cicero, 34, of Rochester, whose body was 
found frozen in a creek on Wednesday in Ogden, were involved in prostitution or 
drugs, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Rochester Police Chief Gordon Urlacher said today that police believe Shawcross 
was responsible for at least 11 of the murders. 
</P>
<P>
Shawcross was arrested Wednesday after officers in a police helicopter saw a 
car speeding away from the creek where Cicero's body was found. 
</P>
<P>
"The person derives some type of satisfaction from the murder and it's very 
possible that they go back and look at the results," Constantine said. 
</P>
<P>
The Syracuse Post-Standard quoted sources as saying the suspect told police 
several women were killed for mocking him when he was unable to engage in sex; 
another was killed when she broke the gearshift knob on his girlfriend's car; 
another because he thought she lied about being a virgin, and yet another 
because she pushed him into the Genesee River on a swimming outing. 
</P>
<P>
Shawcross served 15 years of a 25-year sentence after a 1972 first-degree 
manslaughter conviction for the murder of Karen Ann Hill, 8, who was strangled 
and sexually molested. 
</P>
<P>
He was paroled from Green Haven state prison in June, 1987, and appeared to be 
adapting well to life outside prison, Edward Elwin, executive director of the 
state Division of Parole, said today. 
</P>
<P>
"Superficially, he was making a good adjustment," Elwin said.

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev canceled meetings with foreign guests to 
concentrate on domestic crises, and news of the schedule change triggered a 
steep drop today in the Tokyo stock market and unsettled Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev put off engagements with foreign visitors, including British 
opposition leader Neil Kinnock, to deal with border riots in Azerbaijan and the 
breakaway Communist Party of Lithuania, a senior official said today. 
</P>
<P>
News of the schedule change was not reported by Soviet media, but it was felt 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Stock Exchange recorded its sharpest drop today since Oct. 16, 
plummeting 438.12 points, and analysts linked the plunge to concern about 
Gorbachev's fate. A slight decline in stock prices on Wall Street and a steep 
drop on the Hong Kong exchange also were attributed to the Soviet leader's 
schedule changes. 
</P>
<P>
"To Japan, the worst thing that could happen to the world scenario would be for 
Gorbachev to drop from sight," Chris Schreiber, an investment analyst with New 
Japan Securities, said in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
The market reactions pointed up how closely Gorbachev is linked by many in the 
capitalist world to the success of the reforms and improved East-West relations 
he has pursued since coming to power in March, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Communist Party official, asked today about Western news reports that 
Gorbachev had postponed planned meetings with Kinnock and other foreign 
dignitaries, replied, "It's right." 
</P>
<P>
"We have many problems right now," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist official, speaking on condition of anonymity, mentioned 
disturbances this week along the Iranian border and the Lithuanian Communist 
Party's decision to break away from the ruling national party headed by 
Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev is expected to travel to Lithuania next week on a mission from the 
national party's Central Committee to try to mend the rift with the Lithuanian 
Communists. They voted two weeks ago to split off from the 20-million-member 
ruling party and pursue local independence, and Lithuanian party leaders who 
met with Gorbachev for five hours Thursday said he failed to sway them from 
their decision. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Estonian Communist Party threw its support to the Lithuanians in 
the dispute with Moscow, reports said today. The Estonian party's Central 
Committee meeting Thursday set March 23 for a session of its own full congress. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov would neither confirm nor deny 
that Gorbachev was putting aside foreign questions to concentrate on domestic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about a report from London that the Soviet ambassador to Britain, Leonid 
Zamyatin, had told Kinnock that Gorbachev was postponing a Jan. 16 meeting with 
Kinnock and all other contacts with foreign politicians this month, Gerasimov 
replied: "Has this meeting been planned? Let the Associated Press compose its 
own commentary. For me this is all clear. Let them comment on that as they 
wish." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's calendar is rarely made public, and whenever he disappears from the 
public eye, speculation about his activities and even his health becomes rife. 
He scoffed at such rumor-mongering this summer at the first session of the 
Congress of People's Deputies.

Trade figures released today showed car sales in Japan rose 12% in 1989, and 
strong demand is likely to drive vehicle sales to their fourth consecutive 
record high in 1990, industry sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Sales rose to 5.56 million units last year, nearly 12% higher than 1988, 
figures released by the Japan Automobile Dealers Assn. said. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese market is strong not only as a result of demand for replacement 
vehicles but also among first-time buyers. Japanese have been buying more cars 
thanks to rising disposable income and low interest rates on car loans, 
especially among dealers of foreign cars. 
</P>
<P>
Some people scrapped plans to buy houses or condominiums because of their high 
prices and purchased cars instead, the sources said.

More than 1,000 foreign firms have created formal joint ventures with Soviet 
partners, but many of the enterprises have failed to start up and some have 
gone bankrupt, the Tass press agency said today. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said the Finance Ministry has registered 1,284 joint ventures, with a 
total charter capital of more than $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the Western investment in joint ventures went into light industry and 
service establishments, it said. Another 20% was invested in industrial 
services such as marketing, engineering and maintenance, and about 15% was 
committed to heavy industry and machine tools. 
</P>
<P>
But Tass said the ventures were frequently plagued by legal, financial and 
organizational problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The number of joint enterprises that have not begun operations is very high. 
There are cases when they go bankrupt or dissolve," Tass said.

KEATING DENIES CHARGE OF LINCOLN SHAM DEALS

<P>
Charles H. Keating Jr. today denied allegations that Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan 
was involved in sham transactions and said federal regulators did not 
understand the complex land syndications in which the thrift participated. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's testimony came during the sixth day of a hearing on government 
motions to dismiss a lawsuit Keating filed in May seeking to regain control of 
the Irvine, Calif., thrift, which was seized by regulators last April. 
</P>
<P>
The rescue of the thrift is expected to cost taxpayers as much as $2.5 billion, 
making it the nation's most costly thrift bailout. 
</P>
<P>
The government said Lincoln was not being operated in compliance with federal 
regulations and found the thrift unsafe and unsound, even though Keating said 
he hired accountants and lawyers to make sure the activities of his American 
Continental Corp. and Lincoln were in compliance with federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Keating discounted many findings thrift examiners made in a report that led the 
Federal Home Loan Bank Board to order Lincoln placed into conservatorship. The 
executive told the court Lincoln was harassed by federal regulators and 
subjected to the longest examination in history. 
</P>
<P>
"Their requests were horrendous and not in keeping with a normal audit," 
Keating said. "The sledding became very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Thrift regulators hounded Lincoln, Keating said, because of his opposition to a 
1985 rule limiting the direct investments that could be made by thrifts. "I ran 
into headlong opposition and antagonism from regulators," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The executive also denied government contentions that a tax-sharing agreement 
between Lincoln and the now-bankrupt American Continental was designed to 
siphon more than $94 million from the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
"With all my heart and soul I categorically deny that. I had no concept 
remotely related to that," Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
The government has based its case largely on four transactions including the 
tax plan, an $11.3-million profit on a stock sale and two real estate deals 
involving property in the Arizona desert that thrift examiners contend were set 
up solely to dissipate assets from Lincoln to American Continental.

<P>
Factory orders rebounded in November from two months of consecutive declines, 
rising 2.4% to the second highest level of 1989 in a sign of strength for the 
economy, the Commerce Department reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The November increase followed a revised 0.1% October drop and a 1% September 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
Originally the department said October factory orders fell 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile defense category, factory orders rose 1.8% in November 
after rising 0.3% in October. 
</P>
<P>
The hike resulted from an increase in orders for durable goods, items ranging 
from trucks to oil tankers that are meant to last three years or more. Durable 
goods orders rose 4.8% in November after falling 0.8% in October. 
</P>
<P>
Orders for new aircraft accounted for about 60% of the gain in transportation 
orders, and autos added about $1.5 billion, the department said. Excluding the 
transportation category, orders rose 1.1% in November.

'ANNIE 2' RATES RAVES, LIKE IN RAVING 'WITLESS'

<P>
"Annie" was a musical to take to your heart, but you'll want to take a paddle 
to "Annie 2: Miss Hannigan's Revenge," the sequel that opened Thursday night in 
the Kennedy Center Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the same creative talents are back on the job, looking to repeat the 
miracle that made "Annie" the sleeper of 1977. 
</P>
<P>
But you'd never guess it if your program didn't say so. What was so disarming 
the first time around has become witless and belabored. The plot cooked up by 
Thomas Meehan is preposterous. The score by Charles Strouse and Martin Charnin 
is dull. 
</P>
<P>
And this decade's Annie, Danielle Findley, while possessed of a voice that can 
no doubt be heard in West Virginia, seems to have acquired a bratty side now 
that she's living in the lap of luxury. 
</P>
<P>
About all that serves to connect the two shows are the sets by David Mitchell, 
who can make New York City in the Depression one swell-looking place. The 
highlight of "Annie 2," in fact, occurs when a vast ocean liner sails past a 
dilapidated tugboat attached to a pier on the East River. The tugboat tosses 
wildly in the wake, while the liner, a dark colossus, blasts its horns and 
glides efficiently out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
Watching "Annie 2" is like being invited to a fabulous party and then 
discovering that there's no one interesting to talk to. You wind up staring at 
the pictures on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
The musical continues its pre-Broadway tryout through Jan. 20.

POLICE SHOWS TAKE CHARGE ON TV THIS WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you believe in the old saw, "There's never a cop around when you need one," 
then tune in this weekend. Cops -- and cop shows -- abound, the most 
unconventional of which is CBS' "Max Monroe: Loose Cannon," premiering tonight 
and starring former Los Angeles deejay Shadoe Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens has an unusual background. His real first name is Terry, which was 
disclosed in a CBS biographical sketch that says the Jamestown, N.D., native 
had his own show on a local radio station, "Spin With Terry," when he was just 
11. At 10, he had built his own radio station, drawing the interest of 
officials at station KEYJ. 
</P>
<P>
Hitting the radio big time as a disc jockey in Los Angeles in the early 1970s, 
at KROQ-FM and then KMET-FM, Stevens subsequently became the voice of the 
national broadcast "American Top 40" and moved into television, most recently 
as announcer (and sometimes square occupant) of "Hollywood Squares." 
</P>
<P>
He also has been a successful producer of commercials through his company, 
Shadoevision. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday and Sunday, the irreverent young cop genre gives way to the stylish 
"old cop" genre. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday comes Telly Savalas as "Kojak" in the latest of the rotating "ABC 
Mystery Movie" dramas. He is investigating the killing of a police officer 
suspected of being on the take. 
</P>
<P>
On CBS Sunday, Richard Crenna returns for a third TV-movie turn as New York 
police Detective Frank Janek in "Murder in Black and White." He is 
investigating the murder of a police commissioner. Diahann Carroll co-stars as 
the victim's widow. 
</P>
<P>
Crenna first created the compelling character in 1985 in "Doubletake" and 
continued the role in "Internal Affairs" last season.

A $3-million gift from a Los Angeles art collector and philanthropist appears 
to mean the University of Minnesota art museum will finally get a home of its 
own, designed by one of America's most prominent architects. 
</P>
<P>
The new building has been made possible by a gift from Frederick Weisman, whose 
$3-million gift qualifies for a matching grant from the University of Minnesota 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The museum will be designed by Santa Monica architect Frank Gehry. Gehry has an 
international reputation for designing buildings that are themselves considered 
works of art. 
</P>
<P>
The $6 million generated by Weisman's gift, plus $1 million previously raised 
and matched by the foundation, means that the museum needs only the approval of 
the university Board of Regents. Weisman is expected to attend the Jan. 12 
meeting of the board, where they will discuss the new $8-million structure. 
</P>
<P>
Weisman, who was born and raised in Minneapolis, will decide whether the museum 
will bear his name or that of his parents, William and Mary Weisman.

LIZ SMITH: REVIVED MOVIE CAREER GETS TRAVOLTA DANCING

JOHN TRAVOLTA delighted the Rainbow Room patrons on New Year's Eve when he took 
to the dance floor. He made people feel just like it was -- well, New Year's 
Eve! 
</P>
<P>
Although the glamorous room atop New York's Rockefeller Center doesn't really 
encourage disco dancing, Travolta moved around the floor much as he did years 
ago in "Saturday Night Fever." He is a big star again, thanks to "Look Who's 
Talking," which has taken in $150 million so far at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
Travolta couldn't get himself arrested about a year ago, but now he is juggling 
six movie offers. No wonder he's dancing! 
</P>
<P>
NEXT TUESDAY at 10 a.m. the National Museum of American History in the 
Smithsonian will officially install the Barbara Bush inaugural gown designed by 
Arnold Scaasi. And the sapphire "Barbara Bush Blue" velvet-draped top with its 
skirt of sapphire blue satin becomes a part of permanent official history. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush will give a private luncheon after in the White House for designer 
Scaasi, as well as for the queen of all purse makers, Judith Leiber, and 
Kenneth Jay Lane, the man who designs the Barbara Bush pearls. 
</P>
<P>
Scaasi, whose new perfume is said to be the rage of Los Angeles, will stay 
overnight in the private Bush quarters at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. 
</P>
<P>
This has caused his pals, who call Arnold "He Who Must Be Obeyed," to quip that 
it will be the first time a Napoleon has ever slept in the Lincoln bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
JOSEPH HELLER, the maestro of "Catch-22" and many another walloping American 
yarn, has been offered a Christianson Fellowship at Oxford next winter and has 
decided to accept. He will give at least one lecture on American literature and 
then spend the rest of his time "socializing and learning," as he puts it. "I 
am really looking forward to this." Heller was in Oxford back in 1949 on a 
Fulbright Scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
The author is busy on a new novel, which takes place when his "Catch-22" 
protagonist, the former Air Corps Capt. Yossarian of World War II, will be a 
fictional 68 years old. 
</P>
<P>
It projects a time when President Bush will have resigned in favor of Dan 
Quayle. There is no title yet for this work, but both Esquire and Smart are 
said to be preparing excerpts. 
</P>
<P>
DAWN STEEL, the head of Columbia Pictures pre-Guber &amp; Peters &amp; Sony, is 
in a wheelchair from a broken leg suffered while skiing in Colorado over 
Christmas. They do say Dawn will soon be wheeling herself right out the front 
-- not the back -- door of Columbia, and it will happen as soon as negotiations 
for her departure are completed. 
</P>
<P>
I told you she didn't resign; she'll go quietly when the time and the price are 
right. They do say this lady has tales to tell -- which she probably won't -- 
about the machinations of Columbia's takeover by Sony of Japan.

Mayor Tom Bradley has scheduled a meeting Monday with local business leaders to 
talk about Los Angeles being in jeopardy of not having a National Football 
League team in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders moved from Oakland to Los Angeles in 1982, but the team's future 
home is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it's the Raiders or some other professional team, this city, the 
second-largest city in the country, must have a professional football team," 
Bradley said today. 
</P>
<P>
"I have called a group of community leaders together for the purpose of 
supporting a professional football team in Los Angeles and to help us in 
generating the same kind of community spirit we were able to generate when a 
similar kind of committee was appointed that brought the Raiders to Los Angeles 
in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley wouldn't say whether the group's top priority was to keep the Raiders 
playing at the Los Angeles Coliseum, their home for eight seasons, or whether 
he supported the Coliseum Commission's most recent tentative offer to Al Davis, 
the Raiders managing general partner. Coliseum Commission President Richard 
Riordon has said the offer includes a tax-free $20-million payment to the team 
and a promise to raise $145 million from private sources to refurbish the 
Coliseum, which was built in 1923.

Raymond Berry is apparently staying on as coach of the New England Patriots in 
the 1990 National Football League season, fulfilling the final year of his 
three-year contract and keeping continuity for the team, a Patriots spokesman 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
"That sounds right, but we haven't announced anything," said team spokesman Jim 
Greenidge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not official." 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Patrick Sullivan told the Boston Globe in a story published 
today that Berry will be free to decide the makeup of his staff and make 
whatever changes he wishes. 
</P>
<P>
"Changing coaches is not the panacea that everyone thinks it is," Sullivan said 
Thursday after meeting with Berry and several others in the organization's 
front office. 
</P>
<P>
"The process itself sets the organization back at least a year. I don't want to 
set this organization back," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
Berry said he was pleased he'll be back next season, and said he wouldn't be 
adverse to changes. The Patriots had a 5-11 record last season, although they 
were deluged with injuries.

CBS plans to have an emergency generator at Candlestick Park in San Francisco 
for Saturday's game between the 49ers and the Minnesota Vikings just in case 
there is another earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
A deadly 7.1 earthquake rocked the San Francisco Bay Area on Oct. 17, 31 
minutes before the scheduled start of Game 3 of the World Series in 
Candlestick. ABC, which was broadcasting the baseball game, was knocked off the 
air and needed to borrow a generator from ESPN.

<P>
Aaron Broten, the top scorer in the New Jersey Devils' history, was traded 
today to the Minnesota North Stars for center Bob Brooke. 
</P>
<P>
The deal unites Broten with his older brother, Neal, for the first time since 
1980-81 when they were with the University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Broten, in his nine-year NHL career, all with the Devils, has scored 469 
points on 162 goals and 307 assists in 641 games. This season in 42 games, he 
has 18 points, including 10 goals and eight assists, playing primarily on a 
checking line. 
</P>
<P>
Brooke is a six-year NHL veteran acquired by the North Stars in November, 1986, 
in a trade with the New York Rangers, along with a fourth-round draft pick in 
1988 for Curt Giles, Tony McKegney and a second-round 1988 draft pick.

VIETNAM FREES 300 PRISONERS; 60 DUE IN O.C.

<TEXT>
<P>
While American relatives anxiously awaited word, 300 former Vietnamese 
political prisoners arrived here Friday on the first leg of a journey that will 
bring more than half of them to California, including more than 60 to Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The emigres, among them former South Vietnamese military officers and 
government officials who spent years in "re-education" camps, are the first 
political detainees to leave with their families under an accord reached 
between Washington and Hanoi last July after seven years of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all very happy. It's been long overdue and we've been waiting a long 
time to get this chance to travel to the United States," said Nguyen Van So, a 
former captain in the South Vietnamese Army. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen, who is traveling with his wife and two teen-age children, has a 
brother-in-law in Arleta. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't forget those of us who are still behind in Vietnam," said Nguyen, who 
received a master's degree from UCLA in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
After the Communist victory in Vietnam in 1975, he was sent to a re-education 
camp for six years. Tens of thousands of former South Vietnamese military 
personnel and civil servants were sent to such camps for manual labor and 
political indoctrination by the Communist government because of their close 
association with the old regime in Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Orange and Los Angeles counties, friends and relatives anxiously 
looked forward to long-awaited reunions. 
</P>
<P>
"The day is finally here when I will see my brother again after more than 14 
years," said Kim-Nhung Tran, 47, who runs a dressmaking shop in Westminster. 
Her brother spent eight years in prison camps in northern Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Quang-Hoi Tran, 43, a former army colonel, his wife and his two children were 
expected to be aboard the first Air Vietnam flight, his sister said. 
</P>
<P>
She said her husband, son and a second brother drowned in a botched escape from 
Vietnam in 1980. Undaunted, she fled by boat five months later, landed in a 
Thai refugee camp and later settled in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But a third brother, who also spent seven years in prison camp, is still in Ho 
Chi Minh City hoping to be one of the next to depart, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Lien Dao, 65, who works for the Los Angeles County Department of Social 
Services, said her youngest brother, Hung Anh Dao, 48, once an army major, his 
wife and three children are expected to arrive at Los Angeles International 
Airport soon. 
</P>
<P>
He was captured one week after the fall of Saigon and imprisoned in that city, 
renamed Ho Chi Minh City, until 1980, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"During the first two years in prison, they beat him all the time," said Dao, 
who communicated with her brother by mail over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"After three years in prison, his wife was allowed to visit him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
After his release in 1980, Dao said, "he could not have a job and he dared not 
go outside because people watched him. His wife supported the family with a 
black market business selling everything, like medication and clothes," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dao, who has been trying to get her brother out of Vietnam for 10 years, said 
her mother "dreamed of coming to the United States with her son. Unfortunately, 
she died in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"He finished four years of college in French and is very good in mathematics," 
she said. "Maybe he can learn a job in computers." 
</P>
<P>
The former detainees arrived in Bangkok aboard chartered Air Vietnam jets 
accompanied by members of their immediate families. They will spend about a 
week in the Thai capital undergoing medical testing and administrative 
processing before being put aboard commercial flights to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said it is unknown how many might qualify under the program, but 
the figure could be as high as 100,000. One official said he expected the 
number of former re-education camp prisoners leaving Vietnam to reach about 
1,000 a month in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Refugee resettlement officials in Southern California confirmed that at least 
70 people in Friday's group were headed for Los Angeles County and at least 63 
are planning to join relatives who have settled in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Ho Van Phuoc, a former South Vietnamese air force lieutenant who was on a 
Friday flight from Ho Chi Minh City, is joining a sister, Mai Ho Nguyen, in 
Whittier. He said the situation in Vietnam was "still very bad. There is no 
work." 
</P>
<P>
Ho spent seven years in a re-education camp and then said he struggled to 
survive as a tailor in Ho Chi Minh City. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a better opportunity in America," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, the United States and Vietnam reached agreement to allow former 
political prisoners who served "substantial" periods in re-education camps to 
leave for resettlement in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, small numbers of former re-education camp inmates have been 
allowed to leave Vietnam, but for reasons other than their status as political 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
The July agreement, negotiated by Robert L. Funseth, a senior deputy assistant 
secretary of state, provided for the resettlement of the former political 
prisoners and their close family members. 
</P>
<P>
The resettlement comes in addition to the estimated 3,000 Vietnamese who leave 
for the United States each month under the Orderly Departure Program, which is 
designed to facilitate the resettlement of persons who were connected with the 
South Vietnamese government and their families. 
</P>
<P>
Resettlement officials have said new arrivals tend to be highly educated and 
skilled, and will be better able to make their way in America than the average 
refugee. 
</P>
<P>
But they have expressed concern that federal money for refugee services, 
already in short supply because of the influx of "boat people," will not be 
sufficient to deal with emotional and medical scars of the former prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Some in the Vietnamese emigre community in the United States worried that if 
the former prisoners are too outspoken about their experiences in Vietnam's 
prisons, they may jeopardize the release of those still hoping to get out. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has made sporadic attempts at liberalization. In December, however, 
police arrested about 10,000 people in what the government said was an 
anti-crime campaign, but which dissidents branded a political crackdown, said 
Nguyen Manh Hung, director of the Indochina Institute at George Mason 
University in Fairfax, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Thu D. Duong, a former colonel and political detainee who joined his family in 
San Clemente a month ago, said that 522 former military officers who had been 
released from re-education camps were among those rearrested in the crackdown. 
But U.S. officials could not confirm that report Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Duong expressed fears that any further political instability -- internal or 
external -- could jeopardize future releases in spite of the July accord. 
</P>
<P>
"We have waited for so long, and our situation is becoming more dangerous," 
said Duong, 59, who spent five years in the camps and was rearrested three 
times for trying to flee. "Because of the positions we held in the former 
regime, we are the first ones to be persecuted if there are any changes in the 
present political system." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace reported from Bangkok and Efron from Orange County. Times staff writers 
Louis Sahagun in Los Angeles and Thuan Le in Orange County also contributed to 
this report.

Some comments made by Gen. Manuel Noriega about his and Panama's relationship 
to the United States: 
</P>
<P>
"The humble, the poor and the blacks, they are the utmost authority of the 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Noriega speaking of his humble origins while characterizing his opponents, 
the "rabi-blancos" or "white butts," as rich and white. 
</P>
<P>
"A man is not the problem. The problem is Panama's canal and the presence of a 
foreign army in our territory." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Noriega, in March 1988, claiming the United States was behind his nation's 
unrest and rejecting calls to step down. 
</P>
<P>
"There cannot be conversation if the (U.S.) aggression continues, aggression at 
whatever level, whatever magnitude, whether it is psychological or economic 
aggression." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Noriega, on May 21, 1988, saying he wants recognition of his hand-picked 
provisional president and a reduction of U.S. forces in Panama before he agrees 
to end his standoff with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Pardon the ignorance but we cannot understand how these rich candidates in the 
United States don't use the flag to solve the problems of the blacks in New 
York, of the poorer classes, of the minorities, of those who have no heat, of 
the foreigners. ... Those are pretty themes for democracies." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Noriega, in May 1988, complaining about his role as campaign fodder for 
American presidential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"A commander doesn't abandon his ship in stormy weather." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Noriega responding to questions about whether he would step down in the 
face of pressure from the United States, May 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The gringo piranhas want to do away with me." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Noriega, blaming the United States for the failed coup attempt in October 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I was unarmed during this time. ... I'm a man of peace. I fire on my enemies, 
not against my brothers." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Noriega, after unsuccessful coup attempt in October 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in trench warfare now and we will maintain the resistance. ... We ask 
the world for help, with men, dignity and strength. ... Our slogan is to win or 
die, not one step back, and onward in the step of conquerers." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Noriega in radio broadcast after American troops arrived Dec. 20.

TRASH RECYCLING: IT'S THE LAW NOW IN L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
HE STARTED IT ALL IN HIS BEAT-UP VW VAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If every great odyssey starts with a modest first step, then the city of Los 
Angeles' quest to recycle its trash can be traced back to a ride around the 
block that self-styled hippie Gary Petersen took in his beat-up VW van. 
</P>
<P>
The year was 1972 -- July 7, 1972, to be precise -- when Petersen revved up the 
van and went door-to-door in his hometown of Santa Monica in an effort to 
obtain peoples' trash and sell it for profit. 
</P>
<P>
The 18 years since then have seen Petersen, 42, go from being one of the first 
recyclers in Southern California to one of the most successful for-profit 
recyclers and environmental consultants in the United States, if not the world. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Petersen is a clean-cut, bespectacled -- and wealthy -- businessman. His 
recycling company, Ecolo-haul, was acquired two years ago by Waste Management 
Inc., the nation's largest trash handler, for about $2 million. He tools around 
in a white Porsche 911 convertible. He lives with his wife and two children in 
Pacific Palisades when he is not traveling the world preaching the gospel of 
recycling. 
</P>
<P>
It is impossible, environmentalists and city officials say, to imagine the 
ambitious recycling plan proposed for Los Angeles without crediting Petersen, 
and the work he has done to prod Southern Californians into thinking of 
recycling as an alternative to merely dumping their trash. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been so influential because he has helped orient the thinking of the 
people in the city to look at this as all being possible," said John Stodder, 
an environmental aide to Mayor Tom Bradley, who signed the new citywide 
recycling plan into law Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"If it weren't for the pilot plans Gary designed and worked for on the 
Westside," Stodder continued, "we would never have done the citywide plan, I 
can guarantee you that." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Petersen has gotten wealthy along the way has, if anything, only 
helped to embellish his near saint-like status among those involved in the 
complicated and bothersome task of teaching the public to recycle. 
</P>
<P>
"He deserves it," said Dennis Nishikawa, vice president of the city Board of 
Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
"He put in his blood, sweat and tears when no one else was around. He 
introduced me and everyone else to what recycling was all about," said 
Nishikawa, who oversees the city's effort to engineer the nation's largest 
curbside recycling program, which eventually is intended to reach 720,000 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
"He is much too decent a man to be a saint," said City Councilwoman Ruth 
Galanter, a longtime recycling activist. "But I don't think you'll find anybody 
that doesn't respect the work that he has done. I'd much rather have him get 
rich from recycling than from polluting." 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, things were not so rosy. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, Petersen was back from a voyage he and his wife made to 23 countries 
around the world, and eager to start some kind of business that was 
"environmentally responsible" but could make him money as well. 
</P>
<P>
People thought he was crazy. And they resented his intention of making money 
from something traditionally done as volunteer or nonprofit work. 
</P>
<P>
But Petersen makes no apologies. "I'm from the '60s," he said in an interview 
this week. "I wanted to do . . . something really positive in the environmental 
area and make a business out of it. I had to find a vehicle, and recycling was 
it. I would have something tangible to sell." 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'We're going to institutionalize recycling -- make it something people 
do just like brushing their teeth. I've got to make it make money or nobody is 
going to listen to me.' At the time, people looked at me like I was Attila the 
Hun." 
</P>
<P>
And that was the reaction of his friends in the environmental movement. The 
strangers he greeted at their doorsteps and asked if they wanted to get rid of 
their garbage were less charitable. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, people would ask, 'What are you, some kind of communist?' " he 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
It took a while for things to get better, but they did, slowly. Petersen was 
able to quit his second job at the local Mayfair market and move his company, 
which he dubbed Ecolo-haul, into an office at the corner of Sepulveda and 
Ventura boulevards in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Starting with a small effort in several Westside communities in the early 
1970s, Ecolo-haul became one of the first coordinators in the nation of 
curbside recycling for single-family homes. It also set up a system of zoned 
collection for multifamily buildings and buy-back recycling centers. 
</P>

By the early 1980s, the company operated the largest network of community 
drop-off centers in the nation, with 36 in Southern California. By 1983, 
Ecolo-haul had offices in West Los Angeles, Santa Monica and Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Petersen designed and implemented for Santa Monica a citywide 
recycling program that is still regarded as the most comprehensive of its type 
in the nation. Ecolo-haul still recycles trash for Santa Monica and for a pilot 
recycling program the city of Los Angeles has begun in each council district. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Ecolo-haul now serves a community of 1 million people and has diverted 
about 500,000 tons of recyclable materials away from Los Angeles landfills. 
</P>

"Gary deserves credit for being one of the earliest pioneers and an innovator," 
said Los Angeles Councilman Marvin Braude, whose Pacific Palisades district was 
the location of the city's first and most comprehensive recycling effort. "He 
was a lone voice in those days, and one who took a lot of the hard knocks at 
first" from citizens and lawmakers resisting recycling. 
</P>
<P>
That Westside program is being copied in the recycling programs now under way 
in each of Los Angeles's 15 city council districts. 
</P>
<P>
Now that he works for Waste Management Inc., Petersen has no formal connection 
with the new citywide recycling program, but he has met with Mayor Bradley, his 
staff and city officials to discuss recycling efforts so many times over the 
years that he has lost count. "We are constantly working with them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Petersen has promoted recycling around the world. He has 
consulted with governments and private firms across the United States and in 
nine foreign countries, including Australia, Canada, China, England and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, big business has finally discovered what Petersen has been saying 
all along -- that there is good money in recycling. Attracted by potential 
profits and spurred by a proliferation of laws requiring recycling, the 
nation's five largest waste-handling corporations all started clamoring several 
years ago for Petersen's know-how and business savvy. He eventually decided 
sell Ecolo-haul to Waste Management, the largest company, in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Waste Management went after Ecolo-haul, according to Jane LaPorte, the 
company's vice president for recycling, because Petersen was "the pre-eminent 
recycler." 
</P>
<P>
"It was the right time, the right place and the right thing to do," she said. 
"Gary has been a tremendous advantage to us -- altruism is not one of the 
things we look for. We look at recycling as a money-making venture . . . and we 
use his skills wherever we can." 
</P>
<P>
Petersen continues to run Ecolo-haul, now a Waste Management subsidiary, and 
holds the title of vice president of Waste Management's California division. He 
helps the firm with its commercial and residential recycling contracts in more 
than 200 communities throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The coming years will be busy ones on the recycling front in California. After 
years of resistance to recycling, the Legislature has lately begun to take an 
interest. A container law implemented in 1987 provides for a 2 1/2-cent return 
for most beverage containers. Last year, lawmakers approved a bill that will 
require each city to recycle 25% of what it throws away by 1995 and 50% by the 
year 2000. To encourage compliance, the bill requires municipalities to submit 
plans in 1991 describing how those recycling goals will be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Petersen also is engaged in another, more personal project: He is restoring the 
VW van he started out with. 
</P>
<P>
"It reminds me of some of those days being out there at midnight, throwing 
newspapers in the pouring rain in Malibu, going, 'What am I doing here?' "
