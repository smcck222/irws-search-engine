AL MARTINEZ: RAISING THE FERTILE FRUIT FLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Al Martinez 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am indebted to the editor who passed me in the hall one day and said, "How do 
you raise a fertile fruit fly?" 
</P>
<P>
I have been in this business many years and am not unaccustomed to editors 
growling non sequiturs as they pass, trapped as they often are in their own 
improbable worlds. 
</P>
<P>
But I have learned that one never completely ignores an editor. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago in Oakland a passing editor who wasn't even looking at me asked, "How 
do you train a dog to dance?" and kept going. 
</P>
<P>
I ignored the question and was chewed out later for being beaten by the San 
Francisco Chronicle on the famous Berkeley Dancing Dog story. 
</P>
<P>
Editors, I learned from that experience, often assign stories in an offhand 
manner and expect at least a stick of type to result from their suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
We don't have sticks of type anymore, I don't think, but an editor's question, 
in whatever manner delivered, is still not to be taken lightly. 
</P>
<P>
To the fertile fruit fly comment, therefore, I asked the man what he meant. 
</P>
<P>
He said, well, if you wanted to be a Medfly terrorist and release flies capable 
of bearing young and waging war, where would you get them and how would you 
raise them? 
</P>
<P>
Then he shrugged and went about his business, leaving the question, as we used 
to write, hanging in the winter air. 
</P>
<P>
The man was alluding to a letter received by the mayor's office from a group 
that calls itself the Breeders, claiming responsibility for the current 
infestation of the Mediterranean fruit fly in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
The Breeders, according to the letter, want the aerial spraying of malathion to 
cease or they will spread fertile fruit flies throughout the state, thus 
placing California's crops in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
Fruit fly experts are unwilling to dismiss the letter as a joke because they 
can't explain certain elements of the infestation. Meanwhile, they keep on 
spraying and hope for the best. 
</P>
<P>
A good many non-terrorist citizens also object to the use of malathion, despite 
assurances that the chemical is harmless. 
</P>
<P>
If it's harmless, they ask quite reasonably, why are those living in the attack 
area cautioned to cover their cars and keep their children indoors during the 
spraying? 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the state Department of Food and Agriculture assured me once 
that health concerns over malathion were blown out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
"We use 2.4 ounces of malathion mixed with 9.6 ounces of corn syrup per acre," 
he said. "Think of it as a 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola. It's nothing. In Europe, 
they use malathion to control head lice." 
</P>
<P>
I asked Don Henry, deputy director of Project Medfly, if it were even possible 
for someone to raise Medflies for the purpose of waging guerrilla warfare 
against malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
He said, reluctantly, it was. 
</P>
<P>
Henry indicated that anyone capable of raising orchids or African violets could 
raise a fruit fly, though not for the same purpose, of course. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to go into detail," he said, "but you could raise a fruit fly in 
your garage." 
</P>
<P>
You have a fellow terrorist mail a larvae-infested mango from Hawaii and take 
it from there. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Islands," Henry said, "they raise 70 million sterile flies a week in an 
assembly-line lab. You couldn't raise that many fertile ones, but you could 
raise enough to cause headaches." 
</P>
<P>
It is my understanding that sterile male fruit flies are encouraged to mate 
with fertile female fruit flies. I don't know how they do that, but they do. 
</P>
<P>
The sexual act, though no doubt personally satisfying to the fly, produces no 
offspring, a situation that, one hopes, will eventually eliminate the strain. 
</P>
<P>
Henry says there are plenty of books available on raising insects that could be 
applied to Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to be an entomologist to raise Medflies any more than you have 
to be an ichthyologist to raise tropical fish," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to go into specifics, fearing, I suppose, that the publication of 
details could serve as a kind of Handbook on Fruit Fly Terrorism. I wouldn't 
want that. 
</P>
<P>
If there actually is a group called the Breeders, their tactics in the end will 
serve us poorly. 
</P>
<P>
For every fertile fruit fly the experts find, another Coke-sized can of 
malathion and corn syrup will be sprayed on us. While that might help with head 
lice, I'm worried about what it's doing to our heads. 
</P>
<P>
It's just a question here of whether the fruit fly terrorists or the malathion 
lords prevail. Either way, we lose.

FRONT SEAT FOR HONDA ACCORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten years ago the United Auto Workers' then-president Douglas A. Fraser, 
arguing for what a year later would become a "temporary" import quota on 
Japanese cars, proposed that the best way for Japan's auto makers to 
participate in the American market would be by building their own plants in the 
United States, manned by American labor. Within a short time the Japanese began 
to do just that, with impressive and now even historic results. Last year the 
Honda Accord emerged as the best-selling car in the United States, the first 
time a foreign-marque car achieved that distinction. Overall, Honda sold nearly 
783,000 cars in the United States, giving it a 7.9% share of the domestic 
market. About 390,000 of those cars were built in Honda's Ohio plants. 
</P>
<P>
The report comes shortly after the UAW's current president, Owen Bieber, called 
for cuts in Japan's exports to the United States from 2.3 million cars to 1.5 
million, arguing that such a reduction is warranted because Japanese-owned 
plants in the States now make about 750,000 cars. 
</P>
<P>
This notion that there should be compensatory reductions in imports as domestic 
output grows has interesting implications, given that before too long Japanese 
auto makers plan to have a North American production capacity of more than 2 
million cars. At that point could we expect to see advocates of protectionism 
demanding a full cutoff of car imports from Japan, and maybe even a halt to 
further construction of Japanese auto plants in the United States? We wouldn't 
be surprised. 
</P>
<P>
What has gone before is a shameful and costly assault on the interests of 
American consumers, beginning with the 1981 imposition of auto-import quotas 
that was supposed to last no more than three years while the U.S. auto industry 
retooled to meet the challenge of foreign competition. The temporary "breathing 
space" lobbied for by the industry has lasted through the decade. Now, as if 
quotas weren't enough, the suggestion is being raised that Japanese car makers 
should be prepared to accept a ceiling on the percentage of the American car 
market they are entitled to have. 
</P>
<P>
The Honda Accord's place at the head of the 1989 sales parade might encourage 
further such suggestions. They ought to be rejected for the nonsense they are. 
In a free economy, market share isn't something that's assigned; it's something 
to be won in open and fair competition for consumer loyalties. When Honda does 
well in the U.S. market, or Ford or Toyota or whatever, it's because consumers 
like what these companies have to offer. The name of the game, as always, is 
competition. Last year the Honda Accord just happened to compete a little 
better. For 1990 the field is wide open.

IRS AND PHONY DEPENDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again an editorial in The Times focuses on the micro and ignores the 
macro. Yes, it's true, computers can give us the power to squeeze taxpayers for 
every penny due the government, and the IRS is well-known for using computers 
like Jimmy Connors uses a tennis racket. 
</P>
<P>
When outrage at an exercise of power without due process is appropriate 
(requiring parents to "register" their 2-year-old babies with a bureaucracy 
heretofore empowered to issue numbers to "working people," i.e., people old 
enough to hold a job!), The Times instead exhibits pious glee at the IRS' 
computerized efficiency in collecting taxes. The Times shirks its civic duty, 
trust and responsibility when it fails to point out these subtle, grievous and 
insidious governmental incursions into our lives. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, something must be done to bring tax cheaters to account, but a free 
society cannot long endure when $2.8 billion in taxes is all that stands 
between dignity and respect for all of our unnumbered children and Uncle Sam's 
depleted coffers. 
</P>
<P>
The tax monies accrued by using this reprehensible program will never begin to 
equal the loss of privacy to citizens. 
</P>
<P>
My Social Security number was issued to me, and proudly accepted by me, at the 
advanced age of 14. I remember it as a proud rite of passage. It meant that I 
had a job. The number was for people who work! Not babies! 
</P>
<P>
I fear that as a nation of free people we are in great peril when a major 
newspaper like The Times fails to see the real violation of our rights as 
private persons.

SPECIAL PROBLEMS OF HOMELESS FAMILIES AND MENTALLY ILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for your excellent editorial. According to Dr. E. Fuller Torrey in 
his book "Nowhere to Go: The Tragic Odyssey of the Homeless Mentally Ill," a 
minimum of one-third of the homeless in the United States are seriously 
mentally ill -- mostly with schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
The mentally ill have mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters and children who 
suffer daily from the frustration of not being able to help their family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
I have a paranoid-schizophrenic sister who left home to live in a camper truck 
with her 10-year-old son, parking on the streets at night. In her paranoid 
world, she is afraid her family wants to lock her away and take her son. 
</P>
<P>
Even though I have the financial resources to help, only someone who is an 
"immediate danger to themselves or others" can be helped against their will. 
Meanwhile, my nephew has to endure his mother's shadowy paranoid-schizophrenic 
world. 
</P>
<P>
There are so many families with similar problems that we have a support group: 
The California Alliance for the Mentally Ill -- a statewide organization. Your 
local Alliance for the Mentally Ill can be reached by calling (818) 441-0208.

Neo-Prussianism should be spotlighted as much as neo-Nazism ("East Germans 
Warned of Neo-Nazism," Part A, Dec. 28). 
</P>
<P>
Already East Germans are demanding return of parts of former Prussia now in 
Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Union with the European Community at Strasbourg is the road to the future. 
Reunion of the Germanys through the Brandenburg Gate is the road back to a

I got a big laugh while reading Koblosh's letter detailing the problems he has 
had with his 1985 Dodge. May I present the following problems I have 
experienced with my 1983 Toyota pickup truck: 
</P>
<P>
Four brake failures; 2 headlight replacements less than 1 year after purchase; 
total brake failure; refusal to repair damaged right wing window while under 
warranty; need for 4 new tires less than 2 years after purchase (less than 
25,000 miles driven); replacement of timing chain; cracked bearing; total 
engine failure -- 4 years after purchase; battery cable failure; replacement of 
entire fuel pump system. 
</P>
<P>
I could go on, but I think I've made my point. Do you think I'll ever buy 
anything made by Toyota? No way!

I have been the sole owner of a 1985 Pontiac Grand Am. 
</P>
<P>
In its service to me of over 53,000 miles I had but one problem, with the fuel 
pump. Even the tires, battery and brakes lasted nearly 50,000 miles; still 
going on the original hoses and belts. The paint job is phenomenal, still shiny 
and new looking. In my 63 years I have had at least 6 U.S. cars, bought new, 
some driven well over 100,000 miles with very few problems. If I didn't love my 
present car so much I'd buy a new domestic car.

Time magazine names Mikhail Gorbachev "Man of the Decade." Commentators in The 
Times applaud him for his progressive policies, stating that his policies have 
assisted the democratization of Eastern Europe (editorial, "Man of the Decade's 
Challenge," Dec. 29). 
</P>
<P>
Why not give credit where it's due? 
</P>
<P>
For nine years, first Ronald Reagan and then George Bush have insisted that 
America's military remain strong, and have assisted anti-communist rebels and 
regimes worldwide, notably in Afghanistan, Africa and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
In trying to counteract this military pressure, Russia has bankrupted its 
puppet dictatorships by forcing them to feed the Russian people and arm the 
Russian military. Now that the Warsaw Pact economies are on the verge of 
collapse, Gorbachev allows them to go democratic, hoping, no doubt, that when 
the real crunch hits in February or March, it will be blamed on the new order, 
and that repressive policies will be put back in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Liberals are calling for massive reductions in the U.S. defense budget now. I 
suggest we postpone any cuts until free elections are allowed in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev is a chess player. In chess, until the king is captured, it doesn't 
matter how many pawns are sacrificed.

"The Homeless Are Getting Younger" was an appropriate editorial for Christmas 
Day. Although you stated that 36% of the homeless are families with young 
children it is important to understand what these numbers mean. 
</P>
<P>
Children cannot learn if they are hungry. Children cannot feel secure or good 
about themselves if they have no home. Children cannot play if they have no 
sleep. And, worst of all, children cannot laugh when they have nothing. 
</P>
<P>
According to the state Department of Social Services' most recent statistics, 
between 156,000 and 200,00 children were homeless during 1989. We estimate the 
number of homeless children in Los Angeles to be at least 50,000 based on the 
DSS statistics. 
</P>

The homeless assistance program, which is jointly funded by California and the 
federal government, provides for three to four weeks of temporary shelter in 
addition to last month's rent and security deposit. Although this successful 
program has assisted 80,000 families in 1989, this is only a slice of the 
homeless family population. 
</P>
<P>
Many families are not AFDC eligible or do not qualify for these funds. If one 
parent is working more than 100 hours a month, or if the family is undocumented 
they do not qualify for this program. There is still fear among homeless 
families that their children could be taken from them. Therefore, many families 
are afraid to admit being homeless and will not apply for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Your editorial also mentioned that 1,800 people were being turned away from our 
shelters each night. Although we are increasing the number of shelter beds 
yearly in Los Angeles, our shelters are not the answer to homelessness. People 
need housing that is safe, decent and affordable. 
</P>
<P>
We must urge Congress to restore the $25 billion of federal housing funds that 
were lost over the last eight years. It has been estimated that California 
needs over 800,000 affordable housing units. State Senate President Pro Tem 
David Roberti has recognized the shortage of affordable housing as a major 
cause of homelessness and has developed the Housing and Homeless Bond Act for 
the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Congress requires each state to prepare a plan to educate all homeless 
children. The purpose of the plan is to ensure access to school for homeless 
children and youth and to promote quality education and equal access to special 
programs and services. The state Department of Education is "encouraging" 
school districts to adopt the plan. However, to date, little has been done. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that homelessness is getting younger, especially in California. We 
must recognize the disastrous effect of homelessness on our children and 
support affordable housing programs, education programs and other essential 
programs that work with homeless and at-risk populations. Are we going to allow 
another decade of children to experience homelessness, hunger and a lack of 
appropriate education? Let's make sure that we give laughter and joy back to 
our children in the 1990s.

Larry Stewart was 99.9% correct. I reserve the other .1% because he omitted Ken 
Brett. Brett can be informative for a spell, but when he was relieving Al Conin 
for a spell, I didn't have the foggiest idea where the ball was going or what 
happened until I read the paper the next day.

Finally, with regard to KABC's radio "personality," the worst crime is that

I'm amazed that KABC continues to air (Ed Bieler's) mediocrity.

TOUTING TOUT SHEETS: NOT A LOT TO TOOT ABOUT

I was pleasantly surprised to see Kelly Burgess' article (and statistics) 
"Rating the Sheets." It's something that's long overdue, and I'd like to see it 
become a regular thing. 
</P>
<P>
Of added interest was that The Times' own Bob Mieszerski (83 winners) as well 
as your consensus (76 wins) outperformed all the sheets (and the Racing Form's 
consensus). Also noteworthy is that every "card" showed a flat bet loss on $2 
win bets. (The best of them recovering only $478 of the $540 bet.) 
</P>
<P>
Sort of wish I knew how they all did on plain "top choice" bets on doubles, 
triples, exactas, pick six, etc. If I were to take a chance betting on someone 
else's selections, it'd sure be no more than one or two combinations -- surely 
not $54 just on a single triple, as they might "suggest."

What was Mike Downey smoking the day Notre Dame played Miami? 
</P>
<P>
He obviously wasn't watching his "No. 1" team get kicked. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Irish should be "fighting mad," but not because they were outvoted 
in the polls -- rather, because they were duped into believing they were even 
playing for the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Downey blames a second-rate selection system when the fault lies in some 
third-rate bowl game matchups: How the loser of the Notre Dame-Miami game ends 
up playing the No. 1 team in the Orange Bowl; the loser of the Alabama-Auburn 
game ends up playing No. 2 team in the Sugar Bowl; and the country's hottest 
team (Florida State) doesn't even get a shot at Notre Dame, Auburn or Miami is 
a mystery.

ESPERANZA HANDS LOARA ITS FIRST LOSS OF SEASON

<P>
Loara High School, which had been the only undefeated boys' basketball team in 
Orange County, fell from the ranks of the unbeaten Friday night, losing to 
Esperanza, 67-65, in the Empire League opener for both schools at Esperanza 
High. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Tes Whitlock, who had led Loara to 11 consecutive victories to open the 
season, missed a 25-foot jump shot with four seconds remaining as Esperanza 
held off a last-minute rally. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked our chances of winning with the ball in Tes' hands in the final 
seconds," said Jerry Halpin, Loara coach. "We got good shots all night, but 
this was the first time in 12 games that our shots didn't fall." 
</P>
<P>
Loara made only 24 of 68 shots and was only three of 16 from three-point range. 
Whitlock was Loara's only consistent scorer with 25 points, but the junior 
guard also was cited for a costly technical foul with 4:44 remaining in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza guard Walter Forcatto made a pair of free throws and Seth Romans 
scored on the ensuing inbounds play to give Esperanza a 62-56 lead and Loara 
never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
"Tes thought he got fouled and said something he shouldn't have said to the 
referee," Halpin said. "He knew he made a mistake as soon as he said something. 
But he almost got us back in the game. Everybody was waiting on the edge of 
their seats to see if he made that last shot." 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza (8-7) was in control most of the fourth quarter, opening a 
seven-point lead when Romans scored on follow shot with 6:42 remaining to push 
Esperanza ahead, 55-48. 
</P>
<P>
Forcatto and Romans took turns dogging Whitlock most of the night and held him 
to three points below his season average of 28 points. Whitlock scored more 
than half of his points off steals at midcourt, forcing eight turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal was to limit Tes' possessions and cut his scoring in half," said Mark 
Hill, Esperanza coach. "Romans and Forcatto did an excellent job. I told the 
players before the game that we're real close to being a good team, and I think 
we proved that tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Forward Joe Foss led Esperanza with 23 points and 10 rebounds before fouling 
out late in the fourth quarter. Forcatto added 18 points and teammate Matt 
Thimgan added six points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos 69, Katella 33 -- The Griffins held the host Knights scoreless for 
the first 4:28 of the game and led, 22-2, at the end of the first quarter. Mike 
Wilson scored 15 points for the Griffins (11-5, 1-0). Robert Conlisk and Jason 
Cunningham each scored 14 for Los Alamitos. Kevin Carlson scored 19 for Katella 
(4-10, 0-1). 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado 90, Cypress 75 -- Cypress' Gerard Rice, a 5-9 guard, scored 40 
points, but it wasn't enough at Cypress. Jerome Facione had 28 points and 14 
rebounds to lead El Dorado (10-5, 1-0). Mike Bradach added 22 points and Gary 
Smith 21 for the Golden Hawks. Emmitt Smith had 10 points for Cypress (7-8, 
0-1).

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 12 years as Mission Viejo High School basketball coach, Bob Minier has 
seen his share of wild games. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that is why after witnessing a particularly tense game -- one that 
included a quick bench-clearing brawl in the fourth quarter -- Minier was 
somewhat ho-hum. 
</P>
<P>
"A typical South Coast League (game)," Minier said calmly, minutes after his 
team's 54-43 victory in the South Coast League opener for both teams at Mission 
Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a hard-fought opener, I'd say." 
</P>
<P>
Say it again and you'd still be short of exaggeration. Although Mission Viejo 
opened a 7-0 lead in the game's first four minutes, Dana Hills came back and 
dogged the Diablos' every move. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills never led, though it was always in contention until midway through 
the fourth quarter. That's when Mission Viejo went on an 8-0 run, holding Dana 
Hills scoreless for 3 minutes 40 seconds, to gain a 46-36 lead with 2:35 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills cut its deficit to 47-41 on a three-point shot by Brett Blauvelt. 
But seconds later, Dana Hills junior guard Keith Barnett got into a scuffle 
with Mission Viejo's Bill Denny, and by the time both benches cleared, Barnett, 
Denny and Dana Hills' Glenn Wilkerson were ejected from the game with 34 
seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
From there, Mission Viejo (10-4 overall, 1-0 in league play) made seven of 12 
free throws to clinch the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo received balanced scoring from Eric Cramer (14 points), Mike 
Boucher (13), Tom Merk (11) and Greg Amaya (11). 
</P>
<P>
Barnett led Dana Hills (12-4, 0-1) with 13 points. J.B. Taylor added 12. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them we were right there all the way," Dana Hills Coach Tom Riach said. 
"We had some key opportunities. But we came out real tight. That's kind of 
unusual for us. But all in all, I wasn't displeased with the effort." 
</P>
<P>
Both teams shot poorly from the field. Mission Viejo made 18 of 50 (36%) from 
the field, and Dana Hills, which seemed to have significant troubles with the 
Diablos' 2-3 zone defense, was just 15 of 59 (25%). 
</P>
<P>
In South Coast League games: 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley 86, San Clemente 63 -- Scott McCorkle had 31 points to lead 
Capistrano Valley (10-5). Chris Kostoff had 22 points and Brett McCorkle added 
14 for the winners. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro 60, Irvine 45 -- Rob Johnson scored 23 points to lead El Toro (12-2, 
1-0) at Irvine. The Chargers took control in the third quarter by outscoring 
the Vaqueros, 19-12, to take a 47-35 lead. John Molle scored 17 points to lead 
Irvine (8-9, 0-1).

NO. 1 MATER DEI SMOOTH AS GLASS WHILE BEATING ST. PAUL, 95-61

<P>
When your basketball team is 14-1 and ranked No. 1 in Orange County, it can be 
tough to find faults. 
</P>
<P>
But if you're Mater Dei High School Coach Gary McKnight, you just look 
underneath your feet. His problem wasn't basketball players Friday night, but 
the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
The basketball court at St. Paul High, where visiting Mater Dei beat the 
Swordsmen, 95-61, is a slick, painted concrete surface as opposed to the 
standard hardwood. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of being able to enjoy watching his team cruise to an easy victory, 
McKnight winced every time one of his players made a cut off a pick, and prayed 
that nobody would dive for a loose ball. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a Slip 'n Slide out there," McKnight said. "It's like a Boys Club court. 
Someone needs to do something about that court before someone gets seriously 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
The slick surface didn't bother McKnight's starting five, who built a 67-39 
lead before McKnight cleared the bench in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Stone, a 6-foot-8 center, led the Monarchs with 20 points, and swingman 
David Boyle added 17. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei point guard Jason Quinn had 13 points and seven assists, all in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Karich and Dan O'Neil had nine points apiece. Karich added eight rebounds 
and eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs also forced 23 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul (3-9) cut the deficit by bombing from the outside in the second half, 
but the long rebounds only served to feed Mater Dei's fast break. 
</P>
<P>
"That's St. Paul's style," McKnight said. "They either shoot themselves into 
the game or they shoot themselves out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Edgar Diaz led St. Paul inside with 15 points, and sophomore guard Brandon 
Ertle added 15. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul also got 10 points from reserve freshman Eric Gutierrez, who connected 
on a pair of 25- footers in the first half.

Published comments by Valley College player Shelton Boykin and three other 
former members of the Texas-El Paso basketball program have led the NCAA to 
begin an investigation of the program, Texas-El Paso Athletic Director Brad 
Hovious said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not feel we are guilty of any wrongdoing, but the publicity generated by 
these stories has caused the NCAA to begin a preliminary inquiry into this 
matter," Hovious said. "The NCAA has not given us any specific allegations."

<P>
Remarks by Boykin in the Times' Valley edition Dec. 15 suggested possible rules 
violations at UTEP. 
</P>
<P>
"When we wanted to go out, we'd get a car," Boykin was quoted as saying. "They 
were nice cars, Cadillacs, Mercedes, Jaguars. . . . The coaches didn't loan the 
cars, but people around the area did. The coaches went by the books, but the 
people, that's a different story." 
</P>
<P>
Boykin, who played for UTEP as a freshman in the 1987-88 season, later claimed 
he had been misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like, if you wanted a ride somewhere, there were some friends around -- 
just like we have friends out here -- that come pick us up and take us places," 
Boykin said after the Times story appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Former UTEP assistant coach Nate Archibald and former players Jerry Jones and 
Sean Harris alluded to similar violations in a story printed last year in 
Newsday, a Long Island, N. Y., newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Newsday quoted the players, who left the basketball program without explanation 
during the 1987-88 season, as saying they received cash and free use of cars 
from "shoogs" -- sugar daddies. 
</P>
<P>
The players later claimed that they were misquoted. 
</P>
<P>
Hovious said he has investigated, but has found no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA could find problems that he failed to discover, Hovious said, adding 
that he doesn't know the scope of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is kind of like the IRS . . . you've paid your tax but you don't know if 
you'd paid it all," Hovious said. 
</P>
<P>
NCAA investigators this week are expected to begin a stay of up to two weeks on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore forward David Van Dyke said the investigation would not hurt the 
Miners, who are off to a 7-5 start. "Yeah, it comes at a bad time, but it 
should end real quick," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Calls to Coach Don Haskins' home and office were not answered. 
</P>
<P>
The UTEP basketball program never has been on probation.

SAN FERNANDO, COACH ON ROLL IN 1-POINT WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Fernando High basketball Coach Dick Crowell's courtside chair -- one that 
includes a built-in seat cushion and caster wheels -- isn't of the standard 
sideline variety. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it allows Crowell to expand the limits of the coaching box, in a 
crab-like scoot. And while the Crowell Crawl lets him cover lots of hardwood, 
it has other advantages, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured it would be more comfortable than one of those things they make in 
the state prison," Crowell said. 
</P>
<P>
After San Fernando defeated Kennedy, 64-63, in a Northwest Valley Conference 
opener at San Fernando on Friday night, Crowell almost needed some time in a 
padded cell. 
</P>
<P>
In a game as closely contested as Crowell's sanity could stand, San Fernando 
(8-3) finally took the lead for good -- and for the third time all night -- 
with six seconds left when Russell Baldwin took an inbounds pass and drove for 
a virtually uncontested layup. 
</P>
<P>
Why does Crowell tend to go crazy over stuff like this? Not for the obvious 
reasons, such as for the thrill of winning. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to go to Russell on the inbounds pass," he said. "But (Lance) 
Whitaker was supposed to set a pick, then roll to the basket. Well, Russell 
came out too high, Whitaker forgot the pick, and what can I say?" 
</P>
<P>
The last-ditch comeback by San Fernando wrecked a brilliant individual effort 
by Kennedy off-guard Garret Anderson, who scored a game-high 27 points and 
knocked down five of six three-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin, who had two fouls in the first five minutes and was largely 
ineffective until the fourth quarter, saved the best for last. The 6-foot-5 
senior scored 10 of his team-high 17 points in the fourth quarter, and made 
five of six free throws in the period. "Truthfully, I'm a pretty good 
free-throw shooter," said Baldwin, who canned two free throws with 51 seconds 
remaining to tie the score, 61-61. "I practiced every day at my house -- until 
the hoop got torn down." 
</P>
<P>
Guess again, says the man in the rubber chair. 
</P>
<P>
"All season long, it's been, 'Make one, miss the second,' " Crowell said of 
Baldwin's experiences at the line. "Tonight, I was just praying he'd make the 
second one, too." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (7-6, 0-1) certainly didn't tear down any backboards in the fourth 
quarter. The Golden Cougars took a 56-50 lead on Alan Johnson's bank shot with 
6:05 left. And following a technical foul that was charged to the San Fernando 
bench, Anderson made two free throws with 5:40 remaining for a 58-51 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, however, did not make another field goal until Josh Etting -- who 
finished with 20 points -- scored inside with 1:01 left, giving the Golden 
Cougars a 61-60 lead. Kennedy also turned the ball over seven times in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
After Baldwin scored off the inbounds pass with six seconds left, Kennedy 
called time out, and got the ball into Anderson's hands at midcourt with three 
seconds left. Anderson, however, was hounded by a San Fernando triple-team, and 
was unable to fire off a shot. 
</P>
<P>
Marco Renteria, who finished with 13 points, contributed a critical pair of 
free throws with 1:13 left, giving the Tigers their first lead of the game 
since they led, 2-0, in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Renteria made five of six from the line overall, offsetting the troubles of 
teammate Errol Garnett, who missed the front end of three one-and-one attempts 
in the fourth quarter.

CLEVELAND PROVES TOO MUCH FOR OUTMANNED CHATSWORTH IN STORMING TO 55-POINT WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM COLEMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The word "Chatsworth" was plastered across the front of their jerseys as clear 
as day, but Friday night the Chatsworth High basketball team sure looked a lot 
like the old Washington Generals, those foils the Harlem Globetrotters still 
run rings around. 
</P>
<P>
And the Chancellors had about as much chance of beating Cleveland as the 
Generals do of whipping the Globetrotters. 
</P>
<P>
As routs go, Cleveland's 87-32 lambasting of Chatsworth in a Northwest Valley 
Conference opener is about as bad as it gets. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibit A: Chatsworth (3-7), which starts two sophomores and has no players 
with varsity experience, turned the ball over the first seven times down the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibit B: When the Chancellors did finally take a shot nearly four minutes 
into the first period, it was blocked. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibit C: Chatsworth, which had 14 turnovers in the first period and 34 total, 
shot 21% from the field in the first half and 29% for the game. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibit D: The Chancellors trailed, 22-4, after the first quarter and 47-13 at 
intermission, when their leading scorer was Delvon Hardaway, with three points. 
</P>
<P>
It was so ugly that Cleveland Coach Marc Paez was making wholesale 
substitutions as early as the second period. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we could control it a little bit, but we didn't control it at all," 
Chatsworth Coach Gary Shair said. "I'm frustrated. We'll never have a chance 
against Cleveland." 
</P>
<P>
Shair's frustration was evident when he was whistled for back-to-back technical 
fouls in the third period, resulting in four free throws by Cleveland's Joe 
Eddings. It didn't much matter -- Chatsworth trailed, 63-15, at the time. 
</P>
<P>
It was just another night at the office for Cleveland (11-3), winners of 10 of 
its last 11. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers led, 14-0, before Chatsworth even took a shot. Eddie Hill and 
Brandon Martin each had 12 points by halftime -- only one less than the 
Chatsworth team. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't go in expecting a rout. There's always a little bit of fear 
for me in any game," Paez said with a straight face. "I thought our starters 
went in and did what they had to do. They created a big spread, and we were 
able to put our other kids in at an early juncture." 
</P>
<P>
Shair, for one, was pleased Cleveland didn't rub salt in the open wound that 
was his team. 
</P>
<P>
"They could have been worse," Shair said. "But he played everybody. He didn't 
rub it in. I appreciate that." 
</P>
<P>
Martin led Cleveland with a game-high 17 points. Hill and reserve center 
Patrick McCook each scored 12, and Eddings added 11 off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Dumbar was the lone to Chancellor to reach double figures, scoring 11 
points -- three on a three-point basket that put Chatsworth over 30 points for 
the game.

ANTELOPE VALLEY BRINGS HOME 69-53 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There's no place like home. 
</P>
<P>
Especially for the Antelope Valley High basketball team, which has spent so 
much time on the road this season the Antelopes were beginning to click the 
heels of their hightops and sing about rainbows and yellow brick roads. 
</P>
<P>
"I was beginning to feel like Dorothy in 'The Wizard of Oz,' " Coach Skip Adams 
said. "I wanted to go home." 
</P>
<P>
Home is where the Antelopes like to play. It's where they lost just one game 
all of last season. And where they had played just one game this season before 
Friday night's Golden League opener against Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
And it's also where the fired-up Antelopes (13-3 overall) defeated Canyon, 
69-53, before a packed gym that cheered the defending league champs for the 
first time in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Our road record was good and that will make us road-tough (for the playoffs)," 
Adams said. "But we've been struggling with our outside shooting. I wished that 
tonight we would finally get hot." 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't take a wizard to realize that when the weather cools off in the high 
desert, Antelope Valley's shooting heats up. 
</P>
<P>
The Antelopes made 28 of 50 shots from the field, including eight of 11 in the 
third quarter when they outscored Canyon, 19-9, to turn a close game into a 
56-38 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The Antelopes also buried eight of 12 three-point shots, including four by 
guard B. J. Petersen (14 points) and three by reserve guard Bobby Paiz (11). 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley led, 19-17, after one quarter, but outscored the Cowboys, 
18-12, in the second quarter to take a 37-29 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Petersen, guard Brock Chase and Paiz hit consecutive three-point shots to open 
the second quarter. Paiz connected on two consecutive three-point baskets to 
open the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that we came back home, we're better in our shooting," Chase said. 
</P>
<P>
Said senior forward Chris Walters, who penetrated Canyon's defense for a 
game-high 15 points: "It gives everybody a chance to see us instead of just 
reading about us in the newspapers. The crowd starts cheering for us and the 
guys start getting a lot of open shots." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon Coach Greg Hayes, whose team dropped to 11-4, reasoned that the game 
would have gone Antelope Valley's way in any venue -- even in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't the arena, they just outhustled us," Hayes said. "In the third 
quarter they just killed us. We weren't in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Senior forward Jermaine Nixon led Canyon with 13 points but scored only four in 
the fourth quarter while the Cowboys tried to play catchup.

Kim Eproson and the Cal State Los Angeles women's basketball team broke Cal 
Lutheran's school-record five-game winning streak with a convincing 80-66 
victory Friday night at Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
Eproson came off the bench to pour in a game-high 25 points, 23 in the second 
half, to help Cal State L. A. (6-7) break a six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
"(Eproson) was just amazing," Cal Lutheran Coach Norm Chung said. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't stop her. We didn't let her get any shots simply standing 
stationary. We made her work for her shots. She just didn't miss." 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly, but pretty close. 
</P>
<P>
Eproson made 10 of 18 field-goal attempts, mostly on long-distance bombs, and 
she sank five of six free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The Regals (9-3) led, 46-45, with 12 minutes, 46 seconds to play before Eproson 
went to work. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-7 junior guard scored the Eagles' next 10 points in a 4:26 span, all 
on outside shooting to give Cal State L. A. a 55-50 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran pulled to within a point, 61-60, with 4:16 to play when Joy Fuller 
made a layup. But Cal State L. A. went on a 14-1 blitz with Eproson scoring 10 
of the 14 to seal the win. 
</P>
<P>
Lori Thompson scored 16 points and Kelly O'Brien added 12 and 15 rebounds for 
Cal State L. A. 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Lee led Cal Lutheran with 16 points, 12 rebounds and five steals. Leslie 
Stevens chipped in with 12. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Cal State L. A. led, 20-9, but Cal Lutheran closed to 34-32 
by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State L. A. hit 52% from the field in the second half on 16-of-31 shooting 
while limiting Cal Lutheran to 34% (13 of 31). KIRBY LEE In another women's 
game: Antelope Valley 63, Citrus 49 -- Antelope Valley improved to 2-0 in the 
Foothill Conference with a victory at Citrus. Forward Denese Prince led 
Antelope Valley (7-7) with 15 points and grabbed 10 rebounds. Susan Hervey had 
a team-high 15 rebounds.MEN West L. A. 89, Canyons 88 -- Holding a one-point 
lead with 12 seconds remaining, West L. A. missed the front end of two 
different one-and-ones but managed to grab the offensive rebound both times and 
deny Canyons an opportunity for a come-from-behind win in a Western State 
Conference game at Canyons. Larry Allbritton led Canyons (7-12, 0-2) with 26 
points and fellow forward Aaron Clark scored 20. Canyons' Nick Sanderson scored 
21. Cal Poly SLO 80, Master's 74 -- Cal Poly had a 76-71 lead in the last four 
minutes and held on.

HARVARD TOPS BELL-JEFF IN LEAGUE OPENER AS WEISS SCORES HAT TRICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andrew Weiss, in his first match since he twisted an ankle against San Fernando 
on Dec. 28, scored a hat trick in leading Harvard High to a 5-1 thumping of 
Bell-Jeff in a San Fernando Valley League opener Friday at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss, a striker, scored goals at the 10- and 12-minute marks in the first half 
to give Harvard a 2-0 lead. Greg Harlan's 23-yard free kick with 11 minutes 
left in the half gave the Saracens a 3-0 advantage at the break. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard outshot the Guards, 26-8, but Coach Barclay Mackinnon said he was 
disappointed his Saracens did not score more. 
</P>
<P>
"They played a very hard defensive track that left a lot of holes open for us," 
he said. "Weiss could have easily had six or seven goals." 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder David Moran made the score 4-0 with a shot from 15 yards 15 minutes 
into the second half. Bell-Jeff trimmed the deficit to 4-1 on a corner kick two 
minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss capped Harvard's scoring with a goal at the 29-minute mark. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Rob Faucett recorded six saves in goal for the Saracens (8-2-3). 
</P>
<P>
In other boys' matches: 
</P>
<P>
L. A. Baptist 3, Village Christian 0 -- Striker Dan Stepper scored from three 
and 25 yards out to lead the Knights (10-1-2) in an Alpha League opener at L. 
A. Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
Stepper scored 15 seconds before halftime to give L. A. Baptist a 1-0 lead. 
Chris Herthel's head shot from five yards out after a Paul Berry free kick put 
the Knights ahead, 2-0, at the three-minute mark of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Village Christian is 3-5-1. 
</P>
<P>
St. Francis 3, St. John Bosco 1 -- The first time Kevin Hurley touched the ball 
in a Del Rey League opener at St. Francis, he scored for the Golden Knights, 
who are ranked No. 6 in the Southern Section 3-A Division. 
</P>

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: MAKING THE NEW YEAR A MORE PROFITABLE ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Sing 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's New Year's resolution time. You've probably decided to lose weight. Make 
new friends. Improve your golf game. 
</P>
<P>
This year, why not add some personal finance resolutions as well? Resolve to 
get your financial house in order. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a checklist of some common sense resolutions, designed to make you 
richer -- or at least more savvy in managing your money: 
</P>
<P>
* Figure out where you stand. Many people haven't the foggiest notion of the 
state of their financial affairs. So they have no realistic idea how much they 
really need to save and earn to provide for a secure retirement, their kids' 
college education or other financial goals. So make out a net-worth statement 
that lists what you own and what you owe. Include the value of your pension 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
Also, do a cash-flow statement to figure out where your money goes. Get out 
your financial statements -- canceled checks, credit card statements, bills and 
the like -- and list how much money comes in and where it goes. If you are 
spending more than you are taking in, then it's time to make a budget and 
control your spending. 
</P>
<P>
* Make money the easy way: save. What's the easiest (legal) way to make money? 
Spend less of what you already have. It's easier to save a dollar you've 
already earned (which has already been taxed) than to earn a new one (which is 
going to get taxed). So eat out once a week less, or resist that temptation to 
buy the new suit you really don't need anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Also, get rid of what you don't need. Do you have life insurance but no 
dependents? You really don't need a policy in that case. 
</P>
<P>
* Be realistic about risk. Learn from those unfortunate folks who bought 
high-yielding bonds at Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan thinking they were federally 
insured. Any time you see an investment with higher-than-normal returns, 
resolve to be extra careful knowing that higher yields always mean higher risk. 
</P>
<P>
* Stop giving free loans to Uncle Sam. That's what you're doing every year when 
you get a big tax refund. That money was yours, but you let the government have 
the use of it all year -- without even paying you any interest! Isn't it enough 
that you are paying taxes in the first place? This year, adjust your 
withholding so you don't have such a big refund. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't be a sucker. Still have one of those 5.25% passbook savings accounts? 
Get a higher paying money market mutual fund or at least a certificate of 
deposit. You got a credit card charging you 21% interest? Cards charging much 
lower rates are readily available. 
</P>
<P>
* Pay down credit card debts. Starting in 1991, you won't be able to deduct any 
of your credit card interest payments from your taxable income. 
</P>
<P>
* Cut down on excessive fees. Quit buying those mutual funds charging you a 6% 
or 8.5% load (sales commission). There are dozens of no-load funds that perform 
just as well or better, and saving those up-front charges will let more of your 
money work for you. 
</P>
<P>
* Diversify. Is all your money in Treasury bills or certificates of deposit? If 
you're still far off from retirement with a whole life of work earnings ahead 
of you, you can afford to be more creative and aggressive. A portfolio spread 
out among stocks, bonds, savings and real estate performs better in the long 
run. 
</P>
<P>
* Think long term. You think that because the Dow Jones industrial index 
tumbled 190 points on Oct. 13 that the market is more volatile? How much on 
average did it go up or down the other days of the year? Hardly at all. Think 
long term, and put those short-term panics into proper perspective. 
</P>
<P>
* Just say no. Next time a stranger calls you and tries to sell you on some hot 
new investment, hang up. That's the best way to avoid getting ripped off in 
investment swindles.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: CAPITAL LOSSES MAY BE CARRIED FORWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
QUESTION: I lost a total of $36,000 in American Continental Corp. 
debenturesCarla Lazzareschi 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
more than twice my annual income! May I spread this loss over two or three 
years, or am I entitled to apply it against my annual income only in the year 
during which the loss occurred. I don't want to lose any opportunity I might 
have to write off these losses. -- M. N. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: The American Continental Corp. and Lincoln Savings debacle obviously 
hit many of our readers very hard. So although we have addressed how to handle 
capital losses on your tax filings in previous columns, we'll do it one more 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Your losses are fully deductible, although it may take you several years to 
take full advantage of the deduction. Here's how it works: In any given tax 
year, capital losses may be used to offset the full extent of any capital gains 
you receive from other investments. So, if you had generated gains of $36,000 
this year from other investments, the two would cancel each other out. 
</P>
<P>
But if your losses exceed your gains, as is your situation, the unused portion 
can offset only up to $3,000 per year of ordinary income. You may save the 
unused portion of the capital losses and deduct it in future years from either 
capital gains or ordinary income. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you have capital gains from investments this year of $10,000, 
you would be able to offset those, plus deduct an additional $3,000 from your 
other income. The remaining $23,000 in losses could be carried forward to the 
next tax year. On that tax return, you could use those losses to offset capital 
gains income of as much as $23,000. Or, if you have less than $23,000 in 
capital gains income, you can offset that income and deduct up to $3,000 
against ordinary income. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, any remaining capital loss can be similarly used and carried 
forward until the entire $36,000 loss is used up. Use Schedule D of the tax 
form to report capital gains and losses. 
</P>
<P>
How Taxes Work on First IRA Distribution 
</P>
<P>
Q: My wife turned age 70 1/2 last year. Her individual retirement account 
matures next month. She plans to withdraw all the funds in the account on its 
maturity date. Will she have to pay income taxes on the amount for the 1989 tax 
year, since that is the year she turned age 70 1/2, or may she pay the tax when 
we file our forms for the 1990 tax year? -- A. G. N. 
</P>
<P>
A: The law requires that your wife take the first minimum distribution from her 
IRA by April 1 of the year following the one in which she turned 70 1/2. Taxes 
are due by April 15 of the year following that in which the distribution is 
taken. So, your wife may indeed take her distribution by withdrawing all her 
funds from the account in February, 1990, and pay taxes on it by April 15, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
But will your wife be making further annual minimum withdrawals from her IRAs? 
If so, she will have to take the 1990 distribution by Dec. 31. It is only the 
initial withdrawal that may be delayed until April 1 of the following year. So 
if she has a second withdrawal to make, taxes on both distributions taken in 
1990 will due by April 15, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Heir Is Responsible for Taxes on Sale 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently inherited from my mother funds held in a double tax-free 
municipal bond fund and I immediately cashed out the account. Do I need to 
report all this to the IRS, and, if so, will I owe any taxes? I know my mother 
opened the account about two years ago, and I believe that the interest accrued 
on the account is not taxable, since it is a double tax-free account. But am I 
liable for any gains in the value of the holdings? Does it matter that my 
mother put my name on the account as well as her own? No estate tax was paid at 
the time of her death. -- B. P. W. 
</P>
<P>
A: Basically, you should figure that whenever you do just about anything with 
money, the tax man wants to know about it. In this case you must report the 
proceeds you received from the sale of the bond fund. Of course, interest 
generated by the fund is tax free. But if the fund has appreciated since you 
inherited it from your mother, you are liable for taxes on that increased 
value. This is true whether the inheritance is real property or a double 
tax-free municipal fund. 
</P>
<P>
You should calculate the appreciation by subtracting the value of the fund on 
the date your mother died from the fund's value when you disposed of it. If you 
sold it immediately after inheriting it, chances are your tax liability is 
quite small. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, just because your mother put your name on the account does not mean 
that you are liable for only half the taxes on any increase in the fund's value 
after your mother's death. The IRS says that a partial sharing of assets is not 
a gift until the assets are completely conveyed to the beneficiary.

DOW FALLS 22.83 ON JOBS REPORT, SOVIET WORRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stock prices declined Friday in the face of economic uncertainties and worries 
over political developments in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials fell 22.83 to 2,773.25, reducing its gain 
for the week to 20.05 points. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 591 up, 931 down and 453 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 158.53 million shares, down from 177 million in the 
previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, 
including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the 
over-the-counter market, totaled 191.73 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment rate held steady 
at 5.3% in December. The data showed a smaller-than-expected 142,000 increase 
in non-farm payroll employment. 
</P>
<P>
Traders in the bond market took that as favorable news, suggesting that the 
pace of the economy remained sluggish enough to allow the Federal Reserve to 
consider further moves toward easier credit. 
</P>
<P>
But stock market investors evidently read the figures as a sign that further 
weakness might be in store for corporate earnings in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts also said the market was unsettled by reports that Soviet leader 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev canceled foreign engagements to deal with domestic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Several European country funds gave up some of their recent gains on the chance 
that the Soviet situation might delay or disrupt new trade opportunities in 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Germany Fund fell 2 3/4 to 17, posting the day's biggest percentage loss among 
NYSE issues; Austria Fund was down 1 1/4 at 20 5/8, and Italy Fund lost 3/4 to 
15 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Malaysia Fund, by contrast, gained 1 3/4 to 21 7/8, and First Philippine Fund 
rose 7/8 to 14 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Regional telephone stocks sold off in a general flow of money out of the 
"defensive" issues that gained many followers in late 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Southwestern Bell dropped 3 to 59 1/4; Pacific Telesis fell 1 1/2 to 47 3/4; 
Bell South lost 1 7/8 to 55 5/8, and Nynex dipped 1 1/8 to 86 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Losers among other blue chips included General Electric, down 5/8 at 65 5/8; 
Merck, down 1 5/8 at 77; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down 3/4 at 44 
5/8, and McDonald's, down 5/8 at 33 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
International Business Machines, which had been rallying from depressed levels 
in recent sessions, slipped back 1/4 to 99 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
The reports that Gorbachev had canceled all January meetings sent the Tokyo 
share index tumbling as much as 622.37 points, but prices regained part of 
their losses by the close. The 225-share Nikkei index tumbled 438.12 points or 
1.13% to close at 38,274.76 after falling 202.99 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices finished slightly lower on London's stock exchange. The Financial 
Times 100-share index fell 7.1 points to close at 2,444.5. 
</P>
<P>
CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Bond Prices Tumble Over Inflation Fears 
</P>
<P>
Prices of long-term government bonds sank on new inflation fears and the Labor 
Department's report that apparently offered no hope of lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell 1/4 point, or $2.50 for every 
$1,000 in face value. Its yield rose to 8.06% from 8.03% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Shorter-term Treasury yields were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.125%, down from 8.215% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal 
bonds was 93 1/16, down 1/8. The average yield to maturity rose to 7.28% from 
7.27% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Gold Rises on Events in the Eastern Bloc 
</P>
<P>
The dollar staged a turnaround Friday, closing mostly higher in domestic 
dealings after taking a sharp hit in overseas markets that were focusing on 
events in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices soared by as much as $9 an ounce. On the Commodity Exchange in New 
York, gold bullion for current delivery jumped $7.70 to settle at $406.30 an 
ounce. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $406.25 
an ounce, up $7.50 from Thursday's late bid. 
</P>
<P>
The news reports that Gorbachev had canceled January appointments with foreign 
officials sparked the hike in gold prices and frightened currency markets 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
"So much depends on him keeping peace in the Eastern Bloc and to give enough 
room for progress to continue," said Jack Barbanel, managing director of First 
Global Managers in Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
While foreign markets focused on Gorbachev's political health, domestic traders 
keyed in on the Labor Department's unemployment report. The addition of 142,000 
non-farm jobs was weaker than expected. 
</P>
<P>
"The dollar dropped off rather sharply on the weak number," said Stephen 
Flanagan, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. The report gave 
further fuel to the argument that the U.S. economy is slowing and that the 
Federal Reserve might move to lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign appetite for dollars is dampened when the yields on U.S. securities 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
Traders also noted that the Fed entered the market to sell dollars for yen, 
pushing the dollar lower against the Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
A lower dollar will help ensure "we have some advantage in continuing the level 
of exports (to Japan)," which in turn aids in improving the trade deficit, 
Barbanel noted. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the negative news, technical factors pushed the dollar higher at the 
close of trading. 
</P>
<P>
"The volume was high, and trading was somewhat chaotic," Flanagan said. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 144.15 Japanese yen, from 145.20 yen on Thursday. 
Later in London, it fell to 143.75 yen. In New York, the dollar finished at 
144.50 yen, up from 143.65 yen on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound rose to $1.6375 from $1.6290 late Thursday. In New 
York, it cost $1.6350 to buy one pound, unchanged from Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $404.50 an ounce, from $395 bid late 
Thursday. In Zurich, Switzerland, the metal rose to a closing bid of $405.50, 
from $395.70 bid late Thursday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $6.03 to close 
at a bid $400.92. 
</P>
<P>
Silver prices rose. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery 
settled at $5.318 an ounce, from $5.268 an ounce on Thursday. In London, the 
metal rose to a late bid price of $5.27 an ounce, from $5.22 bid late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Heating Oil Futures Continue to Fall 
</P>
<P>
Heating oil futures prices plunged more than 5 cents a gallon for the second 
straight day on the New York Mercantile Exchange as warm temperatures in the 
Northeast flushed speculators from the market. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, orange juice futures rebounded strongly; precious 
metals were sharply higher; pork futures surged while cattle futures were 
mixed, and grains and soybeans were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Wholesale home heating oil futures settled 2.27 to 5.36 cents lower, with the 
contract for delivery in February at 67.83 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude oil finished 33 to 58 cents lower, with February 
at 23.08 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 2 to 3.07 cents lower, with 
February at 62.22 cents a gallon.

THE WORD 'CENSORSHIP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am offended by still another reference to the Christian response to "Piss 
Christ" as censorship ("Censorship: A Decade of Tighter Control of the Arts" by 
Allan Parachini and Dennis McDougal, Dec. 25). 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who cannot be offended has no soul. 
</P>
<P>
When so many other groups are so quick to take offense, why do you call our 
voice censorship? When someone sticks Christ's image in urine and titles it 
"Piss Christ" and then you call our protesting voices censorship, you are 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
When the Japanese-American community took offense at a work of art to be 
installed at MOCA you had no criticism. When Jewish pressure had Vanessa 
Redgrave canceled as a performer with the Boston Symphony you did not use the 
word censorship. When homosexual groups complained about the script for a 
popular TV show, the script was changed and not a word of condemnation was 
issued by The Times.

REMOVAL OF ROBERT TAYLOR'S NAME FROM A STUDIO BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerning the removal of Robert Taylor's name from a Lorimar Studios building

Taylor was following his beliefs when he testified before the House Committee 
on Un-American Activities. The fact that he was misguided about what was a 
danger to the country doesn't negate his contribution to the movie industry.

It appears that while Lorimar doesn't agree with Joe McCarthy's politics, it's 
willing to adopt his tactics.

REMOVAL OF ROBERT TAYLOR'S NAME FROM A STUDIO BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blowing Robert Taylor's name off his building at Lorimar and renaming it for 
George Cukor has its spiritual antecedent in the Soviet Union, when St. 
Petersburg became Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
Had Taylor named American Nazis and not Communists, our current but 
philosophically dated Hollywood cadre would be giving award dinners in his 
name.

FACES . . . : GOING FOR THE 'GLORY'

<TEXT>
<P>
Talk to British actor Cary Elwes about something he feels is not pertinent to 
his acting and a chilling transformation comes over the Prince Charming of 
"Princess Bride." The actor's perfect jawline clenches and his cool green eyes 
freeze over in a way that lets you know this dashingly handsome actor is tired 
of being known for being "dashingly handsome." He wants to be taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of mediocrity out there," he says. "Every actor gets deluged 
with it at some point. So I focus only on the film projects that interest me." 
</P>
<P>
In the current Civil War drama "Glory," Elwes plays a Union soldier who, along 
with a Boston Brahmin played by Matthew Broderick, is put in charge of the 
North's first regiment of blacks. The film provides a sweeping, violent look at 
the Civil War, with racist epithets being hurled among the canon fodder. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of scenes were taken from fact," says Elwes. "We wanted to show every 
aspect of the brutalities that these people suffered from their own side in the 
North." 
</P>
<P>
In his next film, Elwes co-stars with Tom Cruise in "Days of Thunder," a movie 
about stock car racers being shot this winter in the South. "Those guys have 
everything," Elwes says of the drivers. "Wives, children, success -- and in a 
fraction of a second they could lose it all." 
</P>
<P>
Elwes would not discuss the specifics of his role in "Days of Thunder," which 
was written by Robert Towne and is being directed by Tony Scott ("Top Gun"), 
but he was expansive about his experiences with "Glory." He speaks excitedly 
about the camaraderie between director Ed Zwick and the cast and crew during 
the long, cold filming of the battle scenes in southern Georgia, though he 
doesn't completely conceal his irritation over the scenes between him and 
Broderick that were trimmed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy with it," he says. "The film had a message, a plot that worked on 
many levels and it was well-written. For an actor, that's it." LANCE LOUD

LEWITZKY'S DECADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Notwithstanding limitations of space, both Lewis Segal's and Martin 
Bernheimer's Dec. 26 retrospectives on dance in the '80s made a serious 
omission. 
</P>
<P>
Bella Lewitzky's accomplishments in the '80s (20th company anniversary, 
acclaimed international premieres, etc.) are noteworthy for dance historians, 
but L.A.'s media particularly should recognize -- indeed, highlight her 
continued success these 10 years.

STORYTELLER SPINS WEB THAT CAPTURES THE LESSONS OF LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
"THE WONDER IS THAT THE CHARACTERISTIC EFFICACY TO TOUCH AND INSPIRE DEEP 
CREATIVE CENTERS DWELLS IN THE SMALLEST NURSERY FAIRY TALE -- AS THE FLAVOR OF 
THE OCEAN IS CONTAINED IN A DROPLET OR THE WHOLE MYSTERY OF LIFE IN THE EGG OF

<P>
The man struggling for life in the hospital's intensive-care unit made but one 
request. He wanted his friend, David Novak, to tell him a story. 
</P>
<P>
So Novak obliged, recounting the courage of a tiny spider who, against all 
odds, scaled a water spout after nearly drowning in a rainstorm. 
</P>
<P>
"Early one morning in Spider Town, before the sun came up, all was quiet and 
still," Novak began. "The cool dew was clinging to the sleepy spider webs, and 
not a web was stirring. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
For his ailing friend, the tale of the spider "was like a warm cup of tea on a 
cold night," said Novak, a professional storyteller. "It was an opportunity to 
hold his hand and let him know someone cared for him." 
</P>
<P>
His friend recovered, and, although Novak is reluctant to give himself credit, 
the episode "taught me the greatest respect for the story." 
</P>
<P>
Because his friend clung to life, the nursery rhyme "took on a great resonance 
and meaning. It became a real heroic journey," said Novak, his voice becoming 
hushed at the memory. 
</P>
<P>
Novak shares this and other tales with students throughout San Diego County. 
Through grants from the California Arts Council and the San Diego Institute for 
Arts Education, he teaches both teachers and students the joys of storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
Today and Sunday at 7:30 p.m., Novak will present his "Telling Experience" at 
the Big Kitchen Cafe. And he will perform with other members of the San Diego 
Storytellers on Jan. 10 at Drowsy Maggie's. Later this month, he will perform 
in Steamboat Springs, Colo., and in February will do 3 dozen performances in 
New York, New Jersey and Connecticut for the Lincoln Center Institute, the 
educational arm of the arts center. 
</P>
<P>
For audiences, his tales are "like a waking dream, a guided fantasy," said 
Novak, a tall man with blue eyes and a resonant voice. 
</P>
<P>
"Listening to myths and legends teaches us to think in metaphors and images and 
to apprehend things not only in a strictly verbal way. It helps us understand 
life on a larger scale. We can receive life and the lessons it has to offer." 
</P>
<P>
Anne Chase, program director for the San Diego Institute, called Novak's 
storytelling "exquisite. He's enormously popular with the children," she said, 
indicating that it's unusual to hire an artist three years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Storytelling can also improve language skills. 
</P>
<P>
"Before you read and write you have to speak," said Stephanie Ruin, a 
fourth-grade teacher at Rose Elementary School in Escondido. "You can see the 
beauty of it. It's not vocabulary and dry work sheets. It's an expression of 
oneself." 
</P>
<P>
During a recent performance at Rose, Novak demonstrated that theater's loss is 
storytelling's gain. He transformed himself into an array of characters as he 
related the story of Little Red Riding Hood -- from the cackling grandmother to 
the growling wolf to Little Red herself. The transformations were accomplished 
with the simple, clever use of a red bandanna tied around his head in various 
ways: under his chin for the grandmother, around his ears for Little Red and 
over his mouth for the wolf. At one dizzying point, he feverishly switched from 
wolf to Red as he chased her in a circle. 
</P>
<P>
Novak also created a cozy atmosphere by enlisting the students' help in 
building a "storyteller's fire." First, he invited listeners to throw him 
imaginary pieces of kindling, branches and logs. His arms sagged under the 
weight of the wood as he "caught" the pieces. He "lit" the wood and he and his 
audience began to snap their fingers as the fire sparked. Then Novak slapped 
his fist and clapped loudly, and the sounds of a happy crackling campfire 
filled the school auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes Elementary School Principal Jeannie Steeg has noticed that students 
become enthusiastic about reading once they hear Novak's tales. 
</P>
<P>
"If he tells a story that is part of a book, kids all of a sudden want to go 
out and get that book," she said. Said Rose Elementary fourth-grader Dan 
Claytor: "If I tell the stories to my mom, she can tell them to another kid who 
can tell his mom. It will spread around and keep going forever." 
</P>
<P>
Novak's storytelling skills were honed during his childhood in Ft. Lauderdale, 
Fla. One of four children, he began performing in a children's theater group in 
second grade. 
</P>
<P>
The play was "Aladdin's Wonderful Lamp." "I was a spear carrier, quite 
literally," said Novak, relaxing with a cup of tea in his comfortably cluttered 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother likes to tell the story of how we would visit friends and I wouldn't 
want to play with the kids. I would sit with the grown-ups and play Mr. Smith. 
It was just an alter ego." 
</P>
<P>
Novak was also an avid reader of books by Kenneth Grahame, who writes about 
"mythical childhood reminiscences." 
</P>
<P>
In high school, Novak started a mime troupe that performed at other schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We performed in a nudist colony once in nothing but white face," he said with 
a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Novak attended Broward College in Ft. Lauderdale and transferred to Southern 
Methodist University in Dallas. Because of his extensive theatrical experience, 
he was permitted to take graduate seminars. 
</P>
<P>
After his graduation in 1976 with a bachelor's degree in fine arts, he worked 
briefly for theaters in Wisconsin and Rhode Island before joining the St. Louis 
Theater Project Company. Among his roles was the lead in Hamlet. He also fell 
in love with and married Courtney Flanagan, a director there whom he had met in 
college. 
</P>
<P>
Part of his duties with the company included dressing like Paul Bunyan and 
spinning tall tales for schoolchildren. But Novak finally found his own voice 
at a St. Louis storytelling festival in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
There, he used an Ed Norton-like character to tell a Japanese story about a 
stonecutter who was unhappy with his lot. The stonecutter used a magic potion 
to transform himself into an emperor, the sun, a cloud and a mountain before he 
realized he liked being himself best of all. 
</P>
<P>
"I had an audience of 300 people and I made it up as I went along," Novak said. 
"It was a real 'aha' experience. I suddenly discovered after all these years 
that I had been involved in useless yet fervent productivity." Finally, he 
said, "I felt a centered-ness, a harmony." 
</P>
<P>
The story became a metaphor for his eventual realization that storytelling was 
his true calling. 
</P>
<P>
Novak moved here to attend graduate school and earned a master's degree in fine 
arts from UC San Diego in 1986. For the next two years, he endured a dizzying 
schedule of acting engagements from Alaska to Utah, fitting in storytelling 
performances with the San Diego Institute for Arts Education and the Lincoln 
Center Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Novak flew to New York several times to audition for plays. His agent begged 
him to move to the Big Apple and forget his storytelling aspirations. "You 
should do theater and TV," he was told. "You should be doing soap commercials." 
</P>
<P>
The uncertain life style was wearing him down. "You would be waiting by the 
telephone to take a job at a moment's notice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The final straw was a six-month stint at the Berkeley Shakespeare Festival in 
1988. Even after snaring such plum roles as Troilus in "Troilus and Cressida," 
he had "no notion of a future," Novak said. He also found separations from his 
family difficult. 
</P>
<P>
The lure of storytelling was beckoning. "I missed the autonomy, I missed the 
creativity and I missed the pleasure of it." 
</P>
<P>
Novak finally realized his true vocation. "With theater, I banged my head 
against walls, but with storytelling, doors opened that shouldn't have. Double 
locks were unlocked and people invited me in. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally admitted to myself that performing for children was OK," he said. 
"It's not second-best. It's a real legitimate community which needs someone to 
address its interests." 
</P>
<P>
Storytelling also affords him the luxury of planning a schedule, sometimes as 
much as two years in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Novak embroiders his stories from myth, fable and folklore. Stories also spring 
from his own experiences. And sometimes headlines spark stories. "Waiting for 
Recess" is a childs-eye retelling of the Stockton schoolyard massacre. 
</P>
<P>
The best rehearsals are done in his mind. Sometimes, a story must percolate 
through his brain for years before it is ready to be told, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Often, he weaves his story from a series of images. In the spider tale, the 
images were vivid. Novak described in an ominous voice how "the mouth of the 
spout rose up before him like a great dark cave. He could hear the wind 
whirring inside." He told of "dark thunderclouds swelling up like sponges, 
getting ready to soak the land." And after the rain, "water from the puddles 
began to steam up into the sky." 
</P>
<P>
Even in conversation, his descriptions are often lyrical. He described a 
theater in St. Louis as "an old ghostly edifice in the middle of a withering 
downtown." 
</P>
<P>
Novak likes to bring his only child, 2-year-old son, Jack, to performances. "I 
want to have time with him and not have a separate work world," he said, 
changing a diaper after a performance. "A child brings ecstasy, joy and an 
unbearable promise of loss." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Novak began weaving string images to use as illustrations for his 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
The string once helped to unlock the memories of a timid Asian girl. Novak had 
asked students in a fourth-grade classroom to create their own image from 
string. 
</P>
<P>
"She made the side of a boat and said, 'I'm feeling sick.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Are there other people in the boat with you?" Novak asked, then invited other 
students to join her. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out she was from Vietnam and she was one of the boat people. She was 
rescued as the boat was sinking. It made a really deep impression on me," Novak 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Novak recently found his life taking on a story-like quality of its own when 
his Australian shepherd, Gigi, bit a neighbor. The incident aroused his own 
feelings that somehow he wasn't quite worthy of home ownership after leaving 
behind a bohemian existence. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great embarrassment to me and a source of constant chagrin," Novak 
said. "I imagined the other houses glaring at us and wondered whether they had 
made up their minds to approve of us." 
</P>
<P>
As for the dog bite: "If this were a story, then the hero would have to face 
the music. So I prepared for the worst, I prepared to be humbled and make my 
peace with it. It turned out they were the sweetest couple, and it turned into 
a happy ending." 
</P>
<P>
Novak was then reminded of a Pima legend about the first human, who placed his 
hand over his heart and drew out a large stick. 
</P>
<P>
"He used this stick from his heart to find his way in the dark, and, when he 
was weary, he rested on it. 
</P>
<P>
"For me," Novak said, "stories are sticks from the heart."

CALLA LILY: RHIZOME WITH WHITE FLOWERS THAT BLOOM IN WINTER AND SPRING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Calla lilies are undeniably, unavoidably elegant. The smooth, velvety "petal" 
(it's really a spathe or bract) is a thin tube coming out of the stem, then 
flaring out around the golden central spike, which is covered with many tiny 
flowers that look more like coarse pollen than real blooms. It is one of the 
simplest and classiest flowers around -- and one of the easiest to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Books tell us, in no uncertain terms, that callas need plenty of water, lots of 
light except in hot afternoons and no frost. At least two of those three are 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
My Echo Park callas were in the front yard when I moved in, so I can claim no 
credit for their choice or placement. They were planted along the shady north 
wall of the garage in a yard that was otherwise devoted to drought-tolerant 
plants, such as agaves and aloes. Insufficient sun, completely inadequate 
water, according to the books. But 15 years later, those callas are alive and 
well. 
</P>
<P>
I never dug them up, never fed them, rarely watered them. They are mulched 
every summer; that is the limit of my care. These callas are slightly smaller 
than a well-tended version, only about 3-feet high instead of 4, and they have 
moved away from the garage about 2 or 3 feet (no doubt following the light), 
but they are otherwise healthy and gorgeous. 
</P>
<P>
So don't hesitate; buy these rhizomes when and where you can find them, and 
plant them this spring (or next fall). 
</P>
<P>
Frank Burkard of Burkard Nurseries in Pasadena says he will have his best 
selection of callas in February. Zantedeschia aethiopica is the common white 
variety, but callas are also available in pinks and yellows, some with unusual 
spotted foliage. 
</P>
<P>
A red species, Zantedeschia rehmannii, is now available, but its purple variety 
is harder to find. "Green Goddess," a recent calla introduction that is, true 
to its name, green-flowered, is now available in rhizomes and not just as 
container plants. 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand callas are increasingly popular because of their size and color 
range (including bicolors). Burkard suggests customers with a specific type of 
calla in mind call ahead to make sure the plants have come in. 
</P>
<P>
Park Seed Co., Cokesbury Road, Greenwood, S.C. 29647-0001, offers rhizomes of 
several species and varieties of calla lilies, including a bright red beauty 
with spotted leaves called Flame. Calla seeds are available from Park in 
Zantedeschia aethiopica "Giant White," Z. albomaculata and Z. rehmannii 
"Superba." JUDITH SIMS

For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen: 
</P>
<P>
* Check out the ornamental cousins of two winter vegetables by asking for 
flowering kale or cabbage. 
</P>
<P>
Their intensely colored rosettes will brighten winter flower beds. 
</P>
<P>
* Look up two popular flowering shrubs in the garden center: azaleas and 
camellias. 
</P>
<P>
* Put in your first planting of gladiolus this month and follow it up with 
additional plantings at 15-day intervals to extend their blooming period. 
</P>
<P>
* For a delightful ground cover in the shadier part of your lawn, don't forget 
to plant forget-me-nots.

FRUIT-TREE PRUNING MEANS LESS IS MORE; 
</P>
<P>
GARDENING: PROPER TRIMMING IS NECESSARY TO INSURE FULL PRODUCTION FROM FRUITING 
TREES.

The most important job in proper fruit-tree care -- except for the basics of 
watering and feeding -- is pruning, says Jim Barry, certified arborist and 
horticulture instructor at Cal Poly Pomona. It is also the most difficult job 
to learn to do properly. 
</P>
<P>
We are talking about mature deciduous fruit trees, not citrus trees. Citrus 
trees require only occasional pruning to remove deadwood, to shape and to open 
up the interior of the tree. 
</P>
<P>
By deciduous fruit trees, we're referring to peach, plum, nectarine, apple, 
pear, persimmon, almond and a few others. All except apple and persimmon trees 
should be pruned yearly to rejuvenate the fruiting wood (parts of branches that 
bear the fruit). Pruning is done while trees are dormant -- anywhere from late 
December through the middle of February. This is the key to decent fruit 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Because the main goal of pruning is to renew fruiting wood, a gardener must be 
able to locate and identify the wood on each type of tree. For instance, 
peaches are produced on last year's wood, while apricot and plums are produced 
on 2- or 3-year-old wood. 
</P>
<P>
The pruning of fruit trees is difficult to learn because they are all 
approached differently. You don't prune a peach like a plum, or an apple like 
an apricot. 
</P>
<P>
By far the best way to learn to prune is to attend a demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Barry said attendance at the demonstrations will also help gardeners with the 
secondary goals of fruit-tree pruning -- controlling the height and shape of 
the tree and removing dead, diseased or surplus branches. 
</P>
<P>
Two fruit-tree-pruning demonstrations are taking place in the Southland this 
month. They are quite popular, so get there early. 
</P>
<P>
The first of these demonstrations will be Jan. 14 at South Coast Botanic 
Garden, 26300 Crenshaw Blvd., Palos Verdes Peninsula; phone (213) 772-5813. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration, scheduled for 2 p.m. in the auditorium, will be led by Jean 
Natter, a horticulture instructor at Cerritos College and a garden columnist. 
</P>
<P>
The pruning demonstration will be held in an auditorium rather than out among 
the trees because last year's demonstration was so popular that the area around 
the trees was crowded. Many people complained that they couldn't see or hear 
the demonstrators properly. 
</P>
<P>
Natter's demonstration will include a lecture, diagrams and slides. She will 
offer pruning techniques for apricot, peach, nectarine, plum, apple and almond 
trees. Although the pruning of citrus is not a crucial item, Natter will cover 
the topic because it has been so popular at past demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
After the demonstration will be a question-and-answer session. The 
demonstration is free; however, there is a charge to get into the South Coast 
Botanic Garden. 
</P>
<P>
The second demonstration, the one in which Jim Barry is involved, will be Jan. 
20 from 1 to 3 p.m. at the Fullerton Arboretum. The arboretum is at the 
northeast corner of the Cal State Fullerton campus, at Yorba Linda and 
Associated Road in Fullerton; phone (714) 773-3579. Admission is free, but 
donations to the arboretum are appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
Barry's demonstration is more "hands on," utilizing the extensive fruit tree 
orchard on the grounds. It will feature Barry; Dr. Alden Kelley, a certified 
arborist; Rico Montenegro, associate director of the arboretum, and various 
tree experts from the Tree Society of Orange County. The demonstration is 
co-sponsored by the arboretum and the society. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration will open with a presentation on fruit-tree-pruning 
fundamentals. The audience will be divided into small groups for the actual 
tree-pruning demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Because the arboretum has a nice selection of the various deciduous trees, 
spectators will get a good look at the particular trees they are interested in 
pruning. 
</P>
<P>
If you are unable to attend one of these demonstrations, Barry said the next 
best thing for learning proper pruning techniques is a good book. 
</P>
<P>
He likes "Pruning, A How-to Guide for Gardeners" from HP Books, and a small, 
locally produced book titled "How to Prune Fruit Trees" by Sanford Martin. Both 
should be available at Southland nurseries.

Harold (Doc) Edgerton, whose development of the electronic flash showed 
humankind brilliant images of a world never before seen, died of a heart attack 
Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Edgerton, 86, whose work was familiar to millions through stop-action 
photographs of such images as the wings of a hummingbird in flight or of a 
bullet shattering a balloon, died while having lunch at the faculty club of the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was professor emeritus of electrical 
measurements at the school. 
</P>
<P>
The achievements of Edgerton, a much loved professor dubbed "Papa Flash," 
spanned much of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
As a boy he learned photography from an uncle but grew frustrated when his 
first roll of indoor pictures was underexposed. After receiving a degree in 
electrical engineering from the University of Nebraska he entered MIT, where he 
earned a doctorate in 1931. 
</P>
<P>
It was while a graduate student that he built his first flash tube using 
vaporized mercury. He later turned to the xenon gas still in use today. (The 
concept itself dates to the 19th Century, and electric-spark photographs were 
done at the beginning of this century.) 
</P>
<P>
Edgerton succeeded in making exposures of less than one microsecond's duration. 
(A microsecond is one-millionth of a second.) And the process was repeatable. 
</P>
<P>
Edgerton's revolutionary work in the use of strobe lights captured images long 
hidden to the naked eye. His famous photographs of a drop of milk splashing on 
a table top and of a bullet shooting through apples and balloons showed the 
world what time looks like when it stands still. 
</P>
<P>
Edgerton's strobe work also led to underwater exploration. He helped search the 
Aegean Sea for the mythical city of Atlantis and surveyed Loch Ness in an 
attempt to solve the mystery of the Scottish monster. In 1973 he helped find 
the remains of the Civil War ironclad Monitor, which had sunk off Cape 
Hatteras, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
His strobe lamps enabled the Allies to track enemy movements at night during 
World War II and were used to photograph the first atomic tests. He once 
photographed a football player kicking a ball, showing the ball compressed 
almost in half at the moment of impact. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, he was awarded a national medal of technology by then-President 
Reagan. Undersea explorer Jacques Cousteau used some of Edgerton's sonar 
equipment, and the two collaborated in locating the British Army ship HMS 
Britannia, which was sunk by a mine off the Greek coast during World War I. 
Edgerton's influence even penetrated to the depths of the Titanic. His 
underwater camera was used to photograph the shipwreck when it was discovered 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"If it comes, it comes," Edgerton once said of his ideas and inventions. "It'll 
come by inspiration and God almighty and hit you right in the middle of the 
night." 
</P>
<P>
Although officially retired from MIT in 1968, he continued to live in an 
apartment next to the campus and most days could still be found in his 
laboratory just off MIT's "Strobe Alley," where his work is displayed. 
</P>
<P>
"I got stuck," he once said of his long affiliation with the university. "But 
it's given me a very nice place to work." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his inventions, Edgerton and two former students started a 
company called EG&amp;G in 1947, specializing in electronic technology. Now a 
multimillion-dollar engineering concern, the company was under contract to the 
military and designed and operated systems that timed and fired U.S. nuclear 
bomb tests. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting of the Archaeological Society of America, Edgerton offered 
words of advice to a group gathered to honor his life's achievements. 
</P>
<P>
"Work like hell, tell everyone everything you know, close a deal with a 
handshake, and have fun," Edgerton told the society's members. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of 62 years, Esther, a daughter and a son.

Bishop J. O. (James Oglethorpe) Patterson Sr., presiding bishop since 1968 of 
the Church of God in Christ, the largest black Pentecostal denomination in the 
United States, has died here after an eight-month bout with cancer. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Patterson was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer but refused therapy, 
saying he was open to God's healing and God's will. He died Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Under Patterson, the church outgrew all other Pentecostal churches. In 1982, it 
had 3.7 million members, 10 times as many as it had in 1961 when founder and 
Bishop Charles Harrison Mason died. 
</P>
<P>
The Church of God in Christ is an offshoot of the tongues-speaking Pentecostal 
revival of 1906 at the Azusa Street Mission in Los Angeles. Patterson was the 
son-in-law of Mason, a one-time Baptist preacher who gave the denomination its 
Pentecostal characteristics after visiting Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The denomination has about 10,000 local churches but has shed its "storefront" 
image in recent years. Many of its churches have upward of 1,000 members.

HARRIS SEEKS TO HAVE SENTENCE OVERTURNED; 
</P>
<P>
DEATH PENALTY: THE KILLER OF TWO SAN DIEGO TEEN-AGERS HAS SEEN HIS CASE 
PROGRESS FURTHER TOWARD EXECUTION THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER CONVICT ON 
CALIFORNIA'S DEATH ROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a legal brief filed Friday, Robert Alton Harris has urged the California 
Supreme Court to overturn his death sentence, arguing that he has changed for 
the better in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to put off California's first execution since 1967, Harris, convicted of 
the murders of two San Diego teen-age boys, said it would be cruel and unusual 
punishment to kill him now that he has changed. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, whose case has progressed further through the court system than that of 
any of the more than 200 men on California's Death Row, also contended that the 
lengthy delay since he was condemned to die -- nearing 11 years -- has violated 
his rights and warrants a new sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from those two claims, the nine other reasons detailed in the 180-page 
brief were mostly technical requests for relief, Harris' lead attorney, Charles 
Sevilla of San Diego, said Friday. A few, however, were responses to the denial 
last September by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco of the 
earlier appeal Harris had filed, Sevilla said. 
</P>
<P>
If all of Harris' appeals are rejected, some death penalty experts have said 
there is a chance he could be die in San Quentin's gas chamber by the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to consider this month whether to hear 
Harris' earlier appeal, Sevilla said. However, the brief filed Friday will 
begin yet another round of appeals for Harris, as the case works its way 
through the state and federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court already has upheld key parts of Harris' 1979 trial, 
making it unlikely that the court will review his case, prosecutors have said. 
The California Supreme Court, meanwhile, affirmed Harris' death sentence about 
10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Harris was arrested July 5, 1978, by San Diego Police Officer Steve Baker, who 
did not know that earlier in the day Harris had killed Baker's son, Michael, 
and Michael's friend, John Mayeski. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old boys had been eating their lunches in the parking lot of a 
Jack-in-the-Box in northern San Diego when Harris kidnaped them at gunpoint in 
a scheme to steal their car and use it in a bank robbery. 
</P>
<P>
He ordered them to drive to a canyon near Miramar Reservoir, where he killed 
them. Later, he ate their lunch. 
</P>
<P>
In the brief filed Friday, Harris argued that it violates his rights to kill 
him now that he has become what one regular visitor called an "affable, 
extremely friendly and obviously well-liked" prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
Harris included in the brief 21 sworn statements from friends, other inmates 
and even guards at San Quentin saying he has mellowed in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other reasons Harris said he should not be put to death is "newly 
discovered" evidence of "mental disorders" that Harris claimed have affected 
him but he did not know about when he was sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
The four "disorders" -- including a claim of post-traumatic stress disorder 
that does not involve military service -- obviously weren't presented at the 
trial and require neurological attention, Harris contended. 
</P>
<P>
Sevilla filed the brief Friday with an intermediate state appeal court in San 
Diego.

ATTACKS ON MIGRANTS HEIGHTEN TENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All Candido Salas wanted was a cup of coffee before he showed up at his usual 
Carlsbad street corner for another day of looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
But, when the 26-year-old migrant worker stepped inside the Country Grocery 
Store on El Camino Real this week, all he found was terror and humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, Salas was kidnaped for several hours by the store owners 
-- singled out to deliver a forceful message that the presence of local migrant 
workers was no longer appreciated at the rural market. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 8 a.m. Wednesday, Salas was grabbed by Randy Alfred Ryberg and 
beaten repeatedly while handcuffed to a railing in a rear delivery area outside 
the market, Carlsbad police said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, along with his brother Rickey Joe, police said, Randy Ryberg -- 6 feet 6 
inches tall and weighing 220 pounds -- bound the migrant laborer's arms and 
legs with duct tape. 
</P>
<P>
Before Salas was released to hobble into a nearby field, a paper bag was 
fastened over his head. The bag was painted with a face and a simple Spanish 
phrase. 
</P>
<P>
The message: "No Mas Aqui," ungrammatical Spanish for "Don't Come Back," 
according to Carlsbad Police Detective Richard Castaneda. 
</P>
<P>
The Ryberg brothers were arrested a short time later on a host of charges that 
included kidnaping, false imprisonment, battery and civil rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
The incident is among a new series of attacks on migrant laborers that were 
being investigated Friday by North County law enforcement agencies, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County Sheriff's Department is searching for two Anglo men 
believed to be responsible for a string of armed robberies and attacks in 
migrant camps in the Fallbrook area during the past three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Pablo Adrellano was shot once in the chest with a rifle after he 
resisted the men, who had robbed several other groups of migrants nearby. He 
was listed in fair condition Friday night at a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"He was shot because he said he didn't want to give them his money," said Lt. 
Bill Flores of the Fallbrook sheriff's substation. "He didn't offer any 
physical resistance, though." 
</P>
<P>
The pair also are suspects in the beating and robbery of a Bonsall migrant, 
Flores said. They are described as young men, in their early 20s, wearing Army 
fatigues, one with collar-length hair, the other closely cropped. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they are sought for questioning in at least two other robberies in 
migrant camps that have netted nearly $2,000 in cash, he said. The men 
reportedly drive a white pickup truck to the area, then walk from camp to camp 
robbing migrants. 
</P>
<P>
"This stuff is not unusual with the migrant camps we have in the area," Flores 
said. "These laborers usually have cash, and they're very reluctant to report a 
crime because they're afraid of being deported. 
</P>
<P>
"They make the perfect victims." 
</P>
<P>
Rise in Crimes 
</P>
<P>
Many robberies of migrants are committed by bands of illegal aliens from 
Tijuana who swoop into the camps after payday, he said. But authorities have 
also seen a rise in such crimes by Anglos -- including a Texas drifter who last 
month was sentenced to three years' imprisonment for a string of migrant camp 
holdups, Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
But authorities Friday were quick to downplay either the Carlsbad kidnaping or 
the Fallbrook robberies as "hate crimes." 
</P>
<P>
"The way they dress, these guys could be part of the KKK or the skinheads, but 
we're not investigating these incidents as hate crimes at the moment," Flores 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't leave behind any swastikas, they didn't scar anyone or tell them 
to get the hell out of the country. So right now, we're looking at them 
strictly as robbers and gunmen." 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad Detective Sergeant Bill Huntington said the Rybergs' store continually 
had been victimized by shoplifters and the brothers told police they were 
afraid the migrant presence outside the store was scaring away customers. On 
numerous occasions, police said, they had been called to the store by the 
brothers, who complained about the thefts and men drinking liquor outside the 
store. 
</P>
<P>
"They were frustrated, pure and simple, but I don't think this has any racist 
overtones," he said. "This thing is a two-way street. A businessman loses 
thousands of dollars a year to shoplifters, people scaring away his good 
customers." 
</P>
<P>
However, Huntington said, police believe that Salas was not going into the 
store to shoplift and that he simply wanted a cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not taking any sides in this, although I know Rick personally. What he did 
was wrong. But I can also see the frustration." 
</P>
<P>
But migrant advocates say the Carlsbad attack has all the makings of a racially 
motivated crime. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure you wouldn't see these two thugs try this type of thing if they 
thought some white kids were shoplifting in their store," said Roberto 
Martinez, director of the U.S.-Mexican Border Program for the American Friends 
Service Committee, an immigrant rights group. 
</P>
<P>
"They sent a clear message to the migrants, and they did it in a racist way. 
It's something you used to see in the Deep South, people playing judge, jury 
and executioner all at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the way the Klan works. You send someone a message by lynching them. It's 
the same mentality." 
</P>
<P>
Keeping Records 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said he has documented 10 years of racial attacks in San Diego County 
for his organization, including at least 14 assaults and killings of documented 
and undocumented workers by "white gangs and self-proclaimed supremacists." 
</P>
<P>
The cases include a November, 1988, incident in which two migrants were shot 
dead as they walked along a rural stretch of Black Mountain Road in North City 
West. Two San Diego teen-agers since have been arrested. One has plead guilty, 
and the other is awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
"This is typical of what we're seeing all over North County," he said. "And 
it's spreading. There's a lot of copycat gangs at work. They feel that these 
people don't have any rights in this country, so they can get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
For years, migrant laborers from Mexico and Central America have been pouring 
into North County, working day jobs in construction and agriculture, while 
living in makeshift encampments in the rustic arroyos and canyons throughout 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Smith, a lawyer for California Rural Legal Assistance, another migrant 
advocacy group, said that civil action may be taken in the Carlsbad kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
"My reaction to this is revulsion and, unfortunately, not one of surprise," she 
said. "It reflects the ambivalence that exists in the North County towards 
these people. 
</P>
<P>
"They subsidize a relatively affluent life style. People want them to work for 
them, but they don't want to see them. It's like they're saying, 'Get out of 
town by sundown. But be sure to come back by dawn. And bring along a few 
friends while you're at it.' 
</P>
<P>
"That's the message these (Anglos) are sending. But these people have got to 
learn they can't have it both ways." 
</P>
<P>
History of Tension 
</P>
<P>
Migrant advocates said there has been a history of racial tension at the 
Carlsbad market, known to passing motorists by the smiling, 12-foot fiberglass 
chicken perched on its roof. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a long history of harassment at this store," said the Rev. Rafael 
Martinez, director of the North County Chaplaincy in Encinitas. "The owner is a 
big guy. And he continually insults the workers who come into his store. 
</P>
<P>
"And, if they stand outside to drink their coffee, he goes outside and pushes 
them around. He's a bully." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said he was asked by the property owner from whom Rickey Ryberg rents 
to visit the store in an attempt to mitigate the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The workers said they couldn't boycott the store because it was the only one 
around," he said. "But, when they arranged for a catering truck to come to the 
lot, the store owner kicked the driver off. I'm terrified that these people are 
getting so bold." 
</P>
<P>
Contacted at his brother's grocery, where he works as a baker, Randy Ryberg 
said Friday that he and Rickey had been released on $22,500 and $22,100 bonds, 
respectively, but that neither had to put up any money for their release. 
</P>
<P>
"They let us go without putting up any cash because of our good standing in the 
community," he said, adding that they are scheduled for a Jan. 25 arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
Ryberg, 36, refused to comment on the details of the case, but denied that he 
and his brother dislike Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not racists," he said. "We've got nothing against these people." 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Eisley, who works in a nursery next to the store, said, however, that the 
migrants' presence has been a constant worry for the brothers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a point of contention every time we get together, which is every day, in 
fact," he said. "They're frustrated. They don't know what to do about it." 
</P>
<P>
Eisley said there have been many break-ins at the nursery and migrants have 
posed a shoplifting problem at the grocery store. "I think, if Rickey could get 
out of his lease, he would," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"After this, I'm sure he'll just close up the shop altogether." 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad Detective Castaneda said Salas had gone into the store, but ran out 
before he bought his coffee because he saw a possible employer pull up to the 
curb. 
</P>
<P>
Then, according to police, Randy Ryberg, who was standing in the front of the 
store, grabbed Salas, possibly thinking the laborer was running out with goods. 
He allegedly dragged Salas, who speaks no English, to the rear of the store, 
leaving him handcuffed until store owner Rickey Ryberg arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Salas, a native of Oaxaca, Mexico, who has been in the United States for less 
than nine months, was terrified by the kidnaping, which police said lasted 
about three hours. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't know what was happening," Castaneda said. 
</P>
<P>
"When they let him go, he couldn't see because of the bag they had over his 
head. He just staggered out into the field." 
</P>
<P>
A passer-by called authorities, and Salas was untied by an officer. Randy 
Ryberg was arrested at the store, police said. Rickey Ryberg, 37, turned 
himself into authorities a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently," Castaneda said, "these were two really frustrated people."

TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES: EX-SPOKESMEN RECALL BOTH; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE MERITS OF LYING WERE AMONG THE TOPICS DISCUSSED BY 10 
PRESIDENTIAL PRESS SECRETARIES DURING A FORUM AT UCSD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The question is one that inevitably confronts all White House press 
secretaries: What do you do, as NBC news commentator John Chancellor delicately 
put it Friday to 10 men who have held the job, when circumstances -- be they 
national security or simply presidential preference -- demand that you "shade 
the truth"? 
</P>
<P>
"I lied," shot back Jody Powell, former President Carter's press secretary. 
"And worse than that, I don't have any regrets about it." 
</P>
<P>
As was made clear at the opening session of a two-day symposium at UC San Diego 
that features an unprecedented gathering of White House press secretaries from 
six past administrations, Powell was not the only presidential spokesman who 
occasionally opted for loyalty to his boss over fidelity to the truth. 
</P>
<P>
Blending colorful White House press room war stories with insightful theories 
forged from experience, the men, who served presidents from John Kennedy 
through Ronald Reagan, delighted a crowd of about 500 with recollections of the 
times they bent, if not broke, the truth and insider tales of their successful 
-- and failed -- attempts at image management. Moderated by Chancellor, the 2 
1/2-hour program was broadcast in San Diego Friday night and is scheduled to be 
aired nationwide on public television this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the press secretaries conceded that the parameters of their 
high-visibility, high-pressure job were shaped largely by the personalities and 
policies of the presidents they served. Forced to mold with the clay at their 
disposal, the press secretaries, recognizing the futility of attempting a total 
remake of their bosses' images, said they were instead guided daily by a more 
modest though no less significant public-relations goal: consistently 
accentuating the positive while trying to minimize the negative. 
</P>
<P>
Often, those efforts had humorous overtones. For example, President Ford's 
advisers, sensitive over his reputation for klutziness, permitted no photos of 
the President with the national turkey at Thanksgiving -- "for obvious 
reasons," his press secretary, Ron Nessen, wryly noted. 
</P>
<P>
President Nixon's aides received a lesson in the potential pitfalls of image 
shaping when they decided that photos of him strolling along the beach at San 
Clemente would help soften his rigid, imperial image. That plan, however, 
backfired when the resulting pictures showed Nixon walking in the sand in his 
black Bostonian shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"That was our last attempt to deal with that situation," Nixon press secretary 
Ron Ziegler said, amid loud laughter. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the former White House spokesmen acknowledged that they occasionally 
misled the press -- and, consequently, the public -- either intentionally or 
inadvertently. Frequently, such deceptions were spawned by national security 
considerations, as when Powell denied to a reporter that the Carter 
Administration was planning the ultimately unsuccessful "Desert One" rescue 
attempt of the Iranian hostages, even though he knew that such plans were in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
George Reedy, one of Lyndon Johnson's three White House spokesmen, pointed out 
that the Administration consistently denied having U.S. bases in Thailand 
during the Vietnam War -- even though the bases' existence was common knowledge 
in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a secret for anybody except the American people who footed the 
bill," Reedy said. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan spokesman Larry Speakes also misled reporters about another military 
operation -- the planned invasion of Grenada -- but only because he himself had 
been misled by a Reagan national security adviser, who told him that the idea 
was "preposterous." The invasion occurred the day after Speakes passed along 
that denial to the press. 
</P>
<P>
"That taught me that, if you ask, 'Are we going to invade Grenada today?' and 
they say, 'No,' don't forget about tomorrow morning," Speakes said. 
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, however, Speakes was the architect of one of the 
best-known examples of deception by a presidential press secretary in recent 
history, when he admitted that he fabricated quotes that he attributed to 
Reagan when the President met Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev for the first 
time. His motivation, Speakes explained, was his concern that Reagan, who, on 
the advice of his staff, sat silent while photographers snapped photos of the 
two leaders, might be eclipsed by Gorbachev's expansive remarks to reporters. 
Hoping to capture the historic tenor of the summit, Speakes told reporters that 
Reagan had said, "The world rests easier because we're meeting here today." 
</P>
<P>
"It retrospect, it was the wrong thing to do," Speakes said, even while noting 
that speeches and comments written by others frequently are attributed to the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
Prefers Honesty 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy press secretary Pierre Salinger suggested that, rather than lie to the 
press, it is better to be honest and then, if necessary, appeal to reporters or 
editors to withhold information that could jeopardize lives or American 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
He successfully used that approach, he said, shortly after Kennedy became 
President when Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev privately offered to release 
several downed U.S. pilots -- but made it clear that any premature publicity 
would kill the deal. When confronted by a reporter, Salinger confirmed the 
details -- but won his assurance that the story would be held until the pilots 
were freed. 
</P>
<P>
If national security defines one end point of the spectrum in the explanations 
for White House press secretarial deceptions, the other end is marked by what 
Nessen described simply as "silly reasons." When Ford wanted to go to Florida 
primarily to play golf, for example, his aides had to "drum up a community 
meeting" as justification for the trip, Nessen said. 
</P>
<P>
When the press begins to focus on such stories -- usually inconsequential in 
substance, but deadly serious in terms of the public perceptions they foster or 
reinforce -- that often is indicative of deeper problems surrounding a 
presidency, the press secretaries agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the consensus Friday was that, aso long as domestic pocketbook issues 
and world affairs are in good shape, presidents are less likely to encounter -- 
and certainly are better equipped to weather -- press sniping about bumping 
their heads on helicopter doors or the like. Stories about Reagan's frequent 
factual inaccuracies at news conferences and hands-off management style became 
less common, they pointed out, when the recession that dominated his first 
several years in office receded. 
</P>
<P>
However, when growing problems cause a president's popularity to plummet, 
stories that could be shrugged off -- or might not even be reported otherwise 
-- begin to take hold, they said. Just as the Vietnam War eroded Johnson's 
credibility and increasingly made him fodder for the nation's stand-up comics, 
Watergate did the same for Nixon, while high inflation and the Iranian hostage 
dilemma undercut Carter's support. Amid such distractions, it becomes more 
difficult for a president to refocus the nation's attention on his agenda, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to be selecting patterns for next year's outfits when your pants are 
on fire," Carter spokesman Powell said. Indeed, the now-familiar story about 
Carter allegedly being attacked by a "killer rabbit" in the late 1970s 
reinforced skepticism about a president who had been seen by many as a bit 
quirky from the start. 
</P>
<P>
Human Elements 
</P>
<P>
Much of Friday's program was enlivened by the recitation of personal anecdotes 
that shed light on the human elements of being the spokesman for the most 
powerful office in the world -- stories alternately told with the 
matter-of-fact casualness of the insider's insider, or in a somewhat breathless 
now-it-can-be-told manner. 
</P>
<P>
Salinger told of the time, for example, when he mentioned to Kennedy that the 
White House was receiving complaints from women because most photos of the 
First Couple showed the President walking in front of his wife. "Tell Jackie to 
walk faster," was Kennedy's solution. 
</P>
<P>
James Brady, who was seriously wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on 
Reagan, joked about how Henry Kissinger tried to persuade Reagan that a few 
minor constitutional adjustments could easily produce a monarchy in this 
country -- with Kissinger as foreign minister. 
</P>
<P>
Technological advancements that make instantaneous worldwide communication 
possible, coupled with a growing tendency to view the President as, in 
Chancellor's words, "the be all and end all" of virtually all news, have 
confronted recent press secretaries with new challenges. 
</P>
<P>
The incessant demands for the President's response to any and all world events 
also is one of the primary differences between the presidential press 
secretaries' job and that of a typical public-relations officer. Although the 
latter can carefully limit his client's public comments, a White House press 
secretary does not have that luxury. Underlining that point, Chancellor noted 
that, when Pope John Paul II was shot, medical bulletins on his condition were 
released from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
But the press, too, has contributed to the perception of the White House as a 
kind of worldwide information vortex, the press secretaries said. As Ford 
spokesman Nessen stressed, TV reporters are more likely to be videotaped in 
front of the White House than the Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
"An explosion of journalism in this century has tipped the scales against the 
President," Johnson spokesman Bill Moyers said. 
</P>
<P>
High Marks for Bush 
</P>
<P>
Most of the participants in Friday's symposium gave high marks to President 
Bush's relationship with the press. In particular, they credited him with, in 
Salinger's words, "eliminating shouting journalism" by granting reporters 
dramatically greater access than they had to Reagan -- whose contact with the 
press often was limited to reporters' questions yelled over the noise of the 
rotor blades of the presidential helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
In reviewing how the presidential press secretary's job has evolved over the 
past three decades, most of the former White House spokesmen argued, if not for 
a greater policy role for the press secretary, at least for enhanced access to 
policy-making discussions. Some of the major public-relations disasters faced 
by each during his White House years stemmed from the absence of such access, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
Even Salinger, who had unlimited access to the Oval Office, said he learned of 
the Bay of Pigs invasion only three hours before it occurred. Jerald terHorst 
learned of Ford's plan to pardon Nixon for any alleged Watergate-related crimes 
the night before that happened -- and then only because he was given the 
ticklish job of telling reporters to be at the White House on a Sunday morning 
without telling them why. 
</P>
<P>
Using the controversy over the Nixon pardon as a backdrop, moderator Chancellor 
asked the press secretaries how they reacted when they personally disagreed 
with the president. In terHorst's case, he felt so adamantly opposed to the 
pardon that he resigned after only about one month on the job -- earning him a 
place, he joked, in the Guinness Book of Records for the shortest term as White 
House press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, argued that their primary job is simply to accurately convey 
the President's viewpoint, regardless of whether they concur with it. Their 
personal opinion, in fact, is of little consequence, several said. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us have been asked . . . whether we agree with what the President has 
just done," Nessen said. "My answer is, 'Who cares?' " 
</P>
<P>
But surely there must have been times, Chancellor prodded -- glancing at 
Ziegler -- when you went home at night and told your wives that "this president 
is a real dope and he's going to get killed" if he doesn't change his policies. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, particularly in the last year and a half," the former Nixon spokesman 
deadpanned. "On a regular basis."

<P>
An El Cajon man pleaded guilty Friday to child molestation involving the use of 
an electrical cord around the throat of an 8-year-old Cub Scout. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Frazier, 21, who recently was a distribution manager for The Wall Street 
Journal, pleaded guilty just as his preliminary hearing was about to start. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier admitted to fondling the genitals of the Cub Scout, who told his 
parents of the incident after Frazier had taken him to his house after a Scout 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier admitted to two allegations, that he kidnaped the victim and used a 
deadly weapon, the electrical cord, during the crime. 
</P>
<P>
"It was wrapped around the child's throat," causing the boy to lose 
consciousness, Deputy Dist. Atty. Harry Elias said. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier could receive a maximum sentence of 19 years in state prison if 
convicted.. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing was set for April 5.

A fire, begun by a 4-year-old boy playing with a lighter, caused $55,000 in 
damages to a Clairemont home Thursday afternoon, San Diego firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, who was not injured, had been playing with a lighter in a closet and, 
firefighters speculate, probably set some clothes afire. 
</P>
<P>
It took 20 firefighters 20 minutes to knock down the blaze in the two-story 
house on Longford Street. The second floor sustained most of the damage, 
$45,000 of which was structural and $10,000 to the contents of the house.

A $10,000 warrant was issued for a former professional basketball player who 
failed to show up Friday to be sentenced for stealing adult videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin (Bad News) Barnes, 37, a former San Diego Clipper who also played for 
other National Basketball Assn. teams, pleaded guilty Nov. 3 to stealing the 
videotapes July 29. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez issued the warrant. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes could be sentenced to two years in state prison because he has a felony 
conviction for burglary, for which his probation has been revoked. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes failed to appear Sept. 26 for arraignment, and a bench warrant was 
issued then as well. Barnes was arrested but released on his own recognizance 
months later.

One of San Diego's 10 most-wanted criminals was captured Friday at Mercy 
Hospital, where he had sought treatment for a gunshot wound in his left leg, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
John Palkovic, 21, wanted for violating parole and on suspicion of attempted 
murder, was not home when police raided his Rancho Penasquitos house at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Police were led to Mercy Hospital, where Palkovic had been admitted under the 
name Brian Hasse. 
</P>
<P>
Before making the arrest at 11 a.m., police had a patient in the same room 
rolled out. 
</P>
<P>
Palkovic was released in November from the California Medical Facility in 
Vacaville after serving one year for auto theft. He is suspected of 
participating in the shooting of a man in December. He was considered "armed 
and extremely dangerous, and extremely violent." 
</P>
<P>
Police were uncertain how or when Palkovic had been wounded.

TESTIMONY ISN'T EXPECTED TO COST ROBBINS HIS SEAT; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGNS: STATE SEN. ALAN ROBBINS IS IN A SAFE DISTRICT UNLESS HE'S CONVICTED 
OF A CRIME, POLITICAL CONSULTANTS SAY. HOWEVER, HE COULD BE IN TROUBLE IF HE 
SEEKS ANOTHER OFFICE.

<TEXT>
<P>
Recent court testimony implicating state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) in the 
capital's political corruption scandal is unlikely to derail a reelection bid, 
though the accusations could harm his chances of capturing any other political 
office, according to public officials and campaign consultants. 
</P>
<P>
"Alan Robbins has amazing resilience, and I don't see as of yet anything that 
would harm his reelection chances," said one campaign consultant. "He has 
proven himself to handle the most adverse publicity, and his district has shown 
themselves to overlook his shortcomings." 
</P>
<P>
Accusations about Robbins have surfaced in the continuing federal corruption 
trial of Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier). Last month, star witness John 
Shahabian, a Senate aide who was trapped in the sting, testified that on advice 
from Robbins, he offered a $3,000 payoff to Montoya for help on a bill to 
obtain state bond financing for a dummy FBI shrimp importing company. Portions 
of the discussions with Robbins were secretly taped. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Shahabian testified that in one of the conversations, Robbins 
"suggested $40,000" would be required to win Senate passage of a bill to help 
the dummy company. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a lobbyist testified that in 1985 he was told Robbins demanded a 
campaign contribution to push a bill on behalf of osteopathic physicians 
through a committee headed by the senator. The lobbyist described the demand -- 
made through third parties -- as "a shakedown." Robbins rejected the testimony 
as untrue. 
</P>
<P>
Public officials and consultants interviewed by The Times on Friday said 
Robbins, who has strong ties to Republicans in the San Fernando Valley, has 
weathered more serious threats to his career. They cited his acquittal on 
felony sex charges in a highly publicized 1981 trial. As evidence of his 
continuing clout, many of those interviewed would only discuss Robbins if they 
were not identified. 
</P>
<P>
Those interviewed said that because of the strong loyalties and the heavy 
Democratic registration of his 20th Senate District constituents, Robbins would 
have to be convicted of a crime before he would face a stiff challenge for his 
Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, one political consultant familiar with Valley politics said he 
expects Republicans will merely "put up a sacrificial lamb" to challenge 
Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
Political fallout over the testimony is more likely to occur if Robbins tries 
to run for another political office, as he has expressed interest in doing, 
political insiders said. 
</P>
<P>
If he were to campaign for any other office, he would not have the many 
benefits of incumbency and could expect to face other well-known candidates 
with sufficient money to finance campaign "hit" pieces directed at him. A 
Senate staff member said an opponent could easily turn the court testimony into 
30-second commercials assailing Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins dismissed suggestions that he faces political damage from the 
testimony. "I think on balance anyone who looks at the overall picture . . . 
would be willing to continue to vote for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, who last spring was identified by sources as a subject of the FBI 
investigation, has not been charged with any crime. An elaborate sting that was 
part of the probe led to the indictment of Montoya on 12 counts of 
racketeering, bribery and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins on Friday emphasized that he had turned down money from the FBI. "I'm 
the only one while being secretly taped who turned down the money. That doesn't 
mean I'm perfect, I'm not . . . That doesn't mean I'm a holier-than-thou type. 
I never said I was . . . The bottom line was that I passed the test. I didn't 
take the money." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Tarzana), a longtime Robbins ally, said Friday he has 
not seen Robbins "cross the line to selling votes . . . I've always found him 
to be very careful." But Bane acknowledged that the senator sometimes "says 
things that can be interpreted in different ways." 
</P>
<P>
Bane said he is among a number of lawmakers subpoenaed by Montoya's lawyers. 
However, Bane said he does not expect to testify in the trial, which enters its 
fifth week on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia) acknowledged that he had been subpoenaed 
but does not anticipate making a court appearance. Robbins also has been 
subpoenaed but has yet to appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a former Los Angeles police chief who represents a district neighboring 
Robbins', said he would have to know more about the conversations between 
Robbins and Shahabian to evaluate whether Robbins behaved improperly. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have to see the tapes in their entirety, " he said. But, Davis added, 
"It certainly isn't something that would be career-enhancing." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the testimony regarding Robbins, Ruth Holton, a spokeswoman for 
California Common Cause, said, "It only confirms the public opinion that 
legislators are taking money for legislation . . . It merely enhances the 
public perception that the whole Legislature is guilty of responding to special 
interests." 
</P>
<P>
The testimony about Robbins, who was first elected to the Senate in 1973, comes 
at a crucial time for the veteran San Fernando Valley lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins has said he would like to seek a Los Angeles County supervisorial seat 
in the San Fernando Valley. He hopes a seat will be created through a lawsuit 
filed by the U.S. Justice Department to force supervisors to redraw district 
lines. But as the trial on the suit began this week, the supervisors voted 3 to 
2 against expanding the board from five to seven members. 
</P>
<P>
With uncertainty surrounding the redistricting case, Robbins appears to be 
hedging his bets. 
</P>
<P>
In late December, Robbins filed a statement of intention to run for reelection, 
according to Sandra Michioku, a spokeswoman for the Fair Political Practices 
Commission. She said Robbins so far is the only candidate in the 20th District 
to file papers, which allows him to raise campaign funds for a Senate contest. 
Robbins previously filed similar papers for the yet-to-be created supervisorial 
seat. On Friday, Robbins confirmed that another option he is considering is a 
race for the Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins faces a final deadline of March 9 to officially put his name on the 
ballot, according to the secretary of state's office.

ACTOR UNHURT AFTER PLANE CRASHES, CATCHES ON FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
AVIATION: A GUST OF WIND BLEW PLANE PILOTED BY JAMES BROLIN OFF RUNWAY.

Actor James Brolin, Emmy Award-winning star of the television series "Marcus 
Welby, M.D.," walked away unhurt from his overturned single-engine plane Friday 
seconds before it burst into flames after a crash on takeoff at Agua Dulce 
Airport, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies reported. 
</P>
<P>
The 49-year-old actor was alone in the 1978 Cessna 182 when a gust of wind from 
behind forced the plane off the runway about 4:20 p.m., authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane flipped down an embankment and the impact apparently ruptured a fuel 
line, starting a fire in the engine compartment, Los Angeles County Fire 
Department Capt. Ted Lindaman said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters allowed the fire to burn out because no structures were 
threatened, Lindaman said. The $25,000 plane, owned by Brolin, was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The wreckage remained beside the pavement Friday night, awaiting inspection by 
federal aviation investigators, authorities said. The airport is about 14 miles 
northeast of Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known if the plane was based at Agua Dulce Airport or had flown in 
from elsewhere. Lindaman said Brolin told authorities he lives in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to "Marcus Welby, M.D.," Brolin starred in the television series 
"Hotel" and has appeared in at least 13 motion pictures, including "The 
Amityville Horror" and "Gable and Lombard." He played Dr. Steven Kiley on 
"Marcus Welby, M.D."

GROUND-WATER CLEANUP TO BE ORDERED AT DUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cancer-causing contaminants have leaked into the ground water from a landfill 
in northern Lancaster, and state officials say they plan to order a cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
The ground-water contamination at the 100-acre Lancaster Landfill, which is run 
by the world's largest waste company, is serious but does not pose an immediate 
threat to nearby drinking water supplies, water quality officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We think this landfill is leaking, and we need to further characterize the 
extent of the contamination," said Hisam Baqai, supervising engineer with the 
state Regional Water Quality Control Board's office in Victorville, which 
oversees the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The landfill's operator, Waste Management of North America, was required to 
complete a search this summer for ground-water pollution. State law says all 
California landfills must perform such tests. 
</P>
<P>
The testing found excessive levels of five pollutants, including at least three 
cancer-causing substances, in monitoring wells that were dug on the landfill 
site and nearby, Baqai said. Other testing showed contaminated water had flowed 
off landfill property to the southeast. 
</P>
<P>
About half-dozen houses are near the landfill, located at 600 E. Avenue F. But 
Baqai said those people's wells draw water from depths of 200 to 300 feet. The 
pollution was found at about 80 feet. However, it could spread, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an important thing," said Rick Schuff, an environmental engineering 
manager for the Illinois-based company. "It's something we're working hard to 
resolve. But I don't think this is an environmental disaster for the Antelope 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Waste Management provides residential trash collection in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Schuff said the company will install a system this year to extract and burn 
methane gas from the landfill. By next year it plans to install a well to 
extract and treat the ground water. State officials said they plan to issue a 
formal cleanup order within a month. 
</P>
<P>
The testing found vinyl chloride and the solvents trichloroethylene and 
perchloroethylene, all carcinogens, at levels exceeding state standards for 
drinking water, Baqai said. The testing also found excessive levels of 
methylene chloride and an organic contaminant called trans-dichloroethylene, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither state nor company officials could say how the contaminants got into the 
landfill, which has been in operation since the mid-1950s. But they speculated 
that the source could have been household refuse or commercial waste in years 
when disposal standards were more lax. 
</P>
<P>
Waste Management took over the landfill in the 1970s, Schuff said. It also runs 
the Bradley West Landfill in Sun Valley, the Simi Valley Landfill and a group 
of residential and commercial trash collection operations in Southern 
California.

GLASNOST TAKES CONTROLS OF A MIG; 
</P>
<P>
FOREIGN RELATIONS: A RAND CORP. EXPERT, AT MOSCOW'S INVITATION, BECOMES THE 
FIRST AMERICAN TO FLY THE SOVIET JET. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Not so long ago, it would have seemed the stuff of a spy thriller. Here was 
Benjamin S. Lambeth, a Cold Warrior by profession, climbing into the cockpit of 
the erstwhile Evil Empire's most sophisticated jet fighter. 
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old Lambeth -- ex-CIA, Harvard Ph.D. and veteran RAND Corp. expert 
on Soviet military affairs -- would be the first American to fly the MIG-29, a 
ride the folks at the Pentagon want to hear all about. 
</P>
<P>
But that's glasnost for you. Lambeth was the Soviets' special guest on his Dec. 
15 flight out of the Kubinka Air Base east of Moscow. His experience, he says, 
was "a minor footnote -- but still a milestone in the Soviet-American 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
"This was much more important as a political event than as a technical event," 
Lambeth said, now back in RAND's Santa Monica headquarters and preparing a 
briefing for the Defense Department. "The fact that it happened is more 
important than anything technical I learned." 
</P>
<P>
Willis Hawkins, a consultant to Lockheed Corp., said the significance of 
Lambeth's flight is "reasonably large" in showing Soviet leader Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's willingness to open military secrets. 
</P>
<P>
The MIG-29, a Mach-2.3 interceptor, is a major advance in Soviet technology. It 
is roughly comparable to the Americans' front-line F-15 and F-16 fighters, 
authorities say, although still a generation behind the most-advanced U.S. 
fighters. 
</P>
<P>
Fluent in Russian, Lambeth has made a career translating and analyzing the 
Soviet press and military papers, first with the CIA in early 1970s and for 15 
years with RAND's National Defense Resarch Institute, an agency sponsored by 
the Office of the Secretary of Defense. He is director of RAND's International 
Security and Defense Policy Program. 
</P>
<P>
His duties at the think tank have helped Lambeth, a civilian pilot, gain 
training and more than 400 hours flying a wide variety of American and foreign 
warplanes. Lambeth described his jet fighter experience as "a mile wide and 
about a half-inch deep." 
</P>
<P>
The Playa del Rey resident believes the Soviets let him fly the MIG-29 in part 
because the U.S. military is not ready to return the favor. The Soviets have 
proposed a reciprocal program to allow pilots from each country to fly the 
other's warplanes, but the U.S. military has thus far declined. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets' motives in letting Lambeth fly also reflect their desire to market 
the MIG-29 to nations beyond such allied states as Cuba and Syria. A Soviet 
leadership that once viewed MIGs as instruments of political leverage now "see 
them as sources of hard currency," Lambeth said. Finland, for example, is now 
debating whether to buy Soviet- or American-made warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
"It remains to be seen how successful that strategy will be . . . The fact 
they're marketing the airplane internationally doesn't mean there's a market 
for it," Lambeth added. 
</P>
<P>
But in another sense, the flight happened simply because Lambeth asked. 
</P>
<P>
While attending the Farnborough Air Show in London in September, 1988, Lambeth 
met Soviet test pilot Valery Menitskii of the Mikoyan Design Bureau, developer 
of the MIG series. "Almost in passing, I said I'd love to be the first American 
analyst to fly the MIG-29," Lambeth recalled. 
</P>
<P>
To his surprise, Menitskii said that it might be possible because of 
extraordinary changes under Gorbachev. "We decided to extend hands across the 
chasm and see what came of it." 
</P>
<P>
Lambeth and Menitskii met again at an air show in Vancouver in August and a 
November aviation symposium at the University of Michigan. Menitskii and other 
members of the Mikoyan Design Team accepted Lambeth's invitation to visit RAND 
last November. (Lambeth also took his guests to Venice's Ocean Front Walk. They 
were amused, Lambeth said, by the scenery.) 
</P>
<P>
Lambeth got his chance to fly during a five-day trip to Moscow with two other 
Russian-speaking RAND Soviet experts, John Hines and Eugene Rumer. The trip was 
devoted primarily to researching evolving U.S.-Soviet relations, arms control 
and European security. 
</P>
<P>
The Russian winter seemed to conspire against Lambeth's flight plans. Blowing 
snow and restricted visibility almost forced cancellation of the flight. "It 
was a day the birds would be walking," Lambeth said. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the afternoon, Lambeth was finally able to take the MIG up. Taking 
turns at the controls with Menitskii in a two-seat trainer model, the MIG 
performed a series of maneuvers that included loops, stall turns, maximum-rate 
rolls and zero-gravity rolls. There was no attempt, however, to explore the 
outer reaches of the "performance envelope," Lambeth said. 
</P>
<P>
Lambeth said he was impressed by the MIG's handling, agility and stability at 
slow speeds -- that it felt very much like an American F-15 or F-18, and a long 
step ahead of the French-made Mirage 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Lambeth said he came away convinced that combat between the MIG-29 and the 
American front-line fighters would ultimately be decided by essentially by the 
skill of the pilots, not by a technological advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Lambeth, Hines and Rumer were given a close look at a future generation MIG 
undergoing stress testing, escorted inside a supersonic wind tunnel and shown 
major subsections of a Soviet space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
A self-decribed "conservative" in his views of U.S.-Soviet relations, Lambeth 
said the experience has helped make him more "neutral" in his regard of the 
Soviet threat. 
</P>
<P>
But just because the Cold War may be over, there's plenty of work for 
Sovietologists -- more now than ever, Lambeth said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Brezhnev era, he explained, the Soviets were predictable. Not so any 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to take the long view," Lambeth said, "when the challenge is 
just to understand the short run."

U-T LABOR TALKS END WITHOUT ACCORD 
</P>

<P>
Representatives of the San Diego Newspaper Guild and the Union-Tribune 
Publishing Co., attempting to resolve an increasingly acrimonious labor dispute 
threatening the two daily newspapers, ended talks Friday without agreement 
after a full day of negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
No date was set for new talks, although both sides expressed hope that some 
sessions could be held next week. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of an agreement, despite the presence of a state mediator, appeared to 
worsen an already grim mood among employees. After Friday's negotiating 
session, workers held a boisterous meeting at their strike headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"People in the plant are just outraged with management," said James Griffin, an 
international representative of the Newspaper Guild who participated in the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a sad day for San Diego journalism," one guild member said after the 
talks ended. 
</P>
<P>
Guild officials accused management of refusing to budge from its position on 
two critical issues: The length of a new contract and the use of company 
vehicles by circulation employees. The guild is seeking a three-year contract, 
while management has offered a one-year package. The company is seeking to cut 
back on use of fleet vehicles, the guild says. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Klein, editor-in-chief of Copley Press, which publishes the morning Union 
and afternoon Tribune, said both sides had made various proposals, but he 
acknowledged that advances were few. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed that there wasn't as much progress as I had hoped," Klein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides, working with the state mediator relaying proposals from room to 
room, met from 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the Hyatt Islandia hotel. One minor 
matter, involving leaves of absence, was resolved, Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
The guild's 1,150 members, including reporters, photographers and employees in 
the advertising, circulation, library and maintenance departments, have been 
without a contract for 18 months. The guild authorized a strike last month. 
</P>
<P>
Talks had resumed Wednesday after a 12-day hiatus.

AGOURA HILLS PROPOSES TRADING PARK TO DEVELOPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Agoura Hills officials disclosed Friday a plan to swap a finished park for a 
larger, undeveloped piece of land, where new park facilities would be built 
with money the city does not yet have. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, about 60 condominiums would be built on the 2.7 acres of 
what is now Agoura Park. In a trade with the condominium developer, the city 
would acquire a nearby 10-acre parcel for a future park. 
</P>
<P>
The Agoura Hills City Council is scheduled to discuss the proposal at its 
regular meeting Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura Park is on the west side of Chesebro Road south of Driver Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The land for the proposed new park, known locally as the Stroud property, is 
slightly to the north, at the northwest corner of Chesebro Road and Driver 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The city's plan calls for building about $1.1 million worth of facilities on 
the 10 acres, including a recreation building, a baseball field and an 
equestrian staging area. 
</P>
<P>
Although smaller, the existing Agoura Park has a ball field, playground, 
basketball court, recreation building and a craft building. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials said a plan to pay for the future park improvements has not 
been developed. Councilwoman Fran Pavley said the city might ask the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy, a state parks agency, for substantial aid. 
</P>
<P>
Pavley said the new park, which is at the end of the Zuma Ridge Trail, would 
have an equestrian emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph T. Edmiston, the conservancy's executive director, said he did not know 
the details of the Agoura Hills proposal. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the agency would be unlikely to fund urban park amenities such as 
baseball fields. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston also noted that the conservancy is considering locating another 
equestrian staging area nearby and would not pay for more than one in the same 
vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
Pavley and Councilwoman Darlene McBane said the parkland swap proposal has 
merit because it would place the Stroud property in the hands of the city, 
preserving it from development. 
</P>
<P>
The land is zoned for about 16 homes, and its owner, Charles Stroud, had plans 
to sell to a developer, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Chesebro Development Group has an option to buy the Stroud property and build 
single-family houses on it. 
</P>
<P>
In the swap, Chesebro would receive Agoura Park, on which the company wants to 
build condominiums for which it needs city approval, City Manager David N. 
Carmany said. 
</P>
<P>
A condominium development on Agoura Park would be consistent with the land next 
to it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the city agrees to the land swap but later refuses to permit construction of 
the condominiums, the entire swap would be voided and Chesebro would be free to 
build houses on the Stroud property, Carmany said. 
</P>
<P>
Pavley estimated that completing a park on the Stroud property could take as 
long as three years. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, programs at Agoura Park such as youth baseball and a "tiny 
tot" preschool would be displaced, said Joe Donofrio, city parks director. 
</P>
<P>
Parks officials would try to find alternate facilities to house those programs, 
he said.

AGOURA MAN INDICTED AS LEADER OF BETTING RING; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: PROSECUTORS SAY COMPUTER CONSPIRACY NETTED MILLIONS.

<P>
An Agoura man was indicted Friday in Las Vegas on charges he headed "The 
Computer Group," a nationwide betting ring that netted millions in profits 
before it was shut down by the FBI on the eve of the 1985 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities unsealed an indictment charging Ivan Mindlin, 61, of 
managing the group, which hired individuals who placed bets on its behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Charges against Mindlin and 18 other defendants include conspiracy, interstate 
transmission of betting information and use of interstate facilities in the aid 
of racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
The betting ring was dubbed the "Computer Group" because members allegedly 
designed a computer program that was fed information on a sporting event to 
determine the betting line on the event. 
</P>
<P>
The group then set up representatives in various cities to bet various events, 
using the computer-generated lines to determine the bets. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI served 45 search warrants in Las Vegas and 22 other cities in a 
nationwide raid Jan. 19, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The raid followed six weeks of electronic surveillance by the FBI at various 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
One informant reported that the group made up to $25 million in profits in 
1984, the year the FBI probe was launched. 
</P>
<P>
James Weller, head of the Nevada FBI office, said the group gambled $12.6 
million and made a net profit of $1.6 million between December, 1984, and Jan. 
19, 1985, when the arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
The group placed bets at a business front known as C&amp;B Collection Agency in 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment named suspects in Las Vegas, Boston and other cities in the 
states of New Jersey, Utah, Tennessee, Pennsylvania and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the charges carries a possible sentence of up to five years in prison 
and a $10,000 fine.

DEVELOPMENT: CALABASAS CITYHOOD PROPONENTS BACK THE REDESIGN. BUT A HOMEOWNERS 
GROUP HAS YET TO CONCUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A builder has reached a tentative agreement with Calabasas cityhood proponents 
to redesign his proposed housing development so that more wildlife habitat will 
be preserved in the rugged terrain where the project will be built, both 
parties said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Baldwin Co. wants to build 550 houses on property where the Los Angeles 
County land-use plan allows 138. 
</P>
<P>
The land is south of the Ventura Freeway and east of Las Virgenes Road. 
</P>
<P>
The redesign was suggested by a state parks agency, the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy. To provide more space for wildlife, 125 of the houses would be 
clustered at the eastern end of the project's 1,300-acre site. The redesign 
would leave about 600 acres of untouched grassy savannah on the western end of 
the site, conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin officials had said they would accept the redesign only with the consent 
of the Calabasas cityhood proponents. The cityhood group agreed to support the 
redesign Friday, cityhood spokesman Dennis Washburn said. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood proponents had already agreed to accept the 550 housing units in 
exchange for Baldwin dropping its opposition to cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
But Baldwin's agreement to the latest revisions is also dependent on whether 
the Calabasas Park Homeowners Assn. agrees not to oppose the developer's 
proposal for the 550 houses, said Bob Burns, Baldwin vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, under pressure from the homeowners, Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Mike Antonovich agreed to support no more than 350 houses on the Baldwin site. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner association representatives could not be reached for comment Friday. 
The group is expected to discuss the redesign at a meeting later this month, 
Edmiston said.

COMPLAINTS FILED OVER HOW MAYOR WAS NAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has been asked to investigate 
whether three Rancho Palos Verdes council members violated the state's 
open-meeting law by allegedly deciding among themselves in private who the 
city's next mayor should be. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. James Hickey said that two complaints had been filed 
requesting the district attorney to determine whether council members Jacki 
Bacharach, Douglas Hinchliffe and Mel Hughes violated the Brown Act by 
allegedly agreeing before a publicly convened council meeting that they would 
cast their votes for Hughes for the honorary post. 
</P>
<P>
The Brown Act mandates that public representatives conduct official business in 
public, although there are some exceptions permitted for personnel and legal 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
The three council members, who make up a council majority, voted Dec. 5 to 
appoint Hughes to the mayor's post, even though under city tradition Mayor Pro 
Tem John McTaggart would normally have gotten the job. Bacharach was mayor at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
The three were opposed by McTaggart and Councilman Bob Ryan, and it created an 
uproar at the meeting. McTaggart's supporters have continued to demand that the 
council majority rescind its vote. 
</P>
<P>
Hinchliffe this week denied that he or his council allies violated the Brown 
Act. Earlier in the week, before the complaints had been received by the 
district attorney, Bacharach called them "ludicrous." Hughes could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Although the district attorney's office does not release the names of people 
who file such complaints until after an investigation is closed, Grant A. 
Stucki, a Rancho Palos Verdes resident and McTaggart supporter, said he filed 
one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Stucki said he took the action after learning from a local newspaper reporter 
that Bacharach had publicly admitted that she, Hughes and Hinchliffe decided 
among themselves before the vote was taken that Hughes should be mayor but did 
not tell Ryan or McTaggart. 
</P>
<P>
"It is immoral, improper, illegal and unethical," Stucki said. 
</P>
<P>
Bacharach declined to discuss specifics of the issue, but Hinchliffe said that 
he did have separate discussions with her and Hughes about who should be the 
city's next mayor. 
</P>
<P>
He said the three did not meet to discuss the issue and did not come to a 
decision on how they would vote before the council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you there was no agreement," Hinchliffe said. 
</P>
<P>
Hickey said the complaints will be evaluated "as quickly as possible." If it is 
proven that the council majority knowingly violated the Brown Act, each could 
be charged with a criminal misdemeanor, which carries a maximum penalty of six 
months in jail and a $500 fine.

ARCHER'S EARLY LEAD HOLDS UP; 
</P>
<P>
SENIOR GOLF: HE HAS A TWO-STROKE ADVANTAGE OVER RODRIGUEZ. NOBODY ELSE IN 
20-MAN FIELD IS UNDER PAR.

<P>
George Archer is one old-time golfer who is happy teeing off early in the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Archer and his playing partner, Chi Chi Rodriguez, were the seventh pair to tee 
off Friday for the second round of the MONY Tournament of Champions at La Costa 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Archer shot a 69, three under par, over the 7,022-yard course for a two-shot 
lead at the halfway point of the senior division of the tournament. After 36 
holes, Archer is at 142, two under par. Rodriguez had a 71 for a 144 total. The 
other 18 players from the 50-and-older tour were over par. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's not too cold and you don't have to lead off, it is an advantage for us 
to go first," said Archer, playing in only his sixth senior event. "Up and down 
the coast they are using greens with poa annua grass. It is fine for greens, 
except that a footprint will remain on the green until they cut it again. By 
late in the day, there are a lot of footprints and putting is much more 
difficult. Also, here the wind comes up after noon, so that's another reason 
we're lucky to tee off early." 
</P>
<P>
Archer had the hot putter early, sinking birdie putts of 20, 25, 10 and eight 
feet on the front nine to post a 32. The putter didn't work as well on the back 
side and he had all pars except the 450-yard 10th, the toughest par-four on the 
course. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to get within rage for a long iron to the green, Archer pushed his drive 
into the rough. On the next shot his backswing was restricted by a tree and he 
pulled the ball into the deep rough on the left, just short of the water. He 
chipped long and missed a 20-footer par putt. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a 69 on this course is very good," Archer said. "It's the longest 
course we play. It's difficult for us, but the regular tour players don't think 
it's tough. They play tougher courses. 
</P>
<P>
"I am really enjoying myself on this tour. I was told it was fun and it is. 
Everybody's smiling. We all can't be comics like Chi Chi, but we have a good 
time. It's great to play with Chi Chi. But I was disappointed today. He had the 
crowd going and I gave him some good lines and he didn't use them." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez birdied the last two holes to provide the first challenge for Archer 
after he had built a four-shot lead. He said that for the seniors, par is 75. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why a bogey doesn't hurt," he said. "If you just keep parring, you'll 
do all right. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a good idea. It lets everybody know that the young guys are 
the best golfers. That's why they're on the big tour. Sometimes, playing 
shorter courses, guys finish 14 or 15 under. They get the idea they're as good 
as the youngsters. This tournament shows we're not." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez also explained the difference between old-timers and the current crop 
of pros. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us were caddies," he said. "Our goal was to become the pro at a course 
like this. These serious kids' goal is to own the course." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said his desire to be No. 1 on the Senior Tour has been rekindled. He 
said he is a person in control of his life. Just to prove it he stops smoking 
every Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
"This year I discovered a way to avoid withdrawal," he said. "I went down to 
the ocean and stuck my head in the water every morning. The salt water has all 
these minerals that are good for you. They got in back of my eyes and cleared 
out all the nicotine." 
</P>
<P>
Also in contention at 145 are Al Geiberger, who had a 71 Saturday, Bruce 
Crampton and Bobby Nichols, the co-leader after the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Crampton has played 34 holes at three under but a double bogey each day has 
cramped his style. Thursday, his first shot stayed up in a tree and he wound up 
with a double bogey. And Friday, the fifth hole foiled him. He hit a ball into 
a gully, an unplayable lie, and wound up with a six. 
</P>
<P>
With 36 holes to play, contention runs deep. There are 12 golfers within six 
shots of Archer. Defending champion Miller Barber is one of them. He had a 
Rodriguez par -- a 75 -- and is five back at 147.

SMOKING POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have just finished Max Jacobson's article on ethnic restaurants in Orange 
County ("World on a Platter," Calendar) and find myself quite critical of the 
omission of any information regarding the smoking policy of the restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps restaurant reviewers by and large do not smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they're among the legions of hostile anti-smokers. But that in no way 
should preclude their giving this information. 
</P>
<P>
We are told about the decor, the food, the prices, even the history and lineage 
of the chef, so why not include smoking information? 
</P>
<P>
I spoke to Jacobson some time ago, and he said that Pascal's in Newport Beach 
does not allow smoking. In his recent review of the restaurant, he did not 
mention this policy. We would have been irked had we decided to go there only 
to be told that there was no designated smoking section. 
</P>
<P>
I respect the right of every restaurant to set its own smoking policy. But tell 
me before I move in that direction. Regardless of personal feelings, this is 
pertinent information and should appear in any restaurant review.

<P>
Environmental change -- from polluted streams to congested highways and 
overdeveloped land -- is affecting the quality of life across the nation. Such 
change is gradual and often goes unnoticed while it happens. 
</P>
<P>
 To measure how various areas have been affected over the decades, The Times 
dispatched reporters to the places where they grew up. This occasional series 
of articles examines how our hometown environments have been altered -- for 
better or for worse. 
</P>
<P>
Farmer James Mishoe does not have time to change out of his Sunday suit and tie 
before he drives his pickup the 12 miles north from Salem African Methodist 
Episcopal Church to this small town. 
</P>
<P>
"Got to work every day," he says, unloading turnips, collards and sweet 
potatoes at his produce stand in the shade of a tall oak tree in the heart of 
Conway's black community. 
</P>
<P>
Mishoe, 59, is on the board of stewards at Salem Church in the town of 
Bucksport, but the troubles he has seen would test the faith of even a 
presiding elder. 
</P>
<P>
His wife's failing health, the end of his family's tradition of tobacco 
farming, the threat of foreclosure on his property and a fire at his farmhouse 
in 1975 have all transformed his way of life. 
</P>
<P>
But, in a way, Mishoe is lucky. He has made a living selling produce since the 
decline of the tobacco market of the 1970s. But now he is intimately bound to 
another habit-forming, some say addicting, pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists. 
</P>
<P>
After unloading part of his produce and leaving his youngest son, Roger, at the 
cash register, Mishoe will drive 14 more miles southeast on Highway 501 to 
Myrtle Beach, for his livelihood is now tied to how much fresh produce he can 
sell from his truck directly to restaurants catering to the tourist trade 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Mishoe moved to Conway while trying to find money to rebuild his farmhouse. Few 
things are the same in Conway, he says, since tourism came. 
</P>
<P>
He's right. I know; I was raised here. 
</P>
<P>
Conway is a little town in the eastern part of South Carolina. Its shift from 
Southern rural backwater to Yankee tourist attraction has begun to put pressure 
on its environment. Developers are bulldozing surrounding forests and farmlands 
for commercial and residential development, pleasure boaters are polluting 
nearby rivers, and population growth -- including many Northern retirees -- is 
causing unease in an area unused to urban congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more subtly, the region's old rural, laissez-faire attitudes, which 
didn't see much wrong with burning trash in the back yard, dumping liquid waste 
in the ground or filling in the wetlands that channel storm runoff, are under 
serious challenge today. And government, so far, has seemed unable to develop 
the infrastructure -- such things as sewers and roads -- quickly enough to 
support the growth. 
</P>
<P>
Conway, population 13,576, is the seat of Horry County (pronounced Oh-REE), 
population 137,989. The county is shaped like a fat slice of sweet potato pie 
and is part of the Pee Dee River Basin, an area of nearly 7,700 square miles, 
about one-fourth of the state. 
</P>
<P>
Six rivers crisscross the basin like veins and arteries on the back of a hand. 
These rivers generally flow southeast, emptying 10.5 billion gallons of water a 
day into the Atlantic Ocean. One of the rivers, the Waccamaw, meanders slowly 
past downtown Conway. 
</P>
<P>
When Hurricane Hugo came ashore in South Carolina last September, the Waccamaw 
briefly flooded its banks. "There was also an awful lot of debris in the 
streets," said Conway city planner Steve Tanner. But there was little permanent 
damage and only a few injuries, caused by downed electrical wires. 
</P>
<P>
"A mugging in downtown Conway would be a major event," said Bill Keeling, 
director of the county museum on Main Street at the edge of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Huge oak trees shade narrow, quiet streets throughout Conway. Such scenes 
appear on brochures now to attract tourists, residents and businesses. "Anybody 
threatens to cut one branch off an oak tree, you get the whole town up in 
arms," said Evelyn Snyder, 82, one of the town's unofficial historians. 
</P>
<P>
The town's black community, where I lived, built its churches and barber shops 
on a street ironically named Race Path and educated its children at a high 
school ironically named after a Boston carpetbagger. The iron web of 
segregation forced the black community (Conway is about 34% black) to shape 
itself around care and concern of its members, one for the other. 
</P>
<P>
I remember that tobacco also shaped the black community. Attendance at the 
all-black Whittemore High School would drop precipitously every 
tobacco-harvesting season. The planters demanded child labor to raise the crop 
out of the sandy gray soil and into the curing sheds. Desperately poor parents 
worked the fields beside their children. 
</P>
<P>
No more. 
</P>
<P>
"One time, boys made $20 a day cropping tobacco. What tobacco field can you 
crop today?" asked Eutrelia P. Dozier, another local historian and librarian at 
Whittemore, now restructured and renamed West Conway Middle School. She is at 
the same school, still the librarian, as she has been since 1954. 
</P>
<P>
Says farmer Mishoe: "When I came home (from military service) in 1960 and went 
to the farm, I sold tobacco for 75 cents a pound. At that time, fertilizer was 
running a $1 1/2 for 100 pounds, or $3 for 200 pounds. Then, in 1979, I sold 
tobacco for 75 cents a pound, and fertilizer was $6 or $10 for 100 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
He gave up in 1981. "Tobacco farming? That's out." 
</P>
<P>
Downtown, the tractors and pickup trucks around which people used to gather and 
talk have been replaced by cars just passing through on their way to Coastal 
Mall, near the northern edge of town. 
</P>
<P>
Now, private and public agencies have started a project called Main Street 
U.S.A. to revitalize downtown and to draw tourists by highlighting its 
"small-town" atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Last May 17, Mayor Ike G. Long Jr. mounted a bulldozer near downtown where the 
Waccamaw River flows, tore a plug of dirt from a temporary earthen dam and 
water from the river rushed into the town's 71-boat marina to mark its official 
opening. The marina is part of a planned 35 1/2-acre riverfront development 
with shops, restaurants, condominiums, office complexes and a boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
Travel-related spending in Horry County for 1987 was $1.4 billion, according to 
the U.S. Travel Data Center, far larger than any other county in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The same year, agriculture in the county generated only $90 million in 
expenditures, said Jack Hutchinson of the South Carolina development board, 
which is responsible for bringing new industry and business to the state. 
</P>
<P>
Myrtle Beach, where Mishoe sells much of his produce, and Conway began to 
interest tourists and retirees when the gasoline crisis hit in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Then, people from the North heading to Florida, their gas tanks running low, 
began to notice South Carolina, Hutchinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism and the growth it has brought have compelled Conway's officials to 
focus on the natural wetlands in the riverfront district between downtown and 
the Waccamaw River. These areas help protect the town's ecosystem, city planner 
Tanner said. 
</P>
<P>
"Cars park in parking lots, trucks park in parking lots, rain comes and the 
runoff goes into the Waccamaw River. . . . Well, if we route drainage through 
the wetlands, it will act as a filtering system for the pollutants, before it 
gets to the river. . . . The water quality of the Waccamaw probably will be one 
of the biggest items that will . . . determine the growth of Conway," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There are other problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Boat owners are horrendous polluters," said Robert Windhager, treasurer of a 
local chapter of the Sierra Club. "They toss shoes, paper, plastic plates" into 
the Waccamaw, "not to mention the gas and oil spills" from their boat engines, 
which threaten local aquaculture, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Such problems are not new to the area. Although Conway itself has had zoning 
laws for years, "Horry County didn't have zoning laws until October, 1988," 
Tanner said. The result? "Around somebody's house you get (an animal) pound on 
one side and an auto repair shop on the other, and the well water starts 
tasting funny and the people get sick," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, "We'll probably be 20 years behind on river and wetlands laws. 'Let's let 
in all the developers and then we'll write a (water protection) law that nobody 
likes,' " he mused. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the town grows. "In 1980, the census showed Conway with 10,240 
people," Mayor Long said. "They say that by the year 2005 Conway, and . . . a 
3-mile radius around Conway, will have 65,000 people. . . . We're annexing 
property coming and going." 
</P>
<P>
Retired people moving south find a slower pace and a lower cost of living here, 
Long said. Upscale joggers in the newer Kingston Lake residential section of 
town run along tree-shaded roads near two-story brick homes with wide lawns. 
</P>
<P>
But, not far away, mobile home salesmen at "independent living centers" sell 
"double-wides" to the less-well-heeled. "Your New Home -- $11,600," one sign 
says. That's the selling price, not the down payment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Areas Resist 
</P>
<P>
Although much of downtown Conway has resisted many of the changes, other areas 
have not. 
</P>
<P>
"You used to be able to drive 501 all the way to Myrtle Beach and see nothing 
but woods," said Reggie Daves of the local Audubon Society. "You can't do that 
anymore. Now you see tire stores, motorcycle shops . . . food places, filling 
stations, golf courses." 
</P>
<P>
Farmers not in the path of development are caught between low land values, 
payments on the mortgage and equipment and the temptation to sell to 
developers, said Draxal Strickland, organizer of the local chapter of the 
United Farmers Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Long adds: "A farmer today could do better if he runs water and sewer 
lines into his property and rents it out as a mobile home park." 
</P>
<P>
Farmer Mishoe's produce stand is right across Highway 501 from Cherry Hill 
Baptist Church, the sanctuary of my youth. On many Sunday mornings after 
service these days, church-goers try to get to Mishoe's stand by crossing 501 
at the light there while beach-goers are streaming down 501 to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the traffic lights change (for crossing 501) for only about three or 
four seconds," said Rev. H. H. Singleton, pastor of the church and head of the 
Conway branch of the NAACP. "People have begun to seek alternative routes, to 
see if they can go down (to a major intersection) and come back up, you see. 
And that's what most of them do." 
</P>
<P>
Tourism thus shapes Conway's quality of life, because the traffic on Highway 
501 shows how much the town lives in the shadow of Myrtle Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Golf courses, resort hotels, beaches, topless bars, crowding and escalating 
land values have put the beach city on the map. That bothers a lot of Conway 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
"Horry County has one of the largest black bear populations in South Carolina; 
there are predatory birds by the millions, but along that beach it's like 
Southern New Jersey," museum director Keeling said. "I have seen traffic backed 
up from Myrtle Beach back through Conway to the county line. . . . One solid 
traffic jam." 
</P>
<P>
To ease beach traffic jams, the state highway department plans to build a 
bypass on Highway 501 around Conway. But a possible route is through prime land 
in private hands, including large tracts owned by International Paper Co. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Long said that the highway department "doesn't want to mess up the bears 
and snakes and alligators and Venus flytraps, so they plan to build a bridge 10 
miles long over the woods . . . at a cost of about 10 times more per mile than 
a regular bridge." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trash Problem Grows 
</P>
<P>
As tourism has grown, the trash problem has also become a major concern. 
</P>
<P>
The Horry County landfill is 5 miles southeast of Conway. All non-hazardous 
waste throughout the county is delivered to the 200-acre site, said Philip 
Barnhill, county director of waste management. (Hazardous waste is supposed to 
be shipped 85 miles east to the Pinewood hazardous waste dump in Sumter 
County.) 
</P>
<P>
One day recently, worn tires were aflame in the tire-dump area in the heart of 
the landfill, giving off thick, acrid smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Mildred Lewis, a resident of Horseshoe, a community just north of the facility, 
believes the landfill is the reason for many illnesses in her neighborhood. 
Recently, she drove through her community of small houses and double-wide 
mobile homes on dirt yards with tall pines and talked about her neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"That woman live there? Her grandson is on disability; been on disability for 
eight years; he ain't but 18. . . . That lady's got cancer; so's her son. . . . 
That man who used to live there died at 43 from a heart attack." 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, the state Department of Health and Environmental Control 
investigated such health claims and found that the problems weren't caused by 
the landfill, according to Barnhill. 
</P>
<P>
The idea that the landfill meets health department standards makes some of the 
state's leading environmentalists laugh. At a conference last summer in 
Columbia, the state capital, they adopted a resolution that said the 
department's environmental standards are so low that the agency "should be 
abolished" if it does not improve. 
</P>
<P>
Some other possible improvements are within reach. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental consultant Marsh suggests that developers should pay higher fees 
for hidden costs, such as road repair and increased sewer maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh said that an associate who looked into the state laws came away 
"horrified at the lax requirements for new roads in South Carolina." 
</P>
<P>
The Audubon Society's Reggie Daves says that citizens need to take more 
independent civic action on environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
A report commissioned by the county government said that the county must 
diversify its industry, improve agriculture and aquaculture technology and 
develop a European trade office, so that there will be less dependence on 
tourism. 
</P>
<P>
But some solutions are not local. "We're going to have to change our throwaway 
society into one that recycles," said County Administrator M. L. Love. "I don't 
think Horry County does any better or worse than any other county in dealing 
with trash. . . . L.A. has the same problem I have." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Crises Loom 
</P>
<P>
Other national solutions are also required, because two major environmental 
crises are on the horizon. The Pinewood dump in nearby Sumter County, the 
state's only site for hazardous wastes, is inadequate and dangerous, said Carol 
Boykin, vice president of Citizens Asking for a Safe Environment, situated in 
Sumter city. Some companies may be tempted to dump such wastes illegally in the 
state's vast rivers and forests, she said. 
</P>
<P>
And the troubled Savannah River nuclear weapons materials plant in Barnwell 
County has been shut down partly because of poor handling of its radioactive 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
Both of those huge facilities are in poor sections of South Carolina counties 
that do not have much political power, Boykin said. "We're being treated like 
Third World nations," she said: Dangerous materials nobody wants are being 
dumped in places few have heard of. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism and other transformations have hit Conway hard. 
</P>
<P>
But "tourism itself is not bad," Keeling concludes. He sees a parallel, though, 
in the quick-up, quick-down experience of oil boom towns, which have fallen on 
hard times recently. "Tourists are like oil with legs," he said. They are a 
boon for a time, but what if they stop coming? 
</P>
<P>
Changes in Conway that did not hit hard hit fast. 
</P>
<P>
"Thirty-five years ago, people were plowing with mules here," Keeling said. "My 
father-in-law can remember riding on riverboats on the Waccamaw River." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Keeling would not suggest that Conway should be stuck in the 19th Century. 
Indeed, anyone can see there are plenty of reasons for this small town to move 
to the 21st Century. But it will take extraordinary leadership, cooperation, 
sacrifice, creativity and vision for Conway to completely skip the 20th.

PANAMA ACTION A 'CATCH-22' FOR LATIN RELATIONS 
</P>

"The effect of the Panama operation has been stunning," a senior U.S. diplomat 
said Friday. "Panama has been as shocking a development for Latin America as 
the revolutions in Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Romania have been for 
Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after the invasion of Panama, U.S. and Latin American diplomats are 
just beginning to sort out the long-term effects. And their initial assessment 
is that the military operation has dealt a serious blow to U.S.-Latin 
relations, despite the early optimism of some American officials. 
</P>
<P>
"People are stunned that we actually did it," explained the harried diplomat, 
caught between calls to Latin American officials to try to sell the U.S. 
position. "They thought this kind of intervention belonged to the old days." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the diplomatic fallout, the invasion has created long-term headaches for 
the United States as it assumes the neo-colonial burden of rebuilding Panama, 
officials said. The Bush Administration is finding itself in a Catch-22 squeeze 
between its desire to bring troops home early, yet to remain in Panama long 
enough to remake the country's military and police force. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, officials and analysts believe that there may soon be serious 
tension between the Administration and the civilian Panamanian government that 
it installed in power -- because the only way President Guillermo Endara can 
establish legitimacy as a national leader, one official says, "is to bite the 
hand that feeds him." 
</P>
<P>
But the most immediate problem, officials said, is reassuring other Latin 
American countries that the Panama operation is not the first of a new wave of 
U.S. military adventures in the Caribbean, reminiscent of the first half of the 
century when presidents sent troops into Mexico, Nicaragua, Haiti and other 
countries to enforce Washington's will. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the overwhelming popularity of the invasion in the United States and 
Panama -- where a poll released Friday found a whopping 92% approval for the 
presence of U.S. troops -- most Latin American governments remain upset. 
</P>
<P>
The invasion was "condemnable . . . a new and disgraceful humiliation for our 
peoples," complained Venezuela's President Carlos Andres Perez, one of South 
America's senior statesmen and a frequent diplomatic ally of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, Latin officials said, is that President Bush is asserting a right 
that they do not want to accept: to send U.S. troops south of the border if 
American citizens are in danger or when it seems to be the only way to oust a 
noxious dictator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Tears for Noriega 
</P>
<P>
The outcry has been tempered by the fact that Manuel A. Noriega, the Panama 
strongman, had become a public embarrassment to the rest of the hemisphere; no 
Latin government is shedding tears over Noriega's fall. Perez, for example, 
called the general's regime "shameful" and said that other Latin American 
countries shared some blame for failing to force him out of office by peaceful 
means. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a senior Latin American diplomat complained to U.S. officials this week: 
"Good causes don't justify breaking good principles." 
</P>
<P>
The principle the Latin countries want restored is nonintervention -- because 
many see it as the main diplomatic weapon against U.S. interference in their 
internal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush acknowledged the problem -- and the Latin Americans' concerns -- 
during a White House news conference Friday. "To some degree I am concerned, 
because I am well aware of how our friends south of our border . . . look at 
the use of American force anywhere," Bush said. "Given the history of the use 
of U.S. force, I would be remiss if I didn't face up to the problem that we 
must go forward diplomatically now to explain . . . that we acted, in our view, 
well within our rights." 
</P>
<P>
"I view this as very, very important diplomacy, and I am determined not to 
neglect the democracies in this hemisphere," Bush added, saying that he is 
sending Vice President Dan Quayle to the area later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Other officials said that the Administration is trying to reassure Latin 
governments that the invasion of Panama is not a harbinger of more such 
operations. "Is Panama a precedent for Nicaragua? No," one senior official 
said. "Panama was unique." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the invasion has had "a Grenada effect" -- meaning that it has 
impressed foreigners with the Administration's readiness to use military power, 
as did President Ronald Reagan's 1983 invasion of the Caribbean island of 
Grenada. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of that is good, and some is bad," the official added. "The good part is 
that the United States is no longer the laughingstock of the hemisphere; we 
have shown that we can't be pushed around. The bad part is that we no longer 
have the resources to run the world, so we're going to have to concert our 
efforts with other countries -- and this makes that effort more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rebuilding the PDF 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, "Our longer-term problems in Panama haven't really been 
defined yet. There is going to be trouble down the road. The economy is very 
fragile. . . . We aren't sure yet how far to go in rebuilding the PDF (Panama 
Defense Forces). 
</P>
<P>
"There is tension between the speed of the American withdrawal and what you do 
with the PDF," he continued. "If you rebuild the institution completely and 
reorient it toward a police function, that increases the load on the United 
States. The question is, how much does one rebuild?" 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that he plans to withdraw the troops he dispatched to Panama last 
month "as soon as possible." But other officials, and analysts outside the 
government, said that a continuing U.S. military presence to remake the corrupt 
PDF may be the key to the survival of democracy in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration may be able to withdraw most or all of the 14,000 combat 
troops who streamed into Panama before Christmas. But it also may have to send 
in other forces to train and assist the PDF in both military and police skills, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, the United States is responsible for virtually all government 
services in Panama and for creating the democracy that we said we were going to 
restore," said Robert Kurz, a Central America expert at Washington's Brookings 
Institution. "If you act too quickly and take short cuts, you're going to 
undermine the goals you're after. . . . If you're in too much of a hurry, 
you're going to blow it." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to break the back of the PDF," he added. "The PDF was not just 
Noriega. It was an octopus with tentacles in all parts of the government and 
the business world. It owned hotels, duty-free shops and a bank. If you don't 
dismantle that apparatus of corruption, you end up where you started." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, however, U.S. military authorities in Panama have mapped out no 
clear course for reforming the PDF. Instead, in the interest of reconstituting 
a Panamanian police force as soon as possible, they have allowed most PDF 
officers to keep their jobs as long as they swear loyalty to the new Endara 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, noted Richard Millett, a professor at Southern Illinois University, 
"American tutelage is going to be a very bitter pill for the Panamanian 
military to swallow." 
</P>
<P>
At least since 1968, when charismatic Gen. Omar Torrijos seized power, Panama's 
military has defined its mission at least partly in terms of asserting 
Panamanian sovereignty over the U.S. troops who have been present in the 
country since the building of the Panama Canal. 
</P>
<P>
"Endara is not going to get much recognition from other Latin countries until 
the (additional) U.S. troops are out," Millett said. "And he isn't going to get 
much legitimacy at home if he doesn't at least jab the United States in the 
ribs once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress is going to be asked to provide him with plenty of economic aid, but 
we shouldn't expect too much gratitude over the long term," he added.

<P>
FOR BUSH, PANAMA SEEN AS MAJOR 'POLITICAL BONANZA' 
</P>

<P>
Whatever the cost in lives or long-term U.S. relations with Latin America, the 
massive U.S. invasion of Panama appears to be a tremendous political plus for 
President Bush -- maybe "the biggest political bonanza" to come any President's 
way in 25 or 30 years, in the view of one senior Bush adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Republican strategists, almost euphoric over public reaction to the military 
operation, declare that Bush finally has shed the "wimp" image that has dogged 
him since the 1988 presidential campaign. A GOP poll shows that Americans 
heavily favor the operation and that they are ready to leave American troops in 
Panama "as long as necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Even Democrats concede that, despite hundreds of casualties on both sides and 
heavy destruction in Panama City, the military operation represents a big 
political plus for the President, at least for the immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
Down the road, however, Panama could pose a variety of problems for Bush -- 
from lasting damage to U.S.-Latin American relations and possible embarrassing 
disclosures at the drug trial of deposed strongman Manuel A. Noriega to the 
high cost of rehabilitating Panama and propping up the U.S.-installed 
government of Guillermo Endara. 
</P>
<P>
Some Latin American leaders have been extremely critical of the invasion, and 
specialists in Latin American affairs say that the damage goes beyond 
traditional rhetoric. Further, estimates of the cost of restoring Panama's 
economy -- devastated first by more than two years of U.S. economic sanctions 
and now by the invasion -- will run into the billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost of proselytizing democracy is not cheap," warned James Schlesinger, a 
former Cabinet member of the Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter administrations. 
He said that the United States will pay a heavy price in damaged Latin American 
relations if it leaves "a lot of wreckage behind." 
</P>
<P>
Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater insisted that he sees no 
possible political downside to the Panama operation. But the President himself 
recognizes he may yet confront political fallout that is not all positive. 
</P>
<P>
At a White House news conference Friday, Bush expressed concern that U.S.-Latin 
American relations may have been adversely affected. He pledged to campaign 
personally and send Vice President Dan Quayle on a mission to Latin American 
countries to try to repair any damage. And he emphasized that he has given 
"major priority" to revitalizing Panama's economy and providing the country 
with humanitarian assistance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nothing to Say' 
</P>
<P>
The President, who has said he is not concerned about the possibility of any 
embarrassing disclosures at a trial of Noriega, suddenly turned prickly when a 
reporter asked whether he had been aware of any drug trafficking by Noriega 
from 1981 to 1986, the period when a federal indictment alleges that the 
Panamanian was involved in a drug conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring that he had made statements on that subject in the past and did not 
want to "even inadvertently prejudice" the case against Noriega, Bush told the 
reporter: "So punch it in the computer, and I'll have nothing more to say about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
In the past Bush has said that he did not know Noriega was suspected of drug 
trafficking until the Panamanian was indicted in February, 1988. Bush has 
denounced as "total lies" rumors of a secret Noriega-Bush connection. 
</P>
<P>
As CIA director during the Ford Administration and later as vice president, 
Bush did have an official relationship with Noriega. But the President has 
pointed out that it was the Ronald Reagan-Bush administration "that brought 
this man to justice." 
</P>
<P>
The Noriega case notwithstanding -- and its final resolution may be a year or 
more away -- leaders of both parties say that Bush has reaped a rich political 
harvest from the military operation. 
</P>
<P>
"He knocked the question about being timid and a wimp out of the stadium," 
declared GOP chairman Atwater. "He listed four goals for the invasion -- 
protecting American lives, restoring democracy in Panama, protecting U.S. 
rights under the Panama Canal Treaty and capturing Noriega -- and he completed 
the mission. It was an absolute jackpot. The biggest single problem in America 
is drugs and the President just nabbed the king of the drug kingpins." 
</P>
<P>
Political observers of both parties said that scenes of Panamanians cheering 
American troops and denouncing Noriega while officials of the Vatican embassy 
were pressuring him to surrender cast the U.S. invasion -- and therefore Bush 
-- in a highly favorable light. 
</P>
<P>
"The President went up against a guy everybody thinks is a scumbag and with the 
papal nuncio working against the guy, too, it had the imprimatur of rightness 
to it," said James Lake, a Washington consultant who was a senior official in 
Bush's presidential campaign. "And the Panamanians cheering the American 
soldiers showed the President did the right thing for the right reason." 
</P>
<P>
Although some Democrats suggested that a prolonged American occupation of 
Panama could cause political problems for Bush, a GOP strategist cited a party 
poll which showed that 77% of Americans favor keeping U.S. troops in the 
country "until we are sure the new government is in control even though it may 
be several months." Only 14% said that the troops should be withdrawn "in a 
week or so." 
</P>
<P>
Former Democratic Party Chairman Robert Strauss, who opposed the invasion and 
who said that it may still emerge as a political issue, nonetheless declared 
that it is an immediate political windfall for Bush and caps "a very good first 
year" for him as President. Agreed former Chairman John White: "Bush is on a 
real high right now and there's no question but it's a political plus." 
</P>
<P>
Although Democratic Chairman Ron Brown said "we have to applaud (that) we 
played a role in restoring democracy in our hemisphere," he cautioned that any 
long-term analysis "is very premature at this point." 
</P>
<P>
"Atwater grossly overstates the case," he said. "Most responsible people have 
tried to assess the operation in a nonpartisan way. It's too early to tell what 
the real consequences are. A lot depends on how the new government makes the 
transition. A lot will depend on the Noriega trial and how that proceeds." 
</P>
<P>
However, two prominent Washington-based Democratic consultants, Peter Hart, and 
Greg Schneiders, said that they see plenty of political gain and little or no 
downside for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans accomplished what they needed to, and the President directed the 
operation and he became the beneficiary of it," Hart said. "More than just the 
political gain is what it does for the President's self-confidence. He has to 
feel very good about it. The sense of self-mastery he gets from it should be 
important as he handles other crises." 
</P>
<P>
Said Schneiders: "It's an unquestionable gain for him."

2% YEARLY DEFENSE CUTS BACKED BY WHITE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: A FIVE-YEAR PLAN REFLECTS A MAJOR SHIFT IN U.S. PRIORITIES. BUT 
CONGRESS MAY SEEK SHARPER REDUCTIONS.

<P>
In another step toward scaling down the nation's military, the White House has 
approved a tight-money budget scenario that calls for defense spending to 
shrink by 2% annually over the next five years, Bush Administration officials 
confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The White House action brings closer to reality what is expected to be a major 
recasting of U.S. defense priorities, cancellation of weapons programs and 
demobilization of thousands of troops in response to budget constraints and 
improving East-West relations. 
</P>
<P>
At the time the Pentagon drew up its budget last year, the 2% cutbacks were 
considered a worst-case scenario, less likely to go into effect than other, 
more modest options. But now, with the upheaval in Eastern Europe continuing, 
they have become the Administration's plan. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is to relay the broad outlines of the 1991-95 
budget plan later this month to Congress, which is expected to demand even 
sharper reductions. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which Administration sources said was approved by White House Budget 
Director Richard G. Darman in late December, projects that defense budgets will 
rise from $295.1 billion in 1991 to $312 billion in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
But, after accounting for the effects of expected inflation in those years, the 
defense budget would actually decline by 2% each year, Administration officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In drafting contingency plans at Cheney's instruction, the military services 
warned in November that they would have to cut 290,000 military personnel from 
their rolls over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials have said that they hope to maintain the war-readiness of 
U.S. forces as the size of the armed forces shrinks, but they have acknowledged 
that the troops will be equipped with older weapons. 
</P>
<P>
For the Army, which is expected to order a demobilization as sweeping as that 
following the Vietnam War, the coming budget shrinkage already has spurred a 
major redefinition of the service's principal missions and the arms needed to 
accomplish them. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1995, the scaled-back spending targets would require the 
services to cut a total of about $160 billion from their earlier projections, 
which had assumed that the defense budget would rise by as much as 2% yearly 
after inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Under Cheney's new five-year budget, the Pentagon's request would rise from 
$295.1 billion in 1991 to $300 billion in 1992, $304 billion in 1993, $308 
billion in 1994 and $312 billion in 1995, Administration sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten away from the tried-and-true formula that has guided the 
preparation of five-year defense plans in the past -- that you always assume 
150% of what you'll get," said a senior Pentagon official involved in the 
sweeping review. 
</P>
<P>
The result, the official said, will be a more rational winding down than has 
resulted from the average 2% annual inflation-adjusted declines that Congress 
has imposed on the Pentagon since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney is expected to submit a detailed version of the five-year defense plan 
to Congress in April after outlining its scope when he forwards the Pentagon's 
1992 defense request, now set at $295.1 billion, to Capitol Hill on Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Defense officials said the new budget plan demonstrates that the Pentagon has 
come to view the changes in Eastern Europe as having caused a lasting reduction 
in the military threat faced by the United States and its allies. 
</P>
<P>
It also represents Cheney's willingness to engage Congress in what he believes 
are realistic budget discussions. "He has repeatedly said he's going to send up 
reasonable numbers that he thinks the market will bear," a senior defense 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
But many in Congress already have called for far deeper reductions and are 
likely to consider the proposed budget cuts marginal. 
</P>
<P>
Because more than 50% of the Pentagon budget traditionally has gone to defend 
Western Europe, many analysts have said that far greater savings are possible 
now that the military threat to Western Europe has declined significantly. 
</P>
<P>
However, some leading congressional Republicans have been quick to warn that 
Cheney's plans for budget shrinkage assume that the United States will complete 
arms agreements on conventional and strategic nuclear weapons in the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney has said that, as U.S. forces are scaled back, he will try to protect 
America's strategic nuclear deterrent, and he has vowed to maintain the 
pre-eminence of the U.S. Navy. At the same time, he has said that the Army's 
future role is "up for grabs." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Navy has warned that budget cutbacks and the likely reduction of 
40,000 sailors will force the early retirement of vessels from the U.S. fleet, 
including two battleships by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Defense sources said that the Long Beach-based battleship New Jersey and the 
battleship Iowa, which is based in Norfolk, Va., top the list of ships destined 
for mothballs. The Iowa was crippled by a massive explosion in one of its gun 
turrets last April. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy expects also to retire dozens of older frigates in the next several 
years. At the same time, the service is fighting proposals to scale back its 
fleet of 14 aircraft carriers, considered the backbone of the Navy, to as few 
as 11. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Air Force official said recently that, if Cheney demanded 2% annual 
budget declines, the service would be forced to terminate one of its five 
largest acquisition programs -- the C-17 cargo aircraft, the Milstar spy 
satellite, the advanced tactical fighter, the Amraam air-to-air missile or the 
B-2 bomber. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force, facing a cut of 100,000 airmen and women over the next five 
years, also has drawn up contingency plans to reduce by five its current force 
of 36 tactical fighter wings. Each wing includes about 72 combat jets. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new five-year plan, the Army is planning to cut its troop strength by 
17.6%. The service plans to recast itself substantially, retraining and 
re-equipping more of the remaining forces for rapid deployment to distant Third 
World conflicts, such as Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Army's plans, the service would maintain 15 divisions -- down from 
its current level of 18 -- and reduce the proportion of U.S. troops deployed 
abroad in such places as Europe, Korea and Panama. The 4 2/3 Army divisions 
stationed in Europe, for instance, would shrink to about two. 
</P>
<P>
Army planners are charting a course to shrink the service to about 75% of its 
current size by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cheney has said that high-technology defense research must be spared 
from deep cuts so that U.S. forces can modernize and rebuild quickly if the 
massive East Bloc threat to Western Europe re-emerges. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney hopes to keep funding for "Star Wars" missile defense research on a 
rising path, at least until the Pentagon is able to lay out deployment options 
for the President. 
</P>
<P>
The defense chief, who is one of the Bush Administration's leading skeptics on 
the prospects for lasting change in the Soviet Union, has told Pentagon 
planners that, in the near term, changes to U.S. forces must be "reversible."

Redoubt Volcano was quiet, but Alaska environmental officials labored over 
plans to prevent a major oil spill if more violent eruptions damage a nearby 
oil storage facility. Hot mud flows this week got as far as the Drift River 
facility, 22 miles north, but dikes surrounding the tanks prevented damage that 
might result in a spill, said officials at the Environmental Conservation 
Department, the Alaska Volcano Observatory and the Cook Inlet Pipeline Co.

Delta Air Lines said that it had received few cancellations since it disclosed 
a threat against its transatlantic operations. 
</P>
<P>
The airline said that only four dozen of 5,000 customers with reservations for 
transatlantic flights had canceled trips. Delta announced Thursday that it had 
received a telephone threat at its Dublin, Ireland, sales office, but the 
caller did not specify a flight, date or city. The airline said it notified the 
Federal Aviation Administration and took steps to increase security but that it 
believes the threat is a hoax. Delta flies to eight European cities from six 
U.S. airports, including Los Angeles International.

A former accountant for the Department of Housing and Urban Development pleaded 
guilty to one count of theft for allegedly embezzling $1 million from the 
federal government. Douglas R. Turner, 38, entered the plea in U.S. District 
Court in Denver as part of an agreement that called for three other theft 
counts to be dropped. Prosecutors say Turner used a government computer to 
transfer about $1 million from the HUD Section 8 rent-subsidy program to the 
bank account of a real estate company he owned.

PAROLED SLAYER HELD IN DEATHS OF EIGHT WOMEN

<P>
A paroled killer charged in the slayings of eight women was ordered held 
without bail Friday, and authorities said they have linked him to a total of 11 
killings committed during the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
The break in the serial slayings was "just a matter of luck," one of the police 
officers who had spotted the suspect's car from a helicopter said. 
</P>
<P>
After his arrest, Arthur Shawcross, 44, of Rochester made statements about the 
slayings and told police where to find three bodies, said Police Chief Gordon 
F. Urlacher, who refused to say if the suspect had confessed. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities had been investigating the deaths and disappearances of 16 women in 
the Rochester area since March, 1988. Urlacher and Monroe County Dist. Atty. 
Howard R. Relin said five of the slayings are not related to the others. 
</P>
<P>
"The number that we believe that he's responsible for was 11," Urlacher said. 
"We've said all along that we don't believe all these cases were related, and 
that's the way it turned out." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the women Shawcross is accused of killing were involved in prostitution 
and drugs, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Shawcross pleaded not guilty to eight counts of second-degree murder Friday in 
Rochester City Court. Judge John Manning Regan ordered him held without bail. A 
preliminary hearing was scheduled for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the eight cases in which charges were filed, the district 
attorney said evidence linking Shawcross to three other deaths will be 
presented to grand juries in Monroe County and neighboring Wayne County. 
</P>
<P>
Relin said Shawcross moved to Rochester in 1987, when he was paroled from 
prison. He had served 15 years for the 1972 strangling of 8-year-old Karen Ann 
Hill of Rochester, who was killed when she was visiting Watertown, 150 miles to 
the northeast. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the break in the serial slayings occurred Wednesday when officers 
in a helicopter were searching a park 12 miles east of Rochester where clothing 
of a missing woman had been found. The officers spotted Shawcross' car, then 
the body of another missing woman.

FDA OKS USE OF BOTULISM TOXIN FOR TREATMENT OF EYE DISORDERS 
</P>

The government on Friday approved a type of food poisoning bacteria for use as 
a treatment for crossed eyes and another eye disorder that renders its victims 
legally blind. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration said a sterile, purified botulism toxin was 
approved as an injection therapy to treat strabismus, or cross-eye, and 
blepharospasm, a muscle disorder that makes the eyes close involuntarily. 
</P>
<P>
"This is seen as the first successful treatment for both conditions," said Eva 
Kemper, an FDA spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
When eaten in improperly handled food, the toxin can cause botulism, or food 
poisoning, an ailment that can lead to paralysis or death. 
</P>
<P>
"However, in clinical studies, the injected form was used safely in thousands 
of men and women to weaken muscles that pulled an eye in or out, or to reduce 
spasms in muscles that pull the eyelid closed," the agency said in a written 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
"With the blepharospasm, patients are legally blind because they can't hold 
their eyelids open," Kemper said. 
</P>
<P>
Strabismus can be the commonly known cross-eye, in which the eyes look inward 
at each other, or wall-eye, in which they look out. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors would inject the drug, botulinum toxin type A, into muscles near the 
eye, not the eye itself, to aid in "turning off" the muscle, the FDA said. The 
injection would take effect in a day or two and would last for about three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
FDA approval requires product labeling that indicates it is not recommended for 
use for children under age 12 and an advisory to physicians that sedentary 
patients treated with the drug resume activity slowly. 
</P>
<P>
"At least two patients who had been incapacitated and sedentary because of 
their previous condition apparently over-exerted too quickly and died of 
cardiac collapse," the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
"The most common side effects are that some patients' eyelids may droop or 
their eyes may feel irritated," it said. 
</P>
<P>
The product, which will be sold as Oculinum, is expected to be available in 
about 30 days.

COURT VOIDS FIRST SMOKER-DEATH DAMAGE AWARD

A federal appeals court Friday threw out the nation's first damage award 
against a cigarette manufacturer in the death of a smoker. But the court gave 
her family a chance for a new trial on another aspect of its case against three 
tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
The $400,000 damage judgment had been issued in the case of Rose Cipollone of 
Little Ferry, N. J., who died of lung cancer at the age of 58 in 1984. She had 
smoked for 42 years. 
</P>
<P>
In its complex ruling, the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a U.S. 
District Court ruling that dismissed claims of Cipollone's family that the 
cigarette companies had failed to issue warnings about the risks of tobacco 
smoking after 1965, when a federal labeling requirement took effect. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the court reversed a jury's award of $400,000 against Liggett 
Group Inc., granted to Cipollone's husband, Antonio Cipollone of Lakehurst, N. 
J., on grounds that the company had violated an express warranty, or 
advertising promise, that its products were safe. 
</P>
<P>
But the family did win the right to a new trial against three firms on one 
aspect of the case. 
</P>
<P>
The court, in an opinion written by Judge Edward R. Becker, said Antonio 
Cipollone has "live claims" against Liggett and the other two companies, 
Lorillard Inc. and Philip Morris Inc., on grounds that they marketed the 
product knowing the risks of cigarette smoking. 
</P>
<P>
That "risk-utility" theory of liability involves whether the average user can 
easily recognize the risks of the use. The District Court had barred Antonio 
Cipollone's claim of "risk-utility" against all three. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the appeals court ruled that he could make additional claims 
against Liggett that had been denied in lower court. 
</P>
<P>
Cipollone had won in District Court on his contention that the tobacco 
companies promised through advertising that their products were safe, which 
resulted in the $400,000 award.

APPEAL CLAIMS REAGAN SHOULD HAVE TESTIFIED IN NORTH TRIAL

Oliver L. North's superiors, including former President Ronald Reagan, tried to 
cover up the Iran-Contra scandal, and Reagan should have been questioned on the 
matter at North's trial, lawyers for the former White House aide said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Reagan was in a position to testify, as no other witness available to 
North could," about whether the President authorized a cover-up of a 1985 
shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran, North said in a brief urging a federal 
appeals court to overturn his convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter told North that Reagan, at 
a Nov. 12, 1986, meeting, had not disclosed to congressional leaders his 1985 
authorization for the Hawk shipment, North testified at his trial. 
</P>
<P>
"That statement by Poindexter certainly provided a reasonable basis for 
concluding that Mr. Reagan had made clear that U.S. involvement in the Hawk 
shipment should not be disclosed to Congress," North's court filing said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell quashed North's subpoena for Reagan's 
testimony, saying the court record contained no proof the President had 
authorized North to break the law.

A Virginia judge on Friday suspended about half of the $64 million in fines 
levied against the United Mine Workers for illegal strike activities at 
Pittston Coal Group mines in three states. 
</P>
<P>
Russell County Judge Donald McGlothlin Jr. suspended $33 million of the fines 
imposed for activities such as blocking mine entrances and vandalism to 
vehicles crossing picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
The union and Pittston want to eliminate all litigation before a proposed 
contract is sent to the rank and file for a ratification vote. Last Monday, 
both sides emerged from marathon negotiations with a proposed agreement to end 
the nine-month strike.

The United States is prepared to provide up to $3 million to an international 
commission to begin planning the voluntary relocation of Nicaraguan Contras to 
their homeland if democratic conditions exist, it was announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said the funds would be given 
to a commission composed of United Nations and Organization of American States 
officials. The commission, known by its Spanish initials CIAV, was set up 
partly to oversee the dismantling of the Contras, most of whom are based in 
Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
"We have explained our intentions to the government of Honduras and the 
Nicaraguan resistance," Boucher said. "Both have reacted favorably. The U.N. 
and OAS secretaries general have also been informed." 
</P>
<P>
The commission, Boucher said, will be asked to submit proposals for use of the 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure was part of what appears to be an increase in diplomatic 
activity concerning the fate of the rebels as Nicaraguan elections draw closer. 
President Daniel Ortega will be running in the Feb. 25 election against an 
opposition slate led by Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Sandinista government said that Nicaraguan officials would 
meet today with Contra representatives in Tegucigalpa. CIAV officials also will 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
Amnesty for rebels willing to return in peace to Nicaragua will be discussed, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, State Department officials are expected to confer with CIAV 
officials at an undetermined location next week on the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Contras are at camps in southern Honduras. The five Central 
American presidents have called for the demobilization of the Contras, but the 
rebels, with U.S. support, have said they should remain intact until after the 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher's announcement of a conditional U.S. commitment to fund the 
demobilization of the Contras was in response to a communique approved by the 
five Central American presidents last month. 
</P>
<P>
According to some interpretations, the communique required the immediate 
transfer of all U.S. aid funds for the Contras to the CIAV. However, the State 
Department disputes that interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. aid to the rebels consists of food, clothing, shelter and medical services 
and is due to run out at the end of February. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas have given high priority to promoting the dismantling of the 
Contras, but the rebels have insisted that demobilization must be voluntary and 
in the context of a free and fair electoral process in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest setback occurred in early November when the Sandinistas, contending 
that the rebels engaged in terrorist activities, suspended a cease-fire that 
had been in effect informally with the Contras during the preceding 19 months.

Mike Harari, the former Israeli intelligence officer said to be the right-hand 
man of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, appeared on television here Friday and denied 
that he had any connection with the deposed Panamanian strongman. 
</P>
<P>
It was believed to be Harari's first such public appearance since the U.S. 
invasion of Panama on Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
He told an interviewer that there has been a massive campaign of 
"disinformation" against him, but he did not say by whom. 
</P>
<P>
"They said I was Noriega's adviser; I want to say I was not Noriega's adviser," 
he said. "I was not No. 1 or No. 2. Noriega was not my partner, I did not 
manage his trade, I did not direct or train his forces, I did not organize his 
personal bodyguard. I am simply a private person who deals in commerce." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, U.S. officials reported that American soldiers had captured Harari 
in Panama. But Harari said Friday that he slipped out of Panama as the U.S. 
invasion was getting under way. He denied that he had been helped by the 
Israeli Embassy in Panama or by anyone connected with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"I am here and not in the company of a blonde woman," he said, alluding to a 
report that a mysterious blonde had helped him flee. 
</P>
<P>
Harari is not wanted by law enforcement agents in the United States, but the 
new Panamanian government has indicated that it might want to try him in 
connection with crimes allegedly committed by Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Harari, 62, has been photographed in the company of Noriega. A few years ago, 
when Noriega visited Israel, Harari accompanied him on a tour of Israeli 
military bases, and Harari has served as honorary consul for Panama in Tel 
Aviv.

FEMALE'S WAR EXPLOITS OVERBLOWN, ARMY SAYS;

The Army said Friday that press accounts of a female commander's battle 
exploits in Panama, later repeated by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, 
were grossly exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
According to widely published accounts from Panama, Army Capt. Linda Bray, 29, 
led a force of 30 military police in a fierce three-hour fire-fight at a Panama 
Defense Forces guard dog kennel that left three Panamanian soldiers dead. 
</P>
<P>
The kennel, first thought to be undefended, was "heavily defended," Fitzwater 
said in a White House briefing Thursday. "Three PDF men were killed. Gunshots 
were fired on both sides. American troops could have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an important military operation," Fitzwater continued. "A woman led it, 
and she did an outstanding job." The incident, in the early hours of the Dec. 
20 invasion, has been generally accepted as the first time that a woman has led 
American troops in battle. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Army acknowledged Friday, the heavy gunfire lasted 10 minutes and 
no Panamanian troops were killed. Whatever Panamanian soldiers had been 
defending the facility faded into the woods, offering only "sporadic" sniper 
fire until disappearing into the night, an Army spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The facility and the surrounding area were secured at 3:30 a.m, a little more 
than two hours after the operation began. 
</P>
<P>
The original newspaper account of the action, distributed by Scripps Howard 
News Service, was widely repeated by other news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Bray was interviewed extensively by her superiors Friday after questions were 
raised in the Pentagon about press accounts of the kennel incident. She denied 
that she was the source of the more elaborate reports of the action, according 
to an Army general who spoke with her. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Friday, President Bush hailed the "heroic performance" of 
the American women who participated in the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama but said 
that he will reserve judgment on the future role of women in combat. 
</P>
<P>
Questioned about the participation of women in the invasion, Bush said that 
their original assignments were in noncombat duties, but "any time you have a 
highly trained, gung-ho volunteer force and they're caught up in some of the 
fire-fights that went on, a person can be . . . put into a combat situation." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Bray's and other Army women's actions in Panama, Rep. Patricia 
Schroeder (D-Colo.), said she would introduce legislation to allow women to 
serve in all military jobs, including combat, in a four-year experiment. 
</P>
<P>
The Army has about 600 female troops permanently stationed in Panama; another 
170, including Bray's 988th military police company from Ft. Benning, Ga., were 
sent to take part in the invasion. No American women were killed or injured in 
the fighting in Panama, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear how the inflated accounts of Bray's exploits began. According 
to the Scripps Howard story, Bray said that the three enemy dead were found at 
the scene later. But an Army spokesman, Gen. Bill McClain, said that Bray never 
reported any PDF casualties, nor did the Defense Department's Panama-based 
Southern Command, which ran the entire operation. 
</P>
<P>
"Your colleagues (in the press) must have reported that, from rumors," McClain 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Scripps Howard account also said that one of Bray's soldiers, Pfc. 
Christina Proctor, "single-handedly captured an enemy prisoner." According to 
Bray, however, when she counted her troops at the close of the operation, she 
had one more than she started with. The extra man was a frightened, unarmed PDF 
soldier who surrendered without resistance, she told the Army. 
</P>
<P>
McClain said that Bray was not even at the kennel when the shooting started. 
She was a half mile away at a command post. 
</P>
<P>
A White House official said Fitzwater based his comments solely on newspaper 
accounts. He had no independent verification of the incident when he spoke 
about it Thursday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. law and military regulations bar women from combat roles, although they 
serve in numerous support jobs -- such as transport and military police units 
-- that can bring them into the line of fire, as occurred in Panama. They are 
armed and trained to use their weapons and, like all U.S. soldiers, are 
authorized to fire to defend themselves.

SOUTH AFRICAN TELLS HOPE FOR TIES TO EAST EUROPE AFTER HUNGARY TRIP

Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, back from his first trip to Eastern 
Europe, said Friday that his government hopes to establish diplomatic relations 
with Hungary and possibly other long-hostile Warsaw Pact countries. 
</P>
<P>
Botha also said his government wants to attract Eastern Europeans to South 
Africa to ease a labor shortage in skilled jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-apartheid groups have denounced the recruitment campaign, saying the 
government should be training blacks rather than wooing white immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
In Budapest, Botha met Thursday with Hungarian Foreign Minister Guyla Horn. 
Hungary's national MTI news agency reported afterward: "Both sides expressed 
their intention to gradually establish official relations." 
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress, which for decades has received Soviet Bloc 
backing for its guerrilla campaign against white-minority-led rule, accused 
Hungary of betraying South Africa's black majority and forming "a racist 
partnership with apartheid." 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Nzo, the group's secretary general, said Hungary's decision to receive 
Botha demonstrated "bad faith and a cynical disregard for international 
agreements." 
</P>
<P>
"Only 10 days ago, representatives of the Hungarian government assured the ANC 
that they have no contact with the apartheid regime," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Botha told reporters before leaving Budapest that "no agreements were 
concluded" with Hungary. And Horn reminded Botha that Hungary "opposes any kind 
of racial, national or ethnic discrimination, and condemns all manifestations 
of apartheid," MTI said. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Friday at Johannesburg's airport, Botha said the two 
countries will investigate possible cooperation in trade, industrial 
development and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the prospect of formal ties with other Eastern European countries, 
Botha replied: "There is already contact, and we are talking." 
</P>
<P>
Botha's two-day stay was the first known visit by a senior South African 
official to a Warsaw Pact country.

BULGARIANS AGAIN PROTEST RIGHTS FOR ETHNIC TURKS

Strikes and mass protests by Bulgarians opposed to new freedoms for ethnic 
Turks paralyzed towns and cities across the country Friday. 
</P>
<P>
What started as a token two-hour stoppage in the southern town of Kurdzhali 
five days ago grew into a general strike that spread throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Shops and factories closed in Kurdzhali and the nearby town of Haskovo, as well 
as in Stara Zagora and Devnia, site of the country's biggest chemical plant. 
</P>
<P>
Strikes, some total and others symbolic, were reported in several towns in the 
northeast, including Targovite, Sumen and the Black Sea resort of Varna. There 
were protests also in Ruse near the border with Romania. 
</P>
<P>
The new Communist leadership, which last month restored to the Muslim Turks the 
religious and cultural rights denied them under former leader Todor Zhivkov, 
appealed for unity. 
</P>
<P>
"There can be no future in isolation. We have to live within Europe and 
preserve peace in the Balkans," National Assembly President Stanko Todorov said 
in a televised speech. 
</P>
<P>
Under Zhivkov, overthrown in November after 35 years in power, the nation's 1.5 
million Turks were forced to assume Bulgarian names and banned from practicing 
their religion. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the rise in nationalist sentiment, Todorov told the nation: "In 
Bulgaria, there will be only the Bulgarian flag, and the official language of 
Bulgaria is Bulgarian. This is in the constitution." But he added that the 
constitution also guarantees equal rights to all Bulgarians. 
</P>
<P>
He said Parliament will form a commission, headed by Communist Party leader 
Petar Mladenov, to discuss the matter with all concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Todorov's speech appears unlikely to appease the growing numbers who have 
joined the protests. Thousands of Bulgarians are planning a mass rally Sunday 
in Sofia to maintain pressure on the government to reverse its policy. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, tens of thousands of ethnic Turks were reported to have fled 
Bulgaria to escape persecution and ethnic unrest.

LOCAL COMMUNIST LEADER RESIGNS AFTER UNREST IN SOVIET AZERBAIJAN

The local Communist Party leader in the Nakhichevan region of Soviet Azerbaijan 
has resigned following violence along the border with Iran, a Soviet official 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The official reason given for Geider Isayev's resigning was his health. 
</P>
<P>
However, a regional Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ismail Agayev, left no doubt 
that the action resulted from the border unrest, which broke out New Year's 
Eve. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what is happening in Nakhichevan," Agayev said when asked why Isayev 
stepped down. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters are demanding the opening of border areas for cultivation and 
the establishment of easier contacts with Iran's northern Azerbaijan province, 
which is peopled by their ethnic kin, local officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet television Friday showed pictures of frontier installations destroyed in 
nearly a week of turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
The senior border guard in the region, V. Zhukov, told Soviet television that 
the border system has "practically broken down. It is impossible to maintain 
normal security." 
</P>
<P>
The region has been closed to foreign journalists. On Thursday, it was reported 
that the protests were calming down, but fresh reports Friday contradicted that 
account. 
</P>
<P>
In the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, local officials said 10,000 people 
demonstrated Thursday in support of the protesters in Nakhichevan. Other 
accounts gave higher figures. 
</P>
<P>
One local journalist said about 30,000 demonstrators gathered in Nakhichevan 
and then marched to the border and "ripped up what had not been destroyed Dec. 
31."

President Saddam Hussein on Friday proposed resuming peace talks with Iran, and 
he suggested that the long-hostile nations re-establish air links. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi president suggested that direct meetings between representatives of 
Iran and Iraq be held alternately in Tehran and Baghdad under the auspices of 
the U.N. secretary-general. He also said Iran and Iraq should exchange 
prisoners of war and open their borders to allow resumption of visits to 
Islamic shrines in both countries. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war ended Aug. 20, 1988, when both sides 
accepted a cease-fire based on U.N. Security Council Resolution 598. Peace 
talks stalled immediately over interpretation of terms of the resolution.

An outbreak of a flu-like respiratory virus that is especially harmful to 
infants is rapidly spreading in Orange County and has left four babies in 
intensive care on respirators at a local hospital, health officials said 
Friday. Although the disease -- respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) -- ordinarily 
is no more severe than a bad cold or influenza, doctors warned that it can 
progress into pneumonia or other potentially fatal diseases if left unchecked, 
especially in babies or children with chronic respiratory ailments. 
</P>
<P>
Some hospitals report treating twice as many children for RSV and other 
respiratory ailments this year. "We would definitely term it an outbreak, and 
it could go to an epidemic," said Marilyn Gallagher of Kaiser Permanente's 
Anaheim Medical Center. But in Los Angeles County, there is "nothing at all 
unusual" about this year's flu season, according to Frank Sorvillo of the 
county health department.

Three Vallejo men convicted of murder after going on a "gay-bashing" rampage in 
San Francisco five years ago were ordered freed from prison Friday. The 
defendants, whose murder convictions were reduced to involuntary manslaughter 
by an appeals court, were resentenced to time already served and ordered freed 
by Superior Court Judge Edward Stern. 
</P>
<P>
The judge reduced the 15-year-to-life terms for the men to eight years in 
prison, which made all three eligible for release after serving roughly four 
years. Timothy White, 26, David Rogers and Donald Clanton, both 24, were 
convicted of the 1984 murder of John O'Connell during an unprovoked street 
attack in San Francisco. But the 1st District Court of Appeals, on a split 2-1 
vote, ruled in November that the murder convictions had to be reduced to 
involuntary manslaughter because the defendants did not have the required 
"implied malice" to constitute a murder.

KILLER SAYS HE'S CHANGED, SEEKS REPRIEVE FROM DEATH

<P>
In a legal brief filed Friday, Robert Alton Harris has urged the California 
Supreme Court to overturn his death sentence, arguing that he has changed for 
the better in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to avoid becoming the first person to be executed in California since 
1967, Harris, convicted of the murders of two San Diego teen-age boys, said it 
would be cruel and unusual punishment to kill him after he had changed. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, whose case has progressed furthest through the court system of any of 
the more than 200 men on California's Death Row, also contended that the 
lengthy delay since he was condemned to die -- nearing 11 years -- has violated 
his rights and warrants a new sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from those two claims, the nine other reasons detailed in the 180-page 
brief were mostly technical requests for relief, Harris' lead attorney, Charles 
Sevilla of San Diego, said Friday. A few, however, were responses to the denial 
last September by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco of the 
earlier appeal Harris had filed, Sevilla said. 
</P>
<P>
If all of Harris' appeals are rejected, some death penalty experts have said, 
there is a chance he could die in San Quentin's gas chamber by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court is due to consider this month whether to hear Harris' 
earlier appeal, Sevilla said. However, the brief filed Friday will begin yet 
another round of appeals for Harris, as the case works its way through the 
state and federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court already has upheld key parts of Harris' 1979 trial, 
making it unlikely that the court will review his case, prosecutors said. The 
California Supreme Court, meanwhile, affirmed Harris' death sentence 10 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Harris was arrested July 5, 1978, by San Diego Police Officer Steve Baker, who 
did not know that earlier in the day Harris had murdered Baker's son, Michael, 
and Michael's friend, John Mayeski. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old boys had been eating their lunches in the parking lot of a 
Jack-in-the-Box in northern San Diego when Harris kidnaped them at gunpoint in 
a scheme to steal their car and use it in a bank robbery. 
</P>
<P>
He ordered them to drive to a canyon near Miramar Reservoir, where he killed 
them. Later, he ate their lunches. 
</P>
<P>
In the brief filed Friday, Harris argued that it violated his rights to kill 
him when he had become what one regular visitor called an "affable, extremely 
friendly and obviously well-liked" prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
Harris included in the brief 21 sworn statements from friends, other inmates 
and even guards at San Quentin saying he had mellowed in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other reasons Harris said he should not be put to death was "newly 
discovered" evidence of mental disorders that Harris claimed he did not know 
about when he was sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
The four alleged disorders -- including a claim of a post-traumatic stress 
disorder that does not involve military service -- were not presented at the 
trial and require neurological attention, Harris contended. 
</P>
<P>
Sevilla filed the brief Friday with an intermediate state appeal court in San 
Diego, under a special rule for the convenience of lawyers that requires the 
legal papers to be forwarded immediately to the state Supreme Court office in 
San Francisco.

BAN ON SALE OF AMMO BEFORE HOLIDAYS URGED; 
</P>
<P>
WEAPONS: PROPOSAL BY L.A. OFFICIALS SEEKS TO CRACK DOWN ON THE USE OF GUNS AS 
PARTY NOISEMAKERS.

<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley and two City Council members proposed Friday that the city 
ban the sale of ammunition for a week before New Year's Eve and the Fourth of 
July. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is an attempt to cut down on the deliberate firing of guns into 
the air, a practice that has come to characterize those holidays and has caused 
injuries and at least one death in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
During the week before the holidays, gun shop owners expand their hours to 
encourage ammunition sales, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
If the measure is approved by the City Council, Los Angeles would be the first 
city in the country to ban pre-holiday ammunition sales, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people are so terrified they won't leave their homes on New Year's Eve," 
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
To punctuate the point, Bradley played a tape recording that crackled with the 
sound of gunfire and wailing sirens. 
</P>
<P>
"That was not Vietnam nor was it Panama," Bradley said. "That was right here in 
South Central Los Angeles . . . a year ago. People firing their guns without 
any thought about what will happen when those bullets come down." 
</P>
<P>
This last New Year's Eve, Los Angeles police recovered 134 guns and arrested 75 
people for allegedly firing guns into the air, police said. More arrests were 
made this year than last, police said, but reports of shots fired in the city 
were down 43%. There were eight gunshot injuries in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley was joined at a press conference on Friday by Councilmen Joel Wachs and 
Richard Alatorre, who said they will introduce legislation to ban the 
pre-holiday ammunition sale and move it quickly through the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a $500 reward will be offered for information that leads to the arrest 
and conviction of anyone who fires a gun during the holiday periods, Alatorre 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of killing and violence is senseless," Wachs said. The proposed 
measure is not gun control, he said. "It's like stopping the sale of liquor at 
2 o'clock in the morning. There's a point in time when you just have to say, 
'No.' " 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the National Rifle Assn. in Washington and Sacramento were not 
available for comment on the proposal Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said Friday he believes the ban can withstand a legal challenge and 
said he will ask officials of other cities in the area to enact similar 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
One of the gun dealerships at issue is Western Surplus Stores, which had been 
asked a year ago to curtail its pre-holiday ammunition sales, but refused, 
according to Deputy Police Chief William Rathburn. 
</P>
<P>
The manager "told us he had a large inventory that he had ordered specifically 
because of the high level of sales around New Year's," Rathburn said. 
</P>
<P>
Al Campbell, manager of Western Surplus, denied Friday that the stores have 
ever been asked to curtail ammunition sales around holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been getting bad press as if we're a money-grubbing, unconcerned 
business," Campbell said. "How many guns have saved lives? Nobody looks at guns 
as a positive aspect." 
</P>
<P>
The stores stayed open on New Year's Eve "to satisfy customer demand," Campbell 
said, adding that many people came in to buy camping gear and warm clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said he would support the pre-holiday ammunition ban if it applied 
equally to all stores. "If that's the public demand, then I'm all for it," 
Campbell said.

FENCING IS PHYSICAL, INTELLECTUAL, ROMANTIC -- AND UTTERLY RELAXING

<P>
On a Tuesday evening at Westside Fencing Center in Culver City, longtime 
fencing partners Marc Walch and Frank Fox meet for a go-round of foil. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with tradition, they pause to "test" weapons -- a fleeting tap with 
the sword on the opponent's chest. Next the salute: Each draws his foil to his 
chin, resting it lightly. With steel mesh masks pulled forward, the fighting 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
What follows is the quick, subtle play of cat and mouse. The attack, parry, 
riposte, counterparry, fleche (sprint) and "touch" swiftly merge. A fencing 
director on the sidelines keeps score. In tonight's first round, Fox -- the 
first to score five points -- is the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Like Walch and Fox, athletes in clubs and schools throughout Southern 
California meet to share the many dimensions of this deadly combat skill that 
first developed into a popular sport in 14th-Century Europe. 
</P>
<P>
While few here have taken the sport as far as these two (Walch placed 12th 
nationally in 1989; Fox has ranked among the top 16 for a number of years), 
those who get beyond the first year of learning the mechanics contend that the 
struggle is well worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a lot of patience to learn," says Walch, 36, whose training began at 
age 11 in France. 
</P>
<P>
"You fence with literally a thousand different actions, and it takes a lifetime 
to learn them all," says the 6-foot electrical engineer who once a week matches 
wits with Fox and other veteran swordsmen. 
</P>
<P>
"Fencing helped me to discover who I am . . . It uses so much of you. Not just 
physically but also intellectually," he says. "Once you start having successes 
or defeats, you know what you can or cannot do." 
</P>
<P>
Fueled by the same passions, the shorter and lighter Fox, a 29-year-old 
attorney, fences nightly. His education in the sport began when he was an 
11-year-old student in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem is that I don't have top-level fencers to compete with. 
When I get Marc I'm thrilled. In Europe, you have a tournament every week in a 
nearby town or country, and the best go to tournaments," Fox says. 
</P>
<P>
Learning to adjust the body to an asymmetrical form becomes the first step of a 
fencer. One arm is thrust forward while the other is thrown back; one foot 
points forward, the other to the side. A perfectly balanced body travels on 
flexed legs, a motion that suggests the ballet. A year may pass before a 
student becomes comfortable with the motions of fencing. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, you feel a lot like a duck juggling," says Bill White, 45, 
an insurance executive who has been studying with Jack Akopyan at Los Angeles 
Athletic Club for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
"You know you've arrived when you're not thinking about every movement. It's 
just happening." 
</P>
<P>
The profuse sweat produced in a six-minute-or-less bout results from an intense 
collaboration of mind and body to achieve "the touch." 
</P>
<P>
"The physical content of the game is quite vast," says Ted Katzoff, director of 
Westside Fencing Center and a UCLA fencing coach. "You're using most of the 
muscle groups in the body, either on an isolated basis or in synchronization. 
It's not like an aerobics class, which has you constantly bouncing up and 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, a fencer spends from 40% to 60% of the time in blade and footwork 
drills and 20% to 40% in combat practice. Such ratios develop hand-eye 
coordination. 
</P>
<P>
"The constant mobility, change of motion, change of tempo over a period of time 
will tend to develop stamina, strength and physical discipline," says Katzoff. 
</P>
<P>
Age is only a minor consideration. A good example is 72-year-old Maxine 
Mitchell of Fontana, a four-time Olympian who won a gold medal at the Pan 
American Games in 1955 and retired from fencing a year-and-a-half ago after a 
hip transplant and a career that spanned 41 years. 
</P>
<P>
"They used to tease me because I hadn't lunged for the last 10 years," Mitchell 
recalls. "You actually set your opponent up and make him come to you. When your 
legs go, you start using your head." 
</P>
<P>
Fencing is sometimes compared to chess at 90 m.p.h., or to a high-speed video 
game. Any way you look at it, the play is fast. In the past 20 years, the 
increased speed of the game has called for electronic wiring of fencers in 
order to judge touches accurately. The fencers wear metallic cloth vests. Wires 
attached to each fencer's weapon are connected to the scoring box. A touch 
closes the circuit and causes colored lights to flash. Bouts are supervised by 
a director who applies the rules and awards the touches. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the three weapon styles -- foil, epee (pronounced epp-pay) and saber -- 
determine how the game is played. 
</P>
<P>
The foil is a modern version of the original training weapon. Touches are 
scored with the blunted tip on only the trunk of the body. The epee, too, is a 
point weapon, but whoever hits first, anywhere on the body, scores the touch. 
With the saber, a cut-and-thrust weapon, the entire upper body is a valid 
target area. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Richards, 59, has had a competitive fencing career that includes three Pan 
Am teams, three world-championship teams and one Olympic team (Tokyo '64). 
</P>
<P>
"People think this is a thinking sport. It is. But the thinking is 
subconscious," he says. "I've seen people lose bouts because they are thinking 
about what to do next. While you are thinking, the other guy hits you." 
</P>
<P>
What is not underestimated, however, is an alert savvy that guides the choices 
a fencer makes at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
"Fencing is a liar's game," Richards says. "I'm not going to accommodate you. 
I'm going to show you one thing, and when you really come, I'm going to do 
something else." 
</P>
<P>
Although 24 fencing medals are a significant statement of the sport's 
importance to the Olympics, the game has always had a negligible impact on the 
American sporting scene. It is not surprising that the results achieved by U.S. 
fencers at the '88 Olympics in Seoul, Korea, went largely unnoticed in a 
country preoccupied with gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
But when one considers that gold medals usually are won by countries that 
subsidize their athletes, the U.S. results were very positive, says Beverly 
Hills producer Carl Borack, captain of the U.S. Olympics team in '88 and 
captain of the U.S. world championship team. 
</P>
<P>
Worth noting, Borack says, was the sixth place captured by the U.S. women's 
team. So was the 11th place claimed by Kaitlin Bilodeaux of Montreal (fencing 
for the United States) in women's foil individual and the 12th place by Peter 
Lewison of Brooklyn in men's foil individual. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be a weekend or part-time fencer and compete with the top of the 
world," Borack says. "But given the fact that our athletes are truly amateurs, 
these are extraordinarily good results." 
</P>
<P>
In Culver City, the sign-up sheet for Al Couturier's Tuesday-night fencing 
lessons will probably keep him on his feet until midnight, but he doesn't mind. 
By fencing, the 5-foot silver-haired master recovered from the effects of 
osteomyelitis, a childhood disease that had severely weakened his legs. He 
can't move about as quickly as some, but his mastery of handwork technique has 
turned Couturier into a legend in the fencing world. Many nights, his students 
say, "no one can get near him." 
</P>
<P>
"Fencing has kept me very healthy," Couturier says. His salle (club) also 
boasts the women's national epee champion. And, he proudly declares, fencing 
"has also kept me from getting so stiff in my knees from arthritis that I would 
otherwise be walking on crutches. I'm 67 years old and this is my 25th year in 
teaching. I expect to be going until I'm 97." 
</P>
<P>
At the gymnasium of the Los Feliz Jewish Community Center, where members of the 
Los Angeles Fencer's Club meet, club coach George Radai and partner Chris 
Howell direct a program for high school fencers that was originally funded by 
the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles after the 1984 Summer Games 
</P>
<P>
Looking out onto the gymnasium floor bustling with boys and girls, Radai says: 
"Our students have been very happy with themselves because their performances 
have been so good. I went to a couple of these high school tournaments just to 
observe them fence. Some of them would come up to me and go, 'I have to fence 
this guy and I lost to him before. What should I do? What should I do?' I would 
say, 'First thing you should do is not do what you did before. Right? Change 
your strategy.' " 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the physical, intellectual and romantic aspects of fencing, there is 
something else -- something that has always appealed to Steve Goldman, 50, 
founder of the Venice Fencing Club. 
</P>
<P>
Once the No. 1 epee man on a small New England college NCAA team for three 
years running, Goldman explains: "As strenuous as fencing is, and as much 
concentration as it needs, it is utterly relaxing. It's a way of getting out of 
yourself and responding. Because the world goes away. It's a kind of mutual 
meditation. I call it meditations in steel."

L.A. AUTO SHOW FOCUSES ON GLITTER, PRACTICALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

General Motors may get the spotlight and come in for the most curtain calls at 
the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show when it opens today at the L.A. Convention 
Center. Subject of the hoopla is the introduction of a prototype electric 
passenger car. 
</P>
<P>
The Impact, which can go 124 miles on a single charge and even out-accelerate 
some internal combustion cars, was unveiled to the press Wednesday. Unlike 
other electric vehicles that are conversions of existing cars or vans, GM's 
version was designed from the ground up as a practical electric car for the 
consumer market. 
</P>
<P>
A teardrop-shaped two-seater, the Impact has a top speed of 75 m.p.h. and is 
powered by 32 10-volt lead-acid batteries. General Motors officials have said 
the car places GM "on the cutting edge of technology" and it could be on 
American roads by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Rivaling GM for attention will be 24 never-seen-in-North America production 
cars and 11 concept cars. All this is among the 650 late-model cars and 
specialty vehicles that will be on display. 
</P>
<P>
Auto shows have as much of their own style as the wide variety of glittering 
new cars. And in recent years, the L.A. show has come to be among the world's 
most prestigious, ranking with shows in other car capitals such as Tokyo, 
Paris, Frankfurt and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, concept cars -- or design studies, as they are sometimes called 
-- have been used at auto shows for publicity purposes and as elaborate 
business cards. 
</P>
<P>
What's changed for the '90s is that these futuristic vehicles lean more on 
practicality than ever before as manufacturers fight for niches in the world's 
most hotly contested car market. 
</P>
<P>
Among the concept entries this week are Subaru's SRD-1, Cadillac's Solitaire, 
Chrysler's Millennium, Oldsmobile's Aerotech III, Isuzu's 4200-H, the Dodge 
Viper, Ford's Splash, Buick's Lucerne convertible, Plymouth's Speedster, 
Pontiac's Stinger and the Porsche Panamericana. 
</P>
<P>
To maintain a low-pressure atmosphere, exhibitors agree to a no-sales policy. 
"What we try to do," says Jeanne Hoover, manager of sales promotion and 
merchandising for Mitsubishi Motor Sales, "is give the public as much 
information as we can. At the show, all of us encourage people to touch, sit in 
and look at just lots of cars. It's a terrific place to compare." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the exhibitors staff their displays with a combination of dealership 
and manufacturer personnel, who are usually selected for the assignment because 
they are especially knowledgeable about not only their own products but those 
of other manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Several companies, including Mitsubishi, offer sophisticated computer services 
so that interested consumers can print the manufacturer's suggested price lists 
to use later if they plan to visit a retail dealership. 
</P>
<P>
According to show manager Andy Fuzesi, most of the more than 500,000 people who 
will visit the show are potential buyers. "Of course, not everyone is in the 
market for a car when they actually come to the show," he says, "but, 
especially in Southern California, they will be sometime during the next few 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Many who attend the show are hard-core car buffs, people who want to know about 
anything and everything that's automotive. They visit the show to take in its 
vibrant atmosphere and enjoy the varied displays of vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Among cars making their North American debut in the L.A. show are (in no 
particular order): Avanti's elegant 4-door touring sedan; the long-awaited 
Lotus Elan; Mitsubishi's 3000GT; Buick's Park Avenue; Ford's Escort and 
Explorer; the Alfa Romeo Spider and 164; a Hyundai sports coupe, Chevrolet's 
new Caprice Classic, Beretta convertible, Camaro, four-door Blazer and Geo 
Metro convertible; Dodge's stunning Stealth; the completely restyled Toyota MR2 
and new Land Cruiser; BMW's new 850i; Oldsmobile's Bravada sport/utility 
vehicle; a Mercury Capri; Dodge's Shadow convertible; a Pontiac Firebird and a 
new Ferrari, the 348. 
</P>
<P>
And for the first time on the West Coast, Honda's Acura division will display 
its top-of-the-line mid-engined, two-seat sports car, called the NSX. This is 
the car Honda management hopes will unseat Ferrari and Porsche as the leading 
world-class production sports cars in the $60,000-and-up class. 
</P>
<P>
While the one-of-a-kind cars, debut models and sports cars get most of the 
attention, they are only a small part of an overall event that includes 
vehicles of all kinds: trucks, vans, antiques, racing cars, utility models, 
customs, and every family sedan, econo box and sport coupes (as opposed to 
sports cars) built just about anywhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Because of sold-out space limitations at the convention center, there is little 
room for accessory people, although two well-known automotive artists who work 
in different media will be in the main hall. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Collins, who elevated the lowly automobile floor mat to expensive art, 
also creates tapestries depicting some of the world's most exciting 
automobiles. None of his superb work is inexpensive, but then again there 
aren't many walls that wouldn't benefit greatly from his art. 
</P>
<P>
Collins will share exhibit space with automotive realist Harold Cleworth, who 
is among America's most popular and best-known automotive artists since moving 
here from the United Kingdom. Cleworth, who does paintings for car 
manufacturers and private customers in addition to creating posters, exhibits 
at the L.A. show mainly to meet people and autograph posters. 
</P>
<P>
Because the car business has become as hard-edged as a heavyweight boxing 
match, more manufacturers are touting their cars, trucks and vans as "task 
specific." That's a lofty way of saying vehicles will be advertised to specific 
groups. For example, what was "perfect for a family" may now be "perfect for a 
family with two blue-eyed, black-haired male children who travel with two cats 
and a West Highland Terrier." 
</P>
<P>
Emphasis on automotive muscle, speed and lots of horsepower will continue into 
the '90s. We can expect to see more super cars with prices to match and 
breathless claims for speeds in excess of 200 m.p.h. Already there are at least 
a dozen performance cars that can hit 150 m.p.h. right off the showroom floor. 
</P>
<P>
Electronics are also an increasing part of the automotive future, and it's 
anticipated the value of current electrical equipment (from about $500 per car) 
will triple by 1995. Look for navigational systems, microwave object detection, 
video mirrors, antitheft devices and keyless locks to join complex 
entertainment and diagnostic systems. 
</P>
<P>
Active suspensions that adjust automatically to road and driving conditions 
will become more common, as will antilock braking and electronic traction 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
All of these components and systems offer value (and cost) to consumers. 
However, the best news may be a statement from an automotive executive who 
said: "No matter what we do or how much we add, the only cars that really will 
be hot items are the ones that are fun to drive." 
</P>
<P>
Attending the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show is even more convenient than before 
with the addition of shuttle buses, supervised child care, a low price and 
hours that should suit everyone. 
</P>
<P>
The show runs from today through Jan. 14. Hours: Monday-Friday noon to 11 p.m. 
Saturdays: 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Sundays: 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Adult Admission: $5; 
children 12 and under free when accompanied by an adult. The L.A. Convention 
Center is at 1201 S. Figueroa St., off the Harbor Freeway. Call (213) 748-8531 
for general show information.

GRAFFITI ARTISTS IN SHOWDOWN ON FURNITURE WAREHOUSE WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For weeks, the street had rumbled with rumors that "Slick" and "Hex" were 
headed for a showdown. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, it erupted at an industrial, weed-choked site between the Levitz 
furniture warehouse and the Los Angeles River on the Glendale-Los Angeles 
border. 
</P>
<P>
At stake was nothing less than the title of graffiti king of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The battle -- which lasts until sundown on Sunday and involves judges and 
hard-core partisans on both sides -- will determine whose artwork rules the 
street. The winner will become part of the legend of "hip-hop," the popular 
urban subculture that blends elements of graffiti art, rap music, skateboarding 
and break-dance clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"Your pieces aren't immortal, so what's important is the feeling you get when 
you finish it and the knowledge you've touched even one person with your art," 
said Hex, a 21-year-old self-taught artist from Downey, as he sprayed 
salmon-colored paint on a freshly whitewashed wall. 
</P>
<P>
Hex, whose given name is Hector Rios, is no gang member. He gets his artistic 
inspiration from mythology, history and the Bible. His spray-can paintings are 
self-contained worlds complete with dragons, castles and other fantasy figures. 
Recently, he was commissioned to paint a giant Batman on the wall of a Melrose 
comic book store. 
</P>
<P>
His opponent, 22-year-old Slick, who lives in Baldwin Park and whose given name 
is Richard Wyrgatscht, favors cartoon-like figures that exude comic energy. At 
Pasadena's prestigious Art Center College of Design, where Slick studied 
illustration, professors praised his talent and potential. 
</P>
<P>
Much to the chagrin of some law enforcement officials, graffiti art, which 
started in New York subways during the 1970s, is embracing Los Angeles with a 
growing passion. The city's horizontal sprawl and abandoned industrial spaces 
provide numerous places to spray paint one's way into "hip-hop" legend. 
</P>
<P>
Painting on walls without permission is illegal, but some authorities and 
businesses are starting to draw distinctions between graffiti art and the 
scribbles that regularly defile RTD buses. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Levitz, which has been plagued by graffiti in the past, has 
granted permission for artists to use its back walls in hopes that the more 
visually pleasing works will keep away "taggers" who just scribble their names. 
</P>
<P>
Most aerosol artists say they are motivated by a desire to create, not destroy. 
What puts Slick and Hex ahead of the pack of an estimated 500 or more local 
graffiti artists is their talent at "piecing" -- slang for creating 
masterpieces. Both are skilled traditional illustrators. 
</P>
<P>
This battle is a rematch. Slick and Hex first crossed spray cans last fall in 
the old rail yard at Glendale Boulevard and 2nd Avenue near downtown Los 
Angeles. Because it ended without a clear winner, both artists are going for 
the jugular this second time around. 
</P>
<P>
Both have sketched the scenes and characters they will paint, but were leery of 
discussing their plans Friday morning for fear of tipping off their opponent. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Slick might paint a Superman, prompting Hex to paint a scorpion 
attacking Slick's Superman, prompting Slick to paint a hooded executioner 
blowing away Hex's scorpion. And so on. 
</P>
<P>
By early Friday afternoon, Slick, who had been at the Levitz warehouse since 6 
a.m., was kicking into high gear. 
</P>
<P>
On one end of the wall had materialized a goofy cartoon figure in flesh tones 
that represents the rival he jokingly refers to as "Hoax." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to draw a 'Hoax-in-the-Box,"' Slick vowed from high atop an aluminum 
ladder for those hard-to-reach spots. 
</P>
<P>
Farther along the wall where the Hex contingent had decamped, his opponent had 
a quick comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"Hoax?" Hex said, in tones of mock surprise. Then he offered to help Slick sign 
up for spelling classes. 
</P>
<P>
By late afternoon, Hex's mural also was taking shape: a haunted nighttime 
landscape where ravens perched on gnarled tree branches while a full moon rose 
in the background. 
</P>
<P>
As rap music blared, he took a break from the action and mused, "This is the 
greatest escape in the whole world. A lot of people went through a lot of pain 
to develop this art, and we're keeping it alive." 
</P>
<P>
The battle ends Sunday, when the winner will be picked by a team of judges who 
include "Delta," a noted New York graffiti artist, and Jim Prigoff, a 
self-styled graffiti expert who wrote the book "Spray Can Art."

SMOG-CHECK CHARGES FOR EQUIPMENT MOTORS CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Smog-check fees for equipment motors used by a variety of small businesses in 
Southern California were slashed from as much as $10,224 each to a flat $150 
Friday after a dozen businessmen told local air quality officials that the 
charges were bankrupting them. 
</P>
<P>
"I pay about $25 for the smog check on my car," Royal Foust, the operator of a 
small concrete-pumping firm in Lakewood, told the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District Board of Directors. "It would cost me more than $4,000 for 
the same sort of check on a smaller engine on one of my machines. Why the 
difference?" 
</P>
<P>
Even the AQMD staff, which had set the higher fees last June to replace a 
special one-year discount rate for the small businesses, acknowledged that the 
charges were sometimes "way out of line" and "could create an undue hardship" 
for some businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
Foust said it was more than a hardship. 
</P>
<P>
"I have nine of those machines," he said. "All told, it would have cost me more 
than $40,000. Cash. All at once. Not only would it have wiped me out, I 
couldn't even have gotten anyone to buy the machines." 
</P>
<P>
AQMD spokesman Bill Kelly explained that the high fee structure was an 
outgrowth of the agency's attempts to reduce emissions from large, industrial 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
"As we clamped down on the emissions from large companies, we found there were 
still substantial emissions from smaller operations," he said. "In June, 1988, 
the board changed the rules to require small businesses to get permits. We 
offered a one-year discount." 
</P>
<P>
Under the discount, most small businesses were charged a one-time application 
fee of $75, a one-time permit evaluation (smog-check and 
environmental-analysis) fee of $125 and an annual operating fee of $73 for each 
internal combustion engine not covered by Department of Motor Vehicles 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the fact that the permit-fee requirements were "well publicized," 
Kelly said, about 8,000 businesses covered by the new rules never filed. Many 
operators -- including Foust -- say they never heard about it. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, the board rescinded the discount and amended the rules, reinstating 
the same sort of fee structure for small businessmen that had applied to big 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
The one-time application fees for each motor ranged between $160 and $250. 
</P>
<P>
For motors up to five horsepower -- the sort used for a lawn mower -- the 
one-time permit evaluation fee was $174 and the annual operating permit fee 
$74. 
</P>
<P>
For motors between 65 and 124 horsepower -- the sort used by Foust -- the 
evaluation fee was $4,267, the annual permit fee $503. 
</P>
<P>
For motors of more than 400 horsepower -- the kind used for big pumps and 
generators -- the evaluation fee was $10,224, the annual permit fee $1,448. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I heard about it was when I saw it posted on the wall in 
someone's shop," Foust said. "I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly said the high fee structure, designed for big businesses, was meant for 
operations capable of polluting an entire neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a 500-horsepower engine operating 24 hours a day, the carbon 
monoxide and hydrocarbons can violate the air standards in the whole area," he 
said. "The fees were predicated on that sort of use." 
</P>
<P>
Foust said his use of much smaller motors was confined to a few hours each day. 
</P>
<P>
"What you had was some brilliant people over there (at the AQMD)," Foust said, 
"people who have no idea what's really happening outside the walls of that 
place." 
</P>
<P>
"We are not omniscient," Kelly said. "We found a lot of instances where you 
don't have to do the detailed engineering analyses (required for big industrial 
operations). Some of the fees were way out of line." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging this Friday, the AQMD staff presented the board with three 
options for reducing the fees for all businesses, two of which slashed the 
charges substantially. 
</P>
<P>
The board, by a vote of 10 to 1, opted for an amended version of the least 
expensive option -- a one-time application fee of $100, a one-time evaluation 
fee of $150 and an annual operating fee of $87, for any internal combustion 
engine of less than 500 horsepower. The lone "nay" vote came from board member 
Sabrina Schiller, who wanted a sliding scale of higher application fees. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly said refund checks will be sent to several thousand businessmen who paid 
the higher fees, but stressed that only a relative few had been billed for -- 
and made -- "big overpayments." 
</P>
<P>
Foust had not paid the higher fees, so he will not get a refund. 
</P>
<P>
But with the prospect of a vastly lower bill, he said he feels "a lot better 
now." 
</P>
<P>
"I'll still have a warp on my wallet," he said. "But I'll find a way to pay 
it."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY CUTS FILM FEES TO ATTRACT MOVIE MAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Monrovia City Council members, in a bid to lure Hollywood production companies 
to Monrovia's quiet streets, have approved an ordinance to cut filming fees by 
about two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
The first day of shooting will now cost $150 instead of $468, and charges for 
each additional day are down from $234.50 to $75. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment was prompted by a request from the California Film Commission, 
which is trying to promote film production in the state. The commission was 
created after California lost $3 billion worth of movie production to other 
states in 1988.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MCMARTIN JURY RETURNS TWO MORE SEALED 
VERDICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jurors in the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial Friday returned two more 
sealed verdicts, bringing to 34 the number of verdicts reached thus far and 
leaving 31 counts yet to be decided. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-man, four-woman Superior Court jury returned the two verdicts on the 
30th day of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
The jury returned six other sealed verdicts on Wednesday and 26 other verdicts 
before its vacation the last two weeks of December. The jury must now reach 
verdicts on 31 other counts. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge William Pounders has said that, as long as he is satisfied 
the jury is making progress in its deliberations on the remaining counts, he 
will not unseal and finalize the verdicts until all of them are returned. 
Former Manhattan Beach preschool teachers Raymond Buckey, 31, and his mother, 
Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, are charged with one count of conspiracy and 64 
counts of child molestation.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN INDICTED IN COMPUTER BOOKMAKING SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Agoura man was indicted Friday in Las Vegas on charges he headed the 
"Computer Group," a nationwide betting ring that netted millions in profits 
before it was shut down by the FBI on the eve of the 1985 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities unsealed an indictment charging Ivan Mindlin, 61, with 
managing the group and hiring individuals who placed bets on its behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Charges against Mindlin and 18 others include conspiracy, interstate 
transmission of betting information and use of interstate facilities in aid of 
racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
The betting ring was dubbed the "Computer Group" because members allegedly 
designed a computer program that was fed information on a sporting event to 
determine the betting line. The group then set up representatives in various 
cities to bet various events, using the computer-generated lines to determine 
the bets.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOULD-BE ROBBER LEAVES BOGUS BOMB IN BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fake bomb left on a desk by a would-be robber forced the evacuation Friday of 
about 20 people from a Security Pacific National Bank branch in Hollywood, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed casually in a sport coat and polo shirt, a man entered the bank in the 
7600 block of Sunset Boulevard about 2 p.m. and asked for a $35,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
After discussing the loan for a half hour with a bank employee, the man pulled 
out a red box and threatened to blow up the bank unless he got the money, said 
Detective Lt. Bob Ruchhoft. 
</P>
<P>
The man fled when the employee went to the bank vault. No money was taken and 
employees were allowed to return in about an hour. Police found crumpled 
newspapers in the box.

SUPERIOR COURT JUDGES LASH ACLU OVER JAILS; 
</P>
<P>
OVERCROWDING: RIGHTS GROUP ACCUSED OF 'PERVERSE' LEGAL CAMPAIGN IN EFFORT TO 
SOLVE SITUATION IN L.A. COUNTY LOCKUPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Launching their strongest broadside in a continuing war of words with the ACLU 
over jail overcrowding, Los Angeles County Superior Court judges have charged 
the civil liberties organization with engaging in a "perverse and 
insupportable" legal campaign that borders on "harassment." 
</P>
<P>
The strong language is contained in a 17-page report sent this week to federal 
Judge William P. Gray, who has presided over a decade-long series of lawsuits 
filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California concerning 
County Jail overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the suits, initially filed 15 months ago, the ACLU has taken the 
101-judge group first to federal court and then to state appeals courts to 
demand that the judges stop granting so many delays in criminal cases. The 
delays, the ACLU says, have a direct impact on the horrific state of 
overcrowding in the county's jails. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the state Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from the ACLU of 
a state appellate court ruling refusing to order the Superior Court judges to 
change their policies for granting continuances. 
</P>
<P>
But the ACLU, in its own report to Gray, indicated that it will continue to 
pursue the case through the state Superior Court system and, if need be later, 
in federal court again. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU has contended that Superior Court judges are failing to follow a 1985 
state law that requires them to hold formal hearings on requests for 
continuances and to issue formal findings that trial delays are warranted only 
when there is "good cause." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Friday, Superior Court Presiding Judge Richard P. Byrne said 
the prime concern of his judges in granting delays is whether good reasons 
exist. 
</P>
<P>
"Writing it down is not as important as good cause itself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In their 17-page report, the Superior Court judges called "the ACLU's 
continuing campaign against the Los Angeles Superior Court . . . perverse and 
insupportable." 
</P>
<P>
"The lack of any factual or legal support for the threat to 'reinstate' the 
federal action suggests that any further litigation by the ACLU would be mere 
harassment," continued the report, written on behalf of the judges by attorney 
Richard Schauer. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne said Friday that the report's language was blunt because, "you do arrive 
at a point where you feel the issue has really been decided, and that's where 
we are now." 
</P>
<P>
Byrne suggested that the ACLU fight jail overcrowding by lobbying for more 
judges and courtrooms, rather than by criticizing those already on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
But ACLU attorney John Hagar countered in an interview Friday that stricter 
adherence to the state law in granting continuances would result in "an 
efficient court system which helps people accused of crimes and also the 
victims of crimes." 
</P>
<P>
Hagar added that the judges' tough language is "a note of desperation on their 
part." 
</P>
<P>
"They want to resolve this difficult public question through innuendoes and 
threats. People shouldn't threaten the ACLU. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need 100 judges mad against us. . . . But I do believe we are right," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Recent studies show that Superior Court judges are disposing of more cases than 
ever, according to the judges' report. During the fiscal year that ended in 
June, 1989, the court's criminal dispositions rose 15% above the previous 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
However, criminal complaints also climbed 13.1% during the same period. Jail 
overcrowding continues at an alarming rate. 
</P>
<P>
During holiday periods, the population in the county's 10 jail facilities has 
surged as much as 800 prisoners over the longstanding limit of 22,388 imposed 
by Judge Gray. The state-rated capacity for the county's jails is only 13,464. 
</P>
<P>
Since May, 1988, more than 100,000 convicted misdemeanor inmates have been 
released anywhere from 15 to 37 days early in order to ease the overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
But efforts to build new jail space near downtown Los Angeles have met 
neighborhood resistance. In addition, a new 2,800-prisoner, high-tech jail 
complex near Castaic, which was due to open last spring, remains unopen because 
the toilets will not flush and the security doors will not shut properly.

MUSLIMS TELL THEIR SIDE OF VIOLENT CLASH WITH L.A. OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A violent clash between 13 members of the Nation of Islam and 24 police 
officers in Southwest Los Angeles this week stemmed from the Muslims' refusal 
to lie face down in a parking lot, an order they felt to be demeaning and 
unnecessary, a community activist close to the Nation of Islam said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Blows were exchanged between the Muslims and the officers only after one police 
officer attempted to put a chokehold on one of the Muslims in an apparent 
attempt to force him to the ground, said Chilton Alphonse, a non-Muslim 
anti-gang activist. Alphonse did not witness the incident but, after learning 
of it, he arranged a meeting between top officials of both the Nation of Islam 
and the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Once they were subdued, said Alphonse, the 13 Muslims, including two 
teen-agers, were "handcuffed and beaten with night sticks because they refused 
to fall to the ground like animals." One of the 13 was booked on suspicion of 
assaulting a police officer. The rest were booked on suspicion of "lynching," 
or trying to take a prisoner from a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials have denied most elements of Alphonse's version of the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Alphonse gave the Muslims' version of what happened at a news conference Friday 
afternoon, called by Nation of Islam officials to give their account of the 
clash. The incident occurred about 5 a.m. Wednesday in a store parking lot at 
Crenshaw Boulevard and Vernon Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Alphonse gave this account of the incident, based on his discussions with the 
people involved: 
</P>
<P>
The Muslims, traveling in a caravan of three cars, had been followed for nearly 
four miles by police after they left a nearby home on their way to a gym on 
Crenshaw just south of Vernon. Alphonse did not offer an explanation of why the 
men thought police were following them. At one point, officers pulled alongside 
their vehicles and flashed lights in their faces, Alphonse said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Rich Molony, a supervisor at the Police Department's Southwest Division, 
said he doubted that the Muslims had been ordered to lie down. 
</P>
<P>
"The only time we use the felony prone position is when we feel we're in a 
situation where our life is in danger," Molony said. "The officers had only 
asked the driver of the car they stopped to step over to the side with his 
hands up so we could see them." 
</P>
<P>
Police have maintained that the clash was precipitated by one of the Muslims 
who repeatedly interfered as officers tried to write a ticket during a routine 
traffic stop. When police attempted to arrest the man they say was interfering, 
he tried to hit one of the officers, Molony said, and "his friends joined in 
and the fray was on." 
</P>
<P>
At Friday's news conference, a representative of Nation of Islam leader Louis 
Farrakhan had been scheduled to make a statement about the incident, along with 
some of the men involved in the clash, but those portions of the program were 
abruptly canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Minister Wazir Muhammad, western regional representative for the Nation of 
Islam and head of the group's Los Angeles mosque, said the cancellation was 
made because Farrakhan's representative, Khallid Muhammad, had uncovered new 
information about alleged brutality and cover-up by the Police Department. He 
declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
During the news conference outside a restaurant half a block from the site of 
the incident, about 250 members of the Nation of Islam and their supporters 
listened as officials of the group and others decried what they described as 
widespread disrespect for black men by los Angeles police. 
</P>
<P>
Actor and former football star Jim Brown, who said he has had a "30-year 
friendship with the Nation of Islam," told the crowd: "We are people. We are 
human beings. We demand equal respect." 
</P>
<P>
Alphonse said black men, sometimes in groups, are forced by Los Angeles police 
to lie down in the street and submit to questioning "on a daily basis." 
</P>
<P>
Those at the news conference described the practice as intentionally 
humiliating and called for police to end it.

150 IN BEVERLY HILLS PROTEST MALATHION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wearing gas masks and waving signs, about 150 people chose an exclusive Beverly 
Hills neighborhood Friday evening to demonstrate against the aerial pesticide 
spraying used to combat the worst Mediterranean fruit fly infestation in 
Southern California history. 
</P>
<P>
Passing cars on Santa Monica Boulevard and Rodeo Drive honked as actors, 
singers and the mayor of Monterey Park protested. 
</P>
<P>
Their signs read: "Stop Spraying Us With Poison," "Malathion Bug Off" and 
"Downey Says No to Nazi Nerve Gas." 
</P>
<P>
The event was organized by Valley Citizens Against Urban Spraying and was 
attended by residents of Temple City, Sherman Oaks, Lakewood, Northridge and 
Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills was chosen for the demonstration because residents of the wealthy 
city have not been sprayed after receiving an initial application of malathion 
late last year, said Michael Bell, an actor and one of the event organizers. 
Bell alleged that Beverly Hills had successfully blocked further sprayings. 
</P>
<P>
But agricultural officials said the city was not sprayed again because no more 
fertile Medflies were discovered in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators from a variety of environmental and community organizations 
described becoming ill with headaches and flu-like symptoms after sprayings 
took place in their neighborhoods. The sprayings are now occurring every three 
weeks over the 300-square mile Medfly infestation area. 
</P>
<P>
Officials battling the Medfly infestation say the amounts of pesticide being 
sprayed are far too small to adversely affect people or animals. But the 
demonstrators were unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park Mayor Patricia Reichenberger said her son, who was recovering 
from head injuries suffered in a motorcycle accident, experienced severe pain 
after going outside the day after spraying. She said her son's doctor 
attributed the pain to "an environmental reaction." 
</P>
<P>
In another development, the state of Florida has agreed to send agricultural 
experts to California to help in the eradication effort.

DELTA FACES $70,000 FINE OVER 'UNAIRWORTHY' JET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration has proposed to fine Delta Air Lines 
$70,000 for operating an "unairworthy" airliner with a rudder problem on a 
flight from Fresno to Los Angeles about six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, what they did was fly the airplane -- a Boeing 727 -- with one of 
its two rudder systems inoperative," said Fred Farrar, FAA spokesman in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The plane took off from Fresno on June 17 with a Reno-bound flight plan and 
landed safely in Los Angeles without incident. But, Farrar said, the pilot 
failed to notify officials that Delta Flight 1575 had altered its plan and was 
heading instead for Los Angeles -- leaving FAA officials guessing. 
</P>
<P>
"We were looking at it as a possible hijack," Farrar said. 
</P>
<P>
After investigating the circumstances, the FAA said it notified Atlanta-based 
Delta of the proposed fine last month. 
</P>
<P>
The agency also said it wants to revoke the operating certificates of the pilot 
who flew the plane and the dispatcher who permitted the flight to continue. The 
names of those involved were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Delta declined to elaborate on the FAA's action. 
</P>
<P>
"It's premature to say anything at this time since we are in discussions with 
the FAA," spokeswoman Jackie Pate said Friday. "It is a proposed penalty. It 
could change as it is reviewed." 
</P>
<P>
An FAA spokesman said the agency did not know how many passengers were on 
Flight 1575 on the day of the incident. According to Farrar, even if the plane 
were flying without passengers, the procedures followed by the flight crew 
would have violated FAA regulations governing the safe operation of the 
airliner. 
</P>
<P>
He explained that the 727's rudder is in two sections -- top and bottom -- 
operated by separate hydraulic systems that provide backup if one section fails 
in flight. Taking off in the plane with one rudder inoperative could be 
hazardous, Farrar said, "because in a heavy crosswind it would be hard to 
control the airplane. 
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, if you had an engine failure on takeoff, you'd need all the rudder 
you could get to control the asymmetrical thrust of one engine working and one 
not working. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have been different. If an engine had failed on takeoff, it might not 
have ended so routinely," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the FAA, the pilot discovered the plane's mechanical trouble 
during taxiing just before takeoff and spent 20 to 30 minutes in an 
unsuccessful effort to correct the problem. The crew apparently was in contact 
with Delta's repair and dispatch facility in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"The captain and the dispatcher then devised a course of action to take off the 
aircraft from Fresno with a flight plan . . . with no intent to fly to Reno but 
instead on takeoff to immediately divert to Los Angeles because of the 
mechanical discrepancy," the FAA said. 
</P>
<P>
Farrar noted that Delta has repair facilities in Los Angeles but not in Reno. 
He speculated that the apparent motive for changing the plane's destination 
without notice was to fly the airliner to Los Angeles, where it could be 
repaired. 
</P>
<P>
If Delta can demonstrate that there were mitigating circumstances, the FAA 
could reduce its proposed penalty, but, Farrar added, "we don't have to." He 
said that if the airline refuses to accept the proposed penalty it can appeal 
the fine to the National Transportation Safety Board.

JUDGE QUESTIONS KEATING INTENSELY IN LINCOLN CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Under intense questioning from a federal judge, beleaguered Arizona businessman 
Charles H. Keating Jr. denied Friday that he engaged in sham transactions while 
operating Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, arguing that regulators never understood 
the deregulation laws that allowed his unorthodox business strategy. 
</P>
<P>
The remarks came in an unusual court proceeding in which U.S. District Judge 
Stanley Sporkin, a former enforcement chief at the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, personally handled the questioning of Keating. Government lawyers 
were silent as Sporkin spent many hours asking Keating about his business and 
accounting practices. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, Sporkin's tone was matter-of-fact and businesslike, but at times the 
questioning became quite pointed. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying about his strained relations with federal savings and loan 
regulators, Keating told Sporkin that "if they would have left us alone, we'd 
still be making $100 million a year." 
</P>
<P>
Keating blamed regulators for insinuating themselves in the business operations 
of Lincoln and other thrifts across the country, causing losses that he 
estimated will cost taxpayers $500 billion to $1 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials have projected that the industry bailout will cost 
taxpayers more than $200 billion, with Lincoln being the single biggest loss at 
more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's testimony came as the government closed its portion of a hearing 
called by Sporkin to test the accuracy of records that regulators relied upon 
to justify their April 14 takeover of the Irvine thrift. 
</P>
<P>
The court hearing has focused on four transactions identified by regulators as 
typical of the failure of Lincoln's former parent firm, American Continental 
Corp., to operate the S&amp;L safely and soundly and conserve assets. 
</P>
<P>
After acquiring Lincoln in 1984, Keating transformed it from a traditional 
thrift into a high-flying S&amp;L that planned to build entire communities on 
raw land, traded in stocks and high-risk junk bonds, and joined in corporate 
takeover attempts. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection April 13, the day before 
the federal seizure. The company sued regulators a week later, claiming that 
they lacked sufficient evidence to show that Lincoln was being operated 
unsafely and unsoundly and was substantially dissipating assets, the grounds 
cited for the takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Sporkin is the first judge to review the merits of some of the longstanding 
differences between regulators and American Continental executives over the 
operation of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
In one dispute, the government has alleged that a tax-sharing agreement under 
which Lincoln forwarded funds to American Continental to pay its share of the 
parent company's tax bill was a subterfuge to move $94.8 million from the 
thrift to the parent. 
</P>
<P>
But Keating rejected the charge. "With all my heart and soul I categorically 
deny that," he said. "I had no concept remotely related to that." 
</P>
<P>
Keating said he simply suggested that the company look into a tax-sharing plan, 
which is a common arrangement between holding companies and their subsidiaries. 
Other executives completed the arrangement, he said, and he never paid much 
attention to it. 
</P>
<P>
Sporkin seemed particularly interested in the accounting documentation for a 
$14-million sale of 1,000 acres of Arizona desert owned by Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Keating testified that he negotiated the deal with Tucson developer Ernest C. 
Garcia. Lincoln records, however, show that another firm, Westcontinental 
Mortgage &amp; Investment Co., put down $3.5 million down and took title to the 
property, agreeing to pay Lincoln $10.5 million more over time. 
</P>
<P>
Transferring title to Westcon without any reference in the S&amp;L's files to 
Garcia's role "hides" the true relationship and the true owner, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is one thing I think the regulators can insist on," Sporkin said. 
"Whatever the transaction is, it should be accurately reflected on the books." 
</P>
<P>
Regulators contend that the deal was a sham because Lincoln provided a series 
of loans to Garcia, and he used part of those proceeds to lend the $3.5 million 
down payment to Westcon. 
</P>
<P>
The result, they allege, is that Lincoln booked a profit on a sale in which it 
provided all the money for the transaction, a violation of accounting rules. 
That profit, in turn, resulted in Lincoln transferring money to the parent 
company under the tax-sharing agreement. 
</P>
<P>
After his testimony, a beaming Keating contended that the government has failed 
to prove that it had sufficient grounds to seize Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
"They took away an association with $5.5 billion in assets, and they're 
supposed to have some reasons," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental will present its side of the case when the hearing 
continues at an unspecified date. 
</P>
<P>
But James P. Murphy, an attorney for the Office of Thrift Supervision, the 
nation's chief S&amp;L regulatory body, seemed equally pleased with Friday's 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"What Keating described was the structure of a high-risk operation, not a 
savings and loan," Murphy said. "He showed his antipathy for regulation and his 
readiness to call any regulator who pins him down 'biased.' " 
</P>
<P>
He noted Keating's testimony that he considered eliminating Lincoln's network 
of 29 branch offices servicing traditional customer accounts and replacing them 
with sales of $100,000 jumbo certificates of deposit brokered by investment 
houses such as Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
Such deposits have been highly criticized by regulators because they pay 
relatively high interest rates and because brokers are likely to move them 
quickly to another S&amp;L paying even higher rates. But Keating said he was 
able to lock in the deposits for longer periods, thereby reducing the risk of 
investor flight. 
</P>
<P>
The lively courtroom exchange between Sporkin and Keating covered topics 
ranging from the businessman's background in Cincinnati and Sporkin's days at 
the Securities and Exchange Commission to details on the specific allegations 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Keating said his firm bought Lincoln in early 1984 because he saw an 
opportunity under newly passed deregulation laws to expand American 
Continental's land development projects, most of which were located in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
But later that year, as regulators started restricting thrift operations they 
felt were harming the deposit insurance fund, he spoke out publicly against the 
new rules. For that, he said, he was targeted for harassment. 
</P>
<P>
"The power of the government is awesome," he said, as Sporkin smiled and nodded 
in apparent agreement. "When you don't comply (with a rule), you become subject 
to an audit," Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
He said regulators made "horrendous" claims on the S&amp;L's time and resources 
and required Lincoln to reduce the value of assets they did not understand, he 
said.

FORD LIKELY TO SEEK BUYER FOR NEWPORT BEACH DEFENSE UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ford Motor Co. is preparing to put its Newport Beach-based aerospace division 
up for sale in a move that will come before the board of directors as early as 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
The possible sale of the unit comes amid increasing concerns about the 
financial future of the defense industry, which is confronting major budgets 
cuts as U.S.-Soviet tensions ease. In addition, the Ford Aerospace operation 
has not been meeting its profit objectives set by Ford Motor headquarters in 
Dearborn, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Industry sources speculated that Ford Aerospace would be purchased as a single 
entity but then broken up and sold as separate pieces. The operation includes a 
major missile manufacturing operation, a commercial satellite manufacturing 
operation and various defense service organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The company has purportedly prepared a prospectus for the sale of the operation 
but industry sources said the prospectus has not yet been circulated. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach-based Ford Aerospace Corp. has an estimated $2.5 billion in 
annual revenue and 17,000 employees. It is uncertain what price Ford might seek 
for the aerospace division. 
</P>
<P>
Ford would not comment on speculation that Ford Aerospace is for sale. 
Spokesman Bill Peacock said, "I think we're all aware that there is a lot of 
speculation about the retrenching in the defense industry. But we're not 
commenting on specific pieces (of reporting." 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler announced recently that it would sell its defense business, but 
General Motors has said it has no intention of disposing of Hughes Aircraft 
Co., its defense unit. 
</P>
<P>
A possible sale of Ford Aerospace was first reported in Washington Technology 
magazine on Dec. 21. The San Jose Mercury News later quoted the head of Ford's 
satellite operations in Sunnyvale as saying he was not aware of a possible 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
A senior official at a competing missile manufacturer said Ford Aerospace had 
not met profit objectives set by the parent company and had lost a major 
competition last year for a missile program known as the Advanced Anti-Armor 
Weapon Medium. The winning team was Martin Marietta and Texas Instruments. 
</P>
<P>
A move by Ford Motor to get out of the defense business would fly in the face 
of Ford Aerospace's $425-million acquisition just over a year ago of BDM 
International, a Virginia-based defense contractor involved in research for the 
"Star Wars" anti-missile program, whose prospects are also uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most controversial of Ford Aerospace's programs was the Sgt. York, 
an armored vehicle also known as DIVAD. The program was canceled by former 
Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger in August, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The cancellation came after the Pentagon had spent nearly $1.5 billion on the 
Sgt. York but then determined that the vehicle, equipped with radar and two 
guns, was ineffective at its task of defending Army tanks and troops from 
low-flying enemy aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the cancellation appeared to be a major blow to the Ford 
subsidiary and the parent firm's participation in the defense business. The 
program employed 1,900 people in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
But the information provided later by sources made it seem as if the government 
did Ford a big favor. Just before the cancellation, Ford was internally 
projecting that it would lose more than $200 million on the Sgt. York program, 
according to sources. As a result of the cancellation, Ford substantially 
reduced its projected losses. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's Newport Beach plant has a work force of about 3,000, and the company 
employs about 4,500 others at its centers in Palo Alto, Sunnyvale and Mountain 
View. 
</P>
<P>
In a December, 1988, interview, Ford Aerospace President Donald Rassier said 
the company was forecasting a growth in sales of between 10% and 12%. The 
company had contract awards of $1.3 billion in 1988. No figure was available 
for 1989.

OPEC Output Expected to Remain Strong: OPEC oil output hit a 1989 monthly high 
of 23.6million barrels per day in December and likely will remain strong in 
early 1990 despite a new production-cutting accord, a Reuters survey shows. 
December output by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was about 
50,000 barrels per day greater than November's 23.55 million barrels, according 
to the survey. Extreme cold in the United States pushed prices up sharply in 
late 1989, but analysts cautioned that prices here have probably peaked for the 
year.

OPEC oil output hit a 1989 monthly high of 23.6 million barrels per day in 
December and likely will remain strong in early 1990 despite a new 
production-cutting accord, a Reuters survey released this week showed. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see how they will cut back with oil prices as high as this," one 
industry executive said. "If anything, they are more likely to do the 
opposite." 
</P>
<P>
December output by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was about 
50,000 barrels per day greater than November's 23.55 million barrels, according 
to the survey, based on information gathered from oil industry, official and 
shipping sources in the Middle East, Europe and the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
An exceptionally cold spell in the United States pushed prices up sharply in 
late 1989. In the United States, industry analysts cautioned that the party is 
nearly over and prices have probably seen their peaks for the year. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, energy futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange ended sharply 
lower Friday after a day of sustained profit-taking turned into a frenzied 
sell-off just before the close. 
</P>
<P>
"Under normal conditions, we've probably seen the top of the range," said John 
Redpath at Energy Security Analysis Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's a high for the year at that point," added Morris Greenberg, 
director of energy services at WEFA Group Inc. "After all, we've had abnormal 
circumstances to get where we are now." 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices had gained on the rally in heating oil, which soared last week 
to its highest since January, 1984, on bitter cold weather. Demand for crude 
also rose as refiners pumped at peak capacity to cash in on strong heating oil 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
But heating oil's strength is waning, analysts said, and lower refiner demand 
will coincide with ample supplies from expected OPEC overproduction in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I see it, with not enough demand, too much supply and no OPEC 
discipline, prices go down," said David Knapp, an economist at Brown Bros. 
Harriman. 
</P>
<P>
The OPEC production agreement in force at the time had set a ceiling of 20.5 
million barrels per day in a bid to keep prices up. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are now at four-year highs of around $20 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
OPEC ministers agreed last November to raise the ceiling from Jan. 1 to 22.1 
million barrels per day to take account of growing demand.

DECEMBER UNEMPLOYMENT RATE UNCHANGED AT 5.3% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The economy's recent slowing continued in December with the creation of only 
142,000 new payroll jobs -- 55,000 of them going to telephone workers returning 
to work after a strike -- while unemployment remained unchanged at 5.3%, the 
Labor Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the softening in job growth was attributable to an abnormally cold 
early winter, which knocked 38,000 construction jobs off the rolls. The 142,000 
new jobs compared to November's total of 222,000. 
</P>
<P>
Factory jobs fell by 25,000 in December, the ninth consecutive monthly decline 
and a sign of a continuing contraction. Altogether, the U.S. economy shed 
195,000 factory jobs from March, the last month in which factory jobs 
increased, through December. 
</P>
<P>
In California, civilian unemployment in December was estimated at 5.3%, up from 
5% in November and 4.8% in October. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing a pattern that began early in the year, almost all December job 
growth was within the service sector, where 206,000 new jobs were created. The 
health subsector alone generated about 525,000 new jobs in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The December employment figures indicated that the economy has been growing 
very slowly, if at all, with only a fitful recovery from the battering it took 
from Hurricane Hugo in September, the San Francisco Bay Area Quake in October 
and a spate of nasty labor disputes in November. 
</P>
<P>
The monthly report, said Bureau of Labor Statistics Director Janet L. Norwood, 
was "consistent with a general slowing in the rate of job growth throughout 
1989." 
</P>
<P>
In some respects, the job picture in December was even worse than the figures 
suggested. If the 55,000 returning NYNEX strikers are subtracted from the 
payroll tally, job creation falls from 142,000 to less than 100,000, by far the 
weakest showing of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of duration, the factory jobs lost are much fewer than in 1984 to 
1987, when the high dollar squashed the manufacturing sector," observed Irwin 
L. Kellner, an economist with Manufacturers Hanover in New York. "But it's 
still a disturbing trend. We are entering 1990 on a down note." 
</P>
<P>
Kellner predicted that the gross national product, the basic measure of the 
nation's economy, will post slight contractions in both the fourth quarter of 
1989 and the first quarter of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
On the services side, Kellner warned that the expansion in medical services and 
some of the lower-paying service industries may signal that some people are 
taking on two jobs, perhaps part time, to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
"If the hurricane, the earthquake and the strikes were the only reasons for 
weakness late last year, we should have seen more rebound in December," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Straszheim, an economist with the Merrill Lynch investment firm in New 
York, said December's job growth should be adjusted downward to offset the 
returning NYNEX workers as well as an increase in government employment 
mandated by the Labor Department's seasonal adjustment formulas. The result, he 
calculated, would be real job growth of only 75,000 -- a clear sign of a very 
sluggish economy. 
</P>
<P>
But Giulio Martini of the Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. investment firm in New 
York interpreted the data differently. If occasional fluctuations in public 
employment over the last six months are combined with adjustments for strikes 
during the same period, he said, net new employment in the private sector has 
averaged about 130,000 a month since the middle of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
By that measure, Martini said, the December report "is not exactly an 
indication that something has gone drastically wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the weather-related collapse in construction jobs, Martini said, the 
slowdown in manufacturing generally can be attributed to problems in the auto 
industry, which has been plagued by overcapacity and foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had unemployment hovering at or near 5.3% for six months now, and 
unemployment does rise if the economy slows drastically," Martini observed. 
"Instead, this suggests that the economy is growing at something close to its 
long-term trend." 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department's estimate of 5.3% unemployment for all workers in 
December was unchanged from November. Also unchanged was a separate measure of 
civilian unemployment that excludes members of the armed forces residing in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the department estimated that November unemployment among civilians 
was 5.4% -- the highest since the first month of the year -- but in Friday's 
report that estimate was revised downward to 5.3%. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said factory orders soared in 
November to near-record levels. Orders for both durable and non-durable 
manufactured goods jumped 2.4% for the month to a seasonally adjusted $239.7 
billion, after edging down 0.1% in October. 
</P>
<P>
It was the highest level of orders since a record $239.9 billion in April and 
the fastest rate of increase since a 2.8% advance in August. Factory orders are 
usually a good indicator of future production activity.

Alan Bond's flagship Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. successfully fought Friday an 
attempt to liquidate his brewing and media empire, but it now faces new demands 
from U.S. creditors to repay $510 million immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, across the Pacific, an investment group emerged Friday with a 
possible offer to inject funds in cash-starved Bond Corp. in exchange for a 
controlling stake. 
</P>
<P>
Weatherby Investments Inc., based in Beverly Hills, and its Singapore-based 
parent, California Pacific International, said in a statement Friday that they 
had entered into talks with Bond Corp. to buy an undisclosed majority stake for 
up to $196 million ($250 million Australian). 
</P>
<P>
Weatherby and California Pacific Chairman Jeff Reynolds said his companies 
hoped to restructure most of Bond Corp.'s debt with equity as well as debt 
placements and by selling certain non-core assets. He said further details of 
his plans would be available next week. 
</P>
<P>
The possible offer could not be immediately confirmed with Bond Corp. 
officials, but some Wall Street professionals were skeptical about the possible 
offer.

REVISED REPORT FINDS S&amp;L ASSETS FELL $3.6 BILLION

The Office of Thrift Supervision on Friday revised its count of assets at 
solvent U.S. savings and loan institutions to show a $3.6-billion drop during 
October instead of the $800-million increase that it reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said the initial assets estimate, the value of a thrift's loan 
portfolio, was based on actual data submitted by 96% of the 2,636 thrifts and 
estimates for the remaining 4%. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, the remaining 4% included institutions with significant asset 
shrinkage," the agency said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The OTS said it routinely revises data to reflect the effects of new 
information. However, it said, "Rarely is the impact of these revisions as 
significant as the asset figures for October." 
</P>
<P>
The newest figures show a continuation of the drop in S&amp;L assets of the 
past several months. 
</P>
<P>
The decline is partly the result of the $159-billion savings and loan rescue 
bill, passed in 1989, that requires thrifts to increase their capital, relative 
to assets, to protect themselves against unexpected losses.

BILLS' DISCORD IS MUSIC TO THE EARS OF BROWNS 
</P>

<P>
All anybody here seems to want to talk about is an anticipated showdown for the 
AFC championship next week between the Cleveland Browns and the Denver Broncos, 
who twice in the last three years kept the Browns out of the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Up first for the Browns, however, are the embattled Buffalo Bills, their 
opponents today in an AFC playoff game at Municipal Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The underdog Bills (9-7) staggered into the postseason, losing three 
consecutive games before closing the season with a 37-0 rout of the New York 
Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jim Kelly, whose abrasiveness was tolerated when the Bills were at 
their best, has been criticized by the fans, the media and his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
And in an even more surprising development, Kelly has raised questions about 
his confidence, once thought to be unshakable. 
</P>
<P>
In-fighting among the Bills started in the second week of the season, when 
Kelly exchanged words with a receiver who was later released, and heated up 
three weeks later, when Kelly suffered a separated left shoulder in a 37-14 
loss to the Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference the next day, Kelly blamed the injury on a missed block by 
tackle Howard Ballard. Angering his teammates further, Kelly also said that 
Ballard was the weak link in the Bills' offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, while watching a videotape of a 34-3 victory over the Jets, 
assistant coaches Nick Nicolau and Tom Bresnahan got into a fistfight. Nicolau 
reportedly punched Bresnahan, opening a cut on his chin, and also drove 
Bresnahan's head through a plasterboard wall, opening a cut on his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly returned after being sidelined for three games, leading the Bills to a 
24-7 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 12 that established the Bills 
among the elite in the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
All seemed well, or well enough. 
</P>
<P>
But after Kelly played poorly the next week in a 17-16 loss at Seattle, running 
back Thurman Thomas told a cable television audience that quarterback was the 
Bills' weak link. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after Kelly saw three of his passes intercepted the next week in a 22-19 
loss to the New Orleans Saints, Kelly was asked if his confidence had been 
shaken. 
</P>
<P>
"You might say that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, he was pulled aside for a pep talk by Coach Marv Levy, who had 
always defended Kelly's brashness, calling it more than mere bravado. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly threw three more interceptions in a 21-10 loss to the San Francisco 
49ers, but none in the romp over the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Asked this week about the bickering among the Bills, Levy said: "That's behind 
us, and I'm not talking about it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Browns (9-6-1) endured hard times of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Or some did, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Bernie Kosar has weathered his most trying season, being asked to 
lead an offense that was without Kevin Mack, the Browns' leading rusher in each 
of the previous five seasons, for all but the last four games. 
</P>
<P>
When Kosar was pulled in the fourth quarter of a 21-0 loss to the Bengals in 
Week 13, the Browns had scored 37 points in four games. 
</P>
<P>
In a poll conducted the next week by a Buffalo TV station, only 51% of the 
record 28,500 respondents said they favored Kosar as the Browns' quarterback 
over his backup, journeyman Mike Pagel. 
</P>
<P>
Kosar, who has led the Browns into the playoffs in each of his five NFL 
seasons, was angered by the lack of support from the fans and also was troubled 
by Coach Bud Carson's refusal to support him publicly. Carson didn't announce 
his starter for the next week's game against the Colts until moments before the 
kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
Carson later claimed he was only trying to keep the Colts guessing and that 
Kosar's job never was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reasoning, Kosar threw for 353 yards against the Colts. But the 
Browns lost, 23-17, when Mike Prior intercepted a pass by Kosar in overtime and 
returned it 58 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Winless in four games, the Browns then closed the season with victories over 
the Minnesota Vikings, 23-17 in overtime, and the Houston Oilers, 24-20. 
</P>
<P>
Mack, jailed for a drug conviction during most of the season, then suffered a 
knee injury. He gained 27 of his 62 yards in the game-winning drive against the 
Oilers, scoring on a four-yard run with 39 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the Browns were AFC Central champions. 
</P>
<P>
Only a more troubled team stands between them and another AFC title game.

ROY CAMPANELLA HOSPITALIZED IN SERIOUS CONDITION

<P>
Roy Campanella, the Dodgers' former Hall of Fame catcher and a member of the 
club's community services department since 1978, is in serious condition at 
Northridge Hospital with pneumonia and diabetes complications, a hospital 
spokeswoman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Campanella, 68, was admitted to the hospital Dec. 30 and has been on a 
respiratory machine to assist his breathing. 
</P>
<P>
A Dodger spokesman who spoke with Campanella's wife, Roxie, Friday said she 
reported that Campanella was doing well and had shown improvement in the last 
24 hours.

HOT STEELERS STILL LIVING IN A DREAM; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: AFTER NIGHTMARISH START TO ITS SEASON, PITTSBURGH FINDS ITSELF 
PLAYING THE CONFIDENT BRONCOS IN A PLAYOFF GAME.

<P>
Talk about your great matchups. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, you have the Pittsburgh Steelers. They were happy to make the 
playoffs for the first time in four years, doing so by winning their last game 
while the Indianapolis Colts, the Cincinnati Bengals and the Raiders lost in 
the last week of the season. 
</P>
<P>
They were ecstatic to win last week's wild-card game in Jerry Glanville's 
ex-House of Pain in Houston. Now they're emotionally spent -- and underdogs. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there are the Denver Broncos. If they're as good as they 
think they are -- and as good as they were up to Week 12 when they were 10-2 -- 
they should easily finish off the Steelers and the Cleveland Browns in friendly 
Mile High Stadium to reach their third Super Bowl in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd feel a lot more confident going into the Super Bowl with this team than I 
did with the last two," owner Pat Bowlen said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that four weeks ago, before the Broncos locked up the home-field 
advantage, certainly before they had beat anyone in a playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
Does Broncomania go before a fall? 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, another nondescript Steeler team with a 9-7 regular-season record -- 
and Mark Malone, Walter Abercrombie, Frank Pollard and Elton Veals in the 
backfield -- came here for a playoff game against the solidly favored Broncos 
and upset them, 24-17. 
</P>
<P>
That's the last playoff game the Broncos lost, short of the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"That's ancient history for most of these guys," Steeler Coach Chuck Noll said 
last week. "We've got a young football team, and there aren't too many left 
from that time." 
</P>
<P>
Ridiculed as over the hill when he capped four non-playoff years with a 5-11 
record in 1988, Noll was ordered by owner Dan Rooney during the off-season to 
fire four assistant coaches and demote defensive coordinator Tony Dungy. Noll 
reportedly considered quitting, but he swallowed hard and wielded the ax. 
</P>
<P>
He was further obliged to accept a Rooney appointee, Tom Donahoe, as a sort of 
overseer on his staff. Donahoe was to watch practices, sit with the coaches in 
the press box and make suggestions, while remaining in touch with Rooney. 
</P>
<P>
When 1989 started with consecutive humiliations -- 51-0 to the Browns at home 
and 41-10 at Cincinnati -- Noll was asked to a meeting with Rooney, Art Rooney 
II and communications director Joe Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
They gave Noll a pep talk. 
</P>
<P>
Noll was asked later by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Ed Bouchette if he'd 
wondered why they were doing it. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Noll said. 
</P>
<P>
Had he asked them? 
</P>
<P>
"No," Noll said, "but I was thinking it." 
</P>
<P>
There was rampant speculation that Noll would be fired if they didn't pull out 
of the tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
"We had Minnesota the third week," said quarterback Bubby Brister, who vowed 
before the season that the Steelers would win 10 games and make the playoffs. 
"I really started thinking, 'This may get worse before it gets better.' 
</P>
<P>
"Chuck Noll was the same coach. He didn't blast anybody. He didn't embarrass 
anybody. He didn't say we weren't any good and we couldn't win any more games, 
like some coaches in this league have done. He was pretty level-headed. He just 
said, 'We need to get here earlier, we need to stay here later, we need to work 
a little harder. The guys we've got in this room right here can be a 
championship-caliber football team.' " 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh beat Minnesota, 27-14. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers won five of their last six, then the wild-card game against the 
Oilers, making them -- not the San Francisco 49ers, Broncos, New York Giants or 
Rams -- the hottest team in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you know, we're pretty determined right now," Brister said. "But we've 
got some guys nicked up right now. We're coming off a very emotional game. It's 
going to take us a couple of days to get back to getting ready for this one." 
</P>
<P>
It had better not take too long. It's curtain time again. 
</P>
<P>
Playoff Notes 
</P>
<P>
Contrast: The Broncos were No. 15 on offense, No. 3 on defense. The Steelers 
were 28th and 19th, respectively . . . Less contrast: Denver quarterback John 
Elway finished with 18 interceptions and was the league's 18th-ranked passer. 
Pittsburgh quarterback Bubby Brister was No. 20 . . . Brister is an engaging 
fourth-year pro from Monroe, La. Before the finale against Tampa Bay he 
guaranteed a victory, and before the Oiler game he said: "We're gonna shock the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
Brister on the game plan: "We're playing the same kind of ball Pittsburgh has 
always played -- blood and guts and stuff like that. We try to run the ball. We 
try to possess the ball as much as we can." . . . Good idea, since the 
Steelers' starting defensive linemen finished eighth, 10th and 11th on the team 
in tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Rookies: The Broncos have Bobby Humphrey, who is being compared to Marcus 
Allen. Like Allen, Humphrey is tall, fluid and athletic, but doesn't have 
sprinter's speed. He gained 1,151 yards even though he wasn't a starter until 
week five. The Steelers' Tim Worley was the seventh overall pick in the draft, 
a 6-foot-2 220-pounder who has sprinter's speed. He held out, lost three 
fumbles in the opener, and after a defeat in week seven, said: "I can't do it 
by myself. It starts up front." He had 417 yards in the last five games.

OFFICIAL NOTICE OF INQUIRY SENT TO CLEMSON BY NCAA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The NCAA has sent Clemson an official letter of inquiry after a preliminary 
investigation uncovered 14 alleged rule violations, ranging from monetary 
payments to illegal recruiting contacts, the school said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
David Berst, assistant executive director for enforcement for the NCAA, said in 
a letter Thursday to university President Max Lennon that it appears the school 
had violated NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
"Based upon a review of the available information, it appears reasonable to 
expect that the NCAA Committee on Infractions will find violations of NCAA 
legislation concerning these matters," Berst said. "Accordingly, this letter . 
. . constitutes an official inquiry." 
</P>
<P>
The alleged rule violations occurred from 1984 to 1988 and involved both 
players and recruits, according to the school, which received the NCAA letter 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The violations include the payment of $50 to $150, gifts of a cap and 
sweatshirt, improper purchase of meals and auto transportation and violation of 
recruiting rules that limit the number of visits and the period of time when 
visits can be made, the school said. 
</P>
<P>
Lennon was out of town and could not be reached for comment. Nick Lomax, vice 
president for student affairs, said the school's internal investigation and its 
work with the NCAA had prepared it for the NCAA's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"We pretty well had an idea of what they were coming up with," Lomax said. "I 
would say that we didn't have any surprises in this report." 
</P>
<P>
Clemson was placed on two years' probation beginning in 1982 for recruiting 
violations, one year after the Atlantic Coast Conference school won the 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Ten James Madison University basketball players violated an NCAA rule during a 
trip to Hawaii in 1988 when they received free airline tickets for agreeing to 
be bumped off their original flight. 
</P>
<P>
The school said Thursday that the NCAA was informed of the violation this week, 
but no further action is anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
NCAA enforcement director David Berst said the type of violation is minor.

NEWSWIRE: JUDGE RECOMMENDS PROBERT DEPORTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal immigration judge in Chicago recommended that Bob Probert, former 
Detroit Red Wing, be deported for his conviction on a drug importation charge, 
an attorney for the hockey player said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Probert is currently serving a three-month term at a federal prison in 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
After his release, Probert is scheduled to spend three months at a halfway 
house designated by federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Probert's attorney, Harold Fried, said he will spend the weekend reviewing 
Probert's options, including an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Probert was arrested March 2 at the tunnel connecting Windsor, Canada, and 
Detroit when authorities found cocaine in his underwear. 
</P>
<P>
He pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Detroit to importing cocaine for 
his own use and was sentenced Oct. 17 to three months in prison, three months 
in a halfway house and three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after his arrest, Probert was banned from the NHL. League president 
John Ziegler later said Probert would be allowed to rejoin the Red Wings if he 
fulfilled all terms of his probation.

$1.45 MILLION MAY NOT BE ENOUGH FOR DICKERSON TO HAVE FUN IN '90

The Indianapolis Colts want to sign Eric Dickerson to a contract extension. 
But, in an interview published Friday, the NFL's seventh all-time rusher said 
he might not even report for training camp next summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I plan on coming in, but there's still a chance I might not show 
up," Dickerson said in an interview with The Atlanta Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson is under contract to play next season for $1.45 million, the final 
year of the contract he signed after his trade to Indianapolis by the Rams on 
Oct. 31, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't love football the way I once loved the game," he told the newspaper in 
a telephone interview. "I don't look at it as fun anymore, and it definitely 
used to be fun. A lot of the fun has been taken away from it, I guess, because 
you go through so much on the field and off the field." 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson, who rushed for 10,000 yards quicker than any back in NFL history (91 
games), was bothered by a nagging hamstring injury for much of the past season 
and missed a game due to injury for the first time in his NFL career at Miami 
on Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
He's scheduled to play in the Pro Bowl next month. "I'm not hurt badly now. It 
makes you think that maybe it's time to get out healthy," said Dickerson, who 
rushed for 1,311 yards in 314 carries in 1989.

Bill LaForge, new director of operations for the Tri-City Americans of the 
Western Hockey League, has been reassigned by team owner Ron Dixon so he won't 
come in contact with the players, who staged a one-game boycott a week ago in 
protest of LaForge's forceful style. LaForge had been hired by the Kennewick 
(Wash.) team Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said he was putting LaForge in charge of scouting and the players agreed 
not to boycott any more games.

ROMANIA'S IVAN MAY BE HERE AFTER ALL

After Olympic 1,500-meter champion Paula Ivan accepted an invitation to run the 
mile in the Jan. 19 Sunkist Invitational at the Sports Arena, Romanian track 
and field officials said she couldn't go. But now, since the Romanian 
revolution, those officials are out, and she might be back in. 
</P>
<P>
It couldn't have come at a better time for meet promoter Al Franken, who is 
counting on Ivan as a major attraction. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Moraru, a former Romanian sportswriter who defected to the United 
States in 1984 and now lives in Glendale, spoke by telephone Wednesday with 
Ivan's coach, Maricica Puica, former Olympic 3,000-meter champion, who said 
that all she needs to bring Ivan to Los Angeles is another invitation. Franken 
was working on that Wednesday through The Athletics Congress, which governs 
track and field in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Franken has offered $100,000 to the winners of the men's and women's miles if 
they break the world indoor records. His guarantee is insured by a company in 
Dallas, which charged him premiums of $12,000 for the women's race and $7,000 
for the men's race. But if Ivan doesn't show, he expects a substantial refund 
on the women's premium. 
</P>
<P>
The government of Nicolae Ceausescu might have done too well in training some 
athletes. Pistol shooters Sorin Babii and Ion Cornelu, both Olympic medalists, 
reportedly lined up on the pro-democracy side during the revolution and helped 
defend an important military target. 
</P>
<P>
Another athlete who took up arms against Ceausescu's state police, former 
Romanian rugby captain Radu Durbac, died in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Dynamo Bucharest, the Romanian soccer team that was sponsored by the state 
police, has reorganized and changed its name to Unirea Tricolor. 
</P>
<P>
Nadia Watch: U.S. gymnast Kurt Thomas, once a close friend of Nadia Comaneci, 
said he believes she hasn't contacted her former coach, Bela Karolyi, since 
arriving in the United States because she believes he deceived her when he 
defected in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"Nadia wanted to defect with him, but Bela discouraged her by saying he wasn't 
ready, either," Thomas told the Chicago Tribune. "Then Bela didn't show up at 
the airport for the plane (to Romania), and the rest is history. I can 
understand Bela's point. He didn't want to be responsible for taking an 
18-year-old national hero with him." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere on the Bloc, Katarina Witt's coach, Jutta Mueller, threatened to go 
to the West to teach figure skaters unless the East Germans made it possible 
for her to make as much money at home. As a result, the East Germans will allow 
skaters from the West to come to her rink in Karl Marx-Stadt. It won't be long 
before all of East Germany's sports facilities are open to Western athletes in 
exchange for fees. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Witt said she had made a mistake when she defended the former East 
German government in recent interviews. Upon returning home from filming a 
movie in Spain and reading about the corruption in former leader Erich 
Honecker's government, she said on West German television, "I fell from one 
faint into another and simply couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
She also said that she will consider leaving East Germany if harassment of 
athletes by their former fans doesn't end. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts very much when someone says, 'You athletes were the privileged ones. 
I find this terribly unfair, to throw us into a pot with people who really did 
some ugly things. . . . If people (continue to be) malicious, I shall pack my 
bags and leave." 
</P>
<P>
For 36 years, East Germany staged a formal ceremony to honor its sportsmen and 
sportswomen of the year. The cost in 1988 was $23,500. In December, the 
ceremony consisted of the winners, gymnast Andreas Wacker and swimmer Kristin 
Otto, receiving their awards in a drab television studio during halftime of a 
team handball match. Both wore blue jeans. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the old regime, the new leadership in East German sports supports a 
combined East Berlin-West Berlin bid for the Summer Olympics in either 2000 or 
2004. If the Chinese prove incapable of organizing the Asian Games in Beijing 
later this year, bet on Berlin for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Athletic Federation, which governs track and field, 
will decide on Jan. 19 whether to strip Ben Johnson of his world record. The 
IAAF voted last summer that it has the right to do so because he admitted using 
anabolic steroids in training for the world record he set in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
A London newspaper reported last month that boxing promoter Bob Arum is 
organizing a $3.2-million race between Johnson and Carl Lewis on Sept. 25 in 
Barcelona. That's the day Johnson's two-year suspension ends. But Lewis' 
manager, Joe Douglas of the Santa Monica Track Club, denies that Arum is 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
"I am having discussions with a U.S. boxing promoter, but it is not Arum," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
High hurdler Roger Kingdom is Track &amp; Field News' male athlete of the year 
for 1989. The only other American in the top 10 was triple jumper Mike Conley. 
</P>
<P>
Nominations for the idle threat of the year begin and end here: The 
international soccer federation (FIFA) said that Argentina's Diego Maradona 
might be banned from this year's World Cup in Italy because he alleged that the 
draw to determine the first-round pairings was fixed. 
</P>
<P>
Defending him is Milan's respected newspaper, Corriere della Sera, which wrote 
that he only said "what many had thought and some had let be understood between 
the lines. It has long been known that the World Cup draws are skillfully 
predetermined, but nobody ever protested. Now that Maradona, Mr. Disagreeable, 
said it openly, it's too easy to attack him." 
</P>
<P>
Maradona said he will apologize, but not recant. He was suspicious because host 
Italy was drawn into the easiest group, which includes the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The United States begins training for the World Cup with a camp scheduled for 
Jan. 5-18 in LaJolla. Twenty-eight players were invited. 
</P>
<P>
Not among them is Ricky Davis, the United States' leading goal scorer in 
international competition. He has not played with the national team since the 
Seoul Olympics because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA midfielder Chris Henderson didn't play with the team last year in World 
Cup qualifying but has been invited to camp. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty prospects for the 1992 U.S. Olympic soccer team, which actually is an 
under-23 team, will gather from Jan. 5-13 in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. freestyle wrestlers are on the verge of catching the Soviets, who have 
dominated the sport. In seven matches against the Soviets last month in 
Pittsburgh, the Americans won five. That included a victory for John Smith, 24, 
Olympic and two-time world champion at 136.5 pounds, over Sergei Beloglazov, 
33, a two-time Olympic and six-time world champion at 125.5 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being younger, Smith had an advantage because they wrestled at his 
weight. A crowd of 9,690 watched. 
</P>
<P>
In Greco-Roman wrestling, two Americans won World Cup titles in November. One 
was Gogi Parseghian of San Clemente, who emigrated to the United States from 
Armenia in the Soviet Union. He could have his U.S. citizenship in time for the 
1992 Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
In an international survey conducted by Italy's largest sports daily newspaper, 
Gazetta dello Sports, Carl Lewis was voted the male athlete of the '80s. 
Runners-up, in order, were Maradona, Wayne Gretzky and Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
In voting for the female athlete of the '80s, Martina Navratilova was first, 
Steffi Graf second and East German track star Marita Koch third.

RICK DU BROW: DID RATHER-BUSH TIFF HELP SINK CBS ANCHOR?; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: TWO YEARS AFTER THEIR HEATED PRIME-TIME EXCHANGE, THE NEWSMAN'S 
RATINGS HAVE FALLEN WHILE THE PRESIDENT'S POPULARITY HAS RISEN.

<P>
Possibly there's no connection between Dan Rather's ratings tailspin and 
President Bush's popularity in the polls as 1990 begins. But very possibly, 
there is a connection, after all. 
</P>
<P>
It was two years ago this month that the famous, combative Bush-Rather TV 
interview turned the former vice president's image from that of a wimp into a 
he-man in nine minutes on the "CBS Evening News." 
</P>
<P>
Bush got the best of the coverage that followed the incident, in which the 
anchor was widely chided for an argumentative, accusatory approach. Rather was 
certainly digging for legitimate information -- the extent of Bush's 
involvement in the Iran-Contra affair as he sought the presidency. But he was 
outfoxed by the well-prepared Bush camp, which believed CBS was out to get 
their man and succeeded in making Rather the heavy. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's shrewd television adviser, Roger Ailes, was to say later that he had the 
feeling that "CBS decided to take George Bush out of the race, period" with the 
Rather interview. 
</P>
<P>
Despite criticism, Rather remained atop the nightly news heap in 1988 -- CBS' 
savior as its prime-time lineup self-destructed. But now, by the oddest 
coincidence, the long-dominant anchor has lost his spot as No. 1 at the end of 
Bush's first year in the White House, replaced by Peter Jennings and ABC's 
"World News Tonight" as the 1989 winner. 
</P>
<P>
True, ABC News has been coming on strong with Jennings, Ted Koppel, et al. 
True, various surveys have indicated that ABC's nightly news is the least 
critical of the White House, probably a ratings advantage in covering a popular 
President -- and that CBS is toughest, a proud tradition at the house that 
Edward R. Murrow built. True, also, that the plummeting ratings of CBS' prime 
time may also finally be dragging Rather down with them. 
</P>
<P>
But maybe, just maybe, that Bush-Rather interview was a more than subtle factor 
that stayed in the back of a lot of minds -- and helped propel along the 
defection from CBS News of viewers with long and critical memories. Because the 
interview was strong and polarizing and, at times, even nasty with some dirty 
infighting. Let's go back for a minute and remember the way it was. 
</P>
<P>
"You've impugned my integrity," Bush told Rather, "by suggesting with one of 
your little boards (visuals) that I didn't tell the truth. . . . I'm asking for 
fair play, and I thought I was here to talk about my views on education, or on 
getting this deficit down." 
</P>
<P>
Said Rather: "One-third of the Republicans and one-fourth of the people who say 
they rather like you believe you're hiding something." 
</P>
<P>
With Bush protesting that CBS told him the interview was going to be a 
political profile, he nonetheless had one well-prepared thrust that undeniably 
scored powerfully against Rather. The anchor, just four months previously, had 
embarrassed himself and his network by letting the "CBS Evening News" go black 
for six minutes by angrily leaving the set when he was told a tennis match 
would run over into his broadcast. And this is how Bush one-upped Rather in 
their interview: 
</P>
<P>
Rather: "I don't want to be argumentative, Mr. Vice President. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Bush: "You do, Dan. This is not a great night, because I want to talk about why 
I want to be President. Why those 41% of the people (referring to poll figures) 
are supporting me." 
</P>
<P>
Rather (interrupting): "Mr. Vice President. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Bush (continuing): "And I don't think it's fair to judge a whole career, it's 
not fair to judge my whole career by a rehash on Iran. How would you like it if 
I judged your career by those seven minutes when you walked off the set in New 
York? Would you like that? I have respect for you, but I don't have respect for 
what you're doing here tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Rather told Bush, "The question is, you've made us hypocrites in the face of 
the world." And then the CBS anchor continued: "There are clearly some 
unanswered questions remaining. Are you willing to go to a news conference 
before the Iowa caucuses, answer questions from all comers. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been to 86 news conferences since March," said Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"I gather," said Rather, "that the answer is no. Thank you very much for being 
with us, Mr. Vice President." 
</P>
<P>
And, with that, he cut away bluntly and ended the interview. Remember? 
</P>
<P>
It was clearly one of the most extraordinary broadcasts in TV history. And it 
could be argued that Rather, in his zeal, ironically gave Bush just the hand he 
needed on his road to the presidency -- a dramatic turnaround moment in front 
of a national audience. 
</P>
<P>
But if, indeed, Jennings is the network anchor of the 1990s -- as he's being 
described -- it could well be because his easygoing style has been a 
comfortable fit with the nation during a time of such laid-back Presidents as 
Ronald Reagan and Bush. Jennings is a good journalist and a good anchor, but 
there is something necessary -- if not endearing -- about the testy, grating, 
bulldozing manner of Rather, who may go off the deep end at times but at least 
is going for something. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the worst thing TV news can do is ease up on its intense coverage of a 
popular President like Reagan -- which it did -- or Bush, who is flying high 
with huge public support of the U.S. military move on Panama and the capture of 
dictator Manuel Noriega. As David Brinkley noted months ago, it was Mikhail 
Gorbachev who really opened the door to the new political mood and events of 
Europe, but Bush is inheriting good will simply by being President as it's 
happening. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are, Rather will continue to be the hardest-hitting network anchor, 
warts and all. He can drive you crazy with those corn-pone sayings that often 
don't seem to say anything. He smiles too forcefully, as if he's uncertain 
audiences love him. And he certainly seems to fit what Richard Nixon, another 
Rather nemesis, wrote incisively in TV Guide about television reporters -- that 
"in many ways they are political actors just like the President, mindful of 
their ratings, careful of preserving and building their power." 
</P>
<P>
Rather "went too far," Sam Donaldson said after the Bush interview. It's hard 
to argue with that, and maybe the CBS anchor is finally now paying the price. 
But perhaps, when you think about it, TV doesn't have enough slashing, 
down-and-dirty interviews on its legitimate newscasts. I wouldn't mind seeing 
Rather and Bush do their thing once a month. It's better to have a reporter who 
sometimes goes too far than not far enough.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'AFTER THE WAR': PERSONAL BATTLES IN PEACETIME BRITAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It runs 10 hours but ends too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"After the War" -- the new arrival on Sunday's "Masterpiece Theatre" -- is that 
captivating, a simply stunning effort from Britain's Granada Television and the 
strongest candidate yet for miniseries of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Americans may have had it with long miniseries, but happily not the British, 
who remain state-of-the-art when it comes to these extended dramas, many of 
which have constituted some of the best television of the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Here is one that can make your evening. Sexy, brilliant and unsettling, its 
eight segments (including two that run two hours) air at 9 p.m. Sundays on 
Channels 28 and 15 and at 8 p.m. on Channels 50 and 24. Treat time. 
</P>
<P>
This is Frederic Raphael's urbane and richly charactered reflection of life 
among the British middle class after World War II -- an era that echoed horrors 
and yet surged with optimism, Raphael says, "a belief that great changes were 
possible, that freedom and fraternity would replace hostility and tyranny." 
</P>
<P>
In "After the War," reality intervenes. 
</P>
<P>
Although British, Raphael's humanly flawed characters are universal. They 
crease and bruise. They also succeed and falter, inspire and disappoint, 
surface and vanish, then reappear. They're intriguing, especially because 
they're open wounds, haunted and defined by their pasts, yet ever evolving as 
they chart their way through the postwar years, confronted by moral and ethical 
choices. No exclamation points. When we leave these people, with the 
Arab-Israeli war of 1967 as a backdrop, they are works in progress, still 
fighting personal wars and trying to discover themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The premiere actually begins during World War II, in 1942, as young Michael 
Jordan and Joe Hirsch meet at a prep school in Devon, where they play boys' 
games while learning lessons on human behavior they'll carry into adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
Both are Jewish, but are unalike and have little in common. Michael, the 
story's main protagonist, is the son of a prosperous barrister. He will grow up 
feeling somehow guilty for having been comfortably removed from the atrocities 
witnessed by Joe, a hardened, driven refugee from Nazism and the son of a 
carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
The lives of Michael and Joe will interlock for the next 25 years, but it's 
their fathers who meet briefly in the second episode, in 1947, when Manfred 
Hirsch gives Samuel Jordan help in investigating a German banker's possible 
links to Nazism. 
</P>
<P>
What a fascinatingly complex and challenging episode this is, beautifully 
directed by John Madden and wonderfully acted by Anton Rodgers as Samuel 
Jordan. Plus Jeroen Krabbe just puts you away in a cameo as the German banker 
whose intellectual pragmatism makes disturbing sense. 
</P>
<P>
The directing for the 10 hours, split among Madden, John Glenister and Nicholas 
Renton, is outstanding throughout, and with Adrian Lukis leading the way as the 
adult Michael, "After the War" also delivers one memorable performance after 
another: 
</P>
<P>
Robert Reynolds as Joe; Clare Higgins as Michael's sister, Rachel; Serena 
Gordon as Michael's wife, Annie Rose; Claire Goodall as an actress who exploits 
Michael, Denis Quilley and Susannah York as a theater couple and Art Malik as 
an Algerian doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as Michael moves from tabloid newspaper writing to playwriting, Joe 
becomes a ruthless TV mogul and Rachel settles in volatile West Africa with her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
Coming late in the series, Rachel's violent African saga is played out against 
a seething black nationalism and anti-imperialism that recalls the British 
empire-bashing of Granada's earlier "The Jewel in the Crown," arguably the best 
miniseries ever. As in "The Jewel in the Crown," Raphael's series mingles past 
and present while refracting global politics through its characters' personal 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
War business and show business coexist at a distance. Nothing in "After the 
War" is darker -- or funnier -- than its forays into a cynical, yet deliciously 
wicked theater world. Raphael finds grime beneath the glitter. There's cruelty 
and aching melancholy here, but also slashing wit. Meanwhile, as Michael gains 
success as a writer, he begins to measure his "flip lines" against the reality 
of the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
"After the War" deserves to eclipse "The Glittering Prizes" as Raphael's 
best-known TV work. If there's a glimmer of weakness here, it's the dialogue, 
which ironically is also one of Raphael's great strengths. At times, his lines 
are so memorable and incredibly clever that you can't imagine actual people 
speaking them. However, that's a minor failing in overwhelmingly grand 
television. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the story, Michael's aloof father teaches him the tango, and they 
dance together in the dark. It's a lovely, lingering scene, one of many. In 
this series, nearly everything dances.

SCHEPISI'S 'HOUSE' SHELTERS A KINDER, GENTLER RUSSIA;

MOVIES: THE DIRECTOR SAYS 'RUSSIA HOUSE,' WHICH RECENTLY WRAPPED IN MOSCOW, 
WILL FORCE PEOPLE TO 'RETHINK THEIR ATTITUDES ABOUT THIS PLACE.'

Western cinematic images of the Soviet Union, mostly the product of decades of 
spy movies and other films about the Cold War, are about to be challenged by a 
new film that its director says will show "a different Russia," one that is 
gentler and more human, a country that today is deeply troubled but undergoing 
profound changes. 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to see a different Russia, a Russia that has never been shown 
before in the West, and they are going to have to rethink their attitudes about 
this place," Australian director Fred Schepisi said recently here as he 
finished filming segments of "The Russia House," which is based on John le 
Carre's latest spy novel. 
</P>
<P>
"How willing they will be to discard the old images and stereotypes is hard to 
say, but they will definitely be challenged." 
</P>
<P>
Schepisi's film, a $21-million Pathe International production with Sean Connery 
and Michelle Pfeiffer in the principal roles, seems likely to amplify the 
"soft-on-communism" controversy around Le Carre's novel. 
</P>
<P>
The novel has been castigated by many conservative critics in the United States 
who have accused Le Carre, whom they took to be one of them, of forgetting who 
the bad guys are in East-West relations and for portraying Western intelligence 
agencies as clinging to the Cold War at a time when the Soviet Union appears to 
be abandoning the very policies that seemed to make it such a threat. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who should know what is going on here, the import of these changes 
for the Soviet Union and the impact they will have on the world, seem to be the 
very ones who falling behind in their understanding, who can't keep up with 
events here," Schepisi said. 
</P>
<P>
"They, to my mind, are more concerned about 'staying in business,' as it were, 
instead of promoting peace. That's what the book is about, and why it has been 
unexpectedly controversial, and that's what this film will be about. . . . In 
showing people a different Russia, this film will give them new insights into a 
lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
Schepisi's "different Russia," on one level, is intensely physical -- Moscow, 
Leningrad and their environs, which serve as the backdrop for "The Russia 
House." The film, scheduled for release next fall, is one of the first major 
Western productions to be shot here under the liberalized conditions that are 
part of glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Russia, the real Russia, and not Finland masquerading as Russia that 
people will see," he said. "We have tried to film as many actual locations as 
possible with the normal traffic, the normal crowds, life the way it is lived 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"People will be surprised, I think, at the vast scale, the breadth of the 
streets, the huge apartment blocks, the incredible beauty of so much of Russia 
-- none of which they have seen before. We get beyond Red Square, beyond St. 
Basil's and its onion domes." 
</P>
<P>
But Schepisi, who spent 10 weeks here planning and then filming, also hopes to 
portray the sweeping changes under way here, to set the film against the 
present political and social background. 
</P>
<P>
"The Moscow that people will see is a city of lost churches, of lost time, of 
lost grace," he said, "but it is also a city that is struggling to come back, 
that is under reconstruction, that is going through a spiritual rebirth. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"To portray perestroika, though, we also have to capture the run-down apartment 
buildings, the stores without food, the deep alienation people here feel and 
the changes that they want. But the trick is not to get too involved, to 
approach and pull back and then approach again. 
</P>
<P>
"The humanity of Russians will come through -- how touchingly generous they are 
when they get to know you -- and many people will have to rethink their ideas 
about this place. In the film, Barley Blair (Connery, the hero, a London book 
publisher recruited by British intelligence) learns he really likes Russia 
because of that humanity. And for us that, too, will be a new image of Russia." 
</P>
<P>
And, although the film, like the book, falls in the espionage genre, Schepisi 
said he prefers to think of it as an "anti-spy" movie. 
</P>
<P>
As in Le Carre's novel, the Soviets are not the bad guys, the hero could be 
accused of treason for abandoning his mission and American and British 
intelligence officials emerge as heartless manipulators of people's lives in 
the name of national security. 
</P>
<P>
"What people think and do often, quite fortunately, has little to do with what 
government bodies think and do," Schepisi said. "And that is an insight, which 
seems especially true here, that we want in the film." 
</P>
<P>
While this "different Russia" is in Le Carre's novel, the result of the British 
author's two trips to the Soviet Union, Schepisi's ability to portray it stems 
from the cooperation he has received from Moscow Film Studio and a Soviet-West 
German joint venture, Corona, in his five weeks of filming here. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people advised against filming here and told us to stick to Finland," 
Schepisi said. "It would never work, they told us, and we would be weeks behind 
schedule and millions over budget. But we finished shooting only half a day 
behind schedule despite a lot of bad weather, probably a little bit under 
budget and very appreciative of the cooperation we got. 
</P>
<P>
"True, something that is so different from what we know -- and their system is 
very different -- does make for difficulties. But once we got to know the 
system, surmounted the language barriers, got the crew settled down and began 
to work, things went very well. Our Soviet partners and crew showed great 
flexibility, and we had extraordinary cooperation on things that we would never 
be able to do in the United States. Again, that's contrary to all the images we 
have of this place." 
</P>
<P>
The film has a powerful patron, however, in Elem Klimov, first secretary of the 
Soviet Union of Cinematographers and an influential member of the political 
avant-garde here. 
</P>
<P>
"Elem Klimov sold this to the Soviet leadership as a real experiment in 
glasnost," Schepisi said. "Remember this, on the surface, is an espionage film, 
based on a Le Carre novel, starring Sean Connery once again as a British 
intelligence agent. But they read the script here and were willing to put aside 
their stereotypes of us and help." 
</P>
<P>
In return for Klimov's cooperation, Schepisi will help the Soviet director film 
Mikhail Bulgakov's novel "The Master and Margarita" in the United States next 
year. "It's not only the right thing to do after the help we have had here, but 
it will be a privilege to work with Klimov," Schepisi said. 
</P>
<P>
Schepisi's time here and his contacts with Soviets made him, like Le Carre, a 
full supporter of perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
"We in the West ought to think about what perestroika means not just for the 
Soviet Union but for us," Schepisi said. "We ought to think what Gorbachev's 
changes will mean for this country and what his success will mean for the 
world. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"They are encountering difficulties right now. Perestroika is bringing harder 
times, less food, uncertainty about the future. They need our support at this 
moment, our encouragement so that an opportunity, a historic opportunity, does 
not slip away."

WEISMAN PROMISES $3 MILLION TO U. OF MINNESOTA ART MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUNA SNOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles art collector Frederick R. Weisman has pledged $3 million to the 
University of Minnesota in the hopes that his alma mater's art museum will 
finally get a home of its own to be designed by Santa Monica-based architect 
Frank Gehry. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the University of Minnesota and I was born in Minneapolis, so 
there's a lot of strong ties there," Weisman said. "Minnesota means a great 
deal to me, and the city of Minneapolis is important to me." 
</P>
<P>
Although he said that he was "very excited" about plans for the new museum, 
Weisman stressed that the donation through his Frederick R. Weisman Foundation 
of Los Angeles must still be approved by the university's board of regents, 
which he is scheduled to meet on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the board of regents, the $8-million structure will occupy a 
conspicuous site at the east end of the Washington Avenue Bridge. Gehry's firm 
was selected in November after a two-year search. Gehry was in New York on 
business and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"My feet haven't touched the ground since I heard about (Weisman's gift)," said 
Lyndel King, director of the university art museum. "This means that we will be 
able to build a new museum here at the University of Minnesota, and that has 
been a dream of mine for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Weisman's $3-million gift would qualify for a matching grant from the 
University of Minnesota Foundation. The foundation has already matched $1 
million previously raised. With the Weisman grant and match, the museum would 
have the $8 million estimated cost for the building. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to presume that this is something that's really going to happen 
until they approve it," said Weisman, whose foundation holds workshops on art 
and architecture-related topics, presents traveling exhibitions and loans works 
to American embassies overseas. "But they're talking about starting work on the 
building later this year, and they're talking about it taking about three years 
to finish the museum completely." 
</P>
<P>
Weisman hinted that his relationship with the University of Minnesota and 
museum officials, might continue. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to assist them with building this museum, then we're going to 
be awfully sure that they have art to show in there," said Weisman, whose 
foundation has sizable holdings in post-World War II art. The name of the 
building would be determined by the Weisman Foundation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1934, the museum has spent its entire existence in the university's 
Northrop Auditorium, where it is hampered by inadequate office and exhibition 
space, insufficient security and lack of climate control for displayed artwork. 
Its collection, which over the years has grown to some 12,000 objects, is 
stored in four scattered locations, according to reports.

Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, embroiled in a two-year dispute 
between faculty and a fundamentalist-dominated administration, has been placed 
"on warning" by an accrediting agency. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Assn. of Colleges and Schools says the Wake Forest, N.C., seminary 
must correct various deficiencies within two years or face further measures. 
</P>
<P>
Faculty members charge the seminary trustees in 1987 changed the way the school 
picks professors to ensure that only "biblical inerrantists" are hired in the 
wake of fundamentalists gaining control of the denomination.

The United Church of Christ, based in New York City since the denomination was 
formed by merger in 1957, opened its new headquarters here this week. 
</P>
<P>
Three top officers and skeleton crews of several national agencies have shifted 
work here. 
</P>
<P>
Three floors of the headquarters building at 700 Prospect Ave. are being 
renovated to provide working space for about 90 employees. 
</P>
<P>
Further renovations start in March. Altogether, national offices of the 1.6 
million-member denomination have about 350 employees, most of them based in New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
The two largest agencies are remaining there through 1990, the Board for 
Homeland Ministries and Board for World Ministries, but will began shifting 
some personnel to Cleveland in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The move from New York City to Cleveland was approved in July by the church's 
legislative general synod.

3 ARRESTED IN SHOOTING OF 4-YEAR-OLD GIRL 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local law enforcement investigators, with the aid of the Orange County district 
attorney's gang detail, have arrested an Oceanside man in connection with a 
Christmas Eve drive-by shooting that left a 4-year-old girl hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd Avery, 18, described by acquaintances as an unemployed high school 
dropout, was arrested at his mother's home at 2 p.m. Thursday, police officials 
said. He has no prior criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
Avery's arrest was made public on Friday after police arrested a San Juan 
Capistrano juvenile and named another who was already being held in Orange 
County Juvenile Hall on an unrelated charge, San Clemente Police Chief Albert 
C. Ehlow said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, police said they have recovered a shotgun believed to have been 
used in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Avery, who moved to Oceanside from San Clemente almost two years ago, was 
charged with attempted murder and shooting at an occupied dwelling, Ehlow said. 
He was being held in Orange County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
The two juveniles, whose names were withheld, face similar charges, according 
to Ehlow. 
</P>
<P>
"We put a lot of work into this," Ehlow said, adding that the investigation is 
continuing. "We're still trying to sort things out." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the involvement of the district attorney's gang unit, police and 
investigators for the Orange County Sheriff's Department maintained on Friday 
that they are not sure if the shooting was gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting a lot of conflicting stories," Ehlow said. "Until we get it 
straightened out, we won't know if it's gang-related. It could be a personal 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
The shooting victim, Prisca Lorena Caudillo, was hit in the face and upper body 
by shotgun pellets as she was playing on the porch of a neighbor's second-floor 
apartment in the 100 block of Avenida Pelayo. 
</P>
<P>
She was released on Dec. 28 from Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in 
Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The family was unavailable for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Police initially had speculated that the shooting was the result of a feud 
between two gangs -- the San Clemente Varrio Chico and the San Juan Boys, also 
called the SJC Boys. 
</P>
<P>
But law enforcement officials later said that they had no proof that the 
shooting -- the first of its type in South County -- was linked to gang 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
Ehlow confirmed that the two juvenile suspects, both 17 and Latino, were San 
Juan Capistrano residents. But he declined to say if the two were members of 
the SJC Boys. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Dist. Atty. Martin Engquist said that the gang unit was asked to aid 
in the investigation at the request of the San Clemente Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We got involved because there was an indication that there was group 
involvement," Engquist said. But like other law enforcement officials, he was 
reluctant to say that the shooting was the result of gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called 'Sleepy' 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Avery's former classmates in Oceanside, who said Avery wore thick 
glasses and was nicknamed "Sleepy," expressed mixed feelings about the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
While some said that they believed Avery was capable of committing such a 
crime, others defended him, saying he was "mellow and friendly" and spent a lot 
of time with his girlfriend and 1-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"He was probably just in the wrong place at the wrong time," said David Rivera, 
21, as he stood with a group of friends in a park near Avery's home. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he would have pulled a trigger," Rivera added. 
</P>
<P>
Acquaintances described Avery as a quiet person and one who did not pick 
fights. Although not a gang member himself, he often hung around with known 
gang members in the neighborhood around the high school and often visited 
friends in South County. 
</P>
<P>
"He's like a home boy," said one 16-year-old girl who asked not to be 
identified. "He was not part of a gang. He just hung around with some gang 
members." 
</P>
<P>
Avery's mother, visibly shaken by her son's arrest, declined to be interviewed 
or give her first name. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to talk about it," she said, holding back tears before going back 
into her modest, single-story home located in an older section of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Police would not give details of the connection between Avery and the San Juan 
Capistrano juveniles who were arrested on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe they know each other," Ehlow said. "We're not certain what the 
relationship is." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Richard Downing said that investigators believe that the two juveniles 
were with Avery in his car when the shots were fired on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Suspects believed to be riding in two other cars are still at large, Downing 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the other cars, a 1978 Buick, was found abandoned along Interstate 5 in 
Capistrano Beach shortly after the shooting, police said. It was later found to 
be stolen in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of the shooting, Avery reported that his light-blue, 1973 Datsun 
had been stolen "somewhere on Camino de los Mares" in San Clemente, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Avery's car was found, stripped down, off San Juan Creek Road 
in south San Juan Capistrano, Lt. Bob Rivas said. He would not, however, say 
what evidence was in the car that may have linked it to the shooting and 
Avery's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Ehlow said police were tipped off to the location of the weapon believed to 
have been used in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
A 20-gauge, pump-action shotgun was found buried in the back yard of a San Juan 
Capistrano residence. Police declined to give the address, saying that other 
suspects were still being sought in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Ehlow said it was not likely that residents at the home where the shotgun was 
found were involved with the shooting.

JUDGE ORDERS RETURN OF BABY TO COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
CUSTODY FIGHT: A CANADIAN JURIST SAYS CALIFORNIA COURTS MUST DECIDE WHO HAS 
LEGAL CLAIM TO A 6-MONTH-OLD ALEUT CHILD CAUGHT IN ADOPTION BATTLE. THE MOTHER 
IS FIGHTING THE TRIBE'S EFFORT TO GAIN CUSTODY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Aleut teen-ager lost a critical round in her unique custody battle against 
her native Alaskan tribe Friday when a Canadian judge ruled that she violated 
international law by smuggling her infant daughter to a British Columbia couple 
for adoption and ordered that the child be returned to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In a 28-page decision, Justice Ian Donald of the Supreme Court of British 
Columbia said that the province lacks jurisdiction to decide whether the Aleuts 
have legal claim to 6-month-old Rebecca Argleben. He said the matter should be 
worked out in California courts. 
</P>
<P>
The judge concluded that Rebecca's biological mother, Jodi Argleben, 18, 
violated a section of the Hague Convention that forbids the transportation of 
children across international lines to flout the law, and said Rebecca should 
be returned to California "promptly." 
</P>
<P>
"There are no villains in this piece," Donald wrote. "I am sure (Jodi) acted 
out of deep concern for the child without bad motive. The sincerity and 
generosity of the (prospective adoptive parents) can't be doubted. The tribe is 
not simply trying to make a point of principle; it genuinely wants to bring the 
child within its community if the mother does not want her. 
</P>
<P>
". . . I make my decision about jurisdiction fully conscious of the distress 
and disappointment it will cause, but I do so with the firm conviction that 
this American problem must be sorted out in California." 
</P>
<P>
Jodi, through her adoptive parents, repeated her earlier vow: that she will 
never surrender Rebecca to the Indian tribe. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian decision prompted immediate anguish from the baby's adoptive 
parents, a Vancouver couple whose identity has not been publicly disclosed. In 
his first public comment, the adoptive father told The Times he and his wife 
will seek an immediate order from a Canadian appeals court allowing them to 
keep Rebecca while the matter is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"This just tears the whole inside out of me," said the adoptive father, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. "The baby's totally bonded with us. She's got 
a family. I don't understand how the Indians could possibly inflict this hurt 
on the child. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's a little girl almost 7 months old. She's been in our family almost four 
months. How can anyone want to take this baby away from her family?" 
</P>
<P>
Jodi Argleben, who has been at an undisclosed location since giving Rebecca to 
the Canadian couple Sept. 15, could not be reached late Friday to discuss the 
ruling. But Ernest Argleben of Cypress, who with his wife adopted Jodi from her 
Aleut village when she was 3 years old and raised her, said Jodi will keep the 
baby herself rather than let the Aleut tribe in Alaska have her. 
</P>
<P>
"Jodi will never give the baby to the Indians," Ernest Argleben said. "I don't 
care what it takes. The Indians can scream, yell and holler. They'll never get 
this baby. If we lose all the battles, Jodi will keep Rebecca herself." 
</P>
<P>
Christian R. Van Deusen, Jodi's attorney in Orange County, said he will ask 
Superior Court Judge Robert J. Polis to permit the adoption to the Canadian 
couple. 
</P>
<P>
"The child was legitimately placed," he said. "There was no violation of the 
Hague Convention. Jodi was just exercising her constitutional right to place 
her child for adoption. She has no connection to the Indian tribe anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The novel case began in Orange County last summer, when Jodi, a single parent, 
filed suit to win permission to choose Rebecca's adoptive family. Before a 
decision was made, she withdrew that action and fled to Canada with the baby, 
then went into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
The Akhiok Tribal Council, which governs the tiny fishing village of Aleuts on 
Alaska's Kodiak Island, has intervened in Jodi's prospective adoption plans 
twice: once when she was still pregnant and had agreed to give her baby to a 
New York couple, and the second time in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Both times, the tribe has argued that the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act gives 
it the right to place the baby with a tribal family if the mother chooses not 
to raise the child. The law was designed to stem the breakup of Indian families 
and the loss of their customs. 
</P>
<P>
Jodi has fought that from the start, contending she did not want her baby 
raised in a poor village where she herself was abused by her biological parents 
before she was adopted by the Arglebens. She argued she severed her connection 
with the Indians long ago and should not be controlled by their wishes. 
</P>
<P>
The matter came before the Canadian court when the British Columbia adoption 
authorities sought guidance in resolving the dispute. An attorney appointed to 
represent Rebecca in Canada argued that she was thriving in her new home and 
should stay. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for the Canadian couple contended the tribe had no standing to 
intervene in a Canadian adoption. But Judge Donald did not have to decide that, 
because he ruled instead that Canada was not the place to resolve the matter. 
However, he indicated his leanings: 
</P>
<P>
"The tribe has custody rights (and) would have exercised them but for the 
removal of the child from the California jurisdiction," he said. ". . . The 
tribe has shown sufficient grounds for holding that it possesses 'rights of 
custody' within the meaning of the (Hague) Convention. The child has Indian 
ancestry. She is a member of the tribe. Her mother proposes to place her for 
adoption. These features establish a solid basis for the attribution of rights 
to the tribe." 
</P>
<P>
Bertram E. Hirsch, one of the New York attorneys who has represented the Aleuts 
in their fight against Jodi, said the Canadian decision is "extraordinary." He 
said he will now pursue the tribe's battle for Rebecca in Orange County courts. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows you can't take a baby out of the country in order to controvert the 
Indian Child Welfare Act," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Isabel and Ralph Rodriguez and their four young children have been living under 
siege. 
</P>
<P>
After 14 years of peace on a residential block in Santa Ana, the Rodriguez 
family witnessed one of Orange County's worst drive-by shootings last 
September. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since, members of a notorious street gang have terrorized the family to 
frighten it out of testifying against their "home boys." 
</P>
<P>
"We have been living three months now in pure hell," Isabel Rodriguez said 
Friday, her voice filled with frustration. "We have had firebombs thrown at us, 
handmade (Molotov) cocktails thrown through a window where my baby was 
sleeping. Now my children have to sleep on the floor because you never know if 
they'll come by shooting." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, 34, who flashes with anger as she talks about the gangs, said she 
refuses to give in. In a move she hopes will end the threats, Santa Ana police 
searched six houses, arresting one reputed gang member Thursday. Two others are 
sought. 
</P>
<P>
Richard (Sleepy) Ramirez, 21, of Santa Ana was booked on suspicion of assault 
with a deadly weapon, conspiracy and intimidation of a witness. Named in arrest 
warrants with the same charges were Randall Gilbert (Speedy) Martinez, 20, and 
Joel Villarreal (Chim Chim) Delarosa, 15, both of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
All three suspects, whose bail was set at $25,000 each, were identified in 
police records as members of the 5th Street gang. Police have authorization 
from the judge to arrest other members of the gang if implicated in the 
intimidation incidents. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged harassment stems from the night of Sept. 16, when reputed members 
of the 5th Street gang sprayed gunfire into a group standing in front of a 
house on Bonita Avenue in nearby Garden Grove as the Rodriguez family watched. 
Isabel Rodriguez's cousin, 4-year-old Frank Fernandez Jr., and a 17-year-old 
boy from the rival 17th Street gang were killed and several others were 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Three reputed members of the 5th Street gang are awaiting a preliminary hearing 
scheduled for February on murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
Isabel Rodriguez said the harassment started soon after the shooting. At first, 
she said, the gang members would drive by her modest brown house yelling, 
"Snitches!" and "Rats!" They would confront her young children with taunts and 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
"What are we snitching on?" she asked. "It was our family that was devastated 
and hurt. Do they want us to take a gang member's side over our own blood? 
</P>
<P>
"We feel like we're the ones who did the actual killing because of all the 
harassment we're getting. We should be harassing them for killing one of our 
family members. We want to see them behind bars if they did the killing." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, the family was not even safe in its front yard. Rodriguez said the gang 
members would drive in front of the house, point a gun at them and tell them to 
"move" -- and then drive away. 
</P>
<P>
The harassment escalated to nightly death threats, and a $3,000 contract was 
put out on Ralph Rodriguez's life, according to Santa Ana police reports filed 
Thursday in Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 9, one of the gang members allegedly tried to run down the Rodriguez's 
12-year-old son as he played football in the street, police reports said. 
</P>
<P>
"My son had to jump onto the curb to avoid being hit," Isabel Rodriguez said. 
The man reportedly yelled "5th Street" before speeding off. 
</P>
<P>
The next night, at about 11 p.m., Ralph Rodriguez, 32, told police that he was 
in the living room when he heard the sounds of "breaking glass and objects" 
hitting his house, police reports stated. 
</P>
<P>
When he went outside to investigate, he found six bottles of beer -- two of 
them shattered -- beside his house, reports said. Rodriguez said they appeared 
to have been thrown from Ramirez's house, and he told police earlier that 
evening he had seen Ramirez out front with another youth. Ramirez lives across 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
At about 11 p.m. on Nov. 11, according to police reports, the father of a local 
gang member came to the Rodriguez house and told Ralph Rodriguez to step 
outside "so that he could kill him." 
</P>
<P>
A firebomb was hurled at the house, but it bounced off a bedroom window and 
landed in the front yard. It was extinguished without causing serious damage, 
Isabel Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 21, police reports said, gang members in two cars and a truck drove by 
the Rodriguez household, shouting death threats and brandishing pistols. 
</P>
<P>
Early that afternoon, a young man identified by police as Martinez drove up as 
Ralph Rodriguez was standing on his front lawn and pointed a .38-caliber 
revolver at him, saying, "Ralph, I'm gonna kill you," police reports said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said he ran inside as Martinez's vehicle sped away. Martinez was 
arrested on suspicion of displaying a firearm later that afternoon by Santa Ana 
police and held in lieu of $500 bail, the reports said. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour after the arrest, a teen-ager identified by Ralph Rodriguez as 
Delarosa drove slowly by in a late-model pickup truck and yelled, "I'm going to 
get you," the reports said. Following closely behind was a carload of up to 
seven other young men, who shouted, "We are going to kill you," the reports 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police subsequently told the Rodriguez family that police patrols had 
been increased in their neighborhood. In addition, unmarked cars kept police in 
regular touch with a gang detail officer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the support from all of them that keeps us safe," Isabel Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Avdeef said the arrests show that Orange County police 
and prosecutors will not allow the justice system to be corrupted by gang 
threats. "If you intimidate witnesses, it makes a joke of the whole criminal 
justice system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While the family hopes the arrests will end the harassment, they vow to remain 
vigilant. 
</P>
<P>
"We are surrounded by 5th Street gang members," Isabel Rodriguez said. "In the 
day, we don't have any problems. At night, when we come in, I always look up 
and down the street to see if there's a car there or what. You never know. One 
day they might just come up behind you and shoot you."

REFUGEES: HAU NGUYEN, FREED FROM A VIETNAMESE RE-EDUCATION CAMP, FINALLY MADE

<TEXT>
<P>
For four years, Hau Nguyen was imprisoned in Vietnamese re-education camps. 
</P>
<P>
On a diet of only three ears of corn a day, the former South Vietnamese army 
captain was forced to hike 10 miles into the jungle, chop trees into 14-foot 
sections and drag them back to be sold by the Communists for firewood. 
</P>
<P>
When four of his left ribs were broken in a work accident, prisons officials 
decided in 1979 that the malnourished Nguyen was virtually useless, so they 
sent him back to his family in Ho Chi Minh City. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Nguyen built a boat and fled across the Pacific with his family and 26 
others. On Friday, the 61-year-old refugee now living in Garden Grove recalled 
those years as 300 former prisoners and their families arrived in Bangkok, the 
result of a long-awaited accord between Vietnam and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had always assumed that his countrymen in America had been working 
to free him and other political prisoners. But when he gained freedom, he found 
out that most of the Vietnamese refugees struggling to survive in a new land 
had forgotten the political and military detainees left behind. 
</P>
<P>
So Nguyen rallied the support of the Southern California Vietnamese communities 
and in 1985 founded the General Assn. of Former Political Prisoners of 
Vietnamese Communists. 
</P>
<P>
The group, with about 200 members in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego 
counties, is credited with pressing for an agreement, reached last July between 
Washington and Hanoi, that led this week to the release of the 300 prisoners 
and family members. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw that nothing was getting done if the political prisoners relied on those 
who had gone ahead," Nguyen said, sitting on what used to be his back porch but 
now serves as headquarters of his association. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen, a machine operator before being laid off three years ago, now is 
supported by his five children as he devotes all his time to helping a 
seemingly endless list of families work to have their loved ones brought to 
freedom. He has written thousands of letters to political figures, attended 
international conferences on the plight of the detainees and lobbied everyone 
who he thought could lend a hand. 
</P>
<P>
His desk and the shelves around the room are filled with manila folders 
containing the stories of thousands of detainees. On the walls are framed 
petitions and resolutions from state and federal officials applauding his 
efforts and pledging their assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Also framed and hanging on a wall is an invitation to President Bush's 
inauguration. He says he wanted to attend but did not have the money to go to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I and others in my group are only volunteers, after all," Nguyen said. "We 
(will be) repaid when all of the Vietnamese political prisoners are released." 
</P>
<P>
That process began Friday, when the first group of freed detainees arrived at 
the Bangkok airport. 
</P>
<P>
The former prisoners included high-ranking former South Vietnamese miliary 
officers, bureaucrats and soldiers who spent years in the Vietnamese gulags. 
More than half are reportedly bound for California. Resettlement officials in 
Southern California confirmed that at least 70 people were headed for Los 
Angeles County and that 63 or so are planning to join relatives who have 
settled in Orange County. A State Department spokesman in Bangkok said the 
first emigres could arrive as early as next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 former detainees and their families have applied to the U.S. 
Embassy in Bangkok for permission to emigrate, according to Robert Funseth, 
senior deputy assistant secretary of state. He said the United States expects 
700 people to leave Vietnam this month and up to 7,000 to be resettled here by 
September. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen said that it is crucial for his group to encourage Washington to 
continue pressuring Hanoi for the speedy release of the approximately 200,000 
people still being held in about 183 re-education camps. "It has already been 
nearly 15 years and we need to get them out," he stressed. 
</P>
<P>
"By leaving us behind, I think the American government mistreated its brothers 
in arms, but I also believe that mistreatment has been compensated somewhat 
through the July accord."

BOMB THREATS SENT TO GOVERNMENT UNITS

<P>
The FBI is investigating what agents described as "a plurality of bomb threats" 
that have been mailed from Santa Ana to more than a dozen state and federal 
government agencies across the country. 
</P>
<P>
FBI spokesman Fred Reagan said the bureau could not release specific details of 
the investigation beyond disclosing that it was centered in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged that between 12 and 20 government agencies have received 
the bomb threats. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Moyer, an administrator at the Nevada state division of unclaimed 
property, said he received a copy of the bomb threat when he opened his morning 
mail Thursday. The letter contained the message, "Consider this as a bomb 
threat." 
</P>
<P>
Moyer said that the letter was unsigned and that it was mailed from Santa Ana 
on Dec. 29. "It was handwritten on plain white paper," he said. "It's a mystery 
why someone has a grudge against the unclaimed property division." 
</P>
<P>
Moyer said Nevada officials are taking the threat seriously. He said that an 
emergency response plan has been revised and that the division's employees were 
setting aside suspicious-looking packages that arrive in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
Officials were unavailable for comment on how California agencies were 
reacting. 
</P>
<P>
Moyer said checks by the Nevada agency revealed that divisions of unclaimed 
property in other states had received the same threat. DAVAN MAHARAJ

OFFICIALS DISCUSS IMPROVING HIGHWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials this week discussed developing Imperial Highway into a "super 
street," with improvements designed to help traffic flow in the city, which has 
no freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Fortune, Orange County Transportation Commission public affairs officer, 
said a super street is "something less than a freeway but the most efficient 
surface street possible." 
</P>
<P>
Possible improvements from Beach Boulevard to Santa Ana Canyon Road include 
widening of the highway, addition or improvements to signals, construction of 
bus turnouts, consolidation of driveways and removal of on-street parking, 
Fortune said. 
</P>
<P>
The council also appointed Mayor Beth Graham to act as liaison in the planning 
process that is expected to be completed by September. 
</P>
<P>
If the project is approved, construction is expected to begin sometime in 1992.

<P>
Construction of an office building on a piece of prime commercial property will 
begin in March despite arguments by some city officials that the parcel should 
be used for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The council passed ordinances this week paving the way for McMullen Publishing 
to build a new office building on Placentia Avenue adjacent to Brian Chuchua's 
Jeep Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a welcome addition for the city," said Peter Gustaf, attorney for both 
McMullen Publishing and Brian Chuchua's Jeep. "Their organization will be a 
real plus factor for the city." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Maria Moreno said she favors the site but had long considered 
the spot to be ideal for senior housing. 
</P>
<P>
"In all honesty, I am disappointed that we couldn't see a business that would 
provide a service for the people," Moreno said. 
</P>
<P>
The office building will occupy space now used by the auto dealership as a 
helicopter landing pad. McMullen Publishing, which publishes automotive 
magazines, will employ architecture called "different" and "modern" by Joyce 
Rosenthal, director of development services. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something we haven't seen before in Placentia," Rosenthal said. "It will 
be a very good-looking building." JULIE ESPY

MAN GETS 25 YEARS IN MURDER CONSPIRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A judge sentenced a New York man to 25 years to life in prison Friday for 
conspiracy to commit murder in the Dixie Dyson case, despite pleas for leniency 
from five of his jurors who now say they may have made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the jurors acquitted George Ira Lamb of a murder charge in the Nov. 
17, 1984, stabbing death of Mel Dyson at his Huntington Harbour condominium. 
But they did convict Lamb, 27, of conspiracy to commit murder by planning it 
with Dixie Dyson, the victim's common-law wife, and her boyfriend, Enrico 
Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of the jurors were surprised later to learn that conspiracy carries 
the same 25-year sentence as murder. Several said they would have voted to 
acquit Lamb of both counts if they had known the penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Dixie Dyson has already been convicted of murder and conspiracy in the killing, 
and Vasquez's trial is expected to begin in March. Dyson, the key witness 
against Lamb, is not expected to be sentenced until after she testifies at 
Vasquez's trial. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin on Friday denied a request by Lamb's 
attorney, Deputy Public Defender Jeff Lund, to give the defendant a break on 
sentencing in light of the jurors' reaction and Lamb's clean record. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I see on the surface, Mr. Lamb is an upstanding young man," McCartin 
said. "But this was a cold, calculated, first-degree murder straight up. They 
planned it; they got results." 
</P>
<P>
Juror Tony J. LaPetina of Garden Grove wrote that a 25-year sentence for Lamb 
would be "outrageous and inappropriate." Juror Colleen M. Brown of Buena Park 
wrote, "I do not feel it is fair that he (Lamb) should be forced to serve the 
same sentence as Dixie, who was convicted of the murder, which I feel is a 
worse crime." 
</P>
<P>
The five jurors made their comments in written responses to a questionnaire 
from Lund's office. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors all stated they believed Lamb had withdrawn from the conspiracy and 
that both Dixie Dyson and Enrico Vasquez were aware he had withdrawn. They all 
said that if they had been given a jury instruction on conspiracy withdrawal, 
they would not have voted Lamb guilty of conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
But McCartin told the lawyers he could not legally consider their comments. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for the judge was that although lawyers are allowed to interview 
jurors afterward, they cannot then return to court with information that the 
jurors have since second-guessed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles J. Middleton, who prosecuted Lamb, said that jurors, 
after rendering their verdict, are no longer unbiased observers and are subject 
to outside influences. 
</P>
<P>
"It was obvious several of the jurors were sympathetic to Lamb," Middleton 
said, noting that Lamb's young wife and 3-year-old son were in court during 
much of the trial. "It's not surprising they might try to rationalize their 
decision once they found out the penalty for conspiracy." 
</P>
<P>
Lund said he should have asked the judge during the trial to include an 
instruction to jurors on withdrawal from a conspiracy. Lund said he didn't, 
because it never occurred to him that the jurors would vote differently between 
conspiracy and murder. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend Dixie Dyson and Vasquez wanted Mel Dyson dead because she 
could collect more than $200,000 on his life insurance. Dixie Dyson testified 
that Lamb not only agreed to participate for an undetermined share of the 
insurance but was the actual killer who carried out the plan. 
</P>
<P>
While several jurors did feel strongly that Lamb was involved, they said they 
acquitted Lamb on the murder charge because Dyson's testimony about the killing 
could not be corroborated. But there were motel receipts and other evidence of 
corroboration to back her claims that he was in California just before the 
murder and involved in the conspiracy, they said. JERRY HICKSb

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Services will be conducted today for Maybelle Spencer, a former Anaheim city 
treasurer, who died Wednesday of Parkinson's disease at Chapman Harbor 
Convalescent Center in Garden Grove. She was 84. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Spencer was the last treasurer to be elected by city voters. She had 
succeeded her father in the position of deputy treasurer after his death in 
June, 1955. Her father had held the post since 1940. 
</P>
<P>
She was elected to three successive terms as treasurer until 1964, when Anaheim 
became a chartered city and the treasurer's post became an appointed position. 
She retired from office in 1973 but continued to be active in such 
organizations as the Municipal Tax Assn., the Women's Division of the Chamber 
of Commerce and the Rebecca Lodge of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Spencer, a graduate of Anaheim High School, is credited with developing a 
licensing ordinance that served as a blueprint for other Orange County 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by a daughter, Jo Anne Spencer of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Services will be at 1 p.m. at Bachs-Kaulbars Baggott and Schacht Anaheim 
Mortuary, 1617 W. La Palma Ave.

A news conference turned into a shouting match Friday between opponents of the 
Irvine Co.'s proposed 12,000-home development in east Orange and proponents who 
held the conference and accused critics of using "outside anti-growth" leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Theodore Botens, president of the Rural Orange Coordinated Council, composed of 
10 homeowner groups that have endorsed the development, was repeatedly 
interrupted as he stood on the steps of City Hall and tried to characterize 
citizens against the development as either "outsiders" or people who did not 
attend any of the city's hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very obvious to me that these outside people have a slow-growth agenda," 
Botens said amid shouts of "You're wrong! You're wrong!" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm against the wording of one of their flyers that said this plan will divide 
the city," Botens said. 
</P>
<P>
One of those who disagreed with Botens was Dorothy Hudecek, who lives in 
Orange. She attended the news conference to hear what Botens had to say and was 
not planning on making any statements. But when Botens characterized some 
organizers as "anti-growth outsiders," she said she saw red. 
</P>
<P>
"I resent people like Ted Botens describing me as anti-growth," she said, loud 
enough for Botens to hear. "I'm not anti-growth, and petition organizers are 
not anti-growth. We're residents concerned about added traffic congestion that 
this development will bring. . . . As for not attending any city meetings on 
the issue, I've attended almost every single one." 
</P>
<P>
The outburst was an example of some of the emotions that have boiled over among 
residents as a result of the Irvine Co.'s proposal to turn 7,100 acres of open 
land into a sea of 12,300 homes, a hotel and major recreational facilities over 
the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Hudecek was part of a group that, along with reporters, ringed Botens, Nicky 
Calagna of the Orange Taxpayers Assn., and Robert Walters, a member of the 
Rural Orange Coordinated Council, during the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Hudecek is a member of the Five Coves Conservancy, which is one of several 
groups helping to organize a petition drive to collect 5,500 signatures by Jan. 
18. They want to put the development issue on the city's June ballot. 
Organizers said they became frustrated when the City Council voted unanimously 
Dec. 19 to approve an amendment adding the development to the city's General 
Plan. The proposal has been the subject of negotiations for 3 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Petition organizers, including Carole Walters of Orange (no relation to Robert 
Walters), have taken exception to Botens' comments praising the development and 
criticizing those who disagree because they were not part of the 
decision-making process. 
</P>
<P>
Carole Walters said she is fearful that the development, which would increase 
the city's population by an estimated 40% and bring in 25,000 new jobs, would 
drastically alter the city she now knows by dividing the older housing sections 
in west Orange from the new subdivisions in east Orange. 
</P>
<P>
After the conference, Botens said he favored the project because it had 
included jogging and horse trails, open space and two parks, all suggestions 
made by his east Orange neighborhood known as Orange Park Acres and other 
homeowner groups. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry Meddick, who lives in nearby Silverado Canyon and is against the 
development, said petition organizers plan to step up their fight next week. 
Although she said she was confident that enough signatures would be obtained to 
qualify a referendum, she and other organizers did not have any estimates on 
the number of signatures already obtained.

Neale Stoner, a former athletic director at Cal State Fullerton and Illinois, 
was named executive director of the California Raisin Bowl on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Stoner, 53, will take over Feb. 1 from Glen Driscoll, who is retiring as head 
of the first of each winter's college bowl football games. 
</P>
<P>
Stoner was chosen from 70 applicants, said John Wallace, president of the 
sponsoring Greater San Joaquin Valley Sports Assn. 
</P>
<P>
As athletic director at Fullerton in the late 1970s, Stoner helped launch the 
Cal Bowl, which began in 1981 at Fresno's Bulldog Stadium. The game annually 
matches the champions of the Big West and Mid-American conferences. 
</P>
<P>
Stoner was athletic director at Illinois from 1979 through 1988. He resigned in 
July, 1988, after he had been accused of improper use of gifts and services. 
Stoner and other athletic department administrators was charged with receiving 
personal favors from university maintenance workers who were on company time. 
He also was accused of paying for vacations with athletic department funds.

TEACHERS EXPAND SCIENCE SKILLS IN COURSES, INCLUDING GARBAGE STUDY;

EDUCATION: INSTRUCTORS FIND HANDS-ON METHOD OF SCIENCE NOT ONLY ENCOURAGES

Fourteen elementary school teachers from the metropolitan area gather at the 
Museum of Science in Boston to sort through garbage. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the project -- dubbed "garbology" -- is to make hypotheses about 
whose garbage it is. "This will be great in the classroom," said Ann Harney, a 
teacher from Beverly, Mass. "If garbage and mess are involved, the kids will 
love it." 
</P>
<P>
As teachers sift through discarded panty hose, used envelopes, newspapers, 
batteries and a cereal box, they draw conclusions from the evidence and later 
learn how close their hypotheses came to fact. They are working like scientists 
and learning to be better teachers in the process. 
</P>
<P>
The project was part of the Museum Institute for Teaching Science, a two-week 
program in its fourth year of helping elementary school teachers become more 
science literate. The program's philosophy is that if teachers have a positive 
attitude toward science, their students will reflect that attitude whether or 
not they are scientifically inclined. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers are sent to one of eight participating area museums, including the New 
England Aquarium, the Massachusetts Audubon Society, the Manomet Bird 
Observatory and the Children's Museum. The museums are sponsored by the 
National Science Foundation and a number of science-related companies 
interested in the development of the future work force. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers become students and spend their days "doing science," rather than 
reading or teaching it from a textbook. They leave with notebooks full of ways 
to introduce science into the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Mary McClellen, a sixth-grade teacher from East Somerville Community School in 
Somerville, Mass., enjoyed her first summer in the program so much that she 
returned for a second round this year. After being told last year that her 
school would departmentalize, McClellen decided science was one of the courses 
she wanted to continue teaching. "I said I wanted to stick with science," she 
said. "Two years ago, if anyone told me I would be saying that, I would have 
told them they were crazy." 
</P>
<P>
According to Beverly Perna, Museum of Science outreach program coordinator, the 
goal of the various museums is to get the teachers to realize the value of 
interdisciplinary teaching. Instead of sitting before a classroom of young 
children and saying, "Now it's time to read, now it's time to do math," 
teachers should let one course naturally flow from another, she said. Science 
does not have to be simply science in the traditional sense of the word; it can 
be integrated into the curriculum with any subject that an elementary school 
teacher normally teaches, Perna said. 
</P>
<P>
An exercise in making cartouches (ancient Egyptian nameplates, which royalty 
wore as necklace ornaments) involves not only the scientific inquiry necessary 
to decipher unknown symbols and codes, but also leads the class to discussions 
and lessons in history, social studies and language, with more than a little 
art thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Wolman of Randolph, Mass., has always taught with a hands-on approach to 
science, but the museum institute has helped her integrate science with other 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, I would have the kids do an experiment, or demonstrate an 
experiment, and that would be that. Now, I have them write about their 
experiences afterward and get them to use their language skills." 
</P>
<P>
"The importance of science is a sense of discovery," said Harney, who has spent 
parts of three summers with the museum institute. "Young kids are at the stage 
where science is fun. They know if we see an unusual bird in the field, we are 
going to go out and look at it." 
</P>
<P>
Like most of the teachers in the program (90% of whom are women), Harney had 
very little science training. 
</P>
<P>
"We're striving for a more science-literate nation," said Amy Stevenson, 
director of public relations at the National Science Teachers Assn. in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the organization, Stevenson said, is to promote the science 
profession. It sponsors several teacher workshops similar to the museum 
institute and certifies teachers who have limited science backgrounds, but who 
are competing in an environment that increasingly values a science education. 
</P>
<P>
To become certified, a teacher must complete 12 semester hours of science 
courses, including labs, field work and student teaching. "Teachers are finally 
able to say with confidence, 'Yes, I have a science background,' " Stevenson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Elementary school kids are not afraid of science," said Ann Donofrio, a 
teacher from Randolph, Mass. It is often the teacher who does not feel 
experienced or smart enough to teach the subject, she says. One of the reasons 
the museum institute and programs like it work is that they become research 
centers for teachers to turn to throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Science has become a hot topic," said Frank Gardner, executive director of the 
museum institute. The program has extended invitations to other museums to 
visit the workshops and use them as a training program.

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: QUIXOTE PRESS WAS INDEED AN IMPOSSIBLE DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
They began their publishing adventure in the Spring of 1988 with the best of 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of Quixote Press, the student-run publishing house at Orange Coast 
College, was to publish a first-time novelist's manuscript by the end of the 
fall semester. 
</P>
<P>
The students -- members of writing instructor Raymond Obstfeld's How to Publish 
class -- sent flyers soliciting manuscripts to college creative writing classes 
in Orange, Los Angeles and San Diego counties. But word of the fledgling 
publishing house's search spread throughout the state and some submissions even 
came from as far as New York. 
</P>
<P>
Forty manuscripts were received, and "Max Golly," a comic novel by Rick Drager, 
a Davis piano teacher in the creative writing program at UC Davis, was selected 
for publication. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next few months, publishing class members conducted a cover design 
contest through college and high school art departments, edited Drager's 
manuscript, worked on a distribution plan and -- most important -- sought 
donations to pay for printing costs. 
</P>
<P>
But the December, 1988, deadline came and went. 
</P>
<P>
So what's become of Quixote Press and "Max Golly"? 
</P>
<P>
At last word in early 1988, Drager was continuing to rewrite portions of his 
novel, and the students were continuing their efforts to raise the $8,000 
needed for a 1,500-copy first printing. 
</P>
<P>
And therein lay the downfall of Quixote Press. 
</P>
<P>
Despite an initial $2,000 donated by Obstfeld -- and another $550 from other 
sources -- Quixote Press unceremoniously folded last June. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a nice project, and we felt confident we could raise the money from the 
arts patrons around here, but we just could not raise the money to put it out," 
said Vernon Pitsker, a member of the student steering committee overseeing the 
publishing house. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people promised money, and then they didn't come through. That was a 
tough lesson for us," said Alexis Brown, who served as the primary editor. 
</P>
<P>
What began as a 10-person student steering committee had, by the end, dwindled 
to just Pitsker and Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"Like any project, you have great hopes for it in the beginning, and when it 
doesn't come around, you always have that feeling of regret," Pitsker said. "I 
suppose if we still had the momentum of participation, it may have moved 
forward, but there were just two of us left. We just said, 'We can't handle 
this ourselves.' It just came down to money and lack of participation." 
</P>
<P>
"We learned an incredible amount," Brown said, laughing: "We learned the 
publishing business is tough." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good experience, and the thing was I felt really bad we couldn't 
finish it," Brown added. "Our intention was, 'No matter what, we're going to 
get it published.' That we had to abandon it was the most disappointing thing, 
because it was a good little book and it deserved to be published." 
</P>
<P>
Obstfeld stresses, however, that the demise of Quixote Press should not be seen 
as a complete failure. 
</P>
<P>
If its success or failure is going to be measured solely by whether "Max Golly" 
was published or not, he said, "then we've lost the point: To learn how to do 
something and try for it. The students learned as much as they did or didn't 
because they went through the process. That's the whole point of college." 
</P>
<P>
Obstfeld, who served as adviser, said the students learned how to select a 
manuscript, how to edit, budget and plan distribution. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was there -- except the extra money," Obstfeld said. "It's not that 
it couldn't be done. All the expertise was there, but part of my philosophy was 
(that) I wasn't going to do it for them; that wasn't the goal. The goal was for 
everybody to see how it's done and accept the responsibility: If you don't do 
it, it doesn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
If the students benefited by the experience, Drager also came out ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said that, in addition to a $500 advance, Drager received "a lot of good 
editing." 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was disappointed," she said, "but we were real up-front with him 
from the beginning, so I don't think he was totally distraught. I think he has 
a real good chance with publishing it elsewhere. We did quite a bit of editing. 
We made a lot of suggestions, and he made a lot of changes based on our 
suggestions." 
</P>
<P>
Reached by phone in Woodland, Calif., where he now lives, Drager, 40, 
acknowledged that he was disappointed when he was told that his novel would not 
be published. But he takes the demise of Quixote Press philosophically, quoting 
a Writer's Market estimate that about 25% of all small presses fail each year. 
</P>
<P>
"I got some good help with the book," he said as one of his piano students 
played in the background. "This time last year, I was trying to beat a deadline 
they had given me to finish their rewrites. It was mostly a matter of kind of 
clarifying some of the characters, especially toward the end of the book -- 
keeping them more consistent." 
</P>
<P>
Drager has by no means abandoned his novel. 
</P>
<P>
He linked up with a Boston literary agent in November, and his manuscript, 
retitled "Chasing Cagney," is making the rounds of major New York publishers. 
Unlike other first-time authors he knows whose agents have asked them to 
rewrite their novels, Drager said his agent did not ask for any changes. "The 
book is kind of in a workmanlike condition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And if his agent is not lucky with the major publishers, Drager said, "I'll 
start hitting the small publishers again." 
</P>
<P>
Small or large, it doesn't make that much difference to Drager. 
</P>
<P>
"I do look at a published book as a published book since this is my first step 
out," he said. "It would be nice to have that on my resume."

ROOTERS GOING THE DISTANCE FOR RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There are fans of the Los Angeles Rams football team. And then there are folks 
like Ron Lais and Joan Ann Faria. 
</P>
<P>
Lais, with his wife and son, and Faria climbed on a plane at Los Angeles 
International Airport on Friday and flew to that flower among American cities 
-- Newark, N.J. All for the chance to sit in a stadium built on a former 
garbage dump, a stadium where Jimmy Hoffa may be buried, a stadium where the 
wind roars in winter like it's turbocharged -- even when it doesn't snow. And 
all so they can root for their Rams in a playoff game Sunday against the New 
York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
(Yes, the New York Giants do happen to play in New Jersey, a whole 'nother 
state. But then the Los Angeles Rams do happen to play in Anaheim, a whole 
'nother city in a whole 'nother county.) 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so excited my stomach hurts," Faria said before boarding the plane. "I 
have been a devout Rams fan for 30 years . . . and finally I've got enough 
money saved up that I can see them," even if it means flying across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Lais, a Santa Ana lawyer who lives in Anaheim Hills, figures that if there is 
such a thing as "Rams Fever" these days, "I've probably got it about as bad as 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Lais said the flight, football tickets and hotel not far from the stadium cost 
$500 per person. The Laises, Faria and three others are part of a contingent of 
seven Rams Booster Club members journeying east for the game. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Ort, president of All-Travel Service in Anaheim and a charter member of the 
booster group, packaged the weekend journey. He said he could have picked up 
more tickets but many people are looking beyond the Meadowlands, to San 
Francisco or Minneapolis-St. Paul, and to New Orleans. If the Rams win Sunday, 
they go to San Francisco or Minnesota next weekend to play the winner of 
today's game between the Vikings and the 49ers. Should the Rams win again, they 
go to the city of jazz and jambalaya for the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of people are enthused, but I also think a certain amount of 
them believe the Rams are going all the way and are saving their money for the 
Super Bowl in New Orleans," Ort said. He's skipping the trip because he's 
installing a new computer system in his office. 
</P>
<P>
But those who stay in Orange County won't be far from a television set Sunday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be at home, and I've invited our kids over and have a quick 
little brunch after it's completed," said Supervisor Don R. Roth, a former 
Anaheim mayor, sports buff and occasional occupant of the Anaheim Stadium box 
of Rams owner Georgia Frontiere. 
</P>
<P>
Businessman John Crean and his wife, Donna, are having a group of two dozen or 
so over to their new home that's still being built in Santa Ana Heights, 
according to Lois Lundberg, who is organizing the party for the Creans. 
</P>
<P>
The key to wangling an invitation, Lundberg said, "is you have to be a great 
Rams fan. You have to do a lot of cheering." 
</P>
<P>
The Crean home, overlooking the Back Bay, will have 45,000 square feet when 
it's done and will sport its own movie theater, which will be the site for 
Sunday's game-watchers. 
</P>
<P>
Crean "is frequently in Georgia's box cheering the Rams when they're in Los 
Angeles so he's doing his part while they're going to New York," Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Rams Booster Club members are expected to get together at a Garden Grove 
restaurant to view the game, according to the club's executive director, Mary 
Jane Stratman. In fact, the restaurant is opening early because the game starts 
at 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Stratman said the club has 1,800 members, who pay $25 per person or $40 per 
couple to belong. The club has a newsletter, tailgate parties at Anaheim 
stadium, a breakfast with Coach John Robinson, a dinner-dance with the Ram 
coaching staff, a picnic and a golf tournament that raises funds for county 
charities each year. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the road trips. 
</P>
<P>
Especially to New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got done taking 210 (people) to New Orleans," Ort said. "After the 
Rams won that game, at around midnight, with our (Rams) banner and the Ram 
horns, we marched down Bourbon Street from one end to the other and into Pat 
O'Brien's, where we asked if they had a table for 200. . . . We celebrated the 
victory while the Rams were on their way home in the plane." 
</P>
<P>
Lais was part of the crowd in New Orleans for the Nov. 26 Rams game. He went to 
San Francisco too. And Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
He said there have been occasions when he has flown his own plane to Knoxville, 
Tenn., and to Norman, Okla., to watch USC play. But he didn't go to a Rams game 
until they moved to Anaheim 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Rams have inspired him to go to New York for the first time in 34 years 
-- despite some concerns about the legendary New York-area fans. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughters performed a few years ago at Shea Stadium at halftime" of a Jets 
football game, Lais said. "They were in a drill team, and I guess they had to 
have a lot of security because people were so crazy, tipping over the buses and 
weird stuff." As a result, Lais figured he will "maintain a relatively low 
profile" at the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Faria, who works as a "professional temporary . . . (helping) people organize 
their businesses," said she has a New York native now working in her Long Beach 
office who "is about ready to choke me" because of her football loyalties. 
"Every time he comes in he hits me. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have a fabulous time," she said before takeoff. "It's just too 
exciting." 
</P>
<P>
But won't it be cold? 
</P>
<P>
"I have a mink coat that I never get to wear. And I'm wearing my mink coat. And 
my ski suit." Not to the game, but into Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Across the river from the stadium, on Central Park South, Rams spokesman 
Marshall Klein said from his hotel room that although some of Frontiere's 
friends had traveled to the game, "I wouldn't say chartered airliners are being 
loaded up" with Rams rooters. 
</P>
<P>
Still, "obviously, Mrs. Frontiere is thrilled as she can be with the 
performance of her team. . . . It's been quite a season for all of us. 
</P>
<P>
"We would love to have just two more cracks and be there Jan. 28 in New 
Orleans," Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
If it happens, said Klein and Ort and Stratman and Lais and Faria, then you'll 
really see Rams fever.

<P>
When Anita Madsen and her friend, Tina Harboe, walked into Kokomos, a 
Chippendales-style club in Irvine, they bumped into a dozen other young Danish 
women -- all au pairs like themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"It was amazing," said Madsen, a 21-year-old from the village of Hjorring. 
"Denmark is such a small country and they all seem to be here." 
</P>
<P>
And it's true. Orange County, with the state's second-highest population of 
children, is also one of the most sought-after destinations for college-age 
Scandinavians and other Europeans who choose the life of the au pair, loosely 
translated from French as "on par" or "equal with." 
</P>
<P>
These young men and women seek a break from their college studies, taking a 
year off to study American culture firsthand: fast food and freeways, malls and 
movies. In exchange for lodging, a little pocket money and weekends off, 
they'll baby-sit the kids and do a bit of dusting. 
</P>
<P>
It's impossible to know exactly just how many au pairs are in the United 
States, since most entered the country on tourist visas and are working here 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike most of their Scandinavian sisters, Madsen and Harboe are different: 
They're legally here, brought in through a fledgling cultural-exchange program 
administered by the U.S. Information Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Under USIA program rules, host families pay an up-front cost of about $3,000, 
which includes air fare, orientation and $300 toward education -- au pairs must 
take some type of academic class once they're here. Au pairs also get a 
tax-free stipend of $100 a week. 
</P>
<P>
When Madsen and Harboe arrived in the United States last summer, visas in hand, 
they were part of a platoon-load of newly arrived au pairs. When greeters from 
their sponsoring agency dealt out the domestic airline tickets, they were the 
only ones in their groups headed for Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"I had always wanted to come here," said 19-year-old Harboe. "We didn't have 
any say in where we would go -- I just got lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Madsen, who came in June, and Harboe, who arrived a month later, were part of 
the first classes flown in by the Laguna Beach-based EurAuPair, a nonprofit 
foundation operated by the American Scandinavian Student Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Operated out of a converted apartment that overlooks Main Beach, EurAuPair is 
one of only eight groups authorized by the USIA to bring au pairs into the 
United States and the only one in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
And while Los Angeles and its suburbs are the favored destinations, the area is 
behind its sophisticated Eastern sisters of New York and Boston in the demand 
for au pairs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's relatively new here," said Tammy Fisher, western regional director for 
EurAuPair, which placed 500 au pairs by year's end. While the nonprofit 
organization has placed au pairs in 30 cities throughout the United States, 
only 40 were in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"Every one back East knows about au pairs," she said. "But it's not as true 
here. We could use lots more families -- especially Southern California 
families." 
</P>
<P>
While Joanna Cappelle of El Toro was thumbing through the Saddleback Valley 
News last spring, Anita Madsen was a junior college student back in Hjorring, 
mulling her career ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
For Cappelle, something in the newspaper just clicked. It was an ad for 
EurAuPair, and it offered a better solution than after-school programs for her 
two children, Diana, 6, and David, 11. 
</P>
<P>
For Madsen, something clicked in a conversation with her neighbor. The best way 
to enhance her chances for a job in international banking, the neighbor 
suggested, was to get practical experience using English. 
</P>
<P>
What got them together was Foreign Operations Appropriation Bill 2757. Passed 
in September 1988, the bill greatly expanded what had been a two-year 
experimental program administered by two East Coast agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The new program increased the number of agencies to eight, and each of these 
nonprofit groups is permitted to bring in as many as 2,840 au pairs annually on 
J-1 cultural exchange visas. 
</P>
<P>
"I had always wanted an au pair, but I just couldn't hire an illegal," said 
Cappelle, a native of Australia. "I would never exploit someone like that." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to come over illegally," said Madsen, who knows countless other 
Danish girls who used trans-Atlantic neighborhood "networks" to hook up with 
American families as illegal au pairs. Others had told her exactly what to do 
to get through the sometimes-tough U.S. immigration. "Have a round-trip ticket 
and pack a letter in your suitcase from your 'Auntie.' And never tell them 
you're going to work -- say you're a tourist," recited Madsen. A few years ago, 
Madsen was a high school exchange student in Upstate New York, and entering the 
United States on false pretenses just didn't appeal to her. 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard about EurAuPair, I filled out an application. It was perfect." 
</P>
<P>
Anita's three-page application was on the top of the pile for Don and Joanna 
Cappelle. They liked her letter, her age (at 21 she's older than most), her 
previous child-care experience and the smiling face that beamed out of the 
color snapshots. 
</P>
<P>
The chemistry has worked. "I just love this family," says Madsen. And the 
family loves her. An eight-foot-long "Welcome" banner graces Anita's 
second-floor bedroom. On her bedside desk sits a handmade pine name plaque -- a 
gift from woodwork hobbyist Don. 
</P>
<P>
Mornings at the tree-shaded Cappelle home are Anita's. While the kids are in 
school, Anita takes a stationary spin on the Lifecycle or a swim at the nearby 
Sun and Sail Club. After doing some grocery shopping or light housework, 
Anita's real work begins. It's 2:30, school is out, and Anita is off and 
running in the family's blue Volvo. 
</P>
<P>
If it's Monday, it's science class for David. Wednesday is tennis. Tuesdays and 
Thursdays are soccer practice for Diana. Friday is ballet. 
</P>
<P>
At night, Madsen shares dinner with the family, then settles down to the 
television (she likes "Cosby" and "L.A. Law") and does a little knitting. 
</P>
<P>
Weekends are for sightseeing. Harboe and Madsen load up the Volvo and they're 
off -- to Disneyland (twice), the beach (also twice), Sea World and to Marilyn 
Monroe's grave. Both felt a twinge of homesickness when they drove to Solvang 
-- the Danish immigrant village in the Santa Ynez Mountains. "It was wonderful 
to walk down Copenhagen Drive and see the Danish flag," said Madsen, who used 
the trip to buy a little piece of home -- 10 packs of SorBits, a Danish chewing 
gum. 
</P>
<P>
The employers of Harboe and Madsen say that the girls were answers to their 
prayers, but not all such matches are heavenly -- on either side of the 
equation. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a friend who's here (illegally) who is very unhappy," Harboe said. "She 
just sits in her room -- there's no one to talk to. But if we have a problem, 
we just call Vince." 
</P>
<P>
Vince O'Hanlon of Dana Point wears a beeper -- and not just because he's a 
mortgage banker. 
</P>
<P>
O'Hanlon is one of several volunteer community counselors for EurAuPair. And as 
such, he is part Dad, part Dutch uncle to a dozen or so au pairs. 
</P>
<P>
In the illegal world of au pairs, horror stories abound. One family made their 
au pair sleep in the garage. Another paid only $35 a week. Then there are the 
au pairs who see living in the United States as one big vacation -- cruising 
the bars every night until midnight. Or storming out, bags packed at 9 a.m. on 
a Monday morning, leaving the parents in a sitter panic. 
</P>
<P>
But the legal programs are designed to minimize those problems with screening 
and orientation for both parent and au pair. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of expectations on both sides," Fisher said. "The au pair 
expects a 'Leave It to Beaver' family and it doesn't always turn out that way." 
</P>
<P>
Before the young women (98% are women) even come over, O'Hanlon interviews the 
prospective host family. He sizes up their finances, their homes -- au pairs 
must have a separate bedroom -- and general suitability. According to Fisher, 
EurAuPair's typical Orange County applicant is an affluent two-career couple 
from South Orange County with one or two young children. 
</P>
<P>
European care-givers appeal to them, Fisher says, because of their cultural and 
educational backgrounds and English proficiency. Some even hope that the au 
pair will teach their children a foreign language. "They can even choose the 
country," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
In Europe, prospective au pairs are also screened. All must be between 18 and 
25, speak English, have the equivalent of a high school diploma, some 
child-care experience and a driver's license. They also put down a $500 deposit 
as a good-faith guarantee that they'll give a year's commitment to the program. 
</P>
<P>
During their orientation programs in the United States, "we tell them what to 
expect. And other (au pairs) are there to talk about their experiences," 
O'Hanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
Problems inevitably occur when the au pair must bend to fit into the family 
fold. 
</P>
<P>
"The No. 1 problem is getting the children's trust. It just takes a while to 
adjust," says O'Hanlon. Another is homesickness. 
</P>
<P>
To help the au pairs get to know each other, O'Hanlon circulates a telephone 
list. He also makes frequent 'hi-how-are-you' phone checks. But domestic crises 
can blow up in a hurry -- and for the desperate au pair or family -- there's 
always O'Hanlon's beeper. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher estimates that 15% of placements don't work out. EurAuPair tries to find 
another host family, but if it can't, the au pair must return home -- as was 
the case of the program's only male applicant, a young German man who had lived 
with an Irvine family for a few unhappy weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The USIA rules also call for reciprocity -- each organization that brings in 
Europeans must also seek out young Americans who want to serve as au pairs 
abroad. EurAuPair has fewer than a dozen applications on file, and as of now, 
no European families who want them. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would they want to hire an American?" says Fisher. "They can get other 
European girls so much cheaper -- they only pay $40 a week." But Fisher remains 
hopeful that placements can be made in Germany, France or Sweden, where a 
weaker dollar and other factors combine to make the transAtlantic plane-fare 
tab and $100 weekly stipend more affordable. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon and Michael Schneider of North Tustin aren't quite sure what they'll do 
next August when their contract calls for Tina Harboe to go home. 
</P>
<P>
Tina's main role is to look after kindergarten-age Miriam, but she acts as an 
older sister and helper to the family's two teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Tina is the third au pair for the Schneiders. The two previous ones were 
illegal Belgian girls found through an ad in a Belgian newspaper. But, says 
Michael, "Tina is by far the best." 
</P>
<P>
"She's become a member of the family. I had three daughters, but now I have 
four." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
