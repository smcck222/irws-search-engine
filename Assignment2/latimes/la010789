A MIND-BOGGLING MISMATCH: CLEVELAND CLOBBERS CANOGA PARK, 126-29 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cleveland High Coach Bob Braswell vowed this week that the Cavaliers would show 
little mercy during the Northwest Valley Conference season. Perhaps his players 
got carried away in Friday's conference opener at Canoga Park, however. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland, the state's second-ranked team in Division I, walloped the Hunters 
by the improbable score of 126-29, leading by as many as 100 points before 
settling for a 97-point victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers led, 28-2, after the first quarter, 65-7 at halftime, and showed 
little letdown after intermission. Cleveland's 40-point third quarter was its 
most productive period in school history, and the 126 points set another school 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers (11-2) averaged nearly 4 points a minute, and all 13 players in 
uniform scored. Lucious Harris scored 40 and Adonis Jordan added 37. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cleveland and Canoga Park (2-9) play in the same conference, the teams 
are grouped in different City Section divisions: Cleveland is a 4-A team and 
the Hunters are 3-A. That gulf seemed 100 miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
"They're too fast, too big and too quick," Hunter assistant Mark Nogy said. 
Head Coach Joey Nakasone refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers overwhelmed the Hunters with full-court pressure defense from the 
opening tip-off, lifting the press in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he wasn't going to take any prisoners and he stuck by his word," Nogy 
said. "It's hard to take but it's a free country." 
</P>
<P>
Braswell admitted he was embarrassed by the final score. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that's the best word to use," he said. "I teach my kids to play one 
way and you never want to stray from that. I sympathize with Joey and the kids. 
I don't want to destroy any kid's pride." 
</P>
<P>
Taft 59, San Fernando 50 -- Guard Tony Middleton scored 15 of his game-high 22 
points in the second half to lead Taft (11-1) to victory in the Northwest 
Valley Conference opener at San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Taft point guard Dedan Thomas added 17 points, including 7 of 9 free throws in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
With 5 minutes to play, San Fernando (6-7) trailed, 52-48, but could not get 
any closer. 
</P>
<P>
A trio of juniors paced San Fernando. Guard Marco Renteria scored 16 points and 
center Lance Whitaker added 13. Forward Michael Wynn scored 7 points and had a 
game-high 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham 71, Monroe 55 -- Tyrone Craig scored a game-high 19 points and Jason 
Wallace added 16 points for the Braves in the Valley Pac 8 Conference opener at 
Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon Wright led Monroe (1-7) with 14 points and Lodis Woodmore added 8 points 
and 8 rebounds. Larry Sims had 12 points for the Braves (5-6), who outscored 
Monroe, 20-8, in the final period. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda 71, Poly 59 -- Coley Kyman scored 20 of his game-high 25 points in the 
first half and the Regents' defense stifled Poly's outside shooters in a Valley 
Pac 8 Conference opener. 
</P>
<P>
Kyman also had a game-high 16 rebounds and teammate Mike Basowski added 23 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Cooper scored 17 points for Poly (5-6) and teammate Juan Estrada added 
16. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar 51, Van Nuys 49 -- Clarence Pattin scored 16 points and Andre Robinson 
added 12 points and 9 rebounds as the Spartans held off the Wolves in the 
Valley Pac 8 Conference opener at Van Nuys.

DEPTH SERVES OCCIDENTAL IN VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Occidental College Coach Brian Newhall applied the Oxy 12 Friday night rather 
than the usual Oxy 5, getting extra strength from his bench and erasing any 
doubt as to whether the Tigers would get a chance to defend the title of their 
own basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, whose only blemish on an otherwise-perfect record was a 
season-opening defeat to Christian Heritage, won their ninth in a row, 
defeating Christ College of Irvine, 106-58, in the opening round of the 
Occidental tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental will meet Grand Canyon tonight at 8 for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Canyon, the defending (NAIA) champion, is coached by Bill Westphal, the 
Occidental mentor last year. Newhall doesn't think that will give his club any 
added incentive. 
</P>
<P>
"It don't think it means anything extra," Newhall said. "We don't have anything 
to lose. Our players are fired up for it." 
</P>
<P>
Twelve Tigers got into the score book against Christ (4-9), led by 6-10 center 
Chris Anderson, who had 23 points, 7 rebounds and 5 blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
Forward John Keister, the tournament MVP a year ago, added 20 points for 
Occidental, and Stephen Bertz (13 points), Brett Dennis (11) and Jeff Muir (10) 
also scored in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
Only one Tiger failed to score, starting guard Jason Greenstein. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental, which led, 45-30, at halftime, hit 11 of its first 13 shots in the 
second half to turn the game into a rout, allowing Newhall to substitute 
freely. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Gay led Christ with 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
In the other semifinal: 
</P>
<P>
Grand Canyon 95, Southern California College 77 -- Craig Johnson, brother of 
Dennis Johnson of the Boston Celtics, scored 17 second-half points as the 
Antelopes (12-1) pulled away from the Vanguards (10-2) in the final 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, only 5-9, finished with a game-high 22 points and punctuated his total 
with 2 1-handed dunks in the final 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Blair Oliphant added 18 points for Grand Canyon, 13 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Bickmore and Todd Dixon each had 21 points for Southern California 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JIM COLEMAN 
</P>
<P>
NONCONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Montana 74, Cal Lutheran 55 -- A tenacious Yellowjacket defense held 
high-scoring Steve deLaveaga of Cal Lutheran to 12 points in the nonconference 
game at Eastern Montana College in Billings. 
</P>
<P>
Although deLaveaga hit 67% of his shots, Eastern Montana did an excellent job 
of denying him the ball, limiting him to 9 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
With Eastern Montana point guard Brian Herrell (4 points and 7 assists) holding 
deLaveaga to 4 points in the first half, the Yellowjackets took a 13-point lead 
at intermission, outscoring the Kingsmen, 25-11, to end the half. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Logsdon led Cal Lutheran (6-7), which dropped its third game in a row, 
with 15 points. Troy Truvillion and Pryor Orser each scored 16 points for 
Eastern Montana (11-2). 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge 78, East Texas State 73 -- Clutch free-throw shooting in 
the final 2 minutes by Bridgette Ealy and freshman Jill Brawner led the Lady 
Matadors to their second win in the 3-game swing through Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Arlotto scored a game-high 21 points and had 2 key steals down the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
For CSUN (11-3), Ealy added 14 points and Chris Cavalin had 10. The game was 
tied, 33-33, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo 106, Cal Lutheran 72 -- Deborah Vettel scored a team-high 18 
points and teammate Stephanie Rainwater came off the bench to tally 15 for San 
Luis Obispo in the nonconference game at San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
Forwards Brenda Lee and Heidi Griffith scored 20 and 16, but it was not enough 
to prevent the Regals (2-6) from losing their 6th consecutive game.

<P>
Scott Foster and David Harbour each scored 13 points, and Rick Schnell and 
Jason Hunt added 12 each. Foster, who also grabbed 13 rebounds, had the added 
responsibility of guarding Kurt Schwan, Westlake's 6-8 center. Foster limited 
Schwan, who had been averaging more than 20 points a game, to 11. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo (10-3) has won 4 consecutive games and 7 of its last 8. The Scorpions

led Crespi with 15 points and 12 rebounds.

FAST BREAK HELPS HART TO VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hart High Coach Pam Walker starts 4 players who stand 6-foot or taller, so it 
could easily be assumed that most of the Indians' points are notched in the 
paint. However, their offensive strategy in a Foothill League opener Friday at 
Alhambra was different. 
</P>
<P>
Hart (12-2 overall) scored most of its points on fast breaks and thrashed the 
Moors, 78-36, at Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
Sara Wilson, a 6-3 preseason All-American, scored 20 points and grabbed 16 
rebounds. Teammate Nikki Bodowy also had 20 points and pulled down 10 rebounds. 
Freshman Anjanette Dionne had 14 points and 5 steals.

In another Southern Section game: 
</P>

EX-OCEANSIDE TEACHER GUILTY OF MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Oceanside High School history teacher was found guilty Friday of six counts 
of statutory rape and child molestation by a Vista Superior Court jury. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Palos de la Rosa, 32, who is on unpaid leave from the school district, 
will be sentenced March 3. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated nearly two days before reaching its verdict about 3:30 
p.m. Friday, finding Palos de la Rosa guilty on all counts in a continuing 
affair with a 16-year-old girl, now 17 and transferred to another high school. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Caryn Rosen said after the verdict was returned that she was 
"pleased and happy for the victim" and hoped that the teen-ager "can put this 
behind her and get on with her life now." 
</P>
<P>
Palos de la Rosa admitted having a friendship with the girl but denied a sexual 
liaison with her. He said he considered her a student, a friend and a member of 
the family. 
</P>
<P>
But Rosen, in opening statements in the trial, contended that Palos de la Rosa 
had "acted upon a crush" the teen-ager had confessed. Rosen said the teacher 
had "stepped over the bounds and had sexual relations with a student and a 
minor." 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside Police Officer Scott Gillis, brother-in-law of Palos de la Rosa, 
testified during the trial that Palos de la Rosa had admitted to his family 
that he had had sexual relations with the teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Richard Muir said he could not speak for his client about 
whether the verdict would be appealed or not, but said "there are significant 
issues in the case that need to be looked into." 
</P>
<P>
"In light of the totality of the evidence," Muir said, "the jury's verdict 
seems not unreasonable." 
</P>
<P>
Muir, in defending Palos de la Rosa, argued that the teen-ager had developed a 
crush on her teacher and had imagined the sexual consummation. Palos de la Rosa 
testified that he had maintained a close friendship with the girl but denied 
any sexual wrongdoing.

PESKY FLU BUG RETURNS IN ANNUAL VISIT; NO EVIDENCE OF EPIDEMIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN FAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's that time of year again. Influenza, a contagious disease characterized by 
fever, muscle pain and an inflamed respiratory tract, is making its rounds in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In the past 30 days, five reported cases of influenza were confirmed by 
laboratory analysis, county health officials said. But, because most doctors 
don't confirm influenza by sending samples to a lab, "That's only the tip of 
the iceberg. . . . If there are five, there are literally dozens, maybe 
hundreds, more," said health official Dr. Donald Ramras. 
</P>
<P>
However, health officials say there is no epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
School Absenteeism 
</P>
<P>
School absenteeism rates -- used by the County Health Services Department to 
determine whether there is an influenza outbreak -- are not yet available 
because students have only just returned to classes after the holidays. 
Absenteeism rates before Christmas were "normal," Ramras said. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Beck, school nurse supervisor for the San Diego Unified School District, 
said she had no indication of large numbers of students catching influenza. 
</P>
<P>
District figures show 96,659 absences because of illness or other personal 
reasons from Nov. 7 to Dec. 2, contrasted with 89,549 absences from Oct. 10 to 
Nov. 4. These figures do not include absences because of truancy. 
</P>
<P>
The two other indexes the county uses to determine epidemics, the number of 
laboratory tests and emergency room admissions, do not indicate an epidemic 
either, Ramras said. 
</P>
<P>
"Influenza is not a reportable disease; there's no way of getting a firm feel 
of what's going on . . . there's no question we have some," he said. "The 
extent is just hard to put a finger on." The disease, he said, is "very common 
for this time of the year. We're probably going to continue to have it for the 
next couple months." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slight Increase 
</P>
<P>
Laura Avallone, a spokeswoman for Mercy Hospital, said the emergency room had 
seen a "slight increase" in people coming in with colds and influenza. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for UC San Diego Medical Center's Family Practice said more 
people have been coming in with viruses, coughs and sore throats and more have 
been requesting flu vaccinations. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Berger at Palomar Hospital's emergency room said he has not seen 
anything indicating an outbreak of influenza, but he said more people are 
likely to catch it at this time of year. "The cold weather doesn't bring it on, 
but people are indoors more and the infectivity is enhanced," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ramras said influenza can kill people in "high risk" groups -- in particular 
older people with chronic heart or metabolic problems and kidney and lung 
complications. 
</P>
<P>
The best protection from the disease is immunization, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Other than that, just keep generally in good health," Ramras said. "There's no 
way to prevent exposure unless you live in a closed box. . . . It's just plain 
old common sense, not abusing your body."

BURIED TREASURE

<TEXT>

Jaime Escalante became famous teaching advanced mathematics to poor students at 
Garfield High School in East Los Angeles. A book was written about him, 
President-elect George Bush mentioned him during his campaign, and he was even 
the subject of a movie. But, with typical modesty, Escalante points out that 
his success in the classroom would not have been possible without support from 
a principal who believed in the potential of his students. 
</P>
<P>
That is why it was big news -- not just in Los Angeles but across the nation as 
well -- when the man who ran Garfield High when Escalante launched his dramatic 
teaching experiment, Henry Gradillas, was shunted into an obscure 
administrative job deep within the bureaucracy of the Los Angeles Unified 
School District. Gradillas left Garfield in 1987 to finish his work toward a 
doctoral degree. But when he returned to the district last August, he was put 
to work overseeing school asbestos inspections. To outsiders it looked as if he 
were being underutilized at best and being sent into academic exile at worst. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles school officials are understandably defensive about the negative 
publicity that Gradillas' new job generated. They say that it was temporary 
until a more suitable administrative position for Gradillas became available. 
But, in the meantime, State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig offered 
Gradillas a job at the state level, and he agreed to take it. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to maintain Gradillas' ties to Los Angeles, local officials are 
now negotiating with Honig to share him with the state education department on 
a temporary basis. That is an acceptable solution for now. But principals like 
Gradillas are every bit as important as teachers like Escalante, so the sooner 
Gradillas is back in Los Angeles, doing what he does best, the better off the 
city's schools will be.

TANGLED NORTH CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A criminal trial is supposed to be a search for the truth, an opportunity for 
12 jurors -- surrogates for the rest of the citizenry -- to weigh the evidence 
against the accused and decide whether to believe him or his accusers. 
Unfortunately, in the case of the United States of America vs. Oliver L. North, 
the process of getting at the truth has been thwarted forever by the 
independent counsel's decision to drop the two major charges against him. 
Although North still stands accused of a dozen lesser crimes that could land 
him in jail for up to 60 years, much of the evidence that has been compiled 
about his reckless campaign to fund the Nicaraguan Contras with the profits 
from the sale of U.S. arms to Iran will never be aired. And that can only 
frustrate everyone who genuinely cares about the truth. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, conspiracies will be seen in independent counsel Lawrence E. 
Walsh's motion to dismiss the charges of conspiracy and theft of government 
property because, he said, they could not be tried without compromising 
national security. Dropping those counts amounts to "a pocket pardon," an 
attempt to do indirectly what President Reagan could not do directly, charged 
the People for the American Way. Because Walsh's motion came within days of 
North's move to subpoena Reagan and President-elect George Bush as defense 
witnesses, there is speculation that they blocked the disclosure of classified 
documents to avoid long days on the witness stand or a protracted fight over 
executive privilege or both. And some critics have accused the intelligence 
agencies of thwarting the investigation to cover up telephone intercepts, 
bribes and other operations that they might have trouble justifying. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, however intriguing the conspiracy theories, there is scant evidence to 
support any of them. The initial refusal to release classified documents on the 
terms established by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell came not from the 
White House but from an interagency group of intelligence experts, some of whom 
have been openly critical of North. Gesell had ruled that those documents could 
be partly sanitized to protect some intelligence sources and covert operations, 
but he was adamant that, for North to receive a fair trial, the government 
should identify the countries with which he dealt and specify the ranks and 
responsibilities of foreign officials mentioned in the documents. And the 
interagency panel was just as adamant that such matters could not be made 
public without jeopardizing U.S. interests abroad. Independent counsel Walsh, 
very much the man in the middle of this tug-of-war between the Administration 
and Judge Gesell, struggled for months to find a compromise. An upright former 
judge and president of the American Bar Assn., Walsh very much wanted to try 
North on all the charges but finally conceded defeat. The motion that he filed 
to dismiss the two major counts was tinged with regret. 
</P>
<P>
Should Gesell have given in to the demands of the interagency group and fully 
censored the documents? Were the intelligence experts overly protective and too 
quick to see potential harm to the national interest in the documents sought by 
the prosecution and the defense? Has the Reagan Administration twisted the 
Classified Information Procedures Act to protect North, one of its own? Or was 
the government tied up in knots by North's ingenious defense lawyer, Brendan V. 
Sullivan Jr., who knew that basing a defense on top-secret documents was the 
surest way to torpedo the prosecution? 
</P>
<P>
It is easier to pose those questions than to answer them. Because the cloak of 
national security envelops this case, the public may never get satisfactory 
answers. And, while North will stand trial on felony charges of obstructing 
justice, destroying evidence and lying to Congress, Americans will be denied 
the full story of his involvement in the Iran-Contra episode. His guilt or 
innocence, like that of former President Richard M. Nixon in the Watergate 
scandal, will be one of those matters debated for years to come, without any 
real resolution. Being denied the truth is frustrating, but that is the price 
to be paid for a system of justice that mandates due process for all criminal 
defendants, even the most notorious.

THE LONGEST REIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the death of Emperor Hirohito the longest reign in Japan's history has 
come to an end, and the final lines have been written to one of the 20th 
Century's most momentous chapters. Hirohito was the last survivor among the 
national leaders of World War II. He was also the last of Japan's emperors -- 
the 124th that tradition traces in an unbroken line to 660 BC -- to be revered 
by his subjects as a god, "sacred and inviolable." On Jan. 1, 1946, just a few 
months after Japan's wartime defeat and the beginning of the American military 
occupation, Hirohito announced to his shocked subjects that -- contrary to all 
they had always been taught -- he was not divine. With that disavowal centuries 
of myth and legend were eradicated, and authority in Japan was redefined. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 62 years the United States has had 11 Presidents, but Japan has had 
only one emperor. In the course of Hirohito's reign Japan evolved to claim a 
primary role as a world power; launched a war of aggression that ranged from 
China to Australia and from India to Alaska and that claimed millions of lives; 
suffered a crushing military defeat, urban devastation and the deaths of 1.5 
million of its own people, and then began the process that would see it reborn 
as a democracy and as one of the world's economic titans. 
</P>
<P>
Scholars have long debated Hirohito's role in Japan's military adventurism. If 
any documents that might provide definitive answers exist, they are locked in 
the imperial archives, secure from public scrutiny. Available evidence does 
seem to suggest that Hirohito, whatever his personal inclinations, kept himself 
largely aloof from the political decisions and planning that led to 
militaristic expansionism and war. As historian Robert J. C. Butow wrote: "For 
the emperor successfully to have intervened in such a way as to direct affairs 
along lines more in accord with his personal conscience would have required him 
to be a man of less retiring personality, with a very practical grasp of 
political affairs." A bolder and more worldly man, sensing the enormity of the 
challenge that Japan was undertaking, might have tried to curb the militarists 
who dominated the government in the 1930s. But the emperor was what he was. 
Raised from birth in full awareness of his unique status, he was also deeply 
conscious of the restraints that attached to it. 
</P>
<P>
Hirohito's reign was known as Showa, or Enlightened Peace, and it was by this 
name that he was known to his countrymen. For the better part of his reign 
Japan did experience peace. The emperor on his part adapted easily to his 
postwar renunciation of divinity, carried out his ceremonial functions with 
grace, took pleasure in the company of his family and pursued his beloved 
avocation as a marine biologist. Once he inspired awe and reverence in his 
countrymen. Later he was content to have their esteem and affection. Most 
Japanese were prepared to give that willingly. The emperor's final illness, 
which saw his life being extended only by the most invasive medical 
intervention, was a difficult period for Japan. That period is now over, and 
with it ends an era. Now begins a new chapter in Japan's long imperial history.

SETTING THE STAGE FOR PEACE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Al-Marayati and Ibrahim chastise Israel for the settlements on the West Bank as 
an obstacle to peace. From 1948 to 1967, the West Bank was in Arab hands; there 
were no Jewish settlements. That time was characterized by continual terrorist 
attacks on Israeli citizens, buses, schoolchildren, markets and kibbutzim. 
</P>
<P>
As for speaking with the PLO, it is no surprise that Israel chooses not to sit 
down with a sworn enemy actively engaged in a sustained assault against it, 
denying its right to exist, disavowing any negotiations and any peace. Let the 
PLO demonstrate any good intentions of its words with actions; or, better yet, 
let the Palestinian people elect representatives who do not hold office by 
force, and let them offer Israel an opportunity to come to the negotiation 
table without preconditions. 
</P>
<P>
Every Israeli prime minister from David Ben Gurion to Yitzhak Shamir have 
extended hopeful invitations, even please, to its Arab neighbors for direct 
negotiations without preconditions. The Arab response has been consistent: no 
recognition, no negotiation, no peace. This is, and has been, the essential 
barrier to peace in the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
Israel is prepared to go the extra mile for peace. It is not willing to go to 
national suicide.

CLOSING U.S. MILITARY BASES

<P>
We see in The Times that Uncle Sam is planning to close a few U.S. military 
bases to save a few million dollars each year. Why don't we close a few of our 
bases in foreign lands and save a few billion dollars? 
</P>
<P>
Who are we protecting these people from? Why are U.S. citizens paying the tab 
to "protect" other countries' citizens from whomever it is they need protecting 
from? Has anybody ever told us how many trillion dollars we have spent to 
provide this service? 
</P>
<P>
Let's ask Uncle "Sucker" to charge all "protected" nations for services 
rendered. If we are in the business of protecting all the free nations of the 
world, then let's make the business "capitalistic" and debit them or credit 
their debts to us for the cost of military bases in their countries at cost 
plus.

BAN AGAINST AMERICAN BEEF IN EUROPE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
European countries care enough about good health to ban hormone-treated beef. 
No one knows how rising U.S. rates for cancer and other illnesses are affected 
by a lifetime diet of beef and chicken treated with hormones and antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, small businesses specializing in imports must now close up shop, 
thanks to new U.S. tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
Why build up all this ill will? 
</P>
<P>
Our government should immediately ban hormones and antibiotics added to meats 
-- a gesture of good will to our own people and to Europe.

Thank you for publishing the article by Salam Al-Marayati and R. Ibrahim, "To 
Set the Stage for Peace, Israel Must Agree to Steps U.S. Asked of Palestinians" 
(Op-Ed Page, Dec. 28). 
</P>
<P>
I, as a common, concerned American, fully endorse and support their viewpoint. 
The article is timely, accurate, relevant and fair. The Israeli government must 
be persuaded to overcome its intransigence and accept the reality of Palestine 
so that Christians, Muslims, Jewish and other minorities can be spared further 
pain, anguish, torment and the sanctity of human life can be restored. 
</P>
<P>
We Americans have always been champions of human rights and it's our moral, 
ethical and political duty to help homeless Palestinians have their own 
homeland and save Israel from its self-destructive course.

BAN AGAINST AMERICAN BEEF IN EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent announcement of agricultural trade sanctions by the United States 
against the European Community (Part I, Dec. 28) is bad for U.S. consumers and 
bad for international relations. 
</P>
<P>
European consumer groups have persuaded their representatives to outlaw beef 
contaminated with hormones. Most U.S.-produced beef and poultry is raised using 
hormones and antibiotics. Instead of retaliating against the European Community 
for protecting the health of its citizens, we should be educating our own 
citizens about what goes into the meat they eat, and encouraging our own 
farmers to produce meat without hormones and antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
The Europeans have created a huge market for hormone-free beef. Our farmers are 
just as capable as European farmers of producing such beef; doing so would make 
it easier for health-conscious Americans to find clean meat in our own stores. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration claims that this European ban on hormone-contaminated beef 
has nothing to do with health, but is merely a means for protecting their 
"inefficient" small farmers. What does the Administration think is "efficient"? 
We have seen our own small farmers put out of business by huge agribusiness 
enterprises. The "efficiency" of these enterprises results from exploiting the 
stored fertility of the land with chemical fertilizers, pesticides and 
herbicides, and from a subsidy system that helps big agribusiness more than it 
does the small family farmer. 
</P>
<P>
But the rapacious practices of chemical, highly mechanized farming are not 
sustainable. In 1985 it took nearly three times as much oil to produce a ton of 
grain as in 1950. In 1982 American farmers lost 6 tons of topsoil for every ton 
of grain produced. There are many sustainable agriculture practices, now being 
used and researched by organic farmers that enrich the soil and require far 
less energy. Instead of exhorting European farmers to chemical-dependent 
"efficiency," we should be encouraging our own farmers to convert to 
sustainable agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
As consumers we can act over the heads of our backward government. We urge 
everyone who buys food to demand hormone- and antibiotic-free meat, and organic 
fruits and vegetables. Better yet, join or organize a food cooperative and gain 
some control over the quality of the food you and your family eat.

STATION HIRES REPORTER FACING NEGLECT CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A news reporter charged with neglecting her bedridden 77-year-old mother, who 
authorities said died last month of malnutrition, has been rehired by the radio 
station where she had worked. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Jeter Green, 38, of North Hollywood will work part-time as a newscaster 
at KMNY, a 24-hour financial news station where she had worked last year. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Sheehan, a KMNY spokesman, said he was not certain when Green would begin 
work. An employee said a posted work schedule indicated that it will be this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Sheehan called Green a "good researcher, a good reporter, good on-air person 
and all-around professional." 
</P>
<P>
Green has worked for several Los Angeles radio stations since moving from Texas 
four years ago. She lost her job at KMNY, where she worked about six months in 
1988, after missing several days of work to care for her mother, who had 
Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
Sheehan said station officials rehired her partly because they felt compassion 
for her. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize she had a tremendous amount of responsibility in caring for her 
mother," Sheehan said. "It must have been a stressful and heart-wrenching 
situation for her to be in." 
</P>
<P>
Green's mother, Virginia Jeter, died Dec. 26 at Kaiser Permanente Medical 
Center in Panorama City several hours after paramedics were summoned to their 
house on Bellingham Avenue in North Hollywood. Green told paramedics that she 
feared her mother had suffered a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics said they found Jeter lying in a filthy hospital bed. She weighed 
only 70 pounds and was suffering from malnutrition, skin rot and bedsores. She 
did not respond to attempts to revive her, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Green is charged with one felony count of endangering an elderly person through 
neglect, which carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison. Authorities 
have not decided whether to file a more serious charge that improper care 
contributed to her death, Deputy Dist. Atty. Lee Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Green's attorney, Marc A. Hentell, has said his client is undergoing 
psychiatric evaluation on his orders. 
</P>
<P>
"I think working without the constant worry of the care of her mother is the 
best therapy that she could have," Hentell said. "But it's still a traumatic 
experience, not only the death of her mother but that coupled with the criminal 
charges." 
</P>
<P>
He called Green's rehiring "quite an endorsement from her colleagues."

<P>
A San Ysidro man was arrested Friday and charged with buying more than $300,000 
worth of merchandise with fraudulent cashier's checks during the last two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Dominguez Acosta, believed to be about 20 years old, was arrested in his 
apartment on West San Ysidro Boulevard by San Diego County Sheriff's Department 
detectives. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta was booked into the downtown jail on an unspecified number of charges in 
connection with the purchases, which had been made since Dec. 23, Lt. Bob 
Trevino said. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino said Acosta bought a Jet-Ski, jewelry, electronics and other 
merchandise. The bogus checks were passed at a Honda-Kawasaki dealer in Lemon 
Grove, a Radio Shack in Vista and unidentified merchants in Chula Vista, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista Police Sgt. Art Hauer said that his department has no idea how many 
of the fake checks may still be floating around. "The checks are 'in the mail,' 
so to speak, to be sent back to the victims," he said. Authorities have three 
of them so far. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants can lessen the chance of being victimized, Hauer said, if they ask 
for some sort of identification and call the issuing bank for verification. 
</P>
<P>
"One victim was under the impression that a cashier's check is as 'good as 
gold,' " Hauer said. "That may have been true in the past. Now, there's a lot 
of technology and duplicating equipment, and you can't say that anymore. The 
fictitious (checks) look so authentic that the best thing to do is to verify 
them with the issuing bank." 
</P>
<P>
The issuing bank cited on the fraudulent checks was Mission Valley Bank of San 
Clemente.

OWNERS OF EMPTIED LAKE WIN RIGHT TO SUE STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Friday that a damage suit against 
the state by Ventura County property owners whose lake was emptied can go to 
trial in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
After heavy rain in 1983, two slides occurred on the face of Sinaloa Dam. 
Officials of the nearby city of Simi Valley evacuated about 1,400 residents 
living below it and pumped some water out of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, when the water level was down 11 feet, the city decided that 
the emergency was over, and residents returned to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
However, a week later, the California Department of Water Resources siphoned 
off the water because it said the dam was unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
The action was taken the same afternoon that a Superior Court judge, after a 
hasty informal meeting with lawyers in chambers, declined to issue a 
restraining order sought by the owners. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the water in Sinaloa Lake was removed, and the Sinaloa Lake 
Owners Assn. sued for damages, saying property values had declined. 
</P>
<P>
A 1986 decision of U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie of Los Angeles barring 
the dispute from going to trial was reversed by the appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
The 9th Circuit rejected several arguments from the plaintiffs but concluded 
that the case could go to trial on a claim that the plaintiffs had been 
unconstitutionally denied due process of law. They said the state should have 
given them adequate notice and should have conducted a hearing before taking 
action. 
</P>
<P>
The property owners did not file suit in state courts, choosing instead to 
bring their action in federal courts.

MONDAY SOUNDS GOOD TO PADRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Padres' winter of introductions continued Friday evening when the team 
announced that former major league outfielder Rick Monday will fill the 
broadcasting vacancy created by last fall's dismissal of Dave Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, a 43-year-old former major league outfielder, joins Jerry Coleman, Ted 
Leitner and Bob Chandler on Padre broadcasts. Monday will team with Coleman for 
all 51 road television broadcasts, and the two will work together on all other 
games on radio. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to being part of an organization that's been growing by 
leaps and bounds," Monday said at a reception that served as the premiere of 
the Padres' 1988 highlight film ("Changes in Attitudes"). "I was on a Caribbean 
cruise 3 weeks ago with three Dodger players and a coach, and I can tell you, 
there's a ballclub about 100 miles to the north that's extremely nervous over 
all of the Padre acquisitions." 
</P>
<P>
Monday signed a 2-year contract. No terms were announced, but the salary for 
the Padres' No. 2 man is believed to be in the neighborhood of $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
Monday has been a part of the Los Angeles Dodger cable broadcasting team and 
until recently was sports anchor for KTTV (Ch. 11) in Los Angeles. He worked 
the College World Series championship game with Brent Musburger in June for 
CBS-TV. 
</P>
<P>
Another man who regularly works with Musburger, on the CBS radio game of the 
week, thinks Monday's presence is a positive step for the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of anybody on earth who I'm more delighted to see than Rick 
Monday," Coleman said. "He's a quality person, he knows baseball, and I can 
chew the fat with him because he's a former player." 
</P>
<P>
Monday sent a tape and resume to Jim Winters, the Padre director of 
broadcasting, a couple of months ago, but he and the Padres began talking 
seriously Wednesday when Monday flew to San Diego to meet with Winters and Dick 
Freeman, the Padres' acting president. By late Friday morning -- nearly 2 weeks 
after Winters' original Christmas goal -- an agreement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
Winters then mentioned that the club was holding its annual party Friday night 
to premiere the highlight film and wondered if Monday could make it down from 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"As we were landing in San Diego, my wife (Karen) looked at me and said, 'Do 
you kind of get the feeling that you've gotten traded to a club where you 
wanted to go?' " Monday said. "And I said, 'Yes, but at least this time I'm 
involved.' " 
</P>
<P>
Monday, who will begin looking for a home in San Diego next week, summarized 
his broadcasting style: "Be honest in what I see and care for what I do. 
Basically, without being trite, that's about it. There are a lot of things 
involved in broadcasting. Am I a homer? No, but I care about the organization, 
and I'm a part of it. I'm not a sensationalist." 
</P>
<P>
He said would like to accomplish two things in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been fortunate enough to be with a championship club as a player, now I'd 
like nothing better than to be with one as a broadcaster," he said. "And I'm 
looking forward to getting another haircut. The last one I got here was real 
close." 
</P>
<P>
Monday spent some time here with the U.S. Marine Corp Reserves in the early 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Winters had originally hoped to fill the vacancy with a potential replacement 
for Coleman, whose 3-year contract expires at the end of the 1991 season. But 
as the process became more and more involved, he soon was forced to change 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
It was thought several weeks ago that Gary Thorne was the leading candidate for 
the vacancy, but he was hired as part of the Chicago White Sox television 
broadcast team. Gary Cohen was also a candidate, but he joined the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
The third choice was Chicago Cubs broadcaster Dewayne Staats, but he and the 
Padres could not reach an agreement. Winters said he then realized the Padres 
might be better off hiring a No. 2 man and worrying about replacing Coleman 
when the time comes. 
</P>
<P>
"After talking with the Dewayne Staatses and Gary Thornes of the world, we 
found out that most of them wanted to step into the No. 1 slot right now," 
Winters said. "I don't blame them for that, but it became apparent to us that 
to find a quality person, like a Rick Monday, maybe we should fill the No. 2 
position." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all that, Winters said Monday was under consideration throughout the 
process. "His name was there. It just took a little while longer to get it 
done," Winters said. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes: 
</P>
<P>
The Padres and pitcher Greg Booker have agreed to a 1-year contract. . . . 
According to Dick Freeman, the Padres' acting president, season ticket sales 
are about 30% ahead of last year's pace. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

BEATING SOCKERS LETS BLAST 'SPLIT' 
</P>

<P>
The Baltimore Blast, which began Friday with an 11-4 record, finished Friday 
with an 11-4 record thanks to a 4-2 victory over the Sockers at the Sports 
Arena Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Kai Haaskivi, who when left alone can pick apart a defense with the precision 
of a red-hot quarterback, found a couple of openings to his liking and had a 
goal and an assist to save the Blast from a rare Major Indoor Soccer League 
double -- losing a victory and a game on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers lost their second consecutive game, this one in front of 7,671 
fans, because they were shackled by a team that earlier Friday was fit to be 
tied. 
</P>
<P>
The MISL took away -- for the moment at least -- the Blast's 8-6 victory over 
Kansas City Dec. 27 when it upheld the Comets' protest of a third-quarter goal 
the Blast scored to take a 5-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Two Kansas City players were in the penalty box when the goal was scored, which 
wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that their penalties had been 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
MISL Commissioner Bill Kentling said the game will restart April 2 with 5:33 
remaining in the third quarter and Baltimore leading, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Said Baltimore Coach Kenny Cooper: "We still feel we are 12-4 now. Their two 
players were talking when their penalty ended. They should have known to come 
out of the box." 
</P>
<P>
There will be no such ruling to save the Sockers from Friday's loss. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore, still in first place, suppressed the Sockers' offense all evening 
and moved four games ahead of them in the MISL standings. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers (8-9) have made great strides since starting the season 3-7, but it 
looks as if they still have a ways to go. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between our team and their team right now is that they have 
five players back there defending like crazy," Socker Coach Ron Newman said. 
"We'd have five back there sometimes, but other times we'd have only 2 or 3." 
</P>
<P>
That must explain the openings the Sockers allowed Haaskivi, who was given 
extra time to plan on both the goal and the assist. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not a guy you want to let go," Newman said. "We know that he can be very 
methodical with his finishing if he gets clear." 
</P>
<P>
Haaskivi had time to think back to some of the pain the Sockers inflicted on 
his Cleveland Force in a four-game sweep of the MISL Championship Series this 
past June. 
</P>
<P>
With his new team, Haaskivi got a little payback Friday. 
</P>
<P>
With the Blast leading, 1-0, late in the second quarter, Haaskivi was allowed 
to survey the field from the right of the Sockers' goal. 
</P>
<P>
Like a wide receiver running a fly pattern, Carl Valentine beat the Sockers' 
Alan Willey by a step. Haaskivi's pass was perfect, and Valentine his second 
goal too give Baltimore a 2-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Valentine, who also played for Cleveland last year, had scored early in the 
second quarter on a pass from Desmond Armstrong, another ex-Force player now in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us remember," Haaskivi said. "We think we have a team here that can get 
back to the finals, and maybe this time, can take that extra step." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers, after crawling through the first half, came to life momentarily 15 
seconds into the third quarter when Kevin Crow scored on a breakaway. 
</P>
<P>
The momentum was slowed a few minutes later by Haaskivi. 
</P>
<P>
Left alone at the left side this time, Haaskivi beat Socker goalkeeper Victor 
Nogueira with a low shot that banked in off the far post. 
</P>
<P>
With 26 seconds left in the third quarter, Freddie Thompson scored to give the 
Blast a 4-1 lead and put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Said MISL Commissioner Bill Kentling on why he decided to uphold the Comets' 
protest in the Dec. 27 game against Baltimore: "League rules were misapplied 
and a technical error was made in not properly releasing the two Kansas City 
players from the penalty box. The unfair advantage dramatically altered the 
game resulting in a completely different contest from that point on." . . . 
Paul Dougherty, who had played in a Socker-record 91 consecutive games, did not 
play Friday because of a bruised foot. . . . The Sockers sixth championship 
rings will be presented in a ceremony before Sunday's 6:05 game against the Los 
Angeles Lazers. It's appropriate the Sockers are staging their ring ceremony 
before a game with Los Angeles since three players (Waad Hirmez, Jim Gorsek and 
Fernando Clavijo) who helped the Sockers win the 1987-88 championship now play 
for the Lazers.

FANS OF PREP SPORTS AREN'T GETTING ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I think a disservice has been done to high school sports followers. The dip in 
The Times' high school coverage began just a few years back, with the 
elimination of league track and field scores. But this, the elimination of 
consolation and other loser games in preseason high school basketball 
tournaments is really a blow. 
</P>
<P>
Those of us who follow high school sports religiously, and it is a mighty army, 
want to follow not only our own teams, but those of nearby rivals. Of course, 
most of these, by odds, do not make tournament finals. Therefore, we don't know 
how those teams did and can't play that great game of "comparative scores" 
before the opening of the league season.

REAL FOOTBALL IS PLAYED AT BOWLING GREEN, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps West Virginia Coach Don Nehlen should learn a little history before he 
opens his mouth again in front of 200 reporters. In the Bowl Notebook on Dec. 
30, Nehlen said he "thanked goodness (he) had a chance to go where they play 
real football," while commenting on his departure from Bowling Green State 
University. 
</P>

Just to refresh Nehlen's memory, Bowling Green earned a bowl bid and a national 
ranking with a 10-0 record 3 years before the Mountaineers did it for the first 
time in their 97-year history.

ABDUL-JABBAR NOT TOO OLD TO PROVIDE INSPIRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By suggesting early retirement for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar just because, at 41, 
he's not playing as he did 10 or 20 years ago, Scott Ostler (Dec. 29) ignores 
the Laker center's real value to this team -- experience and inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
Every year about this time, someone writes this team and Kareem off, and every 
year they're right back in the thick of the championship race. 
</P>
<P>
I think Ostler should offer to retire if the Lakers go all the way again. That 
will really give them some motivation.

During the Michigan game, I heard comments about USC still hurting from the

CHARGERS SAY THEY'D BID TO RETAIN LYNN 
</P>

<P>
The Chargers will not lose defensive coordinator Ron Lynn to the Raiders 
without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
That was the word Friday from Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers' director of 
football operations. Ortmayer returned late Thursday from Hawaii, where he was 
scouting players at the Hula Bowl. He met with Lynn and other Charger assistant 
coaches Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we would hate to lose Ron Lynn to the Raiders," Ortmayer said. "And I 
believe he won't get away without our knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer said he has an understanding with Lynn that Lynn won't accept a 
position with the Raiders without giving Ortmayer a chance to counter. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn had preliminary talks with Raider Coach Mike Shanahan this week about the 
Raider defensive coordinator job, which became vacant recently when Charlie 
Sumner was fired. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn also is a strong candidate for the Chargers' head coaching job, which 
opened up when owner Alex Spanos fired Al Saunders Dec. 19. But Ortmayer said 
he hasn't formally interviewed Lynn yet. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer reiterated that he won't interview George Seifert, the San Francisco 
defensive coordinator, until the 49er season ends. The 49ers play the Bears 
Sunday in Chicago for the NFC championship. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer also said he has asked permission to talk to two other candidates but 
declined to name them. He said his interviewing might start as early as this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
And, he added, "the timetable for hiring a head coach may move forward (speed 
up) as our appetite gets whetted." 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer also said he is conscious of competition in the job-search market now 
that Kansas City has released its coach, Frank Gansz. "That begins to concern 
you, yes," Ortmayer said. 
</P>
<P>
But the prospect of losing popular and talented Lynn to the arch-rival Raiders 
concerns Ortmayer, a former Raider assistant, much more. The Chargers are still 
smarting from the summer trade (and the subsequent negative public fallout) 
that sent Pro Bowl offensive lineman Jim Lachey to the Raiders in exchange for 
tackle John Clay and running back Napoleon McCallum. 
</P>
<P>
Clay missed most of training camp with a back injury and most of the regular 
season with a neck injury. McCallum is in the Navy and might not be available 
until 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer stopped short of saying the Chargers will retain Lynn at all costs. 
Such a statement could tie his hands in any negotiations with Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer wouldn't say how short his list of potential candidates has become. 
But three -- UCLA Coach Terry Donahue, former Steeler assistant Tony Dungy and 
Redskin assistant Joe Bugel -- are believed to have become longshots where they 
once were being more seriously considered. 
</P>
<P>
Former Cleveland Coach Marty Schottenheimer is still very much in the picture 
as a potential hire for the Saunders' vacancy.

PEOPLE: BANK BOARD'S MCKENNA WON'T GET NEW TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco has not been 
reappointed to the top job overseeing 221 thrifts in California, Arizona and 
Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
William McKenna, 74, said Thursday that he had wanted to serve as chairman for 
another year, but he understood the decision not to reappoint him. For several 
years McKenna has criticized how Washington officials have handled the 
nationwide savings and loan crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been putting whatever obstacles I could in front of the bank board on 
several issues, and he has the right to someone who supports his policies," 
McKenna said of Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall, who made 
the decision not to reappoint him. 
</P>
<P>
Wall was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
While chairman of the San Francisco bank since 1982, McKenna, a Los Angeles 
lawyer, had disagreed with the Washington-based board on several issues. Last 
week he called for the liquidation of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance 
Corp., which insures S&amp;L deposits up to $100,000 and is governed by the 
bank board. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna is opposed to the FSLIC practice of using notes or guarantees instead 
of cash to bail out insolvent thrifts. He also is reportedly concerned with the 
year-end rush to bail out dozens of insolvent thrifts without Congressional 
approval, which could lead to a drain on taxpayers for years. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna will remain a director of the San Francisco bank during the remainder 
of his four-year term.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: INTEREST FROM SAVINGS TAXABLE EVEN FOR RETIREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Carla Lazzareschi 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I hate my job and would like to quit next summer when I reach 61 and 
still have my sanity. I want to live off the interest from my savings until I 
reach age 63 and then take Social Security and my company retirement. I expect 
the cash flow from the interest on my savings would give me about $16,000 a 
year to live on. If this interest is my only income, will I still owe federal 
and state taxes? -- P. T. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Your actual tax obligation will depend on a variety of factors, but you 
will be required to file a tax return declaring the $16,000 or so in interest 
as your annual income. Interest income is not exempt from taxation. Basically, 
a single person under age 65 with an annual income of $4,950 or more must file 
a tax return. However, your final tax bill will be based on your adjusted gross 
income, a figure that is calculated by subtracting your allowable deductions 
from your total annual income. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am a permanent resident of the United States. I am about to receive an 
old-age pension from England, and it will be deposited for me in a bank in 
England. Do I have to report this income on my income tax form in the United 
States? Also, do I have to declare interest and dividend income I receive on my 
bank accounts in England on my U.S. tax form? -- R. C. 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, you probably do. Our tax advisers say the general rule for permanent 
U.S. residents is that all income is taxable in the United States, regardless 
of its source. Nevertheless, if your pension is taxed in England, it is 
possible that your tax obligation in the United States will be forgiven. 
Whether or not taxes paid on foreign earned income to another country can be 
forgiven in the United States depends on the exact tax treaty our country has 
with the foreign country. If your pension and bank account has not been taxed 
in England, our tax advisers say it is extremely unlikely that you can avoid 
taxes on it in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are there any rules and regulations governing the length of time an employer 
has to return an employee's 401(k) contributions after the employee leaves the 
company? Also, what about profit-sharing plans -- how long can the company hold 
up distributing an employee's share after he leaves? -- G. M. B. 
</P>
<P>
A: The only firm rule governing the distribution of these funds is that the 
first payout must be made in the year the employee turns age 70 1/2. But for 
this one exception, there are no rules and regulations governing all pension 
and profit-sharing plans. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, every pension and profit-sharing plan has its own set of rules 
spelling out how the funds are administered. Ask your company's human resources 
or personnel department for a copy of the rules for your plan. 
</P>
<P>
Many plans require distribution of an employees's share of the fund at the end 
of the year in which the employee leaves the company. Other plans set the 
payout date at the end of the operating year of the pension or profit-sharing 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
In rare instances, the payout date does not occur until the employee reaches 
age 65. However, in general, our consultants say that it is not uncommon for an 
employee to wait for a full year for complete distribution of pension and 
profit-sharing funds. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I work part time at a department store and participate in the company's 
profit-sharing plan. Last year my total earnings were $12,000. Am I still 
eligible to put $2,000 into an individual retirement account for 1988? -- M. C. 
B. 
</P>
<P>
A: Now that we've officially entered the new tax season, it's time to review -- 
once more -- the rules governing IRAs. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the law allows a single worker whose adjusted gross income is 
$25,000 or less to contribute as much as $2,000 to an IRA and receive a full 
tax deduction for the contribution. A single worker with adjusted gross income 
between $25,000 and $35,000 may still establish an IRA and receive a partial 
deduction for contributions to the account. For example, a single worker 
earning $30,000 would be allowed to deduct up to $1,000 of the amount 
contributed to an IRA. The deduction is phased out completely once workers earn 
$35,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
Married workers with a combined adjusted gross income of $40,000 or less are 
permitted a full tax deduction for their contributions to an IRA. If both 
spouses work, the total deductable contribution would be $4,000. If only one 
spouse works, the deduction would be $2,250. The allowed deduction is reduced 
as the family's adjusted gross income rises and is phased out entirely at 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
When Congress imposed income limits on the deductibility of IRA contributions 
in 1987, critics complained that the changes made IRAs most attractive to the 
people who could least afford to contribute to them: lower-earning workers who 
need as much money as possible to meet monthly expenses. However, IRA experts 
advise workers that they should still open an IRA even if they can't afford to 
make the full tax-deductible IRA contribution allowed. You have until April 15 
to open or contribute to an IRA for the preceding year. 
</P>
<P>
One last note: Contributions to IRA accounts are not tax-free. They are 
tax-deferred. Confusion often arises because you do not pay income tax on the 
contributions for the year you actually earn the funds. However, when you 
withdraw from these accounts, you will be taxed. But because retirees generally 
fall into a lower tax bracket than a full-time working adult, your tax 
liability on the withdrawal should be lower than it would be in the year you 
actually made the contribution.

FACES: HYPER HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUNA SNOW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sean (Hollywood) Hamilton, the deejay of KIIS-FM's 7 p.m.-to-midnight shift, 
says the success of his show -- KIIS has risen from ninth to fourth place in 
that time slot since Hamilton took it over two years ago -- is due largely to 
his willingness to "get out" and make public appearances. And Hamilton hopes 
that these appearances, such as when he warmed up Sam Kinison's Universal 
Amphitheatre audience on New Year's Eve, will have the additional impact of 
bringing him a successful acting career. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, 25, has undertaken a variety of projects to make himself known as 
more than just a voice on the radio. Recent activities include commercials, 
series pilots, a Saturday morning TV show and game show appearances, and, in 
addition, Hamilton writes a gossip column for a monthly teen magazine and hosts 
benefit concerts for Students Against Drunk Driving and Teen Safe Rides. 
</P>
<P>
His teen-oriented, entertainment-magazine series, "Flip," is scheduled to go 
back on CBS' Saturday morning lineup in March; and in April, Hamilton, who is 
featured on the January covers of teen magazines Tiger Beat and Tiger Beat 
Star, 
</P>
<P>
will begin hosting a weekly cross-country radio show from KIIS. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be syndicated radio," he says of the program, "and all I can 
say is that it's revolutionary; it's never been done before, and it will make 
radio history." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hamilton has just finished taping two half-hour television pilots, 
which he hopes will air this fall. One is a MTV call-in show called "What's 
Your Beef?," and the other a comedic, Siskel- and Ebert-type review show called 
"Let's Talk About Movies," in which Hamilton stars with his KIIS sidekick 
George Reyes (called Dr. George Brothers on the show). 
</P>
<P>
"George's character is a 28-year-old virgin in a suit and tie who's . . . very 
religious and very moral," Hamilton says. "And my character -- if there's no 
sex, violence and car chases in the first three minutes (of the film), then I'm 
walking out. We critique the movie in our characters (and) we battle at 
opposite ends." 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, who in 1983 played Tommy on "One Life to Live," said he would like to 
stay with radio as long as possible, but that television has always been his 
goal. "(When) I'm trapped behind the mike (I) go insane," he says, "so I'm 
going to do as many pilots as I can, in hopes that one will be picked up."

THE NEW TOM WAITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his review of Tom Waits' New Year's Eve at the Wiltern, it seems Robert 
Hilburn missed the point entirely ("Waits Backs Away From His Best," Jan. 2). 
</P>
<P>
The piece was more an editorial than a review; more about what Hilburn feels 
Waits should or should not be doing with his music. 
</P>
<P>
By any definition, the evening was great. If I understand correctly, the tone 
of the piece implied that Hilburn doesn't approve of where Waits has gone 
musically in recent years, with new material. Strangely, Hilburn betrays his 
obvious unfamiliarity with Waits' recent work, work that originates in growth. 
This is insulting coming from a music critic. 
</P>
<P>
The evening was the best New Year's Eve -- of any year. I'm sorry Hilburn 
misrepresented the night.

The statement that, "The Boys Club itself is divided about playing malls," is 
simply not true ("Boys Club Malls Its Way Up the Charts," by Dennis Hunt, Dec. 
27). 
</P>
<P>
What is true is that there was some initial concern, from myself, as to whether 
playing in malls was a prudent career and/or business move for a group such as 
the Boys Club. 
</P>
<P>
After an initial meeting with the MCA representatives who were organizing the 
event, it became very clear that not only was it an exciting career opportunity 
but also a brilliant way to tie in the grass-roots support that is the life 
blood for a group in our position. 
</P>
<P>
As for my statement, "It's sort of embarrassing but I'll do the mall thing," my 
feeling is that we will go anywhere at anytime to find our audience, until it 
is easier for them to find us; whether it's malls, radio stations, promotion 
powerhouses in hotel ballrooms, or any other alternative venue, we will be 
there, and have been!

MISSING IN HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Dec. 26, there was a very interesting article in Calendar surveying "the men 
and women who shape Los Angeles' cultural scene" ("Dear Santa . . . ," by Times 
writers). 
</P>
<P>
While you chose to represent organization after organization in theater and 
through music, and though performance, painting and dance were all represented, 
not one of the excellent local film or video organizations was included. In the 
film and video capital of the world, this is a major omission. 
</P>
<P>
I have enclosed a list of some of the organizations you should have included: 
</P>
<P>
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, American Cinematheque, American 
Film Institute, Black American Cinema Society, Director's Guild of America, 
EZTV, FilmForum, Gay &amp; Lesbian Coalition, Independent Documentary Assn., 
Independent Feature Projects, KCET, Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, Plaza 
de la Raza, Sundance Institute, UCLA Film &amp; TV Archives, Visual 
Communications, Women in Film.

ANITA BAKER'S STILL COOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the heavy metal and rock emphasis at the top of the charts, Anita 
Baker's jazzy ballad album continues to be the nation's best seller. Another 
woman bucking the hard-rock trend: Edie Brickell. If Tracy Chapman weren't 
everyone's choice for best new artist of 1988, Brickell's achievement might be 
getting more attention. Her album, "Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars," is 
filled with oddball, poetic rock -- the kind of album that usually languishes 
in the lower depths of the Top 200. Remarkably, this one (No. 16 this week) 
appears headed for the Top 10. Another female, however, may be in trouble. 
Tiffany's "Holding an Old Friend's Hand" is slowing down, moving up just one 
notch this week -- to No. 19. The new No. 1 pop single is Bobby Brown's "My 
Prerogative." 
</P>
<P>
Industry jokesters were suggesting that the Bangles' "Everything," which seemed 
to be running out of gas after barely reaching the Top 40, be renamed 
"Nothing." But these female rockers may have the last laugh. "Everything" still 
isn't quite the blockbuster many expected, but it's not a stiff either. With a 
boost from the Bangles' Top 10 single, "In Your Room," the album climbed to No. 
33.

PBS' 'WREATH' CAPTURES THE HEART OF LONELINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The desperation of isolated, lonely people for an emotional connection to ease 
the bruising of their souls is a potent force for self-deception and 
victimization. The aching fragility of such people, particularly women, is the 
theme of an exceptional "Masterpiece Theatre" offering, "A Wreath of Roses" by 
Elizabeth Taylor (no, not the actress), which airs Sunday at 8 p.m. on Channels 
50 and 24 and at 9 p.m. on Channels 28 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
Well-directed by John Madden from a superb dramatization by Peter Prince, the 
film begins when two strangers -- Camilla (Joanna McCallum), a rigidly 
constrained single woman approaching middle-age, and Richard (Trevor Eve), a 
handsome, ex-RAF pilot -- witness a ghastly suicide at a train station. The 
year is 1949. 
</P>
<P>
The incident prompts an intimate undercurrent between the two that Camilla 
grasps with timid determination as a last chance for salvation from dreary 
spinsterhood. 
</P>
<P>
They are staying in the same quiet English village -- Richard at the local inn, 
Camilla with her best friend Liz (Elizabeth Richardson) at the home of Frances 
(Fabia Drake), a painter in her 70s. 
</P>
<P>
It is not just Camilla who is emotionally battered. Liz, a new mother, is 
treated as a child by her egocentric clergyman-husband. She chafes against it, 
but her dependent girlishness and her perceived superiority of the role of wife 
and mother are too deeply ingrained for any real change. 
</P>
<P>
Frances, a gifted artist, is forsaking her "beautiful" paintings of nature, 
women and children. She has come to regard them as lies in a world full of 
darkness and pain. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Camilla quickly sees a disturbing, unsavory side to Richard's 
personality, but she is helpless in the face of her own need. 
</P>
<P>
All the actors share scenes rich in substance; their eloquence is as much 
unspoken as spoken. Each flawlessly portrays the delicate vulnerability of 
Taylor's lost souls caught up in an inexorable human tragedy that unfolds 
against a backdrop of ordinariness -- waiting for a train, picnicking on a 
balmy day, getting caught in the rain -- and that serves as a mirror for uneasy 
contemplation. LYNNE HEFFLEY

NBC SHOWS THE GOOD AND EVIL OF 'TWIST OF FATE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You know you're in trouble almost from the beginning of "Twist of Fate" when 
two German conspirators in the plot to assassinate Hitler openly discuss the 
plan in a public bar. Why not try it through a megaphone? 
</P>
<P>
The two-part NBC drama airs at 9 p.m. Sunday and Monday on Channels 4, 36 and 
39, squandering a good cast and botching an intriguing plot that merges a Nazi 
S.S. officer and a Jewish concentration camp survivor in a single character. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, Col. Helmut Von Schraeder (Bruce Greenwood) becomes trapped inside 
the body of a Reich victim in the waning days of World War II when he persuades 
a fanatic plastic surgeon (Ian Richardson) to drastically alter his physical 
appearance and make him look like a Jew, and then to have him shipped to a 
concentration camp so he can avoid prosecution as a Nazi war criminal. 
</P>
<P>
As Ben Grossman (Ben Cross), he suffers as much as his fellow "Jewish" 
prisoners, including Max Brodsky (John Glover), the man who will become his 
best friend and rival for the affections of the lovely Deborah (Veronica 
Hamel). 
</P>
<P>
Deborah (who apparently has no last name) has spent the war in Palestine, yet 
is somehow on hand for the liberation of her fiance, Max. But then she gets a 
load of Ben and -- oh boy! 
</P>
<P>
It is Deborah who gets the prize line of the story when she quizzically 
observes somber Ben, the apparent Holocaust survivor, after he has just been 
freed from a concentration camp and remarks: "You seem so bitter." Like, 
lighten up, guy! 
</P>
<P>
The irony of "Twisted Fate" is Helmut/Ben's evolution into a celebrated soldier 
of Israel, where Deborah is radiant in her kibbutz couture and where life for 
them both is rich and full until events -- too farfetched to believe -- 
conspire to strip away his false identity. 
</P>
<P>
The eternal question that director Ian Sharp and writers Bill Bast, Paul Huson 
and Gy Waldron should have us pondering -- how can evil and goodness reside in 
the same man? -- is trivialized by this badly executed story that hinges on too 
many coincidences and is sometimes downright ridiculous. Too bad. HOWARD

Michael Apted's compelling BBC documentary, "From 7 to 28 Up," highlights 
tonight's television schedule. The 90-minute film, airing at 9 on Channel 28, 
documents the changes in the lives of a group of British youngsters over the 
course of two decades by splicing together interviews with children and young 
adults when they were 7, 14, 21 and 28 years old. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Robert Urich, Ben Cross, Dirty Harry and the "Masterpiece Theatre" 
gang will battle it out for the bulk of the prime-time audience. 
</P>
<P>
Urich stars as an aging ex-football star who falls for his son's girlfriend in 
"The Comeback," 9 p.m. on Channels 2 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
NBC counters at 9 p.m. (4)(36)(39) with the first episode of a two-part "Twist 
of Fate," a World War II story featuring Cross and Victoria Hamel. 
</P>
<P>
Clint Eastwood will shoot up the screen on ABC (7)(3)(10)(39) at 9 p.m. as 
Dirty Harry Callahan in his 1983 movie "Sudden Impact." 
</P>
<P>
And "Masterpiece Theatre" serves up "A Wreath of Roses," with Joanna McCallum 
and Trevor Eve in a story of love and death, 8 p.m. (50)(24) and 9 p.m. 
(28)(15). STEVE WEINSTEIN

This is the time of year when bare-root deciduous fruit trees abound in local 
nurseries. No other time of the year offers such a bounty of different 
varieties as our bare-root season. 
</P>
<P>
A word of caution, however, before selecting a bare-root fruit tree for your 
yard: It is crucial that the particular variety you select is suited to our 
mild climatic conditions. Many of the more popular deciduous fruit trees simply 
will not produce well here; they require colder winters than we experience. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a listing of deciduous fruit-tree varieties that will produce well in 
most Southern California climatic zones. New varieties are introduced each 
year, many from countries such as Israel that have similar climates, so keep an 
eye open for these as well.

Bears fruit beginning in mid-August, and harvest extends through October. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsett Golden -- The flavor and texture resemble that of Golden Delicious, 
except that it is slightly tart. The skin is a rich yellow color blushed with 
red. Harvest period begins in June, and it sometimes sets a smaller secondary 
crop, which is ready for harvest in November. 
</P>
<P>
Anna -- Produces a prime dessert fruit; sweet flavor, crisp juicy texture. 
Fruit color is greenish, splashed with red. Bears a crop in June and sometimes 
again in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Early Dawn -- This is a highly aromatic apple the tart -- sweet flavor of which 
is delicious either fresh or cooked. The tree is quite ornamental, with 
beautiful yellow fruit that is blushed with red. Harvest period begins in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
All of the above trees are self-fruitful (will produce fruit without another 
tree nearby for cross-pollination) except for Anna. If you plant an Anna tree, 
also plant a Dorsett Golden tree in close proximity for proper pollination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
APRICOTS 
</P>
<P>
Royal -- Also called Blenheim in some nurseries, Royal is the best bet for 
Southland growing conditions. It bears prime-quality yellowish-orange fruit of 
superb flavor and texture. Begins bearing in late spring. 
</P>
<P>
Royal is the only apricot variety I recommend for local growing conditions -- 
and even Royal can be a spotty producer if the weather is erratic during the 
blossoming period. However, as a boy growing up in the Southland, I made a good 
deal of spending money by selling to local markets the fruit of three 
magnificent old Royal apricot trees that grew in my yard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NECTARINES 
</P>
<P>
Gold Mine -- A very reliable producer of large, delicious fruit with white skin 
that is blushed red. Bears in mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
Silver Lode -- Medium-size fruit with yellow and red skin. The juicy white 
flesh is of fine quality. Harvest begins in June. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer -- Productive variety with good-flavored fruit. Yellow skin is blushed 
with red; yellow flesh. Starts bearing in early July. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PEACHES 
</P>
<P>
Florida King -- A very early peach that starts production in May. Attractive, 
large yellow fruit blushed with red. The juicy, sweet fruit features 
bright-orange flesh and a smooth texture. 
</P>
<P>
Florida Prince -- Similar to Florida King, but bears later. Medium-large fruit 
of fine flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Babcock -- This is an old favorite in the Southland that has been around for 
half a century. Medium-size fruit have pure-white flesh that turns red at the 
pit; sweet and juicy. The pretty fruit has a pink skin with a red blush. Starts 
bearing in late spring. 
</P>
<P>
Mid-Pride -- Produces medium-large yellow fruit that is blushed with red. 
Yellow flesh is freestone and has a superb, rich flavor. Very low chilling 
requirement. Begin harvest in mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
August Pride -- Produces large, round, yellow freestone fruit of fine flavor 
and texture. Very low chill requirement. The tree is large and vigorous, and 
the fruit ripens 3 weeks later than Mid-Pride. 
</P>
<P>
Desert Gold -- Very early producer of medium-size yellow fruit splashed with 
red. Yellow flesh is clingstone and of very good eating quality. Produces as 
early as May in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PEARS 
</P>
<P>
There are four pear varieties with a low-chilling requirement that will produce 
fruit in our area. The fruit quality, however, does not begin to match Bartlett 
or Comice (which will not produce well here). Trees for these low-chill 
varieties are very scarce in Southland nurseries, but if you are determined to 
grow a pear tree locally, the four low-chill varieties are: Baldwin, 
Floridahome, Fanstill and Hood. The only nurseries I know of that usually stock 
these trees are Pacific Tree Farms in Chula Vista, (619) 422-2400, and Palos 
Verdes Begonia Farm in Torrance, (213) 378-2228; phone first to make certain 
they have the trees in stock. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, two Asian pears will grow and produce fruit here -- Ya-li 
(pronounced Yah-lee) and Tsu-li (soo-lee). They must be planted together to 
cross-pollinate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PLUMS 
</P>
<P>
Santa Rosa -- This is the most reliable plum for Southern California. Large, 
juicy fruit with purple skin and yellow flesh. Begins fruit production in June. 
</P>
<P>
Satsuma -- A delicious plum with small dark-red fruit and blood-red flesh. 
Needs a Santa Rosa tree planted near it for proper pollination. Bears 
mid-summer. 
</P>
<P>
Green Gage -- An old-timer in Southland yards, it produces unusual 
greenish-yellow fruit. The golden flesh is sweet and quite juicy. Starts 
bearing in July. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Miracle -- Produces pretty yellow fruit that is blushed with red. Flesh 
is yellow with a sweet-tart flavor. This tree is a good choice for coastal 
areas, as it needs very little winter chill. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, many bare-root fruit trees that will not produce here are still 
sold locally. For instance, I went into a nursery in Long Beach last year that 
had Bing Cherry trees for sale. Bing, or any cherry variety, will not produce 
fruit anywhere in Southern California (and especially not in Long Beach) except 
for a few high elevation areas such as Beaumont and parts of the Antelope 
Valley.

JAPAN'S HIROHITO, 87, DIES AFTER A REIGN OF 62 YEARS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Emperor Hirohito's 110-day struggle for survival ended today. The monarch who 
reigned for 62 years as Japan turned to authoritarianism and war, then 
collapsed in defeat and rose again in freedom and unprecedented prosperity, 
died of complications from intestinal cancer, the Imperial Household Agency 
announced. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
Hirohito had been confined to bed since he vomited blood Sept. 19. A team of 
doctors and nurses on a round-the-clock vigil sustained him by intravenous 
feeding and nearly daily blood transfusions as he suffered internal bleeding, 
jaundice and anemia. By Friday, the emperor had received more than 67 pints of 
blood and was suffering from kidney failure. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1987, he had undergone the first operation ever performed on a 
Japanese monarch when doctors removed what they called an obstruction in his 
digestive tract. It was then, Japanese media reported, that doctors discovered 
he had cancer. The secretive Imperial Household Agency, however, had refused to 
confirm, until today, that Hirohito suffered from cancer of the duodenum, the 
section of small intestine just below the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
A nation that for years had paid little attention to him in health was 
transformed overnight into an obsession of mourning in his illness. State 
visits, festivals, receptions, and countless events smacking of celebration 
were canceled after he fell ill. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese television networks began somber news broadcasts soon after the 
announcement was made that Hirohito had died at 6:33 a.m. (1:33 p.m. Friday 
PST), replacing regular programming with detailed coverage of his death and the 
ascension of his son, Crown Prince Akihito, 55, to the throne. 
</P>
<P>
Akihito received a sacred sword and jewel, two of the three items of imperial 
regalia that are the symbols of his authority, along with imperial and national 
seals in a brief ceremony this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Officials announced that there will be a six-day period of "self-restraint" in 
government offices, which are to remain open, and recommended that the public 
observe a two-day period of mourning. A state funeral expected to draw leaders 
from around the globe will be held in 40 to 50 days at a Tokyo park. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said in a nationally televised address that 
Hirohito had ruled over an "eventful and turbulent" period of Japanese history, 
but that throughout, "the late emperor ardently wished for world peace and the 
well-being of the people, and devoted himself to these ideals." 
</P>
<P>
Hirohito was the last of the heads of state of World War II. His death ended 
the longest reign in Japan's recorded history. 
</P>
<P>
Once considered a god and "father" of his nation, nominally an absolute ruler 
and commander of 8.2 million imperial troops, Hirohito was transformed 
overnight by Japan's World War II defeat into a "human emperor," a mere "symbol 
of the unity of the Japanese people" and a servant of "international good 
will." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eventually Chief of State 
</P>
<P>
Although Japan's post-World War II constitution gave him only the ceremonial 
role of attesting to acts of government, the nation's conservative political 
leaders gradually assigned to him the position of chief of state. 
</P>
<P>
But throughout it all, his influence in government and his thoughts on a 
lifetime covering the entire span of Japan's modern history remained largely a 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
His last official appearance, however, seemed to say more than the words he was 
given to speak. That came Aug. 15 in a ceremony commemorating the end of World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
"Even now, my heart still aches," said a visibly frail and unsteady emperor, 
speaking toward an altar of 25,000 white and yellow chrysanthemums in honor of 
the war dead. "When I reflect upon the past, I am overcome with emotion." 
</P>
<P>
He had spoken similar words before. But on this occasion, 11 months after he 
underwent intestinal bypass surgery, it required a major effort for him to 
attend the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opening Up Japan 
</P>
<P>
Hirohito was born 11 years before the death of his grandfather, the Emperor 
Meiji, whose nominal restoration to full authority brought Japan out of three 
centuries of rule under shogun warriors and deliberate isolation from the rest 
of the world. He saw his nation go into alliance first with Britain, then with 
Germany and ultimately with the United States. He sat on the throne as Japan 
experimented with democracy, abandoned it for authoritarian government by 
military leaders and then became a nation that tolerated one of the broadest 
spectrums of political thought anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Yet never did he fully express his feelings on the whirlpool of events 
surrounding him. 
</P>
<P>
Raised in Spartan loneliness as a child, engaged at 17 to a 15-year-old 
princess he had seen only once and isolated from his people for the first 45 
years of his life, Hirohito once said his existence was like that "of a bird in 
a cage." 
</P>
<P>
A partial postwar opening of the "chrysanthemum curtain" in which the Imperial 
Household Agency had enveloped him never went far enough to resolve 
controversies that Hirohito finally took with him to the grave. 
</P>
<P>
It was in his name that war was declared upon the United States and Britain 
when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, and it was in his name that 
soldiers and sailors of the imperial armed forces pledged to fight to the death 
-- a pledge that led many to suicide or hiding in jungles for as long as 30 
years after the war. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surrender in His Name 
</P>
<P>
It was also in his name -- and by his order -- that the Japanese accepted 
unconditional surrender in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
And it was again in his name that Japan launched such inspired attempts to 
promote international friendship as the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and the 1970 World 
Exposition at Osaka. 
</P>
<P>
Americans who came to hate the name "Hirohito" during World War II learned 
gradually that neither he, nor any of the 123 rulers (including mythological 
ones) who preceded him, had really exercised the power ascribed to them. 
</P>
<P>
By 1971, when Hirohito became the first reigning emperor to leave Japan, 
American sentiment toward him had warmed to the point that President Richard M. 
Nixon flew from Washington to Anchorage, Alaska, to greet the emperor and 
Empress Nagako as their plane landed for refueling on a trip over the North 
Pole to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon later invited Hirohito to pay a formal visit to the United States, but 
the President's troubles with Watergate induced imperial household officials to 
resist accepting the invitation. Only after President Gerald R. Ford, in 1974, 
became the first incumbent American head of state to visit Japan did Hirohito 
accept a renewed invitation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Greeted by Mickey Mouse 
</P>
<P>
His American trip was a symbol of the importance and high esteem in which Japan 
had come to hold the United States. It also became a symbol of just how far 
Hirohito had moved from the sacrosanct position he held until 1945. He 
hobnobbed with Hollywood movie stars at banquets, was greeted by Mickey Mouse 
at Disneyland and, most astonishing to the Japanese back home, shook hands with 
all the Americans he met. In Japan, most of his public appearances were formal, 
staid affairs. 
</P>
<P>
At a banquet in Washington, Hirohito, as translated into English, referred to 
"the most unfortunate war" between the two countries, "which I deeply deplore." 
The phraseology in Japanese actually meant ". . . the war I remember with deep 
sadness." 
</P>
<P>
However, never once during his life did he choose to offer -- or was he 
permitted by imperial household officials to offer -- an overt apology for the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
A frail man who in old age suffered from nearsightedness, which hampered him in 
walking, Hirohito often could not keep his head and hands from shaking. He 
seldom smiled or showed emotion. 
</P>
<P>
He was taken from his mother when he was 70 days old, trained in humility by a 
vice admiral and noblemen in the Imperial Household Agency and taught by 
retired generals how to bear suffering in quiet. He appeared to make those 
traits part of himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Courage, Sense of History 
</P>
<P>
But the often uninspiring appearance of stiff ceremony that he presented on 
public occasions belied an inspiring degree of courage and an astonishing sense 
of history, according to many who met him in more private circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Hirohito appeared from time to time to rise above those around him to show that 
he, least of all, needed the protection showered upon him. 
</P>
<P>
Although die-hard military rulers refused to the last to accept a World War II 
surrender that would not guarantee the emperor's status and his safety, 
Hirohito himself rose above such fears. 
</P>
<P>
When an Imperial Council of military officials and government leaders was 
called after Hiroshima and Nagasaki were devastated by atomic bombs, two 
meetings failed to produce a decision. Hirohito himself had to make it -- and 
he chose surrender without assurances for his own safety. 
</P>
<P>
He also made a recording for broadcast over Japanese radio on Aug. 15, 1945 -- 
the first time his people had ever heard his voice. 
</P>
<P>
With words that Japanese even today have not forgotten, he declared the war at 
an end: 
</P>
<P>
"It is according to the dictate of time and fate that we have resolved to pave 
the way for a grand peace for all generations to come by enduring the 
unendurable and suffering the insufferable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Suffer the Insufferable' 
</P>
<P>
Forty-two days later, Hirohito himself was called upon to "suffer the 
insufferable." 
</P>
<P>
With no decision announced publicly as to his own fate in impending war crimes 
trials and with Japanese Communists staging anti-imperial demonstrations in 
Tokyo, Hirohito had expected Gen. Douglas MacArthur, supreme commander of the 
American occupation of Japan, to summon him for a meeting. But the general 
chose to wait until the emperor's staff asked for the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
To Japanese officials, it was more of a confrontation than a meeting. And, most 
humiliating of all, it was the first time an emperor of Japan had ever paid a 
call on someone else. It came about at the U.S. Embassy on Sept. 27, 1945. 
</P>
<P>
MacArthur said that he treated the emperor with respect, but the general chose 
to dress only in an open-neck khaki uniform while Hirohito wore a cutaway, 
striped trousers and top hat. A published photograph showing the two side by 
side was well calculated to show the Japanese who was boss -- and leaders of 
Japan reacted to it with a sense of shock and shame. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MacArthur's Version 
</P>
<P>
The only record available of what transpired was composed by MacArthur himself, 
who wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"He was nervous, and the stress of the past months showed plainly. I dismissed 
everyone but his own interpreter, and we sat down before an open fire at one 
end of the long reception hall. I offered him an American cigarette. . . which 
he took with thanks. I noticed how his hands shook as I lighted it for him. I 
tried to make it as easy for him as I could, but I knew how deep and dreadful 
must be his agony of humiliation. I had an uneasy feeling he might plead his 
own cause against indictment as a war criminal. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But my fears were groundless. What he said was this: 'I come to you, General 
MacArthur, to offer myself to the judgment of the powers you represent as the 
one to bear sole responsibility for every political and military decision made 
and action taken by my people in the conduct of the war.' 
</P>
<P>
"A tremendous impression swept me. The courageous assumption of a 
responsibility implicit with death, a responsibility clearly belied by facts of 
which I was fully aware, moved me to the marrow of my bones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'First Gentleman of Japan' 
</P>
<P>
"He was an emperor by inherent birth, but in that instant, I knew I faced the 
First Gentleman of Japan in his own right." 
</P>
<P>
Years later, at the first-ever "audience" for foreign correspondents in 1971, 
Hirohito had much the same effect on those who met him. To one of the 
spontaneous questions, the emperor, without hesitation, swept back over 35 
years to recall what were, in his words, the only two times he had ever 
intervened in government. 
</P>
<P>
One of those times was a 1936 coup attempt staged by young army officers in 
which, he said, he had to intervene to order vacillating army commanders to 
subdue the rebels because "leaders of the government were missing." 
</P>
<P>
The other was the surrender decision in August, 1945, which he said Japan's 
prime minister entrusted to him. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of his influence, if not power, in government was never clarified. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, a slow process of "democratization" of the emperor began. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Godlike Powers 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 1, 1946, at the behest of American occupation authorities, Hirohito 
declared publicly that he possessed none of the "godlike" powers attributed to 
him by Japan's military leaders. In 1947, a new constitution ended the fiction 
of the emperor's supreme authority and denied postwar politicians the 
opportunity to use his name as authority for their own policies and desires. 
</P>
<P>
For two years, from 1946 to 1948, Hirohito traveled 20,500 miles throughout the 
nation visiting farms, factories, schools, hospitals and refugee centers and 
trying to encourage the people to rebuild their devastated nation. It was the 
first time he had ever gone out among the people -- and on more than one 
occasion, he was mobbed by joyous crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Nearing 50 years of age, he attended a baseball game for the first time. He 
went to a sumo wrestling match for the first time. He rode in an airplane for 
the first time. He boarded a scheduled train (instead of a special train for 
himself only) for the first time. He visited a department store for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Student of Marine Biology 
</P>
<P>
The Imperial Household Agency started allowing press conferences with Japanese 
newsmen, but all questions had to be submitted in advance. The agency also 
permitted publication of scientific works by Hirohito, a devoted student of 
marine biology. Japanese officials said he was the world's leading authority on 
hydrozoans (invertebrate marine animals). 
</P>
<P>
Before the war, even passengers on passing trolleys were obliged to bow toward 
the Imperial Palace. People in upper stories of buildings had to draw shades as 
his car passed by on the street below. Few Japanese had ever seen their emperor 
in person and viewed him only in official photographs, such as one of him 
riding a white horse in military uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Nor had they heard his voice -- and when they heard it for the first time in 
the surrender broadcast, many could not understand what he was saying. 
Hirohito's court language at that time was different from everyday speech. 
</P>
<P>
But with the advent of television, the emperor's bent figure, his sleepy 
looking eyes and his hesitant footsteps became familiar. Unlike members of the 
British Royal Family, however, Hirohito was seldom the object of gossip, and 
officials who met him said little about what he was like as a person. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Imperial Consideration 
</P>
<P>
Naraichi Fujiyama, a diplomat who once served as interpreter for Hirohito, 
recalls one occasion when the emperor's consideration spared him embarrassment. 
A foreign guest had asked what kinds of birds were found in the Imperial Palace 
grounds. First ascertaining in a whisper that Fujiyama could not translate 
birds' names, Hirohito turned back to the guest and replied diplomatically: 
"All kinds of birds." 
</P>
<P>
In 1964, Parliament passed a law enabling the crown prince to act on behalf of 
the emperor to perform state duties. That opened the door to the possibility of 
a reigning emperor going abroad -- and Hirohito performed that "first," too. 
</P>
<P>
The trip came in 1971, 50 years after Hirohito had become the first crown 
prince of Japan ever to leave the country, and allowed him to retrace many of 
the steps he had taken on an earlier trip to Europe. Empress Nagako went with 
him, making her first trip abroad. 
</P>
<P>
It was, undoubtedly, a sentimental journey. Ten years earlier, on his 60th 
birthday, Hirohito had been asked what had been the happiest moments of his 
life. He named the 1921 trip. 
</P>
<P>
"Until my trip to Europe, I lived a life like that of a bird in a cage, but the 
experience I had with freedom on that trip served me greatly in the formation 
of my character as a person," he told Japanese reporters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
12,000-Ton Battleship 
</P>
<P>
That memorable experience began March 3, 1921, when Hirohito boarded a 
12,000-ton battleship. He spent six months in five European countries -- 
Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
For the one and only time in his life, he managed to sneak a ride on a subway 
in Paris. Years later, he confessed that he had never turned in the ticket and 
still kept it "carefully in a drawer of my desk." 
</P>
<P>
He also acquired a liking for Western-style breakfasts on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Two months after he returned to Japan, Hirohito was called upon to become 
prince regent to perform the official functions of his father, the Emperor 
Taisho, who had gone insane. 
</P>
<P>
The young Hirohito was given no more freedom in the selection of a wife than he 
had enjoyed in his upbringing as a child. Chosen for him because of her family 
links to an old feudal clan was Princess Nagako Kuni. They met unofficially 
once before their betrothal, again three weeks later for the betrothal itself, 
and then only nine times, never alone, in the seven years that would pass 
before their marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Hirohito was receiving instructions in 16 subjects, each taught by Japan's top 
scholars in the field, in preparation to become emperor. Nagako was taken out 
of Peer's School and similarly given instruction from 17 different tutors in 
preparation to become empress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wedding Date Postponed 
</P>
<P>
A date for his wedding to Nagako was finally set in 1923, but the great Kanto 
earthquake, which killed more than 140,000 people and devastated Tokyo, forced 
the ceremony to be postponed until Jan. 26, 1924. 
</P>
<P>
His father died on Christmas Day, 1926, and Hirohito, then only 25, assumed the 
throne (with an investiture ceremony two years later) to begin what was to be 
the longest reign in Japan's recorded history. 
</P>
<P>
It was given the name of "Showa," or the reign of enlightened peace -- and will 
now become Hirohito's posthumous name. 
</P>
<P>
His marriage to Nagako also was to become a memorable one, as the couple lived 
to celebrate their golden wedding anniversary in 1974 and their diamond wedding 
anniversary in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
With the nation -- particularly the political and military leaders -- hoping 
for a boy, Nagako gave birth to her first child in 1925. But it was a girl, 
Princess Teru. Expectations rose again when the second child was born in 1927, 
but again it was a girl, Princess Hisa. 
</P>
<P>
As the third and fourth girls, Princesses Taka and Yori, were born in 1929 and 
1931, disappointment in political and court circles turned to despair. The 
emperor was advised to take a concubine, as had many of his predecessors. 
Hirohito, however, refused, declaring that he did not wish to "disrupt the 
sanctity of marriage." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Celebration Over Son 
</P>
<P>
When the first son, Crown Prince Akihito, was born Dec. 23, 1933, the nation 
exploded with celebration. Rising Sun flags filled the grounds in front of the 
Imperial Palace as thousands of people came to pay their respects, shout "Long 
Live the Emperor!" and sing the national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
For good measure, Nagako gave birth to another son, Prince Hitachi, in 1935, 
and still another daughter, Princess Suga, in 1939. The first daughter, 
Princess Teru, died in 1961, and the second daughter, Princess Hisa, died at 6 
months. Five of the children are still alive. At his death, the emperor had 10 
grandchildren and one great-grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Never Seen as Ordinary 
</P>
<P>
Although his meeting with Gen. MacArthur stripped him of his godlike stature, 
Hirohito was never treated by the nation's postwar leaders as an ordinary human 
being. The sacrosanct aura remained and such questions as what the people 
thought of him -- and the imperial system itself -- went largely unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, average Japanese came to pay less attention to him. No longer 
was his photograph hung above family altars in homes. Some young people even 
ridiculed him by calling him "Ten-chan" ("Ten" from "Tenno," or emperor, and 
"Chan" being the appellation used in calling the name of a child). 
</P>
<P>
But the vast majority of Japanese appeared to hold Hirohito in high esteem and 
reverence. Perhaps even a kind of love was involved. Certainly, there was much 
respect for Hirohito as a man -- even more than an emperor.

SMOG CHECK EFFORT RAISES FINES, TEMPERS 
</P>

<P>
A statewide crackdown on faulty smog check stations has produced hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in fines and raised tensions between some smog check 
operators and the state Bureau of Automotive Repair. 
</P>
<P>
Bureau officials allege that some of their employees in Sacramento have been 
followed or watched by people in cars with CB radios, who apparently hoped to 
foil undercover inspections aimed at faulty operators. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, a bureau worker said in an interview that he recently 
asked for a job transfer after a confrontation with a smog shop operator. 
</P>
<P>
In West Sacramento two weeks ago, an irate garage owner, who recognized a 
Corvette awaiting a smog test as a state undercover vehicle, refused to release 
it for at least 1 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lobbyist Retained 
</P>
<P>
Complaining of a "bounty hunting" mentality among state "smog spies," about 20 
smog check operators have retained a lobbyist and public relations consultant 
and are hoping to bring pressure on the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"This is entrapment," complained Jerry Martinez, owner of a Sacramento repair 
shop and president of the newly formed California Smog Inspectors Assn., which 
will hold its organizational meeting Monday in Sacramento. Martinez 
acknowledged that he has been fined more than once. 
</P>
<P>
Leo McElroy, a public relations consultant retained by the new group, accused 
the state of "fighting the smog fighters instead of fighting the smog. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Mundy, district manager for the Bureau of Automotive Repair in 
Sacramento, said it appears some shops "are spending more time trying to keep 
from getting caught than actually just trying to do the inspection properly." 
</P>
<P>
The conflict stems from an aggressive enforcement campaign to upgrade the smog 
check program, widely seen as the centerpiece of California's smog-fighting 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, hundreds of the state's 8,300 smog check stations have been 
hit with citations and fines for issuing smog certificates for state undercover 
cars that obviously lacked basic pieces of emission-control equipment. 
</P>
<P>
In July, for example, the first full month of enhanced undercover work, 63% of 
the visibly defective state cars were issued smog certificates, according to 
Martin B. Dyer, chief of the bureau, which administers the smog check program. 
</P>
<P>
With 600 to 700 undercover visits made in each of the ensuing months, the rate 
of improperly issued certificates has declined. Yet in November, 216 stations 
-- or 32% of those visited -- issued certificates for defective cars. 
</P>
<P>
From July through November, 1,439 citations were given to smog check shops and 
1,344 went to owners or managers who improperly signed the smog certificates, 
according to bureau figures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Citation 
</P>
<P>
A station's first citation means a $250 fine, a second citation costs $750 and 
a third brings a penalty of $1,500. Four citations and the shop is out of the 
program, which Dyer said has occurred in 67 cases. 
</P>
<P>
Improperly signing the certificate means a $150 fine for the inspector on the 
first offense, $400 the second time and $650 the third. 
</P>
<P>
At the current rate, Dyer said, the undercover inspections will bring in $1 
million to $2 million in fines a year. 
</P>
<P>
Dyer said the bureau has been overt, rather than sly, about the condition of 
the cars. 
</P>
<P>
The smog test, required every two years, involves a measurement of emissions 
when a car is running in idle and a visual check to see that seven key 
components -- including the catalytic converter and air injection pump -- are 
present and properly hooked up. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dyer, one or more of these parts is deliberately removed from each 
state car brought in for inspection. 
</P>
<P>
Smog checks, started in 1984, are estimated to have cut vehicle emissions 
between 11% and 17%, according to state officials. With improvements, they say 
the program could achieve a 25% reduction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Missing Equipment 
</P>
<P>
Random roadside surveys have shown that 25% of California vehicles have missing 
or disconnected emissions-control equipment. Yet only 4% to 5% of the cars fail 
their biennial smog tests, bureau officials said. 
</P>
<P>
They acknowledged that part of the difference may result from mechanics 
rejecting cars that are missing pollution controls before the actual test is 
run. Still, they said, any station that does not flunk 10% of all cars arouses 
suspicions and makes the list of shops to be visited by undercover cars. 
</P>
<P>
"All we want to do is get them to look at every car as though it's one of 
ours," Dyer said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the improved results since July show that "the bulk of the mechanics 
are beginning to do an outstanding job." 
</P>
<P>
But some of garage owners are not pleased with the trend. 
</P>
<P>
"We accept that it's necessary to have some enforcement," McElroy said, but the 
purpose should be "to make the laws more effective," not to "maximize the 
number of fines collected." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Organization 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the new organization conceded that their chances of influencing 
the inspection program hinges on how many operators are willing to join. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the auto repair industry take a dim view of the protest effort. Jim 
Campbell, executive director of the 2,700-member California Service Station and 
Automotive Repair Assn., said his group has no "sympathy for those that don't 
do it by the numbers. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"When the public pays 20 bucks to get their car inspected, they're entitled to 
get their car inspected properly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
George Perry, a Vallejo service station owner and member of the association's 
board, said he does 300 to 500 smog tests a month and has not been cited yet. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys that are crying have been nailed by the state. . . . Is it right 
for them to do an inspection that is not valid?" Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
With 8,300 operators, it is not surprising that a few react with fury to the 
decoy operation, bureau officials said. Mundy said the level of hostility is 
manageable so far, "as long as it doesn't escalate." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Undercover Check 
</P>
<P>
In one episode Dec. 22, police were summoned to West Sacramento Auto Repair 
when owner Duke Walden refused to release a state-owned Corvette that had been 
brought to the shop for an undercover check. 
</P>
<P>
Walden acknowledged using abusive language with the driver and seizing the car 
-- saying he did it to make a point. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just not going to be harassed . . . or intimidated," Walden said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he knew it was an undercover car, Walden said: "I don't particularly 
like to tell all my secrets. . . . I have different ways of finding out." 
</P>
<P>
Dyer said faulty operators are responding, in part, to the wishes of many 
motorists to get smog certificates regardless of the condition of their 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good business to give the customer what he wants," Dyer said. "We've got 
to change what it is that makes that customer happy." 
</P>
<P>
He said the smog check program will not achieve its full potential "until a 
motorist, when he goes in for a smog check, wants a clean car," rather than "a 
piece of paper."

1ST DEFENSE FRAUD INDICTMENTS MADE; 
</P>
<P>
TELEDYNE, 3 EXECUTIVES, NAVY OFFICIAL, 2 CONSULTANTS NAMED BY GRAND JURY 
</P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government Friday brought the first charges in the Pentagon fraud case, 
accusing a unit of Teledyne Inc., three Teledyne executives, a Navy official 
and two defense consultants with crimes that include racketeering, conspiracy, 
bribery and theft of government property. 
</P>
<P>
The indictments followed guilty pleas earlier Friday on similar charges from 
defense supplier Hazeltine Corp., two of its former officers and a Washington 
marketing official for Teledyne. Hazeltine agreed to pay $1.9 million in fines 
for its part in a scheme to pay a Navy contract officer for inside information 
on a Pentagon electronics program. 
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited charges in the Operation Ill Wind investigation provide the 
outline of the government's case against Pentagon officials, weapons makers and 
consultants who allegedly bought and sold confidential information so that they 
could profit from the $150-billion-a-year military purchasing system. All those 
named in the indictments handed down Friday denied their guilt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Predicts More Charges 
</P>
<P>
Henry E. Hudson, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who is 
supervising the inquiry, said that Friday's 27-count indictment represented "a 
small percentage" of the larger government corruption case he is building. He 
predicted that more charges would be filed in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
"The citizens of the United States, I believe, have an absolute right to the 
honest services of public officials," Hudson said at a press conference 
announcing the indictments returned by the Alexandria, Va., grand jury. "And 
when individuals are receiving money for violating rules and regulations, 
passing confidential information, I think it strikes at the very heart of the 
procurement process." 
</P>
<P>
While the indictments cite little hard evidence of payoffs, wiretapped 
conversations between the consultants and contractor executives contain barely 
disguised references to money as "a little green" and "a lot of spaghetti and 
meatballs." 
</P>
<P>
The companies and individuals who were charged or who pleaded guilty Friday 
form a relatively small circle that Hudson and the Justice Department hope to 
widen to ensnare a much larger number of big players, including some of the 
nation's top defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agree to Cooperate 
</P>
<P>
The Hazeltine and Teledyne executives who admitted guilt have agreed to provide 
evidence against others in the continuing investigation, Hudson said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the firms and persons charged: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Teledyne Electronics in Newbury Park, Calif., a unit of Los Angeles-based 
Teledyne Inc., which was accused of trying to bribe a Navy official to help win 
a $24-million electronics contract. The firm, the nation's 41st-largest defense 
contractor, faces fines of up to $6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Teledyne said in a prepared statement that it "will defend itself against the 
charges and expects to be acquitted." The company denied that its conduct had 
been criminal and said that the charges "unfairly attempt to implicate them in 
actions that may have been taken by others." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Teledyne executives George H. Kaub, Eugene R. Sullivan and Dale Schnittjer, 
who were charged with conspiracy, bribery of a public official and wire fraud. 
Each faces jail terms of 50 years or more and fines of at least $1.5 million. 
Teledyne said that it would support the executives' defense efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stuart E. Berlin, a $74,304-a-year Navy electronics engineer who was 
accused of conspiracy, bribery, wire fraud and theft of government property. He 
also was charged with racketeering and conspiracy to engage in racketeering 
activities under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations 
Act. The crimes carry maximum penalties of 185 years in prison and fines of as 
much as $5.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fred H. Lackner, a Woodland Hills defense consultant and close friend of 
Berlin, who faces the same charges and potential penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 -- William L. Parkin, a consultant from Alexandria, Va., also was charged with 
racketeering, conspiracy, fraud and theft of government property. He, too, 
faces 185 years in jail and $5.5 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Justice Will Be Done' 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Harris, a lawyer for Berlin, said: "We will proceed to trial, and I'm 
confident that justice will be done and Mr. Berlin will be acquitted." 
</P>
<P>
A Navy spokesman, Lt. Brian Cullin, said Friday that Navy officials are 
reviewing the allegations against Berlin, a civilian employee who was removed 
from procurement duties in June after the probe became public. "They've got to 
review how serious the indictment is" before deciding what further action to 
take, if any, Cullin said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerard F. Treanor, Parkin's lawyer, said that his client would plead not guilty 
and predicted he would be acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
Lackner's attorney, William Dougherty, repeatedly has denied any wrongdoing by 
his client. "Mr. Lackner never paid Mr. Berlin 1 cent," he said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The men operated a simple scheme, according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Teledyne hired Parkin to help them win a contract from the Navy and Air Force 
for an aircraft electronics test kit known as the AN/APM 424, a hand-held 
device for checking radar sets. Parkin was to be paid $160,000 for his efforts 
if Teledyne won the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Parkin allegedly turned to his friend Lackner for help because of Lackner's 
access to Berlin, who held a key position in the Naval Air Systems Command 
overseeing selection of a firm to supply the test kits. Parkin agreed to split 
his consulting fees from Teledyne with Lackner, Berlin and Michael Savaides, 
Teledyne's Washington marketing representative, the indictment alleges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Silent Partner' 
</P>
<P>
Berlin, for his part, regularly provided Lackner with detailed information on 
the program and served as the consultants' "silent partner" in helping Teledyne 
win the contract, according to the government charges. 
</P>
<P>
Payments to Parkin's firm, Crest Inc., were authorized by the Teledyne 
executives, Sullivan and Kaub, the indictment states. Between December, 1985, 
and April, 1986, they issued checks to Crest totaling $10,630. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors charge that Teledyne lied to the Air Force when it certified that 
it had not hired any person or firm to help win the contract and had not 
promised money to anyone contingent on obtaining the contract. The government 
alleges that Teledyne executives promised Parkin a separate bonus of $150,000 
if the company won the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
After Teledyne won the contract in mid-1987, the company agreed to pay Parkin 
$6,250 a month for future consulting services. The government alleges that the 
payments were in fact his reward for assisting on the radar test kit contract. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Under FBI Surveillance 
</P>
<P>
Parkin in turn began issuing checks to Lackner and Savaides, who arranged to 
pay Berlin in cash, according to the indictment. On March 2, 1988, the 
government charges, Lackner and Savaides withdrew cash from a bank in 
Arlington, Va., while under FBI surveillance, and later that day Lackner met 
with Berlin, presumably to make the payoff. 
</P>
<P>
Again on May 3 and May 27, prosecutors allege, Parkin, Lackner and Savaides 
made cash payments to Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Hazeltine and three individuals agreed to waive indictment and 
plead guilty to similar charges stemming from the fraud investigation. All had 
reached plea agreements with prosecutors under which they will face no further 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guilty Pleas 
</P>
<P>
Those who entered guilty pleas before U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hazeltine Corp., which pleaded guilty to separate criminal counts of fraud, 
conversion of government property and filing a false statement. Hazeltine 
agreed to pay a total criminal fine of $1 million and separate civil claims 
totaling $500,000. It agreed also to reimburse the government $410,000 to cover 
costs of the investigation. The government declared that Hazeltine had 
"cooperated fully" in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Joseph R. Colarusso, an executive vice president at Hazeltine's offices in 
New York, who pleaded guilty to a single count of fraud and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Charles A. Furciniti, vice president of marketing at Hazeltine's offices in 
Alexandria, Va., who pleaded guilty to a single count of the same offense. The 
maximum penalty for the charge is five years in prison and a fine of $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Savaides, a marketing representative for Teledyne Electronics at the branch 
office in Arlington, Va., with responsibility for Navy procurement. Savaides 
pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy to commit bribery, which carries 
a maximum penalty of five years in jail and a fine of $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
The sentences for each of the individuals are to be determined by a judge at a 
later date. However, in all three cases the prosecution indicated that it would 
seek relatively light sentences because of their promises of cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Also Tied to Hazeltine 
</P>
<P>
Berlin also figures prominently in the matter to which Hazeltine and its former 
executives pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Colarusso and Furciniti hired Parkin for $2,000 a month in 1986 to help 
Hazeltine win a Navy contract for similar radar test gear, known as the 
UPM-150, that was potentially worth more than $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
Parkin again turned to Lackner because of his access to Berlin, telling him 
that he would give him "a little green to do what we have to do," according to 
the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alleges Payments 
</P>
<P>
The two consultants made periodic payments of between $500 and $2,000 to Berlin 
for inside information and his assistance in winning the Navy contract, the 
government charges. 
</P>
<P>
While the indictment cited no direct evidence that Berlin received payments, a 
statement of facts submitted with the guilty pleas noted that from January, 
1987, through June, 1988, Berlin wrote checks to himself averaging $1,400 per 
month, "indicating that he conducted many personal transactions in cash." 
</P>
<P>
"The records also show that he wrote no such checks during May, 1988" -- a 
month when Lackner allegedly delivered two cash payments, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Hilton set sentencing for April 28 for Savaides and March 17 for Colarusso and 
Furciniti. All three were released on personal recognizance. Those indicted 
Friday were expected to be arraigned Jan. 13.

CHIMNEY SWEEPS;

A TOUCH OF LUCK FROM A SOOTY SLEEVE

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The head of the chimney sweepers' union doesn't want to talk about the spurious 
issue of good luck -- since superstition and time-worn tradition are not 
officially regarded as recruitment incentives in the new world of socialist 
reform and modernization. 
</P>
<P>
The shortage of chimney sweeps in Prague is getting to be serious, and the 
union chief tries hard to put a high-tech modern gloss on his discussion of the 
problems of converting coal heaters to gas. But after all, this is not rocket 
science. 
</P>
<P>
"Just don't ask them about the superstition," he says hopelessly at last. "They 
don't like it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Whiff of Coal Smoke 
</P>
<P>
There is a frost of early winter on the pitched rooftops of Prague as Pepa 
Vitak and Vaclav Gebhart set out on their rounds. The sky matches the slate of 
the roofs, and their breath hangs in motionless plumes. A whiff of coal smoke 
gives its acid bite to the air. 
</P>
<P>
They wear black flannel shirts, black pants, black shoes, white caps on their 
heads. On belts around their waists are tin boxes filled with official forms. 
Vitak carries the satchel with the coiled leather rope, the steel brush on the 
end of the baseball-sized iron weight -- the trademark uniform and tools of the 
chimney sweep. 
</P>
<P>
And they are not 50 yards up the street before it begins. A little old lady, 
her morning's shopping list clutched in a dimpled fist, looks up, spies them. 
Her hand goes quickly to the button on her coat, her lips move silently. 
</P>
<P>
She is making her wish. 
</P>
<P>
Her smile, as she passes, is sly and grateful, as though she's been let in on a 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
Gebhart pretends not to notice. Vitak actually doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Human Good-Luck Charms 
</P>
<P>
Gebhart has been a chimney sweep for 18 years, Vitak for 12. It seems a part of 
the code of the chimney sweep, especially after so many years, is not to take 
obvious notice of the fact that people regard them as human good-luck charms. 
</P>
<P>
The notion that chimney sweeps are the agents of good fortune is an old 
European tradition. The superstition holds that it is good luck to touch them, 
wiping a fingertip across their sooty sleeves, or, when seeing them from a 
distance, to touch a button and make a wish. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of this, especially for a companion dressed up -- at the insistence 
of Gebhart and Vitak -- in black flannel chimney sweep gear, is like spending a 
day as a kind of enchanted person. People smile, murmur bashful greetings, 
slyly finger their coat buttons, sneak a touch on a crowded sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
However quaint chimney sweeps may seem in America, in Czechoslovakia and most 
of the rest of Eastern Europe, where houses and apartment buildings are often 
heated by individual coal stoves, chimney sweeps are in high demand. In fact, 
they are in such high demand that in some places, such as Poland, they are as 
imperious in manner as star surgeons and, some would say, just as hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
For example, there were 300 chimney sweeps working in Prague's state-run 
chimney sweep enterprise 15 years ago. Now there are 190. There are 16 working 
out of the office in Prague's Second District, where Gebhart and Vitak are 
assigned. Gebhart says they need 25. Recruiting has gotten difficult, despite 
the pay, which, at 4,500 crowns per month ($450), is above the national average 
of 3,800 crowns. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the kind of work people want to do any more," Gebhart says. "They 
want to wear white shirts and work in offices. They don't want to do work like 
this, where you get dirty." 
</P>
<P>
The backlog of work orders takes at least a week to fulfill, often longer, and 
the demand continues to rise as more of Prague's residents seek permission to 
convert from coal to gas heaters in their apartments. Such a conversion 
requires an inspection from the chimney sweeps. Likewise, any apartment 
remodeling that affects the heating system requires chimney sweep approval. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decidedly Cool Welcome 
</P>
<P>
The first call of the day for Gebhart and Vitak is such a case, and the only 
visit where their welcome is decidedly cool. On the fourth floor of a large 
apartment building, a man had remodeled his apartment and, in the process, 
blocked off three chimneys from other apartments and tapped into three others, 
although, by chimney sweep rules, he was entitled to only one. Opening his 
door, the apartment owner scowls as though a pair of large wharf rats had 
materialized on the landing. 
</P>
<P>
Just behind the chimney sweeps comes a delegation of three women from the local 
housing authority. This is, it turns out, an old dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint comes from a poor single man of impaired intelligence living 
downstairs, a man whom the rest of the building's occupants do their best to 
look after. Now, his small room fills with smoke when he tries to use his coal 
heater. For days, he has had no heat at all. His cramped room is frigid. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is resolved, somehow, by the committee of women, who tell the man 
downstairs that he will be moved to a new apartment and inform the man upstairs 
that he is to be fined and directed to return the chimneys to their original 
state. 
</P>
<P>
It is the day's only sign of conflict. Over a mid-morning break of bean soup 
and coffee in a neighborhood eatery, Gebhart says he and Vitak could have told 
the man how to get around his problem, but, as on two previous visits, he tried 
to deceive them, so they backed away and let the ladies of the committee have a 
go at him. "He shouldn't have acted like a criminal," Gebhart says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frou-Frou and Filigree 
</P>
<P>
They hurry on though the district, past once-lovely turn-of-the-century 
apartment buildings, up stairways where panels of etched glass in moderne 
designs look out over weedy gardens and where the iron scrollwork around 
windows and stair railings whisper of a vanished age before communism, when 
architects and builders could afford such frou-frou and filigree in privately 
owned buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what our fathers left to us," says Gebhart, pausing before one of the 
lovely etched windows. Then, on the next landing, where the window has been 
replaced by a plain sheet of opaque glass, he adds, "and this is what we are 
passing on to our children." 
</P>
<P>
Vitak climbs through lofts filthy with pigeon droppings and onto tile roofs, 
lowering his iron ball and brush down chimney pipes, and sits gazing over the 
rooftops of Prague while he waits for Gebhart's answer on the two-way radio -- 
the one modern device in a chimney sweep's kit, one that saves much huffing up 
and down stairs. The air is hazy with coal smoke, and the golden globes on the 
Gothic spires of the city's churches wink in the wan sunlight. Prague is a 
lovely city from any vantage point, but, from a chimney sweep's perch, it seems 
especially magical. 
</P>
<P>
"It's even better in the summer," Vitak says. "Then you have the girls, out 
sunbathing on the rooftops. On days like that, you don't want to go back to the 
office. You can stay up here all day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sprightly Woman of 92 
</P>
<P>
Their last stop is the apartment of a sprightly woman of 92, her hair died a 
brassy blonde, her enthusiasm for life undiminished by either her age or the 
fact that she now lives her life entirely in one room, the kitchen of her 
apartment, to save on coal. Her bedside table is crowded with medicines and 
nostrums. 
</P>
<P>
All she really wants from Vitak and Gebhart is to clean the ashes from her coal 
stove, and to do it quickly enough so that she makes it to the weekly meeting 
of her ladies' circle. 
</P>
<P>
Vitak does the work, and Gebhart talks, looking over adored pictures of 
grandchildren. "And this is my granddaughter, just graduated from medical 
school." 
</P>
<P>
In a few minutes, they are trooping down the stairs, meeting another elderly 
lady on the way up. She stops on the landing and stares for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at this," she says in a cooing, high-pitched voice. "Three little chimney 
sweeps. What luck I am going to have today." She reaches out with a finger, as 
though to strike a single note on a piano. 
</P>
<P>
"Bing, bing, bing," she says, her voice like a bell, touching them as they 
pass.

PAY HIKE BATTLE BREWS IN CONGRESS

President Reagan's endorsement Friday of a 50% pay increase for members of 
Congress, federal judges and top executive branch officials is certain to set 
off a full-scale political brawl on Capitol Hill early next month. 
</P>
<P>
Both opponents and supporters of the proposal expressed confidence that their 
side would prevail in the parliamentary maneuvering that will culminate on Feb. 
9, when the pay hike will take effect unless both houses of Congress have voted 
it down. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Senate is almost certain to reject the raise, House Democratic 
leaders have acknowledged that they are hoping to keep the issue from coming to 
a vote before the deadline, much as they did a year ago when Congress received 
a 15.6% pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anti-Raise Efforts Pledged 
</P>
<P>
But opponents of the raise vowed not only to lobby strenuously for its 
rejection, but also to mount a repeal effort if both chambers fail to vote 
against it within the prescribed 30-day period for taking such action. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is not going to give up after 30 days," said David L. Keating, 
executive vice president of the nonpartisan National Taxpayers Union, which 
opposes the raise. "They will just get more angry at congressional 
double-dealing on the pay raise issue." 
</P>
<P>
With the financial stakes so high and the battle lines so clearly drawn, 
congressional leaders predicted that it would be one of the most bitter and 
volatile fights Congress has seen in many years. "We'll be in the eye of the 
hurricane, even though 80% of the people affected by this do not serve in 
Congress," said Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento). 
</P>
<P>
The pay increase, which was recommended initially by a presidential commission, 
would give $135,000 a year to members of Congress, judges and federal officials 
at the level of deputy secretary. Cabinet officers would receive $155,000. The 
President's pay would rise to $300,000, but not until 1993. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letter Sent to Congress 
</P>
<P>
Reagan announced his support of the pay hike in a letter sent to members of 
Congress on Friday and pledged to incorporate the raise into the proposed 
fiscal 1989 budget that he will submit to Congress on Monday. He said the 
increase is necessary to assure that government service does not become "the 
province only of the wealthy." 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the raise, Reagan called on Congress to permanently prohibit 
its members from accepting honorariums from special-interest groups. House 
members now can keep honorariums equivalent to 30% of their $89,500 annual 
salaries, and senators can accept up to 40%. 
</P>
<P>
House and Senate leaders already have announced that they will bring 
legislation banning honorariums to a vote Feb. 10 if the 50% raise takes effect 
on the previous day. Fazio and another Californian, Rep. Jerry Lewis 
(R-Redlands) have been chosen by House leaders to work with members of the 
Senate in developing legislation banning honorariums that is acceptable to both 
chambers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Senate Rejection Expected 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and Minority Leader 
Bob Dole (R-Kan.) have pledged to schedule a vote on the pay raise in early 
February. Members of the Senate, about one-third of whom are millionaires, are 
expected to vote against it. The chamber voted down last year's pay increase 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
In the House, Rep. Robert C. Smith (R-N.H.) is preparing to introduce 
legislation to reject the increase, and Rep. Tom Tauke (R-Iowa) has submitted a 
bill that would repeal the increase once it begins. But Tauke has acknowledged 
that he thinks the House Democratic leadership "is committed to making sure 
there is no vote" on either measure. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents argued that the huge pay increase cannot be justified at a time when 
the federal government is struggling with enormous budget deficits. Tauke said 
Reagan's support for the measure would "serve to focus even more public 
attention on the issue." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sway of Letter Cited 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the increase predicted that Reagan's strong support would 
help sway many conservative Republicans who might otherwise feel obliged to 
vote against it. One source predicted that many members would send copies of 
Reagan's letter to constituents who complain about the pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
As for President-elect Bush, he announced Friday that he would support Reagan's 
decision but quickly added: "When the ball is in my court and the buck is 
stopping on my back, I might have something else to say about that. I don't 
know that we can afford anything other than to get this deficit under control."

3 PROSECUTORS FIRED OVER ARMENIA ROLES; 
</P>

4 OTHERS ASSAILED FOR FAILING TO PREVENT MURDERS IN ETHNIC CLASHES

Three state prosecutors in Soviet Armenia have been fired for failing to 
prevent the spread of ethnic unrest in the troubled republic last month, the 
Communist Party newspaper Pravda said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, four other prosecutors were severely reprimanded and another was 
told that he would not be reappointed when his term of office expires. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors all worked in districts that were the scene of clashes between 
Armenians, who are predominantly Christian, and minority Azerbaijanis, who are 
mostly Muslim. About 20 people were killed in the violence in December alone. 
</P>
<P>
The ethnic troubles are centered on Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Armenian region 
which is under the administrative rule of the republic of Azerbaijan. Armenians 
have been campaigning for a year for the area to be transferred to control of 
the Armenian republic, but Soviet authorities have rejected the demand. 
</P>
<P>
Pravda said the prosecutors had failed to prevent the murder of innocent 
individuals, and accused one of the officials of making "concessions" to the 
Karabakh committee, which has led the Armenian opposition. Tens of thousands of 
refugees have fled the area because of the violence. Soviet officials have 
accused local Armenian leaders of looking the other way or encouraging violence 
against Azerbaijanis. 
</P>
<P>
Writing in Komsomoloskaya Pravda, the Soviet youth newspaper, one of the 
country's most conservative journalists Friday complained that "parallel 
echelons of power" had arisen in Armenia in the wake of the violence and the 
devastating earthquake that killed an estimated tens of thousands last month. 
</P>
<P>
"Government services don't just fail to function," wrote Elena Losoto. "They 
refuse to accept responsibility for their actions." 
</P>
<P>
She said most services only pretend to exist and she suggested that neighboring 
Georgia was quicker to respond to the Armenian earthquake than were Armenian 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The rise of so-called "parallel structures," an apparent reference to the 
Karabakh committee and the like, will never be stopped entirely, Losoto wrote. 
She recommended the "re-creation" of the party and government apparatus in the 
republic and said that until then, the burden will have to be shouldered by 
Armenia's "Russian brother." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Warm Clothing 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Socialist Industry also criticized the Armenian authorities for 
failing to distribute accumulated aid in the aftermath of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"To this day, many people, adults and children alike, are without warm outer 
clothing or shoes," the newspaper said. "But sack loads are piled up in every 
Yerevan (the capital) warehouse and in rail cars standing at railway sidings." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the survivors of the quake had escaped harm by dashing outdoors without 
dressing against the cold and have been left to live in tents without overcoats 
and warm shoes. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said $3.8 million was needed to provide clothing and shoes for 
the victims and complained that money collected in a special bank account for 
the victims was lying unused. 
</P>
<P>
"Surely the voluntary contributions by the thousands and thousands of 
organizations and citizens of our country can be used to provide the most 
urgent needs of the countless victims of the quake," the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the news agency Reuters, the Red Army newspaper 
criticized the growth of independent political groups in Moldavia amid signs 
that a revival of nationalist sentiment among minorities has spread to the 
Soviet republic. 
</P>
<P>
Red Star, in the first detailed account to appear in the central Soviet press, 
described how groups in the republic were setting up cells in workplaces and 
rejecting contacts with the ruling Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
"One cannot help noting that activists have continuing contacts with emissaries 
arriving from similar movements in the Baltic republics and regularly exchange 
with them the experience of their work," the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Moldavia -- like the Baltic republics, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia -- was 
incorporated into the Soviet Union as a result of secret clauses in the 1939 
Nazi-Soviet pact. 
</P>
<P>
The criticism follows signs of a revival of nationalist feelings among ethnic 
Moldavians, who make up about two-thirds of the population of the 4.2 
million-strong republic, which was created in 1940 largely out of Romanian 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
In a clear parallel with developments last year in the Baltic republics, 
demands have been concentrated on national culture and language which have been 
suppressed under Soviet rule.

U.S. 'POISONED' AIR FOR CHEMICAL ARMS TALKS, SHEVARDNADZE SAYS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said Friday that the United 
States had "poisoned the atmosphere" for an international conference on 
chemical warfare by shooting down two Libyan warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
"This incident poisons the atmosphere on the eve of the conference," 
Shevardnadze said as he arrived at Paris' Orly Airport to attend the 130-nation 
meeting starting today. 
</P>
<P>
His comments to reporters seems to set the stage for a confrontation with 
Secretary of State George P. Shultz. The two men are scheduled to meet 
privately Sunday. There have been reports that Shultz hopes at that meeting to 
convince his Soviet counterpart with new evidence, apparently including 
intelligence already supplied to Western governments, that Libya is building a 
chemical plant to produce chemical weapons and to persuade him to pressure 
Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi into altering his course. 
</P>
<P>
But Shevardnadze said that Moscow remains skeptical about the U.S. charges. 
</P>
<P>
"I think no government has the right to make such an accusation without proof," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official said that leaders of France, Canada and 
Egypt told Shultz on Friday that they have no doubts about U.S. evidence 
identifying as a poison gas plant the industrial complex under construction at 
Rabta, about 40 miles southwest of the capital, Tripoli. Kadafi insists that 
the plant will produce only peaceful pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, British officials said that Britain has independent evidence 
backing the U.S. accusations that the plant is a "formidable" one capable of 
producing chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the reluctance of some other nations to endorse the U.S. position in 
public, the U.S. official said, Shultz and other U.S. representatives have been 
told in private that the evidence is persuasive. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the official said, French Premier Michel Rocard told Shultz that 
France does not doubt that the facility is a chemical weapons plant. France has 
carefully avoided making such an assessment in public. 
</P>
<P>
"We all understand what the issue is and governments will make their own 
decisions," the official said. "We are not going around seeking public 
statements." 
</P>
<P>
The Paris conference was called to reaffirm a 1925 protocol banning the use of 
poison gas weapons. The prohibition was eroded by Iraq's use of chemical 
weapons in its war with Iran and allegedly against Kurdish rebels. The 
conference runs through Thursday, although Shultz plans to return to Washington 
on Sunday after meeting with Shevardnadze, leaving Gen. William F. Burns, 
director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, to head the U.S. 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
Shultz met Friday with Rocard, French President Francois Mitterrand, French 
Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, Canadian External Affairs Minister Joe Clark, 
Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel Meguid and Swedish Foreign Minister Sten 
Sture Andersson. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official who attended the meetings said that no doubts about the U.S. 
charges were expressed. 
</P>
<P>
Clark told reporters after the meeting, "We are not skeptical; we believe that 
the capacity is there to produce chemical weapons." 
</P>
<P>
But he added, "Canada strongly hopes that this issue can be resolved by 
measures short of force." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official said that most Western governments have indicated privately 
that they believe the U.S. assertions. But he said Washington has been less 
successful in its effort to convince Western governments that private 
businesses located in those nations have assisted the Libyan plant. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two issues involved," the official said. "One is the question of the 
plant. The other is the question of whether or not there is sufficient 
information to tie companies to the plant. It's the latter that we have been 
working on."

U.S. MEDIA DRAW BONN'S IRE OVER LIBYA

Chancellor Helmut Kohl has complained to the U.S. government about accusations 
in the American media that West German companies helped to build a chemical 
weapons plant in Libya, his chief spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The West German government regards the form and content of the discussion 
being carried out through parts of the U.S. media as unhelpful," said spokesman 
Friedhelm Ost at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher revealed that Libyan 
officials told the West German ambassador in Tripoli that they agree with the 
principal of international inspections of chemical plants but only as part of 
an overall ban on chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The word passed from Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi through Ambassador Juergen 
Hellner was that Libya would allow inspections of its chemical plant under an 
international accord but refused to be singled out for challenge inspections, 
the Foreign Ministry said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talks Due in Paris 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry sources said that Genscher would try to discuss a chemical 
weapons ban with his Libyan counterpart in Paris during the conference on 
chemical weapons that begins today. They said he will also ask Secretary of 
State George P. Shultz about speculation that the United States plans to 
destroy the Libyan plant by military force. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl's spokesman Ost said that the United States has not provided the 
government with enough hard evidence on the reported involvement of West German 
companies in building the Libyan plant -- despite repeated requests from Bonn.

<P>
Ost said that Kohl had originally been told of American suspicions of West 
German companies' complicity in building the plant during the chancellor's 
visit to Washington on Nov. 15, and he promised at that time to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, American officials said they would provide detailed 
information implicating the West German firms -- singling out Imhausen-Chemie, 
based in Lahr in southwestern West Germany. But Ost said that no firm evidence 
was provided about any role of the company in supplying or building the Libyan 
chemical complex, which Kadafi has said will make pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An Expert Team' 
</P>
<P>
In discussions with the Americans, the spokesman said, "it was agreed that an 
expert team would be sent to Germany to brief German authorities." 
</P>
<P>
But the American team that discussed the case here on Dec. 22 "could not give 
any concrete information," according to Ost. 
</P>
<P>
"They just confirmed their belief that the German enterprise, Imhausen, was 
responsible for the planning of the plant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans agreed to provide further evidence, but they had not done so by 
the time the U.S. accusations became public last Sunday in an article in the 
New York Times and have not done so since, Ost said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Evidence Found 
</P>
<P>
Ost said that the West German government's investigation of Imhausen-Chemie 
covered the period 1984-88 but that "no clues were found that Imhausen-Chemie 
had exported planning documents for the construction of a chemical plant -- or 
export of know-how." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said of West 
Germany: "We are confident that it is taking the information we have provided 
very seriously and is investigating fully. With regard to the Libyan (chemical 
weapons) program, we understand that the appropriate West German authorities 
are still conducting their investigations." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Ost's public statements criticizing U.S. procedures on the matter 
seem to reflect a growing split between the United States and West Germany in 
which other issues are also involved, observers here said. These include 
low-flying military training flights by American planes, the European 
Community's ban on imports of hormone-fed U.S. meat and U.S. pressure on Bonn 
to expand the West German economy.

PRISON GUARDS GET CAPTIVITY COVERAGE

A union representing state prison guards said Friday that it has purchased 
"captivity coverage" from Lloyd's of London that will pay benefits if a 
corrections officer is taken hostage during an uprising. 
</P>
<P>
The insurance, believed to be the first of its kind, was spurred by a rebellion 
at the Coxsackie Correctional Facility last summer in which five guards were 
held hostage. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd's is underwriting the coverage for Council 82 of the Security and Law 
Enforcement Employees union. It told the 22,000-member council that it had 
never seen such a policy, union spokesman Chuck Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
Union members taken hostage by prisoners will be compensated for mental strain 
and injury, and their families will receive a death benefit if they are killed 
in captivity, Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
Benefits range from a one-time payment equal to half of a guard's annual salary 
if he is held captive at least 12 hours without injury, up to a single payment 
of twice his salary to a beneficiary if he is killed, the spokesman said. 
Corrections officers who suffer injury or disfigurement would be compensated on 
the same scale. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which covers all officers in Council 82, including policemen and 
sheriff's deputies, is financed by the union and entails no increase in union 
dues, Booth said.

NUCLEAR ACCIDENT RISK FROM SHUTTLE SATELLITE PLANT IS SMALL, NASA SAYS

NASA officials said Friday the risk of a nuclear accident will be only slight 
when it launches an interplanetary satellite containing a plutonium power plant 
later this year from the space shuttle Atlantis. 
</P>
<P>
In an environmental impact statement required by law, the space agency said 
health and environmental consequences of the "most probable" of accidents -- a 
1-in-10 million chance -- would be small. 
</P>
<P>
The inch-thick document was released by the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration and an abstract was to be published in the Federal Register. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
50 Pounds of Plutonium 
</P>
<P>
The electric generator, holding nearly 50 pounds of plutonium oxide, will be 
aboard the Galileo spacecraft scheduled for launch from the shuttle in October 
for a two-year study of Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
According to one estimate, if that amount of plutonium were released into the 
atmosphere it would have about 10 times the radioactivity of the Soviet spy 
satellite that crashed into Canada in 1978. Plutonium is used in nuclear 
weapons as well as nuclear reactors. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental impact statement calls for public comment over the succeeding 
45 days before a final statement is issued. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Small Health Risks' 
</P>
<P>
"An intensive analysis of the proposed action indicates that the possible 
health and environmental consequences of launch or mission anomalies pose small 
risks," the statement says. "The accident estimated to be the most probable 
would pose very small health risks and very small probability of environmental 
contamination." 
</P>
<P>
A nuclear generator has not been carried aboard a space shuttle before, 
although the devices have been used on space probes and manned flights to the 
moon. 
</P>
<P>
On the Galileo mission, the generator would be used to provide electricity to 
the space probe. The satellite does not have solar panels because it will 
travel too distant from the sun to draw energy.

West German police commandos on Friday stormed a hijacked bus, freeing two 
hostages and capturing two drunken gunmen who had demanded money, beer and a 
plane to Brazil, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the four hostages was slightly hurt Friday when a gunman struck him with 
his pistol butt. A 60-year-old woman was released early in the drama and 
another passenger escaped during a stop. 
</P>
<P>
The two gunmen, both in their 20s and with police records, seized the bus in a 
Bonn suburb about midnight, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The assailants demanded a ransom of up to $550,000.

Bomb experts from Czechoslovakia are due to come to Britain next week to help 
establish whether Czech-made Semtex plastic explosives blew up Pan Am Flight 
103, killing 270 people, the Foreign Office said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia has denied Semtex was responsible but offered to send experts to 
join the forensic investigation, and "the British government are grateful for 
this offer," the Foreign Office said. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia is a major manufacturer of Semtex, but its Communist Party daily 
newspaper, Rude Pravo, rejected Western terrorism experts' suppositions that 
Semtex blew up the Boeing 747 over Scotland on Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Orange-colored Semtex can be detected only by extremely sophisticated 
monitoring machines still undergoing tests in the United States. Britain says 
it has asked Czechoslovakia five times to make Semtex more easily detectable 
and until now has received no response. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-terrorism experts and U.S. State Department officials say Syria and Libya 
have obtained Semtex from Czechoslovakia and passed it on to terrorists. 
Czechoslovakia last week denied it has been supplying explosives to terrorists.

REAPPOINTMENT OF WATER BOARD CHIEF OPPOSED

<P>
Angry water distributors in the San Joaquin Valley and urban Southern 
California are campaigning against the reappointment of W. Don Maughan as 
chairman of the state Water Resources Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition to Maughan stems from a proposal made by the water board staff 
Nov. 3 to set aside more water in the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers for 
preservation of fisheries and to put a cap on future shipments of Northern 
California water to the south. 
</P>
<P>
It has drawn fierce protests from the southern half of the state, and the 
question of whether Maughan should be reappointed has become a focal point for 
the anger, even though the board has not yet taken a position on the staff 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"There are attorneys and water district managers up and down the state who 
figure the governor has a real problem," said Jason Peltier, managing director 
of the Central Valley Water Project Assn. "To say they're upset is an 
understatement. Outraged is more like it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Support 
</P>
<P>
However, there is no support for Maughan from those environmentalists who 
believe the water board staff did not go nearly far enough in curbing water 
shipments to the south and saving water for the north. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not that happy with the standards ourselves," said David Fullerton, 
spokesman for the Committee for Water Policy Consensus, in which most San 
Francisco environmental groups are represented. "We don't consider Don Maughan 
to be particularly on our side." 
</P>
<P>
The powerful five-member board has the final say -- short of the Legislature 
and the courts -- on California water rights questions. The terms of Maughan 
and another member, Elisio Samaniego of Visalia, expire Jan. 15. All board 
members are appointed by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
So far, there has been no indication from Gov. George Deukmejian's office 
whether either will be reappointed. Urban and agricultural water interests in 
the southern half of the state have expressed no opposition to Samaniego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stay on Job 
</P>
<P>
When terms of water board members have expired in the past, it has been 
customary for the governor to ask them to stay on the job until a decision is 
made on filling the job.

NEW TREASURER QUICKLY LOOKS TO 1990 ELECTION

Newly confirmed state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes was sworn into office Friday 
and immediately announced the formation of a campaign organization of top 
Republicans to guide his effort to win election to the office in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
After taking the oath of office from Gov. George Deukmejian, Hayes disclosed 
that he had appointed a steering committee composed of a number of close 
Deukmejian associates. 
</P>
<P>
Among them are Steven Merksamer, the governor's former chief of staff; Larry 
Thomas, his one-time campaign director and press secretary, and Orange County 
Supervisor Gaddi Vasquez, a former deputy appointments secretary to Deukmejian. 
Other members of the committee are former GOP Chairman Clair Burgener, Senate 
GOP leader Ken Maddy of Fresno and San Diego financier Tom Stickel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Held No Elective Office 
</P>
<P>
Help from such a committee could be crucial for Hayes, who neither held 
elective office nor belonged to a political party until Friday when he 
officially registered as a Republican. That fulfilled a commitment that he had 
made to Deukmejian when he accepted the nomination for the treasurer's job. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles attorney Kathleen Brown, a member of the Board of Public Works and 
sister of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., has already begun raising money for 
an expected run for the treasurer's office on the Democratic ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, in brief remarks to reporters after the ceremony, declined to be 
specific about his campaign plans. But he disclosed that in his first official 
act he had fired acting Treasurer Elizabeth Whitney, a protege of the late 
Democratic Treasurer Jesse M. Unruh. Hayes also replaced John Keplinger, an 
associate of Whitney who had run the Pooled Money Investment Board. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney had lobbied the Legislature to block Hayes' appointment in hopes of 
retaining her job so she could run for election in 1990 as the Democratic 
incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes did not elaborate on his relationship with Whitney, but sources indicated 
bitter feelings remain between the two. One source said that when Whitney 
called Thursday to congratulate Hayes on the Legislature's overwhelming vote to 
confirm him, he ordered her out of his new office in no uncertain terms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Anxious to Move Forward' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very anxious to move forward (into) the new position," Hayes said after 
the ceremony, adding that he will wait until next week to announce major staff 
changes. "The decisions we will make in California over the next decade to a 
large degree will dictate the quality of life we will have for our children and 
grandchildren over the next 100 years. I'm eager to participate in those 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being the official banker for the state and managing its 
$19-billion investment portfolio, the treasurer sits on dozens of boards and 
commissions that issue bonds for everything from hospital construction to 
environmental cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Through his authority to parcel out underwriting contracts and other business, 
Unruh built the treasurer's office into a powerful base from which to raise 
campaign contributions. However, voter passage last June of Proposition 73 
severely limits the amount of money that Hayes can collect from those who 
contract with the state or from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes has also pledged to institute a more competitive system in awarding 
contracts, which could further diminish his powers as a fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
Morever, while Deukmejian has offered to help Hayes with his campaign, the 
campaign-spending initiative also prevents the governor from giving any of his 
unused contributions to Hayes. Deukmejian has announced that he will not run 
for a third term but has not said how he will spend his remaining campaign 
money.

Police escorted actress Zsa Zsa Gabor off a Delta Air Lines flight after she 
refused to keep her dogs in travel kennels, an airline spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor, 69, was traveling from Los Angeles to her home in Palm Beach, Fla., with 
an assistant and two Shih Tzu dogs when the confrontation occurred Thursday 
night during a stopover at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
On the plane she "removed her two (dogs) from their kennels," airline spokesman 
William D. Berry said. "The Delta agent came aboard. He asked her six times to 
comply. She refused to comply. Each time he was responded to with considerable 
vulgarity." 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta police were called to escort Gabor off the aircraft. Dogs are not 
permitted to run free in the cabin of the plane, Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
"Passengers complained," he said. "The captain asked her to put them back in 
the kennel. All she had to do was leave the dogs in the kennel, but she would 
not comply." 
</P>
<P>
Gabor contended that the dogs were not disturbing anyone, and said the Delta 
agent on the plane "was screaming at me like I was some criminal. I was so 
upset you can't imagine. This is not the end of this," she said. "If I live to 
be 100 I'll never understand why five policemen would have to come and take me 
off the plane. As long as I live, I don't want to hear the word Delta."

The World Cycle Fair, long the bastion of bicycle dealers and exhibitors, will 
go public Sunday when the Long Beach Convention Center welcomes cyclists and 
enthusiasts anxious to know more about the latest industry trends. 
</P>
<P>
The trade show is expected to lure many of the Southland's recreational riders, 
estimated by the Colorado-based United States Cycling Federation at more than 
50,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A 'Learn-How' Show 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real hands-on and learn-how type of show," says Carla Rose of Edgell 
Expositions, the show's organizer, adding that while consumers can look, they 
will not be able to buy products at the show. 
</P>
<P>
More than 325 exhibitors will show bicycles, components, accessories, clothing 
and other cycling-related merchandise. Videos of races will be screened and 
advice offered on bicycle maintenance, riding technique, safety, correct 
bicycle fit and apparel selection. 
</P>
<P>
Several top endurance cyclists, including 1988 Race Across America winner Cindi 
Staiger, are expected at the RAAM booth and will offer a two-hour seminar on 
endurance performance. Greg LeMond, the first American male to win the Tour de 
France (in 1986), as well as members of the 7-Eleven professional cycling team 
will attend. Outside the convention center, skilled riders will give displays 
in BMX (bicycle motocross), freestyle and mountain-bike riding at various times 
throughout the day.

A 25-mile rally will be staged in conjunction with the fair, beginning from the 
Promenade (one block east of the center) at 7 a.m. and following a route 
through Long Beach. Registration begins at 6 a.m. The $12 charge includes entry 
to the cycle fair. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, when American cyclists garnered nine medals at the Los Angeles 
Olympics, there has been a burgeoning interest in the sport in Southern 
California. With more than 4,500 racers licensed by the federation (the largest 
number in the country, according to district representative Steve Ball), more 
than 100 bicycle clubs have sprung up in the Southland, offering such special 
services to cyclists as breakfast rides and rehabilitation for cardiac 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
17 Million Riders 
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based Bicycle Promotion Organization puts the number of regular 
riders nationwide at 17 million. Although bicycling is second only to swimming 
in popularity, bicycle sales have been dwindling in recent years, falling from 
12.6 million in 1987 to an 11.2-million figure estimated by the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Several exhibitors are expected to unveil new products at the cycle fair, most 
reflecting the high-tech route bicycling has taken during the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
Apparel manufacturers, catering to the increasingly fashion-conscious cyclist, 
will display their wares, which include helmets with multicolor stretch covers 
that are becoming part of cycling fashion. Then there are the slinky riding 
tights in shocking colors. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago, a lot of apparel was very plain," show director Luann Alesio 
said. "We have a lot of manufacturers introducing not only new materials but 
new colors and whole new lines." 
</P>
<P>
New materials used in bike construction also will be in evidence at the show. 
</P>
<P>
Carbon fiber, more commonly used in construction, is challenging various metals 
as the first choice of frame builders. Two years ago the Kestrel, a one-piece 
frame, set a new tone for bicycle design. Other examples of this design will go 
on display this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the carbon-composite frame is taking hold. Here in California, we 
are seeing other engineers aside from Kestrel who are working with those 
materials," said Rachelle Berlatsky-Kaplan, editor of Southwest Cycling, a 
monthly magazine with a circulation of 60,000 published in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Breakthrough Frame 
</P>
<P>
James Linck, consultant to an Irvine defense contractor, has used his knowledge 
of composites to produce a one-piece frame called the AeroLinck. Linck claims 
that the frame, which has internal storage space, is a breakthrough in frame 
design. "I expect that by the end of the century the old tube-frame bike will 
be obsolete," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The AeroLinck on display at Long Beach is expected to sell for $995, but Linck 
hopes to reduce that to "under $500" once production is fully under way. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Kenner, a longtime cyclist who works for a Boulder, Colo.-based marketing 
services company, says that while the Kestrel concept generated much 
excitement, the product was not very affordable to many. "Now it's going to be 
brought down into a popular price range," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Kenner foresees a trend this year toward lower prices -- and minor 
refinements. "Consumers are going to have to look closely to see the 
innovations," he said. "There's nothing really of the magnitude that we've seen 
in the past, such as index-shifting and quick-release pedals." 
</P>
<P>
A distinctive bicycle likely to attract attention in Long Beach is the 
Hamilton-Sattui, which triathlete Paula Newby-Fraser rode to victory and a new 
course record last year in the women's division of Hawaii's Ironman Triathlon. 
</P>
<P>
It will sit alongside four other bikes designed by South African-born 
consulting engineer Ralph Lewis, who, like other new designers, used a computer 
to aid in the frame's design. Unlike other new designs, the Hamilton-Sattui 
frames are built from steel-alloy tubing. By radically altering frame design 
and using smaller wheels, Lewis claims to have produced a lighter yet stronger 
bicycle. With the three-spoke carbon-fiber wheels he has designed, a 
Hamilton-Sattui can weigh as little as 14 1/2 pounds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Pricey Custom 
</P>
<P>
For now, custom-built versions produced in Martinez, Calif., will cost from 
$2,400 to $3,400, but when mass-scale production of the Hamilton-Sattui begins 
this year in Taiwan, the price will drop to around $1,600-$2,000, according to 
Lewis, who also has designed military vehicles and heavy trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Durability is the main attraction of a frame designed by Frank Kirk, a British 
specialist in high-pressure die-casting, whose company, Kirk Bicycles U.S.A., 
will launch the Road Ranger in Long Beach, a $950 bicycle featuring a one-piece 
cast magnesium frame. 
</P>
<P>
There will be bicycles in all price ranges at the show. Making a notable debut 
is the Hyundai bicycle, marketed by Electronics of North America Inc. According 
to marketing director Ralph Crance, eight Hyundai-brand bicycles will be 
available this year, from an entry-level bike around $199 to an aluminum model 
priced under $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
For cyclists who never want to be far away from their bicycles, Washington 
architect Harry Montague has invented a full-size folding mountain bike. His 
son, David, has joined with partner John Nelson to manufacture and market the 
Montague Biframe, which will be on display at Long Beach. The Biframe, folding 
easily to 36x36x15 inches, retails for about $460. 
</P>
<P>
But, whatever the preference, there's no need to be intimidated by the new 
technologies. At least that's the way Bicycle Promotion Organization's 
Wilkinson tells it. "You can go to the show and have fun," he said. "You don't 
have to look upon it as an educational experience. You can window-shop."

D.A. REINER PLANS '90 CAMPAIGN FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner on Friday announced his intention to 
run for state attorney general in 1990, saying he would seek that statewide 
office only if, as expected, incumbent John K. Van de Kamp, a fellow Democrat, 
runs for governor. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, who won reelection to a 4-year term in 1988, said a $1,000-per-person 
fund-raising dinner set for February in Los Angeles already has sold about 
$500,000 in tickets -- "at least double anything I've ever raised in any 
event." 
</P>
<P>
If Reiner were elected attorney general, the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors would appoint a successor to complete Reiner's term as district 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
With about 2,200 employees, including more than 800 prosecutors, the district 
attorney's office is the largest local prosecutorial agency in the country, 
handling more than 300,000 criminal cases a year on a budget of $130 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speculation Under Way 
</P>
<P>
Among those said to be considering entering the race for attorney general are 
former U.S. Rep. Dan Lungren and state Sens. John Doolittle and Larry Stirling, 
all Republicans; and San Francisco County Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith, a Democrat. 
Lungren also is mentioned as a possible Republican candidate for governor. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said on Friday it would be presumptuous as well as premature to discuss 
potential rivals or successors. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would not seek to influence the Board of Supervisors' choice of a 
successor, should that opportunity arise. "That's their decision to make. If 
they require or request any input from me, I'd be more than happy to discuss it 
with them." 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said he filed his intention to run for attorney general with the 
secretary of state on Friday so that he can begin now to raise money that is to 
be designated for the 1990 campaign, as required by the recently passed 
Proposition 73. 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, Reiner said: "I'm not beginning to campaign. That is a better 
part of a year from now. I am a candidate. I have made a decision. But 
certainly a campaign is approximately a year off." 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, 52, became district attorney by defeating incumbent Robert H. 
Philibosian in 1983. Philibosian was appointed by the Board of Supervisors to 
succeed Van de Kamp after Van de Kamp was elected attorney general in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Reiner served as city controller and city attorney of Los Angeles. He 
is a graduate of Southwestern University School of Law, and has a bachelor's 
degree in finance from the University of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said his campaign will emphasize three issues that have concerned him 
throughout his public career, the foremost being a harsher crackdown on 
juvenile offenders as a way to prevent them from becoming adult habitual 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
"The No. 1 problem is to change the way the juvenile system works," he said. 
"You've to get to the kids before they become habitual criminals." The 
solution, Reiner said, is to clamp down on youthful offenders. 
</P>
<P>
The "precursors" of criminal behavior -- truancy, drug and alcohol abuse, 
curfew violations -- should be dealt with swiftly and severely, Reiner said. 
</P>
<P>
The current practice of treating youthful offenders leniently, he said, "in 
fact affirmatively nurtures habitual criminals." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Says Rehabilitation Won't Work 
</P>
<P>
With a few exceptions, Reiner said, "the idea of rehabilitating adult habitual 
criminals is simply not in the cards. It never has been and I expect it never 
will be." 
</P>
<P>
The other themes of his 1990 campaign will be consumer and environmental 
protection, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As city attorney, Reiner said, he created the first environmental strike force 
in the country. And now in the district attorney's office, he added, "we have 
by far the largest environmental strike force in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
In consumer protection, Reiner said, he would vigorously represent the public 
before the state Public Utilities Commission to fight against unjust rate 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said that, as city attorney, his office "did something unique in the 
state of California" by assigning a full-time lawyer to argue against telephone 
rate-increase requests before the PUC. 
</P>
<P>
"As attorney general, I will replicate the type of work we did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner also said he would fight against insurance rate increases, which he 
called "probably the single most important issue in consumer protection in the 
state of California today."

YAROSLAVSKY DUCKS ONE FIGHT BUT FACES SECOND IN BID FOR REELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON and DEAN MURPHY, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Zev Yaroslavsky backed out of one political fight, he ran into another. 
</P>
<P>
Deciding against a race for mayor of Los Angeles because he thought he would 
lose, he announced that he will seek reelection as a councilman in the 
traditionally friendly 5th District, which covers much of the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday, as he was bowing out of the mayoral election, it was clear that he 
will have opposition in the council race. Three candidates for his seat -- 
including a co-chairman of his 1985 reelection campaign -- said that 
Yaroslavsky is vulnerable and they will run against him. A fourth candidate, 
Yaroslavsky ally Lisa Specht, said she will drop out. 
</P>
<P>
All the candidates had entered the council contest thinking Yaroslavsky would 
be running for mayor in the April city election. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the determination of most of the candidates to stay in the race, 
incumbents traditionally are difficult to unseat in city races because they 
have access to large amounts of campaign contributions and their names are well 
known. However, two years ago, entrenched incumbent Pat Russell was beaten in 
the adjoining 6th District on a wave of homeowner discontent similar to that 
beginning to emerge in parts of Yaroslavsky's district. 
</P>
<P>
"The overwhelming message I've gotten in the last 18 months has been that the 
people of the 5th District believe the quality of their lives has deteriorated 
over the last four years," said candidate Steve Saltzman, a former aide to 
Mayor Tom Bradley and co-chairman of Yaroslavsky's 1985 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Slow-growth advocate Laura Lake and transportation planner Ryan Snyder also 
said they are still in the running. Lake, president of Friends of Westwood, 
said that as word of Yaroslavsky's decision spread on Thursday, supporters 
urged her to "keep going." 
</P>
<P>
"He has let everybody down," Lake said. "There has been chaos and gridlock. . . 
. The people want somebody who will be their advocate, who has the interest of 
the community at heart." 
</P>
<P>
Specht, who had been considered the leading contender to succeed Yaroslavsky, 
said she would support the councilman's reelection. Specht bought a condominium 
in Century City last year and moved into the district to become eligible for 
the contest. 
</P>
<P>
Saltzman and Lake, both of whom have been raising money and walking precincts 
for months based on Yaroslavsky's assurances that he would run for mayor, said 
the councilman has lost touch with his constituents. Saltzman accused 
Yaroslavsky of spending "the past two years as a candidate almost full-time for 
mayor." 
</P>
<P>
Saltzman said he hopes to capitalize on a comment by Yaroslavsky's wife, 
Barbara, that the councilman "is getting really bored" with his council job. 
</P>
<P>
At a City Hall press conference Friday, Yaroslavsky said he is confident of 
winning reelection. 
</P>
<P>
"If you think I'm bored, then you've got to have your head examined, and that 
includes Barbara," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old Yaroslavsky, who was elected in 1975, was unopposed for 
reelection in 1981 and 1985. He needs 50% of the vote plus 1 to win the April 
11 primary. Otherwise, the top two vote-getters will meet in a June runoff. 
</P>
<P>
The 5th District includes the Beverly-Fairfax area, Century City, Bel-Air, 
Westwood, West Los Angeles and parts of Sherman Oaks, Van Nuys and North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Despite easy reelection victories in the past, Yaroslavsky is vulnerable this 
time, Lake said, because he has been "on the wrong side" of several important 
growth battles in in his district, ranging from a struggle over how many hotel 
rooms to allow in Westwood Village to parking requirements at the Ma Maison 
Sofitel Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Lake predicted voters will be looking for a council member with a strong 
environmental background who will be tougher on development issues. 
</P>
<P>
Several other homeowner leaders who have clashed with Yaroslavsky over specific 
projects in his district also said the 14-year incumbent could face a tough 
reelection. Harald Hahn, vice president of the Westside Civic Federation, a 
coalition of 15 homeowner groups, said Yaroslavsky has alienated many 
homeowners in two crucial parts of his district: the Beverly-Fairfax area, 
where Yaroslavsky lives, and Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
In the Beverly-Fairfax area, Yaroslavsky was harshly criticized by Hahn and 
others for not pushing the developer of the Ma Maison Sofitel Hotel to provide 
more parking. In Westwood, Lake and others have accused Yaroslavsky of going 
easy on the developer of a proposed expansion of the Westside Pavilion shopping 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of dissatisfaction in the district," Hahn said. "I think he is 
going to have a hard time now. He has to convince us that he does mean well." 
</P>
<P>
But other homeowners disagreed. Sara Berman, who lives near the Westside 
Pavilion, said many residents in that area view Yaroslavsky as a hero, not a 
villain, and Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., 
said homeowners there were elated to learn that Yaroslavsky will not be leaving 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the best thing to hit Sherman Oaks in years," Close said. "We are happy 
with his decision. It was good news from our part." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky's decision to seek reelection has placed some of his supporters and 
allies in awkward positions. Venice-area Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who 
endorsed Lake in September but has worked with Yaroslavsky on the council, 
would not comment Friday on Yaroslavsky's announcement, nor would she say 
whether she will continue to support Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he will endorse no one in the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect there's going to be a contest in that district, and I would prefer to 
stay out of it and let the people of the 5th District make that decision," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Filing for the odd-numbered council seats and city attorney, controller and 
mayor's offices begins Wednesday and ends Jan. 14.

* LAWMAN ACCUSED OF SBA LOAN SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles police sergeant, his brother and another man were indicted Friday 
for an alleged scheme to defraud the Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Frank Lucero, 36; his brother, Daniel T. Lucero, 37, of Baldwin Park, and 
Peter H. T. Lin, 30, of Alhambra, are accused of making false statements on an 
application for an SBA loan to open a Chinese vegetarian restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The defunct eatery, called the Beverly Hills Fung Wong restaurant, was on 
Robertson Boulevard in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Each man is charged with conspiracy. Frank Lucero is additionally charged with 
11 counts of false statements. His brother is charged with four counts of 
aiding and abetting, and Lin is charged with one false statement count. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Gary Lincenberg said the men took out a $165,000 loan, 
paying back most of the money. But, the indictment alleges, they gave the SBA 
numerous false statements to obtain the loan. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorney Howard Price said there was no criminal intent in the 
transactions.

AL MARTINEZ: A SOFT RAIN FALLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A soft rain was falling the day the Old Lady died. It misted the windshields of 
the cars on Wilshire and dampened the walkways used by those who had come to 
say goodby. Reporters and photographers were still there when I arrived because 
this was an event of significance in Los Angeles, the death of a queen called 
the Ambassador Hotel, a part of our past that danced all night. 
</P>
<P>
I had not intended to witness its final closing because the affair promised to 
be exactly what it was, a story on every front page, a segment on every 
television news show, a report on every radio station. It seemed to me everyone 
would have had enough of the Ambassador by the time I got around to saying 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
There was another reason to avoid the whole thing. You can talk all you want 
about who occupied the celebrity suites and who played the Cocoanut Grove, but 
the image of the Ambassador that haunts the memory is that of Bobby Kennedy 
lying on the kitchen floor, staring brain-dead at the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
I recall with terrible clarity the night he died. I sat alone in a darkened 
room of my home in the Berkeley hills watching the televised news reports, 
seeing the same scenes over and over again, thinking that this couldn't be 
happening to us, all this horror, and watching it finally without sound, as the 
murder played in pantomime until dawn. 
</P>
<P>
This was on my mind Tuesday when the Ambassador checked out its last guest, 
shut down its gift shop and began carting away the accouterments of commerce. 
But then I heard someone in the city room refer to the hotel as "the Old Lady," 
and the phrase evoked a different kind of imagery, the one I was talking about 
earlier, when the Lady was young and wore rhinestones. It couldn't hurt to stop 
by. I was on my way to Beaufait Avenue in Granada Hills to look at the homes 
that had been destroyed in last December's brush fires because the idea of 
caprice, of random selection, has always fascinated me. What spared one home 
and burned the other? Why hadn't it rained sooner? By whose hand are we nudged 
along the road to Armageddon? 
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador isn't exactly on the route to Beaufait, but I'd compromise. A 
quick look at the grand dame in her dated finery (one imagines sequins and 
flowing gowns) and then off to areas of more compelling attention, the 
fire-bombed homes that lay like skeletons in the rain along the charred 
northern rim of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
I had only been in the hotel a little while when I met A. Lester Rosichan, a 
dapper little man of 72 who danced with the Lady when she was in her 20s and he 
in his 30s, during the war years, when music was the last refuge of festivity. 
I'm speaking metaphorically, of course, because Lester didn't actually dance 
with the hotel but at it, far into the hours of the morning. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know what the "A" in his name stands for because he wouldn't say, but 
he did say he was in an Army artillery unit stationed at San Pedro from 1942 to 
1946 and the Ambassador was his headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Lester was making his way down the hotel's main corridor when I saw him. He 
wore slacks, a yellow leather jacket and a Greek fisherman's cap cocked 
rakishly on his head. The walk was slow, almost laborious, assisted by a cane. 
Several strokes had slowed his pace. There would be no dancing till dawn for 
Lester anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"The memories this place holds," he said, when I asked what had brought him out 
on this rainy day. "I used to come here maybe three or four times a week for 
dinner or a drink and then dancing." He hesitated for a moment, remembering, 
and then said with the satisfaction of one who has touched elusive feathers of 
the past, "I drank Glenlivet Scotch in those days." 
</P>
<P>
He met his wife 39 years ago not far from the hotel on Berendo Street where 
they both had apartments. They dated in the Cocoanut Grove. "We had such good 
times," Lester said. "I wanted to buy a trinket or something today to help me 
remember. Not anything expensive, a small thing, but the store was closed." He 
looked around and shook his head. "Well, that's it, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
I watched him shuffle slowly down the corridor past Taffy's and the London Shop 
and tried to re-create what Lester had been and what the Lady had been when the 
music played and the dancers whirled and we thought the party would never end. 
</P>
<P>
Then I left too and went to those fire-black homes in Granada Hills and stood 
in the softly falling rain, thinking about caprice, an Old Lady dying and about 
A. Lester Rosichan walking painfully down that corridor of time.

 RENAISSANCE FAIRE NEGOTIATING NEW SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Renaissance Pleasure Faire officials have been negotiating with the owners of 
Big Sky Ranch north of Simi Valley to rent about 100 acres in eastern Ventura 
County for the annual festival, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
A lease agreement is "all worked out" but access to the property on Tapo Canyon 
Road remains an obstacle to getting a permit from Ventura County, fair 
spokesman Kevin Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers have been looking for a place to hold the event since April when the 
Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission approved a developer's request 
to build a gated community on the fair's longtime site in Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
Officials must obtain a permit from the county to hold the fair on eight 
consecutive weekends this summer, county planner Paul Porter said.

STATE PANEL SAYS PEGGY BUCKEY CAN RESUME TEACHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peggy Ann Buckey, who lost her teaching credential after she was indicted in 
the McMartin Pre-School molestation case, on Friday won her fight for the right 
to return to the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
The state Commission on Teacher Credentialing, meeting in Sacramento, voted 7 
to 6, with one abstention, to endorse a proposed ruling by an administrative 
law judge, released Thursday. The judge approved Buckey's application to teach 
the deaf and learning-disabled. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's endorsement becomes effective 30 days after Buckey, 32, and 
her lawyer, John Wagner, are officially notified of the action. When she 
receives her certificate, Buckey said she will ask Anaheim Union High School 
District to reinstate her. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'She Has a Right' 
</P>
<P>
"I anticipate they will do their duty," Wagner said Friday. "She had tenure, 
and she has a right to go back. If they do not, then I will go to court. She's 
entitled to a great deal of back pay. I estimate that it will be more than 
$100,000. On March 4, she will have been out five years." 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, reached at her home late Friday, expressed elation at the news she 
would regain her teaching credential. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm overjoyed," she said. "I think it's the greatest news I've had in five 
years. I really wasn't surprised. With this case, I gave up a long time ago 
trying to predict what would happen." 
</P>
<P>
The school district's attorney, Lee Kellogg, said after Friday's vote that 
there has been "no thought" about Buckey's future, and there will be no 
discussion until an official notice of the commission decision is received. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey and seven other McMartin teachers were indicted on child molestation 
charges in March, 1984. She was suspended pending a resolution of the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sought a Credential 
</P>
<P>
When the charges against her were dropped about 18 months later, however, 
school officials denied Buckey's request for reinstatement, questioning both 
her "moral fitness" to teach and whether, in fact, she still had a credential, 
which they contended had expired. 
</P>
<P>
After failing to get her classroom job back in 1986, Buckey applied to state 
officials for a credential. She was denied. After filing suit, she won a 
hearing before Administrative Law Judge Ronald M. Gruen. The hearing lasted 
nearly three months in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In many respects, the proceeding that wound up in November was a mini-version 
of the 5-year-old McMartin molestation case, in which Peggy Ann's brother, 
Raymond Buckey, 30, and mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 61, face 65 counts of 
molestation and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
More than three dozen witnesses testified about reports of child molestation at 
the now-closed McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach. Peggy Ann Buckey was 
accused of molesting four former McMartin pupils, who testified behind closed 
doors, and killing animals as a warning to them not to tell their parents. 
</P>
<P>
Gruen was sharply critical of testimony offered by the state to connect Buckey 
with the charges, particularly a "pervasive use of leading and suggestive 
questions" in taped interviews of children who supposedly were victims of 
molestation.

COOL DAYS, EVEN COLDER NIGHTS ARE ON THE WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Friday wasn't the coldest day Southern California ever had, but with stiff 
breezes blowing down off new snow on the mountains, it was no scorcher. 
</P>
<P>
Chilly, 25-m.p.h. northeast gusts in coastal areas eased by evening, giving 
weekend temperatures a chance to rise slightly -- but not much -- from Friday's 
Los Angeles Civic Center high of 54 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Nights will continue to be cold through the weekend with lows in the 30s and 
40s, according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
Today's outlook is for some sunshine and partial cloudiness, but Dave 
Beusterien, meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts to The 
Times, said a weak upper-level storm system in Northern California means "a 
slight chance" of showers today. 
</P>
<P>
He conceded the system might miss the Southland altogether. In any event, he 
said, it should be out of the area by tonight, leaving Sunday clear. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Season Total 
</P>
<P>
The weak storm front that fluttered through here Thursday dropped .63 of an 
inch of rain at the Civic Center, bringing the season total to 5.27 inches and 
for the first time outdoing the normal season-to-date figure, 5.02. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol finally reopened Interstate 5 over the Grapevine 
north of Los Angeles early Friday afternoon after snow forced its closure at 
1:25 a.m. Groups of motorists were led through by CHP escorts beginning about 
3:30 a.m., but efforts to open the highway Friday morning were abandoned after 
a couple of accidents. 
</P>
<P>
The low temperature in downtown Los Angeles early Friday was 47 degrees. For 
the record, it got down to 30 degrees on the same date in 1913, when the 
reading never got above 47. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's high relative humidity reading in Los Angeles was 100%. The low was 
32%.

NEIGHBORHOOD IS ALL REVVED UP OVER PLAN TO CLOSE OFF STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GINGER LYNNE THOMPSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santos Rodriguez, a retired aerospace engineer, spends at least a day a week on 
the golf course with a few of his neighbors from Lafayette Square. 
</P>
<P>
They play in Whittier or Montebello, laughing, joking and discussing any issue 
that affects their lives and community -- anything, that is, except for a plan 
to close off their streets, which has caused an undercurrent of tension even 
among chums. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of a slim majority of homeowners in the exclusive neighborhood, 
the Los Angeles City Council unanimously approved plans to close the south, 
west and east entrances to the square by blocking the ends of the streets to 
create cul-de-sacs. If the plan wins final council approval on Tuesday, 237 
homeowners would be assessed $40 per year for the next 10 years to pay for the 
enclosures. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, a leading opponent of the enclosure plan, disputes the claims of his 
golfing buddies that the cul-de-sacs will eliminate crime and traffic problems 
in the area west of Crenshaw Boulevard between Venice and Washington 
boulevards. Instead, he shares the concerns of transportation engineers who say 
that closing the streets will make getting in and out inconvenient for 
residents as well as for police, fire and other emergency vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Way In and Out 
</P>
<P>
The proposed cul-de-sacs will be Buckingham Road, Virginia Road, Wellington 
Road and Victoria Avenue at Washington Boulevard. Cul-de-sacs will also be 
created on St. Charles Place at Crenshaw Boulevard and at Buckingham Road. 
Drivers will be able to get into and out of the area only from Venice 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of retired and elderly people in this neighborhood and one day 
their lives may depend on paramedics being able to get to their home in time," 
said Rodriguez, who moved to Lafayette Square with his wife and eight children 
36 years ago. "Besides, all the time we've lived here, we've never had any 
problems with crime." 
</P>
<P>
That is not the view of Rachel Lee, a leading supporter of the plan. She has 
lived in her big stucco home since 1954. 
</P>
<P>
When Lee first moved there, she said she never worried about crime. But in 
recent years, she has become concerned about gang activity on her street, 
evidenced by newly painted graffiti, and drug busts at a couple of nearby 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to preserve our neighborhood because it is being infiltrated by people 
who frighten me," said Lee, a retired elementary school teacher. "People come 
driving through here late at night, playing their music really loud." 
</P>
<P>
But opponents of the plan insist that closing off the area is not going to 
eliminate crime. 
</P>
<P>
"If crooks want to get to you, they will get to you," said Loraine Mirza, who 
moved into the neighborhood in 1975 and heads the Lafayette Community Alliance. 
"They will either drive around to Venice Boulevard, or they'll walk right up to 
your house." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Motive 
</P>
<P>
Alleviating traffic hazards was another motive for the cul-de-sacs, which were 
first called for almost 10 years ago by the Lafayette Square Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Bourdeaux, president of the group, said, "People use our roads like 
speedways. They come zooming through. . . . I've seen cars totaled right in 
front of my house." 
</P>
<P>
But 87-year-old Agnes Boston says that Lafayette Square has never had traffic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
She moved into the exclusive enclave 55 years ago when it was crisscrossed by 
country roads and inhabited only by wealthy whites because deeds to the 
properties contained strict financial and racial covenants. There are blacks 
and Latinos living in the area now, while some whites have moved out. 
</P>
<P>
"There is barely any traffic on these streets," said Boston, a retired real 
estate broker. "You can sit in your car all day and count the number of cars 
that pass my house on one hand." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Traffic Increase 
</P>
<P>
Mirza said the plan will actually increase traffic in the neighborhood because 
drivers, unaware of the enclosures, will try to use the streets to avoid the 
heavy traffic on Venice and Crenshaw boulevards, "but then they'll have to turn 
right back around when they get to Washington (Boulevard) and drive back out." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Takasaki, a city transportation engineer who has reviewed the plans, 
agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic within the square will probably be doubled, especially on the 
north-south streets," he said. "Traffic on the streets right outside the square 
will also be increased." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Nate Holden, whose district includes Lafayette Square, has not 
met with anyone from the neighborhood to discuss blocking off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a highly emotional issue. If you spend too much time with one side, 
the other side will get angry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Holden said he will rely on recommendations of the Department of 
Transportation, which is expected to report on the plan Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I am going to let the facts speak for themselves," said Holden, whose 
predecessor, David Cunningham, first brought the plan before the council. ". . 
. I am not going to ask the council to rescind their vote, unless I find out 
that the plans are unsafe." 
</P>
<P>
Safety is not the real reason the plan was proposed, Mirza contends. 
</P>
<P>
"People just want to be able to say that they live in an exclusive 
neighborhood, and they think the enclosures will increase their property 
values," she said. "I call it the snoot factor." 
</P>
<P>
Lee called that notion absurd. "We love our neighborhood and we just want to 
preserve it and get some good neighbors in here," she said.

DOCTOR, AIDES ACCUSED OF UNLAWFUL MEDICAL PRACTICE, BILLING FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Huntington Park doctor and two employees have been accused of numerous felony 
and misdemeanor counts alleging that the physician filed false Medi-Cal claims 
and the employees practiced medicine without a license, a state official said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Suresh Gandotra, 39, Carlos Cuellar, 34, and Ricardo Santos, 35, were 
arrested by state officials Thursday morning at Gandotra's Coast Urgent Care 
Medical Clinic in Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged fraudulent billing and unlawful practice of medicine has been going 
on since at least January, 1985, Deputy Atty. Gen. John Dratz said. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Gandotra knowingly hired unlicensed personnel, such as Cuellar and Santos 
. . . to medically treat patients," Dratz alleged. Gandotra was the only doctor 
at the clinic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investigation Continuing 
</P>
<P>
There is no evidence that patients treated at the 24-hour clinic were harmed, 
Dratz said. The investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators suspect that Gandotra may have defrauded Medi-Cal out of as much 
as $10,000 by billing for medical services provided by unlicensed employees and 
for services never rendered, Dratz said. 
</P>
<P>
The three were unavailable for comment Friday, said a receptionist at Coast 
Medical. 
</P>
<P>
Gandotra, who is scheduled to be arraigned Jan. 31, is free on $30,000 bail. 
Cuellar, also to be arraigned Jan. 31, posted $10,000 bail. Santos is free on 
$15,000 bail and will be arraigned Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor is accused of three felony counts of aiding and abetting forgery of 
a prescription, five felony counts of filing false medical claims, one count of 
grand theft, one misdemeanor count of aiding and abetting the unlawful practice 
of medicine and one misdemeanor count of aiding and abetting furnishing a 
dangerous drug, Dratz said. He faces a maximum state prison sentence of six 
years, Dratz said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
List of Charges 
</P>
<P>
Cuellar faces two felony counts of forging prescriptions, one misdemeanor count 
of unlawfully practicing medicine and one misdemeanor count of furnishing a 
dangerous drug, Dratz said. He faces a maximum prison term of three years, 
eight months. 
</P>
<P>
Santos is accused of two felony counts of forging prescriptions, one felony 
count of furnishing a controlled substance, two felony counts of prescribing a 
controlled substance not in the course of medical practice and one misdemeanor 
count of unlawfully practicing medicine, Dratz said. If convicted, Santos faces 
five years and eight months in prison.

PAROLED PACOIMA GANG MEMBER SOUGHT AS SUSPECT IN 2 SEPULVEDA SLAYINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A gang member on parole for a previous shooting was identified Friday by police 
as a suspect in a shooting this week in Sepulveda that left two bystanders dead 
and a third seriously wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Ford Fuqua, 27, a Pacoima man who was described as armed and dangerous, 
has been charged in an arrest warrant with two counts of murder, three counts 
of attempted murder and two counts of kidnaping, Los Angeles Police Detective 
Sandra Palmer said. His whereabouts are unknown, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators identified Fuqua as the man who accompanied Edward Furnace, 23, 
of Van Nuys to an apartment complex in the 8800 block of Langdon Avenue on 
Sunday night to find a man who had been involved in a soured drug deal. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Furnace and Fuqua planned vengeance. Once at the complex, 
they kidnaped a man and woman they didn't know at gunpoint and forced the 
couple to accompany them to an apartment where they believed their quarry 
lived, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunmen kicked open the door but found the apartment empty, investigators 
said. As they left the complex, the gunmen fired at five men standing in a back 
alley, striking three of them, police said. When the shooting started, police 
said, the kidnaped couple escaped. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Johnson, 21, of Panorama City and Brett Boswell, 28, of Saugus were 
killed in the shooting. The third man, Timothy Brown, 24, of Van Nuys, was shot 
in the back but was recovering at Northridge Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Furnace was shot in the leg by a police officer and arrested Monday morning at 
a Van Nuys apartment. Police said he was shot when he pointed an Uzi machine 
gun at an officer. 
</P>
<P>
Two women were also arrested at the apartment. Debra Elaine Frazier, 29, was 
arrested on a narcotics sales warrant. Sophina Newsome, 27, was initially 
arrested on suspicion of murder and possession of narcotics. Newsome was later 
charged with one count of possession of narcotics and one count of possession 
of a weapon by a convicted felon. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators would not say how they identified Fuqua as a suspect. He is on 
parole for shooting at an occupied dwelling, authorities said.

JONES TAKES 1-SHOT LEAD AT LA COSTA; 
</P>
<P>
10 OTHERS IN T OF C ARE IN HOT PURSUIT

<P>
The La Costa course was still wet and muddy in spots from Thursday afternoon's 
rain. A persistent wind made conditions in the MONY Tournament of Champions 
more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
However, the touring pros weren't complaining about the course Friday, saying 
it was a fair test of golf. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the conditions, a sub-par round was commendable, and 10 were 
recorded Friday. So it's a rather tightly packed field after 36 holes. 
</P>
<P>
Two newcomers to the tournament, Steve Jones and Chip Beck, were still playing 
consistently. Jones had a 69, as he did Thursday, to take a 1-stroke lead at 
138, 6 under par. 
</P>
<P>
Beck, who had a 69 on the first day, shot a 70 Friday for 139. Three players, 
Lanny Wadkins, Mark Calcavecchia and Jeff Sluman, are very much in contention 
at 141. 
</P>
<P>
So are Jay Haas, David Frost, Sandy Lyle and Ben Crenshaw at 142. Greg Norman 
and Andrew Magee, the first-day leader, are only 5 strokes behind Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Magee, who had a 68 Thursday, faltered to a 75 Friday. By contrast, Haas had 
the best round Friday with a 67 after shooting 75 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw had the roughest finish. Playing with Beck, he was 5 under par through 
16 holes. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on the 569-yard, par 17th hole, his second shot went into the water 
bordering the fairway. So did his third shot, and Crenshaw wound up taking a 
triple bogey 8 on the hole. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said his driver betrayed him early in the round, but his putting saved 
him. He made 6 birdies to offset 3 bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting a lot out of my game," said Jones, adding that he's surprised to 
be playing so well so early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said he benefited from a tip from Mac O'Grady. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember him telling me to tee it low, and then you have to stay low through 
the ball," Jones said. "I hit every green coming in and made pars (on the 13th 
hole through the 18th)." Beck said his chipping was a little bit off, but he 
still managed to make 6 birdies. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, tomorrow I won't make as many mistakes," he said. "I left myself in 
too many tight situations today. 
</P>
<P>
"It was colder today than it was Thursday, and, along with the wind and mud, it 
made judgment difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Because this is the season's first tour event, and all the players here won on 
the tour at least once in 1988, it would be premature to establish a favorite 
after 2 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
However, Wadkins, an aggressive veteran, is in a favorable position. He won 
this tournament in 1981 and 1982 and has 6 career victories in California 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
At 39, Wadkins is the oldest player in the field, and what he calls a long 
layoff hasn't affected his game. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't played since Nabisco (November)," said Wadkins, jokingly adding: 
"Unfortunately, I haven't made any money, but my wife hasn't slowed down her 
spending." 
</P>
<P>
Wadkins, a fast starter in the past, said he plays scared because he's tied 
with everyone at the start of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"All in all, I've played some solid golf the last 2 days," said Wadkins, who 
had a 70 Friday after shooting 71 Thursday. "The course was playing long coming 
in because of the wind and cold. For example, on No. 16 (a 423-yard par 4), I 
hit a driver and 1-iron and didn't get there. 
</P>
<P>
"I like this course, and you don't have to beat as many people (only 32). It's 
a good, solid test of golf and, when the rough is up in April, it's as good a 
test as you'll see." 
</P>
<P>
Haas said he was pleasantly surprised with his round, considering that he woke 
up with a cold. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to get back into the tournament. I guess you have to look out for 
the sick guys," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Haas shot a 5-under-par 31 in the first 9 holes and was even par on the back 
side. 
</P>
<P>
He recorded 5 birdies through 9 holes and added 1 more on the 16th hole. Then, 
he recorded his only bogey of the day on the tough par-5 17th hole. 
</P>
<P>
He drove into the right rough, and his second shot found the left rough. His 
third shot was about 50 yards short of the green. He then chipped onto the 
green and 2-putted. 
</P>
<P>
Haas had a hot putter most of the round. 
</P>
<P>
"I switched putters today, using one that I had won with before," he said. "It 
has a similar blade to what Crenshaw uses, and I imitated his stroke a little 
bit." 
</P>
<P>
It's doubtful that Haas will switch putters again today.

OKLAHOMA STATE RECEIVES 4-YEAR NCAA PROBATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

STILLWATER, Okla.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oklahoma State's extensive cooperation, including the testimony of players who 
gave information in return for their eligibility, saved the Cowboy football 
program from the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s death penalty, but not 
from a 4-year probation that includes the loss of bowl games, live television 
and scholarships, according to a report released Friday announcing sanctions 
against the school. 
</P>
<P>
Because of more than 40 violations, the more serious involving cash-and-car 
packages to at least one star player, Oklahoma State will be prohibited from 
playing in bowl games for the next 3 seasons, will be banned from live TV for 
the next 2 and will lose 5 scholarships in each of the next 3. 
</P>
<P>
The penalty, which is Oklahoma State's second in the last 10 years -- the 
Cowboys were put on probation in 1979 for 2 years -- could have been much 
worse. The NCAA report said the case does not fall under the "repeat" major 
violators provision, which makes the death penalty -- the elimination of a 
sport -- automatic. 
</P>
<P>
NCAA officials also considered eliminating 3 conference home games, but "in 
view of the thorough investigation and the cooperation extended by the present 
administration and coaching staff in bringing this case to a conclusion, the 
committee will withhold the application of the penalty," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma State, often an also-ran in the Big Eight Conference, just finished a 
10-2 season with a victory in the Holiday Bowl. The Cowboys figured to become a 
showcase team next season with the return of Heisman Trophy winner Barry 
Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
But because the Cowboys, however good a season they have, have not gone to 
major bowls or even appeared on network TV recently, the sanctions will have a 
relatively minimal impact, say school officials. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Pat Jones seemed to echo the sigh of relief that was heard over the 
campus after the penalties were announced. "I was surprised good," he said. 
"We've got more scholarships than I thought I might. The number reduced, very, 
very minimal. The heart of the program was not cut out." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, he talked with Sanders, his star running back, Thursday, and 
said, "Barry will be back next year and people will get to try and tackle him 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Speculation has been widespread hereabouts that Sanders, though a true junior, 
would try to move directly to the National Football League, especially if 
Oklahoma State was penalized. 
</P>
<P>
Some kind of penalty, whether more severe or not, had been anticipated since 
the NCAA told the university of its investigation in early 1986. Reports of 
cash payments to induce a recruit to sign a scholarship and subsequent monthly 
payments have circulated for some time. It appears that the NCAA was able to 
prove what was suspected. 
</P>
<P>
Although the NCAA report provided no names in outlining the violations, it has 
been widely reported that Willie Anderson was the "former assistant coach" 
referred to in the report. That coach is reported to have provided star 
receiver Hart Lee Dykes with $5,000 in cash, monthly payments of $125 the first 
year and $200 the second, and "the provision of an expensive and distinctive 
sports car at no cost to the young man." 
</P>
<P>
The former assistant coach, who left the staff in 1986, was identified as 
having been previously cited for violations at another school, the report said. 
Anderson, who was hired by Jimmy Johnson before Johnson left for Miami, 
previously coached at Clemson, which was placed on NCAA probation in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The former assistant coach figured in the first, and more serious, 16 
infractions. The other violations deal with free travel for athletes, 
girlfriends, and lesser violations. 
</P>
<P>
Other former assistants are also believed involved. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all the violations occurred between 1982 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson has since become a minister at Mount Zion Baptist Church and also 
operates as a professional agent, representing a minor league baseball player 
and gospel singer. In an interview with the Daily Oklahoman Friday, he said: 
"What I did was not immoral or against Christ's teachings. All I've ever done 
is help people." 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA, which had cited Oklahoma State in 1979 because of a "slush fund" 
operated by boosters, was not impressed with the school's return to rule 
violations, even if they were at least different in nature. However, the gusto 
with which Oklahoma State helped NCAA investigators prepare their case was a 
factor in mitigating the punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Glazier, a former NCAA investigator who now works for a Chicago law firm 
that conducts investigations for schools, said: "What the NCAA was impressed 
with was how committed the administration was to finding out what was going on. 
By the time the case got to the hearing process, they didn't have an issue 
remaining." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Oklahoma State did more than cooperate. It appears to have made the 
case. Not only did Oklahoma State self-report 11 of the violations, but Glazier 
and his operatives, who were hired by Oklahoma State almost as soon as the NCAA 
announced its own interest, turned up 12 players, including Dykes, who were 
willing to testify to the serious infractions if their eligibility could be 
protected. 
</P>
<P>
"The number of players is probably higher than other cases," said Glazier, who 
added that he has worked both sides of the desk in many major ones. "But there 
probably have been very few cases where limited immunity has not been a 
significant part of the case." 
</P>
<P>
According to Glazier, the NCAA even has a provision, that allows the use of 
immunity as an investigative tool. 
</P>
<P>
"It begins with the request from a student-athlete, who has information that 
would otherwise be unavailable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that in the summer of 1987, Jones gathered his players to advise them 
of the investigation and insisted he wanted the truth known. At that point, 
Glazier said, the players said, OK, but asked what would happen to their 
eligibility. "That leads to the immunity process," Glazier said. 
</P>
<P>
Initially it was thought that only Dykes provided key testimony, possibly 
providing the information that led to similar sanctions at Oklahoma, where he 
was also recruited. But there was additional cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
"That it works to this degree is unique," Glazier admitted. "Certainly the 
committee on sanctions was very impressed with our ability to get information. 
And we did get some valuable information." 
</P>
<P>
That lessened the punishment. Glazier, who had been an assistant director in 
enforcement before he left the NCAA, said: "That they gave 3 games back, to my 
mind, that's significant." 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma State president John Campbell, who came to the school last year, said 
he began to think the school at least wouldn't get the death penalty after his 
last session with the NCAA. But Athletic Director Myron Roderick said the 
threat remained. 
</P>
<P>
Roderick said he was highly motivated to begin a thorough and independent 
investigation because "with that death penalty out there, you better clear your 
slate." 
</P>
<P>
In any event it appears that full disclosure is highly valued by the NCAA. It 
was worth at least 3 games on next season's Oklahoma State schedule. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

MORNING BRIEFING: MADDEN HIT IT OFF WITH CO-STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember those old Miller Lite commercials with John Madden crashing through a 
paper poster? 
</P>
<P>
Madden, talking about that commercial the other day, said: "The thing that 
concerned me was I wanted to be sure and break the paper. You can imagine what 
the other guys would have said if I couldn't break the paper. 
</P>
<P>
"So on the first take, I go flying through with both hands flailing away. 
Sitting at a table right in front are Billy Martin on the left and Dick Butkus 
on the right. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit Martin with one hand right in the face, and catch Butkus with the other. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the guys you don't want to hit in the face, these two have got to be at 
the top of the list." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Mike Ditka played 12 seasons in the National Football League, 6 
with the Bears. What other two teams did he play for? (Answer below.) 
</P>
<P>
Wedding bells: Steve Garvey says he's getting married again. Garvey, whose 
first marriage ended in divorce, is engaged to marry Rebecka Mendenhal, 33, who 
works for CNN in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Garvey said they met a couple of years ago when he was at CNN to do an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave her the ring just before Christmas so it wouldn't spoil the other 
presents," Garvey said. 
</P>
<P>
From Norman Chad of the Washington Post: "NBC analyst Merlin Olsen, who was 
fairly innocuous for much of the day, bolted into inanity toward the end of the 
Fiesta Bowl with this statement: 'You sense in this ballgame the reality of 
football -- somebody wins and somebody loses.' " 
</P>
<P>
Practice makes perfect: A lot of basketball players just go through the motions 
while doing layups during pregame warm-ups. But not the North Carolina Tar 
Heels. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dean Smith doesn't want his players to develop any bad habits, so he has 
an assistant coach chart the layups, keeping track of the misses. 
</P>
<P>
From Phil Jackman of the Baltimore Evening Sun: "A college coach, defending his 
school's program, said proudly: 'My players take shop, and advanced shop. Shop 
is when you build a chair. Advanced shop is when you paint it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Ditka, who was with the Bears from 1961-66, played for the 
Philadelphia Eagles in 1967-68 and the Dallas Cowboys from 1969-72. 
</P>
<P>
Where would you rather live, in warm Phoenix or cold Buffalo? 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo strong safety Leonard Smith, who was acquired Sept. 20 in a trade with 
the Phoenix Cardinals, says he prefers Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
"I never really had a chance to get adjusted to the climate out there," he 
said. "Besides, I'm happy here." 
</P>
<P>
The drop of a hat: Would you believe a hat trick within 33 seconds? Perry 
Ganchar of the Muskegon (Mich.) Lumberjacks did it the other night in an 
International Hockey League game against the Denver Rangers. He scored his 
goals at 2:16, 2:25 and 2:49 of the first period and sent Muskegon on its way 
to a 10-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be the fastest hat trick by a minor league hockey player. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook 
</P>
<P>
Jack Kemp, the new U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development: "Pro 
football gave me a good sense of perspective when I entered the political 
arena. I had already been booed, cheered, cut, sold, traded and hung in 
effigy."

NEWSWIRE: WINFIELD SUES HIS BOSS, SEEKS FOUNDATION FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Winfield sued his boss, New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, for 
more than $1 million that the outfielder said is owed to his foundation, which 
fights drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
In a lawsuit filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Winfield charged 
that Steinbrenner has not complied with an agreement to pay $300,000 a year to 
the David M. Winfield Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner, in a statement, said a yearlong investigation of Winfield's 
foundation discovered "numerous questionable practices" that would be outlined 
in a countersuit to be filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth E. Warner, Steinbrenner's attorney, said the Yankees will complain in a 
suit of excessive and wasteful limousine travel expenses amounting to more than 
$40,000 over a 2-year period, excessive and disproportionate management and 
administrative costs and other items. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield's suit seeks $450,000 that Winfield says Steinbrenner has not paid in 
quarterly payments owed since Sept. 1, 1987. In addition, the suit seeks the 
balance owed, for a total of $1,050,000, for the 10-year life of the contract.

LOSS LEAVES CLIPPERS FEELING WORSE;

<P>
WOLF, DAILEY JOIN RANKS OF WOUNDED AS PACERS WIN, 123-88 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Clippers' skeleton crew was rattled in a big way Friday night, buried by a 
team that has new life but still had no business doing this much damage. 
</P>
<P>
The Indiana Pacers beat the Clippers like a sledgehammer, pounding them to the 
tune of 74 rebounds, the most in the National Basketball Assn. this season, in 
a 123-88 rout before 9,374 at Market Square Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The game, which featured the debut of the Pacers' new coach, Dick Versace, left 
the Clippers in worse shape than they already were, if that's possible. The 
Pacers, who were coming off a victory over Atlanta that ended a 9-game losing 
streak, rode roughshod all the way. Improving to 7-23, they joined such notable 
teams as Sacramento and Miami as winners over the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
With Danny Manning and Greg Kite home with injuries, Reggie Williams home on 
personal business and Charles Smith back but weakened after his bout with the 
flu and strep throat, the Clippers were already hurting, but by the end of the 
game, they were hurting more. As they lost their fourth game in a row on this 
trip, Joe Wolf suffered a severe bruise over his left eye in the first quarter, 
and Quintin Dailey had to have 3 stitches on his right eyebrow after a 
fourth-quarter collision. 
</P>
<P>
The carnage was everywhere. The Pacers shot 51.5%, the Clippers a season-low 
38.9%. It was the third-largest margin of victory in Pacer history, and the 
second-worst of the Clipper season. The 88 points tied the Clipper season low, 
joining the infamous loss to Miami. With the 6-foot 3-inch Dailey starting at 
small forward in a front court depleted by injuries, the Clippers managed only 
47 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't do anything, and we let them do anything they wanted, offensively 
and defensively," forward Ken Norman said after the Clippers scored just 38 
points in the second half. "We just didn't rebound and they did rebound. Our 
people were a little small, but we can't make excuses." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was some good news for the Clippers. It came from Los Angeles, 
where another examination of Manning's injured right knee by team physician 
Tony Daly brought a more positive, albeit still preliminary, diagnosis than 
that of the day before. 
</P>
<P>
"Daly said he's more optimistic than he was yesterday," General Manager Elgin 
Baylor said. "He said there was more movement and flexibility than yesterday. . 
. . But he still doesn't know the full extent of the damage, whether it's a 
partial (ligament) tear or a full tear. He'll wait and see on that." 
</P>
<P>
Manning will have his next test Monday, but the Clippers will have theirs 
Sunday in New York, when they play the Atlantic Division-leading Knicks. A 
reinforcement will arrive in the form of free agent Dave Popson, who already 
has served two previous stints with the team this season. 
</P>
<P>
Popson, a 6-10 forward who was a teammate of Wolf's at North Carolina, averaged 
2.1 points and 1.4 rebounds when he played in 8 of a possible 14 games earlier 
in the season. 
</P>
<P>
The departure of Kite, who had suffered a bruised cheekbone and fluid buildup 
in the nasal cavity, was more of a surprise. His status was said to be 
day-to-day, but Coach Gene Shue sent him home rather than take any chances. 
</P>
<P>
That left the Clippers with nine players to start the game, one more than the 
NBA minimum. By the time they lost Dailey, they were already down, 103-69. 
</P>
<P>
The Indiana lead grew in the fourth quarter, when the Clippers (10-21) misfired 
on 3-point shots as they tried to close the gap. Four times, the lead reached 
39 points. Not bad for a team that came in averaging 105.3 an outing, the 
seventh-worst mark in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"We were short bodies," said Clipper center Benoit Benjamin, who had 14 points 
and a season-high 6 blocked shots. "Big bodies, basically. They just kept 
running in fresh people." 
</P>
<P>
That's a game plan that the Clippers can only dream of these days. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Gary Grant led the Clippers with 19 points. For the Pacers, Chuck Person had 28 
points, and Wayman Tisdale had 22 points and 10 rebounds. . . . Reggie Williams 
will decide today when he will rejoin the Clippers. He returned to Los Angeles 
to be with his wife, Kathy, who underwent successful surgery Friday. . . . 
Benoit Benjamin came into the game having shot 65.6% from the field in his 
previous 8 outings, which pushed his overall mark to 55.4%. That's No. 8 in the 
league and a 6.3% improvement over his career best of last season. . . . This 
was the first NBA start of Tom Garrick. 
</P>
<P>
Before being sent home, Greg Kite got to Indiana in a roundabout way. He joined 
the Clippers for the Thursday bus ride from Milwaukee to Chicago but did not 
fly with his teammates from Chicago to Indianapolis. Doctors were concerned 
that the sensitive nasal cavity -- which is filled with fluid after he was hit 
in the face with an elbow -- would be adversely affected by the air pressure. 
Instead, he drove here. He was then apparently given clearance to fly to Los 
Angeles. . . . Vern Fleming, the Pacers' usual starting point guard, missed his 
sixth straight game with a sprained ankle. That equals his absences in the last 
4 seasons combined.

ROOKIE HELPS CAPITALS TO ANOTHER WIN

<P>
Rookie Mike Millar may finally get to unpack his suitcase and settle down in 
the Washington area, where the Capitals currently own the ice. 
</P>
<P>
Millar, who has been called up by the Capitals four times from the team's 
American Hockey League affiliate, the Baltimore Skipjacks, scored his second 
goal in as many games and goalie Pete Peeters notched his second shutout in 
three starts in defeating the Toronto Maple Leafs, 3-0, Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Millar scored his first goal of the season against the New York Rangers 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
With his help, the Capitals extended their home unbeaten streak to 9 games. 
They have gone 6-1-2 during that span. 
</P>
<P>
The Maple Leafs are 3-4-1 since George Armstrong replaced John Brophy as coach 
on Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 2, Detroit 2 -- Tony Tanti scored his 15th goal of the season with 
2:06 remaining in the third period at Detroit, giving the Canucks the tie. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Wings remained comfortably atop the weak Norris Division, but center 
Steve Yzerman failed to collect a point, ending his league-leading 
point-scoring string at 28 games. 
</P>
<P>
After Adam Oates had given Detroit a 2-1 lead at 14:50 of the final period with 
his eighth goal of the season, Tanti took a pass from Jim Sandlak inside the 
Detroit blue line and beat Red Wing goaltender Greg Stefan with a slap shot 
from 35 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The Canucks preserved the tie by killing a penalty against Stan Smyl that 
carried 1:54 into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 5, Buffalo 4 -- All Mark Johnson had to do to feel confident was to 
take a look to his left and then to his right. 
</P>
<P>
Having John MacLean and Patrik Sundstrom on the wings can do that to a person 
and to a team, and it did for the Devils and Johnson at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson scored a goal and set up goals by MacLean and Sundstrom in a 4-goal 
second period. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said: "They not only help my game, they put life into everybody's game 
with their hard work all the time. It's somewhat like the plague. It spreads." 
</P>
<P>
The Devils snapped a 6-game winless streak (0-4-2).

LAZERS PLAY HOST TO BALTIMORE TONIGHT

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having defeated the San Diego Sockers Thursday, the Lazers will try to make it 
two in a row tonight when they play host to the Baltimore Blast at 7:30 at the 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
That won't be easy for the Lazers, who have a 7-10 record and haven't put 
together a winning streak of any kind since opening the Major Indoor Soccer 
League season with two straight victories over the Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
The Blast (11-4) is in first place, leading the sixth-place Lazers by 5 games. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the victory over the defending champion Sockers, the Lazers have lost 4 
of their last 6 games. Against the Blast, they are 0-2, having been outscored, 
11-4.

NCAA IS NOT READY TO RESPOND TO THE TARKANIAN COURT DECISION

The National Collegiate Athletic Assn. infractions committee will not consider 
any response to a U.S. Supreme Court decision involving Nevada Las Vegas 
basketball Coach Jerry Tarkanian until at least April, an NCAA spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the committee will be briefed on the decision at the NCAA convention 
at San Francisco next week. But the committee will not be prepared to take any 
action when it holds its next formal meeting at San Diego Feb. 3-5, NCAA 
spokesman David Berst said. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruled Dec. 12 that the NCAA was a private agency and did not have to 
consider due process when ordering a member institution to suspend a coach. 
</P>
<P>
The decision ended a legal battle that began in 1977 when Nevada Las Vegas was 
placed on 2 years probation for basketball recruiting violations. The NCAA also 
ordered Tarkanian suspended for 2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Berst said the court decision still was being reviewed by NCAA attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"They are determining what our legal status is and what alternatives are open," 
Berst said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada Las Vegas Athletic Director Brad Rothermel said he would meet with NCAA 
officials next week and discuss possible courses of action, both by the school 
and the NCAA.

GILDER TAKES THREE-STROKE LEAD IN PRO-AM TOURNAMENT AT CARMEL

Despite calling it a "tough day," Bob Gilder shot a 3-under-par 68 Friday and 
took a 3-stroke lead over two players after three rounds of the $250,000 
Spalding Invitational Pro-Am. 
</P>
<P>
As Thursday's three co-leaders faltered under sunny and clear conditions, 
Gilder made 15 pars and sank birdie putts of 15, 32 and 7 feet at Carmel Valley 
Golf and Country Club en route to his 7-under-par 206 total. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough day for me," said Gilder, who last November won a two-man team 
tournament in Japan with Doug Tewell and also claimed the non-tour Kapalua 
International in Hawaii. "I came out a little rushed and didn't feel as good as 
I felt yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
Trailing Gilder, who began the day in a four-way tie 1 shot behind the leaders, 
are Lennie Clements, who shot even-par 70 at Carmel Valley Ranch, and Danny 
Edwards, who tied two others for low honors of the day with a 66, also at 
Carmel Valley Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Gilder, 82nd on last year's money list with $144,000, credited a new outlook on 
the game with his recently improved play. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a decision not to get upset," he said. "I just wanted to go out and 
have a good time. I used to always expect to play great, and when I didn't, I 
got very frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. Amateur winner Sam Randolph fired a 69 at Carmel Valley Ranch is 
alone in third place at 210. Seven other players, including second-round 
co-leader Rob Boldt, are within 6 strokes of the leader. 
</P>
<P>
Boldt, one of three second-round leaders after two rounds, shot 2-over-par 74 
at Poppy Hills, the most difficult of the three course being used in the 
non-tour event. The other 36-hole leaders who also played at Poppy Hills, 
suffered worse fates. 
</P>
<P>
Loren Roberts shot 76 and is at even-par 213. Greg Powers carded a 78 and is at 
215.

ARENA FOOTBALL CONSIDERS EXPANSION WITH TEAMS IN WASHINGTON, DENVER

The Arena Football League will field six teams in 1989, each playing a 12-game 
schedule, and might expand to include franchises in Washington and Denver, 
James Foster, league commissioner announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Foster said few on-field changes will be made, but the league is trying to 
restructure to stop enormous financial losses. 
</P>
<P>
"The concerns are building a better mousetrap . . . and (finding) a better way 
to run this football league," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes things that look good on paper don't work so well in reality," 
Foster said of the league's structure as a limited partnership. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the restructuring will be negotiated over the next 3 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Arena league teams lost "hundreds of thousands of dollars" in 1988, partly 
because of problems with schedules, broadcast snags with ESPN and a drop in 
publicity, Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit Drive won the arena league championship in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question there is a spirit throughout this league that people want 
this game to continue," Foster said. "It takes a lot of money to make this get 
off the ground and fly right." 
</P>
<P>
The arena league played from April through July in 1988, but the 1989 season 
will start later to avoid competition with playoffs in other sports, Foster 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 entries will be Detroit, Chicago Bruisers, Los Angeles Cobras, New 
England Steamrollers, New York Knights and Pittsburgh Gladiators.

AFTER MISTAKE, PALMER IS TEED OFF AT PGA; 
</P>
<P>
HE USES WRONG MARKERS IN SENIOR TOURNAMENT, IS PENALIZED 2 STROKES

<P>
An angry Arnold Palmer lashed out at the PGA Friday at La Costa after being 
penalized 2 strokes for teeing off from the wrong markers on the second hole in 
the second round of the MONY Tournament of Champions' senior division. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, professional golf's most popular figure, said he was so angry that he 
almost walked off the course. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason I didn't take a hike was because it was my mistake," Palmer 
said. "But I'm still upset. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the same thing I have fought since the seniors first played in this 
tournament." 
</P>
<P>
This is the only tournament in which the regular and senior touring pros play 
together. On about half the holes -- the longer ones -- the age 50-and-over 
group plays from markers closer to the green. Sometimes it's only a couple of 
club lengths, but, on occasion, it is 20 yards or more. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Palmer's playing partner, Harold Henning, birdied the first hole and 
had the honors at No. 2. He stepped up to the tee and hit his drive on the 
526-yard par 5 from the regular PGA markers, about 10 yards behind the senior 
markers. Palmer did the same. 
</P>
<P>
"The first year, I said I wouldn't play if the tees weren't the same," Palmer 
said later. "I wasn't here the next year, and they moved the seniors up a few 
yards. When they do that, it takes away from us. Dale Douglass shot the lights 
out yesterday, and people say, 'But he was hitting from the front tees,' and 
they dismiss it. It's not fair. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we should have a separate T of C." 
</P>
<P>
Douglass, who retained a 1-stroke lead in the senior division with a 72 for a 
36-hole total of 139, 5 under par, agreed with Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
"In this tournament, we have the top players in our group," Douglass said. "We 
can play the same tees as the boys. But on our regular tour, we have so many 
older guys that we need to shorten the holes or they have no chance. Here, we 
have the best. 
</P>
<P>
"The mistake on the tees could happen to anyone. Once each day my caddy has 
gone to the wrong markers. I told him, 'That's 2 strikes.' " 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is rather surprising that golfers could make a mistake such as Palmer 
and Henning made. The markers for the regular PGA Tour are white blocks with 
the T of C emblem on them. For the seniors, the markers are oversized blue golf 
balls. 
</P>
<P>
According to the rules, if Palmer and Henning had played out the second hole 
and teed off on No. 3, they would have been disqualified. But Henning's younger 
brother, Brian, tournament director of the Senior Tour, saved them. A spectator 
had informed him of the error, and Brian Henning arrived after Palmer's third 
shot on No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
He told them about the error, and they went back to the tee to start over, with 
the 2-stroke penalties. Henning took an 8 on the hole and Palmer needed only 4 
shots to get a 6, 1 over par. 
</P>
<P>
The rule states that a player may tee off as much as 2 club lengths behind the 
markers. Because they teed off farther than that behind them, they were guilty. 
"I guess I'm just stupid," Harold Henning said, after finishing with a 78 and a 
153 total. "But the markers are close together." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his anger, Palmer, who 3-putted 18, had a 74. At 149, 10 strokes behind 
Douglass, he is probably out of contention. 
</P>
<P>
"I really felt I was ready to make a move," Palmer said. "My anger is over an 
average of 10 yards. I think it's bull." 
</P>
<P>
"Brian Henning told us about the mistake. He said we would have been 
disqualified if we had finished the hole and teed off on 3. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only tournament in my career in which men tee off from different 
markers. The only exception is when we play with the women, and then the tees 
are separate. 
</P>
<P>
"I have complained from Day 1. Maybe we shouldn't be here -- or should play at 
a different time. I don't think that's exactly first-class treatment. I'm still 
upset." 
</P>
<P>
Chi Chi Rodriguez said he nearly made the same mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard some players teed off from the wrong tees yesterday," he said. "If 
they did, they signed the wrong cards and should be disqualified." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Henning said he had been told by a spectator that some players hit from 
the wrong markers Thursday. But, he said, he personally asked every player -- 
and none admitted it. 
</P>
<P>
"Notes were placed in lockers and on the first tee," Henning said. "There 
couldn't have been a misunderstanding." 
</P>
<P>
The excitement all but obliterated the feats of Miller Barber and Bruce 
Crampton as they closed in on Douglass. Barber shot a 5-under-par 67, tying Jay 
Haas of the regular tour for the best round of the day. Crampton, also at 140, 
had his second straight 70. 
</P>
<P>
It was a bad day all around for Harold Henning. He wound up tied for last place 
with Lee Elder in the field of 14 seniors and broke a New Year's resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was No. 5 on the seniors' money list last season with a career-high 
$366,230 using a long-handled putter and a pendulum stroke, he "vowed to get 
rid of my crutch (the unorthodox putter)," he had said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution lasted 1 round. He was back to the 50-inch handle Friday.

U.S. STOCKPILES EXPECTED TO DROP SHARPLY BY SPRING; 
</P>
<P>
DROUGHT JEOPARDIZES WINTER WHEAT CROP

This year's winter wheat crop, planted last autumn, is being threatened as 
drought conditions continue in one of the world's most vital grain growing 
regions -- the Midwest's wheat belt. 
</P>
<P>
With worldwide wheat supplies already at a 14-year low and drought affecting 
other wheat producing areas in Canada, Argentina and China, concern is mounting 
among farmers and economists alike over the continuing lack of snow and rain. 
</P>
<P>
American wheat supplies have been cut sharply both by an aggressive export 
program and by last year's drought. U.S. stockpiles are expected to drop to 
about 533 million bushels by spring, less than half what they were last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is still time for rainfall to save the crop, "a drought of any 
significance will mean supplies will be tight," said Edwin Young, a U.S. 
Agriculture Department economist. 
</P>
<P>
Winter wheat is used primarily for bread, and because American wheat is 
generally of such high quality, it is purchased by foreign countries and 
blended with lower quality grain to improve the nutrient value. A shortage 
could have a small impact on the price of bread in the United States but higher 
priced wheat would prove worrisome for poorer countries where wheat is a major 
source of food. 
</P>
<P>
"The drought is definitely continuing in the wheat belt," said Mike Smith, 
president of WeatherData, The Times' weather consultants. "In fact, it is far 
worse now than it was last summer." 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service predicts continued dry weather through January in 
the drought pocket, which includes the western two-thirds of Kansas -- the 
nation's most productive wheat-growing state -- the southwestern corner of 
Nebraska, parts of West Texas, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Montana. 
</P>
<P>
While there is no debate that the drought is continuing, there are differences 
of opinion about its potential impact. Agricultural experts and farmers in 
wheat-producing states are far more concerned than those in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (wheat farmers) are already looking at crop loss," said Jim Shroyer, 
Kansas' extension agronomist. "I think they're already looking at a good 10% to 
15% yield loss. The wheat looks as bad as I've seen it in 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not looking very good," said Kenny Bloom, 62, who helps farm 2,000 acres 
of wheat near Scott City, Kan. "It's dry. We just ain't had no moisture. You 
have to go clear back into the '30s to see something like this." 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion the condition of the crop is precarious in the eastern 
two-thirds of the state," said Moe Johnson, Kansas' agricultural statistician. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have a couple of months before (wheat) dormancy is going to be 
broken, but the odds are that we won't have enough moisture between now and 
then," said Kenneth G. Hubbard, Nebraska's state climatologist. 
</P>
<P>
"The signs are ominous," said Donald Wilhite, a University of Nebraska drought 
researcher. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just simply too early to start talking about that crop," countered Norton 
D. Strommen, the U.S. Agriculture Department's chief meteorologist in 
Washington. "It's been stressed, but it hasn't really been hurt, and we haven't 
had the type of weather conducive to causing major deterioration in terms of 
yield potential." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Snow Is Vital 
</P>
<P>
Winter wheat is a particularly hardy crop grown in semi-arid regions of the 
high plains east of the Rocky Mountains. Because rain is sparse even in normal 
times, wheat farmers generally leave half of their land fallow each year so the 
ground can store up enough moisture to sustain a crop. 
</P>
<P>
While drought was detected throughout most of the country beginning last 
winter, it did not emerge as a problem in wheat-producing areas until last 
autumn when the winter wheat crop was being planted. 
</P>
<P>
Because rainfall was below normal "there is some wheat that hasn't even come 
out of the ground yet and it's been planted since September," said Shroyer. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to needing moisture to germinate, snow is vital to the small wheat 
plants' winter survival. A snow cover acts as a blanket, keeping the plants and 
the ground up to 10 degrees warmer. This is vital insulation during harsh 
January and February weather. 
</P>
<P>
Snow also acts as a buffer to protect the young wheat plants from the bitter 
winter winds that blow across the Midwestern plains. Without a snow cover, 
wind-borne sand and dust "sandblast" the plants, destroying their leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of snow cover also allows the wind to desiccate plant leaves. But there is 
still time for the plants to survive the dry winter. "Rains this spring could 
bring it back," said Shroyer. "If we have a late spring and get lots of 
moisture that would be perfect." 
</P>
<P>
The drought last year reduced the 1988 harvest by 28%, the President's 
Interagency Drought Policy Committee said Friday in its final report on the 
disaster. The drop in corn yields, the nation's biggest crop, was the largest 
since the 1930s Dust Bowl days while the drop in soybean yields were the 
largest in 60 years. In all, lost production was valued at $13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Harvest of timber from public lands may have to be reduced for the next 10 to 
20 years, the task force reported, to allow time for forests to recover from 
the more than 73,000 fires that burned over 5 million acres and for 
drought-weakened trees to recover from insect infestations and disease. 
</P>
<P>
Drought will also have a long-term impact on wildlife, particularly waterfowl. 
For example the task force reported that there was a 53% decline in breeding 
pairs of ducks on the northern prairies and a 75% drop in the number of 
ducklings hatched. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers in some parts of the Midwest could still feel effects of the drought 
during the spring planting season, the report warned. "Parts of the Northern 
Plains and Western corn belt will very likely enter the 1989 crop planting 
period with significant soil moisture deficits." 
</P>
<P>
On a positive note the report concludes, "There is no evidence that the drought 
has changed the long-term tendency for agricultural productivity to outpace the 
growth in demand for farm products."

POLAROID PLAN IS UPHELD, BLOCKING BID BY SHAMROCK 
</P>

A judge upheld a controversial Polaroid Corp. employee stock ownership plan 
Friday, effectively blocking a hostile $2.6-billion takeover bid by Disney 
family-owned Shamrock Holdings Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling by Vice Chancellor Carolyn Berger of Delaware Chancery Court comes 
more than two months after the companies squared off in court over the validity 
of the stock plan, which was unveiled just before Shamrock's bid for the 
instant-camera pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
"Looks like they won," said William Relyea, an analyst with Eberstadt Fleming 
Inc. in New York. "It just raises the odds even higher that Polaroid is safe in 
the hands of management." 
</P>
<P>
Shamrock, based in Burbank, maintained that Polaroid enacted the 
10-million-share, $300-million stock plan specifically to block the takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Polaroid said it was a long-planned effort to benefit employees. 
</P>
<P>
In a 53-page ruling, Berger said the employee stock ownership plan, or ESOP, 
was partly defensive in nature but not unfair to shareholders or workers "and 
should not be invalidated." 
</P>
<P>
"It is structurally fair in its voting and tendering provisions and I do not 
find either the timing of its implementation or its possible anti-takeover 
effect objectionable under the facts of this case," Berger wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a defensive device -- assuming it is one -- that is designed to and 
appears likely to add value to the company and all of its stockholders," she 
added. "It does not prevent stockholders from receiving or considering 
alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
Shamrock spokesman John Grimaldi said the company would not comment until 
reading the decision. 
</P>
<P>
The decision all but blocks a takeover because it puts 14% of Polaroid stock in 
the hands of employees. Under Delaware takeover law, a hostile bidder must 
acquire more than 85% of a target's outstanding shares for control. Polaroid is 
incorporated in Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
Polaroid, which was founded by Edwin H. Land in 1938 and introduced instant 
snapshots 10 years later, also faces the favorable prospect of a trial in 
federal court in Boston to determine how much it will receive of a $5.7-billion 
damages request against Eastman Kodak Co. for patent infringements. 
</P>
<P>
Polaroid closed Friday at $38.25, up 50 cents, in composite New York Stock 
Exchange trading.

279,000 JOBS CREATED IN MONTH; UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINS AT 14-YEAR LOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's unemployment rate remained at a 14-year low of 5.3% in December 
while a brisk economy created 279,000 new jobs during the month, the Labor 
Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The jobs report, the last that will be issued during the Reagan Administration, 
indicated that the economy will grow steadily but not fast enough to rekindle 
fears of inflation. Although investors have feared that a tight job market 
would cause increases first in wages and then in general price levels, labor 
costs have remained fairly restrained. 
</P>
<P>
The latest unemployment estimate and the report of new employment, which 
included 34,000 new factory jobs, were in line with the expectations of 
economists and market watchers. 
</P>
<P>
"This report was almost perfect," said Allen Sinai, chief economist with the 
Boston Co. Economic Advisers. "It was strong, but not too strong. It leaves me 
still wondering when Reagan's luck will run out. Maybe when he's out of 
office." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Negatives 
</P>
<P>
"We're going into the beginning of the year with a lot of momentum," added 
David Wyss of the Data Resources economics forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass. 
"Unemployment is at a 14-year low, export-oriented industries keep expanding 
and there's not much upward pressure on wages. So I'd have a hard time finding 
anything negative in this report." 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, as the jobless rate has edged closer to full employment, new 
jobs have surged. Monthly job creation surged to an astonishing peak of 463,000 
in November. And factory payroll jobs soared by more than 400,000 for the 
second consecutive year -- more than 200,000 of them in the last three months. 
</P>
<P>
Although those factors have led some analysts to fear a sharp increase in 
wages, Friday's report found the main wage indicators virtually unchanged. 
Average hourly earnings edged up 2 cents to $9.44 after seasonal adjustment, 
while weekly earnings declined 25 cents to $327.57. 
</P>
<P>
"This report points up a trend present in most of this expansion," noted Irwin 
L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Bank in New York. "While 
we had a good gain in the number of people at work, the economy is not 
overheating and labor is not jacking up wages. That's the key point. Labor 
isn't asking for big wage increases because they now recognize the threat of 
foreign competition and they know corporations are restructuring to improve 
productivity." 
</P>
<P>
Janet L. Norwood, director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the 
competitive position of U.S. manufacturers has improved greatly in the last two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Manufacturing labor productivity has grown at an annual rate of 3.5% over this 
period," she said. "Because increases in employer costs for the compensation of 
workers have been fairly restrained, unit labor costs fell by over 1% in 1987 
and have risen only slightly over most of 1988." 
</P>
<P>
That key statistic, unexpected but crucial, has been a factor in the continuing 
manufacturing export boom that has driven economic growth for most of 1988 and 
is expected to keep expanding this year. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 404,000 new manufacturing jobs last year, Norwood noted, a third, or 
139,000, were in the export-related industries of machinery and electronics, 
directly reflecting "increased foreign demand for products manufactured in the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most New Jobs in Services 
</P>
<P>
As usual, however, the bulk of the 3.7-million new payroll jobs last year were 
created in services, with wholesale and retail trade and medical services 
leading the way. Of all non-farm jobs in the United States, 76% are now in 
service industries. 
</P>
<P>
In California last month, unemployment declined by a substantial 0.6 of a 
percentage point to 4.7%. California is one of six large states with 
unemployment below 5%. Unemployment in Massachusetts and North Carolina is 
below 4%, and the other tight labor market states are New Jersey, New York and 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
Large states faring less well are Illinois, Michigan and Ohio. Texas, still a 
casualty of the oil industry bust, limps along at 7.1%, while Florida, whose 
Sun Belt economy has fluctuated widely during the year, is at 5.5%, just above 
the national average. 
</P>
<P>
Civilian unemployment, excluding members of the armed services, was also 5.3% 
in December, down from 5.4% in November.

A QUIET TIME IN JAPAN; 
</P>
<P>
SUBDUED WORK, TRAVEL PRACTICES FOLLOW EMPEROR'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Japan's powerful economic machine began to tone itself down in observance of 
the death of Emperor Hirohito, but its factories will continue to hum 
throughout a period of mourning that seems likely to have a largely cosmetic 
effect on global business. 
</P>
<P>
While movies were canceled on some Japanese airlines and flight attendants 
donned more conservative outfits, a 60-second period of meditation at Toyota's 
domestic plants was timed to avoid any loss of production on the auto assembly 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
The chief economic impact could be felt in the travel industry, officials 
speculated, as both corporate and personal travel plans were being canceled or 
postponed for periods that range from a few days to two months. 
</P>
<P>
In some Japanese corporate board rooms, today was the "X Day" that had been 
anticipated ever since the emperor fell ill last fall. Contingency plans that 
business executives had previously refused to discuss were quickly put into 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
They included temporary suspensions of advertising campaigns in Japan and, to a 
small extent, in the United States; a mandate for dark, conservative clothing, 
and an unofficial ban on entertainment, alcoholic drinks and social functions. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the long period of preparation for Hirohito's death, the responses 
varied widely from company to company because it had been 62 years since the 
Japanese have had to so mark an end to an era. Many were unsure how to respond, 
and it was considered unseemly to plan for the death in any detail before it 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Are an American Corporation' 
</P>
<P>
"This has not happened in the lifetime of most of the Japanese in our bank," 
Margaret Merrett, a spokeswoman for Sanwa Bank California, said Friday. "The 
last time this occured before, they weren't born for the most part. So they 
don't remember. This is a new experience for them." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japan's pervasive role in the world economy gives the emperor's 
death a high visibility abroad -- a concern that Japan's U.S. subsidiaries 
downplayed by stressing that they are U.S. firms. Officials of Japanese banks 
and securities firms, U.S. arms of Japanese auto firms, and other Japanese 
outposts in this country said it would largely be business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
"We are an American corporation, we work on an American calendar and schedule," 
said Yutaka Nakai, general manager at the Los Angeles office of Daiwa 
Securities America. 
</P>
<P>
An exception: All Nippon Airways canceled the next three days of U.S. 
advertising, according to Kent Cooper, director of public relations at the Los 
Angeles office of Hokuhodo Advertising America. Hokuhodo is Japan's 
second-largest advertising agency. 
</P>
<P>
ANA, one of the most Japanese of Japan's airlines, also dusted off contingency 
plans that called for an end to in-flight movies for a week as well as the 
customary "welcome drink" for first-class and business-class customers, an 
airway spokesman said. And the chief steward was to exchange the usual orange 
uniform in favor of the more subdued blue outfit worn by the rest of the staff. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said the cancellation of ANA's domestic advertising -- compared to a 
planned seven-day suspension in Japan -- was implemented Friday under what was 
known internally as the "Hirohito Ad Suspension Plan." 
</P>
<P>
For the thousands of Americans who do business with Japanese or work for them, 
the death of the emperor raised issues of protocol that brought forth this 
advice Friday: American business people should direct their condolences to the 
consul general of Japan in Los Angeles, Hiromoto Seki. 
</P>
<P>
The consulate office at 250 E. First St., 12th floor, will receive condolences 
Monday through Thursday between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m., where visitors may sign a 
book of mourning. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Clemmon, executive director of the Japan America Society of Southern 
California, said the main focus for condolences should be toward Japanese 
government representatives, beginning with the Consulate General. But Merrett 
of Sanwa Bank said it would be appropriate for American business people to 
express regrets to Japanese business people in writing or in person. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing really set down as this is what you have to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, several major observances have been scheduled. For example, the Tokyo 
Stock Exchange's normal half-day Saturday trading session was canceled, and 
officials were discussing whether to close the exchange on Monday as well, said 
Ken Suzuki, general manager at the Los Angeles office of Nikko Securities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notified by Loudspeaker 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Hirohito's death occurred as the weekend began will tend to 
minimize the disruption to the nation's economic life, several executives said. 
Nissan and Toyota, the two biggest auto makers, planned full factory schedules 
even through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Employees arriving for work Saturday morning were notified at most companies by 
loudspeaker of the emperor's death, and were asked to lower the national flags 
to half-staff and observe one minute of meditation. At Toyota, the observance 
was scheduled for 10 a.m., a normal work break time, so that no factory 
production would be lost. 
</P>
<P>
Though the U.S. operations of Japanese firms were generally supposed to be 
unaffected, several companies said they will continue to observe a general ban 
on large parties and receptions. Some companies implemented the ban last 
September when Hirohito first became seriously ill. 
</P>
<P>
Merrett of Sanwa Bank said Sanwa will stay open as usual but will observe a 
50-day mourning period during which there will not be any large parties or 
receptions. Also, senior officers in Japan will not likely leave Japan to visit 
the United States during this period, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The general slowdown of official economic activity in Japan will mean less 
travel within Japan and abroad, several executives said. Tourism is also likely 
to be affected. However, no dramatic impact was predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Cotter, senior vice president of marketing for the Hawaii Visitors Bureau, 
said he thought the effect of reduced visits from Japanese tourists to his 
state "will be minimal." 
</P>
<P>
He said older Japanese tourists -- who were close spiritually to the emperor -- 
may postpone trips for a while. But the bulk of Japanese tourists are younger 
and less likely to change their plans significantly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, he contended, the mourning period may be shorter than the 
traditional 49 days, since government officials were asking people to show 
"restraint" only over the next four or five days.

Northwest Airlines said it will sharply reduce its biggest discount fares on 
some flights, cutting them up to $110 round-trip for travel completed by Feb. 
28. Northwest said the promotional fares center primarily on flights to and 
from 22 U.S. cities in the South and Southeast. The biggest reductions are for 
off-peak travel, with smaller discounts for peak periods and extra savings for 
senior citizens. Tickets must be purchased at least seven days before travel, 
passengers must stay over a Saturday night and the fares are not refundable. 
Other airlines are expected to follow suit.

MURDOCH TAKES OVER COLLINS FOR $721 MILLION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch emerged victorious Friday from a long-running 
takeover battle after Scottish publisher William Collins PLC accepted his offer 
valuing the company at $721 million (403 million pounds). 
</P>
<P>
The Glasgow-based firm, which numbers Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev among 
its authors and the Bible among its publications, is one of Britain's biggest 
independent publishing companies. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Ian Chapman, reversing his earlier opposition to the hostile bid, 
urged shareholders to accept the offer, which was made by British-based News 
International PLC, a unit of Murdoch's News Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The turnaround came after Murdoch boosted his 41.7% stake in Collins, acquired 
in 1981. Murdoch now owns a controlling 54%. Collins and Murdoch's News Corp. 
each own half of U.S. publisher Harper &amp; Row Publishers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch was pleased with the new addition to his global media empire. "We're 
very happy," he told British Broadcasting Corp. radio from Australia. "I 
thought it all needed pulling together more so everybody would have the benefit 
of a first-class worldwide company." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently to head off a revolt by several leading Collins authors concerned 
that Murdoch control would affect editorial policy, News International pledged 
that Collins' managers would retain autonomy over in-house policy. 
</P>
<P>
Travel writer Eric Newby, who had threatened to defect, said he would wait and 
see if this proved to be the case. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1987, Murdoch paid $300 million for Harper &amp; Row, an educational 
book specialist with a long history of distribution agreements with Collins. 
</P>
<P>
A few months later Collins bought a 50% stake in the U.S. publisher, in a move 
designed to give it a foothold in the United States. The two companies have 
published many authors in common, and Harper has handled distribution for 
Collins' best-selling "A Day in the Life of America."

Ethigen Corp. said it renamed its AL-721 food supplement Altrigen in an effort 
"to end confusion created by bootleggers" selling purportedly similar egg 
lecithin products. AL-721 and its imitators are widely used by AIDS patients 
and others infected with the human immunodeficiency virus in the hope of 
slowing disease progression. Ethigen sells the product over the counter in 
selected pharmacies; the imitation products are sold through health-food stores 
and buyers' clubs that have sprung up in the wake of the epidemic. Many AIDS 
experts are skeptical that the products work.

JAPANESE BANKS SAID TO BE CLOSE TO FUNDING RJR DEAL 
</P>

Trading in RJR Nabisco Inc. was hectic Friday as investors scrambled for shares 
on a news report that 10 Japanese banks were about to lend Kohlberg Kravis 
Roberts &amp; Co. $5.15 billion to help pay for the food and tobacco firm. 
</P>
<P>
The stock topped the most actives on the New York Stock Exchange, rising $1.50 
to $93.125 on top of Thursday's $1 advance. The price still remains below the 
$109-a-share bid in cash and securities offered by KKR. Almost 4.5 million 
shares were traded by late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. banks are also expected to furnish lending for the leveraged buyout of 
RJR, which is the most expensive takeover in U.S. corporate history. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's Kyodo News Service, quoting unidentified sources in the financial 
industry, reported that the biggest banking names in Japan were lining up to 
help finance the $25-billion takeover. Some $13.7 billion of the purchase price 
is needed from banks. 
</P>
<P>
Some banks have been cautious about committing to KKR because of the large size 
of the loans and possible Congressional action to tighten rules on leveraged 
buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
The deadline for deciding on participation is Jan. 18, but banks can commit as 
early as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the concerns, a majority of banks are expected to support the deal 
because of the attractive terms, Kyodo said. KKR is offering an interest rate 
about 2.5 percentage points above the London interbank offered rate, which is 
the global version of the U.S. prime. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-month offered rate Friday was quoted at 9.43%. With the premium, KKR 
would be paying nearly 12%, which is considered an appropriate rate for 
speculative, or "junk bond" financing. The U.S. prime is currently at 10.5%. 
</P>
<P>
KKR has been so eager to have Japanese banks chip in that KKR partner Henry 
Kravis met representatives of Japanese banks in Tokyo last month. 
</P>
<P>
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., Fuji Bank Ltd., Sanwa Bank Ltd. and Long-Term Credit 
Bank of Japan plan to lend $600 million each, Kyodo quoted sources as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., Sumitomo Bank Ltd., Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. and 
Nippon Credit Bank Ltd. will each lend $500 million, the Kyodo report said. 
Tokai Bank Ltd. will lend $400 million and Mitsui Trust &amp; Banking Co. Ltd. 
$350 million, Kyodo said.

FOUNTAIN VALLEY SCRAMBLES TO GET LEAD, KEEPS SCRAMBLING TO DEFEAT OCEAN VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Having started the fourth quarter 5 points behind, it figured that once 
Fountain Valley High School got a lead on highly touted Ocean View -- ranked 
No. 4 in Orange County -- it would finally take a deep breath and slow down. 
Who knows, maybe even hold the ball for 10 seconds or so. 
</P>
<P>
But Fountain Valley just kept shooting on the way to a 73-69 victory in the 
Sunset League opener for both schools in front of 1,500 at Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We were on a good run and I figured why mess with it," said Dave Brown, 
Fountain Valley coach. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley's run started 40 seconds into the fourth quarter with Tim 
Hellbusch's 15-foot jump shot, which cut Ocean View's lead to 58-55. It ended 
with a second to go as Mike Cook's free throw gave Fountain Valley a 73-69 lead 
and took away any possibility of a 3-point shot coming to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley, which took a 59-58 lead lead on Hellbusch's tip-in with 5:45 
remaining, never pulled the ball out to run time off the clock even when it 
went ahead 64-58 with 4:18 left. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a 3-point shooting team," Brown said. "We have to play our way." 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley did make 5 3-point shots in the game, though none in the fourth 
quarter. In the fourth quarter it simply pushed the ball upcourt then shot it. 
That set off a frenzy of activity in the game's last 4 minutes, when the teams 
combined for 22 points, 3 blocked shots, 4 turnovers, 2 steals and a couple of 
offensive fouls. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a great high school game," Brown said. "The people got their money's 
worth." 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley (13-2, 1-0) outscored Ocean View, 20-11, in the fourth quarter. 
Ocean View didn't score its first points of that quarter until 4:05 remained. 
</P>
<P>
That came on Darren Ernst's layup, but Ocean View (10-4, 0-1) still found 
itself trailing, 64-60. Ocean View's troubles scoring in the fourth quarter 
were out of character for a team that had scored 22 points in the second 
quarter -- to take a 34-33 halftime lead -- and 24 points in the third quarter 
to take a 58-53 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View trailed, 15-12, after the first quarter but started pushing the ball 
inside and getting fouled in the second quarter. Ocean View outscored Fountain 
Valley, 22-18 in the second, 15 of Ocean View's points coming on free throws. 
Guard Mike Frohn, who finished with 18, had 10 points in the quarter, all on 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"We were letting them get the ball in too deep, and then we were trying to 
reach in and take it away," said Mike Merle, Fountain Valley forward. 
</P>
<P>
Merle, who led Fountain Valley with 19 points, had 6 in the fourth quarter. He 
would have had 8, but he was called for an offensive foul on a driving layup 
with 1:31 left, and his team leading, 68-66. 
</P>
<P>
On the exchange, Ocean View's Ernst seemed ready to tie the score with a layup, 
but Fountain Valley's Tom Weaver, a 6-foot 1-inch guard, blocked the shot. 
Fountain Valley's Derrick Corcoran made 2 free throws to put his team up, 
70-66, with 52 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Edison 47, Huntington Beach 46 -- Bryan Murphy made an 8-foot jump shot with 40 
seconds left to give Edison (8-9, 1-0) a 47-46 lead. Huntington Beach worked 
for the last shot, but Jeff Long missed an 8-foot jumper with 8 seconds left. 
Murphy scored 17 points and Bill Martineau 11 for the Chargers. Long scored 14 
points for the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
Marina 68, Westminster 41 -- Sophomore forward Cherokee Parks scored 20 points 
to lead Marina at Westminster. Marina led, 19-8, at the end of the first 
quarter and, 32-13, at the half.

JALEWALIA SCORES 45 POINTS AS LA QUINTA WINS EASILY AGAIN

The La Quinta High School girls' basketball team swept past its second big 
Garden Grove League rival this week with a 66-28 victory over Kennedy on Friday 
at Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta had beaten Rancho Alamitos, the other challenger for the league 
championship, 67-48, Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
And for that the Aztecs can thank Amy Jalewalia, their 6-foot 1-inch 
do-everything junior. 
</P>
<P>
Jalewalia, who primarily plays center but occasionally plays guard and forward, 
had 45 points, 21 rebounds and 14 steals against Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
She was only 3 points short of tying the school record of 48 points she set 
against El Modena earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday against Rancho Alamitos, Jalewalia scored a game-high 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night again provided Jalewalia ample opportunity to show off her 
considerable athletic skills. She showed a soft touch on her outside shots, 
making long jumpers. She also worked free for easy shots close in. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, though, she led the way on the Aztecs' swarming full-court press. 
And that led to a number of easy layups for her and teammate Tanya Krill, who 
had 14 points and 9 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect 20 to 30 points out of (Jalewalia), but not 40," said Kevin Kiernan, 
La Quinta coach. Jalewalia came into the game averaging 26.5 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
"All we really wanted this week was a split," Kiernan said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, La Quinta improved its record to 9-3 overall and 2-0 in league play. 
Kennedy is 2-6, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta let Kennedy stay close for a few moments early in the game but broke 
the game open with a 19-2 run that gave the Aztecs a 25-6 lead with 4:54 left 
in the half. 
</P>
<P>
By halftime, La Quinta a 35-14 lead and Jalewalia had 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Ruiz had 10 points for Kennedy. ELLIOTT TEAFORD In another Garden Grove 
League game: Los Amigos 48, Pacifica 25 -- Amy Pearson scored 13 points and 
Carrie Elsaesser 12 to lead Los Amigos (4-6, 2-0) at Pacifica. In the Express 
League: Gathsemane Baptist 36, Claremont 22 -- Tamik Harold scored 16 points to 
lead Gathsemane Baptist (3-1) at the Huntington Beach Boys' Club. Hope Norris 
scored 13 points for Claremont (2-5, 1-2). In nonleague games: Savanna 74, 
Sunny Hills 31 -- Pam Dykema scored 18 points to lead host Savanna (10-4). 
Christina Radu, Lisa Rios, Jackie Boxly and Kareena Leach scored 10 points 
Savanna. University 50, Woodbridge 44 -- Shelley Davis had 16 points and 8 
rebounds to lead the Trojans (11-3) at Woodbridge. Leslie Rathman scored 20 
points for Woodbridge (9-5).

COUNTY'S PORTRAIT IS PAINTED BY NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONN JOHNSTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the Earth rotated Orange County to a new Friday, already the first of 
200,000 pounds of eggs were sizzling and 276,000 pints of orange juice were 
being poured in some of the county's 829,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the 2.3 million people here, the sunrise came in their sleep. But 
soon, Orange County alarm clocks jangled and telephones rang, and Orange County 
mouths would be on their way to swallowing 7 million pounds of food and 
guzzling 800,000 gallons of various beverages. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's the statistical county portrait rendered by the Fullerton 
Museum Center's exhibit opening today at 301 N. Pomona Ave. The first of three 
parts of "Document: Orange County 1989" explores the county's environment, 
economy and natural resources through clever graphics, photographs and videos. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to present an overall picture of contemporary physical and 
cultural Orange County through visuals," said Naida Osline, project curator. 
"We wanted to try and personalize and individualize statistics." 
</P>
<P>
Parts two and three will focus on the people of Orange County and their future. 
The show is based on research gathered by Tim Campbell -- administrator of the 
Fullerton Museum -- from more than 70 private industries and public agencies 
since last spring. The show closes July 30. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's effort is among the many affiliated this year with Orange County's 
official centennial celebration, said Joe Felz, museum center director. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibits, housed on 2,600 square feet of museum floor space, offer a most 
unusual look at that familiar creature, the Orange County animal in his 
habitat. 
</P>
<P>
On any given Orange County day -- say Friday, also the 12th day of Christmas -- 
many early risers dawdled under a hot shower. About 40 gallons of H2O went down 
the drain for those 10-minute showers, adding to the day's total pool of waste 
water of 250 million gallons, enough to fill Anaheim Stadium to the rim. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County throats were cleared, toothpaste tubes squeezed, doors slammed 
and coffee chugged -- on average, two cups per person. In keeping with 
tradition, most men pulled on their trousers one leg at a time. 
</P>
<P>
The booming Orange County economy was already bracing itself for another day, 
looking for a piece of its annual $21.3 billion in taxable sales. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth of the million people here in the civilian labor force were thinking 
about their jobs in the wholesale and retail trade. Another fourth contemplated 
their careers in the service industry. Only 5% -- those in the construction 
industry -- were worrying about building anything. 
</P>
<P>
The county's two major mineral resources to be exploited that day were oil and 
aggregate rock for concrete. 
</P>
<P>
But most workers, perhaps, had their minds on the morning commute, especially 
the 26 new drivers entering Orange County's roads Friday. It would have been a 
discouraging thing to remind them that there were 1.16 vehicles for each of the 
county's residents. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the 1.9 million cars registered here would stretch for 4,999 miles if 
parked end to end. 
</P>
<P>
Only 2% of those hustling to work were sufficiently daunted by the ordeal to 
take public transportation. Most of those took the bus. An extraordinary 0.003% 
claimed to ride the subway to work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2.6% Walk to Work 
</P>
<P>
A healthier 2.6% of all commuters walked to their jobs. But three-quarters of 
those out there on the county's 5,572 miles of public roads were alone in their 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 cars an hour passed through the intersection at Beach Boulevard and 
Edinger Avenue, the county's busiest. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular new car stuck in traffic that morning was the Honda Accord, 
sales of which contributed to the more than $2.5 billion raked in by new-car 
dealers here each year. 
</P>
<P>
But if that Honda was headed for one of the year's more than 3,400 accidents, 
its driver was more likely to have been speeding, turning or yielding unsafely 
than to have been drunk, the cause for 12% of accidents here. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the less affluent commuters were among the 50% of the county population 
who earn less than $43,264 a year. And many of them doubted that they could 
come up with a down payment for the median home, price tag $225,000. A few 
women wondered why they earned only 67 cents for every dollar paid their male 
colleagues doing a comparable job. 
</P>
<P>
More affluent commuters may have planned to stop on their way home from work at 
various regional shopping malls, department stores and boutiques that in all 
occupy 0.3% of the county's 511,437 total acres. Vacant land took up the most 
county space, followed next by single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
If all county land had been divided equally among residents that morning, each 
would receive 10,000 square feet.

THIEVES CAN'T STEAL LIFE OUT OF SCIENCE CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIMBERLY L. JACKSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seventh-graders at Rancho San Joaquin Intermediate School have been fascinated 
by life science instructor Bill W. Anderson's "teaching tools" -- animals of 
all kinds, including a 15-foot python, caged cockateels, wild deer mice, exotic 
fish and more in two rooms used to expose his pupils to wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
But in one corner, next to a wall covered with clippings from science 
magazines, a glass aquarium marked "Haitian Boa" sits empty. The two specimens 
that had lived there were among $2,200 worth of reptiles stolen from the Irvine 
classroom earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
"They took some really unusual king snakes that you can't legally buy in 
California," Anderson said. An albino corn snake and a western hognose snake 
also were among the 23 snakes, 3 turtles and 2 lizards stolen Tuesday, he said. 
Only about 15 of the reptiles remain. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Police Lt. Pat Rodgers said the suspects pried the classroom door open 
with a blunt object sometime between midnight and 8 a.m. Tuesday. Officers were 
unable to find any usable fingerprints Tuesday, but they are still 
investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said he had bought many of the missing reptiles with his own money. 
Others he had found under rocks while on trips or morning runs. He added that 
he spends much of his free time collecting and caring for the animals that 
bring "life" to his science classes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what I love, and I put 100% into what I do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the elaborate exhibit, he said, is that most of his students, 
about age 12, aren't really interested in "the booky stuff." But if they can be 
made interested by looking at the actual creatures, "that's when they'll read," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's approach seems to work. On Friday, students were planning a "snake 
dance" and a candy sale to replace some of the stolen animals, school officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
During class Friday, Anderson lifted one of the remaining snakes, a 15-foot 
python, from its temporary home -- a green garbage pail, for about 35 wide-eyed 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look inside his mouth," he said, holding the snake by its neck, "you'll 
see a little hole. That's his breathing tube." 
</P>
<P>
"Hey Mr. Anderson," one pupil called out. "What does that guy eat?" 
</P>
<P>
Rabbits and chickens and such, Anderson responded. But watching the reptiles 
eat is an experience he reserves for his advanced students. "A lot of the kids 
couldn't handle it," he explained.

FUENTES WILL ASK 3RD TERM DESPITE FUROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the controversy over his role in posting uniformed security guards at 
Santa Ana polling places last November, Thomas A. Fuentes says he will seek a 
third term on Monday as chairman of the Orange County Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes, citing Republican voter-registration gains in the county, contends 
that he has strengthened the party locally during his 4 years as boss of the 
party's county operation. Fuentes, 39, is expected to be unopposed when the 
66-member county Republican Central Committee meets Monday to select new 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
A hard-working, aggressive political operative, Fuentes is a central figure in 
the uproar over the party's use of uniformed security guards in the November 
general election to warn non-citizens not to vote. Fuentes acknowledged that he 
authorized payment of about $4,000 for the guards, who were stationed at 20 
polling places in heavily Latino precincts in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders have said that the guards were hired to ensure against voter 
fraud because of anonymous tips that illegally registered voters were to be 
bused to the polls in the 72nd Assembly District. The use of the guards 
prompted Democrats to file a federal lawsuit seeking to overturn the outcome of 
the election in that district, where Republican Curt Pringle defeated Democrat 
Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach by fewer than 900 of the more than 66,000 votes 
cast. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes said the only protest over the county party's role in the guard's 
hiring has come from Democrats or the press. He said Republican officeholders 
and activists "have encouraged me to seek the chairmanship of the party again." 
</P>
<P>
In support of his candidacy, Fuentes suggested that 1988 was the most 
successful year ever for county Republicans. After a major push last year, 
Republicans have a voter-registration lead of 240,000 over Democrats. Fuentes 
also pointed to President-elect Bush's 314,000-vote margin of victory in the 
county over Democrat Michael Dukakis. It was the largest such margin of any 
county in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The GOP Central Committee is scheduled to meet at 7:30 p.m. Monday at the 
Westin South Coast Plaza hotel in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
County Democrats are also scheduled to choose a new party leader Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Michael G. Balmages of Santa Ana is running against former local party 
Vice Chairman Hazel Stover of Orange. The current chairman, attorney John Hanna 
of Santa Ana, is not seeking reelection.

$1-MILLION 'PROJECT CATALYST' AIMS TO FOSTER BETTER SCIENCE EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

With $1 million in federal and private donations, Cal State Fullerton this 
month launches a 2 1/2-year program to help junior- and senior-high school 
instructors improve teaching of Earth and space sciences. 
</P>
<P>
"High school and junior high science teachers face many problems, including 
working with outdated materials," said Carol Stadum, one of the program's two 
directors. "We're designing a program that can help these teachers, and it's a 
program that can go anywhere in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
Stadum is an award-winning Huntington Beach High School science teacher on loan 
to Cal State Fullerton as a visiting lecturer. The other project director is 
Gaylen R. Carlson, a geological sciences professor at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a matter of making 'bad' teachers into 'good' teachers," Carlson 
said. "This is an enhancement process. We're enhancing teachers' ability to 
teach (science) in the classroom. . . . We're going to improve their capability 
and make them better in the classroom. We're going to give them a boost -- kind 
of a shot in the arm." 
</P>
<P>
The program, called Project Catalyst, is designed to be a national model for 
updating public-school science teachers and helping those newly assigned to 
science teaching. The National Science Foundation gave $558,000 to the training 
project, and private businesses and school districts in Southern California 
have pledged an additional $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton received about 120 applications from teachers hoping to 
take part in the program. The university picked 52 applicants, trying to select 
from a wide cross section of teachers and school districts, Carlson said. The 
52 are primarily from Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers are scheduled to get intensive training in astronomy, geology, 
meteorology and oceanography. They will take part in 14 all-day workshops, two 
summer institutes and several symposiums and field trips over the next 2 1/2 
years, beginning Jan. 14. 
</P>
<P>
The school districts with participating teachers have agreed to pay for their 
release time from school. "This in itself amounts to a sizeable amount of 
money," Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the program developed after Stadum was invited to be a visiting 
lecturer at Cal State Fullerton "because of her impressive background," Carlson 
said. Stadum, who has taught at Huntington Beach High since 1973, in 1986 was 
one of three California finalists in the National Science Foundation 
Presidential Awards program. In 1974 she almost single-handledly led a 
successful fight to save a 15-million-year-old fossil reef that had been 
threatened by developers in the Laguna Hills area. The area is now a public 
preserve, Fossil Reef Park, near Laguna Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
At the university, the chairman of the geological sciences department asked 
Stadum to develop a grant proposal. She and Carlson, working together, "went 
out and talked to industries and school districts and got them committed to 
this project," Carlson said. "The National Science Foundation wanted us to be 
able to show matching contributions, including in-kind donations, before it 
would make a grant. 
</P>
<P>
Carlson said the program ultimately can help the United States get more and 
better-qualified science teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a first-rate nation, and we should have first-rate (science) teachers," 
he said. "The evidence suggests that the United States is not doing a very good 
job in science instruction in the schools. The East Germans, the Japanese, the 
French, the British, are ahead of us in international (science) test scores." 
</P>
<P>
Stadum said the California Board of Education in 1984 enacted regulations for 
expanded science teaching in the public schools. But she said a drawback has 
been a shortage of science teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have fewer trained scientists going into science education," she said. "So 
some schools have had to pull in teachers from other disciplines to teach 
science. . . . Also, there are some very good existing science teachers, but 
some of them are teaching from their knowledge of 20 years ago, of science in 
the 1950s. One of the components of our program is technology in the classroom; 
we'll be giving the teachers instruction for science application in their 
classrooms." 
</P>
<P>
About a fourth of the teachers enrolled in the program have agreed to conduct 
similar workshops at their own schools when they complete the course, Carlson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Carol and I think this grant will thus reach about 400 other teachers through 
this multiplier effect," he said.

MOVIE ON NORTH TO BE FILMED NEAR RARE BIRD SITE AT PRADO DAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A television movie about the career of Iran-Contra scandal figure Lt. Col. 
Oliver L. North will be filmed later this month on Orange County Water District 
property that is home to an endangered species of small gray songbirds. 
</P>
<P>
Scenes from the 4-hour miniseries, "Guts and Glory: The Rise and Fall of Oliver 
North," will be filmed on jungle-like land behind the Prado Dam in Riverside 
County. The filming site is not far from the nesting grounds of the least 
Bell's vireo, but a federal wildlife biologist said his office has been assured 
that the movie crews will not harm the bird's habitat. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, much of the footage will be shot near a pheasant-hunting area, in a 
section of property where war games -- in which paint pellets are shot -- are 
played. Also in the area is an "obnoxious weed" that is not "associated with a 
whole lot of wildlife value," said Dick Zembal, a biologist with the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
Zembal said the federal agency is satisfied that the filming is far enough away 
from the nesting grounds of the vireo, a small bird that migrates south in the 
winter but returns to the Prado Dam basin in March to nest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Was Nearly Extinct 
</P>
<P>
The bird depends on a structurally diverse stream-bed environment, Zembal said. 
Once a common bird, it was practically extinct several years ago after land 
development eliminated much of its environment. Through programs to protect the 
bird, the population of the vireo is slowing gaining in the Prado Dam basin, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The area will be the site for movie scenes that are supposed to have taken 
place in San Salvador, Vietnam, Okinawa and Camp Lejeune, N.C., said Ricky 
Frazier, location manager for Papazian-Hirsch Production Inc. of Los Angeles, 
which is making the movie. 
</P>
<P>
The area was chosen for the film because "it has a numerous amount of looks," 
Frazier said. "It's an attractive place to film. We're able to do it all in one 
place in 3 days. Otherwise we might have been going to Puerto Rico and Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
The crews will film Jan. 16, 17 and 18, he said. The movie, tracing the career 
of North from his days as a midshipman at Annapolis until the Iran-Contra 
affair, will be shown on CBS on a yet-to-be-decided date. 
</P>
<P>
The movie will be neutral on the issue of whether North -- to be played by 
actor David Keith -- is a hero or a criminal, Frazier said. 
</P>
<P>
"You bet it is. The audience will have to make up their minds on that," he 
said. "We're not putting him on trial here." 
</P>
<P>
North, a former official on the National Security Agency staff, has been 
charged with making false statements to Congress, obstructing justice by 
shredding White House documents, participating in a tax fraud conspiracy 
involving private fund raising for the Nicaraguan Contras and illegally 
accepting installation of a $13,800 security fence outside his home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agency Gave Permission 
</P>
<P>
Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh moved Thursday to drop two central 
charges of conspiracy and theft in selling U.S. Army weapons to Iran at a 
profit, and then secretly diverting the funds to the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier said he discovered the area for filming while he was pheasant hunting 
there. 
</P>
<P>
In arranging to film there, he learned of the nesting grounds of the least 
Bell's vireo. "We took great pains to work with the guy who leases the 
property, to make sure we weren't going to be in any of its nesting areas or 
habitat," Frazier said. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Elser, director of public affairs for the Orange County Water District, 
said the agency granted permission to the film crew and will be on hand during 
the shooting to make sure the nesting grounds are protected. (Zembal said 
representatives of the federal wildlife agency may also show up, but more out 
of curiosity than concern.) 
</P>
<P>
Elser said the water district is spending thousands of dollars studying how the 
birds would be affected if the dam's water storage is increased as part of 
proposed flood control improvements to the Santa Ana River. Ultimately, the 
agency could be responsible for replacing their habitat at a huge cost. 
</P>
<P>
With all that at stake, he said, there is no way the district will allow a film 
crew to ruin the birds' habitat. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to blow it on this," Elser said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal wildlife biologist Zembal said the agency has been assured the least 
Bell vireo's habitat will be safe. The bird is not even in the area now, 
although care must be taken that its environment is not damaged, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like they (the production company) did their homework, and so did 
the water district," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest threat to the least Bell's vireo, Zembal said, comes not from the 
film crew but from another bird, the brown-headed cowbird, an abundant "nest 
parasite" that lays its eggs in the nests of other birds. 
</P>
<P>
When a cowbird uses the nests of vireos, it often removes eggs or pecks the 
host eggs open. The baby cowbird "is very aggressive and will kick the host 
babies out of the nest" if eggs from both birds hatch at the same time, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The population of least Bell's vireos is believed to be about 300 pairs in 
California, according to the state Department of Fish and Game's 1987 annual 
report on endangered and threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
In the Prado Dam basin, 25 territorial male least Bell's vireos were counted in 
1983. By 1986, they were down to 19. At that time, a 3-year program, funded by 
Caltrans as part of the project to build a bridge on Interstate 15, was begun 
to help protect the birds. In 1987, 26 male birds were counted, and last year 
-- the final year of the Caltrans program -- 37 males, representing probably 30 
nesting pairs, were found. In addition, many fledglings were observed, "so next 
year probably will be significantly larger," Zembal said. 
</P>
<P>
The program, run by Cal State Long Beach, will continue with funding from the 
Orange County Water District, Zembal said. Elser estimated the cost at $35,000 
a year.

STATE PANEL SAYS PEGGY BUCKEY CAN RESUME TEACHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peggy Ann Buckey, who lost her teaching credential after she was indicted in 
the McMartin Pre-School molestation case, on Friday won her fight for the right 
to return to the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
The state Commission on Teacher Credentialing, meeting in Sacramento, voted 7 
to 6, with one abstention, to endorse a proposed ruling by an administrative 
law judge, released Thursday. The judge approved Buckey's application to teach 
the deaf and learning-disabled. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's endorsement becomes effective 30 days after Buckey, 32, and 
her lawyer, John Wagner, are officially notified of the action. When she 
receives her certificate, Buckey said she will ask the Anaheim Union High 
School District to reinstate her. 
</P>
<P>
"I anticipate they will do their duty," Wagner said Friday. "She had tenure, 
and she has a right to go back. If they do not, then I will go to court. She's 
entitled to a great deal of back pay. I estimate that it will be more than 
$100,000. On March 4, she will have been out 5 years." 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, reached at her home late Friday, contended that she had never 
officially lost her teaching job. She said that she has been on suspension for 
the past 5 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have a job there," Buckey said. 
</P>
<P>
The school district's attorney, Lee Kellogg, said after Friday's vote that 
there has been "no thought" about Buckey's future, and there will be no 
discussion until an official notice of the commission decision is received. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, meanwhile, expressed elation at the news that she would regain her 
teaching credential. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm overjoyed," she said. "I think it's the greatest news I've had in 5 years. 
I really wasn't surprised. With this case, I gave up a long time ago trying to 
predict what would happen." 
</P>
<P>
Buckey and seven other McMartin teachers were indicted on child-molestation 
charges in March, 1984. She was suspended pending a resolution of the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
When the charges against her were dropped about 18 months later, however, 
school officials denied Buckey's request for reinstatement, questioning both 
her "moral fitness" to teach and whether, in fact, she still had a credential, 
which they contended had expired. 
</P>
<P>
After failing to get her classroom job back in 1986, Buckey applied to state 
officials for a credential and was denied. After filing suit, she won a hearing 
before Administrative Law Judge Ronald M. Gruen. The hearing lasted nearly 3 
months in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In many respects, the proceeding that wound up in November was a mini-version 
of the 5-year-old McMartin molestation case, in which Peggy Ann's brother, 
Raymond Buckey, 30, and mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 61, face 65 counts of 
molestation and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
More than three dozen witnesses testified about reports of child molestation at 
the now-closed McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach. Peggy Ann Buckey was 
accused of molesting four former McMartin pupils, who testified behind closed 
doors, and killing animals as a warning to them not to tell their parents. 
</P>
<P>
Gruen was sharply critical of testimony offered by the state to connect Buckey 
with the charges, particularly a "pervasive use of leading and suggestive 
questions" in taped interviews of children who supposedly were victims of 
molestation.

Paltex Editing &amp; Production Systems Ltd. in London has completed its 
purchase of the video editing division of EECO Inc. in Santa Ana for $375,000 
and a promissory note for an unspecified amount. All 22 employees who worked in 
EECO's video editing division reported for work Tuesday at Paltex's U.S. 
subsidiary, California Paltex Corp. in Tustin. The sale, completed Dec. 30, 
makes Paltex the biggest independent manufacturer of video and audio editing 
systems, which are used in the communications industry. The sale also rids EECO 
of one of its two unprofitable divisions. EECO's other unprofitable division, 
which is expected to be sold within 3 months, makes computers that manage the 
operations and billings of hotels. EECO is concentrating on its original line 
of work -- electronic switches and keyboards for computers.

PRIME COMPUTER'S STOCK SOARS ON BELIEF THAT MAI BASIC FOUR WILL ACQUIRE FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Computer's stock price soared to a 52-week high Friday, fueled in part by 
a growing conviction among investors that MAI Basic Four of Tustin will prevail 
in its hostile takeover bid for the Massachusetts computer maker. 
</P>
<P>
Prime closed Friday at $19.125 a share, up 50 cents for the day, on a volume of 
nearly 1.3 million shares in New York Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
Prime's stock was trading at less than $17 per share when MAI launched its 
$970-million tender offer Nov. 15. Until Wednesday, the price had hovered 
around $17.50, leading analysts to speculate that investors were not convinced 
MAI could make the deal work. 
</P>
<P>
MAI is blocked by a federal court preliminary injunction from acquiring any of 
the Prime shares tendered to it by stockholders. And Prime has continued its 
strident opposition to MAI's acquisition offer. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter released to the press Friday, Prime Chairman David L. Dunn called 
for MAI to withdraw its offer, which Dunn characterized as "highly conditioned, 
extremely leveraged, unfinanced and inadequate." Dunn also questioned the 
motives and integrity of MAI Chairman Bennett S. LeBow; those of his investing 
partner, William Weksel, and of the investment banking firm of Drexel Burnham 
Lambert, which has agreed to raise at least $875 million to help MAI fund the 
takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn, who was responding to a letter from LeBow, said Prime is reluctant to 
provide MAI with confidential financial information in light of the fact that 
Drexel has made a tentative agreement to plead guilty to felony securities 
fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn also cited a previous consent decree signed by Weksel to settle 
allegations that Weksel made material misstatements of the financial condition 
and operating results of a company Weksel and LeBow controlled. 
</P>
<P>
"You yourself are the subject of several private lawsuits relating to . . . the 
violations of law which were part of the SEC's complaint against Mr. Weksel," 
Dunn wrote to LeBow. "Accordingly, we are skeptical that Drexel, Weksel and 
yourself would treat Prime and its stockholders any better than you have 
treated your customers and/or stockholders in previous situations." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for LeBow said the New York financier would not comment on Dunn's 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
In a Jan. 4 letter to Dunn -- which MAI released to the press Thursday -- LeBow 
charged that Prime's opposition to the MAI acquisition offer is robbing Prime 
shareholders of millions of dollars in potential profits that are being spent 
instead for legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Prime and MAI are suing each other in federal court in Massachusetts over the 
acquisition bid, and MAI is suing Prime in state court in Delaware in an 
attempt to overturn various Prime anti-takeover measures. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the appearance of the rhetoric from both sides, several industry 
analysts said Friday that they believe MAI ultimately will prevail and acquire 
Prime. 
</P>
<P>
John Logan, a Boston analyst who has been following Prime for years, said he 
believes it is likely that although Prime's public opposition to MAI is 
strident, the discussions about the offer being conducted privately among Prime 
directors and officers are probably more civil. 
</P>
<P>
LeBow's letter was basically a rehashing of MAI's original offer and, analysts 
suggested, merely an attempt to keep its bid visible to the investment 
community while the matter is being held up in court. 
</P>
<P>
In it, he said that if Prime dropped its opposition and the two companies were 
able to negotiate "a friendly transaction, substantially reduced financing 
costs might result. . . . We would prefer to share these potential benefits 
with your stockholders rather than pay them over to professional advisers and 
financial institutions." 
</P>
<P>
Employees, customers and suppliers of both companies "will benefit from a 
rapid, negotiated conclusion to the combination of Prime and MAI Basic Four, 
and the many millions of dollars not wasted on fighting a takeover battle could 
instead benefit our respective stockholders," LeBow wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the pending court battle, MAI has extended the expiration date of 
its tender offer to Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50% of Prime's shares had been offered to MAI by the end of December. 
In his letter to Dunn, LeBow said that means that Prime shareholders have 
"clearly communicated their desire to accept our offer by tendering their 
shares." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fear and Greed' 
</P>
<P>
Logan, who is vice president of the Aberdeen Group, a Boston market research 
firm, said that holders of Prime stock "are now in the grip of fear and greed . 
. . $20 a share is more than they hoped to see for years to come because Prime 
is losing market share in all of its major markets." 
</P>
<P>
But, Logan said, "there is also fear that their stock will be tied up if they 
tender and that LeBow will back out and they won't get the $20." 
</P>
<P>
MAI President William B. Patton Jr., however, scoffed at speculation that MAI 
has any intention of backing off. 
</P>
<P>
"We have always felt that this will go through, and we are completely confident 
that it will and are pleased that analysts now are saying it will," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Armbruster, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. in New York, said that 
Prime's rising stock price is a clear sign that investors, especially risk 
arbitragers, are convinced that MAI will be able to complete the acquisition. 
(Arbitragers specialize in identifying takeover targets and acquiring their 
shares while the price is still low, profiting as it climbs.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Analyst Expresses Optimism 
</P>
<P>
Armbruster said that he has been following the Massachusetts and Delaware court 
cases involving MAI and Prime and believes MAI will achieve its goals in each. 
</P>
<P>
Although the judge in Delaware rejected MAI's bid to overturn Prime's 
anti-takeover defenses, Armbruster said, "he also stated that if this were only 
obstacle to the transaction, then he would remove it." 
</P>
<P>
The issues in the federal case in Massachusetts, he said, have to do with the 
adequacy of financial disclosures by MAI. "Disclosure problems are relatively 
simple to remedy," Armbruster said. "All MAI needs to do is to make amended 
filings with the judge" until the judge is satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
The other concern voiced by U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone in 
Massachusetts is whether Drexel can market the bonds needed to obtain the $875 
million in financing it has promised to raise for MAI. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel recently agreed to pay a $650-million fine as part of its tentative 
settlement of securities fraud charges, and Mazzone said he wanted assurances 
that Drexel is financially sound. 
</P>
<P>
Armbruster said that with Drexel's becoming increasingly visible in the 
MAI-Prime fight, "their reputation is on line and they cannot fail. So it is 
safe to assume that Drexel will come up with the financing." 
</P>
<P>
Drexel officials could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Logan suggested that Drexel's role in any deal might not be as certain as 
Armbruster seems to believe. 
</P>
<P>
Prime's profits have been shrinking along with its market share over the past 2 
years, he said, and his firm believes that Prime will "have a horrible fourth 
quarter" and might even post a loss. 
</P>
<P>
If the financial picture is grim enough, Logan said, Drexel might not be able 
to convince potential bond purchasers that there is sufficient cash flow in the 
company to pay off the debt. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter, Prime Chairman David L. Dunn, left, called for MAI to withdraw its 
offer, which Dunn characterized as "highly conditioned, extremely leveraged, 
unfinanced and inadequate." He also questioned the motives and integrity of MAI 
Chairman Bennett S. LeBow, right; LeBow's investing partner, William Weksel, 
and the investment banking firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert, which has agreed to 
raise at least $875 million to help MAI fund the takeover.

"I feel like we're a prime piece of meat floating in the ocean and there are 
sharks all around," Pallas said. "A lot of people are rooting for us, but a lot 
of manipulative people are trying to take us down for greed." 
</P>
<P>
And notwithstanding the latest spate of lawsuits, Pallas contends that Heidi's 
"is turning the corner." 
</P>
<P>
The legal actions seek repayment of overdue taxes, back rent and overdue debts. 
</P>
<P>
The county treasurer's office, for example, filed a delinquency notice late 
last month for two bills totaling $234.53. 
</P>
<P>
The landlord of Heidi's corporate offices, Metropolitan Life Insurance, has 
sued the yogurt chain for 6 weeks of back rent. Carlsberg Resources Corp. has 
filed a case against Heidi's for unpaid rent on warehouse space in Costa Mesa. 
And Marilyn Wallar of Irvine has sued a Heidi's subsidiary and company 
executives Heidi A. Miller and Pallas for more than $32,000 allegedly due on 
two loans. 
</P>
<P>
According to Pallas, however, the lawsuits are "negotiating tactics" brought by 
creditors who are worried about losing their money. "I'm negotiating with 
creditors . . . (but) everybody's pulling the trigger," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pallas said he believes that the county treasurer's bill has been paid. 
Metropolitan Life, he said, has been told that Heidi's is considering a move to 
smaller headquarters as "part of working out a business plan." While he doesn't 
deny that the money is owed, he views the lawsuit as "a negotiating tactic." 
</P>
<P>
Carlsberg Resources "wants us out" because the lease for warehouse space is 
undervalued, Pallas said. And Wallar, who did advertising work for Heidi's, is 
still owed about $32,000 but already has been paid most of what she charged for 
her services, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a known fact that we're undercapitalized," Pallas said. But "we're not 
the only ones who are beleaguered. A lot of people are trying to scramble out 
of our business." 
</P>
<P>
Tough competition in the industry and negative press over Heidi's financial 
woes and problems with its franchisees have intensified Heidi's problems. 
Pallas said. It also has brought a tendency among creditors to file lawsuits 
against Heidi's to ensure protection of the creditors' interests, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Heidi's has a tentative agreement to merge with Steve's Homemade Ice Cream of 
New York.

FOR THOSE WHO LIKE TO VACATION, TRAVEL, CAMP -- IT'S SHOW TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
If your idea of roughing it is a night or two at the Holiday Inn, the Anaheim 
Sports, Vacation &amp; RV Show won't be your idea of a good time. 
</P>
<P>
If, on the other hand, you're one of those folks who can't get enough of 
mosquito-slapping in the great outdoors or bagging your own wild boar, the 24th 
annual show that starts today can keep you fascinated for hours. 
</P>
<P>
The 9-day show features more than 600 exhibits with people selling everything 
from glacier-climbing treks through Wyoming to rockhounding and bird-watching 
excursions. 
</P>
<P>
Where else can you find recreational vehicles with queen-size beds, slide-out 
rooms and TV monitors for backing out of a tight spot? Where else can you watch 
log rollers on roller skates or "Mr. Sound Effects," Wes Harrison, who imitates 
full-scale air raids and jet aircraft taking off? Or how about signing up for 
fishing trips to Venezuela or hot-air balloon trips that will have you skimming 
the surface of a white-water river? 
</P>
<P>
The show reflects the increasing popularity of vacations in out-of-the-way 
spots, its promoters say. "People are finding that they certainly can travel 
much cheaper in an RV, where they don't have to spend money in a coffee shop or 
stay in a hotel," said Sharon Buck, the show's producer. At the same time, she 
said, the aging of the baby boom is bringing more people into the market for 
more adventuresome, exotic outdoorsy trips -- such as angling and dog-sledding 
in Alaska or covered-wagon trips through Montana. 
</P>
<P>
One result is that in 2 years, the annual show plans to expand from its current 
300,000 square feet -- about the size of 12 football fields -- to 400,000 
square feet. That means that there should be about 100 more exhibits added to 
the present 600, Buck said. 
</P>
<P>
Buck's hopes for the current show, which runs through Jan. 15 at the Anaheim 
Convention Center, are that about 250,000 people will plunk down the $6.50 
admission fee for adults ($2.25 for children). That may be a tad optimistic, 
considering that show promoters estimated last year's attendance at close to 
90,000. 
</P>
<P>
But to hear exhibitors tell it, at least, there is no doubting that catering to 
nature-minded vacationeers has become big business. 
</P>
<P>
Take Anglers Travel Connection in Torrance, for instance. Owner Chet Young 
caters almost exclusively to the travel fisherman, booking trips to Alaska, 
Canada and Mexico. The excursions range from $177 for 3 nights and 2 days of 
panga fishing in Baja to $3,750 for a week of fishing and deluxe lodging in 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Since he started the company 6 years ago, Young estimates that business has 
climbed 30% to 40% each year. "People are more oriented to leisure every year," 
he said. "And fishing is the No. 1 participation sport." After all, Young 
added, "There are more than 1.5 million fishing licenses in Southern California 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, exhibitors like Young were busily setting up their 
displays of brochures, gigantic color posters, and camping tents and equipment. 
Stuffed moose heads littered the floor next to huge, mounted salmon. And while 
most convention floors are blanketed with people in three-piece suits, at the 
Sports, Vacation and RV Show, red-checkered wool shirts and khaki and olive 
green jackets were de rigueur. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the floor space is taken up by another high-grossing business -- 
recreational vehicles. With its year-round sunny weather and dense population, 
it is small wonder that Southern California is called the RV Capitol of the 
World. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 RV models are on display at the show. 
</P>
<P>
They include the 37-foot Overland, a diesel model with rear engine that comes 
equipped with solid wood cabinets, leather seats and dash and an electric sofa 
that converts into a bed at the push of a button. "You can sip your martini 
while the bed is being made," said Bruce Lassiter, owner of Lassiter's RV 
Center in Irvine, which is displaying the Overland. 
</P>
<P>
The creme-de-la-creme model is priced for quick sale at $129,000. That's small 
change compared to some of the ultra-deluxe custom jobs selling for more than 
$500,000. In all, an assortment of the latest RVs and accessories valued at 
more than $15 million are on display for sale, according to Corrine Sidney, the 
show's publicity director. 
</P>
<P>
But the displays don't stop with exhibits and motor homes. Just down the halls 
are other diversions. 
</P>
<P>
You've heard of the casting couch. How about the casting pond? The show's 
"Tackle Row" -- a group of fishing products' exhibits -- are right by an 
80-foot-long pond that is used to demonstrate fly fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are fishing clinics, seminars on RV maintenance and High Sierra 
fishing, and an International Travel Film Festival that includes movies on how 
to lure just about every kind of fish you can catch.

Two cast changes were announced Friday for the New York City Opera engagement 
that begins Jan. 17 at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. According to 
Center officials, Jon Garrison will sing the Duke of Mantua in Verdi's 
"Rigoletto" on Jan. 19, instead of the originally announced Frederic Kalt. No 
explanation for the change was given. Garrison also will sing the Duke on Jan. 
17, as announced. Garrison had been scheduled to sing Tamino in Mozart's "Die 
Zauberflote" on Jan. 20. He now will be replaced by Walter MacNeil. MacNeil 
will sing the role Jan. 18, too, as originally scheduled.

SOUTH COAST SYMPHONY STARTS TO REDUCE DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of the South Coast Symphony on Friday said they are progressing 
toward solving the orchestra's deficit problem and are beginning to raise the 
$140,000 necessary to continue its season as now scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Rodheim, a member of a task force formed to address the financial 
situation, announced a grant "in excess of $10,000" from Fred S. James &amp; 
Co., an insurance firm in Irvine. Rodheim also said a donation from the Irvine 
Co. has been promised. Fund-raising efforts have netted another $11,000, 
orchestra manager Doreen Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of declining ticket sales, the orchestra faces a shortfall of about 
$30,000 and needs another $110,000 to present the two concerts it has 
announced, Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the task force has recommended the formation of a three-member board 
of directors to run the organization for up to a year, task-force member Sally 
Anne Sheridan said Friday. The interim board will have to be approved by the 
full, 18-member board on Jan. 17, Sheridan said. 
</P>
<P>
A triumvirate could operate as a "leaner, meaner board to get us through this 
crisis period," task force chairman Peter Buffa said. The three members, to be 
announced after the Jan. 17 meeting, are being selected "because of their 
commitment to the symphony, for their ability to get things done, and their 
contacts," Sheridan said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 12-member task force will keep "searching for the money and 
trying to get as many commitments as we can to save the (rest of the) season," 
Sheridan said. 
</P>
<P>
Remaining concerts are scheduled for March 4 at Santa Ana High School and April 
29 at Orange Coast College.

EXUDE WINS MTV'S VIDEO COMPETITION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Exude, a rock band from Anaheim, won MTV's monthly "Basement Tapes" contest 
Thursday for its video "Safe With You," an AIDS-awareness song. Exude's victory 
over three other groups means that MTV will play the video six times over the 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to help a lot," said Exude's singer, Frank Rogala. "It's going to 
be great exposure." 
</P>
<P>
It won't be the first time the band has been in the national spotlight: Exude 
won Musician Magazine's "Best Unsigned Band in America" contest in 1987 and was 
included with nine other groups on a record produced by Warner Bros. and 
circulated among the recording industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody better sign us because we're not letting these other bands have a 
chance to win these contests," Rogala said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, "the music business seems a little cautious when it comes to us," 
Rogala said, adding that he hopes the MTV award might finally earn the group a 
recording contract.

POSTNUCLEAR BEER DECISION DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Laguna Beach Board of Adjustment put off until Jan. 19 a decision whether 
to permit beer sales at Club Postnuclear, a rock concert venue at 775 Laguna 
Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was to have been reached Thursday but, according to Jack Connors, 
zoning administrator for the city, improper notices went out to area residents. 
</P>
<P>
The club opened in July with a no-alcohol, no-smoking policy; only soft drinks, 
cappuccino and espresso are sold. 
</P>
<P>
But club owner William (Max) Nee said recently that about half his customers 
have said they would like to have beer. By adding beer sales, Postnuclear also 
could expand its potential draw, Nee said. MARK I. PINSKY

FAMILY LIFE: THE SNIFFLES ALL AROUND BRING MISERY, CLOSENESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The kids and I took time out to stop and smell the flowers this week. The 
problem was, we couldn't smell anything. 
</P>
<P>
We hadn't exactly planned it that way. Our household calendar was cluttered 
with entries for the first days after the holidays: a consultation with my 
son's orthodontist, another with my attorney, carburetor work on the car. Then 
there was a belated holiday dinner with one friend and penciled-in lunch plans 
with another, not to mention a full schedule of work and school and a long list 
of errands that had already been put off too long. We were going to get a 
productive, fast-paced start on the new year. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the only appointment we were able to keep wasn't even on the 
list: a group expedition to the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
"I might as well get a rubber stamp for these symptoms," said the nurse as she 
wrote down three separate lists of similar complaints: stuffy nose, fever, 
cough, headache and so on. "All our patients seem to have the same thing. I 
just hope we don't get it." 
</P>
<P>
"Hello, everybody," said the doctor as he strode briskly into the examining 
room. "Who's first?" 
</P>
<P>
No bickering, for once, about whose turn it was to go first for something. My 
daughter, by virtue of her 102-degree fever, won that contest without a 
struggle -- not that she or her brother could have put up much of a fight. 
</P>
<P>
"A very bad cold," the doctor proclaimed after the usual peeking and prodding. 
But before I could blurt out, "I could have told you that!" he went on. 
Bronchitis. An ear infection. Not good news, but at least I didn't have to feel 
guilty or embarrassed about bothering the doctor for something I could have 
handled myself. 
</P>
<P>
My son didn't have bronchitis. But he had two ear infections to make up for it. 
</P>
<P>
I was last. "Moms always go last," the doctor said. My problem was merely a 
stubborn sinus infection, come back to life like the villain in a horror movie 
despite our assault on it 2 weeks ago with a $67 round of antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
After explaining the purpose of each prescription and reciting the usual 
instructions -- rest, fluids, more rest, more fluids -- the doctor wished us 
well and sent us off to fend for ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
We coughed our way to the car, which, thanks to the aforementioned carburetor 
problem, did some coughing of its own. "Listen, Mom," my daughter said. "The 
car has it too." We laughed, and coughed some more. 
</P>
<P>
I dropped the kids off at home, then hurried down to the drugstore with our 
prescriptions and the gold card I would need to pay for them. The usual 
20-minute wait was an hour and a half this time. "We're swamped," the 
pharmacist explained. Somehow I knew what he was going to say next. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has it," he told me. 
</P>
<P>
When I got home, the kids were parked under comforters on the couch, taking 
advantage of the unspoken suspension of household rules by sipping soda pop (In 
the living room! In the morning!) and watching the same TV shows my brother and 
I watched on our sick days 20-plus years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"What's wrong, little buddy?" asked a portly man in a nautical cap on the 
screen, looking somehow inappropriate in color. Oh, Skipper, I thought. Where 
do I begin? But Gilligan launched into his tale of woe before I could get 
started on mine. 
</P>
<P>
Gilligan's red shirt and rosy cheeks weren't all that had changed since I was a 
kid. Instead of lying down in front of the television, I was on my feet in the 
kitchen -- antibiotics or no antibiotics, we had to have Mom's Chicken Soup, 
and I was the only one around here who answered to "Mom." 
</P>
<P>
"This is really good, Mom," my son said politely as he sampled a spoonful an 
hour later. "I just wish I could taste it." 
</P>
<P>
"Me too," I said. 
</P>
<P>
They took naps; I rushed to meet a deadline. I don't know how my mother ever 
managed without a computer and a modem, not to mention videotapes and 
microwaves. And she went through many more episodes of this than I'll ever 
face. My brother and I got the measles -- both kinds. My children got vaccines 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
By 7 p.m., the doctors and nurses on "MASH" were rushing around trying to deal 
with another episode of emergencies, and so was I. 
</P>
<P>
"His leg is crushed. Get this one to pre-op, stat!" 
</P>
<P>
"Mom, I just barfed!" 
</P>
<P>
"Mom, my nose is bleeding!" 
</P>
<P>
"Incoming choppers!" 
</P>
<P>
I mopped and wiped and hugged and consoled as fast as I could. In between 
crises, I took a few self-indulgent moments to lie down myself -- but never for 
very long. Even after I tucked them in for the night, I listened for coughing 
and feeble cries for my attention, just as I'd done night after night when they 
were infants. Those instincts were rusty but still functioning, I discovered, 
at 1:18 a.m. and 2:37 a.m. and 4:02 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Their fevers had broken the next morning, and as I put away the thermometer, I 
proclaimed with nurse-like cheer that the worst was over. 
</P>
<P>
"But my nose is still stopped up," one of them complained. 
</P>
<P>
"Mine too," said the other. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't say it was over. I said the worst was over." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh." 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing good about being sick," my daughter moaned. Yes there is, I 
thought, but I didn't contradict her out loud. We may have been miserable, but 
we were together, and paying closer attention to each other than we had in 
months. 
</P>
<P>
By the second evening, they were burned out on TV. "How about reading?" I 
suggested. But they said their heads hurt too much. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's try something with bigger type," I suggested. "Maybe that won't hurt." 
So we dug out an old favorite, a book that was long since supposed to have been 
handed down to their little cousins in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
The sun did not shine, 
</P>
<P>
It was too wet to play, 
</P>
<P>
So we sat in the house 
</P>
<P>
All that cold, cold wet day.... 
</P>
<P>
 As my daughter read, I realized that I still knew the words by heart. 
</P>
<P>
 ... And then something went BUMP! How that bump made us jump! 
</P>
<P>
... We looked! And we saw him! The Cat in the Hat! 
</P>
<P>
 For a moment, I was 10 years younger, and so were they. Then my son broke the 
spell. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't it interesting how the fish takes on the role of the parent?" he said, 
making it profoundly clear that he was no longer a 3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
I almost started crying, but I blew my nose instead. Where had all that time 
gone? And why hadn't we spent more of it this close? 
</P>
<P>
We're better now, thank you -- still coughing and sniffling, but much better. 
And next week, we're going to be frantically busy. But in spite of everything, 
we seem to have started out the new year exactly as we should have. 
</P>
<P>
I just wish there was an easier way to clear the calendar.

THEY SPREAD THE WORD TO THOSE WHO CAN'T READ

<P>
The 27-year-old gardener's Little League team had won all its games since he 
began coaching -- a proud accomplishment for the shy, burly young man. 
</P>
<P>
But before the season ended, he abruptly resigned. He quit because the league 
office required some paper work, and the fact was that he could neither read 
nor write. 
</P>
<P>
He is not alone. About 27 million Americans are classified as functionally 
illiterate. That means about 1 in 5 adults in the nation -- and the estimates 
are identical for Orange County -- are unable to read a medicine bottle, want 
ad, phone book or bus schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Literacy Council and its three offspring organizations are 
working to change those statistics. Last year more than 3,000 Orange County 
residents received free tutorial help from the organizations' 1,000 volunteers 
in rooms supplied by high schools, libraries and churches. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest problems is convincing people to accept the help. 
</P>
<P>
"There is such a stigma (associated with illiteracy), many people are too 
embarrassed to admit it," said Estelle Rosenthal, a tutor and board member of 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
"If they come to us, we can help them, but they have to 'come out of the 
closet.' Many are afraid to do this and lead terrible lives of frustration and 
deceit, with low self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Literacy Council was founded 18 years ago and is strictly 
nonprofit, charging nothing for its services and depending entirely on 
volunteers. It has since given birth to councils offering services in Orange, 
the central county and the north county. They use the Laubach method of 
teaching, a system developed by the late Dr. Frank C. Laubach, called "Mr. 
Literacy" by Time magazine and "the greatest teacher of our time" by Lowell 
Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
It was as a missionary in the Philippines in the 1930s that Laubach discovered 
the value of key words to aid students in identifying sounds. He drew worldwide 
attention with his methods and rallying cry of "Each One Teach One." In 1955, 
he founded Laubach Literacy International. 
</P>
<P>
Although the program handles both American and foreign-born students, the 
latter studying English as a Second Language, Rosenthal specializes in people 
who have lived here all their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who contact us are tutored in total privacy," said Rosenthal, 66, a 
retired administrative secretary whose own immigrant parents were tutored in 
English by volunteers in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
"Student anonymity is preserved unless they wish to break it. Once their 
self-esteem is heightened because of their newly learned skills, they start 
feeling proud of their accomplishments and, like many religious converts, begin 
extolling the benefits of literacy and the program." 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case of a 49-year-old successful salesman named Jim who earned 
between $60,000 and $80,000 a year, yet could not read and could write only his 
name, address and numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"He had developed an incredible memory to compensate for his lack of literacy," 
Rosenthal said. "He once said that he wasn't stupid, just that he couldn't 
read. He has been in our program now for 6 months. 
</P>
<P>
"He recently started to tell me a story which points out the indignities an 
illiterate faces on a day-to-day basis. I asked him to write it down as part of 
his homework. This poignant piece is the most he has written in his life." 
</P>
<P>
Here is what Jim wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 I want to tell you about traffic school. I got there at 8 in the morning. The 
teacher gave us a card to fill out. It was not hard to do. When class started, 
he asked people to read. I was lucky he did not call on me. 
</P>
<P>
 At 10 a.m. we had a coffee break. I went outside to meet him. I told him that 
I could not read. He said, "How did you fill out the card?" I said it was easy, 
it was just your name and address and only numbers. So he said that he would 
not embarrass me. After the coffee break we started class, and it was fun. 
</P>
<P>
 After our lunch break he gave us a book of traffic laws. He asked people to 
read and then he looked at me and said, "Would you read the next paragraph? Oh, 
I am sorry, I said I would not embarrass you." Well, he already did. So I stood 
up and told the class that I was illiterate; that I did not know how to read, 
but I am going to school to learn how, and I feel good about it.... 
</P>
<P>
 I have a wife and two children. I have made good money in the past years. The 
only time I was ashamed was when my 3-year-old daughter asked me to read her a 
story and I couldn't. That is a shame. A man stood up and said, "I have a 
22-year-old son and he cannot read. May I have your phone number? I would like 
him to talk to you after school." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal said self-esteem definitely rises with students as they progress in 
their studies. Robert, the gardener, used to come to his lessons with head down 
and not look at his tutor for the whole hour. Little by little, he is opening 
up, smiling and discussing the problem. At a recent lesson he was able to read 
a few words in a newspaper. His mother said he was so thrilled, he came 
directly home and asked her to order daily delivery of a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
How did he manage to graduate from a Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., high school without 
being able to read or write? "All through school I was overlooked," the shy, 
sunburned gardener said haltingly. "I was in slow-learner classes, and I just 
got shuffled through the system. They told me I would never be able to learn to 
read. I hate them for that." 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason for illiteracy -- but many causes of it," said Rosenthal, 
recently named Retired Senior Volunteer Program Tutor by Laubach Literacy 
International. "Adult illiterates may quit school, or have learning 
disabilities. He or she may have a physical or emotional disability, or be 
uninterested in learning at an early age. There might have been a traumatic 
period or incident. The teacher may have been ineffective, or the individual 
may not have been motivated to learn to read." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the functionally illiterate, Rosenthal said, another 47 million 
Americans are categorized as marginally literate -- able to read, write and 
compute but unable to use these skills proficiently. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 "Each One Teach One" is free to any adult who wants to learn to read, write 
and speak English. Prospective tutors and students may call (800) 228-8813 for 
the location of the nearest teaching facility.

PHOTOGRAPHY: HAZE DOESN'T HAVE TO LEAVE YOU IN A FOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Those who watched last Saturday's National Football League playoff game between 
the Bears and Philadelphia Eagles in Chicago saw the problems fog can cause 
camera operators. 
</P>
<P>
It was extremely difficult to see what was going on because the long lenses in 
television cameras condense the fog, making it look very thick. That's an 
example of how a camera can work against you. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, reader Mary Kay Stein of Laguna Niguel wrote asking for 
suggestions on shooting pictures on foggy days. With the right amount of 
knowledge, you can turn just about any circumstance into an opportunity to 
create some interesting pictures. 
</P>
<P>
A day of adverse weather is a great time to experiment. Of course, there are 
times when the fog is just too thick to do anything. But most of the time you 
can use the fog to diffuse the light in your picture. 
</P>
<P>
Fog is nothing more than water vapor condensed in very fine particles. Fog 
usually occurs when there is a large contrast in temperatures. It is usually 
found around water on cold days because the air is much colder than the water. 
It can also be found in valleys because the warmer temperatures surrounding the 
valley trap the cold air. 
</P>
<P>
Fog can help your photography in three ways: First, it can create a mood; 
second, it lowers the contrast in your photo and, finally, it helps isolate 
your subject by eliminating the background. 
</P>
<P>
A picture taken in the fog often has an eerie or surrealistic mood. Notice how 
many horror films use fog to create a feeling of impending danger. If this is 
what you're looking for, you don't have to wait for a foggy day. Many 
professionals either have or rent fog machines to create this kind of mood. 
</P>
<P>
Fog can also lower the contrast in your photos, which can be of great benefit. 
You don't have to worry about harsh shadows caused by the sun. 
</P>
<P>
Exposure is an important factor when considering contrast. It's important to 
know what you want to highlight in your photograph. If you are looking for an 
overall scene, you should get a light reading off the fog. If you're trying to 
capture a subject that is small in the frame and the meter reading is off the 
fog, the subject will be very dark or a silhouette. That can be an effective 
technique. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you want a normal exposure of your subject, you should move in 
closer to get the proper light reading. But this will brighten or blow out your 
background. Always use several different exposures because it's almost 
impossible to get what you want in one try. The right exposure is not always 
the best exposure because the film may interpret a scene differently than your 
eye does. This is especially true when using color slide film. 
</P>
<P>
Fog is also very effective at isolating your subject. It gives you the same 
effect as using a large aperture (f/2 or f/2.8) with a long lens. The longer 
the lens, the more diffused your subject will be. A similar effect can be 
achieved if you use a soft-focus filter. 
</P>
<P>
There is one drawback to shooting in the fog. If it is especially damp, keep 
your camera in a case when it's not in use. Avoid setting it down on the ground 
because the moisture can erode and rust parts of your camera.

HORSES: MINIATURE HORSES MEASURE UP WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAULA VOORHEES, Paula Voorhees is a regular contributor to Orange County 
Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Evita and Juan are alive and well in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Acclimating well, too, except maybe for showing some irritation over renditions 
of the song, "Short People Ain't Got Nobody." 
</P>
<P>
Juan and Evita are miniature horses purchased at Argentina's world-famed 
Falabella breeding farm by Pam and Gary Ziebarth of San Juan Capistrano. The 
minis from that farm are a special and unique breed arrived at after many 
generations of selection and crossings of small English Shetlands and a small 
specimen of the local Carillo race. 
</P>
<P>
Their average height is 28 inches, measured from the base of the top hairs of 
the mane to the ground while standing squarely. Their adult weight ranges from 
40 to 60 pounds, not much more than a large dog. 
</P>
<P>
"We really didn't go to Argentina with the idea of buying two minis," Pam said. 
"We had read about the farm in a tour book and, since we both love animals, 
decided to visit. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw about 600 head grazing on 2,000 acres of land . . . and we just 
couldn't resist." 
</P>
<P>
It was an expensive impulse -- about $15,000 for the horses, transportation and 
a week in quarantine when they arrived in the United States -- but probably not 
a bad investment, considering a Falabella stud just sold at auction in Oregon 
for $32,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Ziebarths plan to breed their pair next spring. 
</P>
<P>
The big question is: If you can't ride them (and you certainly can't if you 
weigh more than 50 pounds), what are they good for? 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask my husband, the answer would probably be 'nothing,' " said Pam, who 
goes on to provide some different answers. "Taking care of these little ones 
was my two sons' first experience with horses. They learned all about horse 
care without becoming intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
"They learned how to take a horse's temperature, how to clip a horse, groom it 
-- how to teach them ground manners and more without the fear of being kicked 
or run over in the process." 
</P>
<P>
Many owners of minis are known to keep them at home (even in the house!), but 
the Ziebarth pair are stabled at the Ortega Equestrian Center, where "they've 
become sort of mascots," according to Pam. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Coffey, an Orange County breeder of minis, says the little horses are 
perfect for older people who are no longer physically able to handle full-sized 
breeds. Plus, there's the obvious matter of space. "You can have eight minis in 
an area that would only house one full-sized horse," says Coffey, who has 22 
minis on her property in Newport's Back Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"Because they were bred down from English Shetlands that were used to pull ore 
from mines, they are extremely strong as well and make excellent driving 
horses." 
</P>
<P>
Serious breeding of minis in the United States was begun in the 1950s by West 
Virginian Smith McCoy, who eventually developed a herd of 100 of what then were 
called "midget Shetlands." Failing health forced him to sell off the herd in 
1967. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 10 years passed before the formation of the American Miniature Horse 
Assn., now the only registry in existence dealing exclusively with true 
miniatures. 
</P>
<P>
To be registered, a horse must stand no more than 34 inches in height. The 
association's Standard of Perfection calls for a "small, sound, well-balanced 
horse possessing the good conformation characteristics common to most breeds; 
showing refinement and femininity in the mare and boldness and masculinity in 
the stallion. It should give the impression of strength, agility and 
alertness." 
</P>
<P>
In a move designed to purify the bloodlines and maintain height, the 
association closed the registry, effective Dec. 31, 1987. That means that only 
those horses with a registered sire or dam are eligible for listing. There are 
about 30,000 American miniatures registered at this time. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Coffey's pet-quality minis start at $1,800, but the cost of show-quality 
animals can run into five figures.
